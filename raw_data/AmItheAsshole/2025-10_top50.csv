1nvg74z,[ Removed by moderator ],"I bought a fixer-upper in my 20s with my now ex. I bought him out, but agreed to give him back his portion of deposit he paid upon sale whenever that may be. 

We remained friends as we've known eachother since childhood, regardless of that I still plan to stick to my work 8 years later.

I told him I was in the process of selling the house, he asked me if I had any offers and i told him yeah but from a few landlords. I didn't think that needed further explanation because he knows full well how I feel about landlords buying up starter homes in lower income areas, and how strongly I felt about turning this house into a home for myself and the next occupants.

He's absolutely furious at me for not going for a quick sale because he wants his measley 5k back _now_. I told him no way, and tried to remind him of all the offers we made on starter homes that just got swept up by landlords. It was devastating and we almost lost all hope of getting on the property ladder. None of them wanted this one because it needed so much work.

He's blowing my phone up, and told my parents who are more gently telling me to just go for the easy sale but I'm in no rush to move and want all my hard work to go to a family instead of someones business. AITA?

Edit: giving him the 5K specifically from the sale has been discussed over messages many times in the past. If I just give him 5k now, he could still say I owe him from the sale of the house. Getting him out was a nightmare as he can be pretty nasty. Most of the time he's fine but he suddenly switches and ""goes to war"" with people.",Hideious,8167,752,0.9200000166893005,0.8563981042654029,1759343128,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nvg74z/aita_for_refusing_to_sell_my_house_to_a_landlord/,2025,10

1nwiyxd,"AITA (42M) for refusing to keep helping my 87M neighbor, even though my mom (70F) and half my family say I’m being heartless?","I (42M) live next door to “Bill” (87M). He’s been my neighbor for about 15 years, and for the past two I’ve been helping him out a lot: groceries, rides to appointments, fixing small things around his house.

Here’s the problem: Bill has started treating me like his personal caretaker. He calls at random hours for stuff that isn’t urgent (like moving his couch or resetting his router). Last month, he called me during my work meeting because he “couldn’t figure out his thermostat.”

I told him I can’t always drop everything, and he blew up, saying younger people owe the elderly their time.

Now here’s where the drama escalates:

My mom (70F) says I should keep helping because “someday you’ll be old and hope someone helps you.”

My sister (39F) told me I was cruel for setting boundaries.

My brother (44M) says Bill is manipulative and I need to stop.

My wife (40F) is furious because I keep missing dinners and family time to deal with Bill.

My cousin (36M) actually sided with Bill (!!) and told me I was “selfish” because I don’t have kids at home anymore, so I have “more free time.” I don't am literally a nurse in their 40s

My friend (41M) says I should call social services or a senior support group instead of trying to do it all.


So now it’s me against half my family + Bill. Mom and my sister think I’m abandoning an old man who “has no one else.” My wife and brother are on my side that Bill is taking advantage. Cousin keeps guilt-tripping me.

I feel like I’m stuck if I keep helping, I’m drained and my marriage suffers. If I stop, I’m the “cold neighbor who turned his back on an old man.

1nvei9i,AITA Service Dog had to Act like its in Public,"Throwaway…

Next weekend, I am hosting a party for my 4 year old Son and extended family are invited.  One family member has a service dog.  I don't like dogs.  They brought up the service dog coming and I okayed it, but I laid out some rules.  Basically, they had to act like they were going to a public place.  No going to the bathroom, no feeding it, stays off furniture, no being loose and playing, no barking.  I told them I expected it to act like it was working the entire time.  

Officially on the invite this was a two hour party, then i expected most people to leave.  This family member has told me this is ridiculous and i'm an asshole. They expected more from family and these rules were absurd.   They declined the invitation and communicated they declined to other families.   Its caused drama and I've been hearing it from others.  AITA?

1nvjkek,AITA Roomate decided to use the washer which I was repairing And flooded the hardwood floor. The repairs cost $800 and she won't pay it.,"I rent a house with two other roommates (so three of us total). A while back, our washer started having a drainage issue where water would stay inside at the end of the cycle. I did some plumbing work/snaking to fix it, and while I was working on it one of my roommates (Jess) decided to run a load of laundry.

Problem is, the drainage hose on the back of the washer wasn’t positioned correctly at that point, so water flooded the laundry room and part of the kitchen. Jess tried to clean it up, but the hardwood floors are now buckling. The repair estimate came out to $800.

Here’s the issue: Jess is blaming me, saying it’s my fault. From my perspective, I was already actively working on the washer. She could have called/texted me or waited, but instead ran it anyway while it wasn’t fully set up.

My other roommate (Judson) thinks it “could have happened to anyone” and suggests we just split the cost three ways.

I’ve been clear and responsive about everything, but I don’t think it’s fair that I should cover this. Am I wrong to think Jess should be responsible for the repair? Or do I need to just bite the bullet and split it?",AdApart9610,981,469,0.9399999976158142,0.28233365462788923,1759350554,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nvjkek/aita_roomate_decided_to_use_the_washer_which_i/,2025,10

1nwbozu,[ Removed by moderator ],"I (26f) was vending at a local craft fair last weekend. I make little crochet dolls and accessories and they've been pretty popular with my friends/acquaintances so I thought I'd try selling them for once and see if I liked it. I price everything pretty cheap all things considered, and I mostly just wanted to make enough to cover my table fee and maybe get a nice lunch after. I usually just give my stuff away so my friends had to kind of push me to price things appropriately at all lol. I had a pretty straightforward display with all the prices on signs in front of the items.

Around halfway through the day, a dad and his kid (around 8 maybe?) were lingering around my area of the craft fair and looking over. I'd seen them  walk past my table and look a few times, but I didn't want to be a pushy salesperson so I just smiled and kept busy crocheting in my lap. After a while when the kid finally came up and asked for one of the dolls on display. I told her the price and she handed me a few bills that were maybe 1/3 of the price and said that was all she had.

 I was tempted to just let her have it, but there was a lot of time left at the fair to sell things to people at full price. And I thought it was kind of weird that her dad had seemingly told her to haggle with me that low when my prices are low already. So I just told her that sorry, it's the price on the sign, and she got upset and said that she really wanted it. I told her the doll costs more than what she has and handed her the money back. She whined a bit and ran back to her dad.

He came up and asked me if I was really not going to let a little girl have a doll and that my prices were ridiculous. I didn't really know what to say, so I just kind of stared awkwardly for a moment before repeating that the prices are on the signs and apologizing again. He kind of grumbled that I was ridiculous again and him and his kid walked off. They kept passing by for like an hour after and glaring at me, and before the left the dad came up again and asked me if I ever made any sales with this kind of business practice. I didn't want to argue with him anymore so I just kind of ignored him and smiled at someone else walking by. He stood there glaring at me for a really long minute and then just stomped off.

I feel like an asshole because under normal circumstances I do just give away my stuff. And if it had been closer to the end of the day i mightve been more open to haggling just to have less stuff to take home. But I didn't like that the kid seemed to kind of expect I'd just give her my hard work for less without a reason, and, like... her dad could've forked over the rest of the money if he really wanted her to have the doll. At the same time though I kind of priced things with the hope that anybody who really wanted something could probably afford it, and I wasn't exactly out with the goal of making a ton of money, so I felt like i was being kind of inconsistent with telling her no on principle.",DullSoft5678,1490,214,0.9599999785423279,0.19264256744719388,1759429467,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nwbozu/aita_for_not_giving_a_discount_to_a_kid/,2025,10
1nvl29c,AITA for dying my beard,"I (42M) am both bald and bearded. If I still had hair on the top of my head, I'm pretty sure it would be going grey. My natural hair/beard colour is a very dark brown/black, and honestly, I just don't like the grey in my beard because it's not distributed in a salt-and-pepper way, but more a piebald pony way. So, I dye it. I'm entirely open about this- because I'm an idle bastard I can go from patchy black-and-grey beard to solid black overnight, and I'm the kind of clown who will say to my mates ""look! I did my beard!"" I should also add that dyed beard or undyed beard, I look my age. I'm clearly a 42 year old man with a beard and male pattern baldness: I do not dye my beard to look younger.

Two days ago, a younger colleague (24ishF) and I were in the break area, and she said ""Dude, I need to call you out on this beard thing. Stop dying it, we all know it's grey.  Dying it is predator behaviour.""

Here's where I might have been the asshole: I pointed out that she is not a natural blonde, and if me dying my beard is predator behaviour, surely her dying her hair is also predator behaviour. She called me a prick and walked off, and since then her particular couple of friends at work have been cold with me. They've also been ""blowing up my phone"" (i.e. two of them messaged me on Teams telling me I was out of order, one deleted the message hoping I hadn't read it), and said colleague isn't speaking to me.

1nwjh8n,[ Removed by moderator ],"I 22m graduated in the spring and started my first full time job in June. I was really hoping I'd get hired here and was very excited when I got the job. My girlfriend 20f hasn't graduated college yet, so she still lives on campus and works part time in the school cafeteria. I have no issue with her doing this and think that it's very respectable she is working and juggling school work as well. 

My work invited me to a team dinner this week and told me I was allowed to bring a guest. Obviously, I chose my girlfriend and asked her about coming. She was very excited and agreed to come. She asked me some questions to get a general vibe of how the dinner would be. I told her that my coworkers were a little older than me (like early thirties or older) and pretty professional, so I was wondering if she could not mention what she does for work at the dinner. I wasn't making a demand or anything, I just didn't want my coworkers looking down on her when she could easily avoid the topic and not bring it up. 

She got really upset and told me that she feels like I'm embarrassed by her, which is not true. She's also saying she doesn't want to come to the dinner anymore because I ""don't respect her,"" which is absolutely not what I feel. I wasn't trying to downplay her job, I just didn't want any of my coworkers judging her (or me by extension) at a new job I really care about. I tried to call her about it to explain it better, but she just claimed ""if I'm not good enough to come as is, I don't want to be included."" This makes me really sad because I was excited to share such a big part of my life with her.

1nwbsn2,AITA for telling a man I can take care of myself?,"Hello, my mum’s married friend (M, possibly early to late 50s) has been texting me (F26) and checking up on me while my mum is out of the country. I’m an adult and don’t need someone checking in, but I do appreciate his concern.

Right now I’m unemployed, so he’s been sending me job recommendations too, which I appreciate. However, I decided to put some distance after he suggested taking me to the movies someday, which made me uncomfortable.

Here’s the conversation we had:

Me:
“Thanks for checking in, but you don’t need to. I can take care of myself, including job searching. Appreciate your understanding. 😊👍🏻”

Him:
“Am very sorry for intruding into your life, just bcos you said you will be looking for job and am trying to get you a highly paid one. If you are offended, i apologised ok. Bye”

My mum just texted me saying that he’s upset and asked if I offended him. She insisted that he was just being friendly all along. I also showed my response to a friend, and he said I was rude too.

1nwh1is,[ Removed by moderator ],"Final edit: i will be leaving him by the end of October. As others have mentioned he is not an adult but a child in adult pants. I have made a post on a donation sub that i regret, not bc “people found out” but because i let a scumbag pressure me into something i didnt want to do.

I appreciate the feedback from the past few hours, yall have given me a lot to think about like why im even with him to start. No i am not against going to a food bank/pantry, but i am against abusing help to a disgusting point. If i can manage for while i wont be using help like a food pantry when i could apply for snap or other benefits and leave that resource to those who truly need it. (Not to say im not in need, but this is a very small town, and idk everyone here to confidently say there arent women and children who would need it more than me.)

————————————
Reposting* bc i messed up with the automod thing (i think) not used to reddit and this is my second post ever

Bit of background: My partner (36) and I (22) have been struggling financially. We both lost our jobs within a week of each other, but we each found new jobs after about a month and a half. Neither of us had savings and we were both living paycheck to paycheck before we even met.

Right now I make about $10 an hour and have been trying to save as much as possible, but it’s been hard. We’ve been relying on food banks and the generosity of friends and family to get by. We currently have plenty of soup, frozen meat, and canned goods at home, which is more than enough to stretch for at least another week if we plan our meals right.

The issue I’m struggling with: my partner wants to go back to the local food bank now, even though we just went less than a week ago. I suggested we wait until next week to go again so we don’t overuse it and so we make sure to use what we already have. We did overindulge the first few days just bc it had been some time since we had a proper meal, but now I’m being more careful about portions and making things last.

On top of that, I’ve been asking him to gather some documents (like our rent agreement) because one of the ladies at the food bank said she could help us apply for SNAP. He hasn’t done it, and honestly I feel a little embarrassed about going back again without showing any progress toward getting more stable. I don’t want it to look like we’re just relying on them without trying.

Now he’s sulking and saying, “No, I’m fine,” even though it’s obvious he’s upset that we’re not going back right away.

TL;DR My partner wants to go back to a food pantry we just went to 6 days ago and i said no we should wait and use food we have now. Now he is sulking and ignoring me and i feel i may have been overthinking it and should have gone anyway with him.

So, WIBTA for insisting we use up what we have first before going back to the food bank?


edit: im not *against* going back completely, but its been 6 days since we last went and we still have food from the 2 last trips.

And for those who have been questioning why i asked for money on a different reddit to get groceries- that was on his insistence. I didnt *want* to make the post, i even told him to do it himself, but he wore me down after *weeks* of asking me to ask other people for money.

The cost? £800 per person.

I politely said I couldn’t afford that right now. Moneys tight but also I don’t think I’d enjoy it, I prefer cocktails and pubs than goop wellness stuff. She got really upset and said I’m “not supporting her passion” and that this was meant to be an “investment in our friendship.”

I told her I’d love to hang out one-on-one or do something more low-key (like a spa day, or even just a regular weekend away), but she insists it has to be the retreat.

1nvfeg8,AITA for asking my wife to take the battery out of her e-bike to prevent theft,"So last year the e-bike I bought with my monry was stolen because she left it locked but not attached to anything in the train station bycicle storage. It's a notorious place for thieves so naturally it was stolen after 1 night. She paid me back for the bike

Then she bought a new expensive e-bike. She bought a litelok x1 for it (on my advice). She uses the bycicle to go to her work and her dancing school. At the dancing school it's a crappy bycicle rack with thin steel bars that are sliced through easily with a disc cutter or big pliers even. At first I wasn't in agreement that she should park her e-bike there, as it's a thief heavy area. Thugs driving around in vans looking which bikes to nick, police won't do anything. But I agreed anyway because she insisted on it and she wants to use her e-bike, which I understand.

So to prevent theft of the new bike and to make a compromise , I asked her kindly to remove the battery and take it with her inside the school. As to lessen the attraction for thieves. She won't. It's too heavy, too much of a hassle to take it out she says. She doesn't want to lug it around, even though you can just put it on the floor of the dancing school. 

I don't get it. Is it too much to ask? I'm traumatized for losing my e-bike to a rotten thief, and I just want to protect US (not her, us, because when her new bike gets stolen I would be upset too).

1nwerkn,[ Removed by moderator ],"Here's the situation, the last few years my wife and I have hosted my In-laws for the holidays (father in law and his wife, my wife’s mother is deceased). They usually stay with us for a few days in our guest room over Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, etc.

We get along fine but they are very difficult people to deal with sometimes. They pretty much just sit on the couch the whole time on their phones while we cook, clean, serve, etc. They LOVE to complain about everything (politics, the food, etc), and aren’t really interested in going out of the house to do activities.

We have a 2 year old daughter, whom they love but don’t really help with all that much either. So with our daughter become more active, hosting the holidays has become more difficult to the point where we don’t even enjoy Christmas anymore.

We have decided this year that we’re over it and don’t want to host them anymore (at least for this year). Further adding to things is that my wife will be 4 months pregnant with our 2nd by Christmas. We have been transitioning the guest room to our daughter’s room, so even if they did come, they would have to get a hotel.

Normally we wouldn’t give much thought to this decision, but my father in law has been dealing with some pretty serious health issues, and it’s possible he may not even feel healthy enough to make the 5 hour drive to our house.

Recently, she borrowed it off my desk for the weekend and when she returned it to me, something had happened to where it wouldn’t attach to my desk anymore, even though it was working just fine prior to her borrowing it.

I wasn’t mad, but I asked her what happened.  She said she didn’t know, but when I did a quick spot check, I saw that the part of the clamp was damaged. I told her that and she didn’t apologize, she just emphasized that she had no idea what happened, and that it was already on its last leg (it wasn’t).

Initially, she offered to buy me another one, and I agreed. About two weeks later, she hadn’t done that, but instead, she bought herself her own microphone clamp for her desk.

She got mad and passive aggressively apologized. I ended the conversation and went out to just go buy another microphone clamp for my desk.

1nvmrya,AITA if I tell my husband I don’t want him going to places I’m not welcome for the holidays?,"My (33F) husband (35M) have been married for almost 9 years. We have four children, all under the age of 12. For most of our relationship the family I married into doesn’t respect me, my marriage or us as parents and the decisions we make as parents. Recently, my husband and I have set up some boundaries and it honestly hasn’t helped because they try and walk right through them. I told my husband I will no longer sit at a table that disrespects us and disrespects me around my children. We also agreed that our kids wouldn’t be visiting until we can discuss these problems with them. “Surprisedly” they’re all too busy to sit down and talk. Now they’re asking what the plan is for the holidays and I would not be comfortable going but I also don’t want this to be all my fault why they throw a pity party on social media. Am I the asshole for telling my husband until this is resolved that we’ll enjoy our own living room this holiday season? Or make alternative plans until accountability is taken?

1nvl8ad,[ Removed by moderator ],"It was my besties 32M birthday recently. And so for his birthday, we had some food and he wanted to get drunk . He had some beatboxes and then he said he wasn’t feeling well . He went to the bathroom and after a few minutes I went to check on him and he was lying down on the bathroom floor face up . I asked him if he’s ok and he said he’s ok , just drunk . So I went to get him water , came back and handed him water. And after he drank some , he threw up. I saw it and I instantly went to my room. Personally, I just hate seeing throw up. It grosses me out bad and the smell . So yea I went to my room to just let him do that and then check on him again after a while . 

When I went to check on him , he was in his room laying down in bed. And I was like Wth? You’re going to bed already ? And he was very upset with me because I left to my room when he was throwing up. I was confused at first like , why do I have to be there watching you throw up? And he said “well you could’ve rubbed my back and comforted me while I was throwing up”.

(Me, personally, I never really cared about anyone comforting me while I threw up . If anything , I feel bad for ppl to watch me throw up. however it is a nice thing to do for when ppl did comfort me during but I just don’t feel bad if nobody did nor do I feel like it’s necessary.)

I explained to him that , well, it wasn’t my instinct to wana stand around and pat his back while he threw up and how seeing puke grosses me out and stuff . And he started bringing up about how he comforted me when I threw up when we were younger and that I made him feel disgusting for running from the bathroom so fast and it’s his birthday, I should’ve tried at least to comfort him on his special day and it just would be a nice thing to do as a friend for his birthday. 

I started feeling frustrated because it seemed like he was making it a bigger deal than it needed to be . Thinking back now, Perhaps he was just drunk and being sensitive? I’m not sure but he was moping hard about it and pitying himself sm about it , saying that my reaction made him feel so gross about himself and stuff . Like yea I understand how it would’ve been nice to do but like I said, it wasn’t my instinct to hang around the bathroom while he pukes and rub his back and it was making me feel like I’m a bad friend to not have done so and guilt tripping me when personally , I don’t think it should’ve been a big deal to ruin the rest of the night over . 

I tried to apologize and explain a lil more but he was still being very mopey and depressed to the point that it was making the hangout awkward and uncomfortable. I started getting more frustrated about it because he was still stuck about it and we eventually went to bed.

My dad however was really adamant about him helping me with it, I declined because I wanted to do it myself and my uni is also pretty strict about academic integrity and it scared me a little. But he helped anyways

He got really angry and pissy while he was trying to help me, saying that I had 6 weeks and my assessment was shit and unfinished, he said he wouldn't go to sleep, Its common when he tries to help me with study. He said he wouldn't sleep until we finished the assessment and I started getting tired of it so during a break I submitted the unfinished assessment early, my plan was to work on it again tomorrow to finish it off. As the Uni allows resubmission of an assessment before the due date, that way my dad could go to sleep and I wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. 

I told him and he incredibly loud and angry, then he tried taking my computer away and phone away and the yelling got rlly bad that my mom who was sleeping came out and it got heated, i tried recording what was happening but they caught me and my mom got really upset about it.

1nwgdfx,[ Removed by moderator ],"I (23F) am planning on moving out of my parents’ (62F, 57M) house and to another state about a 12-hour drive away by the end of the month. I will be moving into an apartment complex with my boyfriend (21M) and his mom (late 30s-early 40sF). my dog (miniature poodle) was picked out on pet finder by me, the hefty adoption fee was paid by me, and all the papers were completed by me back in late 2023. when I adopted him it was always the intention for him to be my dog and for me to take him with me when I move out (I am fairly certain I communicated this to my family at the time in some way but not 100%, my memory is shit). I adopted him with the intention of adopting a dog that would be suitable for apartment life, and I really think he would adjust to it fine. I was intending to move out much more quickly than how it ended up happening, but that’s life I suppose. 

I am aware that my family bonded with my sweet dog a lot in the time that we’ve had him. they’ve also helped me financially support him as I have still been somewhat dependent on them in that regard while I’ve been living here. they also take part in his day-to-day care, such a feeding, walking, letting him out, and playing with him. I don’t take pleasure in breaking their hearts by ripping my dog out of their lives but he is my dog, I am incredibly attached to him, and I am ready and willing to take responsibility for caring for him. 

my dad feels he is some sort of animal empath and seems convinced that taking my dog to live in an apartment will not be good for him. I recognize he’ll have a bit less space and won’t have a fenced in yard but I will accommodate for that by taking him to dog parks and walking him regularly. we live in a pretty small house (less than 1300 sqft) anyway. but my dad thinks he has some sort of special connection to my dog due to his animal senses or whatever, and is just completely devastated and says if I take him he never wants to see him again, because he won’t be able to take it. he has since acted very erratically, slamming doors and whimpering around the house. this is incredibly frustrating for me and is making me feel like the worst person in the world. my mom has also cried over losing my dog in her life but is being the more reasonable one for once. 

yet more reasons why my dog needs to be out of this house, my parents are both quite mentally ill and their relationship is absolute garbage, no saving it, they just can’t get a divorce because my mom is financially dependent on my dad. they fight and act pretty chaotically on a semi-regular basis and being out of this house means my dog won’t be exposed to that anymore. 

anyway, that’s all the explanation I can think of rn, please someone shed some light on this for me. I am fairly vindicated but want some opinions by people who don’t know me (or my dog haha).

1nvkw1v,AITA for losing my friends dog?,"My friend and his family were leaving their house to go to California for 2 weeks and asked me to house-sit and take care of his Jack Russell terrier. The dog is 2 years old and has a major barking problem and attachment issues. The thing did not want to leave my side all day which was fine.

Then it was time to sleep. And this dog wanted to sleep in the same room as me. He would not stop barking in front of my door as I would not let him in. I don't believe in sleeping in the same room as an animal. But I could not sleep with him barking so loud. So I put him in the basement and went back to bed. But he did not stop barking and I could still hear him clearly through the vents.

So I grabbed him by the collar and took him outside. I left him in the backyard but I could still hear the dog barking from outside and I knew I would get a neighbour complaint if I left him barking there all night. So I decided I would drop the dog off at a nearby park and pick him up in the morning. 

So I got to the park. Attached him to his leash and then wrapped the leash around a tree. This worked. The next morning I got there early and he was still there and was happy to see me. I kept doing this for three days but on the third night he decided to chew through the leash and set himself free. 

And so great the dog is gone and everyone's gonna say it's my fault. I searched the park for 45 minutes but my legs got tired and I quite frankly didn't care enough to keep searching!

I didn't tell my friend who was still in California because I didn't want him to be stressed on his vacation and I didn't want to hear him yelling at me through the phone. 

I decided to just go back to my house and put this whole house sitting jack terrier situation behind me. When he got back he started calling my phone. I didn't want to pick up because the whole situation was behind me at this point and I didn't want to deal with his family and their negativity. 

He then has the nerve to come to my house the next day, pound on my door, and demand I tell him where his dog is. So I just told him I lost him at the park. He was livid. He was swearing at me and giving me a rant about how I should have told him earlier. All of that is fine, but then he demanded I give him back the $1000 he left me for doing the job, which is not okay, and wasn't gonna happen.

After him telling me to ""f myself"" multiple times and saying I'm an a-hole, he went to search the park with his family. Grant you it's already been 10 days since this happened so I'm not sure what he's gonna find. 

I acknowledge I made a mistake by not telling him sooner. But am I really an asshole for what I did? It was the dog that bit through the leash, not me. If he trained his dog better then I don't think this would have happened at all.

Two months ago she asked me for my credit card so she could to buy her some clothes she ""needed"" , ok. Then about one week later she asked me for the credit card again so she could buy her boyfriend a birthday gift, she always pays her part of my card bill, wich is fine.

But last month she took my credit card without asking me first and bought a birthday gift for her coworker, then she bought herself some accessories, then she bought her friend some medicine and all of this without even asking me. I had to confront her to find out about those things.

Her credit card got blocked about one month ago because she couldn't pay all of the bill. Last week she had to go to the doctor so me and my other sister helped her by paying a part of this bill.

And even though all of this, she was still using my credit card. It's okay that she pays her part of the bill, and it's okay that she asks for my credit card to buy her boyfriend a birthday gift. But even though all of this she is still buying her things she doesn't need and using my credit card without my permission.

So today we had a discussion because I told her to stop using my credit card without asking me first. Then she started saying that ""every time is this humiliation"", that I am the only ine in our house (we live with our parents) that has a good credit.

1nwfojj,AITA here for speaking my mind?,"I’m six months pregnant, and it’s been an emotional time. I recently had a fallout with my best friend of four years. She told me I could be open with her and that she’d listen “without judgment,” so I shared some raw, unfiltered thoughts. Not to attack her, but because I believed we had the kind of bond where we could talk honestly.
I told her the friendship felt one-sided. I’ve always included her in the most intimate parts of my life, while she kept me at a distance. She didn’t invite me to her engagement, saying, “You’re anti-social, you get nervous and anxious. I did you a favor.” I’ve introduced her to my family and friends, but she’s avoided doing the same and even misled me about meeting hers. I’ve planned things, celebrated her, and just wished for some effort in return.
I said, “I feel a friendship should be two-sided, and I don’t see that effort from you.” She responded that her way of showing care is through presence, thoughts, and words like “I love you.” When I said, “Actions mean something too,” she replied, “My words should be enough. That’s all I have to offer.”
Instead of having a conversation, she shut down completely. Her words were, “I’m shutting down. I’m walking away.” After multiple attempts to reach her, she finally said, “Not everything is about you or how you want things to play out… I feel criticized, nitpicked, and held to a standard” and “I am my own person. I will never change.”
I apologized and took full responsibility for how my words may have hurt her. I said, “These were just raw thoughts, not decisions” and “I take responsibility for how my words hurt you.” I acknowledged her pain, but she did not acknowledge mine. She told me my words were “sickening, extremely hurtful and rude” and said I made her feel like she was “walking on eggshells” and more criticized than by her own parents.
She also said it felt like I didn’t want to include her in my pregnancy. That hurt deeply. The truth is I hadn’t told anyone due to medical concerns and fear. Only my parents and in-laws knew. She was the first and only friend I told at five months, the first time I saw her during this pregnancy. Still, she said I left her out intentionally.
When I said, “I had hoped for a conversation, not an end to the friendship,” she replied, “You’re not happy because I didn’t respond the way you wanted. No matter what I do, I won’t be good enough for you.”
I feel abandoned at a time I need support most. I’ve apologized, explained, and taken responsibility. I know I am emotional, but I didn’t expect to be left for being honest. She said she is walking away so I can find people who meet “my standard of friendship.” But I never asked for perfection. Just effort, understanding, and mutual care.
I do not think I was wrong to believe that “friendship should be a two-sided effort.” And right now, I am the only one still trying.",ThrowRA_watch,0,37,0.3499999940395355,0.017535545023696683,1759438330,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nwfojj/aita_here_for_speaking_my_mind/,2025,10

1nwiyjr,[ Removed by moderator ],"Hello! I really hate to make this post, but my dad tried calling me today while I was on a call, and I couldn’t pick up. I need some advice before I try calling him back. I've been avoiding thinking about this. So I (F30) yelled at my dad (M55) the other day.

  
This feels like it's going to be too long but here it is. For some context: my daughter and I fell down the stairs when she was 3, and it caused her to need a piece of her skull removed to relieve pressure. She made a full recovery and is 6 now. In her discharge paperwork, they said she would be cleared for contact sports one full year after her accident. So recently my older sister helped me put her in soccer to get her out of the house and have her do something physical. About a week ago my dad called me and he asked me where my daughter was and I said she was at soccer. He got really mad because he had already said that he didn't want her in any sort of sport. He said ""fuck you AND your sister, I'm not talking to you until you take her out of soccer."" then he hung up. 

I’ve always had a tendency not to question my dad. When he tells me to do something, I usually just go along with it. I often find myself worrying about his feelings and even babying him at times. He has always been a yeller, and the idea of him raising his voice at me or being upset with me in any way makes me feel anxious and even a little sick. Because of that, I tend to be pretty submissive when it comes to him. SO it really came as quite the surprise to us both when I called him back to tell him ""actually YOU go fuck yourself. The doctor said she was cleared for sports, so she's gonna be in sports!"" her responded that doctors are stupid. I told him that he's the stupid one for ignoring facts and making up his own rationale. now for the part about the car I said something along the lines of ""ok so you're afraid she *might* hit her head during soccer but you're not concerned that my car is stalling and my daughter and I could possibly be in an accident because of this?"" I also literally never go anywhere without my daughter. Now he had specifically said he would fix it and I asked him right before the call twice that it was getting worse and he said ""we'll see"" he usually is the one to fix everyone's cars. Another thing is that he has said before ""what are you doing gifting your money to strangers when I can fix it for free?!"" and last thing in my favor he also said when I divorced my ex- husband that I could always depend on him and he would always step up where my husband had failed to take care of his family. 

Now, I was willing to take my car to a mehcanic if he didn't want to or couldn't fix it. I understand he's getting older and doesn't have as much energy as he usued to. but he didn't say that. He said he would fix it then kept on pushing it back. At this point the car is fixed but Idk what to say to my dad.

1nvn51g,[ Removed by moderator ],"So me (m22) and my best friend (let’s call him Dan) have known each other for about 5 years, and especially the last 2 years we got really close. We both like the same band that’s coming to our country next year, and the plan was always to go together. At least, that’s what I thought.

We never actually bought the tickets earlier because of money stuff and also us just postponing it. Recently though, Dan has gotten really close with another friend of ours, Hailey (not real name). I didn’t think much of it at first, but lately the two of them act kinda off whenever they’re together. Like, they’ll ignore the rest of us, and then when one of them isn’t around, suddenly they act like good friends again. It’s confusing.

The thing is: Dan and Hailey literally bought tickets right away for a different concert that’s happening soon. He told me before he had no money, but apparently for that concert he did. Meanwhile, every time I mention the band we planned to see, he acts like he forgot and says stuff like “idk if I can.”

I’m still cool with him, don’t get me wrong. He even sometimes randomly texts me saying he’s happy I’m his best friend and that he values our friendship. But then I don’t get why he’s acting like this all of a sudden, not only with me but also with some of our other friends.

Now I’m finally at the point where I can buy tickets, but I don’t want to just sit around and wait until he maybe decides to care again. Another friend of mine said I should just go on my own or invite someone else. I’m really considering it, but I don’t want to look like I’m ditching him.

So, would I be the asshole if I went without him (either alone or with someone else)?",Throwaway685INTV,30,25,0.8299999833106995,0.013685000960401848,1759358971,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nvn51g/wibta_for_going_to_a_concert_without_my_best/,2025,10

1nvkqbw,WIBTA? Someone is letting her job get to her head to the point of using it to bully and one-up people. I want to contact her employer.,"Title is pretty much as it sounds. I know it's not technically illegal and likely not breaking any official conduct though, but they might care if it's being used like that. 

I understand it might just be seen as ""revenge"", the some of the belittling she's been engaging it towards others stemming from it has been really crossing the line as to what one would expect from an adult, like literally and almost directly implying people are inferior for not having a ""real job"" like her.

Even if it doesn't technically violate anything, it could give the impression that she actually cares more about status than about her actual work. 

WIBTA if I sent them an anonymous tip that this is happening?",IDrinkMyOwnSemen,0,27,0.33000001311302185,0.012796208530805687,1759353182,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nvkqbw/wibta_someone_is_letting_her_job_get_to_her_head/,2025,10
1nwj98w,[ Removed by moderator ],Am I the asshole for wanting to go to a family bbq for an uncle that has been down to visit in about 5 years? It’s also my brother in laws birthday that day an they are having a party for him at 2pm an the bbq starts at noon. My partner says I’m being inconsiderate since I’ve known about his birthday. Earlier this year my grandma has also mentioned he was coming down but didn’t have an exact day yet. An just a couple days ago in the fam group chat they sent out the announcement that he was coming.

1nvnwl9,AITA For saying no to removing the default internet restrictions on the internet I have set up in the housing I am in with fellow tenants.,"Hi all,

I recently set up a new internet account in the housing I am in after the previous contract holder moved out. There are a number of tenants contributing to it to share it, and I’m the account holder, its in my name. Honestly, the way it was going, we'd of had no internet for another week or more if I hadn't stepped up to get the ball rolling.

One of the fellow tenants keeps pestering me to remove the default restrictions. Sending me pressuring texts, I do not know what they are trying to access that is getting them a blocked webpage but I can only presume. I have said they will have to use their personal devices' data to access restricted content. With my usage of the internet, I haven't bumped into any blocked pages. The other tenants are contributing to the costs, not buying control. I don’t feel comfortable removing the default restrictions, as I am liable and legally responsible for anything that happens on the connection, not the other users. They could be trying to access anything. None of the other tenants has made any complaints.

This one has argued that it’s not illegal to access that content that they are trying to access and that they’re paying for it, but I still don't feel comfortable removing the default restrictions.

AITA for saying no? How should I handle this situation without it causing tension in the house?

I'm considering letting the house agency know, even though they have no say in the internet. Just so it's on record.
