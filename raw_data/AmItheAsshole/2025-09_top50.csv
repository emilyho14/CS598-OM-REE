1n8luhn,AITA Refuse to live with a Service Dog,"I (26M) own my own home. Its 5 bedrooms and way more space than I need.  I came into the house due to a death in the family and i've had it for about 2 years.  I use 3 bedrooms, my room, my office, my video game room.  The other 2 rooms I rent out.  One roommate, I don't know very well and keeps to himself.  The other roommate is a friend from college. 

The friend from college is a diabetic.  He has a CGM and thats how he manages it.  I honestly don't know much more about his condition and don't pry as its not my business.  He recently informed me that he is getting a service dog that alerts for his diabetes. He's supposed to get the dog next week.   

I do not want to live with a dog, I don't like them.  I told him he can break his lease for a new place but he can't have the dog in my house. Until this, it has been overall smooth sailing as roommates.  He's angry with me and supposedly looking into ways to make me accept the dog. He had a good situation at my house.   He's told me I'm an asshole for basically kicking him out because he is disabled.   AITA?

1nqetwc,AITA for refusing to have my SIL service dog at my wedding,"I once put an AITA long ago and it was super helpful, so maybe this will be helpful again.¬†

I‚Äôm getting married in 5 months with my fianc√©. And we sent our invitations last week.

Context; my SIL (my husband‚Äôs brother‚Äôs wife) as a medical dog since she had brain cancer around 5 years ago. She has seizures where she feels dizzy 20 seconds beforehand and the goes unconscious for couple minutes. This happens 3-4 times a week. She has a dog who senses the seizure 1-2 minutes beforehand and it gives her the time to lay down in a safe place and warn people that a seizure is coming. The dog (Labrador) is an angel, but SIL, not so much. She is not a good person. She claims wrong facts about my fianc√© and I‚Äôs respective fields (med and biology/environnement), and screams at us when we politely call her out. We don‚Äôt like her, but we are civil because my BIL loves her.¬†

My own sister on the other hand is my favourite person on earth. She is my MOH.¬† She is very allergic to dogs. If she‚Äôs in the same room , her eyes get red and very itchy, she sneezes constantly and she has a little asthma attack. Anti-histaminic don‚Äôt work on her. She isn‚Äôt an entitled person, prefer to ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù herself than to penalize the person with the service dog. But if in the same closed room with a dog for 5 hours, she will obviously have a strong asthma attack.

Me and my fianc√© want my MOH to be comfortable in our wedding. And it‚Äôs shallow, but I want her to feel pretty in the pictures and not to have swollen red eyes. And we want our SIL to be safe, but we thought that with her husband always around her, she will have someone to lean on. We even proposed to bring a +1 to be there for her at all instants. And the venue is a 50 persons room so it‚Äôs not possible to have them separated enough and no backyard wedding in winter.

We wanted to announce those proposition face to face, but SIL cancelled our lunch together last minute and the invites needed to be sent, so we wrote her on messenger all our points and propositions. And we thought it was a good idea because it gave her the time to think and not feel pressured to answer our invites at the immediate moment (compared to a phone call or face to face)

She called me and screamed that I was ableist and an A\*\* for suggesting to remove her from her medical help, and that I want her to create a scene at our wedding and get a concussion from falling. BIL just said ‚Äúwhat she says goes‚Äù and we don‚Äôt know what he thinks. MIL is furious and start to say she won‚Äôt come to the wedding if SIL can‚Äôt bring her dog.¬†

I know I‚Äôm biased because I obviously prefer my sister, and because I myself have (food) allergies and believe allergies should be accommodated in my wedding.¬†

What should I do? AITA. Is it a A\* move of me to suggest that?¬†

1n607gu,AITA for refusing to reimburse my friend for a chair that broke under me?,"I (F25) was at a friend‚Äôs house for a game night this past weekend with a group of about 6. Everyone brought food and drinks and we were having a good time, when about halfway through the night I got up to use the bathroom. When I came back, I saw that one of the girls had moved from a chair to the side to my space on the couch. This didn‚Äôt bug me as people shuffle around in groups, so whatever. The chair was an antique wooden chair that sat a bit lower to the ground with an added back/butt cushion. When I sat down it immediately broke, sending me to the ground with the seat under me and the arm frames falling to the side.

Everyone got quiet for a second before jumping up to help me. I wasn‚Äôt hurt, just very embarrassed. For context I‚Äôm a bigger girl, about 260 pounds at 5 foot 7 inches. My friend (F27) was very gracious and nice about it when it happened, accepting my apologies and telling me not to worry. Her boyfriend (M29) said that the chair was his grandmother‚Äôs and it has fallen apart before and he was able to repair it. I was ushered back to the couch and game night continued.

Fast forward to the next morning, I received a text from my friend who let me know that the chair couldn‚Äôt be put back together, and that from her research it would cost about $250 to get a new one, but she‚Äôd let me know exactly how much when she found one. I was a bit taken aback, and responded confused, asking why I would be expected to pay for a faulty chair. She said that while yes, on occasion the frames would become unattached and cause it to fall apart, but that that‚Äôs not what happened this time. She sent me pictures of the broken chair, particularly a bent support and 2 other broken supports. She said that the chair broke under my weight and couldn‚Äôt be fixed, and since the chair was an antique from her boyfriend‚Äôs late grandmother, she wanted a new one for him.

I responded that the chair was very old and had a history of collapsing. If they were concerned about preserving it, they should‚Äôve not had it out for people to use, and $250+ for a chair I sat in for 1 second seems a bit ridiculous. At this point she seemingly got frustrated, and said that she loves me but that I‚Äôm her ‚Äúbiggest friend‚Äù and that it wouldn‚Äôt have happened to anyone else. She said: ‚ÄúIt broke from your weight plopping down all at once, not because the frame was loose. I think it‚Äôs only fair you reimburse us for the chair since you‚Äôre responsible for breaking it.‚Äù

I‚Äôm still figuring out how to respond. I don‚Äôt want to pay her for something I don‚Äôt see as being completely my fault. I also think she‚Äôs using the scenario to shame me about my weight a bit, which I find frustrating. My friends‚Äô opinions are mixed. A few are saying that I should just pay her and move on, even if it‚Äôs not exactly my fault. One thinks it is my fault and I should pay up, and a few more think she‚Äôs in the wrong for asking and I should continue to politely decline.

1na8ojr,AITA for refusing to pay for our firends now broken Iphone and sunglasses that our son broke,"
I am 28F abd my husband is 32M and our son in question is 6 months old. 

When ever someone hold them we warn them, he'lll try grab you glasses or your phone, sometimes even grabs your hair.  ( we are trying to break this habit but he is 6 months) Now I warned my husband firend 33 F let's call her Jean, came to vist and want a hold which we done mind at all. I warned her about it all saying ""ohh best taking you sunglasses off your head he'll grab them. "" Now these are Gucci sunglasses costing almost 800 pounds ( which to me is crazy amount for sunglass but each ti ther own.) , she rolled her eyes at me accessed me of hogging my own baby ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I warned her again she said its fine. 

So she stood holding him. Took her phone out wanting to take a selfy, which again i am fine with as long as its not posted ( dont want pic of him online as of yet.) He of course grabbed her sunglasses got excited as he got them waved his hands about the sunglassses went flying she screamed scarying him he paniced and flailed hiting her iPhone to the floor. I quickly took him as she was freaking out.

She says I need to buy her a whole new iphone16 and replace her sunglasses or give her the money for them which is ¬£2300.

I said ""we cant pay that as thats not even my monthly wage. Plus i am on maternity but also I dont feel like I should as you ignored my warnings"".  So called me heartless for not been more understanding of her being upset. I was more concerned with calming down my son. My husband just shrugged, telling her I did warn her.

1nhxsqd,[ Removed by moderator ],"My husband went out of the country for a business trip and returned home over the weekend. I was out of town visiting friends when he returned. His gripe was that he was left with ‚Äúno food‚Äù. For context, I do the majority of the grocery shopping (~90/10) and he does his share of other chores, etc. 

I admit, there was not a refrigerator full of fresh food because I did not go to the store that week. However, I can attest there was a freezer with several meals and a pantry with food that could‚Äôve been prepared. Perhaps not what he was hoping for, but there were some options. Also, we live in a major city with plenty of grocery stores and restaurants within walking distance. Again, not ideal after a red eye international flight, but options.

At first it wasn‚Äôt a big deal more of a joke, but when he repeatedly made jabs at me about it, I stood up for myself and now it‚Äôs a full blown argument. We are both stubborn people.

I can acknowledge that it would‚Äôve been nice if I had stocked the fridge upon his return from the trip. However, I work a full time job myself and I see it as we are both capable adults at providing food for ourselves when the other is busy.

1n6yoez,"AITA - Adult daughter lives for free with us, wants us to pay to upgrade wifi for her","We love our daughter and we have a good relationship. She had a breakup and moved home in July temporarily (6 months? 12 months?). We are more than happy to help out and she can stay as long as she needs to, but she is complaining about our wifi coverage and how it's affecting her ability to do her job remotely. She can be pretty frugal and has asked us to pay for an extender that will cover her bedroom. We said ""no way"" after laughing a little bit.

To be fair, our AT&T wifi has always been spotty at either end of our large home, so we can understand her issue. However, she's a grown woman with a good job making good money and has significant savings. Significantly ahead of where others her age are (28 - 30). My wife and I are retired empty nesters and our wifi works perfectly well for us. She has other options to connect (plenty of room in the finished basement) but doesn't like to work there due to furniture (1 room) or lack of windows (other 2 rooms).

We can afford to do whatever we want with our house but find it off-putting that she wouldn't just buy/rent the extender and be done with it. We don't charge rent, we pay for groceries (she has dietary restrictions so she does buy some of her own as well), and we cook or provide dinner 6 days a week (she cooks one dinner a week). We believe her asking/expecting us to pay for this ""since it's your house"" is over the top. Mind you, we're also paying for a family vacation (flights, hotel, rental car, attractions/park tickets, meals) in a month. We get that children get used to parents paying for everything but this one has us alternately laughing out loud and scratching our heads. She refuses to pay anything for the extender ""on principle"", and so I guess it's on principle that we're refusing.

1nn2jvb,AITA that I asked my husband if I could take a shower,"As the title says, ages have been slightly changed and some info was left out as I don't want husband to see this until I'm ready to talk about it.
 I (26F) and my husband (26M) share a baby together (6months F). There are a few things I could complain about my husband when it comes to helping me with our baby but I won't get into those as I can handle without. 
Note that this post may seem like a jab at my husband but I'm just trying ti get some non-biased opinions from people who don't know us personally, I love my husband very much.
My husband works 9 hour days, currently 6 days a week (usually 4 but his schedule has changed), each night he comes home, spends an hour (maybe 2) with our daughter, then jumps on a game. I never tell him no when playing a game as we all need down time after work. In that time, I put our child to sleep (takes 30-40 minutes), clean her toys and crawling space, wash her bottles and prepare for the night (can take upwards of an hour and a half) on top of doing cooking and cleaning every day.
Because our daughter doesn't nap long enough I can never get a shower when he's away at work. So as of currently I am showering once a week (was 3 times a week originally).
On his day off, near the end of the day after he played games for about 4-ish hours on and off, I asked him if he would mind if I took a shower. I could tell he got upset, he told his friends ""I guess we're not doing this today, maybe another day,"" his friends replied with something (I couldn't hear) and he said ""yup"" (note the tone of his voice through all of this was obviously not very happy). Once off the game he stomps away, still upset.
Now I'm waiting to go to the bathroom to shower, and I'm just wondering. AITA for asking to shower?

1nc3qqg,WIBTA If I Cancelled My Daughter‚Äôs Wedding?,"Our daughter got engaged a few months ago.  We‚Äôre very happy for her and we think her fianc√© is a great guy!  

They told us the happy news and advised that they wanted to have two weddings - one here in So Cal, (where our daughter grew up and most of her family is), and one in OH, (where they currently live and where her fianc√©‚Äôs family and friends are).  The two wedding plan was done primarily since both have elderly relatives who no longer travel.

We were fine with this plan, and offered to pay for the So Cal wedding entirely since it obviously accommodates our friends and family.  And hosting a wedding in So Cal is much more expensive than hosting a wedding in OH.  They told us that they would pay for half of the OH wedding and that her fianc√©s parents would pay for the other half.  

We discussed potential dates and venues here in So Cal with them, and got their approval before putting down any deposits.  We all agreed that the So Cal wedding would be the legal wedding, especially since it was scheduled to take place two months before the OH wedding.

Today we were informed that they intend for the OH wedding to be the legal wedding.  My husband and I were shocked as we thought this issue had been settled.  

Now we are struggling with the issue of why we are even having a So Cal wedding if it‚Äôs basically fake and not legally binding.  It‚Äôs not even like we could turn the So Cal wedding into a celebration party as they won‚Äôt yet be married by the date of the So Cal event!  

Since this is costing us a great deal of money, we are considering just cancelling the So Cal wedding.  
We just don‚Äôt see the point in spending a lot of money for a fake wedding.

WIBTA if I cancelled the So Cal wedding and we just attended the OH wedding?  We‚Äôre honestly heartbroken, but do not want to poison our relationship with our daughter or future in-laws.  

If they had come to us originally with the plan of getting married in OH, we would‚Äôve accepted it and offered to contribute to the cost, even though it‚Äôs going to be 99% his family and friends there.

If we cancel the So Cal wedding, we will lose about 5k in deposits / sunken costs, but it would still be more palatable than 40k+ for a fake wedding.

Are we the assholes?

1numgdf,[ Removed by moderator ],"My cat Patches just turned 14 recently and was diagnosed with asthma earlier this year. I take her to the vet every few months for an antibiotic shot that seems to help her breathe better and avoid making her have to go through being on an inhaler.

Anyway, the last time I took her to the vet I had her out of the carrier in my arms. The staff was fine with this since there was no one else in the room. If a dog came in, I would put her back in and zip her up.

So, I‚Äôm waiting for the vet to come out to get us when all of a sudden the door swings open. It‚Äôs a mom and kid who is about 5. They don‚Äôt have a pet with them so I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre there to pick something up. Patches is startled but doesn‚Äôt go back to the carrier so I just continue holding and petting her. 

While the mom is at the counter talking to the receptionist, the kid looks my way and immediately shouts ‚ÄúKITTY‚Äù and starts to run over to me. That makes Patches jump back in her carrier because she doesn‚Äôt like small children because of some bad experiences when she was younger.

I‚Äôm starting to zip up the carrier when the kid tries to pet her. Without thinking, I yell out: ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT TOUCH HER!‚Äù The kid backs up and starts crying cause I yelled, but I‚Äôm more focused on zipping my cat in.

At this point, the mom turns around and STOMPS over to me fuming. How could I yell at her kid and make her cry, it‚Äôs just a cat, she‚Äôs only a child, I should just let her pet the cat. 

I tell the mom that her kid has no right to touch my cat, shouldn‚Äôt be running over to people‚Äôs pets and expecting to pet them without permission because that‚Äôs just asking to get a scratch or a bite mark, and she needs to teach her kid how to approach animals the right way, etc.

The mom doesn‚Äôt say anything back and just takes her crying kid and picks up her stuff and gives me a major stink face when leaving. I got through my appointment without any other interruptions and no one in reception really have any comments on it. 

I later told a friend about it and was told I was too harsh on the kid and shouldn‚Äôt have made them cry. That I could‚Äôve approached it more delicately. I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong because I was protecting my cat because a lot of kids don‚Äôt know how to handle and treat animals in my experience.

1nb5rou,AITA for not cleaning up sheets which have been wet by a child that‚Äôs not mine?,"My bf has a daughter (6) and we have her every other weekend. 

She‚Äôs really started testing boundaries recently and defying us, mainly me, and being generally disrespectful. It‚Äôs meant we‚Äôve had a really hard weekend with her and we‚Äôve had to work hard on keeping up with her attitude and behaviour around the house as we all share it and she needs to learn she doesn‚Äôt own it and that there are consequences to disrespect. 

She‚Äôs left tonight and I‚Äôve been at work all day. Just nipped upstairs and figured I would close her bedroom door coz she‚Äôs away and we will start tidy up and washing everything later in the week. 
When I leant in to grab the door I was met with the most disgusting smell, upon further inspection she‚Äôs wet the bed. 

I also know that her wetting the bed and not telling us is another issue in and of itself so we will deal with that in our own way. 

Now I‚Äôve not had kids of my own and even though that is definitely on the cards, I am a long way off it. I‚Äôve made it clear to my boyfriend that there are things I will not do as I am not equipped to deal with them. And for me, cleaning this up and sorting it falls within that remit. 

He asked me to clean it, as he is gaming. I said no, and tried to explain but he cut me off and made it into a huge argument. 

I understand that I live here too but I have made it clear that I will not deal with bodily functions or fluids of any kind when it comes to her. I‚Äôm still at that point in my life where I see kids as a little gross and even though I‚Äôve made steps, it‚Äôs not enough for this.

1nffps4,AITA for making kid ‚Äòcry‚Äô at a bday party,"A little context: It was MY child‚Äôs birthday party, she turned 7. We invited 10 girls, all in the 7-8y age range. Next to the obvious snacks, sweets, play activities I decided to do a couple of games where kids could win prizes. We did 8 games -like Bingo, pin the broom etc.- and had 8 prizes. It was a drop off but parents were welcome to stay if they wanted. One girl -whose parent wasn‚Äôt there- was having a hard time every time she lost/didn‚Äôt win. I comforted her, all the girls did and my daughter even gave her a little toy of hers to keep. Overall, it was a fun party.

The next day I talked to the girl‚Äôs mom -who is a close friend of mine- and asked her if her daughter had a good time and if she was okay, mentioning that she had a couple of meltdowns. The mom asked me if there was a prize for every girl and I said no, just 8, for every win. But of course there were party favors at the end of the party.

The mom was a little upset but nothing too bad and I thought that was that. Then -after I cancelled a playdate- she texted me that I have made her kid upset/cry twice this week. Needless to say, she was having feelings about it. I met up with her and told her that I‚Äôm not responsible for her child‚Äôs reaction or feelings.

I assigned homework for Thursday night into Friday to take notes. On the day of, when I'm checking homework, a student tells me he lost the paper but seemed to still want the credit. Apparently, he had taken it out to let someone else take a picture of it (cheating, didn't name the student though, but whatever) and he said he folded it and put it back into his backpack and somehow he lost it.

I ended up giving him an F. I'm very big on responsibility, because in real life there aren't any second chances if you mess up.

She said she saw a post on Facebook that I had adopted her kitten and tracked me down on Instagram to find my phone number on my business‚Äôs account. She explained that she moved out of her parents‚Äô house where the kitten lived and that she had to wait for her new landlord to tell her if she can have a kitten or not. She said the kitten kept trying to find her and one morning the kitten went outside to find and wasn‚Äôt seen again. She asked me if she can have her kitten back, she will even pay for her because she‚Äôs been looking for her for a month and sent me photos to prove it is hers.

It‚Äôs always a struggle for him, and I know he‚Äôs tired after working all day too, but I really need to be able keep them out so they‚Äôre safe and I can get it done. He usually asks for help, when one is fussing or he has to go to the bathroom or whatever. Tonight, I was in the middle of cooking, hands dirty, stove and oven on, and he asked if I could help change one of the kids while he held the other cause he was being fussy. I told him no, that I do this all day by myself AND work, and all I need is 20 minutes to cook for everyone. He got really upset at this saying that‚Äôs not fair cause I am home now and I can stop for 5 minutes to help. I finally caved and helped but I feel like it‚Äôs not that much to ask for 20-30 minutes to cook. 

I want to add that any other time we‚Äôre both home we work together letting each other have breaks, time to relax, and both help play and take care of them, the care is very evenly split when we‚Äôre both home.

My fiance (M30) and I (F34) have been dating for 3 years and engaged since October, 2024. We hardly ever fight, we live together and have a very solid relationship. My fiance has a best friend whom he doesn't see that often because he lives an hour away, let's call him Jack. Jack is a very reserved person and he is very sweet and he hasn't dated since my fiance and him graduated from college, so for the longest time he hasn't had a serious relationship. He met a girl via dating apps a while back and they started hitting it off. My fiance and I were very happy for him to finally date someone that he likes but this girl, lets call her Milly, is a recovering alcoholic. Milly had been in a very bad situation from a previous relationship where they were enabling each other. My fiance and I were a little worried about Jack dating Milly, since she had recently broken up with her ex. Fiance and I also thought it was good that Jack doesn't drink alcohol, he never liked it. So far, Jack has been very supportive to the point of helping her find a job after she left rehab.
The four of us went on a couple of double dates and in both cases I ended up ordering alcohol (wine) to go with my meal. Fiance was apalled I ordered alcohol. After the second double date Jack, asked my fiance in private to please not order alcohol when we go out next time. This made me feel upset, I feel like this is something I do not want to stop doing for someone else. I do enjoy grabbing a glass of wine with my food if we are going out to a nice place. I tried to compromise and said we could do breakfast instead or go to places where alcohol is not served. If Jack feels like Milly cannot be around alcohol I understand that, she has an addiction and I can only imagine how difficult it is to live in a world where things are constantly available, but I also feel like he is overstepping in telling me what I can order or not. I asked my fiance, what is going to happen when there is a gathering at our house and alcohol is served? Or when we plan our wedding? What is Jack going to do then? My fiance got upset because he says I am being stubborn and I don't want to be empathetic towards his best friend's girl. He basically thinks I am being and ass for not caring about his friend's feeling. I said fine, I will not order alcohol next time but made sure to let him know I am upset that someone else is controlling what I eat or drink. I believe that Jack won't be able to shelter Milly by controlling what other people do. Reddit, please tell me, AITA?

My son (23M) and his girlfriend (22F) are temporarily staying with us until their condo is ready. Their bathroom sink downstairs is small with no counterspace, so when the girlfriend wanted to dye her hair, I told her to use my daughter‚Äôs bathroom (as she has a double sink with countertops) without checking with my daughter, who was home in her room.

About an hour later, I overheard my son telling his girlfriend he didn‚Äôt know how to break something to his sister. He finally told me his girlfriend had accidentally knocked over my daughter‚Äôs pills and some fell into the sink where she was dying her hair. I said I‚Äôd talk to my daughter, but my son insisted. I heard him enter her room with an attitude, saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start acting like an ass, but \[girlfriend\] knocked your pills into the sink.‚Äù

My daughter was furious, grabbed the remaining pills, and stormed off. My son blamed her for leaving the lid loose. When she asked why they were even in her bathroom, I explained, and she got angrier, saying they could have used theirs or mine. I told her I hadn‚Äôt expected this and she needed to calm down. She called my son an asshole and shut herself in her room.

I urged my son and his girlfriend to apologize, her because she should have asked to move the pills, and him because he escalated the situation. He eventually cooled down and apologized, but his girlfriend refused. My son then demanded my daughter apologize to his girlfriend. My daughter refused, saying she had nothing to be sorry for. The girlfriend chose to stay elsewhere until their condo is ready. My daughter spoke with her psychiatrist and replaced her medication.

My son still insists I should make my daughter apologize. I did tell my daughter she could have reacted more calmly, but she maintains that they should have asked her to move the pills or at least approached her without assuming she‚Äôd ‚Äúgo crazy.‚Äù She also points out she never said anything to the girlfriend, only her brother, and that I never should have let them use her bathroom in the first place.

1nldkv7,[ Removed by moderator ],"So, my (F23) boyfriend (M25), we can call him David, has about five guy friends. I like all of them and we‚Äôve been on good terms for years. About once a month I tell my boyfriend to invite them over for dinner. Usually I cook, clean the table and do the dishes. It‚Äôs a labour of love and I enjoy doing it. This tradition has been going on for years. Most of them put away their dishes in the dishwasher but I do the bulk of the work.

Now, David (BF) is closest with Mark (M25). About a month ago Mark broke up with his GF and he has been hanging out at our place almost everyday. We all work from home so he just shows up in the morning. I don‚Äôt mind this either, David asked me if it was alright. 

What I mind is that Mark is a freaking slob. Multiple coffee mugs all over the house, water cups, crumbs on the counter, dirty dishes. Even his dirty socks once.. I made several comments to Mark that this is not dinner night and he if he is going to be over so much, he is not going to be treated as a guest and he needs to learn to clean after himself. He only rolled his eyes at me. I told David two weeks ago that Mark needs to learn to pick after himself. They had a talk and Mark did make an effort for a few days but we are back at square one.

David saw me getting frustrated so now Mark comes over once a week and David is quick to clean up after him.

It still bugs me the wrong way so yesterday when I felt like having people over for dinner I invited everyone but Mark. David did not ask why, maybe he figured it out, idk. Mark came to pick something today and asked me why he wasn‚Äôt invited and I told him. He was surprised and called me petty, and said that it was unfair to be singled out over a dirty mug. I told him that unless he changes I am not cooking for him. He is welcome to come over and have David wait on him but not me.

I don‚Äôt know if it is important but the house is David‚Äôs, but we live together.

He got upset, called me an a-hole and left. Did I overreact? I can‚Äôt tell at this point.

1n64krd,AITA for telling my sister she can't play with my girlfriends wigs?,"Okay so, context. I, (26M) have been with my girlfriend who i'll call Maddy (also 26F) for five years now. I also have a sister who's still in high school (16). Whilst we have a huge age gap I love my sister. I'm afraid I spoiled her a bit growing up but yeah i'm her big bro, that‚Äôs pretty normal.

Anyway, Maddy found out in 2023 that she has alopecia universalis. Her hair started falling out pretty dramatically since she had long hair, and she was really embarrassed. I know some assholes care about the vain stuff like that but I don't, i‚Äôm not a saint just a normal guy, but I saw it embarrassed her so in the autumn we both buzzed our hair together. Pretty soon after she started buying some normal and real hair wigs to test them out, and loved them. They are not cheap by any means but she feels confident with them so it doesn't matter to me. Maddy has met my sister, who i'll call Helena, a lot. She always wants Maddy to either take it off and show her head or give it to her. She even tugged at it once (it's glued on so didn't budge) and was mad it didn't come off. I got mad but Maddy laughed it off, not wanting to cause a scene.

We saved up and went away to this nice hotel on a Greek island, and got my sister to 'flat-sit' when we were on holiday for some extra cash. Half-way through the trip I got tiktoks of my sisters and her friends in OUR ROOM wearing some of her wigs and lip-syncing some audio off of dance moms. I was pissed, admittedly first because they were in our locked room, but then because of the wigs. I saw they cut one of the very expensive blonde wigs into a short pixie. I showed Maddy, she seemed shocked but brushed it off, saying it was fine and she'll get more. I texted her to stop, and if I catch her doing it again she'll pay for a new one. She ‚Äòapologised‚Äô, said they were just having fun but they'll stop.

Nothing else happened so we forgot about it until we got back. We reached our room, she opened the cupboard to where she keeps her wigs and they were haphazardly shoved in, cut, and some of them dyed. I was shocked. One of her wigs had been badly bleached, then dyed pink and was practically hay. I was beyond pissed off. I was beyond furious. I immediately call her, and she doesn't answer, so I call our mom. I tell her what Helena did, chewing her out. Telling her she was disrespectful to Maddy and she needs to learn how to respect other people. Mom was shocked because she knows how expensive they are, but also said she's just a kid and doesn't know better. Then offered to pay. I said I would only be satisfied if Helena payed Maddy back. She told me I was being dramatic and told me to 'cool down'.

Maddy heard this and told me not to worry. It's just material and she was upset but knows my sister didn't mean it. I swear she's an angel.

1nlasrp,[ Removed by moderator ],"Tiny bit of background: I am physically disabled. I walk with a slight limp, use crutches and braces many days, have some substantial scars (although often covered by my clothes), etc. Most days a stranger could see that I am different, but may not really know what is so different about me. 

A couple semesters ago I was taking a required class in college and discovered it was basically Woodshop class‚Ä¶ which is not easy when I am using crutches and such. I got to know the professor pretty well and he was amazingly accommodating and ended up making a lot of changes to the shop to accommodate me. 

He reached out to me a while ago and explained that he was teaching a class that focused on designing for clients and wondered if I was willing to come in and speak about my experiences being disabled and then serve as the client. I am a huge fan of advocating through sharing stories so I agreed pretty quickly. 

I went in, and spoke about my day-to-day experiences. The tiny bits of inaccessibility on campus that add up for me, the way I‚Äôm treated by others, etc. I was focusing on how my disability affects my life rather than what my disabilities are, so, notably, I didn‚Äôt give my diagnoses. Then I met with each group of students and talked about what they could design to help me. The point was for them to notice a challenge and offer a solution.

I was meeting with one group and one of the students asked me what my diagnosis was.

1ndu7zz,AITA for telling my brother he can‚Äôt bring his dog on our family weekend away?,"I'm 39M and I'm starting to think I have started a family argument over what I thought was a simple request.

My brother (37) is obsessed with his Labrador, but I told him his lab can't come on a weekend getaway 

Now my brother is threatening to skip the trip and the family is divided. AITA?

My wife and I had planned an anniversary treat for my parents as they were celebrating their 50th. We booked a country house that could accommodate me, my wife, 2 kids, parents, brother, his wife and kid.

We also booked a private chef for one night.

The house has a no pets rule. The chef also needs to be free of pets whilst setting up and cooking. I thought this would be fine by everyone.

My bro has always been glued to his lab taking her everywhere. When I told my brother about the rules he got upset and said his lab was like a daughter so should be there. To try and accommodate her he suggested leaving the dog in the car whilst the chef was there and said no one would ever find out.

I tried to shut this down by saying it was against the rules and I don't want his dog barking or running loose whilst we are trying to relax with the kids. My youngest is also a bit fearful of dogs and pet hair can be a bit of a trigger for their asthma.

Things got a bit heated and my brother said he'd bring the dog anyway

I lost it a bit and said if you can't do this for a special occasion then maybe you should stay home.

He stormed off, and he‚Äôs now told our parents he‚Äôs not coming unless the dogs allowed. Mom says I‚Äôm being too harsh and should ‚Äúwork it out‚Äù with the house owner and make arrangements with the chef. Dad thinks he's being a bit of a brat and it‚Äôs my call since I‚Äôm paying for it.

I feel bad because me and my bro usually get along great, and I want him there for Mom and Dad. I even offered to cover a dog sitter or a kennels for the weekend, but he called that ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù and said the dog isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust a pet.‚Äù

It is not a glamorous job but it's super chill and honestly, I kind of love it. I'm saving money for school, I get along with my coworkers, it's honest work. I guess my family likes to tease me about it sometimes, but whatever.  
  
My older sister (25F) got married over the weekend. During her reception speech, she did this whole thing thanking everyone. Then she looks at me and says, ""And thanks to (my name) for leaving the dishes behind to bless us with his presence.""  
  
Everyone laughed ... I didn't. I was mortified; it was so embarrassing and I chould tell everyone was looking at me, especially all of her friends and my whole extended, loud family. I have been insecure enough about not having a ""real"" job yet compared to my cousins, etc.   
  
I tried to brush it off, but my parents kept teasing me about it at dinner. I don't know, it just felt like the whole wedding was ruined for me. After about 30 minutes, I quietly got up and left and went home. I did not make a scene or a fuss.  
  
  
Now my sister is upset, saying I ""ruined her wedding by storming off early and that it was just a joke. My parents are upset as well, saying I embarrassed her by being ""sensitive."" But my friends are saying she was out of line and I was absolutely in the right to get angry.

1nb58ju,AITA for kicking my husband and MIL out?,"I gave birth two months ago, and my MIL flew in from England to ‚Äúhelp.‚Äù I never asked her to, she bought the tickets before asking, so I felt forced to agree. She has been helpful with making dinner but refuses to help with the baby at night or pick up around the house, which is what I really need help with. I end up cleaning up after her because she cooks but refuses to do the dishes, and constantly complains every time I turn on the garbage disposal. For two weeks, it‚Äôs been nonstop complaints about America: the food, the people being ‚Äúfake,‚Äù the weather, etc. At first I ignored it, but lately her comments have turned personal.

Example: after she got her hair done a few days ago, I told her she looked amazing. She rolled her eyes and said, ‚ÄúAmazing? Really? Why is everyone here so fake? Even my own mum didn‚Äôt say that on my wedding day.‚Äù

Another time, I praised the roast dinner she made (after skipping lunch because of baby cluster feeding). I said, ‚ÄúOh my god, this is so good,‚Äù and she and my husband looked at each other and laughed, then made comments about how ‚Äúumm yeah it‚Äôs good, but who reacts like that to food?‚Äù I kept my irritation to myself and stayed quiet. I went to bed right after and didn‚Äôt even talk to both of them, they were up for hours drinking wine and watching a movie while my daughter kept waking up every hour to feed, and they refused to turn the tv down so I could sleep in between feeding. 

But this morning was the breaking point. While breastfeeding, I told my baby (as I always do) that she‚Äôs beautiful, amazing, and loved, and she‚Äôll have so much fun when she starts running, describing her facial features and how they‚Äôre so pretty. MIL overheard and said, ‚ÄúOh no, you‚Äôre not turning that poor girl into a fake bimbo too, are you?‚Äù

That made me see red. I told her she‚Äôs been mocking and disrespecting me in my own home, and she‚Äôs not welcome anymore. I told her to go to a hotel because I don‚Äôt want that negativity around my daughter.

My husband blew up, said I‚Äôm ‚Äúhormonal,‚Äù ungrateful, and overreacting. He said his mom isn‚Äôt leaving and that I should be thankful for her help (help I never asked for and she doesn‚Äôt give anyway). I told him he could leave with her. It escalated, and I had my uncle come handle it because I didn‚Äôt want them near me. The house that we live in was inherited from my parents when they passed, so it hurt even more that they‚Äôre disrespecting me in MY home, my safe space. 

They go out to eat together but tell me not to come because ‚Äúthe baby doesn‚Äôt have an immune system yet.‚Äù When I walk into a room, they look at each other and laugh but won‚Äôt say why.

Now my husband has me blocked, idk where we‚Äôre gonna go from here. 

AITA for kicking them out? Did I overreact?

1n9dh9i,AITA telling my family my sister couldn't work with me because of them?,"I (28F), run my own business as a seamstress selling clothes I've made as well as doing alterations.  I've been open for two years, and I do a steady business and my primary income from my business is the alterations I do.  I have a sister (29F), who we'll call Lana.  Lana is currently a recovering alcoholic and I'm trying my best to support her.  Due to DUIs, she has been struggling to find a job and her mental health isn't helping her keep any job she finds.  I feel really bad for her and while we were visiting my parents on Monday, I made the offer she could work for me.  When I made the offer, I said that she could work inventory and register like a normal employee.  She seemed pretty on board but said she would have to think about it since she didn't want to leech off me.  Our parents were also really on board and encouraging and thought this would be a great opportunity for both of us.  Wednesday, my mom called me and asked if the building would now be in both Lana and I's names.  I asked her what she meant and she said since Lana is co-owner her name should be on the lease. I told her it wouldn't, because she wouldn't be co-owner. I made it clear to my mother that Lana would be like any other employee, the reason I wanted her to work with me is so if she relapsed, she wouldn't risk losing her job again since I know what's she's going through.  Mom beat around the bush trying to convince me to make Lana co-owner and I repeatedly told her no, not only for Lana's sake but also the sake of my business.  I don't think Lana would be a bad co-owner, but at this time, she's still fairly unstable and I don't want her to get stressed and fully break her sobriety.  I made this clear to my mother in our phone call before she eventually gave up.  I thought that was the end of it, and few hours Lana called to ask if I hired her what she would be doing, I told her the same thing I said at dinner that she would mostly be doing inventory, register, etc.  She asked if she would help with any of the clothes and I told her when she learned to sew I would consider it.  She accepted and seemed excited with the arrangement since both of us have always loved fashion and we agreed I would host an interview with her at the end of next week on my day off.  My dad called me yesterday scolding me about the position I was putting Lana in and was telling me a meaner version of what my mother was saying and continuously trying to hound me to give Lana a higher position.  I was getting really frustrated and I told him that if he and mom wouldn't stop pushing, I just wouldn't hire Lana at all.  My dad called me a terrible sister before hanging up.  I called Lana and told her what happened and my words about not hiring her, she got upset with me and I apologized and told her I still wanted her to work with me, I just didn't want to drama with mom and dad.  She understood but is still upset with me I would even say that even in the heat of the moment.

I kind of laughed it off and said, that‚Äôs what I do all week  you can book a session with me if you want though!‚Äù

I told them it does cost me time, energy, and the skills I spent years training for. If I start giving away free massages every time someone in the family feels sore, I‚Äôd basically be working for free half the time.

They got kind of grumpy about it and said I was being stingy, that it‚Äôs just a massage and I ‚Äúshould want to help family.‚Äù

The night she had the stroke, she fell out of bed.  My stepdad couldn't get her off the floor so he called my 43 year old brother from the backyard camper where he lives and the two of them struggled for an hour to get her back into bed.  They didn't call 911.  The next day I received a call around noon that ""something is wrong with Mom"".  I came over and realized she had probably had a stroke and got her to the hospital.  She had a massive stroke and because of their negligence, and waiting 12 hours to get her help, she is now half blind and can't walk without a walker.  I spent a week with her at the hospital in ICU, doing everything possible to help her.  She was discharged and went to an acute rehab for 2 weeks, and was discharged August 2nd to home.  My mother and stepdad and brother are all hoarders and their house is filthy and invested with rats.  I spent a week with a dumpster and hired help cleaning out her house so she could even get in the front door with her walker or wheelchair.  I organized the GoFundMe, cleaned the filthy house, hired the exterminator, assembled all of her medical equipment, and basically wore myself to the bone to make her home safe for her so she could come home.  My brother has done nothing to help and has left her alone in the house for hours knowing full well she needs 24/7 care.  She has fallen twice on his ""watch"". She is back in the hospital due to another suspected stroke.  I have told my family I am not picking her up from the hospital.

1nn7br5,"AITA for ""using my disablity to control my group""?","So I(20F) have a brain condition, joint disorder and several other medical issues. The main thing in this story is that my brain condition causes migranes, vertigo episodes, etc. 

I've had the same group of friends since middle school. There's 6 of us, all within the ages of 19-23. And we are all diverce in intrests, styles, etc. One of my friends, D, loves punk concerts. She posts flyers for local house concerts. Now I can't go to house concerts(most aren't wheelchair accessible, they are too loud even with noise canceling headphones, etc) so I always tell everyone to go have fun. It isn't their fault I'm disabled üíÄ and I'm not the type to be like ""If I can't go, NO ONE can"". 

There's another girl in the group, W, who tries to be like, my advocater and says, ""Oh maybe we should choose something OP can do"" to which I say again, I do not mind. At all. Hell, I love sitting at home. I got my dogs, videos games and I'm good, plus they get me extra merch from the shows which is cool af.  I never asked W to be my advocate.

Now, like 2 days ago, D posted another concert thing in our group chat. W again said, ""That isn't very accessible, we shouldn't go."" 

D BLEW tf up saying how ""W and OP are always trying to control the group and just because youin a wheelchair doesn't mean you get to dictate what the group was doing and how OP must be pming W to stand up for me all the time"". To which, I haven't. Ngl, I'm not close with W. She's one of our other friend's close friends so she's always at our hangouts. 2 other people kinda agreed with D that W shouldn't be commenting on if something is wheelchair accessible all the time. 

I said that I don't care if they go to the concerts, It isn't my thing anyway and I won't feel left out. I'm good and D tried to say I was probably trying to find a way out of them being pissed off at me and D has pretty much went silent within the group chat which is weird since we've talked everyday in it since sophomore year of high school. 

Idk, AITA?

1ndpjjo,"AITA I made my sculpture ""wrong"" so I walked out of class.","I'm primarily a textile artist. I'm technically getting a degree in sculpture, but only because my university merged the degree programs, I already hold a degree in ceramic sculpture and have been teaching on and off for the past six years. My instructor for this class is a grad student, the class is teaching wood and metalworking. Hopefully this is enough context? I am also trans and autistic.

Our first assignment is to make a reliquary for an object out of wood. That's the entire prompt, no constraints given other than it must be made out of the provided (compressed sawdust) wood panel. Since this isn't my first rodeo, I'm pushing myself to test the boundaries of sculpture and how I and the viewer interact with it. My immediate thought was creating a sculpture with the intent on burning it and the object it holds. A phoenix works perfectly. I knew I couldn't burn it in class, but I was given the okay to present it, then record the burning and upload it onto our class discussion board. 

I created the prototype over the weekend out of cardboard. Because the wood could not be carved, I was going to layer pieces in a similar way to the cardboard and have the wings attached by hinges. The phoenix would hold my old passport in it's beak. Burning the sculpture represents me leaving my old life behind in multiple ways: through me being trans, attempting to move countries, and my artistic voice changing and developing. 

I present my prototype, get good feedback, and get to work sketching onto the wooden panel. My instructor then comes up and implies I am doing the assignment incorrectly and will get a lowered grade. He questioned why it wasn't 3D (it is, the wood is layered), why a passport instead of something from my childhood, and where the baby was???? Like how would I have a new one come out of the ashes... The phoenix is representative of my old self, I am the new. I don't understand how he couldn't see this, we spent a good five minutes on just that point.

He finally leaves me so I can continue my work, but most of the class is over at that point. Jump to today, I'm finalizing my sketch and marking cuts. He comes back and starts questioning again why it's a relief and not a sculpture (a relief IS a sculpture) and, at this point, I'm frustrated and done answering questions. Again, we were not given any constraints or instructions other than ""reliquary."" I defend my work again and then we just.... stare at each other. He wouldn't leave so I gathered my stuff and left the class, dropping it a few minutes after. 

I'm probably in the wrong, but this isn't my first time making a sculpture. I know what I want to say and I don't want to compromise that by changing things simply for a grade. I'm planning on transferring to a weaving specific school anyways, so it's not like this will ruin my degree, either. Maybe it's an autistic misunderstanding, but if you wanted me to make a specific sculpture, then tell me that or let me use different materials.",FrostyFreeze_,2148,534,0.8600000143051147,0.18281910394756642,1757536520,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ndpjjo/aita_i_made_my_sculpture_wrong_so_i_walked_out_of/,2025,9

When we were dating, he had always expressed his dream of starting his own business and he is an entrepreneur at heart. At age 27, he quit his well-paying job to start his own business -- a fitness studio.¬†

I find it risky and scary, but supported him nonetheless because it‚Äôs his dream. We could also afford starting a business because I make 130k and have an inheritance from my mother who passed away.

Besides monetary support, I also helped with renovation, building equipment, contacting clients, and advertising. I manned the front desk from time to time.

Three years later, his business had lost 200k, which I paid for entirely using my inheritance. All the money he made from the business stayed in the business to pay for expenses, so I also paid 100% of our housing, transportation, food, and entertainment.

My resentment was growing, and I was tired of being the sole provider. I feel he made many wasteful purchases, such as very expensive marketing services that brought in nearly no revenue.

From my husband‚Äôs point of view, he was working hard every day for our future. Despite the loss, he was making calculated bets. He believes that ‚Äúscared money don‚Äôt make money‚Äù. There‚Äôs no need for me to stress because ‚Äúwe are not hurting for money,‚Äù given my income and inheritance.

He finds his business a tremendous source of pride and joy, seeing many clients who love the gym and continue to come back. He made friends with his coaches and clients. The gym is his sanctuary.

Five months ago, we agreed that I will no longer chip in anymore for the business. He would find a job so that he can start contributing to the family, and he will use his income to support his business.

Fast forward to today, he hasn‚Äôt found a job yet. He also maxed out the business credit card and now the business is 40k in debt. I was furious.

Her court day is approaching and as far as I know, she still doesn't have legal representation, and B) tarot cards might give a ""it's fine!"" answer but a judge and jury in Massachusetts are going to decide on their own. I told her no, she should really find a lawyer. Grace got really upset, saying this would help her know what to expect and put her mind at ease, and that I wasn't being a good friend. 

I think a good friend sometimes has to give their friends hard truths, but tarot doesn't always take long, and it could make her feel better. AITA? 

EDIT- I just got like, 7 inbox requests for tarot readings. I'm not doing that. Also, to answer some questions, I use tarot as a soothing tool, an advice tool, and yes, for fun. I find it helps me think things through more. It's more than a party game to me but it's not life and death.

1n8ow1d,AITA for refusing to Venmo my roommate‚Äôs mom for cooking us dinner?," 
I  live with three other guys in an off-campus apartment. Last weekend, one of my roommate‚Äôs moms came over and cooked this big homemade dinner for all of us. I thought it was really nice of her, I helped set the table, washed the dishes afterward, and even grabbed some drinks for everyone.

The next day, my roommate texted in the group chat saying: ‚ÄúHey, my mom spent like \$80 on groceries for last night‚Äôs dinner. Can everyone Venmo her \$20 to help cover it?‚Äù

I was honestly confused. None of us were told in advance that we‚Äôd be expected to chip in. Whenever my parents visit, they bring food or cook for everyone, and it‚Äôs always just a gesture ,not something they charge for. I told him I appreciated his mom cooking, but I didn‚Äôt think it was fair to be asked to pay afterward without knowing.

Now he‚Äôs upset and says I‚Äôm ungrateful and disrespectful, and the other two roommates already Venmoed her without complaint. So now I look like the only cheapskate.

From my perspective, it feels wrong to turn a mom‚Äôs dinner into a bill. But maybe I‚Äôm missing something and I actually am being stingy.",MiniPataka,1659,467,0.949999988079071,0.149269330797406,1757026628,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1n8ow1d/aita_for_refusing_to_venmo_my_roommates_mom_for/,2025,9
1nqhhuf,[ Removed by moderator ],"My wife is obsessed with Stanley cups. She owns at least two dozen, probably more. She uses three cups a day. Her morning coffee goes in one, a flavored water goes in the second, and then a third goes with her to work empty so she can put whatever else she wants in there that day. For the last couple of years, I've put up with it. We've been married 9 years and the only assigned chores are that I do the lawn care and the garbage (smell of garbage can make her vomit). We equally cook and clean and do laundry and anything else that needs to be done whenever we see it needs to be done. 

Chores have never been a point of contention until March of this year. I took a lateral position that changed my work style significantly. I now work from home four days a week with the fifth being a half day split between two offices. I'm home by 3:00 on those days. So because of that, I've taken on way more of the chores. I'm not complaining about most of it because I can do it and my life is much easier than it was before. The problem is my wife's habits. Because her office is so remote, lunch options are limited, so she tends to take all the leftovers from dinner. The issue is that she will leave the dirty, unrinsed containers in her car for days at a time and then just stack them up in the sink for me to deal with. Between the insanely bad smell and filling up the bottom drawer of the dishwasher every few days with Stanleys, I'm over it. In addition to the numerous cups, she also expects the matching lid and straw to be reassembled before storage. 

  
I told her that if she wants to continue ignoring my requests to bring her containers in every day, or to at least rinse them out at work, then she has to do the dishes from now on. Now, according to her, I'm being unreasonable. Because I'm home and don't have any commute time, I have way more free time than she does, and so I should take on the majority of the chores. But from my view, I've done exactly that. Since the change, I do nearly everything. Vacuuming, mopping, cleaning/folding/storing clothes, grass, garbage, and most of the cooking. I don't think it's particularly fair to expect me to also deal with her stinky tupperware and mountain of cups along with the sorting of the accessories after.

1nkmgz3,[ Removed by moderator ],"I‚Äôll try to give pertinent background info, but condense it.

My ex-wife (51F) and I (50M) were married 18 years, right out of college. We had a good, functional and loving marriage, but in the end, she decided it wasn‚Äôt for her and we amicably divorced.  We had 2 kids, 18F and 19M.

6 months later I met my current wife (47F) and her son (19M). We‚Äôve now been married 8 years. She had a very tumultuous and abusive relationship with her ex. It‚Äôs still volatile and she hates him‚Ä¶only dealing with him when needed.

My ex and I have a great co-parenting relationship and are friends. We only talk about kid related things, except at kid related events where we make small talk. We don‚Äôt communicate much outside of that.

My current wife and ex were pleasant and professional for awhile.

Several years ago, I was venting about my ex traveling a lot for work and having to pick up extra slack a little. Mind you, this was just venting, and I honestly love any extra time I get with the kids. Well, my current wife decided to text my ex-wife, basically calling her out as a bad mom, and telling her to pick up the slack. I didn‚Äôt really feel that way and felt it was out of place for her to do that.

Since then, the ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù between current and ex wife has not been good and basically irreparable.  They‚Äôre professional, but my current wife hates my ex, with very little cause in my book. We had to sit separately for my son‚Äôs graduation 2 years ago, but sat together this year for my daughter‚Äôs graduation

When it came time to move my daughter in to college, I did not want that tension to ‚Äúruin‚Äù my daughter‚Äôs bonding moment with her mom.  College move in day can be very emotional. I asked my daughter about my wife coming to move in, and she said ‚Äúit might be too many people‚Äù. Granted, I admit that the way I asked the question was a little leading, but the tension between my ex and current wife is well known in the family.  My wife wasn‚Äôt invited to move in and my ex and I moved my daughter in‚Ä¶separate cars, and only for a few hours. We did the same thing for our son last year‚Ä¶my wife didn‚Äôt go because she was working.

My current wife was livid, and weeks later it‚Äôs still a sore spot and led to another blowup last night, somewhat related to this.

I admitted to my wife that it was a mistake and apologized.

1ntrysk,[ Removed by moderator ],"So I'll begin like this I‚Äôm Kayla and my friend Kate lives in a studio that‚Äôs pretty cramped up. Two months ago she asked if she could keep two small boxes of her winter clothes at my place since I have a two bedroom and more space. I didn‚Äôt see the harm at the time  and agreed.



But those  ‚Äútwo small boxes‚Äù turned into bags, then shoes, then coats, and what not,  She now has about 6 large bags and two bins stacked in my spare room. I told her it‚Äôs starting to overwhelm my space and making me feel uncomfortable , especially because I actually use that room for work and studying basically.



When I asked her to either pick up her stuff or pay me part of the rent I pay (like $30 monthly, which is less than a storage space), she got mad. She said I was being greedy, that ‚Äúfriends don‚Äôt charge each other for favors,‚Äù she also accused me of acting like a landlord in my own house.



From my point of view, it‚Äôs not just about money   it‚Äôs about my home. I feel like I can‚Äôt have guests over without explaining why I‚Äôm storing half her wardrobe. I‚Äôve also had to move her stuff around multiple times just to use my desk for work.



Some mutual friends are saying I‚Äôm right for setting boundaries, but others think I‚Äôm being petty and making a big deal out of something that‚Äôs been hurting me so bad.

1no0b2h,[ Removed by moderator ],"In case you don't know what spirit week is, it is a week where each day is a themed ""dress-up"" day for school. My younger sister (12), wanted to borrow my Nirvana shirt because tomorrow is ""Rapper"" day. She said she wanted to borrow my Nirvana shirt because it's ""gangsta"" and ""looks like it's from the hood"". I then educated her on how Kurt Cobain and Nirvana was not ""gangster"" and how disrespectful that was, her response being ""I don't give a fuck"" and ""just give me the shirt"". I offered an actual rap shirt (Public Enemy), but she started crying because i didn't give her the shirt and she stormed out of my room. I then got scolded by my parents for not giving my sister the shirt, and I was forced to give my shirt to her. Is it that deep, or AITA?

Mini Update: Hasn't gone to school yet, but I just found out that it isn't Rapper day. It is rhyming day, and you have to rhyme with someone elses outfit. Which means that she specifically chose to be a rapper, and then come to me not only asking for sunglasses (which I gave her) but also asking for a Nirvana shirt.

Update: She apologized to me after getting home. Apparently a group of like 3 boys in her grade kept making fun of her, and a bunch of other people made comments in the hallway passing her. She apologized for not listening to me, and she apologized for STAINING MY SHIRT WITH ICECREAM. Hopefully it comes off in the wash though. Safe to say she is never borrowing my clothes again. I think I'm pretty much done with this story, but apparently I should come to this subreddit more when my sister does crazy over-the-top things. Thank you all so much for the comments and feedback!

P.S: She rhymed with her friend who dressed as a ""Napper"".

1nsyaph,[ Removed by moderator ],"I (21F) moved back home with my parents after being diagnosed with cancer last year (in remission now). I decided to stay home to attend community college since I don‚Äôt have enough money saved to move back to university.

This month, I finally got my college refund disbursed. I was planning to use my refund to catch up on my student loans from the previous university I attended since my cancer treatment deferment was ending soon. Two days after I received my refund, I went to go check how much money I can use for my loan. I noticed that $500 from my account was missing and transferred to my mom‚Äôs bank account (I have a joint bank account with my mom since it was made when I was a minor, I didn‚Äôt mind her having access since she said it was a good idea for her to see my account for emergencies).

I was confused and woke up my mom in the middle of the night to ask her why she removed $500 from my account. She said that she removed it because she thought it was a ‚Äúfinal computation‚Äù or an extra refund from another class from my old university that my dad helped pay for (Context: I didn‚Äôt receive aid for a summer class I took last year in my previous school since I didn‚Äôt take enough units to qualify. I originally was enrolled in enough classes to qualify for aid, but had to drop them since I had to immediately get treatment for cancer). I was extremely confused because my dad let me use his card, then why would she think that a refund would go back into my bank account? Then, when I kept asking for an explanation, she said ‚ÄúI thought you would‚Äôve noticed that your money is gone because I saw that you spent $5 at this store and $20 at another store, don‚Äôt you check your money before you buy anything?‚Äù and ‚ÄúI told your dad that I removed the $500 from your account because I thought it was an extra refund from your class‚Äù. I ended up yelling at her to put the money back in my account, that she can‚Äôt just remove it without saying or clarifying anything first, and wouldn‚Äôt stop until she gave me the money back. Even then, I just kept yelling at her out of frustration since I couldn‚Äôt understand why she thought she could remove it because the bank statement says that my refund came from my community college, not from the other university I attended. I was just so mad because she spent two days relying on me finding out by just checking my phone to see how much money I had. 

The second she saw me the next morning, she started yelling at me for waking her up just for a ‚Äúsmall amount of money‚Äù and that I ‚Äúshould‚Äôve asked her nicely‚Äù for her to give my money back. I honestly don‚Äôt know how to react at this point. AITA?

Edit:

I wanted to clarify that the refund I received is the leftover grant money from community college. I did not pull out any student loans this year.

I am also considered an inactive student by my previous university since I was gone for a complete school year. I didn‚Äôt qualify to pull out a student loan or receive financial aid specifically during the summer of 2024, which was when I took the class my Dad helped pay for. My university already clarified to me that there was no extra loan or grant money was expected to be disbursed for that summer.

Every refund that I have ever received was always disbursed within the first two weeks of the same quarter. If I did receive one, I would‚Äôve received a notification that it was being disbursed and it wouldn‚Äôt have taken a year for my university to give me a refund.",rambutanorangutan,1826,290,0.9599999785423279,0.13116751665646542,1759090227,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nsyaph/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_after_she_removed_my/,2025,9
