1gg08k9,"AITA for not being friendly with my partners daughters now that they've ""warmed up"" to me","I'm (42) dating Tim (59), a widower. He's in banking, I'm a bartender. I know what it looks like. His 2 daughters thought the same thing, but he's broke as a joke and I've got a trust fund, so actually no.  
  
He's broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2^(nd) mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.  
  
His daughters live 6hrs drive away.  
  
We drove to them for Xmas last year and the year before. They ignored me, dragged Tim away when he tried to include me and prevented their husbands from making even small talk with me by talking over me.  
  
Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn't their Mum.  
Year 2, they did it again.  
  
This year I told Tim not again.  
He could go, I would never ask him not to see his daughters for Xmas but I'll stay here.  
  
Tim didn't love the idea because me going with him means we can share the responsibility of driving when his back starts to bother him. (He hates to fly)  
His 2010 deathtrap is starting to go anyway, so I leased him a comfy luxury ride (my brother has a dealership)  
  
He called the girls, super excited that he'd be able to see them more often without having to worry about his back,, who then blew up and accused him of spending their Mothers money on a “bull\*\*\*\* house and car to impress some bimbo bartender and didn't offer them a dime for their weddings”  
  
In the ensuing argument it came out that they assumed there had been a life insurance policy, nor did they have any idea about the credit card debt or the 2^(nd) mortgage that the house was underwater on or that Tim was looking at foreclosure and bankruptcy until he moved in with me.  
  
They did not realize it was my house, that he pays no bills save the water bill (man takes excessive showers) and shared groceries.  
  
Now the girls want my number. They are sorry I “felt lonely” at Xmas.

They want to come visit and stay with us next year! Conveniently in summer, I live near a beach.  
  
I've told Tim absolutely not about giving out my number. I'm happy to be polite if they come to visit Tim but, we're not going to be friends. If they had talked to me for even 2 seconds they'd have understood. I am not shy about admitting the only thing I have ever contributed to my blessed financial state is “not developing a crippling coke addiction” like my cousin Danny did.

  
Tim thinks I'm being too unforgiving. They would have warmed up to me eventually but knowing how generous I am being with their Father has made them warm up quicker.

1g1nodm,AITA for pouring my boyfriend's raw milk down the drain because I found out it's dangerous?,"So I recently found out that my boyfriend has been buying and drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk. He grew up on a farm and apparently his family always drank it straight from the cow, and he's been doing the same ever since we moved in together.

At first I didn’t think much of it (being a vegan I never drank it myself) but I started doing some research after I saw the label on it literally says ""not for human consumption"". Apparently raw milk can carry harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. I freaked out when I read that, I don't want him to get sick or expose me to something dangerous.

So, when I saw a fresh bottle of raw milk in our fridge yesterday I panicked and poured the entire bottle down the drain. I thought it was the safest thing to do.

When my boyfriend got home he immediately noticed and was pissed. He said he spent a lot of money on that milk and that he’s been drinking it for years without a problem. He accused me of not trusting him and said I had no right to throw away something he enjoys just because I disagree with it. I tried explaining that I was just concerned for his health and ours, but he said I was being a ""control freak"". Now he's barely talking to me and I feel like there’s this huge distance between us.

AITA for pouring out the milk? I thought I was doing the right thing but I'm starting to wonder if I overstepped.",gggisel,4783,7059,0.7099999785423279,0.6007413960149964,1728691072,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g1nodm/aita_for_pouring_my_boyfriends_raw_milk_down_the/,2024,10
1fvixcv,"AITA for refusing to pay my friend's share of the bill after she ""forgot"" her wallet?","A few days ago, I went out to dinner with a group of friends. We had a good time, and at the end of the meal, the bill came. One of my friends Sarah suddenly said she had forgotten her wallet at home. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened, but it’s never been with me directly she usually does this with other friends.

Everyone was pretty quiet, and I could tell they were waiting for someone to offer to cover her. I didn’t say anything at first, but when Sarah looked at me, I kind of awkwardly said, ""I cant cover you sorry"" She seemed shocked and said she would pay me back tomorrow. I still said i couldn't because I’m not comfortable covering other people's expenses, especially when this has happened before.

She got upset, saying she felt embarrassed and that I was making her look bad in front of our friends. One of our other friends ended up paying her share, but the whole mood shifted. Afterward, She also texted me later on saying I was out of line and should’ve just helped her out since it was ""only a small amount.""

Some of my friends are on her side, saying I could’ve just covered her since she promised to pay me back, while others agree that it's not my responsibility, especially since she has a history of doing this.",Creepy-Foundation423,12347,2426,0.9700000286102295,0.4318946604244663,1727991252,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fvixcv/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_friends_share_of_the/,2024,10
1fxu5wr,AITA For Ruining A Child's Life?,"Today, I started talking to an American mother while in A&E; her child was interested in the artwork I have on my leather jacket as it's pretty colourful. The mother mentioned that her daughters name was ""Grain"" so I assumed for a while that she was another mother who wanted something ""special"" to call her child. I remarked that it was a unique name and that I'd never met anyone called Grain before.
She told me that she's named after her great-grandmother and that it's an Irish name. At this point, the alarm bells are ringing in my head because I've realised that the kid is called Gráinne (generally pronounced as Gro-nyuh, or there abouts.) 
I tried to be very tactful, and I was like, ""Irish has such an interesting alphabet. How is her name spelled? Irish names can be tricky."" 
The kid is called Gráinne. Not Grain. 
My partner, who has studied Ireland's political history as part of their dissertation and also the Irish diaspora and it's culture around their university city,  is stuck somewhere between stifling a laugh and dying of embarrassment on her behalf so I come up with, what I thought was a very positive reply.
I said ""an old-school name and a more modern pronunciation. I think that's a great way to pick names."" I would like to point out that I do not like the name Grain for a child, nor do I like the way the pronunciation was butchered, but I was trying to be tactful and positive. She asked what I meant, and I said ""well in Ireland, they typically pronounce it like ""gro-nyuh"".""
Her face went red and said that I shouldn't have said that the pronunciation was wrong in front of the kid because now she's going to grow up knowing that her name is wrong and feel bad about it. I apologised for causing offence and restated that it's a lovely name in both ways and a fantastic nod to her heritage. I said that I'm sure her great-grandmother would be thrilled to be honoured by her name being used. I was throwing out just about every positive reinforcement that I could think of, but, to be frank, she was pissed off. 
She told me that I ""ruined her daughter's self-esteem"" and that her ""life [was] ruined"" by me saying that ""her existence is wrong."" I didn't say that, by the way. I said that her name was pronounced atypically. Gráinne, for context, was around 2 years old and completely unbothered by the conversation until her mother got angry at me. She was just looking at the pictures on my jacket. The conversation was maybe five minutes long, but I managed to ruin this kid's life. 
Hindsight says I should have kept my mouth shut and waited for somebody else in this city to say something. 

So, AITA?

Edit: spelling and syntax
Edit 2: Some people have assumed that we're in the USA, we're in the UK, in a city with lots of Irish people, an Irish centre, and a great Irish folk scene.

1furzzy,AITA for refusing to cook a vegetarian Thanksgiving dinner?,"I feel like I’ve slipped into the twilight zone with this whole argument, so tell me what’s up, internet folks.

Background: I (31F) and my brother Mark (35M) do not get along. When he was a teen he saw a documentary on factory farming and decided to become a vegetarian. He got very, very annoying about it quickly, but my dad shut him down when he started trying to get the rest of us to be vegetarian with him.  Then he went to college, made a bunch of very strange friends, and went militantly vegan. It’s his entire personality. I stopped talking to him after he threw a fit about one of my birthday dinners being at a steakhouse and spammed my messages and SM with pictures of abused cows.

My parents have been trying to repair the situation and for a while, it did seem like Mark was getting better so I’ve been letting him back into contact gradually. Then he started dating Pam, who is some kind of vegan influencer. She is apparently moderately popular online, but I have no idea what she does exactly. I don’t know if Mark was trying to impress her or what, but last Thanksgiving he insisted that mom cook at least a vegetarian meal or they wouldn’t come on “ethical grounds”. My mom just wanted everyone to get along on her favorite holiday, so she agreed. It was not a fun meal.

This year, my parents have downsized for retirement and my mom is having health problems. I bought their house when they moved, so my mom asked me to host Thanksgiving so it would be like usual. I told everyone in the group chat so Mark and Pam could make travel arrangements and Pam immediately started gushing about all the vegan replacement recipes she could give me to replace the traditional ones.  I said to send me a main dish recipe they like and I would give it a shot, but I’m making the traditional meal otherwise and there should still be plenty of things they can eat.  Mark and Pam have been arguing about this with me for days and then Mark said that if I wouldn’t make a meat-free meal they wouldn’t come.  This upset my mom, who asked me to just make what she made last year to keep the peace, but I told her that Mark needs to get over himself and I’m not coddling him.  I’m having turkey on Thanksgiving.

My dad privately agrees with me, but Mark threatening to not come is upsetting my mom so much that he’s worried it will impact her health. There’s a not big, but also not zero chance that these might be some of the last family holidays we have with her. My mom thinks I’m putting turkey over my own family and I’m not so sure anymore.

AITA?

Edit: Whoa, this blew up.  So the answers to some common questions:

As I said, I’ve already offered to make sure there is a main dish and sides they can eat. Mark and Pam will not show up if anyone else eats meat at this meal. If any meat is served to anyone, they won’t come.

Doing multiple meals that day or across multiple days is a no go. I’m a newly minted critical care physician at an understaffed hospital during a major holiday week and I will have a limited window of time between shifts. I have time for one gathering and I would rather not waste it on a miserable one like last year.

Mark and Pam can’t host because they live in a van at present. I’m also not willing to have them in my kitchen for hours bitching about the meat in my fridge, the cookware and utensils, and whatever else they can find to complain about. The time it would take for them to come eat, socialize for a couple of hours, and leave is the maximum amount I’m willing to let them be in my home. Although it would admittedly be interesting to watch them try to host a family Thanksgiving out of a van.

It is very unlikely that my mom is going to die anytime soon.  It’s just a non-zero chance, she’s understandably worried about it, and is in the pessimism stage of grieving her health. She has a good prognosis and most people with her condition pull through and live for a long time afterward. If it is by some chance the last Thanksgiving, I don’t think a repeat of last year’s Thanksgiving would do her any good either as everyone left that table unsatisfied and unhappy.",Suspicious-Basil7882,6761,2572,0.9399999976158142,0.3245815759488274,1727905530,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1furzzy/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_a_vegetarian/,2024,10
1ggrg1s,AITA for buying my own dinner because I don't like what the in-laws order? ,"I'd like to preface by saying that I am not a picky person. I don't just...turn down food. I'm always willing to try new things, even if they're weird or unconventional. One of my favorite things to do is to pick out something I've never tried in the grocery store.   
  
But my in-laws are hooked on this one take 'n bake pizza joint that I just cannot stand. I've tried to like it. I've ordered so many different things off of their menu. I just. Don't. Like it. They order it for every single family event. Every get together. Every holiday. Every birthday. 

I started ordering my own meals to bring to the parties. They got upset when they realized what I was doing. I explained that I LIKE ordering my own food, because it's a chance to get a treat for myself that I don't normally order. Still, they're always trying to convince my partner to get me to change my mind and just eat the same pizza as everyone else. 

This Halloween, we'd all planned to get together for a Halloween party. My partner and I had actually planned out a fun homemade meal (pasta bar) for everyone, but MIL became VERY upset that we weren't getting pizza. She put her foot down so hard that we thought there'd be an actual honest to God fight about it, so we told her she could order the take 'n bake she wanted. 

And of course, I was going to run to the store and get my own favorite pizza. She became SO angry. She insisted that I eat what she ordered, what everyone else was eating, and even offered to buy me ANYTHING that sounded good off the menu. I told her again that I don't like anything on the menu and that I'm perfectly willing to go and buy something that I do enjoy instead. 

She's still angry with me. FIL is angry with me. They tried again and again to convince me (they always do) to get something off the take 'n bake menu. 

But I just don't like it!

1g30yhm,AITA for shaming my sister for being pregnant and refusing to help her at all with any expenses ?,"AITA? I (24F) have a twin sister ""Ashley"" and we've always been close. She started dating this guy a year ago ""Jared"" (32M). I never really liked him but my sister was head over heels in love with him and said she wanted to marry him. This summer I was at the grocery store when a woman with three kids came up to me in the aisle and asked if I was Ashley. I said no and was about to say we're twins when she cut me off and said ""Yes you are. You're dating my deadbeat baby daddy and want to stalk my pages leaving hate messages saying he chose you over us and to move on. How heartless are you""? I was like WTF I am NOT Ashley,I'm her twin sister ""Blaire"" and asked if she was talking about Jared.


She said yes, and showed me the screenshots of my sister DMing her saying Jared is now hers, he doesn't claim those kids, blah blah. I was very uncomfortable but I knew in my gut he was a weirdo. I was so shocked my sister would date a deadbeat and proudly knowing how our father being a deadbeat sent us both to therapy. I just walked away. A few days later I asked my sister and she denied it at first then admitted it saying she didn't tell me he has kids since I personally don't date men with kids and she didn't want me to judge her. I told her I was judging the fact that he's a DEADBEAT, not a father. We argued about it a lot and I've looked at her differently since. 


Anyways this week she invites me over and her and Jared tell me she's pregnant and are both so happy. I just sit there silently and kept eating. She asked why I was acting like a bitch and why aren't I happy to be an aunt and I said because of and gestures towards Jared. He got mad and said ""What's your problem with me"" and I said because you're a deadbeat. They both got quiet and he said ""That doesn't mean I'll be one for this kid""...  at that point I laughed and got up to leave. I'm in the hallway on the way to the elevator when my sister comes running behind me and keeps asking why I'm being so rude while she's sobbing. I told her thatshe should be ashamed to be pregnant by a guy that abandoned his other kids knowing that happened to us and that she's disgusting and a loser and he's gonna leave her like he did did his ex. 


She said I don't know the full story and she can't believe I would be not supportive in this time of her life and the baby has half my DNA too. I felt bad and said I would try to be there for her but she'll realize what a mistake she made then I left.

1fvl31q,WIBTA for not following a dress code at a bachlorette?,"My friend is having her bachlorette in two weeks.

I am currently six months pregnant.

Tonight, a bridesmaid put on the group chat that we will all need to be in barbie pink so the bride can wear white and stand out.

Ever since I started showing I have had a nightmare with getting clothes to fit. I've tried six maternity shops but nothing has sat right on me, I think because I'm really tall the bump part of the clothes doesn't fall on where my bump is.

I've settled for having four stretchy knit dresses that I fit into. These are all dark and not pink.

I messaged the bridesmaid and said I'm going to really struggle to find an outfit in barbie pink, as almost nothing has fit me.

She said this isn't about me and if I cared about the bride I'd make it work.

1fx1yuv,AITA for Refusing to Let My Brother’s Kids Stay at My House After He Got Evicted?,"So, I (23F) just moved into a new apartment in a pretty nice area after getting a promotion at work. I worked hard for this place, and it’s the first time I’ve ever lived alone. I’m really proud of it.

Here’s where things get complicated. My older brother, “Jake” (31M), has always had a bit of a chaotic life. He’s a good guy, but he and his wife don’t really manage their money well. They’ve always been living paycheck to paycheck, and with the rising rent costs, they recently got evicted from their apartment. They have two kids, ages 4 and 6.

Jake asked me if they could stay with me temporarily until they figure things out. Now, I’m not heartless, but my apartment is a one-bedroom. I barely have enough space for myself, let alone for four other people, two of whom are little kids. Plus, I’ve never had kids around, so I don’t know the first thing about taking care of them or childproofing my place.

I offered to help them financially — I could contribute to a short-term rental for them or even let them stay in a hotel for a while. But Jake and his wife insist that staying with family would be easier and less stressful, especially for the kids.

The thing is, I’m not comfortable with the idea of having my peaceful space completely turned upside down. I don’t think it’s my responsibility to accommodate their poor planning, and it honestly feels unfair to me. But now my parents and other family members are calling me selfish and saying I’m putting my “fancy apartment” above family. They’ve been guilt-tripping me, saying things like, “Family helps family in times of need,” and “Think of your nieces!”

I love my brother and my nieces, but I’m standing firm on my decision. Now everyone’s angry at me, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m being unreasonable.

1gcwl1t,AITA for Telling My Wife Her Parents Will Die,"I (39 M) and my wife (36 F) have been together for 14 years and have what I consider a great marriage. We very rarely have arguments and in general have a pretty good life. 

My wife had a pretty good, middle class childhood, no major issues other than the typical stuff you experience as you grow up. Her parents were loving and did the best they could for her and her brother. There are no buried secrets or hidden abuses, I don't believe either my wife or her brother ever even got spanked.  Her parents are divorced but still on great terms with one another and with the family at large. They live about 1,200 miles away from us so we don't see them as often as I would like. Her parents have always been there for us and on more than a few occasions have helped us financially when we needed it. Honestly they are a somewhat boring Hallmark channel family and I cherish it. 

Shortly after getting married my father passed away and my mother passed about a year later. I was very close to both of them and the loss was terrible. I often think about every time I didn't pick up the phone to call them or would put off a visit because I'd ""do it next time"". 

My wife is really terrible about being in contact with her family, but especially her parents. She just... doesn't make an effort. I will often ask her if she has spoken to anyone and she just says ""I will later"" and then never does. Sometimes weeks go by and she won't reach out to them at all. Her mother made a comment once that she knows everyone is busy but she wished her children would reach out a little more. It drives me crazy that she just doesn't try- there is no reason. I could understand if they had been bad parents or had done something to her but that isn't the case. When I ask her why she won't do it she says she doesn't need to. 

I told her a few weeks ago that I encourage her to speak to her parents because I miss mine terribly and I really regret every missed opportunity. I just don't want her to have the same regrets. She said just doesn't feel that way and kinda moved on without saying much more. 

Her parents sent us some money to cover an unexpected medical bill and I thanked them but told my wife she really should reach out and at least say thank you. She said she would ""later"". I am embarrassed to say that I got angry and I said "" You know, they'll be dead some day and there won't be a later!"" She began crying and told me that I was cruel and should never have said something like that. I apologized to her profusely and again told her I just have my own baggage from my parents and it gets to me sometimes. I told her I just want her to use the chances she has now. She told me she will never be able to forgive me and that she will always ""think about how cruel"" I was to her. I know I messed up but I still don't understand why she can't just speak to her parents. AITA?

1fxtzjf,AITA for telling my friend I won't be inviting her out anymore?,"So my bf tells me im not the asshole but I feel like I may be. So I F23 have a friend I'll call Mary who's 22. She and I work together and became friends. Well this past Saturday, I invited her out with my friend group to go to a local amusement park that goes all out for Halloween 

Mary asks if she can bring her kids a 5 year old boy and an 18 month old girl. Everyone involved tells her it's really not a good idea as this park and it's haunted attractions are not geared towards children and we're planning on being there until it closes which is midnight.

She seems to accept this but asks repeatedly throughout the week leading up to Saturday and she is again told no. Well Saturday arrived and as you can guess, she brought her kids. Other people in our group asks her why and she just shrugged saying she thought the kids would have fun.

They didn't, her son got scared with in about 10 minutes of us getting into the park and began to cry begging to go home to which Mary tells him to calm down and he'll have fun eventually. We get in line for the first haunted house and her son again starts to cry saying he doesn't want to go into the house. Mary then asks myself if I'll stay and watch her son and daughter so she can go into the haunted house. 

I tell her no and that this is why we told her not to bring her kids. She gets upset and drags her very scared child through the haunted house. He had a melt down and had to be carried out. This repeats through every single haunted house we attempted to go through.

Around 11:30, my boyfriend pulls me aside and tells me that he can't take anymore of the screaming/crying and we try to break off to find a place to calm down, Mary sees this and leaves her son and daughter with us while she runs off to go on a ride. Her son gets scared by an actor chasing people with a chainsaw and has an epic melt down. I'm doing the best I can to console him but I am rapidly running out of patients. Finally his mom comes back and I all but shove her son back into her arms 

I tell Mary that my bf and I were leaving along with the rest of our group. She gets huffy but agreed. We leave the park and go to waffle House for dinner. At this point it's midnight and both kids are extremely tired and upset. They cry all through dinner and Mary did nothing to calm them down. Finally at the end of my rope, once we get out of the restaurant I lose my temper. I tell Mary that this is why she was told not to bring her kids to this event and that I will not be inviting her back out again if she can't follow the rules of the group. Mary got upset and has since blocked me and the other people who agreeded with me. No one in the group agreed with Mary but they all did say that I didn't need to say anything about it to her and I didn't need to tell her I wasn't inviting her out again.

Of course, I offered to replace the pillow and Wendy sent me the link to where she bought it. It was SEVENTY DOLLARS for a tiny little carrot pillow. I told her I would definitely replace it, but I would probably have to wait for a few weeks for my next check because that eats into my gas money. She seemed a little pissy and I felt bad.

Yesterday, my other friends wanted to go thrifting for their Halloween costumes. I already got mine, but wanted to tag along. I thought it was my lucky day because at one of the thrift stores was the exact pillow! Like the very same one with the tag from the store and everything. The thrift store was selling it for twelve dollars, so I got it because it was cheaper and now Wendy would be able to have her complete living room quicker than we thought.

Fast forward a couple hours and we all go over to Wendy’s to show her the Halloween haul and I present her with the pillow. First she was happy, but then she was like “How are you gonna get to work?” I explained that I found it at a thrift store and she threw it at me and acted all grossed out.

Now I’m confused because we all go thrifting all the time, including Wendy. But Wendy was like, “I don’t buy soft furnishings at the thrift store.” I offered to wash it and bring it back, but she said no and still demanded that I buy the one from the actual store. I said no, I would wash the thrifted pillow for her, but I’m not buying a pillow for seventy dollars. She said it was my fault for spilling wine in the first place and said I was “too clumsy to live.” Then I said for someone who wants to host parties, you’re being a big brat about a little spill. 

We left it at that, but I left a few minutes later because I could tell Wendy was really annoyed at me. Now the friend group is taking sides and one of my friend’s girlfriend told me that now there’s a group chat that doesn’t have me or Wendy in it called “The Pillow Crisis of 2024” where everyone is arguing who is in the right. 

I did wash the pillow and gave it to my friend to give it to Wendy, but apparently she refused to put it on her couch and it now resides in the floor pillow pile. So, AITA?

(tl;dr: I spilled wine on my friend’s very expensive throw pillow. I replaced it with the identical pillow from the thrift store at a lower price. My friend wasn’t happy and demanded that I buy it from the actual store. I refused and insults were thrown back and forth. AITA?)

Edit 2: Some new info I learned from the group chat (that I’m still not a part of), Wendy took the tags off the thrifted pillow so there’s no returning it now.

1fu2lm5,AITA for not paying for private school tuition for GF's special needs child?,"This is throwaway because everyone knows my main.

The conflict is between me (44M) and my girlfriend (34F). My GF and I have been together for 5 years, living together for 2 years. She has a son (12M) from a previous relationship. Her son has ASD. In my early 20s, I started a business with my best friend. It has done very well and I am comfortable financially. I was previously married, and when I got divorced, ex took more than her pound of flesh financially. So, when I got with my GF, I told her, her expenses where her expenses, my expenses were my expenses. And we would never get married. She agreed and understood.

My GF's son previously went to a local private school. This school provided lots of resources for kids with special needs. He thrived there. My best friend's kids go to the same school. They are not special needs, but the school is good overall regardless of that. My GF's son's tuition was paid for by his bio dad and GF's dad. 

Here is where I might be the AH. My best friend, a couple of years ago, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. He unfortunately died this past spring. I promised him I would look after his wife and kids. About a year ago, GF's ex (the bio dad) lost his job and can no longer contribute to tuition. GF's dad cannot cover it (bio dad paid like 85%). So, GF's son is in public school right now and struggling. Meanwhile, I am paying the tuition for best friend's kids based on my promise to him. GF approached me and asked if I would contribute something so her son could go back to the school. I refused. She called me an AH because I am helping a woman who I am not in a relationship with while refusing to give her the exact same help. I see her point, but we had an agreement when we got together. 

AITA?

1fx0ur0,AITA for refusing to let my friend’s service dog into my house because I’m allergic?,"I have a pretty severe dog allergy, and I recently invited a small group of friends over for a game night. One of my friends has a service dog for his anxiety, which I totally respect. But I told him beforehand that I can’t be around dogs because of my allergies.

He said it wouldn’t be an issue because I could just take allergy meds and keep windows open. I tried to explain that even with meds, I’d still be uncomfortable, and honestly, I don’t want a dog in my house for hours. He said I was being ableist and not considering his needs, even though I feel like I’m the one who would physically suffer.

The rest of the group is split—some say I’m being unfair to him, others think it’s reasonable because it’s my house and my health. Now I’m second-guessing myself.

1gaoypm,AITA for telling my husband I won’t be going to his birthday dinner since he asked if I would leave early anyway?,"For context, I will be 38 weeks pregnant on my husband’s birthday this year. 

The previous week, I reluctantly allowed his sister to pick my daughter up from school so she could spend the day with her and his parents (she does half days still). I say reluctantly because they have continuously crossed parental boundaries in the past, but that’s a different story. It had been a while, and she loves them and I truly want them to have a relationship, so I gave it another go. 

Anyway, my husband and I went to pick her up at his parents and while there, his sister asked what he was doing for his birthday coming up. I had asked him a number of times already what he wanted to do, had thrown out some ideas for us to do as a family as well, but he never decided on anything. So, he says he doesn’t have plans. She asked if he wanted her to make him dinner at her apartment then and he said yeah, that sounds good. It would be a family dinner: his parents, her partner, and our family. All good. 

Tonight, he said that we could drive separately because he doesn’t want to leave early. He asked me at dinner if I would leave early with our daughter so I could put her to bed. He wants to stay and drink and smoke and be up late. 

This majorly upset me because this whole pregnancy has not felt like a partnership what so ever. He only made one of my several ultrasounds (I’m over 35, so get a good amount of them), works almost every weekend voluntarily vs. making plans with my daughter and I, put off doing things I physically cannot do for the nursery until the third trimester I’ve been asking him to do since the first. I’ve also asked him to look into ways he can support me during birth and not a single google search has been made to that effect. 

I’m not sure if I’m being the crazy pregnant lady, but it certainly feels like he just wants to do whatever he wants without any regard to me carrying this child he told me desperately wanted (I was fine with one). Our birthdays are close, the baby’s due date is only two days after mine (so I’ll be 40 weeks for my birthday if  she doesn’t decide to arrive before then). 

So for my birthday, I don’t get to do anything but be pregnant and wait for baby. It would be nice to feel like he wants to spend these special occasions with me/my daughter and I. He clearly is not empathetic to the fact that I can’t go out and do these things for this period of time, so to be told to go home he can is hurtful. 

I told him that in that case, I don’t even want to be there and she (my daughter) and I aren’t going to dinner. Honestly, I would not be in a mood to celebrate and just get upset anyway. But it does constantly feel like as much as he claims to be a family guy, spending quality time with us doesn’t matter to him.

1g61v0o,"AITA for refusing to let my neighbor cut down my tree because it ""blocks her view""?","I (34M) live in a quiet suburban neighborhood, and my house has a large oak tree in the front yard. It’s been there for decades, long before I moved in, and honestly, it’s one of the things I love about the property. It gives shade, keeps the yard cool in the summer, and just generally looks great.

Recently, my new neighbor (40sF) moved into the house across the street. She seems nice enough, but we don’t really talk much, just the occasional wave. A couple of weeks ago, she knocked on my door and asked if I’d consider cutting down my tree. I was confused and asked why, and she said it “blocks her view of the sunset.”

Now, I’ve lived here for years, and I’ve never had any complaints about the tree, from neighbors or otherwise. It’s perfectly healthy, and it’s not hanging over anyone’s property. Plus, I enjoy the view with the tree, and it’s part of the charm of my yard.

I politely told her that I wasn’t interested in removing the tree, especially for something like that. She got annoyed and said it’s a “reasonable request” because the tree “ruins” her evening view from her porch. I didn’t want to escalate things, so I just said I’d think about it and ended the conversation.

A few days later, she came back with pamphlets from a tree removal service and tried again, this time offering to pay for the removal. I declined again, saying that the tree’s important to me and I don’t want to get rid of it. She got visibly upset and said something like, “It’s just a tree, why are you being so difficult?”

Since then, she’s been giving me the cold shoulder, and I’ve heard from a couple of neighbors that she’s been telling people I’m being unreasonable. I honestly don’t think I am, but now I’m wondering if I’m missing something.

1gf6i1t,AITA for refusing to invite my brother’s fiancée to my wedding because of her Instagram account?,"So, here’s the situation. My (28F) wedding is coming up in a few months, and I’ve been planning it for over a year with my fiancé, Jake (29M). Everything’s been going smoothly—except for one major issue with my brother’s (30M) fiancée, *Amber* (27F).

Amber has a large following on Instagram, where she posts very revealing photos of herself. She’s been into “fitness modeling” for a few years now, and while I have no issue with her career, I feel uncomfortable with some of the attention it brings. For example, at my engagement party, she showed up in a tight mini-dress and spent half the night live-streaming the event to her followers, some of whom were commenting… let’s just say *inappropriately*. I didn’t say anything then, but it made me feel awkward.

Jake and I have been envisioning a fairly private and family-oriented wedding. We don’t want anything about it going on social media, and we also don’t want Amber’s followers gawking at our wedding photos or seeing our special day as just another “shoot” for her profile. I spoke to her privately and asked if she’d agree to keep her phone away during the ceremony and reception. She brushed me off, saying, “It’s my brand. It’s who I am,” and she made no promises.

This has been weighing on me a lot, so I told my brother that if she can’t respect my request, I’d prefer she not attend. He exploded and accused me of judging her lifestyle and her career. He also said that if she can’t come, he might not come either, and now my whole family is furious with me. Jake supports me, but he’s worried it’ll cause permanent damage with my brother.

I used to love them but now I hate them. I had a princess set, unicorns, butterflies, and flowers. I “accidentally” stained the princess set so she donated it but now I’m stuck with the unicorns, flowers, and butterflies.

1fyjc8z,AITA for leaving concert early?,"My wife is a huge PINK fan, and has seen her in concert 5 times. I also quite like Pink, and I went to 2 of those shows and enjoyed them immensely.

Unfortunately, the third time wasn't the charm.

Months in advance of the concert last night, my wife bought 4 tickets, 2 for us, 2 for a couple of her friends. It was a beautiful day, we had no traffic or parking problems, and got to our (very good) seats as the opening acts were starting. Everything was good. None of us particularly cared about the openers, so it wasn't a big concern that the sound was muddy and all loud bass during those performances. I knew from past experience that the acoustics for Pink would be great. It would be well worth waiting thru 3 hours of noise to see her.

I was wrong.

About 50 minutes into Pink's performance, wherein I could only make out about every third word she sang, and couldn't hear her vocal range at all. I felt tremendously disappointed, and gave my wife the car keys and said I was going home (a 4 mile walk.) (She and her friends were enjoying the concert far more than I was.)

Today, my wife is angry at me. ""You ruined it for me."" ""You embarrassed me in front of my friends."" ""I could have spent that $300 on someone who WANTED to see the show."" When I responded that me leaving didn't affect her seeing the show, I was told, ""You don't care about my feelings at all."" I asked, ""What about my feelings?""

She refused to discuss it further, and is just still mad at me.

Should I have stayed and been miserable myself for 2 more hours? (I absolutely would have done that, if we'd gone alone. With her friends there, I didn't think I was ""abandoning"" her.)

1g7ki0p,AITA for not letting my sister move in with me when she and her kids were facing homelessness?,"
Here’s a little bit of back story

In 2022, my sister (22F) had asked if she, her boyfriend (23M) and her newborn (6mo F) could stay with us for 1-3 months (which turned into 11 months) until they had gotten their taxes so they could save up and move to another place.

my partner and I agreed (21F & 20M) because it was only going to be a few months and I didn’t want them to be potentially homeless, with an infant. I had only 3 actual rules. A.) Take care of the wood floors B.) Help out with rent when they can C.) No births. 

My sister stayed home with the baby mostly, while us 3 worked through the day. But soon, so we’re consistently piles of dishes, dirty diapers, food trash, and just things left around.  And they had also spent all their tax money and asked if they could stay longer. 

After a while, my sister was getting really comfortable with asking me to watch my niece. I would end up watching my niece almost every night/off day for 1-5 hours. It got to the point where my partner and I couldn’t really hang out. Them living with us was starting to have an affect on mine and my partners relationship at that point. 

She had gotten prescribed birth control. Shortly after, I started to notice a bunch of ovulation tests in our bathroom. 

Not long after that appointment She happily came up to me and showed me a positive pregnancy test. She tried to lie and say that she was too fertile for birth control to work.m and said that it was accident. But it was so hard to believe. So then I told them both, they had to leave before that baby was born. 

When they moved out, Her boyfriend literally said to me before they left “wow your house looks TRASHED!” And then left. Their bedroom floors were super sticky, random substance on the walls, and a shit ton of dirty dishes were left For me to clean up. 

Now, it’s been about a year and a half since they left. And currently, my partner is having some heart issues causing him to be out of work and will need surgery. So I’m riding solo to keep a roof over our head, bills paid, and food in the fridge. 

My sister called me in a panic. Saying that her and her two babies that are now toddlers are going to be homeless because she was  on a waitlist for a rental assistance apartment And that she had done everything she could, and her boyfriend had been having issues keeping a job because he has a felony. And she had asked if she and my niece and nephew could stay with me for a few weeks. 

But I told her, no. I couldn’t take on anymore responsibilities than what I already have. That I’m having difficulty keeping up with my own shit. I suggested if they could reach out to her boyfriends parents, and see if they could help in any way. They agreed to let them stay. I called to check up on them, no response (which is very very unusual for her) and I feel like she may be upset with me, I just frankly have so much going on that I couldn’t go through that again.

We’re both students so we had to budget where we could, so we bought basic economy tickets and just took whatever seats they assigned us. They were both middle seats, which was expected, but when we boarded the plane home, it was obvious that one seat was much better than the other.

Julie was assigned to a seat between a morbidly obese man who was spilling into her seat, and a woman on her other side who wasn’t as huge but was still quite big. My seat was next to two normal sized people. The thing is, I’m pretty big–6’5” and 220 with broad shoulders. Julie isn’t tiny herself–she’s 5’10 and 165–but obviously she’s much smaller than me. Julie immediately asked if we could switch seats, to which I said no. I knew Julie would be uncomfortable in the seats, but I don’t even think I could fit between the passengers on either side of her. After some arguing back and forth, Julie sighed and went to her seat.

I thought it wasn’t a big deal, but Julie was very cold to me when we landed. I offered to get us dinner on the way out but she said her back hurt from the flight and she wanted to lay down. I got the hint that she was upset about the seating arrangement. I told her it wasn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things and it was only a 2 hour flight, and that it’s better her than me because she’s smaller. She told me to drop it and just drive her home. 

That night, I went to hang out with some of our mutual friends (Julie had originally planned on coming with too, but she did not come). They asked where Julie was and I told her she was upset with me. When I told them why, the general consensus was that I should have switched seats with her because it was the chivalrous thing to do, though some people agreed Julie was overreacting. They said it wasn’t about who was bigger, it was about me protecting my girlfriend. Now I kinda feel like a dick and like I should apologize.

1g3sfh5,WIBTA if I told my best friend her wedding sounds like a nightmare?,"So my (27/f) best friend ""Claire"" (27/f) is getting married in February. I'm the maid of honor, which is making me feel like I'd be a super asshole for saying anything.

They're having a small wedding, about 50 people and they're having it at a family members property near a lake. Which is all great, no problems with that.

The nightmare part is the fact that this 50 person wedding is an ALL DAY event. They're having a rehearsal brunch at 10am instead of a rehearsal dinner. And then their ceremony is at 12:30pm. And then they have ""group activities"" scheduled from 2pm-7pm (they've listed cornhole as an example) finally, at 7pm, we eat dinner and the reception is supposed to last till 10:30pm. 

And finally, it's a completely dry wedding. And I had zero objection to the dry wedding until they sent me this agenda. I don't think I need alcohol to have fun. But to spend 12 hours in a nice dress and heels, running around with 50 people I either don't know or barely know (it's mainly family, I'm the only friend from our high school group invited, so I really only know her parents, I've met her fiancee twice), I think I'm going to need at least 2 glasses of wine. 

I feel like an asshole, because it is her day and I love her, but I really think this sounds like a disaster. If I'm just sounding snooty and stuck up, please tell me. I don't want to be a jerk to my best friend. They told me this is just an idea for right now and hadn't been finalized, but they also didn't really ask what I thought, either.",aita-wedding-ta,1476,932,0.9399999976158142,0.09710309919281379,1728944286,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g3sfh5/wibta_if_i_told_my_best_friend_her_wedding_sounds/,2024,10

However, after a few weeks into the season, Ethan started saying he wants to quit the team. He says he’s not having fun anymore, the practices are too intense, and the coach is really hard on them. I understand it’s tough, but I’ve always believed in following through on commitments. I told him that he needs to finish the season since he made the decision to join the team, and quitting now would let his teammates down. I said that after the season, if he doesn’t want to continue, that’s fine, but he has to see this commitment through.

Ethan’s really upset with me and says I’m being unfair and not understanding how much he’s struggling.

1gcvqwf,AITA because i refuse to drive my coworkers home without compensation?,"I (25M) have been offering/accepting requests from coworkers to give them a lift home whenever possible. I never asked for any compensation since it is only about a 15-20-minute detour.   
But, about a month ago, I finally had the opportunity to buy a new car. Beforehand, I had a 1999 Ford Fiesta; it was my first car, and I barely spent any money on gas.   
I don't have many financial responsibilities, so I chose to enjoy being a young man with a decent salary and bought a supercar. I LOVE my new car, and so do my coworkers, which means a lot more requests started coming my way for lifts home.   
I've worked at my current job for about 6 months, and I've probably done over 100 detours to make my coworkers happy.   
Here's the problem; not ONCE have I been offered any form of compensation from any of them, even though they would've had to pay for public transport, if I didn't offer them a lift.   
Now, my new car is quite a bit more expensive than my old one, which means it does not drive that far km/l (approx 12-13 km/l). 

Apparently, this is completely otherworldly for my coworkers. Today, I said no for the first time. I got asked if I could give them a lift, and I said: (sure, if you pay me the fee you would have to for public transport, I'll drive you home), and this did not sit well with them.   
I think I'm being as fair as possible, since I don't want to keep losing money by giving them a free service, that they don't seem to appreciate.

It wasn’t horrible and our parents did in all honesty a great job with all us.  I think really the only problem we had was Aiden who was the first out and knew he was the first out had a pretty big ego and felt he was superior over the other four of us and tried to push us around. Our parents did what they could to keep him inline and for the most part the rest of us would ignore him

Three years ago my brother decided to marry his then girlfriend. Our family for the most part are pretty laid back. This is good because out of the five of us, I’m the gay one. Up to a certain point it was never really an issue.  Or so I thought.   His wife’s family complete opposite. Highly political (Conservative) and devote Catholic. Again to each their own and it wasn’t anything for us to talk to him about.  If she makes him happy then there isn’t anything we can do about it.  When they got married I wasn’t included in any part of it.  Her parents were paying for it and they had the final say and said they couldn’t allow a gay person in the wedding party or in the church. My brothers, sisters and parents say they fought to get me invited, but were shot down each time.  My sisters were part of the wedding party but none declined.  My dad offered to stay with me for the day and we would do something.  I told him it was okay and both parents needed to be at the wedding.  The day of the wedding a couple of friends took a day trip.  We had a great time but it still would have been nice to see Aiden get married.

Not long after the wedding I was on vacation and met someone.  Long distance as it maybe three years later we have been making it work.  We have been talking about one of moving and I told him I loved Seattle and that if anyone was going to move it was going to be me.

Last night mom and dad asked for all of us to come for dinner.  I didn’t say much at all and everyone was talking and I was just listening and on occasion say a yes or no or answer an easy question. My dad finally noticed and looked over and asked if I was okay.  I just told him I have a lot on my mind and he asked what’s going on “I’m moving to Seattle  The room went crazy.  I can’t say I was being attacked but it still felt like it with the way everyone was firing off all their questions and calling me an asshole for breaking the five of us up. Dinner ended shortly after and Dad and I went out to his barn and talked for a long time.  Weather he gave it to me or not I am going to move.  But he gave me his blessing and told me he would help however he could.

Today Deanna and Beth came over and started in right away.  They started blaming Will for splitting the five of us up and calling me an asshole for not taking the rest of us into consideration. I told them it’s not a big deal and at least one of us has the ambition to move on with their life.

1fwcqhh,AITA for telling my husband that I think his brother and wife are bad parents for trying to make us watch his kid 24/7 when we visit?,"
Whenever I’m visiting the in laws (~3-4 times per year), we stay at my brother in laws house because they have an extra bedroom (and also insist we stay with them). My brother in law and his wife expect near 24/7 babysitting because I’m not working during these trips. They leave my niece with me and start asking and telling me to do things like can I feed her, why doesn’t she read a book with me, and not to let her watch tv. They basically just disappear into their own worlds the whole day (one goes to work and the other works at home). 

I don’t mind helping out for a few hours here and there but being expected to just watch her the whole day during the whole vacation (if I don’t have plans outside of the house) seems excessive to me and I find myself growing very resentful. I honestly don’t understand what they do when I’m not around as they don’t have a babysitter normally. Whenever I express that I’m tired or try to get away for some rest, they end up commenting later on in a “joking” way how me and my husband should reconsider having kids in the future since we get tired so easily. Or that we should watch my niece for a longer period of time (I.e. weeks) before seriously considering a child. These comments rub me the wrong way and seem so inappropriate to me because obviously having a child is a lot of work, but just because I don’t want to watch their child 24/7 doesn’t mean they can say such rude things to me. 

I’ve complained to my husband a few times but he seems to think that this is all normal and that this level of expectation for babysitting is also totally normal and “part of the culture” (they are south Asian). However I’m not really sure if this is the case because the tried to have their other sibling (sister) who lives in the same city agree to scheduling babysitting their kid one to two weekends every month and they obviously refused leading to a small fight. 

Recently I got so annoyed at their behavior over the past few trips (especially leaving their child with me and my husband when we have been feeling unwell and sick), that I told my husband that I don’t like his brother and think that him and his wife are extremely self centered and demanding people who are bad parents because they are always trying to pawn their kid off on other people. This obviously started a big fight as my husband feels close to his brother.

I (24F) posted a picture of my husband (25M) enjoying a chocolate milkshake after he had a surgery to put in a port. He hasn't had much of an appetite for weeks so him just having a milkshake was SO exciting to me. Well, a former family friend ""Cathy"" (in her 60s) had an opinion about that. She sent me a long text about being more considerate with what I share and that people won't appreciate seeing us ""splurging on expensive sugary and fatty"" milkshakes after we asked for some help earlier this week.

Yes, it's true that we made a small meal train to help us get through this week. That's the only help we asked for. Not a dime, just some comfort meals and prayers.

We went back and forth a bit. She then went on this rant about how she never asked for help when her house flooded... as if that's at all comparable to my husband starting cancer treatment. I shouldn't have kept responding to her and should have just blocked her immediately, but I didn't, and at some point I asked her if she was still a therapist, which she claimed was a ""personal attack"".

This isn't his first run-in with the law, and he's been in and out of trouble for years.

My girlfriend called me in a panic, asking if I could help bail him out. The bail amount was pretty steep, and she didn't have enough money to cover it. While I do have the funds, I have serious reservations about using my savings to bail out someone who clearly hasn't learned from their past mistakes. Plus, I work hard for my money and have my own financial goals and responsibilities.

I told her that I couldn't help this time, and she was really upset. She argued that family should always come first and that I was being selfish. I tried to explain my reasoning, but she wasn't having it. She ended up borrowing money from her parents to get him out, but now things are tense between us.

1g6vjst,AITA for asking my parents to start paying rent if they want to keep living with me?,"I’m (19F) in kind of a weird situation. I recently inherited my late grandmother’s house. It’s not a mansion, but it’s a comfortable home in a decent neighborhood. Here’s the thing: my parents (50s) moved in with me shortly after, saying it was temporary because they were struggling financially after some bad investments.



At first, I was fine with it. I mean, they’re my parents, right? But it’s been over six months now, and they seem really comfortable here—too comfortable. They don’t seem to be looking for new jobs or places to live. I’ve been paying for all the utilities, groceries, and maintenance out of my own money, which I saved up while working part-time and from the small inheritance I received.



They keep making these small comments about how it’s “their home too” since I wouldn’t have the house without them and my grandmother. They even redecorated part of it without asking me! I tried bringing up the issue, suggesting they could contribute financially at least by paying rent or utilities, but they got upset. My mom said, “We’re family, we don’t charge each other,” and my dad said it’s selfish to ask them to pay when they’re struggling. But I’m also struggling with balancing work and school, and it’s not like they’re making an effort to move out or even lighten the financial burden.



I love them, but I feel like they’re taking advantage of the situation. I don’t want to evict my own parents, but this is my space and I feel like I have no control over my own home anymore.

1fzce77,AITA for refusing to apologize for something I never did?,"Using a throwaway account.

I graduated high school 15 years ago. We recently had our 15 year school reunion.

Anyway, during high school, there was this kid named Ivan. I didn't interact much with him, but he hated me. For the life of my I didn't understand why as I hardly ever talked with him. Until one day during our senior I learned that he hated me because he thought I was telling people he was gay. I never did and I asked why he thought I was telling people that.

He refused to elaborate and said someone told him I was telling people he was gay (he wasn't to the best of my knowledge). I told him I""m sorry he thinks that, but I never said that to anyone.

Come our high school reunion and he again confronts me for calling him gay. I once more say I never did. He accuses me of lying and demands I apologize. I refuse and he goes off saying I'm a bullying AH and that he's tired of people assuming he's gay because of me.

I again said I never said that, and to be honest, I don't care if someone is gay or not because I don't have a problem with it. He storms off saying it was a waste of time coming and he wishes he would have known ahead of time that I was there.

Maybe I should have apologized just to give him closure or something. It was probably a little childish, but I've had to apologize before for things I never did and I hated it but I don't know. Should have I apologized? And I don't want to give the impression I think there is anything worng with someone being gay or thinking someone might be gay because there isn't.

1g31bx3,AITA for refusing to pay double my own meal bill at a family event?,"We had a family meal out for my Nan's birthday yesterday. Family included:

Nan
Family A: Two parents with three adult children, ages 18,23,25.
Family B: Two parents with disabled, adult son.
Adult C
Family D: Two parents with two, school-aged children.
Me (30F)
This was arranged by my Family A 25F cousin, with meals pre-ordered from a fixed price menu. I chose a two-course meal plus soft drink. Everybody else (minus young children) had a three-course meal, two alcoholic drinks & a hot drink each.

(For the sake of maths, I've removed the service charge/tips from the bill)

The bill arrived, & I expected to pay for my meal & drink, plus ~£2.00 towards Nan's meal (each of us contributed, so Nan ate for free). My meal was £18.95, plus £2.50 drink, so I was expecting a bill ~£25.00. The three-course meal everybody else had was £22.95, & each person spent a similar figure on alcoholic & hot drinks, plus their own contribution to Nan's meal. My adult (18-25) cousins in Families A & B would be paid for by their parents.

My Family A 25F cousin said each adult owed £50.00, including division of school-aged children's meals amongst everybody. I checked my sums again - my bill was definitely £25.00 - but nobody mentioned that I'd consumed half of what everybody else had because they either wanted a cheaper bill or wanted to go home, so I reminded my cousin of my smaller meal & lack of alcoholic & hot drinks.

I left the room for five minutes, & chaos ensued. Everybody was shouting at everybody, & my Family D brother-in-law started yelling at me whilst my Family A aunt shouted at him 'She's not MY granddaughter, so why do I have to pay for her?!'. People then glared at me or avoided my eyes, & Family B aunt said 'You! Why can't you just muck in like everybody else?!' & when I said I can't afford to pay double what my actual bill was, she said 'Then why didn't you say that at the start? What do we do, not invite you to future events?!' My Family A 23M cousin paid the bill, & later messaged each person with what they owed him.

For reference, we have never split bills 'down the middle'. With different, individual family sizes involved including children with an age range of twenty years, it's not been fair to do so, so historically bills have been paid with each family paying their own way. Now, with the aforementioned children now being adults, this rule has shifted a couple of times to splitting a bill equally amongst all of the adults, with no thought towards anyone (usually me) who consumed less food & no alcohol. I challenged this once before, & my Family A aunt announced 'SHE (me) is paying [£10.00 for jacket potato & Coke], & EVERYBODY ELSE is paying [£35.00 for a two-course meal & two G&Ts]!', making everybody roll their eyes at me for being difficult/different/a tight arse, etc.

My friend from college was getting engaged and told me when she thought it was happening. She said she thought it was happening soon. They had been together for 3 years which was a long time for an engagement and she said relatives were starting to talk and making her feel like her bf was just screwing around with her and not serious about it.

Then she called me several times in a week which was a lot more often and seemed out of it. I asked her what was wrong and she cried on the phone and admitted the reason he had not proposed was because his parents back in India wanted a large dowry and her family in the US was refusing to pay it. She said her family has been in the US for 2 generations and no one has paid a dowry in that time but his parents are old fashioned and think if they don’t receive a dowry it will show there is something wrong with their family. I don’t understand their reasoning but I told her to break up if he won’t fight for them to be together. She said he won’t because he sees it as something to be discussed between their parents. I’m kind of shocked she still wants to marry this guy. His parents are in India, he is a grown ass man and he won’t marry his gf just because they want money. 

At the end of last year her parents agreed to pay a dowry because she begged them. She says it’s much lower than they asked and they are not happy but agreed. 

I got an invite for their wedding for Jan 2025 in California. I called her and told her I couldn’t attend and apologized. She was shocked and said I was one of the few friends she could invite and I said I couldn’t because I don’t think I should go to a wedding if I don’t think she is marrying a good person. She said she disagrees with the dowry practices but it wasn’t for me to judge if demanding it meant someone was a good person. I just said I disagree with the wedding happening because her parents had to effectively bribe someone to have it happen. She got mad and said I should RSVP no and hung up. I feel guilty because she clearly wanted me there but the whole thing is really gross to me. But AITA for judging cultural practices from a culture I’m not a part of?

To my surprise, she said they didn't leave any for me cause ealier in the day, she had bought me some lunch, so I shouldn't be hungry by the time I arrived home. (I ate at 1pm. And left work at about 11pm. At night)

So today, she bought sushi again, cause I asked her to, since I felt annoyed they left me out last weekend

Long story short, she said I'd have to share it with my sister (even if she had some last time and didn't leave any for me) and got annoyed when I asked her if I really had to.

I got upset and said I wasn't hungry anymore.

So, am I the a-hole for that? It made me feel crappy either way, dude. ",ProofStuff6903,2562,212,0.9399999976158142,0.0689781262145223,1729812206,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gbge2n/aita_for_getting_up_from_the_table_when_my_mom/,2024,10
1galk15,AITA for canceling Thanksgiving dinner without telling my family first? ,"So I, (30s F) am a single mom and I currently live with my kids and my mom, who is also single. I always cook Holiday dinners, as my Mother can’t cook. This would have been our 3rd thanksgiving dinner. The issue isn’t her lack of cooking. The issue is that she invites guests without telling me until the last minute. And she doesn’t actually ask, because she will have already invited them and will tell me by posing it as a question. “Oh by the way, I invited your (insert random family member) to come for dinner. Is it ok?” Like lady, you already told them to, so of course if i say no it starts drama. She knows I dislike her family because they are all drama, including her since she entertains it. 

So this year I have decided to not cook Thanksgiving dinner. She asked me the other day what was on the menu for this year and I told her nothing and my reason why. She loudly says wow and then tried to guilt trip me by reminding me this would be our last year living together. She is retiring and bought a house back in her home country. I told her she will live 30 mins away driving distance. So she chill on the dramatics, and also my kids and I will not be made to feel uncomfortable in our own house. She tried to deny we were uncomfortable m, until I reminded her we spend the entire time in my room watching movies, until they all leave. 

I didn’t feel bad at the time but a co-worker of mine did say maybe I should have spoken to her about it instead of her finding out the way she did. So AITA for canceling dinner without telling my mom first?

1g3tx6f,AITA for not firing the babysitter for driving the kids without car seats,"My ex and I have 3 kids, 4, 3, and 1. I have a regular babysitter, Emma, to watch the kids 3 days a week from 6:30pm-7:30am. She gets the kids ready for bed after dinner, gets them in bed, gets them up and dressed in the mornings, and gets them breakfast. Emma never has to drive the kids so we never got her car seats. 

Last week there was a gas leak. The police and fire department were banging on the doors telling everyone to evacuate. Emma called me but I don’t have my phone on me at work. She called my work but the front desk isn’t the best at picking up the phone at night. At that point she grabbed the kids and took them to Walmart, 5 miles away, and bought car seats, diapers, a change of clothes for everyone, and some other essentials (I reimbursed her). She installed the car seats and brought the kids to my work. I was able to take a few minutes to find somewhere for her to take the kids for the night and the rest of the night went smoothly. 

The kids went to their dad’s house a couple days after and told him they got to ride in Emma’s car without car seats. My ex called to ask about it and I explained that there was a gas leak, they were under mandatory evacuation, and she got them car seats as soon as possible. He asked why she didn’t have car seats and I told him that in the 8 months that she has been working for me, she never had to drive them before this and I can’t afford to spend $700 on car seats that are going to live in the garage. He asked what I did to Emma about her driving them without car seats and I told him I didn’t do anything since she didn’t have another choice. He’s mad that I didn’t fire her and wants to try to get full custody because he doesn’t trust me or her to take care of the kids anymore (he’s a weekend dad).

1g7lrzp,AITA for refusing to take down my IG photos of my ex and lie? ,My bf and I have been dating for about a year. We had already bought flight and organized everything with his parents but he said his parents are hesitating. He is suppose to bring me home to his parents for thanksgiving weekend but last weekend told me I should delete the photos of my ex. I asked which ex and he said “the black one”. The “black ex” and I dated in college and he was a Tanzanian who did his masters here. We broke up after a year because he decided to go back home but before that we climbed Kilimanjaro together. I have photos of us studying together and climbing Kilimanjaro together. That was years and my bf knows about it. I questioned why it was such a big deal and he admitted one of his mom’s friend’s daughters was snooping and saw it and told their mom who told their friend (his mom). I was shocked people actually do that and told him it was insane to do. He agreed but said now his parents are asking him if he is dating a girl who dated a black guy. he admitted his parents are pretty racist and wouldn’t like me if I admitted I dated a black guy. I have Asian parents too and I know that racism is common but to judge a girl for DATING a guy from a race they didn’t like is over the top even for traditional Asian parents. He wants me to take down the photos and if his parents asks to tell them that my ex and I were just friends. I pissed and told him I’m not hiding my ex like a dirty secret and I’m not bowing to them like that. He got mad and said I just have to do those things so they will approve of the relationship and not cause us trouble in the future. I know lying doesn’t cost me anything but it makes me so uncomfortable when they are so bigoted they would hate their son’s gf because she dated a black guy is crazy!

1ggsgve,AITA for nixing my son's Halloween costume that his mom okayed and his stepdad paid for?,"My 10yo Caleb told me on Tuesday that he was going to be a 1980s lifeguard for Halloween. I have him Thursday thru Sunday so I picked him up from school after their Halloween event. 

He wasn't a lifeguard but a caveman. I was a bit confused.  My son said he was still going to be a lifeguard for trick or treating. 30 minutes ago he showed me his costume. It was a mullet wig, a lifeguard parka, 80s sun visor glasses and flip glops.

Oh and speedo briefs. 

That's why he wore a different costume at school. Obviously he wasn't going to wear a speedo at school. I said you are not going outside in a speedo. He said his mom was fine with it and his stepdad paid for everything. He thought it was funny.

I said you can wear your costume all you want in the house but not outside.",Equivalent-Golf561,1251,452,0.9200000166893005,0.058364912143888344,1730418453,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ggsgve/aita_for_nixing_my_sons_halloween_costume_that/,2024,10
1gamuu9,AITA for preventing my ex from getting 50/50 custody or our daughter?,"Ex and I separated a few months ago and in the beginning, we were in agreement that 50/50 was the best thing for our daughter. Then we went to the first mediation and I learned he expected me to be fully responsible for finding and paying for childcare on his weeks as well as my own. And if I couldn’t find childcare he expected me to pick her up in the morning before he went to work and bring her back to him when he got back to his apartment. I was not okay with that and said as much. We didn't get anywhere because he insisted all childcare-related tasks were my responsibility since I had always done them. 

After of mediation, he continued to argue with me and I told him that 50/50 custody means he is 100% responsible during his time with her and I am 100% responsible during my time. His counter-off was still 50/50 custody but she could stay with me most of the summer and he would see her everyother weekend but we still switch weeks during the school year. 

I again refused and told him “50/50 custody means 50/50 all year long not just when it's convenient for you.” That apparently got through to him and he's told me I can have primary physical custody and he will take her every other weekend and we split holidays during the school year when he can take vacation to stay with her instead of working. 

But now he’s told his family about our disagreement and they are texting and calling me because I'm stealing his child from him. They think I should continue to be responsible for all childcare all year long since he works so hard and needs the help. His mother was being particularly vocal about it and I asked her why doesn't she volunteer to pay for childcare for him. Her response was that it's too expensive and not her responsibility. Again I disagreed because im not her son's nanny. I told the rest of his family the same thing.

I was sure I was right until his sister who I've always thought of as level-headed also told me I was being unfair. Ex hasn't ever had to do any of those tasks and he shouldn't be expected to start doing them now after so many years. Am I the asshole for telling him he's reasonable for our daughter during his time with her which is now preventing him from having 50/50 custody?

Editing because I forgot to add: I have been exceptionally careful to keep our daughter out of earshot of any verbal conversations around this and I don't let her play with my phone she won't stumble across any of the text exchanges. She loves us both and I dont want to be one of those parents that involves the child in adult matters. 

Second edit because it was brought to my attention I didn't say why us both scheduling and paying for the childcare time we need is possible. Childcare is through her school all year long. We can each have an account and the days needed are selected and paid for a month in advance. It's not a set schedule until then days are paid for.

1gan8yx,AITA for getting my sister and girlfriend the same birthday present? ,"My girlfriend and sister have birthdays in the same month, so I went shopping for their birthday presents at the same time. 

They both like perfumes and both have similar preferences in perfumes-- sweet, edible, gourmand--and I found a perfume that captured the vibe and did it really well. I knew they'd both like it, so I bought two bottles, and gifted one to each. 

My girlfriend thinks it's weird to give the same perfume to both your sister and your girlfriend. I think that I got a gift that I knew each of them would like and enjoy, and that my thought process was that if they happened to be the same perfume, oh well.

1g5akaw,AITA for refusing to lend my best friend money after she started dating the guy I had a crush on?,"I (24F) have been best friends with “Mia” (24F) for almost 10 years. Recently, I met a guy named Jake (26M) through a mutual friend, and I had a pretty big crush on him. I told Mia everything, from how we met to the fact that we’d been texting a lot. She always seemed supportive, telling me to go for it.



But about a week ago, I found out that Mia had started secretly dating Jake. When I asked her about it, she said she didn’t think it was a big deal because Jake and I were never “official.” That really hurt me, but I didn’t want to lose my best friend, so I tried to let it go.



Now, Mia has asked me to lend her $500 because she’s struggling financially. Normally, I’d help her out, but after what she did, I don’t feel comfortable giving her money. I told her I couldn’t do it, and she got really upset, saying I was being petty and letting my feelings about Jake get in the way of our friendship.



I’m now second-guessing myself because I’ve always been there for her, and she’s called me selfish for not helping when she needs it. AITA for refusing to lend her money after she started dating the guy I liked?
