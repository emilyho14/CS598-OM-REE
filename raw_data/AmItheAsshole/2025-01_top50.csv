1hukbx6,AITA for only getting a college graduation gift for my 28M son and not my DIL 28F?,"So I’m a 55F and my son who I raised as a single mother recently graduated from grad school. His wife my DIL also graduated at the same time and I have a special gift of a bit of cash just to my son because I’m proud of him as his mother and I feel a sense of pride since I raised him as a single mom. I figured my DIL had her own parents to gift to her. Well my DIL texted me saying she was very hurt that I only acknowledged my son (her husband’s grad) and not hers as she thought she was a part of the family as my DIL and they been together for a while. She said she didn’t expect the same amount of money of course but just a card or something. She said she felt like I overlooked all her hard work and only saw my son’s. However I don’t feel like I need to apologize or justify my choice in wanting to reward my son individually. 

I could be the AH for overlooking my DIL’s accomplishment and only acknowledging my son’s.",SetLongjumping5521,6514,3792,0.8600000143051147,0.7768145503994561,1736118834,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hukbx6/aita_for_only_getting_a_college_graduation_gift/,2025,1
1hs6t1j,AITA for telling my girlfriend that her friend is too ugly for my friend?,"I’ve (29m) been with my gf (28f) for the past 8 months and it has been amazing. I’ve met her friends and I really like them all, and she’s met my friends and they all got along great. We are all hanging out together for the first time this weekend. The issue is that my gf has told one of her friends, let’s call her Sue, that she thinks she would be perfect for one of my friends, let’s call him Mike. She has told her this multiple times, shown her pictures of him, and gotten her all excited. My problem with this is that I don’t think they are a good match at all. Mike is a very good looking guy, in great shape, is 6’2” and is a lawyer. He has always dated very conventionally attractive women. Sue is great and I really like her, but she is just not very conventionally attractive. She is overweight and just doesn’t put much effort into her appearance in general. 

My gf has mentioned this potential match to me a few times, and I’ve always just kind of brushed it off with a “we’ll see” or “you never know” hoping it would just fizzle out, but after we made plans to all hang out and after I found out she has been telling Sue about it, I felt like I had to say something to her. I didn’t want Sue to get her feelings hurt, and I didn’t want to put Mike in an awkward situation. I told my girlfriend I think she should not try to set them up together, and to just leave it alone, and if something happens between them, great, but not to push it. When she asked why, I said I just don’t think they are a comparable match looks wise, and that I think Sue would get her feelings hurt. I said I don’t think they’re a great match personality wise either, since he is super active and she is much more of a home body. This caused a big fight (our first real fight) where she accused me of thinking my friends were better than her friends, asking who else I thought was “ugly”, etc. I was genuinely just trying to avoid an awkward situation, but I might have made it worse. Should I just have kept my mouth shut and let it happen?

1htqwgu,AITA for booking a hotel in the same area as my son and dil’s trip that we didn’t get to go on?,"My son and his fiancée of six years go on a family trip every year with her extended family. From what my son tells me, they travel to different locations and rent an Airbnb that accommodates the 30 people who attend. For the past three years, they’ve gone during the holidays, and as a result, we rarely see them. My future daughter-in-law (DIL) and I have a good relationship, but I can’t say we talk much.

My son and his fiancée are planning a trip in March for spring break, and I asked my son when we might be able to plan a trip together in the future. He mentioned there might be enough room at the house they’re staying at. I told him that sounded great and asked him to let me know the costs for everyone attending. My 24-year-old son, 22-year-old daughter, and 3-year-old grandson also live with me, so we all planned to go.

A few days later, my son told me that we’d likely have to sleep on a couch or share one of the kids’ bunk beds if they were available. I assured him we’d make it work, and I sent him our share of the costs. I also told my kids, who were very excited—this would be their first vacation that’s more than a three-hour car ride away.

Last week, my son called and told me it wouldn’t work for us to join them after all, and he sent back the deposit. When I asked why, he explained that his fiancée didn’t feel comfortable with us coming. She was upset because I didn’t attend her engagement dinner last year to meet her side of the family, which she felt would make it awkward to share the vacation rental. She was also upset that I didn’t reach out to her directly to discuss joining the trip, leaving my son to relay the information instead.

I told my son it was fine, but I ended up booking a hotel about 15 miles from where they’re staying. I also told my son he didn’t have to worry about making time to see us. Now, my DIL is upset because she feels that we’re still somehow taking away from their trip.

1i7n5bg,AITA for hiding my expensive shampoo and conditioner from my friend’s guest?,"I (28F) share an apartment with my friend (34M). Last weekend, while we were away, he invited his female friend (Sarah) to stay over. When we got back, I noticed she had used most of my shampoo and conditioner without asking. I had splurged on these expensive products to treat myself. I also make a lot less money than my friend.

Today, Sarah came over again for a visit and asked to shower at ours before heading to a dance class. However, I had taken my expensive products to my room this time, leaving only my friend’s basic shampoo out for her to use. When she couldn’t find the conditioner, she asked my friend, who came to my room to ask me about it. I told him that she’s his guest, and it’s not my responsibility to provide spa products for her. My friend got mad and thinks I’m rude and petty. AITA?

1i6u3os,AITA for declining to invite a woman who has called herself ‘a total klepto’ into my home?,"I joined a Women’s Social Club 6 months ago because I’ve been struggling to make friends after relocating to a new-to-me city. It took me a while to warm up to the group and to connect with people I actually had anything in common with. I had to wade through a lot of botox parties and boozy brunches to find things I was interested in. But I did, and I started coming to group events fairly often.

I hang out most often with the women who like to read, do crafty things, bake, skywatch, etc. Among these women is one, I’ll call her Andea, who has made several comments about how she’s a total klepto. I think that she makes these comments to seem “cool” to the other people in the group.

I reached out to some of the women I see regularly at these events and invited them over to my place to watch a TV show we’d been talking about and do crafty stuff. They were excited and agreed to come.

Unfortunately, Andrea found out (I assume someone asked if she was going) and reached out to me to ask if she was invited. I considered this for a bit and then told her no, as I only had so much room at home. She didn’t believe me and asked me for the real reason, saying “I thought we got along” which yes, is true. 

I told her I’m not comfortable inviting a kleptomaniac into my home. That I’ve worked hard to have the things I have and it would be stupid for me to invite her knowing that she openly brags about it. 

She said ‘Okay’ very quietly. She then said “You’re painting me out to be some horrible criminal when you don’t even know anything about me.” 

I said that her being proud to call herself a klepto was all I needed to know. She said that I was a high school mean girl and ableist. I am unsure what the foundation for that statement is.

This unfortunately has spilled over to the group, which is frustrating. But what has me the most surprised is that there are so many people defending her and telling me that I’m out of touch and take things too literally.

1id64xi,AITA for calling ski patrol on a guy after he hit my son with his skis?,"My son (11M) and I (44M) recently booked a trip to go skiing in Colorado. It was my son's first time skiing, but he had seen a lot of skiing videos on YouTube, and he seemed really excited for the trip. We also live in Florida, so this is not the trip you can just go and do whenever you like (we are not rich). I grew up in Utah and I loved skiing when I was younger, and I would say I'm an expert on the mountain. The first day goes all good, and my son really enjoyed skiing for the first time, even though he fell a lot, lol. I made sure to be as supportive and caring as possible, even when he was struggling, because I wanted to make this as fun an experience as possible for him. However, on the second day of skiing, he says he's finally ready to ski down the whole mountain, and so we take the lift to the top. Luckily, there was a way to get down the mountain while only staying on green level trails, so we took that way. 

My son is having a blast, when all of a sudden, this guy in his 20s careens into my son from behind going on insane speeds, wiping them both out. My son immediately started crying and came running to me after he got his skis off, and once he calmed down, he ran to the lodge where my wife was, and she decided to take him to the doctor's office. I immediately confront the guy for being so reckless, and he simply says that I should have been paying better attention to my kid, and then he rode off. That was the final straw for me, and I called the ski patrol number in the app and told the guy the situation and what the skier was wearing, and they told me they would find him and kick him out. Later on, I saw him getting escorted out of the park by two ski patrol officers, and when he saw me, he immediately started cursing me out and calling me a horrible dad. I tried to ignore it, but now I'm second guessing myself if I overreacted.

1hxr5ew,Update: AITA for leaving my dad’s birthday dinner after overhearing my sister’s comment about my miscarriage?,"[link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/7nVIk1V4PJ)

Hi everyone, I want to thank you all for the support and feedback on my last post. This update is mostly about a few different conversations that I had.

I took your suggestions and called my dad, apologizing for leaving early. He completely understood. We talked a bit and he asked if we could go out to lunch this week because he missed seeing me, so we made plans.

Then, I talked to my husband and told him that I didn’t think I could’ve stayed and still thought leaving was the best thing for us. He apologized for invalidating my feelings and said he would’ve liked for us to spend time with family but not at the cost of my mental wellbeing. He offered to call my brother (not the one who texted me) to set up a playdate for our son with his kids so my son could see some of his cousins, which I appreciated.

Later, my mom called (I guess my dad told her we talked) and she apologized for taking so long to call, saying she felt ashamed and didn’t know how to talk to me. She said she wouldn’t have let Eva say that if they’d known I was there and that she didn’t mean it. Eva has been hormonal and frustrated, and my mom thought calling her out at that point would've just made things worse. She felt terrible for hurting my feelings. I thanked her for the apology but told her I needed more time before meeting her.

After this, Eva texted me, and I wanted to hear her out, so I called. She apologized a lot and emphasized that she didn’t mean it and regretted saying it, attributing it to the same thing my mom had. Apparently she and BIL also had a big fight about it when they got home, which delayed her talking to me.   
  
We had a long conversation, in which she confessed that she had a few early miscarriages before they even told us she was pregnant. But she felt she had to keep smiling through it, which made her slightly resent how I was handling my situation. I told her I was hurting and keeping my distance so she could enjoy her pregnancy. She felt bad for misunderstanding and thinking I was shutting everyone out. I assured her that this wasn’t the case; I hadn’t let anyone in, and with her being pregnant, it was tough for me. I wished her luck but told her I hoped she could understand why I didn’t think I could be there with her. She was sad but agreed.

We talked more, and by the end, things were better. I texted my family group chat with a long message about how I was feeling and why I would be taking space from meetups, because I feel I need it after this. While the apologies eased my mind and I can see myself forgiving them in the future, I am still hurting, and I think right now, I need to spend time with my husband and son and handle my grief with a professional.

Thank you all again for reading this, and I hope this answers your questions about what happened next. Hope you all have a fantastic day!",throwra_71839,10078,244,0.9800000190734863,0.4604408863126322,1736467119,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hxr5ew/update_aita_for_leaving_my_dads_birthday_dinner/,2025,1

1i2arp6,AITA for refusing to fund my boyfriends ‘genius’ idea?," 
I (F24) have been dating my boyfriend (M29) for 3 years, and while he’s always been a bit wacky I usually find it kind of endearing. This time however, he’s really outdone himself. A few weeks ago, he told me he had a “groundbreaking” idea that would “change humanity forever.” Entertaining him, I asked what it was. His answer? He wants to invent a new color.

Before we go any further it’s important to note we are both college graduates. I graduated in Biochemistry last year and my boyfriend in Philosophy a few years before, which makes this all the wilder I guess.

I tried to gently point out that colors exist as part of the visible spectrum of light, so unless he was about to discover some new wavelength, this might not be possible. But he waved me off, calling me “close-minded” and saying he was “enlightened in a way you’ll never be”

At first, I just nodded and let him ramble about his “vision.” But then he told me he needed funding to start his “research.” Specifically, he wanted me to give him $4,000 so he could buy “supplies,” including “advanced art tools,” a lab coat (because apparently, scientists wear them, so it would make him “feel smarter”), and—wait for it—a trip to the desert because he thinks the “pure sunlight” there will inspire him.

I told him absolutely not. I’m saving for grad school, and even if I weren’t, I’m not dropping thousands of dollars on his… whatever this is. He got mad, saying I didn’t believe in him or his “potential to revolutionize human perception.” He even accused me of being jealous that he had a “world-changing idea” and I didn’t. It got really heated and he ended up saying a lot of things about using my card as he knew the details anyway. For reference he’s been unemployed for a while now, whilst I’ve got a regular job. I ended up saying some things I do regret, but a lot of it was retaliation.

Now he’s sulking and telling everyone I’m “unsupportive” and “afraid of innovation.” His friends are backing him up, saying I should be encouraging his creativity instead of “crushing his dreams.” AITA for refusing to fund his quest to invent a new color?",Rich-Painter-9008,5714,1432,0.949999988079071,0.4316368553889452,1736983007,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i2arp6/aita_for_refusing_to_fund_my_boyfriends_genius/,2025,1
1ies40z,AITA for kicking out my mom’s boyfriend?,"When I was 17 my mom came into money.  She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad’s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister’s college and set up funds for mine.  She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house.

Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn’t pay anything but he did work.

When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn’t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it.  She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed.

Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey.

For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven’t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid.

He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for.  Until his current partner.  She’s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit.

I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom’s past relationship as an adult was pathetic.

I hollered for my mom’s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn’t know what he current thing thought but I wasn’t going to be disrespected in my house.  He wouldn’t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just “being kind” letting me stay.

First that isn’t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can.  He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn’t that’s on him.

I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn’t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week).

I really feel like my mom didn’t expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and  that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.",NotWillingToShare,8616,464,0.9800000190734863,0.4273211592294468,1738364783,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ies40z/aita_for_kicking_out_my_moms_boyfriend/,2025,1
1hts7rx,AITA for telling my sister that my nephew is NOT my baby? ,"My sister (23f) lives at home and has a 6 month old baby. She never moved in with her boyfriend because they live far from each other and neither of them wanted to compromise. Her baby daddy never ever comes around, he’s seen their son probably less than 30 days total of his entire life. And because of this my sister has been treating me (21f) and my mom as his other parent. She expects free childcare CONSTANTLY while she works and whatnot and gets very upset when I act hesitant about it for whatever reason. Because she doesn’t want to send him to daycare (she’d be eligible to get free childcare in our state but doesn’t trust it). 

And I love my nephew to death but these are MY child free, college years; I have been parentified and forced to play mommy for my little siblings for years, and just when they’re getting to the age that they don’t need me so much I don’t think I should be forced to step up and play mommy to another child who isn’t mine. Especially when I’m on winter break for the next couple of weeks and just want to enjoy sleeping in way too late and being lazy before I’m thrown back into full time college (this has been happening for 4 months at this point though). So when she asked if I’d watch him tomorrow I got a bit of an attitude but ultimately said yes. But to that she got snappy with me and was like “Why do you always act like you don’t want to do it?!” To which I got upset and responded “Because he’s not my kid and I shouldn’t be expected to do this all the time.” 

She got VERY angry at me and is now not talking to me at all, and is surely going to weaponize my nephew against me. And to an extent, sure I understand her anger: I know that you should be able to rely on your village and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong for not wanting to do this. But I am so tired of taking care of other people’s children all the time for free, even if I love the kids to death. I can’t tell if I’m being selfish or not, AITA here?

1hwvpht,AITAH for confronting my uncle on a $700 debt while he brags to his family about a surprise vacation to Maldives for his daughter as a Christmas present?,"Last September my uncle Daniel (43) came up to me (22) looking all stressed and asked if I could have a sit down with him as he needs a Favour. He begun to speak on how he was really on a rough financial spot, and he really had nowhere to turn to as he didn't have anyone to ask for a loan from and I was the only one left available.  Mind you I'm not rich or anything of the sort, I just happened to have the amount he needed at the time.

According to him it was a serious situation that he couldn't approach or tell other guys in the family, and the issue needed to be addressed soon. Without better judgement I lent him the cash after much insisting from him. We agreed on payment before December, and I didn't even ask for any interest on it. With lots of hugs and words, he took it and gave me his word on the paying it.

Fast forward and we are now at Christmas dinner at my grandma's house, and all that time I didn't give him any reminders or a checkup. I assumed he was late or something and he would let me know why at Christmas dinner because the larger family meets every year for that. He also didn't call or say anything to update on his situation and I just had to trust all was well. Now on a related side note for later, my cousin Aisha, (20, Daniel's daughter) recently underwent surgery a while back as she really had it tough for the whole of last year while she recovered from a traumatic back injury from an accident.

Everyone was enjoying their meal and suddenly my uncle stood up at the dinner table and called for attention for a speech. He began to speak on how his business took a really huge boost and long story short, how he has just cashed in a large profit from some deals. He looked at Aisha across the table and took out some brochure with some resort looking location and said it was a gift to her for her tough recovery from the incident. All I could see was Aisha visibly crazy excited. Someone asked what it was exactly, and Daniel said he was planning on taking Aisha and the rest of his family to the Maldives as a celebration on Aisha's accident recovery. Everyone was now happily cheering Aisha on her gift as it seemed it was something she always wanted to experience.

""You can afford all that but not repay my debt which you haven't said anything on,"" the words just slipped out of my subconscious mind as I looked at him straight in the eye. His words were ""why are you talking about that now of all places"". Now I was pissed, I reminded him Infront of everyone on the exact amount and I told him the fact on how he wasn't even communicating on repaying it. The entire family was in shock with dead silence as my mom hurriedly changed the subject to avoid an escalation of the situation. Later on, in the evening my aunt, grandma, and some cousins began to lecture me on how I ruined Aisha's moment after her struggles and embarrassed my uncle in the process.

They leave in a week, and he still hasn't paid or mention anything on the debt.

It’s not going to be a rager but I want it to be a fun night to let loose a little (lots of moms coming), laugh and have fun. A friend of mine just had a baby, her baby will be 1 month exactly day of party. It seems she thinks she should be able to bring her baby, however I am leaning towards sticking to my request of no children, which means she won’t be able to come. From what I hear, she’s upset and doesn’t think this is fair.  She wants to bring her baby. Now this may be selfish but I know that bringing the baby will impact the “vibes” of the party. The focus will be on the baby instead of enjoying our time together. I know that no one else there will obviously be offended or anything like that. I too am a mom, if I was in her shoes I would just not go and leave it at that NBD. And if I’m being really honest I want this day to be about my birthday, not her baby 😬😬.

So I knock on the door with no response, I knock a few more times then open the door to look in. She's a naked pooper, she passed out while pooping apparently and fell off the toilet onto the floor. Somewhere in all that she puked all over herself. So I'm left with a completely naked woman covered in puke, poop and pee. I try to wake my wife up but she's out cold, I try to wake my sil up but she's out cold. So I grab a bunch of towels, just do a quick clean up. Get the heavy stuff off of her, clean up the floor and made her a bed of towels so she didn't have to sleep on the cold tile, propped her head on a folded towel as a pillow and used a giant fluffy towel as a blanket. 

Here's why I'm told I'm an asshole. She was mad I let her lay in poop/puke all night. I should have picked her up and put her in the tub and bathed her. She was passed out drunk, I didn't think she wanted me touching her intimate areas. Where she replied that I have a wife and daughter, I've seen a vagina before and I've changed my daughter's diapers/baths so I know how to clean a vagina/butt/breast. She's only 100lbs so it would have been easy for me. My wife sides with me but the other women say that I should have cleaned her better. So am I an asshole? Would you want someone touching you while you're passed out?

1i983ij,AITA for accepting an invitation on my husband’s behalf that I knew he wouldn’t like and refusing to cancel it?,"My husband is a busy person but he’s not such a busy person that he can’t manage invitations from his family and friends if he wanted to. His family and friends act like I’m responsible for his social calendar, which I didn’t mind at first because I didn’t have anything better to do but I’m tired of being the one to have to say no to everything and it sucks having to deal with people trying to convince me to come to things when I know they only really care about my husband attending.

I’ve tried to get them to go to him directly but he just sends them back my way or ignores them so they come to me anyway. I’ve spoken to him multiple times about not wanting to be responsible for ‘our’ social calendar and he acts like he gets it but then never responds to invites so nothing’s changed.

So I’ve done something that you guys may or may not think is petty. My mother-in-law has asked for us to join monthly family dinners with her side of the family. I prefer her side of my husband’s family but my husband is closer to his dad’s side so we see them more. Usually, I wouldn’t accept an invite like this without checking with my husband but since she asked him first and he ignored her I decided to accept on his behalf.

The first dinner is on Sunday which is the day we were also supposed to have dinner with his grandfather on his dad’s side but he never told me that was happening and neither did anyone else (his dad’s side have a horrible habit of just assuming we’ll be at something because they’ve told us). Part of me thinks the dinner with his grandfather is a lie because I know he’s been avoiding his half-brother like the plague since he keeps asking him for an investment and his stepsiblings will be there.

My husband told me to cancel but I don’t want to because my mother-in-law was so happy when I said yes. Also, his sister will be there and I haven’t seen her in forever. I won’t stop him from cancelling if he really wants to but he’s turned this situation into a fight because I didn’t ask him first and now I don’t want to be the one to cancel. He’s basically said if we go to the first one he expects me to tell my mother-in-law this won’t be a regular thing but I think he should be the one to do that since I have no problem having dinner with them regularly.

1hs87xi,AITA for joking that I wished British people were real,"I seriously can't believe I'm asking this but here we go.

I was watching a comedic British show with my friend ""Carly"" and we were having fun and making jokes  and stuff like that. I said ""I love this show. I wish British people were real."" As a joke, obviously. It was supposed to be unserious and stupid but Carly gave me a weird look. She said that's a weird thing to say. I was taken aback because she's seen me make much more weirder jokes than that and I had no idea why she was hung up on this one. But I apologized and told her it was a joke and I obviously didn't think british people are not real. I followed up by saying that on a serious note I like British culture, otherwise i wouldn't be watching this show. She asked how I would have felt if she said Korean people weren't real (I'm Korean) I told her I would also take it as a joke as long as youre not offending me or my food or whatever. She scoffed and just kept watching.

I didn't know this joke could be insensitive. I mean, I know it's kind of a stupid joke, but I didn't know it could offend like that. She's not even British! So I'm doubting myself on whether this was offensive or not.

1hts6wj,AITA for refusing to watch my neighbor’s kid before school because she kept nagging me?,"I F35 am a stay at home mom with two kids “John” M10 and “Ava” F8. My neighbor “Zoe” F42 works full time and asked at the beginning of the school year if she could drop off her daughter “Sue” F9 an hour before school started twice a week. I agreed and was happy to help out a neighbor. However, things got bad pretty quickly.

My kids do not get along well with Sue and see entertaining her as a chore. Both of my kids enjoy sports, arts, and playing outside, while Sue is glued to her phone. Despite this, Sue pouts when my kids do their own thing instead of trying to engage her. Zoe called me a few weeks into the school year to nag me for having the kids walk/bike to school, saying it was unsafe and asking me to drive Sue. I told her no–if Sue was old enough to have a phone she was old enough to walk/bike to school. A week later, she asked me to cook real sausage for Sue in addition to veggie sausage I make for my kids (my husband and I don’t buy meat). I told her no–Sue could eat what I cook but if she wanted specific food she would have to prepare it herself. 

For the first semester of school, Zoe nagged me with similar requests. Don’t play songs with explicit lyrics, don’t let multiple kids on the trampoline simultaneously, watch the kids when they’re outside, etc. When I refused, she was respectful and would be like “sorry to bother you” but she still had new requests every week. At the end of the semester, I told her I was not going to make adjustments to our family lifestyle and inconvenience my family for the sake of her child. Sue’s safety was not at risk. If she was unsatisfied with Sue’s situation, there were plenty of other people in the neighborhood who could watch her. Zoe seemed really receptive, and I was hopeful that would be the end of her nagging.

When my kids got home on December 20th, I asked, “Are you excited for 2.5 weeks with no school?” and John responded “I’m more excited for 2.5 weeks with no Sue.” Ava nodded and giggled along. It broke my heart to know that they were more happy to get a break from Sue than school.

Just a couple of days ago, Zoe reached out to me thanking me for agreeing to watch Sue and asking if I could watch her a couple afternoons a week in addition so Zoe could have some “me” time. I told her this would no longer work–our kids did not mesh well and I didn’t want to deal with more inappropriate requests. 

I thought Zoe might be mad, but instead she just begged me to watch Sue at least one morning a week. She apologized profusely and said I could parent however I wanted to. This made me feel bad because she genuinely needed my help and did not know what she would do. I told her I knew I could and that her apology was too little too late.

My husband and kids stand by my decision, but some of the other moms think I should have been more accommodating, saying I’m selfish, that moms help moms and I’ll never know when I might need help. Does my refusal to help Zoe make me an asshole?

Update: Thank you for the responses. It was so validating to see that you support my actions. The moms in my neighborhood didn’t, but at least a few hundred strangers on the internet did. I want to address some common comments and hopefully provide reasoning as to why I initially agreed to help Zoe. In addition, there are some new developments I’d like to share

First, I want to give background. This shouldn’t change the verdict, but hopefully it makes you think I’m less of a doormat. Zoe is married but her husband works in a city 2 hours away and is hardly ever home, and Zoe herself works a demanding job with weird hours. They already pay a fortune for their nanny, so I was happy to lift some of the burden. She did not pay me. This may sound snobbish but my husband makes a lot of money, so an extra few dollars didn’t seem to be a huge deal. Plus, one of the things I enjoy most as a stay at home mom is getting to do these things for other families (so long as they are pleasant) and having a house full of happy kids. Not to get too personal, but I grew up in poverty with alcoholic parents. My parents struggled to put food on the table and our utilities frequently got shut off, so it was often the kindness of our neighbors that kept me fed, clothed, clean, and maybe even alive. So yeah in retrospect I shouldn’t have agreed to do so much for Zoe for free, and I have learned from my mistakes, but hopefully this can help you understand why I did it in the first place.

Now onto the story. One of the moms who is close to me “Jen” reached out asking what happened with Zoe. I thought everyone knew, but I recalled the events of the semester leading up to a couple days ago. Jen said that’s not what she heard. Zoe had told everyone that she paid me $100 an hour and that I let the kids watch R rated shows and eat candy for breakfast and I called her a “stuck up bitch” when she asked me not to. She told them my kids bullied Sue so relentlessly that she came home crying every day she came to my house, and that I encouraged said bullying. When Zoe complained about this to me, I supposedly denied it. To top it off, I demanded Zoe pay me $200 an hour or I would stop watching her “little brat.” I was horrified that Zoe was spreading this misinformation about me. I assured Jen that none of it was true, showing her receipts of my text exchanges with Zoe. Jen told me she believed me and promised to help me set the record straight. I just don’t know what to do because none of the moms will talk to me and all of the playdates John and Ava had scheduled were cancelled. I worry because even if we can convince everyone that Zoe is a liar, people will still be suspicious of me. My family has only lived in this town for a couple of years and Zoe’s family has lived here much much longer. I can take my reputation being tarnished, but I worry especially for my kids. I don’t want their friendships to be ruined by some girl who can’t accept my decision to not provide free childcare.",friendlyneighbor154,4654,440,0.9700000286102295,0.2557901225801871,1736035004,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hts6wj/aita_for_refusing_to_watch_my_neighbors_kid/,2025,1
1id7hka,AITAH for calling out My Uncle in front of everyone After making weird comments on my girlfriend's looks and being too touchy?,"So basically, at a family barbecue last weekend, my uncle (mid-50s) kept making creepy comments about my girlfriend Kate(21F) who I invited. At first, it was backhanded compliments like, *""Wow, you’re way too pretty for him,""* but then it got worse-*""I would have snatched you up back in the day,""* and *""Must be a struggle to compromise for me?""* He even joked about how my girlfriend must get hit on all the time and how I should *""keep an eye on her.""*

On top of that, he was being *way* too touchy, putting his hand on her lower back, touching her arm when he laughed, and even leaning in way too close while talking to her. My girlfriend was clearly uncomfortable but tried to brush it off. She told me privately that it made her uncomfortable, 

I confronted him in front of everyone, straight-up calling him a creep and telling him to knock it off in a loud way. He got defensive, saying he was just joking, and my mom told me I was out of line for embarrassing him like that. 

Some family members agreed with me, but others think I overreacted and should've handled it privately since everyone knows him as a joker and just loves making conversation which he is good at. Some male cousins of mine are insinuating I was jealous and exaggerating stuff because my uncle talked to their partners too and they didn't have any complaints like Kate.

My Uncle said he was just making jokes, and he didn't mean any of them, and he is really disappointed that I looked at him as that kind of guy

1i97bii,AITA - I rejected my BIL's child being a flower girl,"I (27F) am getting married this spring to my boyfriend (26M).
We have been planning our wedding for 2 years now and have been trying to get blessings from both sides of our families but only my family was supportive of our decision to get married.
While receiving racist remarks from my to-be in-laws, they disapproved of us getting married and wanted us to wait a while before settling down.

Since we weren't receiving full support, we decided to plan the wedding ourselves and finalized the details like date, venue, catering, etc. We are not and have not asked for any financial support and they have not asked if we need help in any aspect of the planning. I also asked a family friend's daughter (4F) to be the flower girl after the engagement and her mom agreed.

Fast forward about a year since the flower girl was confirmed: My boyfriend's older brother and his wife recently gave birth to a baby girl (let's call her Amy) and they have been badgering us about allowing their baby (will be 11MO by the time of the wedding), my fiancé's niece, be the flower girl.

My boyfriend and I pointed out that Amy isn't guaranteed to be able to walk by that time, and Amy's father responded by saying that he could carry her down the aisle. When we initially said 'no' to that idea (as I think it's weird giving the role of a flower girl to a child that wont be physically able to do any of the normal flower girl duties and it would look ugly having a toddler walk down next to an adult holding a baby), Amy's father and Amy's grandmother kept on badgering us with the same questions:

""Can Amy be the flower girl?""
""What color theme is your wedding? We'll buy a dress for Amy.""
""Since Amy is our first and only grandchild, it's tradition for our family for her to be flower girl""

AITAH to reject Amy as the flower girl??? 🥲

Here is some context:
Amy's father and my boyfriend have two other siblings
Amy is currently 7MO and cannot crawl or sit up unassisted.

1icg6ll,AITA for making my husband leave work to return my keys,"I feel so awful about this, but my husband has a habit of forgetting/ignoring things I say. I WFH and am always there to unlock the front door for my husband when he gets back from work, so the couple of times I’ve needed the car, I get very annoyed that he’s taken the house keys attached to the car keys with him. 
This has happened a few times, he’ll lock all the house doors in the morning and go off to work with the car keys so I can neither leave the house nor drive anywhere. 
So I made sure we have two sets of keys and the second pair must always be on the console table for emergencies. The problem is my husband started keeping the emergency keys in his work bag and if he took the car anywhere, I was again locked in the house. This recently happened again when my family was coming over and they stood at a locked door while I searched the house for his work bag. 
Today I woke up very unwell and wanted to run to the chemist between meetings and pick up a book I had on hold at the library, when once again, my husband has taken the car keys. What made me so angry was that I’ve told him this a million times and I could have had a massive emergency. He was so calm and apologetic on the phone and but that just made me angrier. I’m sick of him never listening.  
So I lost it and demanded he come home immediately and drop the keys back because I need to go to the chemist. He started apologising and saying he has a meeting at work about to start, but I told him this is not a discussion and I expect him back home right now because I’m sick of repeating myself. 
He said he’s on his way back but I feel so awful for stressing him out while he’s at work and making him take a 40 minute journey back.

Keep in mind, I have gained a bit of weight since the last time they have seen me and I’m quite out of shape and struggling to keep up when we start the practice.

To begin the warm up, we had to dive off the blocks, my dive was really slow and sloppy as I haven’t practiced for a while.

We get out of the water for the coach to explain the main set and the coaches assistant (I think she’s 38F but idk for sure) says “it’s a pity your dad couldn’t have died a little later to save you from this practice” and she starts laughing and I’m fuming at this point. I tell her to PO and to not talk about things like that and I left early. My mum has called the coach and told him that what was said today was unacceptable, and that she thinks it’s disgusting that an adult who I should view as an authority figure to trust and look up to would say such things.

So, he got the semi-FT job at this landscaping company in the middle of July.  Everything was going well until fall.  He decided not to go to technical school or college.  Well, school isn’t for everyone.  The problem I have is that since the end of October, he hasn’t been working hardly at all.  We live in the Midwest, so there is no lawn mowing or landscaping after October.  So, right now he is working even less hours at the restaurant and maybe shovels snow and snow blows once or twice a month.  In the meantime he is laying around playing video games, hanging out with friends and basically being lazy.  My boyfriend does not charge him rent or utilities and allows this behavior.

I have two sisters, Macy and Penny. We grew up close— but with no brothers I felt excluded. My sisters would go on ‘girls trips’ and I wasn’t invited. My father isn’t in the picture, so mostly mom would leave me with grandma. Sisters and brothers are different: Penny and Macy fight, but they always make up.

 Penny is a lesbian and as a gay man we’ve bonded more as adults. Overall I love both my sisters even if the relationships are painful.  

About seven years ago, Macy married her fiance Michael. Penny was her maid of honor and Michael asked me to be a groomsman. Her wedding party included our female cousin, but also Penny’s partner Joanne (26F). Max and I were together but he was not in the wedding. I barely knew Michael and all his groomsmen were strangers. I told my sister that I would rather support her on her wedding day, but she said that “isn’t the way things are done.” She was right, but I saw no reason why it needed to be gendered. I should have stood with my family. 

She was the bride, so I didn’t bother her about it again. 

I was excluded from everything leading up to the wedding. I missed the bridal parties, dress selection, and bachelorette activities, not to mention the fact that day I had to leave my house and get ready at her fiancée’s hotel because she didn’t want any men around while she was getting ready.

Two years later Penny married Joanne. Of course Macy was the maid of honor but I also got to be a ‘brides man’ and was with her every step of the way. Partners were excluded on both sides. 

Before the wedding, Macy kept making snide remarks about how I didn’t belong there. There were no “bachelor parties” but I think Macy thought without a groom men shouldn’t be in the wedding. I WAS invited to Penny’s bachelorette party much to Macy’s chagrin. 

Now Max and I are marrying and we weren’t going to have a wedding party— but Max insisted because he’s close to his brother Marshall. When I made Penny my maid-of-honor Macy was offended. When I told her that she was going to stand with Max and Marshall because my best friend Kohl is going to be in it, she was furious! 

Macy said she needed to be there for her “baby brother’s big day” and felt slighted. I told her that if I had to stand with strangers, she had to. Besides, we needed even numbers

My mother took her side when she complained and even my grandmother called me spiteful. Angry, I shouted that if Macy had a problem she needn’t come. Should I relent and let her stand with me? I feel like this is a total double-standard because when Macy was married the answer was “it’s her wedding.” Am I the asshole?

1i5ac68,AITA for asking my bf to wash his sheets before I stay over,"Ok so here’s the situation: 

By bf and I have been dative for 9 months and our relationship is thriving, except for this one thing. First to give a little background, my bf works as a landscaper and he is pretty dirty when he gets back from work. For some reason he doesn’t like to shower when he gets home and usually takes a shower in the morning before he goes to work (take note I said before). Anyways, the first few times that I stayed over I noticed that his sheets were kind of brownish and I kept feeling what seemed like gravel or pebbles on my skin while I slept. 

Additionally I don’t think that he washes his sheets frequently in the first place, so they just kind of build up grime and dirt. I wasn’t too sure how to approach the situation… I didn’t want to tell him to shower because that felt rude or like I was insulting his hygiene, so instead I asked him if I could wash his sheets for him. 

I kind of thought that he would get the message after that, but he didn’t. So last week I texted him and asked if he could do a load of laundry and put his sheets in there before I came over. He responded with:

“K this is getting weird, if you think that my bed is so dirty you can just come over and do it yourself”

Anyways I don’t really want to have to be his mom or whatever and wash his sheets for him all the time just so that I don’t have to sleep with rocks exfoliating me while I sleep, but I also don’t want to tell him to go and shower cause that’s rude asf, especially if I have to tell him every goddamn day.

1i97e0f,AITA for how I called out my wife’s behavior?,"I’m (28M) having a fight with my wife (28F) about a work incident.

For context, we’re college sweethearts going on 5 years of marriage. We have a daughter (3F). I always felt we were a good team.

My wife’s an attending physician who previously was the Chief Resident at her hospital. She’s a consummate pro but has zero bedside manner.

She’s currently under investigation for creating a toxic work environment. There are multiple HR reports. The complaints are adding up.

It blew up after she treated a patient and their son harshly and with condescension.

She was supervising a couple of residents while also examining a patient who kept questioning her about the necessity of a lab test. My wife didn’t take it kindly.

She asked for everyone who went to med school to raise their hand. When neither the patient nor their son did, she declared, “Anyone whose hand isn’t raised can stop talking.”

The son spoke up, but my wife told him she’s not here to be liked, and as soon as she’s done helping his mom, they won’t have to see her again.

They reported my wife. It’s the latest in a long line, and someone on her staff confirmed the complaint.

The hospital’s new Chief Medical Officer has made it clear he’s tasked with changing the hospital’s culture and that arrogance and indifferent bedside manner will no longer be tolerated. He told my wife he’s not debating with her.

I found out what happened when we were talking about our day. I expressed that I didn’t agree with what she did. You can’t talk to people any way you want.

She said patients Google search, then believe they can self-diagnose. She doesn’t care about patient satisfaction surveys and prefers to tally the outcomes of her work.

She feels that as her husband, my full support should be with her. I told her I do support her, but the reports aren’t baseless, and there are times she shuts herself down emotionally and comes across as cold.

She said, “Great, now you think I’m a bitch too.” I tried telling her I would never think that of her, but she was done talking with me.

I didn’t mean it that way. I was just trying to convey how it might be for others. Sometimes she’s unapproachable, and it can be intimidating.

I don’t condone her actions that led to the reports, but I believe she means well. There’s a whole other side of her not many see outside of me. Even with our daughter, she’s more closed off. She has a softer and very compassionate side.

I’ve seen how much she cares about her patients. She’s up late countless nights researching nonstop to ensure they’re getting the best care and making sure her staff are vigilant.

I think she snaps because she does care deeply, but she won’t admit it, so she covers.

This new CMO isn’t messing around. Being a great physician isn’t enough to protect her anymore.

This whole thing is a mess. Now I’m in a fight with my wife, and it’s not fun feeling. Communication is failing.

I had the best intentions in saying what I did, but after my wife’s strong reaction, I’m not sure anymore.

1i7lxmq,AITA my asking a bridesmaid to choose a different dress for my wedding?,"I 33F am greeting married in March. It's gonna be an indoor ceremony with about a hundred people. It is decided that all the bridesmaids will preferably wear the same dress and if that's not possible everyone will wear the dress in the same color. 

I have a total of seven bridesmaids. My husband also has seven groomsmen. 
We went to one of the bridal stores to pick out their dresses. After looking at all the colors and considering the choice of flowers for the ceremony, we decided lavender was the perfect color for the bridesmaid dresses. 

One of the bridesmaids is plus size. She picked out a cute dress but it was low cut in the chest area. And since she is big in the chest area, the dress was very revealing on her and in my opinion showed way too much of her cleavage. 

Now my in-laws and their family are very conservative people. It's no way my right to tell people on how to dress but I felt that if she wore that dress on my wedding, she would have drawn unnecessary attention towards her and I did not want any kind of drama on my wedding. 

I politely conveyed my concerns to her and asked her to pick out another dress. This is when she got furious. She pointed out that many of the other bridesmaids are getting a similar dress with a deep neckline. She accused me of fat shaming her and singling her out due to her being heavy in the chest area which is not her fault. She did not get that dress but now isn't talking to me and has threatened to pull out of the wedding altogether. 

I truly didn't want to hurt her feelings but I feel my concerns are valid as well. 

AITA?

1i8g3sp,AITA for not paying for my fiancé’s mom’s funeral?,"!Small update! Thank you everyone for all your comments! They really opened my eyes. No plans are set in stone at the moment that was just the estimate they gave him for the service. After talking to him tonight and explaining that I will NOT be footing the bill for any sort of big expensive funeral, he left the apartment, after a long argument, to stay with his grandmother and basically hasn’t spoke to me since. We don’t have any combined finances/accounts so at this point I’m just over it and he can stay gone for all I care. 

New to Reddit so forgive me for any formatting issues. To make a long story short my (31) fiancé's (35) mother recently passed. She was never really in his life (abandoned him at birth) and l've only met her one time in the 8 years we've been together. Recently she had come back into his life and they were on civil terms. We got news from the hospital that she had died and they immediately wanted to know what funeral home we wanted to send her to and of course my fiancé decides he's obligated to figure all of this out since his other siblings are MIA or incarcerated. I recommended to him we just do something simple and keep it on the cheaper side since no one else will be helping financially and he doesn't have any savings either she also didn't have any kind of life/burial insurance. Well today he surprises me after work with a 10k bill that he expects me to pay the majority of out of my savings because he can't afford it. I will admit I did help pay for his dad's cremation multiple years ago but it wasn't near the cost of what he's wanting to do now. We just recently moved into a more expensive apartment and at this point a 10 thousand dollar funeral is just not on the table but he won't budge.

1i1gqln,AITA for not hiding Tampon Trash at work,"I started my period earlier today while at work. No big deal, I put in a tampon and threw the wrapper and applicator into the mostly empty, medium sized trash can (no lid) without thinking twice about it. Then I just got back to my job.

Two hours later, the only other woman on this floor came into my office and told me I had left the tampon wrapper and applicator “out in the open” and that “anyone could see that.” She also said I “need to be more discreet because it is a mixed bathroom.”

I immediately thought her comment was rude, but a friend pointed out she might have thought she was helping by letting me know. Still, I don’t think there’s any need to hide perfectly normal trash. If it were an actual used tampon, I would wrap it for sanitary and smell reasons, but this was just small bits of plastic in the trash can. I grew up in a house full of sisters, and my fiancé is very chill about menstruation. I’ve heard of men being weird about periods, but I’ve never personally experienced it.

Another friend suggested I go to HR to make a statement and verify what’s expected, but I feel like that’s over the top. I’m more inclined to just fume about it for the rest of the day and move on without changing how I throw away things.

TLDR: I don’t hid my tampon wrapper and applicator in trash at work. ",Olive___Oil,1438,509,0.9300000071525574,0.12822325699236375,1736889500,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i1gqln/aita_for_not_hiding_tampon_trash_at_work/,2025,1
1huj9e2,Update - AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding?,"My husband and I just recently celebrated our first anniversary, and I was thinking about all the dress code drama when I remembered this account and thought it would be fun to give y'all a little one-year update!

After I made my original post, my husband and I decided to contact my sister and parents and have a sit-down discussion about the situation. He offered to take everyone out to eat, and we had this really long discussion about my sister and my relationship.

My sister said she made a promise to herself never to let that happen again, and that if I wanted her in my life, I needed to be a normal person. My husband told her that if she was going to keep humiliating me for something I did as a child, then she wasn't a normal person either. It became a bit chaotic. My dad took our side, and said my sister's taking things too far. My mom took my sister's side, and said that, since I have NPD, I'm not capable of real change and if they ever give in at all they'll be hurting my sister. It ended with my sister calling my father an enabler and threatening to cut him of. It wasn't a great dinner overall.

What surprised me is my sister's husband. She called me the next day at his recommendation, and we talked for a long time. She told me that she doesn't want to feel like ""a side character in the (my name) show,"" and that was how it was for all our childhoods. I told her that I feel like I'm not allowed to have meaningful relationships with any of our family, since she restricts what I say and do and wear around them. I pointed out that she controls my clothes for like every family event, and this is my wedding, and she admitted that was a good point. Eventually, she agreed to attend the wedding in a really cute black and white checkerboard dress and leave if it became too much.

The wedding itself was incredible. It was the second-best day of my life so far and my sister said she was genuinely happy for me. I felt like a princess in a fairytale the whole day, and my husband was the handsomest prince in the universe. The whole thing was under the stars, it was perfect. I could talk about it forever, but character limits. As a wedding gift, my sister told me that she was going to start letting me wear what I liked at family gatherings, and talk about my accomplishments, AND talk about myself when it's just me and her a little. And she has, and it's been great. The only better gift I got that night was my husband himself.

This past year has been the best of my life, and I genuinely feel so much better about life and family these days. I'm a girlmom now, and I'm so glad my daughter gets to know her aunt and cousins too. I'm even allowed to babysit for my sister sometimes!

TL;DR: Everything really worked out, and it was a lot because this place helped me have confidence that I wasn't wrong.

1ice5im,AITAH for moving out of my boyfriends over salsa?,"Hey guys! So I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years and he's absolutely wonderful. We're both in college and we live together with a couple other roommates. The place is my boyfriend's mom's vacation house and we all pitch in for rent. Every week my boyfriends mom stops by. I work at a restaurant so I always get free chips and salsa to take home. My boyfriend loves spicy things so I always grab him spicy salsa and I'll grab myself regular as I can't handle spice. 

Now here's where it gets weird.. I've been coming home and go to grab my salsa and I notice that all of the salsa has been put into one container. This has been happening for MONTHS and results in me being unable to eat it. After asking everyone in the house including my boyfriend ""who's been doing this"" everyone was in denial about it. 

Just a couple weeks ago I decided to get a security camera to see who's been messing with me and my salsa. Guess who is on the camera mixing the salsas together? HIS MOTHER. So she's been showing up while everyone is gone, looking through our fridge and pulling out all sorts of items and going into our cabinet and getting a bigger container and putting the salsa together. I was not okay. 

For the longest time I've been thinking it was my boyfriend messing with me, needless to say after accusing him for a long time, this led to a huge argument about how weird his mother is for coming into our space and messing with our stuff. 

She does this every time she comes over and I've had enough. So I told my boyfriend to figure out why she's doing this. He calls her and she says she's making space in our fridge and she is not going to stop. So I'm now sitting here with all of my stuff packed and ready to get the heck out of here but my boyfriend says I'm being an ass about all of this

1ht0lj8,AITA wife wants me to choose her over my friends,"So recently my friends brought up the idea to go skiing and we were thinking about going to Europe since lift passes are somewhat cheaper over there. I brought up the idea of my wife coming along and then later they decided it was going to be a boys trip. I let her know of this and she immediately got angry. She said that she really wanted to go and its not fair and that she would spend an equal amount of money on trip for herself. She also said that her feelings were hurt. I said I was sorry and I advocated for her to come but I Ultimately cant invite her to a group event that they wanted to be just the guys.

 After she was done guilting me for still wanting to go I just said that I didnt want to go anymore. this has happened on multiple occasions where my friends have wanted things to be just us and no significant others and she gets upset. I told he I didnt like how she puts me in a position where it seems like I have to choose between her and my friends. She said that I should put her as number one priority over my friends which i don't think is fair. Ideally I would like to please both but sometimes obviously that cant happen. 

  
she has now threatened to not come home after work to even talk about it. I feel like she is being childish and its not fair for me to have to prioritize her over my friends I should be able to compromise and try and make both parties happy as each are important to me.

1i31gj7,AITA for expecting my stay at home husband to do the stay at home duties?,"This is my first time posting so sorry for any mistakes. My husband ""Jack"" (33M) and I (28F) have a toddler together and have another one on the way. He's a stay at home and I work full time. I'm out of the house the majorty of the day while he's home with the toddler. 

Jack doesn't do anything. He never sets an alarm to get up with the toddler. I do. He sits in the living room until our toddler's nap (which varies every day) then goes to the basement to play his video games. Our toddler will sleep anywhere from 2 to 3 hours. Then once our toddler wakes up, he gets her, makes dinner, and maybe gets one chore done around the house. Almost every day he does this. There are some days when I'm pleasantly surprised. 

I've talked to Jack multiple times about keeping the house cleaned, but he claims it's not fair that I don't have to do anything (which isn't true). If the house is kept up on, I do dishes, laundry, and meal prep on my days off. Sometimes I'll bake too. I'll also be on toddler duty. However once he lets the house go, I don't do anything other than clean the areas my toddler is in so she's not affected by it because she deserves a clean house. 

I have (almost) gotten the house completely cleaned 3 times now, and he lets the house go. I've tried splitting chores, but again, it's hard when I work full time and I'm out of the house the majorty of the day. My job has me on my feet all day and some days are harder than others.
 
I tell Jack all the time (and have proven it sometimes) that if the roles were reversed, I'd have the house cleaned for him. Jack claims that's not true. He claims it's my fault that the house is trashed because I should do more, yet I work full time because he didn't want to work, which I supported and made more sense financially. I have also been really tired and just want to sleep due to my pregnancy, but Jack gets mad if I don't wake up in the morning, even though I let him sleep in most mornings.

I know how Reddit can be, which is why I didn't want to post, but I'm at my wits end. We literally had another fight about the house being trashed and instead of helping me clean like I asked, he's now working in the garage. (Jack will literally find other things to do other than clean the house. For example, if there's a task that needs to be done, he'll take all day to do it, even if it's an hour long job).

1i2zpkb,AITA for telling SO I dont want him to have more custody of his son,"I started dating my SO 2 yrs ago. I became pregnant with our daughter after 13 mos. After finding out we were pregnant, we bought a new house with more space. Ironically, I got laid off around the time we moved. Luckily, I found a new job. 2 mos after I gave birth, my SO purchased the home next door for his mom. He sees it as an “investment opportunity” & MIL will be there to babysit when I am at work, which I am thankful for. However, I had concerns about our privacy & about the huge life adjustment that is his mother living directly next door. I have recently returned to work—which has been hard as a FTM who is BFing, I am the primary caregiver (SO works in the medical field and isnt home that much). SO has addiction issues (alcohol). It has caused huge strain on our relationship & on me. He isnt very reliable due to the alcohol.

SO has a toddler son from a one night stand. For the duration of the kids life, he has weekly visitations on Sundays for 6 hrs. Whenever we do have him, “MIL” is present 90% of the time. Which I have justified with the fact that she doesn’t get to see him otherwise. “MIL” is all too willing to change his diapers, prepare his food, baths, play with him, etc.. SO doesn’t do any true caretaking for the son—just plays with him. BM filed a custody/child support case 15 mos ago, so the legalities of that have been unfolding simultaneously with the rest of the chaos.

The court hearing is finally happening this month. I was shocked to find out that SO is trying for 50/50 custody with everything going on, & with how little he has been involved thus far. It seems like SO only wants 50/50 to “one-up” BM because of the addiction tactic she used. He has no DUIs or legal issues so she wouldn’t be able to prove that he is unfit. That said, it seems like he would have a fair shot at 50/50. I have expressed to him that I cannot take another huge life change in this short period of time & that I need time to adjust to new job, being a new mom, having MIL move in next door, & we need to get his alcoholism under control. He has agreed to go to therapy for the drinking so hopefully we are taking steps towards his sobriety. However, I feel that until he does that, & until we can fix our fractured relationship, adding another kid into the mix is just going to exacerbate the issues we have.

In summary, AITA for not wanting custody of his son? I would be more open to it down the road, but right now I am at my wits end. I dont want to care for someone elses kid whenever he hasnt been making me feel like its worth it. If he were being a better partner to me, I could justify it more. I really think we need to fix our relationship first, after all, that is what is supposed to remain whenever the kids are grown and out of the house.

I do care about the son. I just feel like now is not the time to be asking for more custody, & it seems really inconsiderate to continue to add things to my plate when I have vocalized that I am overwhelmed.

1hyfs4u,AITA I refused to keep loaning a roommate money for dress clothes for a funeral ,"I’m 38 year old physically disabled male currently living in a group home until I can regain my mobility and independence. Over the past year of so I’ve developed a friendship with another resident who isn’t great at managing their money. I’m the type of guy who likes helping people and people go to seeking advice or at least support. Over that time I loaned him about $600. He’d make some payments but often ask for that amount back within a week. I eventually put my foot down and stopped loaning him money. 

Then one of his three daughters was killed, then the second died from an illness. I gave him more money in loans and gifts to help him with these extraordinary times. I probably loaned him about $150 and gave him $100 for travel to see his family and help with a headstone and flowers.

A week ago his last remaining daughter’s son died of COVID and I gave him another $110 loan for travel and funeral expenses but he still wants more. I’m on fixed income right now and will probably be for at least the next year and a half. I’ve basically written this money off in my mind but I feel I can’t just keep throwing money to him. Right now he wants money for dress clothes or says he won’t go to his grandsons services. It’s tearing his daughter up and it feels like the emotional blackmail he’s used against me before when he keeps telling me a true friend would help.

My family say I’m in the right cutting him off but it hurts my heart. I just need people unconnected to the situation to give me their opinion.

Thank you all for reading this and your thoughts ",UgeChoppa,1760,173,0.9700000286102295,0.0976029543395796,1736545278,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hyfs4u/aita_i_refused_to_keep_loaning_a_roommate_money/,2025,1
1i00sin,AITA for not letting my wife's family stay at our house for a few extra months?,"So my wife's family came here for a better life from another country and they were staying at our house. It's a family of 5 and our house isn't the biggest and only has 1 bathroom, so that's 7 people in the house when it was only just 2. We gave them 120 days to find to find a job and a place for themselves. They all found jobs but they couldn't find an actual place to stay so they are renting bedrooms and now upset with us. It's like they weren't even trying to find a place to stay. It seemed as if they got too comfortable. If they were looking they would have asked me for help but they asked me maybe once but that's about it. They weren't proactive about it at all and now they are mad at us. I told my wife they had to leave and now everyone is upset with me. AITA?

1hw4fvn,AITA for telling my boyfriend he got to eat because I didn’t?,"
I (19f) and my boyfriend, (let’s call him K), (20m) have been together for a year and a half and living together for around 5 months. 

We’re tight on money right now (I’m the only one able to work due to my boyfriend’s disability.) and it’s been stressing me out. I was barely able to make rent and pay electricity, our WiFi got shut off, and I had barely any money to get groceries. 

K is also autistic and I believe (for many reasons) that he has ARFID. This is relevant, I promise. 

Having said that, K almost never find anything he wants to eat. A fair amount of the time I’m asking my mom for a little money so I can get him something he WILL eat, because if he doesn’t, his disability (not naming due to privacy reasons) will go from 0-100 very fast. 

Going into the issue that brought me here:


Last night K couldn’t find anything in the fridge he wanted so he asked his mom for $20 and I took him to Wendy’s. We couldn’t afford for us to both get a meal, so he got one and I didn’t. I ended eating a peanut butter sandwich and a couple of his leftover cheese fries that he couldn’t finish. I was a little upset, but with how routine this is for us, it didn’t hurt my feelings much. 

This morning he had pretzels and peanut butter. He was still hungry and couldn’t find anything else, so I looked at my rewards points and got him a burger from McDonalds. I got nothing because (once again) we have no money. But also; I’m hungry, I’m on my period, and I’m sick. Not the best time!

We got home, he ate, and I sat there. He didn’t say thank you, didn’t ask if I wanted any of it, nothing. So I got a little upset and he noticed and asked. 

Our conversation went as follows:

K: “You okay?”

Me: “Yeah, I’m alright. Just really hungry and we don’t have anything I can cook right now”

K: “yeah, I can second that.”

Me: “but you got to eat”

He looked at me and looked kind of angry. 


K: *silence for 5 minutes*

I looked at him and he looked upset, and I realized I might’ve been a little harsh. 

Me: “I didn’t mean to make you feel bad, I’m sorry if I made you feel that way.”

K: “well it felt like you did.”

Me: “I didn’t mean to, but at the same time, is it not true?”

And then nothing after that. He just got on his phone and stopped talking to me. 

I genuinely didn’t mean to make him feel upset or any type of way. It’s just frustrating having to be the only one working and providing for both of us and getting no acknowledgment for it. Maybe that’s egotistical of me to say, but I just want to be appreciated a little more. I don’t mind buying him food, if it’ll make him eat something I have no issue. But he shows no gratitude for the things I do for him, then when I make a point of it, this is generally how it goes. 

Rant over though, I just want a little insight on if I’m doing something wrong or if I was insensitive.
