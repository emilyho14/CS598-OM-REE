1e43g5t,"CMV: If Donald Trump wins in 2024, his administration will take every measure available and necessary to ensure that Democrats never have a fair shot at winning a presidential election again. ","Apart from Trump and co. outright saying as much, apart from the championing of Jan 6th rioters, apart from his hundreds of ties to Heritage Foundation officials, apart from the vengeance he's looking to inflict on those who wronged him - it would still be painfully and abundantly clear to anyone with a pulse and a smidgen of intuition that Donald Trump taking the White House is end game for the hopes and prospects of Democrats. 

With Thomas and Alito conveniently deciding to step down during this period, the Supreme Court can act as Trump's vessel to achieve anything he wants. Their recent ruling already establishes as much. Four years is too much time to establish a stranglehold on democracy that will have its grips on this nation until we've torn ourselves apart from the inside out. 

If someone could guarantee me that a Democrat would have a fair shot at winning the White House in 2028, I could genuinely breathe again. I'd hang on for dear life during the next four years, but at least I know that I still some agency as a citizen. I just can't help but foresee any semblance of that agency disappearing the second the election is certified for Trump.

1ebsfmk,CMV: Its totally valid for queer people to feel uncomfortable flying Palestine flags alongside Pride flags or at Pride events.,"I think its totally valid and fair for a queer person to feel uncomfortable with the idea of flying a Pride flag alongside the Palestinian flag at events or rallys. As such they shouldn't be shamed or anything for voicing this. I think this for the following reasons:

1. It is well known Palestinians by and large are anti LGBT, as such its totally fine to feel uncomfortable promoting such a group at whats meant to be a pride event. After all, said group is against you.

2. It's fine to not want to be associated with another movement you don't fully agree with. Some supporters of Palestine go fairly extreme with outrigt supporting Hamas or spreading outright antisemitism. Its fair for anyone to not want their flag flying alongside another flag they may disagree with itself, or disagree with elements of.

3. It's fine to want pride marches and events to actually focus on Pride. Attaching other social causes to all of them just kinda dilutes the message and energy. Its totally fine for someone to prefer focusing on Pride Flags and the Pride community first and foremost; and thus wanting to avoid the inclusion of other flags.",The_Naked_Buddhist,2683,2259,0.75,0.7803643301654021,1721906626,/r/changemyview/comments/1ebsfmk/cmv_its_totally_valid_for_queer_people_to_feel/,2024,7

I remember seeing John McCain comforting his supporters after the 2008 election; telling them “it will be ok.  Obama is a good man, and he will be do great things for our country.”  What happened?  How did we get to this point; when the “best” picks are an almost-literally decaying old man, and the man who actually tried to coup the government (do not come at me with your bullshit justifications, trumpers.  Trump led an insurrection on the capital.  This is an objective fact, and you are just fucking wrong if you disagree.). The 2024 election is ridiculous, and shameful to American history.  I’m at the point, where I think America is just done; nothing will ever change.  We are doomed to keep doing this overly-dramatized, two-sided caricature of a constitutional republic forever.

1dx9e4e,CMV: It is wrong to refuse service to Israeli tourists solely due to their nationality.,"There was a video uploaded to r/PublicFreakout and various other subreddits purportedly showing a restaurant in Vietnam having a confrontation with an Israeli tourist. While I agree his behaviour in the video and the context behind it paints him as being a bad-faith actor, I was somewhat and disturbed by the sentiment shown in the comments.

A lot of people in Israel are against the continuation of the war. In fact, there have been constant protests against Netanyahu and his government for prioritising it over other means of freeing the hostages. It should go without saying that not all citizens supp kj
Itbzl
G  ort the actions of their government. This is true everywhere, whether in Russia, China, or any other dictatorship like Iran or Saudi Arabia. Many of which commit even worse human right abuses and are rightfully condemned. Would it be right to discriminate against a tourist from such a country? No, and even if they are in support of their government tons of tourists with objectionable views are served regularly without any problems.

If the tourist was the aggressor and had incited the confrontation it would be right to refuse service to him. But the comments heavily plied that it would be correct to refuse service to all Israelis. I cannot see this as anything other than discrimination based on nationality. It might not be racist as nationality aren’t races, but it would certainly be wrong. And when criticizing someone for their (geo)political beliefs, one should not extend their criticism to all members of a nationality or religion. “Fuck Israel” is often heard due to the actions of Netanyahu’s government, but “Fuck Gaza” is never said even though the comparably vile Hamas is in control of Gaza. To me both would be too blunt.

1e8tr61,CMV: Trump is too old to be elected President,"A major issue we saw unfold over the past few weeks is the public coming to terms with the very difficult and complicated reality that the President's age was beginning to impact his ability to be reelected given the doubts that he was too old to remain President. 

Now that we've all seen the risks of electing people who are of the age when these serious physical and mental barriers to effectively leading the country, I believe Trump is now under the microscope to prove that he's not too old, and I don't think he'll be able to survive that scrutiny. Generally, uncommitted voters have been deeply displeased by the fact that the last 8 years and the current election cycle have been dominated by presidential leaders/ candidates who were born in the 1940s.

1dykazg,"CMV: It is completely reasonable for Europeans to be concerned about the influx of migrants from Islamic countries, given the laws and culture of these countries and the beliefs of many of their citizens","I live in the United States, so I'm no stranger to fights over border security. But while I understand concerns about the number of people entering the country and whether we have the resources and economy to give them what they need and also provide for our citizens, I've never understood the concern about the people entering. Mexico and the US are very similar in terms of values and attitudes, so while there may be a language barrier it's not as though illegal immigrants coming in from South America and Mexico are going to try to impose their own vastly different set of laws or rules on others or even believe that should happen. 

But when I look at Europe and the migrants entering Europe, that's completely different. Islam does have its own rules and laws and many citizens of these countries believe that these rules and laws were created by God and therefore they automatically transcend any legal system created by mere mortals. 

I'm not saying most Muslims feel this way. Islam has many different sects, with different views. But if even a small % of the migrants coming in- an unknown number I might add- believe that they have the right to impose their way of life on others because it's the word of their God, I completely understand why people would be concerned. 

I'm posting this CMV because I figure that if so many people feel a different way there could very well be something I'm missing or not understanding about this issue. And since I'm on the left where most issues are concerned, I'd rather side with the left on this one as well.

1e07xbp,CMV: Immigration to Europe from Africa and the Middle East will completely ruin the safety of most European cities,"Many European countries particularly ones in the EU are bringing in more migrants be it economic migrants or refugees from much African and Middle Eastern countries.  European countries such as Spain, Italy and others that are geographical entry points have difficulty securing their borders which only encourages more illegal immigration.

Unfortunately these migrants oftentimes do not respect the local culture and commit crime at all much higher rate than their native European counterparts.

They also tend to come to Europe with little to no marketable skill so they stay relatively poor, form their own enclaves, displacing the native French, Spanish, Italian communities and replace them with dangerous ghettos.  Since they are often stuck in these poor ghettos they do not assimilate to the local cultures even from one generation to the next meaning that all the problems the first generation brought will only be passed down to the second generation.

This only exacerbates the issue which even right now is a complete crisis.

1eem5bf,CMV: Voting should be mandatory and America should adopt the Australian voting model,"My view is thus, America should duplicate the Australian model for voting, which includes the following points.

- Election Day should be a federal holiday or moved to a Saturday.

- Failing to cast a ballot, even a blank ballot should result in a fine. This fine can be gotten out of with demonstrating a good reason you could not vote.

- Employers should be required to give anyone working on Election Day a reasonable amount of time off to vote. 

- Optional, but a part of the system that we should copy, even if not mandated by regulation or law. Fundraisers selling sausages at polling places, colloquial called “democracy sausages” a beloved part of the Australian voting culture.

It seems almost criminal to me that it’s not the norm for everyone in the world’s “bastion of democracy” to vote, and that it’s considered a point of concern to query and possibly fine everyone who didn’t cast a ballot.

My central view is that voting should be mandatory, the exact method by which we do this is not important to me, I was merely offering the Australian model as an option. I welcome being convinced why mandatory voting is a bad thing.

Black slavery was part of the culture of the time, and it was not right, and I think we can all agree on that. This is something that silently bothers me so I would like to hear the other side to see if I can understand it. If it's religious I could understand it, even when I'm not religious myself, because from a religious person's perspective, it is the indisputable word of God and cannot be doubted.

The argument I see the most often is that some women choose to wear the hijab, I'm obviously not talking about these cases, please refrain from bringing this up. 

I find the idea that women should cover themselves in restrictive clothing in order to ""protect themselves from lewd gazes and abuse"" ridiculous and kinda like victim blaming, why is the victim forced to forfeit her liberties instead of the abuser learning to not...abuse. And yeah I understand the Quran is also sexist with men, but then again, it doesnt make it right.

""It helps control how sexualized women are, and keeps beauty standards down to earth"" Again, the victim shouldnt change for the abuser's sake, and if the natural standard is men so lustful they can't see a woman's hair, I prefer sexualizing women.

""It's like women being required to wear a bra"" It totally isn't. Women, at least currently, \*choose\* to wear a bra for comfort, and sometimes even to make their breasts look better. And wearing a bra is not mandatory.

""It's the same as having to cover your genitals in public"" No, there is a biological imperative, mating instincts, that makes us specially attracted to genitals, also our primary genitals are not only for reproducing but also for excreting, so it's also considered unhygienic. And it can be disruptive.

""You just think that way because of traditional western values"" Yes, yes I do. I don't agree with with everything in traditional western values, but generally I do, and that does not, in any way, affect the validity of an argument, I stand by what I believe because I see logic in it, not because the TV or my parents told me to.

1. Almost all of her merch says Kamala. Clearly that's how she wants to be referenced.

2. BERNIE Sanders, Nancy PELOSI, Elizabeth WARREN, Mayor PETE, LEBRON James, Nikki HALEY, AOC, FDR, Katie PORTER. It goes both ways for both genders. They just go by whichever name is more unique in America (or on Buttigieg's case, what is more easily pronounceable).

In my opinion, sexism plays zero role in people referring to her as Kamala instead of Harris.

If Joe Biden were to pass away, Vice President Harris would immediately replace him right now. If Joe Biden were to pass away 10 seconds after the election was certified, the Vice President, who at this point, Joe Biden has intended to be Kamala Harris, would replace him. If Joe Biden were not the incumbent, and Kamala Harris was not already the Vice Presidential candidate, there would be an argument because there would be no clear line of succession, but there is in this case.

1dufxg2,"CMV: The Jan. 6 riot/insurrection at the US Capitol was absolutely a riot and an insurrection; the people partaking in it were absolutely seeking to overthrow the US government, and Trump's failure to send in the troops immediately makes him culpable.","The closest I've ever seen anyone come to making a point in defense of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol was the fact that it wasn't actually an insurrection, just a rowdy demonstration that got a little out of hand. To support this already stretched-as-hell argument, they point out that the vast majority of insurrectionists never did anything truly insurrection-worthy once they made it into the Capitol, but most of them just walked around aimlessly. One guy from Arkansas propped his feet up on Nancy Pelosi's desk. So on and so forth. But nothing even remotely resembling an ""insurrection."" 

But here's the thing: That doesn't actually matter what they physically did. What matters is that those people were INTENDING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT by stopping the certification of the election in favor of Biden and forcing Congress to certify the election in favor of Trump!

Sure, they may not have moved and acted with military-like discipline and cohesion. They may not have carried assault rifles and hid behind cover like actual soldiers. But all that proves is that the insurrectionists (and yes, I will call them insurrectionists) were *incompetent* at what they were trying to do. But that still doesn't detract from the fact that the vast majority of them were, indeed, trying to overthrow the government. They may have been as incompetent as the Wet Bandits, but I think we can all agree that the Wet Bandits' bumblingness didn't make them any less guilty of their crimes when they ultimately got caught at the end of the movie. 

Whereas apologists look at the footage of insurrectionists wandering aimlessly around the lobby like tourists and see them just being a wee bit disorderly, what I see is them running around like chickens with their heads cut off, trying to find something to do in furtherance of their goals. They were likely all thinking to themselves ""ok ... I'm inside the Capitol, so ... umm ... what do I do now?!"" Their end goal was still the overthrow of the government; they just didn't have a solid plan on how to make that happen. Again, that doesn't make them ""not insurrectionists."" That just makes them bumbling idiots. Big difference. 

Then, we have Trump himself. Yes, I'm aware the Supreme Court just declared he's above the law. But as far as my vote this November is concerned, I don't give a shit. The man stood back and allowed the rioters to do their thing for HOURS before finally enough pressure was put on him to send in the troops to stop it. 

And yes, I'm aware that he was never indicted for that part. No immunity necessary, he just never technically committed a crime when he failed to send in the troops immediately. DeShaney v. Winnebago County clearly says that ""failure to enforce"" isn't a crime in and of itself. 

But again, as far as my vote this November is concerned, I'd like you to take one guess as to exactly how many fucks I give about that legal technicality. 

Trump insisted that it was Antifa, not his boys, who were actually the ones doing the right. First of all, I don't give a shit, and second, even if that were true, that only gives Trump LESS excuse, not more, for why he didn't send in the troops immediately. If they weren't his boys, then what was his incentive to let them do their thing?!

Michelle Obama (obviously) carries the Obama name, and Barack is still a relatively popular president, especially compared to either Trump or Biden. 

Betting site polymarket gives Michelle a 5% chance to be the Democratic nominee, and a 4% chance to win the presidency, meaning betting markets likewise believe that she likely won't be president only because she doesn't want to run, not because she couldn't win. Even Ben Shapiro has said she should run and is the democrats best chance to win. 

My cmv is as follows- if Michelle Obama decided to run, and Biden endorsed her, she would have very strong (probably around 80%) odds of winning, as per betting markets. You can add on that I believe that no one else has higher odds of winning than she does.

1e11r9e,cmv: islam is the most political and furthest away religion from universal truth,"i think that all religions offer fragments of truth, that when pieced together eclectically and viewed figuratively, with an open mind can answer questions like where do we come from, why we're here etc. i know that all religions can serve political agendas but i feel like islam was specifically designed for that and it seems to be the furthest away from the same universal truth that each other religion tried to convey in its way, according to its historical and societal context.

islam positions itself as a correction to all these previous religions and harbors a historical and doctrinal insistence on its absolute truth and finality, which results in a heightened display of agression, defensiveness and self entitlement among many muslims. 

this manifests in a resistance to criticism and further insistence on the primacy of islam even when its principles clash with modern values or other people's beliefs (i noted that many muslims are not respectful towards other people's beliefs, and if they are it tends to be a feigned respect) 

in contrast, i feel like other religions tend to follow the same developmental trajectory and have a certain complementarity to them that allows for flexible interpretation. but islam's distinct approach resists such integration aiming instead to establish its supremacy.

this intrinsic defensiveness leads to intra-community conflicts, and muslims tend to monitor each other's behavior as well (im thinking of the 100 monkeys experiment) which brings me to my next point which is that islam incorporates values that can be seen as mechanisms of control. like the strong emphasis on obedience to parents (which we know can be harmful), the punitive measures for apostasy and blasphemy and the authority of religious leaders and scholars (literally every king of a muslim monarchy claims descendance from the prophet even when it doesn't make sense from an ethnical pov, im from a country like that and i can assure you that it works in maintaining the status quo) and their interpretations are accepted without question, stifling critical thinking and personal interpretation. 

i feel like islam encourages adherence through fear and hate. like i as a child, at school or at home i would get told a lot of scary stories to justify what should and shouldn't be done, and i always lived in anxiety bc i interpreted stuff literally, that was probably due to my autism. but i digress. 

anyways change my view.

1edo50c,CMV: stigma against the childless needs to end,"As a man in my early 20s, my friends and I are regularly bombarded by comments from family like “you need to find someone to have kids with soon”; “you need to have kids when you’re young”; “you will regret not having kids”; “only losers don’t have kids” and so on.

That’s just family right? We learn to live with it. But when Trump’s permanently-grumpy running mate called childless women “cat ladies” , I thought: this type of behaviour needs to stop.

I don’t have anything against having children. If that’s part of your journey in life, then I wish you well. Maybe it brings you immense fulfillment in life, and if so, I’m happy for you.

However, in my personal observation, many more people are less happy than when they were childless. And many more people regret having children than not having children.

So a lot of people, especially my age, are realizing that beyond economic limitations, we just aren’t interested in having children because we’d be less happy if we did. I, for one, would much rather be hiking or biking on my own than changing diapers or watching little league games.

And I don’t see anything wrong with doing what maximizes my happiness if it doesn’t harm anyone else.

So if you’re someone who thinks there’s something so unethical or immoral about this opinion or lifestyle that people should be called “cat ladies” for having them, I’m happy to discuss.",honeyetsweet,543,1043,0.6299999952316284,0.2730249882447111,1722107740,/r/changemyview/comments/1edo50c/cmv_stigma_against_the_childless_needs_to_end/,2024,7

But just because we make up these answers doesn't mean they has any truth behind them; they just serve as a placeholder until we can find the answers.

Black is the more prominent of the members.  A few days ago, during a ""make a wish"" segment at a concert, Gass said his wish was something to the effect of ""that the shooter doesn't miss next time"".

Black went on to cancel the rest of the tour, also stating that future creative plans are now on hold.  Gass issued an apology - not a ""sorry if you were offended"" type, but an outright ""what I said was wrong"" kind.  He knew what he said was inexcusable.  

I do not understand peoples' reaction to this.

*""Oh, so now they're holding satirical comedians to a higher standard that political candidates!""*  Huh?  Who's ""they""?  Black is an outspoken liberal, so he's never been supportive of Trump and similar people.  He's holding his bandmate to the same standards he's held others to, including politicians.  

*""This must be that cancel culture that Republicans 'don't believe in'!""*  Again, huh?  Jack Black himself is the one who pulled the plug.  The promoter didn't cancel the tour.  The venues weren't canceling shows.  The leader of the freaking band made the decision.  

*""What a way to treat your friend.""*  Still confused here.  Ever since 2016, people on my side of the political spectrum (left-leaning) have been quite vocal about the notion that you can, and should, disavow your own freaking family if they say outrageously toxic things.

1e8hzgg,CMV: You CAN be racist to white people,"Why is there such an insane double standard when it comes to white people and non-white people on the subject on racism?

Why is a black or asian or latino, etc. person able to call a white person a racial slur without anyone batting an eye? But when a white person does the same, it's suddenly not ok? Why is that?

A racial slur is a derogatory term used against members of a culture, nationality or ethnicity. The N-word is a derogatory term used against black people. Cracker is a derogatory term used against white people.

Why is it ok to use one, but not the other? Why because of the colour of my skin is it ok for someone to say haneous things to me and make me suffer through it without being able to call it out because ""you can't be racist to white people"" or some other unjust reason?

Racism is discrimination against members of a culture, nationality or ethnicity. If you discriminate against any culture, nationality or ethnicity then you are racist. It doesn't matter what country, ethnicity or community you belong to, it is racist to discriminate based on those factors. You can be racist to anyone.

One argument I have heard many times is that white people can't experience racism because they ""systemically oppress"" other ethnic groups. Ok. Here's a hypothetical:

Let's say that tomorrow we are all transported back to the time where we were cavemen. No society, not system, no government. Nothing.

If a white person calls an Asian person a slur, is that racist? Yes it is because that falls under the definition of discrimination.

If an Asian person calls a white person a slur, is that racist? Yes it is because that also falls under the definition of discrimination. There is no ""systemic oppression"" excuse now. It's the stone age. No society, nothing like that. Just basic human emotions and conflicts.

It is racist to call a white person a slur the same way it is racist to call a black, Asian, Latino, etc. person a slur. And yet white people are forced to endure being called these things and not being able to call out the unfair and unjust treatment we are subject to.

I am so sick and tired of seeing the media pushing this false narrative that it's ok to hate white people. But if a white person said it's ok to hate any other race, they would be harassed to no end.

1e0zbhu,CMV: DNA tests for paternity should be required to put a father on a child’s birth certificate. ,"For starters, I believe the requirement of DNA testing for men to be on a birth certificate is necessary to protect all parties involved; mothers, fathers, children. 

The idea of men getting a DNA test for paternity can be tricky subject for lots of potential fathers. For obvious reasons, many women could take the idea of a man asking for a DNA  paternity test as a slap in the face because it can be viewed as an accusation of infertility. I fully understand why a faithful partner might feel this way and think it’s a fair view. 

Unfortunately, there are other women that use the first scenario as a way to emotionally manipulate men into NOT getting paternity tests when they know that there is a chance the person they want to be the father is not. This can result in horrible outcomes such as emotional devastation, financial loss, and embarrassment for men as well as alienation, resentment, and the destruction of the family for children. All of these situations could be avoided with DNA testing requirements. 

To cover the costs of such testing, there are several options. 

1. Fathers with financial means pay out of pocket or through insurance. 

2. Fathers without financial means could request government assistance.

3. Fathers that try to use this to avoid taking responsibility could be court ordered and charged/fined to cover the costs (only if they are the father). 

Obviously, there are situations where a man is willing to take responsibility for a child that is not their own. For these situations, the option to adopt exists. 

Bottom line, FNA is a small price to pay in the big picture of raising a child. It makes far more sense to spend a few hundred dollars up front for a DNA test as opposed to paying the emotional and financial costs that could arise years down the road.

I’m sure some people think this is a crazy take. Tell me why I’m all wrong.

Most people chanting ""From the river to the sea"" or other phrases like this do not even know the meaning of what they are saying. Not to mention that these statements are usually inflammatory coming out of these people's mouths. People scream these at protests but refuse to acknowledge any other point of view as having a sliver of validity, because a different opinion just equals wrong here. All this does is create more hate between the two sides when both sides can't talk about it without being accused of any number of hateful words. If on average more people were tolerant of people with different views on this subject, and tried to educate, the divide in countries beside Israel/Palestine wouldn't be nearly so bad.

Most people on both sides also don't hope for the possibility of a cease-fire. They want the eradication of a state, one way or another. This has become a war of hate, both in those countries and in others.

Furthermore, the age demographic I am referring to has completely forgotten about the Russo-Ukrainian war.

1dt030v,CMV: There's no way to punish being homeless without perpetuating a cycle of poverty that causes homelessness.,"I've been talking with a lot of friends and community members about the subject of homelessness in my area, and have heard arguments about coming down harder on homeless encampments - especially since [the recent Supreme Court ruling on the subject](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/28/nx-s1-4992010/supreme-court-homeless-punish-sleeping-encampments). And despite the entirely separate humanitarian argument to be made, I've been stuck on the thought of: **does punishing homeless people even DO anything?**

I recognize the standard, evidence-supported Criminal Justice theory that tying fines or jail time to a crime is effective at deterring people from committing that crime - either by the threat of punishment alone, or by prescribing a behavioral adjustment associated with a particular act. However, for vulnerable populations with little or nothing left to lose, I question whether that theory still holds up.

* Impose a fine, and you'll have a hard time collecting. Even if you're successful, you're reducing a homeless person's savings that could be used for getting out of the economic conditions that make criminal acts more likely.

* Tear down their encampment, and they'll simply relocate elsewhere, probably with less than 100% of the resources they initially had, and to an area that's more out of the way, and with access to fewer public resources.

* Jail them, and it not only kicks the can down the road (in a very expensive way), but it makes things more challenging for them to eventually find employment.

1dukx9u,CMV: Universal Income is a great idea.,"I believe that Universal Income would be a great thing for society. 

Everyone gets a set amount of money each month from the government. 

Not a massive amount. Just enough for people to be able to be fed and sheltered. 

I suppose it would be best to work it out differently for people based on their living situation.

So a single person living alone would get more money than a person living with a partner, as it has to cover their rent. 

So just to throw numbers out for an example... maybe £/$500 each a month for the couple and £/$1000 for the single person. So the household income amounts to the same. 

There would of course be a few different scenarios of course, like if they have kids, how many kids they have etc. 

But the basic idea is that we make it so everyone can just about survive on the money they’re given. 

Most people would want more than the bare minimum. So they can go out and get a job and use the extra money they’re making to pay for life’s luxuries. 

This would also encourage people to take risks in starting a company, developing a new product for instance. So it should lead to innovation as people know if it all goes tits up, they won’t lose their house. 

And of course the money given out is going back into society either by spending on products or services, or by creating a company and then paying staff who will spend their money in society. 

It’s really on the very rich people who hoard money. For everyone else, money just goes round in circles, so it’s not a case of just giving money to people and it just being a big cost for the government, because that money keeps circulating.

1dw7szc,CMV: Imprisoning CEOs of companies that hire illegal immigrants would effectively end most illegal immigration. The fact that any policy like this hasn't been proposed is proof that neither American party wants to actually address the issue. ,"Here is how you end illegal immigration in the US. 

You don't build walls. You don't increase border security funding. 

You curb people's desire to come here. 

Why do they come here? Despite being illegal, thousands upon thousands of American businesses hire illegal labor and pay them cash under the table. 


ICE could be converted into a Labor Auditing department (we may already have one but since it's obviously not effective, I'll refer to making a new one) that is funded effectively and whose goal is to audit all business employees to make sure they are legal. Not only will NEW-ICE conduct audits, they can conduct undercover operations on large organizations to find out if they are hiring illegals. 

If a business is found to be employing illegal labor, the hiring managers and CEOs could face 2-3 years in prison. This will encourage business leadership to heavily audit themselves and ensure that when NEW-ICE comes investigating, their books are clean. 

It wouldn't address the illegals that already live here. But when these people can't find work anymore, word will spread and they will stop wasting their time crossing into a country where businesses are too scared of imprisonment to hire them.

Thats my proposal. 

Here's the thing, I don't want you to CMV on why that proposal is a bad idea. 

I know it's a bad idea. It's a great solution for solving the issue Trump brought up after every question during the debate. (migrants flooding in). 

People truly don't understand how ingrained illegal labor is in our society. Do you know how much of the food you get from grocery stores has been handled and processed by illegal labor? It's one of the reasons prices are so low. 

People would freak out if produce prices doubled over even tripled because companies have to pay higher wages to American or legal work visa owners to harvest their produce. 

Both parties know that actually fixing illegal immigration would be a disaster for their reelection chances. As we've seen, rising food prices, gas prices, and inflation are most people's top priority politically. 

Is it right that companies exploit cheap labor? No. But since when has the American voter cared about morals? In our individualistic society, we care far more about our bottom lines than ethics and working conditions for non Americans. 

Nobody wants to fix illegal immigrants coming in because we need them to sustain our 1st world lifestyles. 

And yet, we fight over it and catasrophize it because most people are dumb, uneducated, and do not understand the complexities around it. 

Which is why you shouldn't vote for either party based on their border policies. Look at other policies they propose because they are straight up lying to you about the nature of immigration in this country.

* implementation of selectively more aggressive tariffs on Chinese goods (to \~60% in some cases?)
* targeted reduction in trade with China specifically
* a [broader desire](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-vance-us-dollar.html) to weaken the U.S. dollar to support U.S. exports
* a [mass program](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/trump-immigration-republicans-explained.html) of deportation
* at least maintaining individual tax cuts

Whether or not any of these things are important or necessary per se, all of them are inflationary:

* A universal tariff is effectively a 10% tax on imported goods. Whether or not those tariffs will be a boon do domestic industry isn't clear.
* Targeted Chinese tariffs are equally a tax, and eliminating trade with them means getting our stuff from somewhere else - almost certainly at a higher rate.
* His desire for a weaker dollar is just an attitudinal embracing of higher-than-normal inflation. As the article says, it isn't clear what his plans are - all we know is he wants a weak dollar. His posturing at independent agencies like the Fed might be a clue, but that's purely speculative.
* Mass deportation means loss of low-cost labor.
* Personal tax cuts are modestly inflationary.

All of the *together* seems to me to be a prescription for pretty significant inflation. Again - whether or not any of these policy actions are independently important or expedient for reasons that aren't (or are) economic, that is an effect they will have.",blancpainsimp69,747,426,0.7599999904632568,0.17739647706067502,1721252433,/r/changemyview/comments/1e5u7gm/cmv_trumps_intended_economic_policies_will_be/,2024,7
1e0c7po,CMV: Antinatalism is an evil concept,"Antinatalism - the belief that it is morally wrong or unjustifiable for people to have children.

There is a large following on the r/antinatalism page that I have been watching for a few weeks now.  Many on the page tend to post about how they wish they have never been born, how humanity is a scourge to the earth, how people that have kids are extremely selfish for letting their kids into a world where they might feel pain.  I am very confused as to the entire movement.

Some antinatalists want all life dead, but I believe that to be a small percentage, most just want all humans dead so that the animals and the earth can live better without the polution from humans.

Do not animals experience pain just like humans?  More so even?  That seems like it would negate the majority of the antinatalists arguments.  That animals will continue killing each other in horrific ways even if humanity was gone.

It seems to me the best course for all life, grant it some antinatalists do not want any life, which is evil, the best course for all life is for the humans to survivie, continue to innovate and continue to learn how to bring life into a better way.

Humans are the most intelligent species, the most likely to harvest technologies to stop climate change, if you believe it exists, to stop suffering in all manner of ways.

1dx1ltc,CMV: Most Americans’ daily lives would be worse without democracy,"I ask this question sincerely because I have significant anxiety about the current election, its outcome, and the consequences of losing democracy. I think the odds of my view changing are low, but I’d sleep better if I genuinely thought a different form of government could possibly work well for most people.   

My baseline belief is that democracy, as a broad-based feedback mechanism, helps drive social and economic prosperity over time because it holds the powerful decision makers accountable to the needs of the many. And that if this mechanism goes away, things get worse in large important ways (eg food / water safety, health care, and civil order) and in smaller ways (eg traffic, travel, and options for entertainment).

1eg8y7e,CMV: A woman that exploits a mans loneliness for money is just as bad as a man that exploits a girl that's struggling financially. ,"I just watched a YouTube video about a grown man that killed his entire family and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Webcam Models. The ""pay to play"" women that will talk to you and give you a show for money. Obviously she did not force this man to do what he did, but this guy clearly had issues, and she failed to use adequate judgement. She is an average looking women, nothing special about her, and yet some random guy from across the world is spending thousands and obsessed with her? She had to know he was not right in the head, nobody is that oblivious. But this case alone is not the reason for my opinion. This is happening all over the place online, you go to dating apps, men looking for companionship, you have escorts on there, scammers, women trying to exploit men in any way they can to come up financially, and it's often the lonely or unattractive men that are targeted. 

  
I believe this is just as bad if not worst than a wealthy man exploiting a woman who needs help financially. Women give you a set amount of time, and then you're out. At least in the case of a man exploiting a woman she gets a place to stay, resources, etc.. Not saying it's a vacation, but she is getting something to help her in life.

1dz40b2,CMV: Unqualified hatred of landlords is either hypocritical or impractical,"First of all, I'm not a landlord. I don't own any rental properties and haven't ever purchased real estate as an investment, but I've never seen anything intrinsically *wrong* with doing that.

However, over the last couple of years I've seen an increasing amount of redditors arguing that there *is* something intrinsically wrong with being a landlord ... that the basic idea of ""real estate as an investment"" is wrong, and that people who do it are fundamentally immoral. ""I wouldn't date a landlord"", ""landlords shouldn't exist"", that sort of thing. To me, that position is either hypocritical, fundamentally impractical, or nonsensical.

Now, to be clear: I'm not saying that all landlords are moral, or that there are no circumstance where ""property as an investment"" *is* immoral. I'm not arguing with people who have a problem with slumlords or predatory real estate companies or individual landlords that do everything they can to screw tenants out of money while never meeting their own obligations ... I've dealt with these people, and they suck. 

I'm focused on people that think the very idea of a landlord is wrong, which seems to boil down to one of three positions:

* **""Housing is a basic necessity of life, you shouldn't be able to profit off of it!""** OK... but the builder who builds the house wants money, the bank that pays the builder makes money off the loan... zooming out, you'll die a lot quicker without food than housing, yet people aren't claiming that farmers are evil or grocery stores are evil or chefs are evil. You'll die even faster without water, but folks aren't saying the utility company is evil for charging you for it. Why is charging people to live in a house they didn't build on land they didn't buy wrong? *This is a hypocritical position.*
* **""There's not enough housing -- landlords compete with homeowners to buy up houses and that drives up the cost of housing!""** If you think about this for a couple of minutes, you can see that landlords can't be the root cause of the problem here. There is a finite amount of people who need housing in any given market; prices go up because demand for housing outstrips supply of housing. Landlords buying up housing does nothing to decrease the supply of housing ... in fact, if it outpaces the growth of renters, it means rental rates go down, which reduces the value of rental properties. The issue here is that housing supply isn't increasing to meet demand. *This is a nonsensical position.*
* **""All property is theft. The only value comes through labor.""** From this perspective, ownership can only come through direct labor; your farm is yours because *you* work it, the food it produces is yours because it was created with *your* labor, and so on. Any form of capitalism is wrong; inheriting a house from your parents is wrong, having a 401k is wrong, opening a local bakery and paying employees is wrong ... etc. This is internally consistent, but requires a fundamentally different society than the one we live in -- and one that seems to produce much worse results. Yes, yes, ""real communism has never been tried"" and so on, but a capitalist-socialist hybrid seems to produce the best outcomes for the average person of any human society, so pragmatically I'm not trying to blow it up to be the next society to prove that real communism has never been tried.

Fair warning: I'm not super eager to debate with people who want to debate point #3 based on the belief that communism is the best economic model. If you're doing your best to actually live by these economic values I give you credit, but you will have to be *wildly* convincing if you want me to adopt a purely communist worldview.",badass_panda,0,820,0.49000000953674316,0.16110019646365423,1720535847,/r/changemyview/comments/1dz40b2/cmv_unqualified_hatred_of_landlords_is_either/,2024,7
1eaa9ks,CMV: It should be just as acceptable to tell an obese person to lose weight as it is to tell a smoker to quit,"This hit me a few days ago when my family asked me to participate in an “intervention” for my uncle who smokes probably 2 packs a day. I agreed to be a part of it.

During her speech, my cousin (who is probably 5’4 350lbs) said something like “I want you to be alive to see your grandchildren get born”.

As powerful of a statement as that was, I started thinking that if we had a similar intervention for her she would go apeshit. And people would consider it “fat shaming” and “fat phobic”, even though the intention would be the same: to stop her from slowly killing herself.

If you still aren’t convinced of the double standard consider a man who smokes married to a morbidly obese woman. What do you think would be seen as more socially acceptable: the woman telling him to stop smoking for the sake of his health, or the man telling her to stop eating so much for the sake of her health?

This isn’t to say that anyone should go around commenting on strangers’ weight. Just like it isn’t appropriate to comment on strangers’ smoking habit. But both are addictions and they should both be able to be brought up by loved ones without one being stigmatized more than the other.

Admittedly this is from an American point of view where obesity is very common and smoking is not. Maybe it’s not like that in other parts of the world but there is a definite double standard in America and that double standard isn’t justified.

1e8dlgg,CMV: The discourse on sexual assault has gone too far.,"(Incredibly controversial, I know.) 

Firstly, let me just say I’m obviously not talking about *serious* cases of sexual assault - things like actual rape, pedophilia, sex trafficking etc are all heinous crimes and obviously deserve to be condemned as such. I’m instead talking about less severe and more murky forms of SA - things like being kissed at a party by someone you didn’t know, being felt up by a partner you’re sleeping in bed with after you said you didn’t feel like having sex, etc.

I feel like theres this new idea that what used to be called “awkward moments” are now considered just as bad as full-on rape. Having someone slap you on the ass at an alcohol-fuelled party might feel gross and wrong, but is it really *that* life-altering and damaging? Not to mention so much of this discourse seems to treat human hormones as this on/off switch that can’t be influenced in any way by drugs, atmosphere, misinterpreted cues, etc.

And I say this freely as someone who has been both a victim of and committed acts of these “awkward moments.” I’ve had weird sexual experiences that I didn’t consent to, been kissed by random people, slapped on the butt, and so on, but I’ve also touched people inappropriately, made misguided attempts to hook up with someone, etc. 

The problem I see is that we are, at our core, sexual beings, and sexuality is an incredibly powerful and difficult thing to get a grapple on, so obviously mistakes are going to be made (especially so if you’re young and inexperienced.) In fact, I’d argue that unless you’re a nun or something it’s pretty much impossible to go through life without *some* awkward encounters, for both men and women. 

And again, I’m not talking about the more obviously terrible acts - forcing someone to have sex with you against their will, using a position of power/status to coerce others to sleep with you, etc. These are deeply wrong and should be punished. I’m just talking about the moments that might cross boundaries but usually have a far more innocent explanation than “he/she is a predator looking to exploit others no matter what.”

The only other alternative I see is that society eschews human sex entirely and we all become a bunch of shut-ins relying on future sexbots for pleasure, and nothing else. I mean honestly, with the amount of sexlessness being experienced by Gen Z and the incredibly arcane levels of consent education being promoted these days, it honestly feels like we’re already moving that way, but whatever. 

Anyway, that’s just my view. I’m fully prepared to be eaten alive in the comments. ",tired_lover,227,671,0.6100000143051147,0.160301773298884,1721534224,/r/changemyview/comments/1e8dlgg/cmv_the_discourse_on_sexual_assault_has_gone_too/,2024,7
1e5v5gg,"CMV: Even if a fetus were considered a fully-fledged human, abortion should still be permitted for the mother without limitations according to United States law. ","To start: I am not looking for moral appeals here. “It kills the baby” “it’s wrong” “it’s mean” “you shouldn’t have gotten pregnant” are not arguments against my position. I am arguing within the legal theory of the United States, not within a moral framework for this argument. 

Assumptions: I grant for the sake of argument that an unborn fetus is a human being with all rights that should be accorded to natural born citizen. 

As an aside, in an extreme view of this position I would hold that once viability has been reached, the fetus should be eligible as a tax dependent, a co-rider for carpool lanes, and should have a social security number, etc. Please note that personally I do not feel that this is true, but for the sake of a stronger argument, I am allowing the pro-life side a stronger starting position: ie; granting the fetus full-personhood. 

Argument: The fetus is a human being who cannot survive without a birth. This human will die if they do not leave the womb through a medical procedure: ie, birth. 

This surgery is unique in that it requires a medical intervention on the body of the patient benefitting from the surgery (the fetus being born) but it also requires to consent and cooperation of a third party to be involved in and accept the dangers of the surgery: the mother who is giving birth. The fetus cannot be born, and thus cannot live, without being born by the mother, full-stop. The mother, on the other hand, can continue to live quite easily without going through the dangerous medical intervention that is childbirth. Her life is not endangered by the requirement to give birth, only that she is forced into a binary of doing something about the pregnancy, but abortion is significantly safer than a birth or Caesarean section, and in a purely pragmatic sense is the better option for her own health and wellbeing (assuming she does not want a child)

When taking this into account, the closest analogue I can think of would be a sickly sibling in need of a kidney. You are their only match. Without the kidney, your sibling will die, without question. And also without question, donating your kidney is dangerous, and poses a risk to yourself personally. 
But, while it may be morally wrong, or distasteful to not want to put yourself through the danger of that surgery to save your sibling, it is NOT MURDER TO NOT DONATE YOUR KIDNEY, EVEN IF THEY WILL DEFINITELY DIE WITHOUT IT. You choosing not to undergo a dangerous medical procedure that is unnecessary to your own personal medical wellbeing is not murder, even if that has the direct consequence of the death of another. It would insanity to force you to donate your kidney to a match, in the same way it should be insane to force a woman to give birth to a human. 

In fact, even if you had recently died, if you aren’t an organ donor, your rights to bodily autonomy, even as a corpse, trump your siblings need to violate your bodily autonomy in order to keep living. 

Even if all that was needed to save the person’s life was a single drop of your blood, you cannot be compelled to give it if I don’t want to. 

So why, when the rights of living, breathing, tax-paying, spouse-having, kidney-needing adult humans cannot supersede your abilities to make your own personal decisions regarding which medical procedures to engage in, should a fetus, even with the full rights of men, be able to do so?",cudakid210,369,566,0.6899999976158142,0.1574854328065715,1721254769,/r/changemyview/comments/1e5v5gg/cmv_even_if_a_fetus_were_considered_a/,2024,7
1dub06l,CMV: America is still worth fighting for. Don't give up the ship.,"Hello there. 

In the past week I have seen an alarming amount of very defeatist content online. I have also heard a concerning amount of defeatism from my friends.

I have seen a lot of people talking about moving out of the country in December, talking about leaving immediately, and some even talking about suicide.

I know it seems really bad right now but this isn't the time to give up. This isn't the time to say boo hoo we lost a court case, this is the end and we should all get the fuck out.

It's not time to abandon ship yet, everyone should take a deep breath and think. While the prospect of Project 2025 and the idea of another Trump presidency are scary, they aren't unstoppable.

There are hundreds of thousands of men and women who have sworn to protect the Constitution of the United States of America, and we must have faith. Trusted agencies and government organizations must have the faith of the population if they are going to make a stand against whatever is ahead.

All is not lost. We are not defenseless. Don't give up the ship.

1e2558t,CMV: Wealthy students screaming ‘global intifada’ is causing the rise in Islamophobia.,"Happy to have my view changed here.

It seems to me that whenever there is an issue in the world it is comparatively wealthy students who, rather than help the situation, turn it into some kind of fashion trend and push it to a ridiculous extreme. This in turn stokes an equal and opposite reaction in the wider public.

With my limited knowledge of global politics, I would personally support a ceasefire in Gaza. I believe this view has pretty broad support (at least in the U.K.) The scenes coming through from the conflict are just too horrific to continue. 

This view is made controversial by calls for a ‘global intifada’ or ‘from the river to the sea’ of such other euphemisms for the destruction of the state of Israel (which I definitely do not support).

I suspect some might argue “when people say global intifada it just means ‘rising up against oppression’”.

I believe students know this phrase is incendiary and intimidating, with global connotations of violence. They deliberately stoke tensions by not simply calling for a ceasefire, but scaring people with divisive rhetoric. The aim being more about showing off to their friends, than affecting peaceful change.

This is then seen and broadcast by news organisations that are already unfriendly to minorities. Viewers see this rhetoric and conflate it with the views of ordinary Muslims in the west. 

The net result is it feeds into pre existing fears about Islamic extremism, and pushes people further into full blown inslamaphobia. Which we can see evidenced in the elections across Europe (Reform U.K., French National Rally, AfD in Germany all making huge gains). 

As usual, poor minorities get hurt, whilst wealthy students get likes and shares.

1egy8na,CMV: Packing the US Supreme court is a bad strategy in the long run.,"With its rulings over the last couple years, many people (Myself included) no longer believe the Supreme court is impartial or apolitical as it was intended to be, and that it's been internally compromised by corruption and partisanship. Supreme court reform is Obviously needed, and one common suggestion on how to do that is to pack the court. The concept is quite simple, with a larger court, a small biased minority will have a harder time influencing rulings, among other benefits.

There are issues with this however, the first being why and how the packing would begin. The most common suggestion for expanding the court is for Biden or Harris once she steps up (Assuming she wins) expanding the court to 13 justices, one for each circuit. The implication of course being that all five of the new judges would be young and liberal. This will cause issues down the line however, since republicans will be watching closely. The republicans will likely win at least one of the next 3-4 presidential elections, and when they do they'll be nothing to stop them from packing the court again, say to 17. Then Dems win again, and bump it up to 21. You see where this leads, the court will start ballooning, and justices will be blatantly political. With so many positions opening up, prospective justices may start all but campaigning  for them, hoping to be selected by party leadership on either side. If the packing doesn't stop then within decades the court will be a bloated, partisan, ineffective office where any pretense of them still ""interpereting the constitution"" will be long gone, as the SC becomes a third legislative chamber.",Working-Salary4855,400,474,0.7300000190734863,0.1432993867534406,1722459515,/r/changemyview/comments/1egy8na/cmv_packing_the_us_supreme_court_is_a_bad/,2024,7
