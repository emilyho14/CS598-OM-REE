1bagbcg,CMV: Israel's settlement expansion in the West Bank shows that they have no intention to pursue a peaceful solution to the Israel/Palestine conflict,"A few days ago, Israel has approved [plans](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68490034) for 3,400 new homes in West Bank settlements. This is obviously provocative, especially given the conflict in Gaza and the upcoming Ramadan. These settlements are illegal and widely condemned by Israel's allies and critics alike. It's well known that these settlements are a major roadblock to a cohesive Palestinian state and a significant detrimant to any kind of peaceful solution in the region. This recent move is further proof that Israel is only willing to pursue a violent solution to the problem, by further aggravating the Palestinian population and using its military might to force Palestinians out of the West Bank. 

Can someone show how this latest act is consistent with the belief that Israel has the intention to pursue a peaceful solution to the conflict?",WheatBerryPie,1597,1691,1.0,0.6973698789519611,1709986127,/r/changemyview/comments/1bagbcg/cmv_israels_settlement_expansion_in_the_west_bank/,2024,3
1b88t8t,CMV: a major reason men don't talk about their feelings / problems is that nobody wants to hear it,"I feel like there's a bit of a double standard regarding men talking about our feelings and struggles.

On one hand, it seems like society at large is just *begging* us to open up more. Indeed, we're blamed for not doing so.

But it seems like most of the time when we do, people (women) get *really* uncomfortable. Either it's seen as scary, or you're being a baby, or you need to take that shit to therapy (which is a euphemism for ""stop bothering *me* about this""), or you're unfairly placing a burden of emotional labor on the women in your life.

Bottom line, the message I'm getting is: nobody wants to hear it. If you want a sympathetic ear, you can pay someone to listen, but don't burden anyone else with your scary male feelings.

1b8zblp,CMV: Trump's comments about his daughter are extremely disturbing and show he is clearly attracted to her. This is by itself a major reason to not support this man.,"I have many reasons to not support Donald Trump, but this is one of them that I literally cannot find any explanation to.  
Donald Trump has made sexual comments about her daughter over the years. In one of them he says: ""...a beauty, if I weren't happily married, and, you know, his father..."", he considers ""being happily married"" the primary reason for him to not be with his daughter. On another talk show, they ask him what is his common interests with his daughter and, again, he says ""well I was going to say SEX, but I can't relate this with her..."". There are multiple instances like this, over a very long time period.

I find it literally impossible to support such a cringeworthy and sick individual, how can you? Change my view.

1biwpvb,"CMV: Progressives often sound like conservatives when it comes to ""incels""—characterizing the whole group by its extremists, insisting on a ""bootstrap mentality"" of self-improvement, framing issues in terms of ""entitlement,"" and generally refusing to consider larger systemic forces.","Married guy here. Happy relationship, sexually satisfied, father to a compassionate son, and I find fulfillment in my career.

I don't have a personal stake in the ""Incel Debates,"" but I do know a few loved ones who fit the term and I do spend way too much on the internet readings posts and articles discussing the topic.

Now, nothing in this post is intended to deny the reality that some incels are absolutely shitty people. I would say that I know four younger men who fall into this category and one of them (my youngest brother, actually) is someone I am deeply concerned for as he is now genuinely consumed with bitterness towards the world and women. However, the other three are genuinely great guys. They aren't 9s or 10s pulling down $200k while flexing their six-packs, but they're solid. **I'll put it this way:** I met my wife, dated, and got married in the late 2000s—before the rise of dating apps and the death of Third Spaces. ***If any of these three guys had been single during those years, they would have easily been able to strike up relationships.*** 

And yet I've seen these guys 1) get unfairly tagged with the ""incel"" label and its stigma and 2) listened to their sincere emotional pain over having very few outlets for discussing the loneliness and relational hardships they face. That's really what has prompted this post.

So as someone who grew up in a deeply conservative Southern community and left it for more progressive communities, why am I seeing so many ""conservative"" arguments made in attacking single men who feel like the deck is stacked against them?

**Someone CMV because what I'm seeing is:**

* ""Incels are dangerous misogynists and even terrorists."" This sounds like my conservative hometown talking about Muslims after 9/11. When is judging a whole group by its worst elements ever justified?
* ""Incels should focus on improving themselves instead of complaining all the time—then they'd get dates."" This sounds like my conservative town talking about poor people. Is ""picking yourself up by the bootstraps"" ever the solution to something that is affecting millions of people?
* ""Incels feel like they are *entitled* to sex. No one is entitled to *my* body!"" This sounds like my conservative hometown decades ago when it fought against the end of segregation or today when they cheer for the dismantling of affirmative action. ""No one is *entitled* to a position in my company, so I don't have to hire gay people"" or ""No is *entitled* to admission to Harvard, so they should be free to only admit Whites and Asians.""
* ""Incels just have a victim mentality. No one is oppressing them."" This sounds like my conservative hometown refusing to acknowledge that it things like marginalization and systemic injustice don't rely on mustache-twirling cartoon villains—they come about and perpetuate themselves through our inaction and refusal to consider how even our seemingly benign actions could be causing harm to someone else.",Sbis31,758,1847,1.0,0.529627189940259,1710885682,/r/changemyview/comments/1biwpvb/cmv_progressives_often_sound_like_conservatives/,2024,3
1bbox25,CMV: HAMAS is at fault for the tragedy in Gaza,"I'm not super educated in geopolitics and history. I think it should be easy to CMV. I just need to understand better because from the research I did it seemed pretty clear cut and obvious.

Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. They provided some social services and now the care of the people who live there is under Hamas. Their safety and well-being is now in HAMAS's hands.

How did they take care of their people? Well by shooting missiles at a superior military for two decades. Then when they finally hit Israel a little too hard, and Israel dropped warnings to evacuate, HAMAS told their people it's a bluff and to ignore it... This seems super obvious that HAMAS has been doing this the whole time so that a big enough tragedy happens that they get attention and resources because of the tragedy. Public opinion shift was the goal. 

I understand that whole area has a very complicated history. I mean since ancient Mesopotamia crazy events have been taking place in that part of the world. I'm sure if you ask either party who started it, their answers will go back indefinitely since the dawn of civilization.

Is it not rational to assign responsibility during the leadership shift in 2007? I mean if aliens invaded with superior technology, and warned us not to attack, and one of our leaders commanded us to attack... And we get wiped out... That's poor leadership no? As much as we cry that the land should have been ours, the new military might situation requires strategy adjustment to protect lives.

If the state cannot prevent the sexual assault, than the very least they could do is pick up the tab and not force him to pay child support.

1b7dge6,"CMV: A racist action does not need to be a product of systemic racism to still be racism. ie: racism against white people is racism, just not systemic.","Some context: I am a white man, my girlfriend is an indigenous women earning her master's in indigenous governance. This is a heated discussion we have had a couple times. This post will not be used as a defense of my stance, just an alternative view point for me to learn her view point.

I believe that racism, on its own is described as any judgement of a person solely based on their skin color, ancestry, race, etc. This does exclude white people.

I understand that racism for many people is systemic. I am aware of redlining, residential schools, generational trauma, racist school funding practices, and so forth.

I try to convey that the viewpoints I hear on systemic racism being a product exclusively by white people are extremely north american centric and that these arguements fly out the window the moment you land in Japan or Iran or many other countries. To be clear, that does not invalidate that white people are exclusively at fault for north american systemic racism.

I believe that racism and systemic racism are not synonymous but rather that systemic racism is a further defined type of racism. It just happens to be much more prevailent than plain racism. 

I also want to be clear that though there are people arguing that white people are victims of racism en masse, that is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about solo white kids at a black school getting bullied. I'm talking about a white guy working for an indigenous company having his co workers belittle his work. These situations are rare, but they shouldn't be waved off as not actions of racism simply because they are not systemic.",gooddrawerer,982,837,1.0,0.3902448258116483,1709665410,/r/changemyview/comments/1b7dge6/cmv_a_racist_action_does_not_need_to_be_a_product/,2024,3
1bk7l5z,CMV: Apple stuff is overpriced and students have no real need for them,"I admit iPhones aren't a bad idea nowadays, but most everything else that Apple makes is overpriced to oblivion.

People keep recommending Macbooks to students, but honestly I feel like students are the last people who should buy a Mac. The cost of the 13 inch Macbook Air is already inflated at 1100 USD for a machine with 8 GB  RAM and a measle 256 GB of storage, and the second you start upgrading the specs Apple dials the bullshit up to 11. increasing system RAM by 8GB is 200 dollars and going from 256GB SSD to 1TB is a whopping 400 dollars. Outside of battery life, this thing would get destroyed by a thin and light Windows machine of around the same price like the Legion Slim 5 or Asus G14. Plus both of these 2 examples have far better displays and a discrete GPU.

The Apple watch is meh at best considering the poor battery life and ugly tiny spiderweb app drawer thing that's pure eye torture. But I guess the regular Apple watch 9 is a bit understandable. The Ultra is a huge dumpster fire though, it's advertised as an outdoors watch but it still has sad battery life at 36 hours which is a joke compared to established outdoors nav watches like the Fenix 7 pro series with up to 37 days of battery life. Worse yet it's supposed to be used by divers but it requires touch interactions for most things... For a watch that you're supposed to use underwater...

Apple's products aren't competitive at their respective prices at all, which makes it  extra strange that people recommend them to students.",Core2score,986,719,1.0,0.3687440091289464,1711030669,/r/changemyview/comments/1bk7l5z/cmv_apple_stuff_is_overpriced_and_students_have/,2024,3
1bp18yd,CMV: Any religion that has inherent homophobia and/or misogyny is underserving of any kind of respect and should be shunned,"Any religious excuse for discrimination or oppression of people based on immutable characteristics is beyond disgusting and makes one a bad person. This starts with the claim that being homosexual is fin, but acts of homosexuality are a sin. This is homophobia presented to be less offensive. The view still wants homosexual people to whole up and hide themselves from society. It wants them to be romantically unhappy for their entire life. Anybody that holds this view is trash in my view.

For misogyny, a good example is authority. People will say women aren't lesser, they are just different and get different roles. And then completely ignore that those roles blatantly favour the man, give him all the power and authority and then pretend this isn't sexist. 

I am gonna be honest, my respect for religion has greatly dwindled. It's at an all time low and I don't think indoctrination of kids should be legal.

1bissk6,"CMV: most people who dislike centrists/moderates don’t want them to pick A side, they want them to pick THEIR side.","I want to start this off by saying that I would not call myself a moderate, I probably fall more in the classical liberalism camp. I believe that a lot of times whenever people criticize centrists/moderates they don’t even know what they are talking about, thinking that centrists want a compromise on every issue ever. This is not what a centrist is. 

While a centrist may indeed be more likely to admit that they don’t have enough information on a topic to form an opinion (that’s an incredibly wise thing to do, by the way, much better than just picking a side and not knowing what you’re talking about), that’s not what centrism is.

Centrism is having political positions on different topics which could be either considered liberal or conservative, putting their median position in the middle. For example, if you ask a centrist about abortion, gun control, higher taxes, and about universal healthcare, they might be pro-life, anti-gun control, pro-universal healthcare, and think we ought to raise taxes, that would make them, on average, in the middle. Centrists aren’t centrist on issues, they’re centrists on average.

I think most people understand this but pretend not to. It is perfectly fine to dislike centrism on that merit, but it seems that most people tend to distort what centrism is, turning it into a strawman. As seen in a popular comic which I am sure you have seen, a centrist is inbetween the KKK and members of the civil rights movement holding a sign that says “compromise?”

People on the left have used this comic to say “the kkk is the right wing and the civil rights movement is the left wing, and so they’re letting it happen!” Which is multiple straw men in one argument. The fact that this is such a repeated argument shows that they don’t hate moderates because they are moderates, they hate them because they’re not leftists. Same thing goes for the right wing.

There could be two people who have opposite viewpoints on everything, and still both be moderate. It’s not an ideology, it’s a category.",OkieFemboy,748,842,1.0,0.3361369341955116,1710876288,/r/changemyview/comments/1bissk6/cmv_most_people_who_dislike_centristsmoderates/,2024,3
1bgrusp,"CMV: As a left-winger, we were wrong to oppose nuclear power","This post is inspired by this news article: [CSIRO chief warns against ‘disparaging science’ after Peter Dutton criticises nuclear energy costings](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/15/csiro-peter-dutton-gencost-report-nuclear-energy-renewables-cost)

When I was in year 6, for our civics class, we had to write essays where we picked a political issue and elaborate on our stance on it. I picked an anti-nuclear stance.

But that was 17 years ago, and a lot of things have changed since then, for the worse:

* [Australia became the first country to vote in a government to remove a carbon tax](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/17/australia-kills-off-carbon-tax) \- illustrating that progress on climate action can be reversed
* [Germany is expanding coal mining](https://euobserver.com/green-economy/157364) because of a shortage of Russian gas - illustrating that many countries are not yet ready to completely switch to renewables
* The recent wave of climate protests in Australia [only backfired because it led to us losing our right to protest](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/05/30/australias-crackdown-climate-activists)

There are many arguments to be made against nuclear power. A poorly-run nuclear power plant can be a major safety hazard to a wide area. Nuclear can also be blamed for being a distraction against the adoption of renewable energy. Nuclear can also be criticised for further enriching and boosting the power of mining bosses. Depending on nuclear for too long would result in us exhausting our Uranium reserves. 

But unfortunately, to expect a faster switch to renewables is just wishful thinking. This is the real world, a nasty place of political manoeuvring, compromises and climate change denial. Ideally, we'd switch to renewables faster (especially here in Australia where we have a vast surplus of renewable energy potential), but there are a lot of people (such as right-wing party leader Peter Dutton) standing against that. However, they're willing to make a compromise made where nuclear will be our ticket to lowering carbon emissions. What point is there in blocking a ""good option"" (nuclear) in favour for a ""best option"" (renewables) that we've consistently failed to implement on a meaningful scale? 

Even if you still oppose nuclear power after all this, nuclear at worst is a desperate measure, and [we are living in desperate times](https://theconversation.com/climate-tipping-points-are-nearer-than-you-think-our-new-report-warns-of-catastrophic-risk-219243).

Some would argue that it should be kept out of schools, but I don't see any problem with it as long as it is kept age appropriate. It might help combat bullying against gay students by teaching acceptance. My brother is a teacher, and I asked him for his opinion on this. He said that a big part of his job is supporting students, and part of that is supporting his students' identities. (Like, he would be there for them if they came out as gay.)

1bdtc23,Cmv: I don't believe a friend cheating on their partner means I should cut the friend off,"I saw a post this morning on AITA regarding someone asking their partner not to allow their groomsman to bring their affair partner to the wedding. I totally agree with that because the woman who was cheated on was in the wedding party as well.
The part I don't agree with is the many comments stating that the soon to be husband should reconsider his friendship with his friend because he cheated.
In my opinion being a bad partner does not automatically equate to being a bad friend, father, sibling etc. Cheating is horrible and I am not trying to excuse it but I couldn't rationalize cutting off a friend for it, unless they roped me into it or had me cover for them unknowingly.
Edit: So far in this thread cheating has been compared to murder, kicking a dog, domestic/child abuse, and rape. Basically if your not ostracizing a cheater you might as sell support all of that as well. Also your partner will probably end up cheating on you.

1bk2irj,CMV: Netanyahu Never wanted Peace,"\>!DISCLAIMER: This post is only a conversation with the decent people left within our society who just want peace.!<

  
So the Prime minster of israel, and the rest of his extremist cabinet, just want the war to rage on, as long as they get their paychecks, and as long as the people they dislike are dying. Doesn't matter if it's at the cost of kids, elderly, pregnant women, hostages.. They just pretend to have a mission.  
So let's talk about the supposed mission of ""Eliminating Hamas""  
The israeli gov will claim they are only targeting Hamas..  
But, for years, Netanyahu was reported to be helping fund Hamas (as per [TimesOfIsrael](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) & [NyTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-money-prop-up-hamas.html)), and in 2019, He himself said and i [quote](https://twitter.com/haaretzcom/status/1711329340804186619?lang=en); ""Whoever wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support the strengthening and financing of Hamas.""  
On top of that, The current finance minister of israel, said in 2015 and i [quote](https://twitter.com/rulajebreal/status/1720923597873549554) ""Hamas at this point, in my opinion, is an asset.""  
So how can you eliminate your asset?  
Here's the government strategy;  
Keep Hamas in power. Offer anything except a sovereign Palestinian state ""for security reasons"", and disrupt any real effort for Peace ([Osslo accords](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine)). Ignore the illegal settlements ([condemned by the UN](https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15424.doc.htm)), and the killing of Palestinians in the israeli controlled West bank.  
Make life unbearable for Palestinians, Facilitate unemployment [conditions](https://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/20190606_forced_unemployment), cut the water sources ([documented](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/)), introduce bills to control the [courts](https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-supreme-court-overturns-a-key-component-of-netanyahu-s-polarizing-judicial-overhaul-/7420408.html), destroying the biggest buildings in Gaza to displace civilians, killing and arresting civilians who protest or show any contempt of past actions, Hamas attacks you, literally do whatever you want (Defending yourself).  
5 months after Oct the 7th, Gaza flattened, at least 30k civilians dead (most are women and children as reported by the pentagon), israel killed more hostages than released, Hamas still around.  
The goal was clear, even before Oct the 7th, they never wanted Peace, or a Palestinian state.  
2023 was reported to be the deadliest year in the history of the West bank. It got to the point where Biden himself had put a ban on individuals committing atrocities there, and that's not mentioning the uncontrolled army killings, because they see no consequences, they act as if the Palestinian lives do not matter.  
As cited in South Africa's [case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOW_1exsHE8), the army led by Netanyahu believe everyone in Gaza is complicit, as Netanyahu cited the biblical term ""Amalek"" at the beginning of the offensive on Gaza, he said ""Remember what the Amalek has done to you.""  
The biblical scripture regarding Amalekites reads ""I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'  
The IDF soldiers later filmed themselves shouting ""There are no innocent civilians"". They also have filmed themselves celebrating destruction, burning aid, looting homes, posing in women's underwear, mocking traumatized people, the list goes on..  
Currently, famine is looming on many in Gaza, as reports confirm israel have been blocking aid to the entire north, for three month, till two days ago, when they got pressured into letting 13 trucks in, which is way short of what is needed (500 trucks per day as estimated by UN).

  
Earlier this week, The US Senator Chris Van Hollen admits after crafting the national security memorandum, and after the reports, that israel is not in compliance with international law, they are blocking aid such as maternity kits, water purifiers, from entering the Gaza strip, sending back a lot of the of trucks, not to mention letting civilians block aid entrances..  
He also stated that, “There is no doubt that the claims that Netanyahu made that UNRWA is a tool of Hamas are ""flat-out lies,"","" The person who runs operations on the ground in Gaza is a 20 year U.S. Army veteran”, he added.

  
Earlier, The israeli gov claimed 12 UNRWA (Aid agency) members were affiliated with Hamas, without providing evidence, and the US cut aid to UNRWA, so did the EU, amidst famine. Now amidst investigations, there is no evidence of such affiliation, even UNRWA stated that personal were tortured to admit such links. The EU have restored funding, and the US is still pending..  
It has become evident that the Netanyahu's government, and those with extremist ideology (Zionism), never wanted peace in the middle east (as stated in the Likud party charter) they want all the land from Jordan to the sea, and they will abuse the power given to them without oversight  
As history shows, if we really want to achieve peace, we must deliver justice, prosecute criminals, and figure out democratic solutions, without malicious intent from fascist governments.

&#x200B;

And before you go,   
Here are my 3 main questions/concerns to be answered thoroughly for you to change my mind;

&#x200B;

1-  Why would the israeli army [bulldoze](https://twitter.com/i/status/1748013404663537974) trees in the middle of the roads, render all water treatment plants nonfunctional or [destroyed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/middleeast/gaza-water-plant-photos.html), blocking aid trucks from entering maternity kits & water purifiers?

  
2- According to all humanitarian fronts ([UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147656), [IRC](https://www.rescue.org/press-release/famine-imminent-northern-gaza-children-are-being-starved-israels-blockade-and), [ICP](https://www.care-international.org/news/ipc-report-half-gaza-experiencing-catastrophic-hunger-famine-imminent-northern-governorates) and more), 1 million civilians in Gaza right now are facing stage 5 of famine (the highest), why would the israeli gov still blockade the aid when they can control how it is distributed and got the armed forces to secure that?

&#x200B;

3- Some people are yelling ""release the hostages"" on posts of dying kids (as if these kids got them), do you think it's acceptable for the isreali gov to starve kids/innocent civilians to death if Hamas can sort themselves out and not surrender?",HourDrive1510,673,830,1.0,0.31620763878012215,1711013344,/r/changemyview/comments/1bk2irj/cmv_netanyahu_never_wanted_peace/,2024,3
1bde6ww,CMV: It's not unreasonable to be sad or even depressed over a lack of sex.,"So hear me out, human's at the end of the day are animals with a drive to get that special serotonin boost that comes from sex. When someone is unable to get sex, they are doing something that goes against every evolutionary imperative we have. 

Aside from that being able to create and maintain relationships with other human's is a normal social skill that if you are lacking it makes you abnormal. No matter how you slice, it, it is not normal to be unable to form relationships. If this applies to friendships, it should make sense that it apply to romantic relationships as well. 

Romantic relationships are considered a normal part of social development that starts at youth. There's a reason why if someone is a 40 year old man who's never dated or had sex (exculding celibate or asexual people) they will get weird looks. Relationships, and by an extension sex is something that most humans expect to have at some point in their life, and it's a decently reasonable expectation. When you are say 20 and all your friends have dated and had sex, it can be distressing as you see the people around you progressing in a way you are failing to.

You begin to question what is wrong with you and why women don't like you in that way. I know some people say ""if you can't get laid it's 100% your fault 100% of the time"" but some people are just genuinely unlucky. If you believe it's possible for bad things to happen to good people, it's not consistent that someone unable to date is 100% at personal fault. 

Anyways, like I said earlier, you question why and what's wrong with you. Your self esteem takes a hit because it's literally a judgement of you and your attractiveness. It also get's worse as years go on. I'm a 23 year old virgin, I felt a lot less distressed about my inability to attract a woman at 18 than I do now. It's like interest, but sadness. 

I think it's only logical that this can lead someone through pretty rough paths emotionally. ",Tall_Promotion_7160,879,568,1.0,0.3148493947598058,1710291458,/r/changemyview/comments/1bde6ww/cmv_its_not_unreasonable_to_be_sad_or_even/,2024,3
1b71lz0,CMV: You should be able to have weapons for self defence in the UK,"In the UK, we are not allowed to have weapons (lethal or non-lethal) at all for self defence purposes. So if you keep a baseball bat under your bed to use in the event of a break-in into your property, you're in trouble. Same thing with keeping pepper spray in your car, or whatever.

The only way around it is to suggest that the weapon's main use is something other than self defence. For the bat, it'd be that you bought it to play baseball at the park. Would be wise to keep a mit or a ball next to it to make that more believable to the police. For the pepper spray, not sure you can get out of that one. Regardless, I think this is ridiculous

I see absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be able to preemptively plan for bad situations. If someone breaks in, you don't know what they're armed with, how many accomplices they're with, etc. Using lethal weapons I believe can be argued, but using non-lethal weapons should be a no-brainer.

When seconds count, police are minutes away. You should be able to protect yourself before they get there. Criminals don't wait

1b8gfs0,"CMV: Anyone who says ""Israel should never have been established"" has no good argument for what should have happened INSTEAD of Israel being established","I just want to clarify before I start: I am not in any way arguing that the creation of Israel was completely moral, or that people weren't unwillingly displaced, or that there weren't bad faith actors in the Zionist movement. What I am specifically trying to argue is that I truly don't think there was any better *alternative* to establishing Israel as a state (also, I'm specifically talking about the UN resolution that led to this happening, not necessarily the actions taken between the resolution and Israel actually gaining independence--which did involve a lot of back-and-forth killing, displacement, and taking more land than was initially intended). I am pretty confident that anyone who argues that Israel being created as a state was a mistake or that Israel should be dismantled because it should have ""never been created in the first place"" has not actually considered what should have happened instead, or is possibly unaware of some historical facts that led to the necessity of Israel being established.

I'm going to present several arguments (in bold) that someone may make when arguing why Israel shouldn't have been established. My responses to each of these arguments are not serving to discredit the legitimacy of the arguments, but rather show that there wasn't really anything *better* that could have happened in each of these scenarios, unless we want to completely ignore historical context at the time.  
Let's start by talking about the UN resolution 181 that led to splitting Mandatory Palestine into two states--one Jewish, one Arab. The Jews accepted this plan, the Arabs did not.

   
**""But why did the Arabs have to accept? It's their land! They shouldn't have to partition it!""**

For one, it wasn't just ""their land"". Again, it was ""British Mandate of Palestine"". The land was owned by the British, won from the Ottomans after WW1, and there were several Jews living there at the time as well--some who had lived there for years and whose families had never been kicked out of the land, some whom had escaped pogroms in Eastern Europe starting in the 1800's and had legally purchased land from Ottoman landlords, and a large number of refugees escaping from violence both in Europe and in other Middle Eastern countries (more on this in a few points). Now, does Palestine not being a country mean that the opinions of the Arabs living there shouldn't have mattered? Of course not. They had been living there for thousands of years as well. But it isn't true that it was ONLY their land. 

Now, there can definitely be arguments that the *way* the land was partitioned was unfair, or that there were unfair components of the partition, but what would have been the right thing to do in that case? Offer a counter-proposal or counter-solution. Instead, they immediately went to war with Israel months before the partition plan was put into effect.   
Now, if you accept that both Jews and Arabs were living on the land at the time, your argument might be **""They should have just created a binational/unified state where they could all live in harmony like they did before! Jews and Arabs lived together peacefully before Zionism!""**  
First of all, they definitely did not live peacefully together, and this is severe historical revisionism. Of course there were good relationships between Jews and Muslims, it wasn't all hatred. But for the most part, there was a ton of violence and fighting between the two groups. Second of all--many people don't know this, but a binational state was considered and proposed. There are several reasons why that didn't work. This is just one source, so take it with a grain of salt, but here is more info on this that's compressed into a fairly easy-to-follow post: [https://www.instagram.com/p/C2PO89vtUVi/?hl=en&img\_index=1](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2PO89vtUVi/?hl=en&img_index=1) (there are sources for this information in the caption of the post).   
So, long story short: At the time of partition, there were several Jews and Arabs living there, both of whom had the right to live on that land. A binational state wasn't feasible, so there was no option but to partition. To this you might say:  
**""Okay, so there were several Jews there. But why did Palestine have to be responsible for all of them? It's Palestine's land! It's terrible that Jews were kicked out of all those countries, but why did Palestinians have to deal with it?""**  
I mean, here's the thing: The Jews who escaped to Palestine did so because there was a growing Jewish presence there and one of the only places they thought they would be safe. In fact, the British essentially pushed them into Palestine because the UK refused to take in Jewish refugees to help them escape from the Holocaust....while letting them escape to Palestine, despite the fact that they knew the Arabs wouldn't necessarily be happy with this. But ultimately, the reason they escaped was because of violence in the countries they came from, so they were essentially refugees. Are you anti-refugee? Or anti-immigration? Because I don't think anyone trying to argue that ""The Jews shouldn't have immigrated to Palestine and just expected the Arabs to take them all as refugees!"" would have any problem whatsoever with America or other Western countries taking in refugees. In fact, I think that anyone who did had a problem with Arab refugees escaping to Europe, or Latin Americans immigrating to America, would be seen as very racist and ""anti-progressive"". Is it only ""progressive"" to take refugees in when it's Western countries taking them in? Do refugees have to be ""non-white"" for their status as refugees to be taken seriously? (We could also go on for hours here about how the majority of Jews in Israel now come from the Middle East and *aren't* white, or that Ashkenazi Jews in Europe were literally persecuted for not being white enough, but I think you get my drift here--a lot of people view Jews as being ""whiter"" than the rest of the Middle East, therefore have the tendency to view Israelis as ""white colonizers"")  
Now to this you might say: **""But it wasn't just immigration! a lot of the Jews who came to Palestine weren't just there as refugees, they were there as part of the 'Zionist project'! They were intentionally lured there to displace Arabs and create a Jewish state!""**  
Sure, there were many Jews who immigrated to Palestine under the ""Zionist project"", and I've already acknowledged that there were some Zionist leaders who acted in very bad faith. But, there were hundreds of thousands of Jews immigrating there--there is no way that all of them were escaping to Palestine specifically in order to be ""part of the Zionist project"" and help create a Jewish state. Many of them simply needed a safe space to go, and Palestine was one of the only options. When immigrating to Palestine, I can bet you a good majority of them weren't thinking ""Oh yay! Now that I'm escaping persecution and moving to Palestine, I can't wait to be part of this movement that helps turn Palestine into a Jewish state!"" No, they were mostly just concerned with escaping for their lives, and probably couldn't give a sh\*t in the moment about whether or not a Jewish state would eventually be created. And even if they did go there as part of some ""project""--does that mean that because of their so-called ""intentions"", they should be forced to leave? What were they going to do in the 1940's? Were they going to invent some lie-detecting technology to brain-scan every Jew who arrived, to determine whether or not they were there with the intention of ""displacing Palestinians""? Would this any better than America refusing Mexican immigrants because they're worried that the immigrants are trying to ""take all their jobs"", or refusing Muslim refugees because they're worried that they're going to try to ""impose Muslim law on us""? Regardless of why they came there in the first place, once they were there, were they going to *send those Jews back to the countries that they themselves were displaced from, or where they were violently abused and watched their family members get killed?* Were they supposed to just leave and go back to those countries? Because that seems pretty anti-progressive to me.....

Okay, now let's go into some arguments that aren't necessarily related to the creation of Israel, but people may follow up with afterward that bring us back to the original point.  
After reading all of my arguments above, you might say, ""**Okay, but no state technically has a right to exist! A state just shouldn't have been created at all!""**  
Okay then, why am I not seeing you spending even a fraction of your time advocating for other countries to be dismantled? If you're spending this much time arguing that Israel shouldn't have been established because ""no state has the right to exist,"" I better see you arguing the same energy for all countries--especially other countries that are built on ""stolen land,"" as you say. (Reminder that Jews are also native to the region! Doesn't mean Palestinians aren't, but Jews are too!)  
Now in response to this, you might say **""The reason I'm not putting energy into dismantling other states is because they aren't committing atrocities the way Israel is! They've been killing and displacing Palestinians for decades now, and forcing them to live under apartheid!""**  
Israel has done some pretty atrocious sh\*t, I'm not going to deny that. There are several things that I seriously think they could have dealt with better. But, if you look at some of the things that have happened, there is almost *always* some type of explanation as to why Israel reacted the way they did. Going all the way back to how Arabs declared war on Jews in 1948 after the partition plan--the partition plan was created so that not a single Arab would have had to be displaced more than around two hours away from where they lived. But they declared war on Israel, Israel fought back, and as a result, several Palestinians were displaced either by Israeli paramilitary forces (who acted in terrible faith and were trying to get even more of the land, which they ultimately succeeded at), or were tricked out of their homes by Arab leaders who convinced them that they should leave and that they would get their homes back once the Jews were defeated. This entire war taking place right now is in response to the deadly attack on 10/7. I think that Israel has gone overboard with how they've reacted and has created a humanitarian crisis (though I'm not a military expert so I can't exactly say what they should have done differently), but do people really expect them to just not react *at all* after a terrorist attack like that? Also, all those checkpoints people complain about? The blockade? Those were created in response to suicide bombings that Palestine enacted on Israel, and rockets being fired into Israel from Gaza. Do you expect Israel to just not protect their citizens? Of course, some of it has gone way too far and can be argued as being collective punishment, but at the core, those things exist specifically to protect Israelis from being attacked, which I don't think any other country receives criticism for.  
And then if you say **""But Palestinians acted that way because they're oppressed! Occupied people have the right to exist the way they do! Again, they wouldn't be acting that way in the first place if Israel hadn't stolen their lands and displaced Palestinians from their homes!""**  
...then we're back to square one and you can go back to reading this post from the very beginning to see how this entire situation wasn't a ""stolen land"" situation and didn't really have a better way that it could have worked out.

So, if anyone actually has any ideas as to *what should have happened in 1948 instead of establishing the state of Israel*, I am seriously interested in possibly having my view changed.",Agtfangirl557,267,1306,1.0,0.31120694515919717,1709771863,/r/changemyview/comments/1b8gfs0/cmv_anyone_who_says_israel_should_never_have_been/,2024,3
1bioj6s,CMV: Libertarianism is perhaps one of the most naive viewpoints a person can have.,"To me it's pretty simple: people are selfish. If you know anything at all about human nature, you should know that humans are selfish people, that powerful people will use their power for their own ends if they can.

Libertarian belief is built around the assumption that if you allow people the freedom to regulate everything on their own, without any government intervention of any kind, we'll all be way better off. Blow away all regulations, any attempts by a greater entity to stop people from exploiting each other, and the end result will be a much better society where free markets have properly calibrated the value of everything and nobody will be exploiting each other at all!

Like, come on. You really don't think that someone's going to figure out a way to fleece you out of your money? We talk about roads a lot in reference to libertarianism, how ""we don't need the government to build roads for us"". Okay, let's say we leave road-building entirely to citizen-owned businesses. One particularly savvy roadbuilder figures out a way to convince people that HIS roads are better than everyone else's, and he succeeds. How / why? Because who gives a fuck about roads? Who is going to do their due diligence to know whether it's really true when a guy says ""well my road is made of 325X multi-plastinate gloobablop which is a far superior material""? Salesmen are great at convincing people that things are true when they probably just aren't, but if they succeed, voila, now they dominate the industry, and now that they've got all the money, they can probably use that money to shut down everyone else, out-advertise them, establish their monopoly, and now they can charge as much as they want to build their roads. You say that some other company can slide in with cheaper prices, but you're forgetting some really well-known things about humanity: people are stupid, people are lazy, people are suckers. The big monopoly company can easily push their own propaganda that their own material is superior and still have a stranglehold on the business.

I feel like anyone with the most basic understanding of humanity would understand why libertarianism would never work. That's why I've always viewed any libertarian as extremely naive and just not very smart, certainly not the least bit aware of how the world actually works.

1bqdcuj,"CMV: the normalization of online sex work/onlyfans is about as ""empowering"" as a beauty pageant.","Let me start out by saying that I'm not even necessarily anti-porn or anti-sex work at all, and in this economy I totally understand why a lot of girls feel compelled to make their money this way instead of submitting to what's essentially corporate wage slavery. My problem is not with sex work in and of itself, however, when this hustle is played off as something that's supposed to be liberating or empowering in any way shape or form is where I have to roll my eyes and draw the line.

I'm sorry, but there is nothing ""empowering"" about competitively capitalizing on how effectively your physical appearance can be fetishized and marketed in accordance with stringent hierarchical beauty standards.

1bmthzg,CMV: Insecurity is a perfectly valid reason to not want to date someone with an exceedingly high body count.,"I see this mentioned a lot when it comes to debates of whether or not a guy wants to date a woman that's been with a lot of men and had a ton of hookups, and I don't really see how that somehow makes it invalid to not want to date a woman over it. In fact it's pretty self aware and logical.

Insecurity is not a bad thing and it's something that all people have. Sex is an incredibly intimate and vulnerable act and men have the added factor of sexual performance is something that men are mocked for pretty regularly. This included getting mocked in a vacuum or getting compared to men your partner has been with before and coming up short (no pun intended) so it's not really a suprise that lots of guys would choose to be in a relationship where this isn't as much of an issue. 

Another aspect is that the types of guys that are able to have casual sex with women are typically incredibly conventionally attractive guys. Lots of average guys don't want to feel like they're being settled for when it comes to how sexually attractive they are to their partner, so if a woman doesn't have a sexually history that implies that, there's less of a reason to feel insecure.

If you as a man are deciding to not date a woman for one of these reasons you're not doing anything bad. You're not viewing a woman as less than for her sexual history, you're not taking out your feelings on your partner, the only thing you are doing is looking for a relationship you are comfortable in. I guess worst case scenario, you could be hypocritical if you have a high body count, but the guys that have 10+ body counts are the super conventionally attractive guys who I doubt are insecure and using more misogynistic reasons to justify not wanting to date a promiscuous woman",Tall_Promotion_7160,429,968,1.0,0.2850415948806301,1711309492,/r/changemyview/comments/1bmthzg/cmv_insecurity_is_a_perfectly_valid_reason_to_not/,2024,3
1bgukwq,CMV: Dating has become more of a chore than it supposedly being fun ,"Note: I am not American, so I am not basing culture culture off dating in America, but just generally about dating. 

Take a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/s/Eg6c0W7LEn) and you will see how taxing dating has become. 

Dating apps are basically useless for men, even for men who get some matches because women on dating apps aren’t even exactly looking to go on dates, at this point it seems like women are seeking validation and an ego boost from the tons of matches they get. 

The dating standards have become ludicrous at this point, and no, it is not “incel” to point out how the extremely high standards that a lot of women are holding for men is ridiculous. 

That’s the equivalent of me wanting a super model who vibes with me but I can’t even give anything in return. Thats exactly what dating has become now. Women seek men who are in the ‘top percentages’, but what do they provide in return? 

They are problematic and want to be treated like ‘passenger princesses’, and expect men to be both “modern and traditional” at the same time. 

Dating would have remained *simpler* if dating apps didn’t exist, but these dating apps and even social media has completely warped women’s minds because of the tons of attention women get from DM’s, and likes on Instagram and those sort. 

And a lot of the older men who will probably read this post will never understand the struggles of younger men today who are trying to date, because you never grew up in an era where women hold men to such ridiculous standards and even the average men are being seen as disposable and useless. 

At this point why even bother trying to date? Might as well stay single forever, focus on my career, take care of my parents and get a dog.

Change my view and tell me why dating isn’t a chore in today’s age, especially for younger men.

1b3neqm,CMV: Communism is not plausible and leads to totalitarianism ,"1. You cant have a stateless society because there needs to be a hierarchy. You need to have laws and regulation. So you need to have people enforcing those laws. By definition you would have state. If you have a group or people who are enforcers of laws then what is stopping them from encroaching on more power. 

2. No one is entitled to your goods and services. For example, if your home had an issue with your plumbing. Would you be entitled to someone else plumbing service? What if your home or business needed its roof repaired and it was big strenuous job. You can’t be entitled to someone’s else’s labor. Therefore they are going to name their price and highest payers get the services and communism falls apart.

3. Communism relies on perfect moral citizens to even be considered possible. You would need a crimeless society free of violence, theft, etc.. this is implausible and going back to reason number 1, because having perfect citizens and a society with no crime is implausible. You would need a hierarchy or state to enforce said laws and regulations, and controlling the means every thing. In a communist system, where the state controls the means of production and distribution, there is a centralization of authority. This concentration of power in the hands of the state can lead to a lack of checks and balances, creating an environment where a single party or leader can wield significant control.

1b7hpk5,CMV: Prostitution is not immoral. Prostitution should be legal.,"CMV: Prostitution should be legal. Prostitution itself is not immoral. 

I’ll start this by saying there is a difference between a willing prostitute/escort and a sex slave/human trafficking victim.

The whole prostitution industry should be legalized and regulated for harm reduction. I don’t think either side is evil just because the law states it is. At one point there were laws that were horrific and immoral but still the law-doesn’t mean they are right. If it was legalized, there will still probably be a black market and nefarious players in the game but legalizing it and having safer alternatives to the current situation is ideal and would reduce harm.
Pimps would have less leverage and escorts would be safer and could make a living in peace. 

A common argument I see people make is that prostitute addicts are using the money to score drugs so it’s wrong. 

1.) Not all escorts are addicts. Some of them just want money, new designer bags and material expenses to be covered. They can use their looks and sexuality because it has value. Much like how a beautiful actor or model can cash in on their appearance they should be able to do the same without the same ridicule and law enforcement threat.

2.) This common argument falls flat because there are addicts working 9-5 construction jobs, working as strippers, bartenders, bankers, lawyers and none of those professions and employers come under the same scrutiny the same way for “feeding an addiction. Addiction is a brutal lifestyle that effects everyone from every industry and all walk of life but it is on people to not do dope and if they are already on it, it’s their sole responsibility to get clean. Addiction is often rooted in trauma and I do have empathy and can understand that and feel bad for people in grips of that life but I do not think it warrants keeping the sex industry illegal. I don’t see the correlation. 

You can have sex, that’s fine.
You can pay people to do stuff, that’s also fine. But the second you pay someone to have safe sex it becomes wrong and illegal in societies eyes. The buyers and sellers of this industry should be protected.

It’s somehow legal to pay people to have sex but only if you’re recording it and making porn? The rules around it are not sound is what I’m saying therefore it should be updated and legalized for the safety and wellbeing of everyone involved. Is it the best thing you could be doing? No. But neither is drinking alcohol, smoking, gambling etc. We’ve legalized many vices that are arguably more harmful. I’m open to having my mind changed but as of right now I don’t really see a big issues with sex work.

1b5fuky,CMV: Biden is the Best Option,"
It's insane reading the amount of anti biden comments and folks spewing disinformation about Biden. Don't vote for biden but don't spew disinformation. 

-seems like alot of folks don't realize biden got the railroads workers paid sick leave the following year by threatening to withhold federal money from the railroads. 

-Biden saved the pension fund of over 350k union employees by issuing the biggest bailout in decades. Big banks always get bailed out and workers get thrown to the curb. This cost tens of billions of dollars and NEVER happens

-bidens FTC was the first FTC to successfully block a corporate merger cuz it would hurt labor and they changed the merger guidelines to ensure any mergers moving forward can't hurt labor. This is biggest thing the FTC could've done. They just blocked the Kroger merger this week in the name of labor . 

-bidens NLRB is the most pro union agency in over 50+ years. Jennifer abruzo bringing back the silk doctrine is the most pro union action action the nlrb has done in 50+ years 

- biden has required federal infrastructure projects (50k+ projects) to be done by union labor only or collective bargaining agreement 

- bidens EEOC nd NLRB have ruled more in favor for employees versus employers than any other time in history 

-bidens inflation reduction act has brought hundreds of thousands of new union jobs into the mix as folks are needed to install heat pumps and solar panels 

-Folks here don't realize how big of a deal it is to have a NLRB that's in your favor. I had a cousin who recently got her job back cuz the agency ruled in her favor for a union busting tactic her employer tried deploying. The ONLY federal agency that protects our job is the NLRB. It's like having a insurance plan on your job. When you get fired or something bad happens you want THE BEST nlrb to save your ass which is what we have RIGHT NOW.

Biden is old as hell but he's easily been the most pro union president we've ever had in 50+ years.   We have the lowest unemployment rate in history.  Biden created so many jobs with his infrastructure bill.  Biden is not the orange man who tried to overthrow our government and is a threat to our democracy.  Biden respects and understands what a democracy is.  Trump idolizes dictators.  The choice is easy.  Everyone needs to vote for him to keep our country strong and save democracy.

I've been working for 40+ years now and I've seen people get unjustly fired for all kinds of shit. Sometimes for even just doing their jobs. 

I’ve done some human resources as well, within a few of my rules, and I’ve been asked to do some very unsavory things, like do a PIP plan for somebody they just don’t like, or for other reasons I won’t mention. If an employer doesn’t like you for whatever reason, they can just do up a PIP plan and you’re out a week later. And you’ve got no leg to stand on. You could even be doing your job, and they will let you go.

America is the only country that has Atwill employment. We are so behind and we favor the employer so much, that it puts everyone else at risk. Fuck that.

Unemployment only lasts so long and getting a job with the same salary as your previous one can take some time (years for some people).

The fact that you can get fired for sneezing the wrong way is bullshit. If you live in a state with at will employment laws you can be terminated at any time, for any reason and sometimes no reason at all. I live in Texas, and they can fire you for whatever reason. Even if the boss is sexually harassing you, even if they don’t like the color of your skin, no lawyer will help you at all and it will cost thousands and thousands of dollars even begin to sue the company, and most of the time you just lose, because you can never prove it.

Don't get me wrong, I've seen this go the other way too, where company's are too lax on problem employees and let them hang around. I just don't think with how much most people dedicate their lives to their jobs that they can just be let go for no reason and pretty much no recourse.

I think there should be an independent employment agency that deals with employee lay offs and terminations. For example, it would be like civil court, where a judge/jury looks at the facts from both parties (employer and employee) and then makes a decision from there. I know you can sue in civil court for wrongful termination, but having an agency strictly dedicated to employment issues would be more helpful for the average person (you have to have deep pockets to sue, and most people don't have that).

Side unpopular opinion: You shouldn't have to give two weeks notice before you move on from your job. If your company can dump you at any moment without telling you, the social expectation should be the other way as well.

1bnolej,CMV: Russia cannot win the war in Ukraine at this point.,"So by victory I mean achieving objectives, which we should consider at the start of the invasion, when the intention was to take Kyiv and install a puppet government, and to take much of Ukraine. 

But to expand on that, long term what could Russia's reduced goals be considered? A smaller area of Ukraine? Slowing the spread of NATO? ""de-nazification?""

I contend that in the long run none of these will happen in a way that Russia desires. To change my view on this you will need to convince me that Russia can achieve their military goals in Ukraine.

Don't come at me with Russia adjusting their goals and claiming victory, like ""well we didn't want Ukraine anyway, and our goal was to cause NATO to expand"", I am not buying that.

Here goes:

Russia on offense:

* Russian military doctrine is terrible at projecting power. Russia uses old soviet military doctrine, which is to defend the homeland on the cheap. More lower end tanks, more lower end artillery, more lower end aircraft, etc. Fewer support trucks per battalion, instead moving men, machine and supplies by rail inside Russia, And not going for air dominance but airspace denial. Using robust SAMs to deny airspace once the ground has taken.
* Russian logistics are worse than Russian military doctrine. This is the ability to provide reinforcements, ammunition, food, and other supplies to those fighting the war. Omar Bradley once said amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics, and he was correct. Keeping the war machine moving takes good logistics, and Russia is garbage at it.
* Russian maintenance practices are marred by corruption and inefficiency. Corruption has caused needed maintenance not to happen, or to be underfunded after theft of funding. And this has caused Russia to have more failures than expected in ordinance (at one point 60% of Russia's guided missiles failed to launch, target or detonate) or in equipment. (Russia has had a staggering failure rate on vehicles and aircraft. You have to do the wrench work, and Russia doesn't do it well.
* Russia's losses have been severe. Not just in human losses, having lost more soldiers to being killed or wounded, having lost perhaps 400,000 soldiers to being wounded or killed. (now more than the USA has lost in all wars going back to WW2, and now they are going into WW2 in terms of US losses) and Russia has endured. In terms of vehicles the losses are perhaps more damaging, as replacement is not as easy as another round of conscription, where we now see Russia sending T54/55 tanks into Ukraine, tanks built in 1948. Russian losses so far, per Oryx, who verifies losses via images or video:

2856 tanks  
  
1273 armored fighting vehicles  
  
3677 infantry fighting vehicles  
  
418 armored personnel carriers  
  
3175 trucks  
  
353 towed artillery   
  
706 self propelled artillery  
  
361 multiple rocket launchers  
  
106 aircraft  
  
135 helicopters  
  
21 naval ships and submarines

That is a large amount off loss for Russia, a country not able to replace their losses.

https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\_of\_the\_Russo-Ukrainian\_War

So militarily, Russia cannot project power well, and has gone about as far as they are going to go in terms of offensive actions. Russia will struggle to go any farther, and the harder they push the worse the losses will be. Will they run out of soldiers? No, but they will run out of equipment for those soldiers. As much as it was a shock to see two US sourced Bradley's kill a modern Russian T-90, a Russian T62 or T54/55 has no place on a modern battlefield, they will not last long in combat.

So that is the ability for Russia to go on offense, now let's talk Russia on defense:

* Russian defensive ability is better than their offensive ability, and it isn't close. Now their artillery and their mines have much more value, and the S400 and S500 systems are quite good, and they can deny the airspace near the front to non-stealthy Ukrainian aircraft.

If Ukraine attacks these defenses, Ukraine will take much larger losses than when defending against Russian offenses. They can and should keep fighting, but carefully, as to prevent as many losses as possible.

But in the long run, the Russian defensive ability wont save them. First, Russia hasn't achieved their goals, right now if it all ended Russia didn't achieve their goals and lost a staggering amount, right now it would be a loss if Russia didn't go back on offense...and if they did it would be a terrible idea for them.

Why wont Russian defensive capability save them? Let's talk some reality. First, if Ukraine can destroy the Kerch Strait bridge, they probably take Crimea through siege. Russia feeds and arms their forces in Crimea using that bridge, and without it their ability to continue that (bearing in mind poor Russian logistics) are compromised. Sending those supplies across the water cannot possible support their forces there and can also be targeted, and sending them through contested Ukraine is quite a lot farther and more costly, and is also in danger in the parts of Ukraine it would have to drive through.

That is Crimea eventually falling. It is a matter of when, not if.

Now the parts of Ukraine with a direct land connection to Russia? That is much more problematic. For Ukraine to take that would take military capability Ukraine, but in the end if those areas are returned to Ukraine (and again, keeping those areas is not a victory for Russia, I am speculating in what a full victory for Ukraine would look like) it will not be because they were lost militarily.

Why? Let's talk sanctions:

The sanctions are doing more than you might think. Russia is hurting. Russia is buying artillery shells from North Korea and drones from Iran, nations Russia used to supply, now they are a customer. That speaks to Russia's military industry. Russia cannot build Armada tanks to send into war, they are sending T54/55s built in 1948. And Russia cannot build more SU-57's, an aircraft not seen over Ukraine. 

Russia is mainly selling gas and oil to China and India, and they are selling it for currency that only buys goods and services from China and India. That will not help them to win the war. 

So as long as the sanctions continue, Russia's clock is ticking. They can put off the inevitable, but in the end Russia will have to abandon this war that they started. Economics demand it.

Will the sanctions end? No, not until the war ends, and not for a while after that. So the west will keep the sanctions up for as long as it takes, as that serves the interests of the west. 

Will the military aid end? No. It will slow, but we are still talking about spares, older weapons systems and ammunition which is not front of the line for NATO. This is an investment for the west into Russian defeat, and the harder Russia loses, the more secure the west is when this war is over. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, lets talk about the reality of the situation for Russia:

Russia is sending T54/55s into war, Ukraine is now sending Abrams, Leopards and Challengers. Russia cannot take steps forward, their ability to project power is a joke. Russia is getting hit at home by Ukraine, and now by terrorists. And now NATO has expanded, now closer to Russia than ever, now covering both sides of the exit from St. Petersburg, making getting submarines out in a stealthy way more difficult for Russia. And in the end Ukraine has kept fighting, and the west has kept supporting them.

Russia has succeeded to the greatest extent that they are able to militarily and economically, and can go no further, and cannot be said to have won this war.   


And the future is more bleak for Russia than the present.

&#x200B;

So please, change my view on this if you can. Convince me that it is possible for Russia to achieve their military objectives in Ukraine.",TheMikeyMac13,487,683,1.0,0.24448553464748396,1711399767,/r/changemyview/comments/1bnolej/cmv_russia_cannot_win_the_war_in_ukraine_at_this/,2024,3
1b56cgq,CMV: climbing Mount Everest is worthless and shows a level of narcissism and selfishness,"Climbing Mount Everest is a useless accomplishment and also shows a level of narcissism and selfishness, that people need to recognize. 

Basically, climbing Mount Everest achieves nothing practical. If people went up to Mount Everest to research things or collect things I could respect it more. I get that it is technically an achievement since it's hard, but it's such a ridiculous risk to your life and well-being. I think the main thing that bothers me is that you are risking your life for something so worthless. If you are going to risk your life for something, go become a firefighter or donate your kidney.

Things like: writing a book, completing a degree, knitting a shirt, cooking a meal, or getting a driver's licence have an end result. You've either made something or learned something. 

Whereas climbing Mount Everest is just literally going up somewhere and then coming back down. It's about as practical as going up the stairs, standing there for five seconds and then coming back down, and repeating the process ten thousand times. Except by doing that I don't risk dying.

I can sort of appreciate people who run marathons. I mean, it's equally useless, but it's far more safe I'm not necessarily against people doing something useless for fun but I'm just  wondering if it is the best use of your time. 

Mount Everest has a death rate of between one to five percent of all climbers. That is just the number of deaths of people who attempt to climb at all. Of the people who manage to make it past 8000m, 14 % die. 

For comparison:

running a marathon kills 1 in 259,000 of all who attempt it. 

Skydiving kills 1 in 500,000 of all who attempt it. 

Boxing is the second most deadly sport at 1 death per 7000. 

Climbing Mount Everest has a death rate of 1 in 50, and it increases to 1 in 10 once you approach the summit. 

The risk vs. reward does not pan out. A 1 in 10 chance of death just so you can say ""I climbed Mount Everest.” IT’s narcissistic and selfish and should not be rewarded.

1bkcjwv,CMV: Russian propaganda machine holds a major role in the pro-Palestinian movement,"**To start with, this is not a debate praising or critisizing any faction belonging to Palestine, Israel, Russia or the West.** There is a lot of misinformation circulating on all sides and I'm trying to avoid sourcing any unfounded statements/articles.

 My argument is that it is in Russia's leadership's interest to desguise their attempts of destabilization of Western leadership by disguising their propaganda in criminalising Western support for Israel. 

Let's take the US as a first point of discussion. A good portion of the left wing leaning people who would likely vote for Biden are reconsidering their vote accusing him for complicity in what they call genocide commited by Israel against Palestinians, since the current US administration has been maintaing the strong military cooperation with Israeli Defence Forces. Despite the financial contributions the US along with its European partners pay to the Palestinian territories ([US gov fact sheet](https://www.state.gov/u-s-support-for-the-palestinian-people/) from 2022), this hardly gets mentioned in the media, be it mainstream or the independent sources that make it to the wider public. While the Biden administration loses credibility among the demographic that supports him and often seems to take action or at least make statements responding to this political pressure in a way to keep his electorate, Trump is out there telling the public that he is a man of peace and that all wars will end the day he takes the presidential office. It goes without saying that Trump holds the more NATO-skeptic view of the two presidential candidates, especially after statements such as only defending countries that meet a budgeting criteria and continous efforts to stop aid to Ukraine which plays in Russia's benefit. 

Same goes in the UK (where I live). I know a lot of people who are promoting boycotts on companies that are in any way related with either Israel or the United States and are criminalising the current conservative leadership for their support for Israel. Despite the internal power struggles, the British Conservative Party has maintained its role as one of Ukraine's closest partners since the 2022 full scale invasion of Ukraine, so once again the public losing trust in the leadership could potentially lead to a change in the UK's foreign policy that might affect Ukraine negatively and thus, Russia positevely.

As for Russia's position on the Israel-Hamas war, we have Sergey Lavrov (Russia's foreign minister) taking [a clear stance](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FEoobEVZfRY) way before Oct 7, we have a souring relationship between Israel and Russia, and we have a [peace convention](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/29/palestinian-unity-on-agenda-as-hamas-fatah-leaders-to-meet-in-moscow) between Palestinian factions held very recently in Moscow.

My last argument is a clear record of Russian propaganda diguising itself in various forms of activism. In my home country (Romania) there is a popular far right party called AUR (Alliace for Union of Romanians) whose claimed main objective is the unification of Romania and the Republic of Moldova to regain historical borders. However, their leader (George Simion) has interdiction to enter both the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine (both have territories under Russian military occupation) because authorities from both countries deemed him as an asset of Russian propaganda. Members of AUR have claimed that Romania should set as an objective to take the territories from Ukraine that host Romanian ethnics. Despite AUR's claimed ideology, their actions align more with Russia's interest and they even got themselves the nickname 'Alliance for Union with Russia'. Also, there have been multiple claims of Russian involvement with environmental activists and NGOs to shift public view in their favour, such as [influencing European public against internally sourced gas exploitaitions, in order to keep Europe dependent on Russian gas.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/19/russia-secretly-working-with-environmentalists-to-oppose-fracking) Therefore I believe Russia will hide behind any side of the political spectrum to manipulate the people in the West.  


This is not to say that people who express their support and concern for the Palestinian cause are ill intended, however I think at least some of the information on the they are receiving and forwarding is playing in Russia's interests and it makes sense for Russia to invest into this information/misinformation capital.   


As a sidenote, I have travelled to both Israel and West Bank zone A (full Palestinian Authority control) a couple of weeks ago. While the main focus of my visit was on historical/archeological sites, the subject of the current conflict was unavoidable. The views on the conflict that were shared with me by Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs and Palestinians do not reflect anything that I have read or heard in the West, no matter from what side of the dispute. It was as if here in the West we are talking about a different conflict and it made me even more skeptical about how I read into news regarding external affairs. However, my CMV is about what gets to the wider public rather than debating on the actual tensions, therefore I kept my views and experiences on the matter out of my arguments.",motoci,420,732,1.0,0.23803996151522608,1711043129,/r/changemyview/comments/1bkcjwv/cmv_russian_propaganda_machine_holds_a_major_role/,2024,3
1bgdwgz,CMV: Israel is responsible for providing and allowing sufficient aid into Gaza,"1. When a party occupies the territory of another party, the occupier has the responsibility to provide aid to the civilians. Israel is no exception. They have air superiority and significant IDF presence in Gaza, they are occupying Gaza and therefore they have the responsibility to provide aid. America provided sufficient aid to Afghanistan and Iraq when they invaded those countries, and Israel is no exception.

2. The only reliable way to let aid in is through the land crossings, which Israel has a monopoly over. Even though Egypt technically controls the Rafah crossing, nothing can go through without Israel's green light. It's Israel's responsibility to make sure aid from other countries are allowed into Gaza.

Does Hamas has some responsibility too? Yes, but it's unlikely that they have enough aid to provide for millions of Gazans, and they don't control the land borders like Israel does. 

The situation on the ground is absolutely dire and desperate. Not providing or at least allowing sufficient aid into Gaza is immoral and inhumane. It amounts to at best collective punishment, at worst genocidal (a word I don't use lightly).

I'd like to hear why Israel doesn't have that responsibility or if they do, why they don't have to fulfill it.",WheatBerryPie,337,805,1.0,0.23239415568433536,1710617021,/r/changemyview/comments/1bgdwgz/cmv_israel_is_responsible_for_providing_and/,2024,3

1b3k8ea,CMV: Arab Fundamentalist are the reason for the Israel-Gaza crisis. ,"In 1915, the region known as Palestine today still had ties to the Ottoman Empire. It wasn’t until the start of WW1 (1914) that the European nations began to consider who would control the Arab regions of the Middle East after their eventual win in WW1.

The Sykes Picot agreement in 1916, two years before WWI ended was between France and England. It declared that what is considered today Southern Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Parts of Iraq would be under control of the United Kingdom. France would control parts of Turkey, Syria and Lebanon. Prior to Sykes Picot, these “States” didn’t really have borders. Under the Ottoman Empire, borders weren’t really a thing. The Empire ruled from 1299 to 1922.

When WWII ended, Zionist in France and England deemed giving European & Middle Eastern Jews a state of the their own. They proceeded to arbitrarily draw borders. When Israel was formed in 1948, France was the primary supplier of weapons and investment. In fact, France provided Israel with their nuclear capability. France built their first nuclear reactor and gave them the bomb. In Exchange, Israeli mercenaries fought against a revolution in French controlled Algeria and France received economic benefits from selling and staffing their nuclear facilities.

Around this time, the Secular State of Egypt began their occupation of Gaza (1949 to 1956). Temporarily lost after ATTACKING Israel, again, in what is called the Second Arab Israeli War. Egypt’s military did not grant the Palestinian people independence, they occupied them. Then Egypt and consortium of nearby Arab nations attacked Israel again over the Suez Canal Crisis, which initiated the real conflict in the region…control over the economies of the region by controlling the shipping channels. Egypt had the control. President Nasser of Egypt in 1956 declared the Suez Canal a Nationalized and private resource, blocking a MAJOR shipping channel. Europe demanded shipping access, and Israel had threatened prior to 1956 that preventing the shipment of goods (without goods, you starve…like we Gaza today) to their country was an act of war and would deem a response.

Israel went on the attack and took control of Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt folded and signed a treaty to get back Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for access to the Straits of Tiran for shipping. Egypt would maintain control of the canal. Israel left Gaza and the Sinai after occupying for under a year. Egypt’s control and occupation resumed in Gaza and lasted until 1967, when once again, President Nasser of Egypt thought it wise to force of closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping. Israel attacked Egypt immediately on the Sinai Peninsula. Other Arab nations including Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon attacked Israel’s other borders. In Six Days, Israel captured the entire Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, Egyptian Occupied Gaza, the Jordanian Occupied West Bank, and the Syrian Occupied Golan Heights.

Egypt’s president Nasser resigned, and was propelled back into office. Egypt maintained a canal blockade leading to the 1970s energy crisis and the 1973 oil crisis

President Anwar el-Sedat signed the Egypt-Israel peace treaty in 1979, and relations were normalized after turbulent economic years due to the energy crisis. It was all over the control of Oil. The entire match of chess between the west, the Middle East and Russia. 

President Sedat was assassinated in 1981 by Egyptian Fundamentalist army officers. This was the beginning of Fundamentalist Islamic rule under President Mubarak who ruled until the Egyptian revolution in 2011. The Fundamentalist are the head cases we have today in the governments Syria, Yemen and the likes of Libya. Evil people in power. Pure evil. If there was a Satan, it would be Islamic Fundamentalist (or Putin). The kind of people who see a beheading as a normal act of control. 

Israel withdrew from all of Gaza in 2005 until the cycle of Palestinian suicide bombings, rocket attacks and knife attacks sparks a military-police state response from Israel. Now, Israeli citizens were growing into Warhawk nationalists under Netanyahu. They were hitting back harder. Palestinians threw rocks, Israel shot back. Tensions continued to grow and Iran saw opportunity to fund a military presence to actuate a proxy war with Israel. Israel responded with civil rights abuses, allowed for more settlements, and created a blockade on goods to the region. The surrounding Arab nations of pissed, but wouldn’t help the Palestinians as they never did before either. They all start increasing terrorist activities via Iran. Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. 

After Israel left Gaza in 2005, the region’s terrorists saw it as a success and increased activities. Gaza elected Hamas as their government in 2006. This brings us to today, my friend. The Palestinians people have been used as pawns for over 60 years passing hands between Arab control and Israeli retaliation, terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens by Iranian backed militias and severe Israeli retaliation…to the point where we have the human rights crisis on our hands. There is only one solution, eradicate terrorism and teach Israel to find its heart.

1bez3lx,"CMV: The majority of incels aren't bad people, just guys that were dealt a bad hand in life and get mocked for it.","I think the way that ""incel"" is now becoming common insult against any man (regardless of whether or not he's an incel) is pretty concerning and demonizes a lot of men who just happen to be in a bad position.

For young people, an increasing number of men are being completely shut out of the dating field. Dating is becoming more superficial and more and more men are failing to meet the cut. If you look at statistics on young people dating, somehow a significantly larger amount of women are actively dating than men. I'm not going to say this is unfair, because it's not. It's not unfair for women to choose whoever they want to date. That being said, that doesn't really mean anything for how the men that are unable to date feel. Again, I'm not saying these men are entitled to women, but desire and negative emotions out of being unable to fulfill those desires are not going to go away just because you aren't entitled to women.

Men are romantically lonely. I know many people will say to just build friendships, but if friendships were enough for humans, no one would likely take the risk it is to get romantically entangled with someone. Most humans have a desire for romantic companionship, and in the world we live in some people just won't get that. For a lot of men, I would argue through no fault of their own. People will fight me on this and say ""if you can't find a girlfriend or can't get laid it's you're fault"" but I would like to ask a question. 

Do you think that it is possible for bad things to happen to people who do everything in their power to be good and do things right? Can a person who did everything right at their job, came in early, stayed late, and worked hard still be laid off? Of course they can. Unless you don't believe that, it's not consistent to think the same can't apply to dating. Life's just not fair, you can do everything right and still fail.

At the end of the day humans are animals and in the animal world, only the genetic best get to have partners. Sure humans deviated from that, but only after men practically enslaved women and made it so they couldn't survive in society without a father or husband and could be sold to men like cattle. It's not like that anymore and as a result, the more ""human"" dating practices are reemerging.

Some people are just dealt shitty hands and end up involuntarily celibate. Being an incel doesn't inherently mean you're a misogynist.  Hell the person who coined the term was a woman. Yet being an incel and incels are seen as punching bags and insult fodder even if they're not misogynistic. I've seen people telling just guys on reddit they look like incels. You can't tell me that they were trying to say they look like misogynists when many attractive men are also misogynists. They're talking about virginity and being unable to attract a partner.

The future impact this sort of work has on your body after decades of wear and tear is astonishing. 

The medical bills and terminal pain that physical labourers experience in their old age is NOT worth getting paid minimum in their youth. Minimum wage is not worth the cost of the medical bills they will be experiencing in the future.

I have the opinion that people working on the loading dock and busting their butts deserve to be compensated the same as someone like a banker, a lawyer, or even a neurosceintist. It’s not fair that physical labourers get paid insanely less, but then also have to deal with expensive medical bills in the future. I can see why Lenin or Karl Marx had the opinions they had, it’s because their way of thinking is a lot more fair for **EVERYONE** . I can imagine people being against a communist system if they were born into privledge, and don’t want to share their wealth.

I happen to work at a loading dock for Walmart and this job is nothing like I expected. When you receive a job offer from the #1 company on the Fortune 500 list, you expect the job to be at least decently cushy, and to compensate well. That’s not the case. My co-workers recently informed me that we make the absolute bare-minimum income that they can legally pay us in this province. It’s a living heck hole in that loading dock area and most of my co-workers are at the bottom of society, barely scraping together a living. Tell me how the CEO can make millions of dollars while we’re working harder than him?! How does that make sense. This isn’t happening just with Walmart too, this is many billion dollar companies around the world.

I want to abolish the far-right economic system we have right now, and I want to bring in more aspects of communism. That doesn’t mean I want to be full communist but I do want workers to be compensated like it is a communist society. There is no way that you can tell me a banker works harder than I do, when I’m sweating my balls off carrying 50-100 lb boxes, **MY ENTIRE 6 HOUR SHIFT** . Professional athletes get paid millions for training everyday and there’s an argument that me and my co-workers are arguably putting our bodies through much much worse, but get compensated so much less. 

Lebron James makes $45 million a year. He plays roughly 100 games in a season (including playoffs), and each game is 48 minutes. 100 x 48 = 4800 minutes. 45 million / 4800min = $9374/minute.

$9375 x 60 min = $562,500/hour

That’s how much Lebron gets paid. Now let’s calculate how much I get paid per hour compared to him, and why don’t you capitalistic, fantastical economic ‘geniuses’ explain how that’s fair. Spoiler alert, #ITS NOT . But I digress. 

$15/562,500 x 100 = 0.00266%

**Let me say that again for the neoconservatists in the back** . My salary is 0.00266% of Lebrons. And all he does is throw a rubber ball through a metal ring… it’s complete bush league.

I’d like someone to argue against the fact that physical labour jobs need a LOT more compensation, and that a communist economic system is a lot more fair than a ‘free market’ one. I’m not saying we should be getting paid the exact same as Lebron James or a neuroscientist but it shouldn’t be anywhere near what it is now, and it frankly shouldn’t be anything past double our salary. Because there is no argument for them working double as hard as me, when I’m working as hard as I possibly can every day. I work so hard that I have been taking adhd pills from my coworkers every shift just to get through it. 

P.S. it’s funny that they call it a ‘free market economic system’ when I’m literally a slave to the system, sacrificing my youth and body for chump change. Us physical labourers are anything but free.

1bik8yd,CMV: Arabs/Muslims are the colonizers and privileged group throughout the entire Middle East ,"So in the west we see white Christian’s hold this status of power in society. 

We see the same in the Middle East with Muslims/arabs. There are so many minority groups that have been persecuted and simply exterminated throughout the Middle East through Islamization and arabization. Assyrians, Kurds, Christians, Zoroastrians, bahais, coptics, Druze, etc. 

We see these groups having to hide their identities

It’s interesting because we often paint the Arabs/muslims with the same brush as people of color and oppressed minorities. We also say that Arabs lived in peace over there until the west got involved, but cmon that is so far from the truth. There has been war and ethnic cleansing in the Arab world since forever. Christianity was the main culprit for awhile until Islam took over then Christianity again then Islam again. And now it’s mainly Muslim. Except for one controversial state (Israel) 

Arabs have been colonizing the berbers in North Africa and Kurds in Iraq, Syria and Iran. 

So although the onset and creation of the state of Israel is controversial, it is interesting to see how many minority groups in the Middle East actually support Israel, unlike the average Muslim/arab in the Middle East. Sure, Israel was made by Ashkenazi Jews, but many many Jews all over the Middle East found refuge in the state of Israel. And why is it through out the Middle East we see Muslim controlled countries. They are not democracies, and if they are, they severely restrict rights and Islam is very much the ruling power. (Albeit a few) 

You may argue and say “that is their culture and we should respect it” but that is the majority (now) culture, that isn’t the only culture/religion/ethnic group.

Arabs have a history of brutal slavery and colonization. So why do we often group them in with oppressed group? 

(Gaza is a different scenario, as they are clearly oppressed today. But again, they were used as pawns by the Arab world to prevent a minority group from gaining any power … the jews) 

And let’s not forget about dhimmi hood in the Islamic religion, anyone who ain’t Muslim is seen as a second class citizen and isn’t represented, pays jizzyah tax, etc.

1b86sfc,"CMV: if you want to practice the extreme version of your religion, move to those countries who allow it ","
Why do you move to let’s say Norway and you’re an extreme Orthodox Jew, Sharia supporting Muslim and want to imply your rules and living standard to that country? 

Why can’t you adapt since you want to move elsewhere, you can’t move to a not so religious country and then want certain areas to be for different genders, have different clothings etc and create a whole different culture in that country, why don’t you just move to those countries that allow such things?

Like for example in Iran there’s tons of women who want to get the fuck out because of the discrimination towards womens freedoms and rights, yet people want to imply those rules in other non religion countries.  

There’s people who are sadly born into these extreme religions and are brainwashed into thinking it’s ok and normal to for example hide your whole face, not being in the same room, area or restaurant with the opposite gender and now we’ve created a bigger segregation between the ethnic group and those people (when I saw ethnic group I include those who have immigrated but have adapted to the country’s culture and values)

Like for example here in London people want sharia law and that for example says that if a woman gets raped then there needs to be 4 male witnesses or else it’s invalid. There’s people who are born in a country who doesn’t have these values but are still brainwashed into thinking it’s okay and I think you should move to that country that allows it and let those who want to escape such living situations escape it. 

I can’t tell you how many people have been killed in non religious countries because their sister had a boyfriend or because they didn’t cover their knees like are you serious.

To be honest I think you should only be allowed to practice your religion behind closed doors and not bring it to the public, and if you don’t like it why not move? I don’t want to hear prayers, see discriminatory clothes and eventually dangerous laws.

1bapzpn,CMV: Most people in the US are completely deranged about sex and nudity,"The title speaks for itself really, but to elaborate:

* Most Americans have negative overreactions to sex and nudity that are disconnected from any potential harm.
* While sex and nudity can cause harm, e.g. a flasher is sexually harassing people, not everyone who is nude is a flasher. Being able to differentiate nonsexual nudity from sexual nudity and from someone using nudity to harass is a skill most Americans lack.
* This lack of differentiation then gets scaremongered into overreactive policies and everyone being accused of being a sexual predator, in a similar way to 9/11 lead to random innocent people being accused of being terrorists and security theater becoming the norm, with the usual preoccupation with protecting 'normal Americans' from outsiders via norms and propriety - ""we don't do that here"" - rather than real harm reduction focused on real threats.
* Children are as usual weaponized as an excuse to police the actions of others, instead of teaching children age appropriate lessons about sex and nudity to prepare them for public life.
* Not talking openly about sexuality nor educating people beyond the mechanics of sex leads to many Americans not understanding what their own sexuality is and being unable to understand sensual, sexual or romantic expression and how these interact with the public realm.
* This becomes a cultural vicious circle: people are told nudity is bad, told that it's not normal, so they don't expect it, so they feel surprised and scared by it, so they feel it's bad.
* Younger Americans are often additionally hamstrung by absorbing discourse around private sexual consent that does not include the public sphere, leading them to think that they can 'not consent' to other people doing things they don't want to see. Combined with young people's general distaste for older bodies, this becomes ""that old person is creepy"" as code for accusing them of sexual harassment.
* Some in the US kink communites have tried to assuage the fears of the average American, unfortunately lending them further confidence that they are correct because the kink community 'agrees' with them, ignoring that this came from pragmatism.
* The US rightwing are even more poisonous with their fears about sexuality, even going so far as thinking dancing in public is evidence of pedophilia if they think the dancing is too sexy (or black).
* People in other countries are also just as bad as the US or worse; this post isn't saying *only* the USA has issues with puritanism.

Also, while CMV is generally above ad homs, they seem to be particularly tempting for this topic so it's probably worth mentioning I am not a nudist, nor involved in any public sexual acts.

1bjx989,CMV: my ancestors owned slaves and I don’t really care. ,"So I’m talking about US slavery here in case that needs to be said. I grew up always knowing this, but I was confused why my mom seemed particularly ashamed of the fact that one of her ancestors owned slaves. 

The matter came up in conversation recently and some peers were kind of astonished that this isn’t something I feel a need to “make right,” or feel really anything about whatsoever. My ancestors owning slaves is a statement of basic fact that I don’t feel any real connection to whatsoever.

The idea that I’d even consider this to have any connection to or influence over my life is frankly absurd to me. One of my friends was even saying how like his brother in law or something found and reached out to descendants of slaves his family owns, I can’t even bring myself to explain the violations of privacy and just general pointlessness I see in this action. 

I am going to make the following general statements, which I hold to be true, to help clarify some things. The first two shouldn’t need clarification but I don’t want to have to type them out later:

1. My ancestors committed a horrible crime.

2. Slavery is evil. 

3. Modern black people in America suffer from lingering effects of centuries of slavery. 

4. “Slaves” is plural in the post, we are talking about a lot of slaves. This was a southern aristocratic family whose name is on the constitution, several people have Wikipedia articles and were involved in state government. Big time slave owners. 

As for why I don’t care: I cannot point to any direct influence this has had on my life. As far as I am aware, my specific lineage was disinherited. I grew up in a rather typical middle class family. The slave owners’ nonexistent influence over my life obviously dwarfs the influence I ever had over their actions. 


If one could assign an exact dollar amount to which I have benefited then I’d be willing to have a more serious inquiry into whether I owe anything to anybody. Any “debt” I have is basically completely speculative, and I really emphatically doubt any action on my end would ever be viewed as a complete atonement anyway. 

Moreover, I really doubt that anyone’s lineage is really completely perfectly morally upstanding by modern standards if you start going back 5 generations anyway. Two wrongs don’t make a right, but the history of mankind is really a history of oppression and exploitation. I don’t view this as anything terribly different than what groups have done, or would have gladly done if given the chance, throughout all of human history.

1bp73vl,CMV: Online dating is dead.,"I feel like I tried all sorts of apps for about two years - Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, OKCupid, CoffeeMeetsBagel, and even FaceBook Dating. But the results were consistent regardless of the platform, where likes/matches were so rare, I never even got to plan a date. Furthermore, I've grown more and more doubtful that it's just me. I've been hearing many anecdotes, for what those are worth, that suggest that online dating in general has been downhill.

Plus, most apps have been bought out by MatchGroup, a publicly-traded company that's lost over 75% in stock price value since the vaccines rolled out in 2021. Indeed, when a company is ostensibly offering a service that's suppose to help people connect even in a basic way, but then rolls out a fourth paid subscription tier for Tinder that costs $500 per month, then I'm not sorry for thinking that they may not have my social/romantic interests in mind.

So, I've personally written off the whole concept, even though I do have at least three relatives that've met their partner via an app, albeit years ago. But this year, I'm ready to try other ways of meeting people, like volunteering, checking out events held at art galleries, film festivals, and more.

Now, if you can convince me that online dating is still alive in some way - or at least somehow hasn't gotten worse over the last three years - then I'd be genuinely impressed. I also don't want to hear any gaslighting that claims that I'm overrating my attractiveness; even if I was in denial, is attractiveness not subjective, at least to some degree? Now, I'm not gonna claim I'm as attractive as a Hollywood actor, but I feel a solid bit above average, too, and I've got a close female friend that's called me charming, respectful, and brilliant. Meanwhile, in online dating, I find it very hard to convey those attributes, at least in the very initial stages - but I digress.

I'm also not incapable of blaming myself and taking on personal responsibility. But I think we need to admit that sometimes, when you don't get the results you're hoping for, it's not always your fault.",Bifocals_of_Argus,355,507,1.0,0.17995390777079184,1711559282,/r/changemyview/comments/1bp73vl/cmv_online_dating_is_dead/,2024,3

1bdf7cv,"CMV: Pushing for Platonic relationships is not an adequate solution to the ""male loneliness epidemic"" ","Young men are lonely and struggling to find relationships. And one of the major solutions I see being talked about is that men need to focus more on platonic friendships and hobbies. 

Now. I'm pansexual, but happily in a relationship with a beautiful woman who I love and treasure. And for the sake of my argument here I'm going to list the things I've gained and the needs I've had met being in a relationship that Ive never had through platonic relationships. 

And I'll be up front. One of the major things I feel will be needed to change my mind is an outline on how the average man can have those same needs mostly met through platonic friends without needing to find new ones in more ""progressive"" populations that are less homophobic and averse to male on male intimacy among other things. 

So to start. 

We split rent for a one bedroom space. This means we can go out more often and afford a better quality of life. My friends have never wanted to share a room.

We share chores and housework. When she's working I make the meals. When im working she does. We both do the dishes. But I do stuff like laundry and cleaning the toilet because she doesn't like those things. So she takes care of the chores I don't like. My friends don't live with me. They live with their partners. 

We can lean on one another financially. She works freelance, no clients equals no pay. She still pays her bills but I can make sure we both have good groceries for the week because I know she'll get the next batch.  And vice versa. My friends may offer a meal or a couch to stay on. But I can't rely on them. 

We can lean on one another emotionally. If she's having a bad day or her anxiety flares up I can be there to hold her and calm her down. And when I'm feeling hurt or upset or lonely. She's there to hold and cuddle me. My friends only really cuddle or hold their partners and family. 

We help each other with our body image/self esteem.   She compliments me when she sees me naked. She makes me feel like I'm attractive and desirable and I do the same. My friends don't want to see me without clothes. 

We help one another with our self esteem and aesthetic choices. We can go clothes shopping together and point out things that one another would look good in. And I can ask her if I look like shit and get an honest answer. My male friends don't see clothes shopping as social and my female friends don't like a guy tagging along. 

There's plenty more I could think of if I gave this some time and effort but the overarching point is that there are numerous benefits to being in a romantic relationship that simply aren't reasonable to ask for from platonic friends

Men making more friends won't change the fact that society still largely expects people to ""pair up""

I think this is too hopeful of a statement, like saying we will have world peace in ten years. 

Woman are so dangerously hyper sexualised and always have been, and so going into it for “empowerment” doesn't feel sincere to me. Financial freedom is definitely empowering but not the how it's been achieved. Our self worth is tied to many things, one of them being how we spend are time and earn a living. Of course this isn't the case for everyone but it is for many. 

Because with sex work, while the money side may be empowering, the act itself is not. Not if you are happy with people valuing your worth based off your genitals and animal nature. Something we all possess and didn't need to work for. 

  
I am sure there are people reading this ready to write in the comments how judgemental I am, and perhaps thats true. I really don't mean to come across that way. I do respect peoples decision to go into the sex industry and not telling anyone not to do it. I am just wondering if there's anyone who can truly say that having sex with strangers and in front of a camera crew is something respectful, or if its societies pressure to be ""woke"" that makes people feel inclined to hold something that women have always been shamed for by so many men as respectful out of sympathy. 

What I am saying isn’t so much my truth, but the truth of most peoples. Since humanity has existed, sexism towards women has existed on a much greater scale than sexism towards men. There are many ways to claim power without going into something that you wouldn't want your own children to do if you spent 18 years providing them with everything you can for a good life.

I have had many debates with conservatives and simply put I do not believe that they care at all about facts and specifically evidence. Let me explain. I will be debating with a conservative and they will say something completely outrageous or just factually wrong. I will ask for evidence or proof of their claim and one of two things will happen. Either A. They will call me an idiot and tell me that I'm not worth the effort. (Cop-out) or B. They will just say that what they said is true because ""everyone knows it's true"" or some version of that statement. 

I like to bring facts and data into a debate because it seems that the person with more evidence on their side is the correct one, yet whenever I bring up these facts conservatives will brush them aside and just tell me that I'm wrong, despite the evidence.

Recently I was talking about the fact that migrants commit less crimes than citizens and despite all the facts and data all that was brushed aside for feelings.

This leads me to believe that conservatives:

1. Hold a lot of beliefs without facts to back them up.
2. Do not care about facts when presented with them.
