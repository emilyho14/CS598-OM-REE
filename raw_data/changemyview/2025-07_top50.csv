1mblqmi,"CMV: If you're a centrist, and a leftist being mean to you pushes you to the right, you were always a right winger.","I've been seeing that meme way too much lately with the enlightened centrist standing between the red and blue, and being shoved into the red for some asinine take. This might be unpopular but I don't think the people who spread that meme around were ever centrists to begin with. 

See I'm not ignorant to how mean and judgy leftists can be. Infighting is extremely common for a reason. We all have a lot of conviction in our beliefs and some of us tend to interpret different viewpoints as opposing viewpoints. But that's not what I'm talking about here. Because I've had many shitty arguments with self proclaimed leftists and never once has it encouraged me to take on conservative beliefs. 

I genuinely can't imagine the kind of person who has such little moral fiber that they'd reactively change their beliefs at the first instance of pushback. Hell even after many instances of pushback. Leftists love to debate, so you'd also get many reasonable and compelling arguments from them, even if it's 90% vitriol. It'd be one thing if they just doubled down, but these people are saying they changed their beliefs in opposition to the people they were arguing with. It's hard to believe a legitimately open minded person would only absorb from this experience that 'leftist bad.'

And then you take into account the flaming vile words and actions taken by the right. How did hearing 'jews will not replace us.' on national TV not push you to the left then? Did you really never get into a heated argument with a conservative? I've been called slurs a vast number of times, both online and irl, just for arguing with conservatives. And while that specifically isn't a universal experience, the level of vitriol coming from them too great to deny. 

I think most everyone, if not everyone who claims they were a centrist till some leftists pushed them to the right, were actually right wingers the entire time, larping as an enlightened centrist until their right wing beliefs got called out and they doubled down.

1lzuea4,CMV: Muslims shouldn’t expect LGBTQ people to spread awareness about Muslim genocides when most Muslims don’t spread awareness about the LGBTQ genocide in the Middle East.,"As a gay man, I feel there is a double standard where LGBTQ people are expected to take the high road and advocate for Muslim issues but it’s perfectly acceptable for Muslims to be silent on LGBTQ issues. 

I’ve clashed with a few pro-Palestine people for telling them I don’t advocate for the Palestinian people because they don’t advocate for my people. 

The response is always “but people are getting killed!!” but you know what? GAY people are ALSO getting killed all throughout the Middle East. How often do you hear Muslims spread awareness about that? I never do. Why do we have to swallow our pride and support them just because people are dying, when they rarely do that for us?

1m18iia,CMV: Reddit does a fairly good job of pushing men toward the political right,"I’ve noticed over the years that Reddit, despite leaning heavily liberal/progressive in most of its mainstream subreddits, often ends up pushing young men, especially those who feel isolated or frustrated, further toward the political right. I don’t mean Reddit is intentionally doing this, but the way certain ideas dominate discussion while others are aggressively shut down creates a pipeline effect.

Here’s why I believe this happens:

1. **Blatant misandry is tolerated, even celebrated.** There are threads and comments (often upvoted) that generalize men as toxic, dangerous, lazy, incompetent, or inherently privileged. If someone dares to push back, even with nuance, they often get downvoted or banned. This can create resentment, especially in young men who already feel invisible or villainized.
2. **Censorship of alternative views.** While Reddit prides itself on open discourse, many subs (r/politics, r/TwoXChromosomes, r/AskWomen, etc.) have strict moderation policies that lean left. Posts offering centrist or mildly conservative takes often get removed or massively downvoted, which only fuels the sense that right-leaning voices are being silenced rather than debated.
3. **Echo chambers amplify bitterness.** When men express frustration with societal or gender dynamics, they’re told to “cope,” “be better,” or “shut up.” They are called incels and misogynists. So instead of being heard, they’re mocked. Hence they leave or retreat to smaller communities and even some anti-feminist or redpill-adjacent spaces where they feel validated. These can sometimes push them further right over time.
4. **“Progressivism” is increasingly associated with double standards.** Many men see Reddit pushing for empathy, compassion, and equality, but only selectively. For example, if a woman slaps a man in a viral video, the top comment is often laughter or justification. Flip the genders, and it’s outrage. These inconsistencies make “progressive” ideals seem hollow or hypocritical.

To be clear, I don’t believe Reddit is evil or entirely responsible for people’s ideological shifts. But I do believe it contributes more than it realizes to the alienation of young men and ironically ends up pushing them toward the very side it mocks.

1m7dy75,"CMV: Even if there’s definitive proof Trump is a pedophile via Epstein files, it won’t change MAGA or GOP support for him.","Here’s my reasoning: Republicans didn’t change course after countless mass shootings, even when kids were killed in classrooms. They’ve shown that no level of tragedy or moral outrage will make them abandon their positions if it threatens their political power.

So, I don’t see why concrete proof of Trump being a pedophile would make a difference. His base is fiercely loyal, and GOP leadership has a track record of closing ranks instead of holding him accountable.

My view is that, at most, a few moderates might peel off, but overall, his support would remain largely intact, and the Republican Party wouldn’t dump him. The culture war narrative would just spin it as a “deep state setup” or an attack by the left, like everything else.

1meh8rd,"CMV: “My Body, My Choice” Is a Terrible Argument for Pro-Choice When Addressing Pro-Life Audiences","CMV: I think “my body, my choice” is one of the worst arguments a pro-choice person can use when speaking to someone who is pro-life. I’m not saying it is morally wrong to believe in bodily autonomy, or that abortion should or shouldn’t be legal. I’m saying that if the goal is to engage with people who hold pro-life beliefs and actually change their minds, this slogan completely misses the point of where they are coming from.

Here’s why. Many people who are pro-life sincerely believe that abortion is equivalent to taking a human life. In their eyes, the fetus is not just part of your body, it is a separate, developing human being with its own moral status and right to life. You can disagree with that view, but you cannot ignore it if you want to actually persuade them. When you say “my body, my choice,” what they hear is something like “I have the right to end another human life because it’s inconvenient for me.” That’s not a strawman, that’s genuinely how many of them interpret the argument.

Imagine if someone said “my house, my rules” as a justification for killing a 14-year-old who lived with them. That would be horrifying, right? To many pro-life people, the fetus is no different than a child. They see it as vulnerable, innocent, and in need of protection. Saying “my body, my choice” to them sounds no better than “my life, my choice” in defense of harming someone else who is dependent on you.

This doesn’t mean the pro-choice position is invalid. But if the objective is persuasion or productive discussion, this argument fails hard. It refuses to engage with the actual moral premise of the pro-life position. And because of that, it comes across as dismissive, selfish, and disconnected from the core issue. Instead of fostering dialogue, it creates a wall.

So CMV: If your goal is to actually reach pro-life people and not just preach to those who already agree with you, “my body, my choice” is not just ineffective, it’s counterproductive. You cannot change someone’s mind if you refuse to address the thing they care about most.

1ma77mb,CMV: Hamas stealing aid is NOT a valid excuse for a blockage,"Hi, the #1 reason being thrown around for Israel's inhumane aid blockage is that Hamas steals the aid and sells it at very high prices. I don't think that's true, but let's assume it is.

If they are, so what? Israel is clearly dominating this ""war"" and destroying Hamas on all fronts, Hamas pretty much stands no chance and is fighting for survival now. Israel is much more funded and powerful than Hamas could ever be. How could this money they generate from selling food even fund them further? They can't get more weapons into Gaza, what's wrong with ""giving Hamas money"" if Israel plans on killing every Hamas member anyways?

I don't see how Hamas getting more money could skew this ""war"" towards them in any way possible - it's just a bullshit excuse Israel is using to starve Palestinians.

1lyiqhx,CMV: Everything contrapoints said was true and the left needs to stop eating itself.,"Unless you've been living under a rock, the current political discourse surounding contrapoints at the moment and people calling her a Nazi/genocidal apologist is legitimately insane. 

She is right and her views are based in reality. 

Israel is a nuclear armed state with the backing of the US. It is not going anywhere. There will never be a Palestinian utopia. The absolute best case scenario is a 2 state solution. And by definition, if you support a 2 state solution you are a Zionist. We do not need to support Israel, but we have to recognise the fact that it’s not going anywhere and we have to deal with that. Any possible solution will involve the existence of Israel as a state.

What she was referring to as a ""doomed cause"" - is the left's obsession with the complete dissolution of Israel as a state (and the subsequent displacement of millions of Jews). This is never going to happen. We need to put our energy into solutions that are actually feasible. 

Also pointing out that there has been a steep increase in antisemitism real wide does not make you a Zionist. You can be both critical of the mass genocide and displacement of Palestinian people - while also recognising that a raise in antisemitism and the calling for the mass displacement of Jews is a very slippery slope (sound familiar?). Not to mention that a world wide increase in antisemitism fuels Israel's absolutetism regarding Israel as the only real ""safe haven"" for all Jews and that must be protected and armed at all costs. It is counterproductive to the Palestinian course. 

Isn't the point of being left leaning calling out injustices everywhere? And believe it or not, Jews outside of Israel experiencing antisemitism is still an injustice.

1lp31yc,CMV: Justification for misandry is justification for racism,"Getting right into it, justification for misandry is justification for racism. The obvious retort is “it’s different” when really it’s not, except for the fact that you find one acceptable. The same language used for misandry is the same language used in racism.

**Misandry**

“I’d choose a bear over a man. Men commit the majority of violence and rapes against women so women are justified in being cautious of men. It’s not all men but you never know which man it may be. If there was one poisoned skittle in a bag would you still risk eating them?”

**Racism**

I have never heard a justification for misandry that can’t also be applied to racism and the arguments usually just amount to back tracking and rhetoric. The common argument is that one is worse than the other which I don’t think actually matters.

1mcat6d,CMV: The USA is in an Inescapable Death Spiral,"We are in a political death spiral in the USA, there is no mechanism that can stop it.

Back in the day, the parties were looser ideologically. Politics were divided along regional as well as party lines. The consequences of this weren't always great (the Solid South enabling Jim Crow) but they did enable compromise. That's no longer the case, as the parties are now wholly constituted based on their ideologies.

The results of this has been legislative deadlock. Congress can barely pass anything. Once rare measure like the filibuster are now employed routinely. Look at the recent BBB- it had to be passed via budget reconciliation to get around the filibuster. There is no longer any political cost to dirty tricks (think Merrick Garland), and no advantage in compromise.

And so we come to the death spiral. With the legislature useless, both parties have been ceding more and more power to the executive. The stakes for who controls the presidency are now existential. With the precedent of the criminal prosecutions of Donald Trump and this new talk of the DOJ prosecuting Obama, there's a sense that, if a president loses control, they could now face jail or worse. This ""lawfare"" disincentivizes the incumbent from peacefully giving up power. I can't think of a better way to speedrun the death spiral.

So... yeah. Somebody please tell me I'm wrong, that there is some off-ramp to all this, because I don't see one.",Detson101,1797,1388,0.699999988079071,0.35455999192817955,1753794058,/r/changemyview/comments/1mcat6d/cmv_the_usa_is_in_an_inescapable_death_spiral/,2025,7

1lz40a3,"CMV: Conservative outrage blasting the Superman movie for being ""woke"" due to its pro-immigrant message proves that the anti-woke movement is pure ignorance","The first issue of Superman originally came out in 1938, and was widely credited for single-handedly creating the entire comic-book genre. 

One of the biggest themes when Superman first came out was portraying immigrants as people who could become the symbol of what is means to ne American. Especially due to what was going on in 1938. 

Fast forward to today, and the new Superman movie is being blasted by conservative figureheads for being ""woke"" due to its pro-immigrant message. 

Not even going to touch that Superman has been used as a figure to condemn racism and xenophobia, which is partially what it means to be woke.  Heck within the first 10 years of its existence, Superman was depicted taking on the KKK.

Being pro-immigrant and anti-racist in the 1930's and 40's is super duper mega woke in that era. 

Even going further, in the 1950's, Superman was used in conjunction with black activists to target racism and segregation, with even official government posters as well (partly why Superman and Batman have a No-Kill policies). 

The fact that conservatives are calling the new Superman movie ""woke"", proves that the anti-woke movement is completely based on ignorance at the least, and bigotry and the worst. Especially since they didn't know that Superman ALWAYS had a ""woke"" message.

1m6y4el,"CMV: The modern conservative movement in the US can be accurately, not hyperbolically, described as fascist","When I describe the modern conservative movement, a lot of it will have to do with Trump and his movement, MAGA, which maintains widespread support among conservatives and controls much of the country right now, so saying ""I'm a conservative and I disagree with these things"" won't really change my view. 

Trump and MAGA are a near perfect example of a modern fascist movement. Trump rose to power on a wave of populism, attacking the elites who he viewed as effeminate and targeting masculinity and traditional values. Immigrants are scapegoated, viewed as a tool of these elites, brought to the country as part of their efforts to destroy the US. 

Conservatives have embraced autocracy and believe that the only way to defeat these elites is by empowering Trump as a sort of benevolent dictator, who will do whatever it takes, including violating laws and the constitution and human rights, to bring us back to a mythologized past where ""the real Americans"", Trump's supporters, MAGA, maintain a sort of special status. There's a strong and well documented cult of personality surrounding Trump, where conservatives will completely change their claimed ideals and beliefs depending on what Trump is doing at the time. 

Trump is against the constitution, frequently violating the constitution to target freedom of speech, imprisoning immigrants for writing op eds he doesn't like, using executive orders to try to change the constitution through executive overreach, deporting US citizens. He's effectively turning the country into a police state where anyone can be stopped, detained, and imprisoned at any time for any reason without warrant or cause. In response to protests in LA, he took control of the state national guard and deployed the military on US soil, against states rights, against the wishes of the state and city, and his administration has said that the military will stay until they oust the democratically elected state and city governments. 

Trump has become obsessed with expansionism and protectionism, is strongly illiberal, opposed to democracy, tried to overturn one election, pardoned convicted seditionists that violently tried to help him seize power, and has created an uneasy alliance between extremist militia groups and other extremists, Christian fundamentalists, and traditional elites. He tries to exert strong personal control over basically every aspect of the country and the economy, personally threatening corporate elites unless they demonstrate loyalty (Zuckerberg, Musk, etc.), threatening political opposition with imprisonment, stripped citizenship, and deportation, targeting and threatening journalists for writing about his administration, targeting lawyers who defend clients against his administration, and on and on. 

What I've described here is an ideology that's called fascism. I'm saying that Trump is a fascist, and his supporters are falling for fascism. I'm not exaggerating or using it as simply an insult, I understand what fascism is. Fascism doesn't mean ""killed 11 million people,"" such a definition would suggest that Franco and Mussolini and even Hitler, prior to the final solution, were not fascists. It does not mean ""literally Hitler"". Pointing out that though Trump is dismantling due process in the US and sending people to foreign concentration camps where they'll be tortured, but hey, at least they're not gas chambers, isn't a refutation. 

I'm talking about generally understood historical facts of fascism, the common elements of fascism, which Trump and his movement share. This isn't partisan hyperbole, people from all over the political spectrum acknowledge that Trump is a fascist. Conservatives who oppose Trump acknowledge he's a fascist. Well respected generals who worked with Trump directly have said that he's a fascist. Historians who quite literally wrote the book on fascism are calling Trump a fascist. The fascists know Trump is a fascist and support him, and the anti fascists know Trump is a fascist and oppose him. 

But for some reason, there's this weird group in the middle that demands that we walk on eggshells, that we should *never* use the word fascist, even to accurately describe a fascist movement. If you just don't like the word fascist for whatever reason, fine, we can call it a far right extremist ideology that's strongly illiberal, opposed to the concept of human rights and limited government, authoritarian in nature, and oppressive, and all the other shared pieces. That's fine. But it doesn't change the fact that we're talking about, that this movement is fascist, that this is what people post WW2 spent decades trying to understand and prevent from happening again, because it is intensely harmful. 

I think that a lot of people who have trouble accepting this first, don't actually know what fascism is, and think that fascism means ""killed 11 million people,"" or ""literally Hitler"", or it's just an insult. Secondly, many know that fascism is *bad*, this is deeply ingrained in them, but... They like what fascism *is*, they like what Trump is doing, so, they can't acknowledge that they're supporting or defending fascism. 

For some other views you can dive into as a bit of a side component, Trump and the modern conservative movement are opposed to the fundamental values that the country was formed to protect. Trump has gotten people so riled up and scared about immigrants through dehumanization and demonization, that his supporters are willing to dismantle our basic human rights as long as we keep harming them. Not just undocumented immigrants either, Trump is targeting immigrants who legally came to the country, who broke no laws. He's targeting children born in the US, who are US citizens, and wants to deport them to countries they've never been to. He's sending people to brutal, inhumane concentration camps in El Salvador and Sudan without due process and completely needlessly, and many of these people were legally in the US when imprisoned. Most have never been convicted of a crime. 

All of this is very, very bad. Human rights are important. People have forgotten these things. They've forgotten things we swore we wouldn't forget. Like, for example, that a fascist may be going after a group that does not include you now, but that will expand, and you yourself may find yourself sent to the concentration camps. Your rights will be violated. Even the early supporters of fascism found themselves purged, murdered, exiled, etc. 

Whether or not you're willing to call this fascism I consider rather unimportant. What Trump is doing is harmful. We know it's harmful. We've seen it play out over and over again. The benevolent dictator is something of a myth. He might be hurting the people you want him to hurt now, but fascists are always making enemies. 

Some other points: telling me I've been ""watching too much MSNBC"" isn't going to change my view. I don't watch MSNBC, and attacking every journalist or news source that says something negative, but true, isn't a good refutation of anything. 

The statements of fact I've made, like that Trump is targeting legal immigrants and refugees and political opposition and journalists and lawyers and that he tried to overturn an election and pardoned convicted seditionists, these are facts. They happened, regardless of what news sources you watch.

1mdyofz,CMV: The killing of Corporate Executives (or other wealthy elites) is a facet of class warfare equivalent or lesser than cutting critical services.,"**This is not a post advocating for violence.**

Recently Wesley LePatner, an executive for Blackstone who oversaw a $53 billion dollar real-estate investment fund, was killed by an armed shooter. This attack was less clearly motivated than the killing of healthcare executive Brian Thomson. However it does mark the 2nd high profile executive that was killed in recent memory. 

Currently in the United States, the bottom 50% of households hold less than 4% of the national wealth. A significant portion of which is held by the top of that 50%, because many people towards the bottom of that range have less than nothing, just debt. Many of these people rely on social services like Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, just to survive. 

It's not an exaggeration to say that many of these people's lives are held at the mercy of wealthy individuals' whims. So when someone like Brian Thompson makes a policy choice that he knows will lead to thousands of people to be denied potential life saving medical care, or a real-estate mogul raises rent for the 5th consecutive time knowing families will be homeless, they are aware that their actions will kill people. 

I don't see how the targeted killing of individuals with this kind of power is fundamentally different than someone knowingly taking their lives. The only true difference is that the wealthy elite uses a policy change instead of a gun, and is protected by a few layers of separation. In the end though, both parties are making choices with the full knowledge that it will kill or ruin someone's life.

I'd even argue that many policy chocies made by the elite are worse comparatively, due to the scope of harm caused. Things like cuts to USAID or the NIH will touch the lives of exponentially more people than any individual murder.

1) The arts and other [manifestations](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=a324f93b4d046afe&sxsrf=AE3TifMZY8KvLL6hQaHjLBjbg7SmIj60pw:1753295614931&q=manifestations&si=AMgyJEs12bGtDCy4_xP40vvZvb7lRsUhQXxpTeY8t74Kgq2SuoNcjS3_pYvkbhfzNiLsTd0m48jnvgr5URaTkb4qgf1eBDXli6TXkDlz3XchhX6Eof2tLUI%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjpxMGSz9OOAxW6tokEHdkkJ2YQyecJegQIPhAR) of human intellectual achievement regarded [collectively](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=a324f93b4d046afe&sxsrf=AE3TifMZY8KvLL6hQaHjLBjbg7SmIj60pw:1753295614931&q=collectively&si=AMgyJEteZp7BQEz0BAvgfpJJ2JtV2mcy4zap4N6wn51kTdIyy_pIhShSUL-MZ7LrScp_JKxw4eoeoV9I1c4DXAh04laJDYgfi8Tfaxw5_8_wViyBhuJSaO8%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjpxMGSz9OOAxW6tokEHdkkJ2YQyecJegQIPhAS).

2) The customs, arts, social institutions, and achievements of a particular nation, people, or other social group.

Here's a few examples of cultural American forces that have dominated Europe over the past half century:

1) Movies. not just the industry based in hollywood, but Thomas Edison made commercial film a possibility within the US, later to be replicated by cultures around the world.

2) Nearly all popular music genres within the past 50+ years. Jazz, Rock, Rap, Pop, even Reggaeton since Puerto Rico is part of the US. All of these genres were created by Americans and later replicated by other cultures around the world.

3) Blue jeans. One of the most common articles of clothing across the world, extremely versatile piece of clothing.

4) Government institutions. Our founding constitution created a foundation for many other modern democracies around the world to model their laws around.

1lv1y5o,CMV: There is no realistically implementable solution to stop the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from ending in tragedy.,"I don't believe any amount of sanctions, peace efforts, global outrage, and international pressure can stop the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and this conflict will keep on going until one side eventually extinguishes the other through either ethnic cleansing or genocide.

Both sides have deeply rooted religious and nationalist extremists in their respective societies that will never accept co-existence with the other. Both sides lay claim to the same land, with their own set of evidences / reasonings as to who came first.

 The ""moderates"" among Israelis and Palestinians have no real political will, power or ability to prevent the extremists from doing nasty stuff to the other side, and that will keep festering this conflict until one side eventually resorts to the forceful removal of the other through ethnic-cleansing or genocide.

I wish to emphasize this post does not advocate for such outcomes. Its merely my view that I don't see any realistic path forward so long as extremism is rooted so deeply among so many in both sides of this conflict, and I don't believe there is any way to forcefully re-educate those radical elements for any realistic one state or two state solution to be achieved.",Warm_Anxiety_7379,537,1812,0.7200000286102295,0.3153694265722451,1752012675,/r/changemyview/comments/1lv1y5o/cmv_there_is_no_realistically_implementable/,2025,7

How did so many women, LGBTQ+, fiscal conservatives, Christians fail to show-up and vote against Trump? \[about half of the 36% who did not vote\]

How did people who support LGBTQ+, support ""christian"" values (love your neighbor, care for the poor, treat the immigrant like your brother, share with those in need, spread love not hate) abstain from the vote rather than show up in maximum numbers to support not-Trump?

1mbtt5j,CMV: People Are Overreacting To Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle Ad,"For those who don't know, Sydney Sweeney is facing allegations of Nazism for her American eagle ad, in which she says ""my genes/jeans are blue."" which is a play on the phrase blue jeans and on the fact that she has blue eyes and blonde hair, people are taking this as glorification of the Aryan race and propaganda towards Nazism.

Media literacy has drastically declined over the years. There is nothing in this ad that promotes Nazism or glorifies the Aryan race. People are constantly overanalyzing everything, just looking for something to be upset about.

Meanwhile, we have people dying in ICE custody, being ripped away from their homes, and this is what we choose to be angry over?

Let's focus on real issues and stop getting distracted by internet misdirections. We need to stop mistaking outrage bait for activism.

I feel like people are overreacting because the advertisement doesn't show any hidden agenda, the ad is very straightforward as a promotion for American Eagle jeans, which is a *Jewish* owned brand. why would a Jewish owned brand be actively advocating and supporting Nazism?

1m5ukdm,"CMV: Christians, based on their own teachings, should lean left politically.","This is based on a few verses.

First of which (and the strongest pointer, in my opinion) would be the Parable of Sheep and Goats. Jesus is essentially saying that the treatment of the lowest in society should be of the same quality as the treatment we would give to Jesus himself, and we would be rewarded with eternal glory. Neglect of the lowest in society is the same as neglecting Jesus, and, thus, you should burn in eternal damnation. 

Then there's Proverbs 30:8-9. ""Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me, lest I be full and deny you and say, “Who is the Lord?” or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God."" It seems like they are saying that we should only take what we need, and we should provide for those who have need. It, certainly, seems to show a distaste for those who live in luxury while others suffer.

1 Corinthians 10:24, ""Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor"" This seems to be stating that we should provide for others and others will provide for us. 

Deuteronomy 14:28-29, ""At the end of every three years you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in the same year and lay it up within your towns. And the Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance with you, and the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your towns, shall come and eat and be filled, that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands that you do."" AKA you should feed those who you owe nothing to and you will rewarded. 

1 Corinthians 12:26 ""If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together."" We exist as a collective, and should only suffer if it is together, and work together towards a common good. 

James 5:1-20 ""Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days. Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, are crying out against you, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter"" 

I think you get the point. The Bible oftentimes points to this idea of working towards a greater good regardless of personal reward or suffering. I feel like this is very in line with my personal ideals (to be brief, Libertarian Socialist) of providing welfare to those in need and providing tools for the people who are down on their luck to pull themselves up with. Additionally, I believe that these verses strongly frown on those that see somebody suffering and kind of shrug and say, ""not my problem,"" as many right-wing people would say about welfare issues, as well as frowning on people who hoard wealth in general.

I guess, to change my views you would need to show that A) the left does not actually align itself to the passages stated (and there are more that I left unstated) B) that the ideals above are not actually contradicted by right-wing policies C) that I am misinterpreting the verses above, and the more reasonable interpretation aligns more with right-wing policies or D) IDK, if I knew all the ways I could change my opinion, I wouldn't be here.

1m5xlfs,CMV: Most complaints from older women about feeling “invisible” to society are simply beautiful women experiencing the natural process of aging.,"I remember watching the first season of the Golden Bachelor with my gf at the time and listening to the different female contestants on the show talking about their experiences as women “past their pretty years” and how they feel society ignores them. But not just them, I work in a  career field with a lot of women and I’ve overheard scattered bits and pieces from others women discussing similar problems. 

If you’ll allow me to paraphrase a somewhat famous aphorism that goes “To those with privilege, equality often feels like injustice”, I feel like that’s very applicable here. Older women, like women in general, deal with a lot of poor treatment from men who don’t respect or understand the aging process. And historically men’s investment in women they’re not related to decreases in proportion to their age and attractiveness. 

But the experience of being unseen isn’t  unique among older women nor would I argue is it even the objectively worst part of dating. To put it crudely, these women had the luxury of being one of the prettiest people in the room from their childhood to at least their mid 40’s. Now, they’re starting to get treated like the rest of us average folk, men and women alike. 

That’s not unfairness that’s just a leveling of the fields. Compare that with the experience of average men/women as they age. They start out not getting noticed and then as they age, they get truly invisible. It’s even worse for the ugly ones. Men don’t care and women still have the threat of sexual assault hanging over their heads for the rest of their lives so they’re even less likely to see or try and see those men either.

Strange, ugly men weeping or looking sad in the streets attract less sympathy on the whole then any lady. It’s why it’s far more common for homeless women to receive help and *not* be seen on the streets as opposed to homeless men. 

As a final point, I’d just say that the women who feel invisible aren’t invisible in the ways average people are. They’re invisible relative to a beautiful girl half their age in the same room, but relative to their generation and age group, they’re still beautiful and have access to a form of pretty privilege that average or ugly seniors can/will never have.

1m46t1p,"CMV: The only right to a piece of land is by the sword. The whole ""who came first"" debate is just indoctrination for the masses","I come from the Balkans. The hobby of our ultra-nationalists here is to try and justify who came first to the region. 

While we generally know this, the reality is that ethnic groups were formed after the arrival of these groups in the region. All ethnic groups here, while in fact having a sort of genetic continuity, are in no way direct descendants of one single ethnic group, whose culture hasn't been the same since time immemorial. We are all mixed to some extent, and the labels of ""Serb"" ""Albanian"" or whatever other group have existed for centuries, while actually having different connotations. 

I do acknowledge that colonialism and atrocities took place, this is obvious. I don't believe we should forget them, we should talk about them so that we might never repeat them (in theory...). 

In this sense, I do believe that the ""post-colonial"" thinking of ""taking back"" whatever land was taken from you is not morally good or morally bad, it just defends certain interests. These debates often just digress forever and fuel the violence machine. At the end, as history shows, whoever has the biggest and best guns wins, the rest is just wrapping. 

I am generally pro-Palestinian because I believe that you should not indeed flatten a whole region indiscriminately in the hope that it will solve anything.

But I have to admit that I have been watching with a sort of amusement the whole ""Israelis are colonisers, Palestinians are indigenous people"" debate. 

While Zionism is a pure nationalist idea (unless you believe in Jewish Bronze Age fairytales, in that case, ok God promised them the land), there is no denial that all Jewish groups have some sort of genetic connection to the Levant. 

While ""Palestinian"" is a new-ish ethnic label, the local Arab Palestinians are no invaders but Arabised remnants of the local populations. 

Now, in my honest opinion, if Palestinians had the guns and international support the Israelis had, they would not hesitate for a single second to do the same thing to them. Israelis are not inherently evil and Palestinians pure or vice versa, it's just that the balance of power and PR is in their favour and has been for a while. There is no ""inherently evil European colonialist"". 

Who are the Palestinians to blame for their demise? The current Israeli government? Sure, many of them are brainwashed to the core. But who should they blame first? Their own forefathers that sold the land? The Ottoman government that allowed the Zionists to settle? Their own leadership which is corrupt? 

If the Palestinians want ""their"" land back, they have to get it by the sword. Easy in theory. The whole ""from the river to the sea"" thing is just propaganda to rally the masses. But the underlying legitimacy is only gained by force. 

To counter this, it is obviously pure nonsense ny Zionists to say that God gave them the land and expect the Palestinians to give them sweets on arrival. Even if the Jews have a genetic link to the land, that gives them 0 right to get it back, unless they get it by force (which they did). In that case, it has nothing to do with the whole promised land shtick.

To end, it amuses me to see Western leftists defend to the bone the ""indigenous right"" of some  ""indigenous"" people to a piece of land. In this case they're only described as ""indigenous"" because they were ""one with nature"" or had no leader, or because they were there just before the Europeans came. Why doesn't anyone tell the Navajos to go back to Canada? Or the Nahuatl to stop the Inca Empire? 

It is like when the Samis are often described as the ""only indigenous people of Europe"". Are they indigenous just because they lived in huts and look remotely Mongolian? Even though they probably settled there after the Germanic people? 

Why aren't the Polish indigenous? Or the Albanians? Should we give back the whole of Iberia to the Basque? 

These types of thought processes are rightfully rejected as bullshit and childlish whenever we see them from the Balkans. We reject them as memes, as a rightful object of mockery. How can these Albanians pretend they're Illyrian, they're all mixed lol, primitive Balkaners.

If a remotely brown people group lays claim to a piece of land, not only they are immediately accepted, the type of blood and soil jingoism rejected in the Balkans is made into dogma, inscribed in a ""post-colonial"" school of thought in reputed Western academia.

1lvhpet,cmv: The Supreme Court allowing Trump to Challenge the Constitution is the most Dangerous thing Happening Right Now.,"So I am a never Trump Republican. One of my core values is that the constitution, while imperfect, has to stand to the letter. This doesn't mean you can't ratify it, it was meant to be, but if the legislature won't amend it then it needs to be followed to the letter of the law. 

Lately, the Supreme Court has issued a couple rulings that I think are absolutely insane in reference to the Trump admin and their challenging of the constitutional protections granted to people in the United States. 1) The ruling to pause all injunctions on Trump deporting people to foreign countries without allowing them to contest, 2) The pause on the injunction against birthright citizenship. 

Both of those appear to be pretty obviously ingrained in the constitution the same way our right to bear arms is, and yet the supreme court casually allowed this administration to push them while delaying an ACTUAL ruling on the subject matter. This is a tactic that seems specifically aimed to allow the court to delay, or even worse set the groundwork to allow the president to violate clear wording in the constitution. 

In my recollection, we've always had the supreme court stand pretty close to the most literal reading of the constitution and for the first time ever it appears they are about to rule against clear wording. The premise that the president may be able to act in defiance of a literalist constitution without a judicial check is probably the most concerning development in my lifetime, and I'd like someone to either A) convince me that the fourteenth amendment doesn't actually grant birthright citizenship, convince me that the due process statement in the constitution doesn't apply to all people in the US (this specifically doesn't say citizens), or B) convince me that this isn't the Supreme Court taking an anti-constitutional approach to rulings and that the core document of our republic is still being respected by the highest court.

**Note- Semantic edge case which is NOT what I am talking about outlined at the end.**

Well, I should be careful about saying ""anyone"". There are 8 billion people in the world. Maybe someone out there really does think they are the same, but for all practical intents and purposes, nobody really does, that is just a line of baloney they use to justify their opposition to abortion. 

We don't have obituaries for miscarriages.

We don't have funerals for miscarriages.

While of course many miscarriages are very tragic for the expectant parent, there are millions, tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of miscarriages every year that are no big deal, or that the woman doesn't even notice, and in fact many are even celebrated. 

Even in cases where the miscarriage is tragic, the parents and the family and the community doesn't mourn it like they would a lost infant. 

If anyone were in a situation where they had to choose between saving one single actual child versus a cooler with say 500 embryos (assuming a scenario where the embryos could be immediately secured and would survive), all of us, in fact almost every human on this planet, would save the child over the embryos without even the faintest whisper of a second thought.

  
Nobody actually thinks of a fetus/embryo as being equal to a human life. The singular and only context where they say this is in the context of compelling women to bear children, or eliminating their ability to voluntarily abort, that is voluntarily miscarry, something that happens ALL THE TIME naturally. In every other context, the death of the born and the unborn are treated as being quite different. 

**Semantic Edge Case- You might have someone out there who tries to argue ""Well, it IS human life, but it's a lesser category of human life that still counts as human but doesn't get the same considerations as fully born persons. Which is why we don't mourn them the same, and don't prioritize them the same."". And ok, fair enough, but that's not really what I am talking about. A person who believes the unborn are human life but of a lesser status and with fewer legal and moral consideration tied to them, I probably actually agree with that person. That's not really what I'm talking about here. I am talking about those who make the argument that they are human in the context of the abortion debate and that they should get the same legal protections and moral considerations as born humans.**

1mcnslq,CMV: Conservatives strongly overestimate Democrat loyalty to their elected officials,"My reasoning: Ever since the Epstein files came out and Trump had been accused of being on them, the immediate retort from MAGA conservatives is “Clinton was there too+mentions of Obama, Biden, Hilary, etc.”

1. Anyone who was born after 1980ish ( so anyone roughly younger than 50) just doesn’t  care about Clinton mainly because he didn’t impact their lives in ways they can likely recall. Left-leaning people of this generation are more familiar with someone like Obama.

2. While liberals may have the rep of “blue no matter who”, as someone who has been left-leaning their whole life, one of the most frustrating things about the group is how hyper critical they are. In the previous election, my personal theory is Kamala lost due to not being “radical” enough and being constantly criticized by the left base for not being left enough. Everyone’s entitled to their own theories, but I just say this as an example that candidates aren’t just worshipped blindly by left leaning people, and are seen more as a better alternative to their agenda. In other words, they didn’t just accept her(or anyone’s) candidacy without criticism after.

3. On another point, liberals are socially famous for “cancelling” people. Right or wrong, this also applies to politicians too. All it takes is someone saying the wrong thing and it’s “so you support x issue ?” Or “they didn’t post about x so they must hate x community”. In other words, left leaning loyalties are brittle and easily broken. AOC, as a more recent example, is heavily criticized for not voting the way her constituents want.

3. Democrats don’t take it personally when you insult democrat leaders, including Obama. In fact, I’d wager if you asked a sample of Obama voters their opinion on him now, a good chunk of them would say something akin to “I liked him, but he didn’t do enough or yeah he’s just like other politicians.” Meanwhile, any direct criticism of Trump draws out his supporters as if they had been personally attacked. No one is losing sleep over Biden or Clinton going to jail. 

All this to say, if your response to the E.F. Is” Well what about Clinton” , I promise you nobody on this side cares. Bill or Hilary. Obama might get more of a reaction but I promise no one’s gonna try to overthrow the government or stay loyal if any or all of them are implicated.

1m1e1a8,"CMV: We shouldn’t keep excusing harmful practices just because they’re part of a religion, including Islam","I believe that harmful practices shouldn’t be protected or tolerated just because they’re done in the name of religion, and that this especially applies to Islam, where criticism is often avoided out of fear of being labeled Islamophobic. To be clear, I’m not saying all Muslims are bad people. Most Muslims I know are kind, peaceful, and just trying to live decent lives. But I am saying that some ideas and practices that exist in Islamic law, culture, or tradition, such as apostasy laws, women’s dress codes, punishments for blasphemy, or attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people, are deeply incompatible with modern human rights values. In many countries where Islam is the dominant religion, these practices are not fringe. They are law. People are imprisoned or even killed for things like leaving the religion, being gay, or criticizing the Prophet. And yet, in the West, many of us are so concerned with respecting Islam that we won’t criticize these ideas openly, even when they violate the same values we would condemn in other contexts. If a Christian group said women need to cover up or they’ll tempt men into sin, most people I know would call that sexist. But if it’s a Muslim community saying the same thing, suddenly it’s “cultural” or “their tradition.” Why do we have double standards?

I think avoiding this conversation out of fear or political correctness just enables oppression, especially of women, ex-Muslims, and queer people within Muslim communities. I also think it does a disservice to the many Muslims who want reform and are risking their safety to call out these issues from within.

So my view is this: Respecting people is not the same as respecting all their ideas. We can and should critique harmful religious practices, including those found in Islam, without being bigoted or racist.",Mysterious_Role_5554,1709,695,0.8299999833106995,0.24351761252446186,1752676099,/r/changemyview/comments/1m1e1a8/cmv_we_shouldnt_keep_excusing_harmful_practices/,2025,7
1lyo4fr,CMV: Epstein files scare Trump for reason(s) other than the fact Trump himself is in them.,"For anyone apart from the most deluded cult members it is obvious and public knowledge that Trump is in the files, flight logs and had a close relationship with Epstein.  

Anything that is worse than that could be easily destroyed or covered up well enough for the all too willing cult to accept the Fox news spin of it and move on. Teflon Don has managed to get his following to accept so much already he could certainly find some way to spin his relationship with Epstein such that they would contort themselves to believe even the most ridiculous excuse. 

The way Trump, Bondi and other are handling this now is digging themselves into a massive hole and that screams that there is a far bigger risk. 

I DON'T think Trump is primarily worried about his own inclusion.  I think the bigger problem is dozens of other powerful paedophiles he is somehow obliged to protect.  

I think others that are on the list or in the evidence have a lot more risk than Trump does, as he is essentially immune to investigations, lawsuits, divorce and can brush off a lot of public scrutiny and he has the full power of the DOJ to illegitimately defend him or shut down threats. 

Given how many times Trump was on the flights, at the island and cohorting with Epstein over many years he must have also been interacting with other Predators and paedophiles. Those people must know a lot more than what is in the Epstein evidence and if they go down they can spill serious evidence on Trump.   These are likely many very powerful and (ironically) credible people with lots of resources to go scorched earth on Trump if he feeds them to the wolves 

Trump is likely trapped in a position where he knows he has to protect all the other Epstein paedophiles for fear of what a few of them could expose about his own involvement. 

It is also highly likely that Trump has extorted many of these people already and many may have been forced to support his campaign.  At least a few of them would be smart enough to have insurance. 

This also correlates to his statement regarding the files and the risk to 'people'. 

This better explains the otherwise irrational actions of Bondi etc. Than simply protecting Trump himself which could be done in a less destructive way.

1m1r35k,"CMV: The rise of racial affinity groups (like Black-only spaces, AAPI-only clubs, etc.) is creating more division than solidarity.","So this is something that's been on my mind for a while and I’m honestly a little nervous to post this, but I’m here in good faith and genuinely open to changing my mind.

Lately I’ve been seeing more and more spaces that are race-specific like “Black-only healing spaces,” “Latinx-only events,” or “AAPI-only support groups.” And while I totally get the intention behind it (safe spaces, shared experience, etc.), I can’t help but feel like it’s starting to divide people more than bring us together.

I’m not saying these groups shouldn’t exist. I’m more wondering if they are actually helping in the way we hope? Or are they unintentionally making things feel more separate?

I’ve been in situations where I couldn’t join a convo or event because I wasn’t the “right” ethnicity, and it felt... kinda off? Like I respect the goal, but if we’re talking about inclusion and solidarity, shouldn’t there be more cross-race dialogue together , not in separate rooms?

Also what about people who are mixed race? Or people who feel connected to multiple cultures? Where do they fit in?

To be clear: I’m not trying to downplay anyone’s experiences or say “all lives matter” or anything like that. I just genuinely worry that we’re unintentionally building echo chambers, even within progressive spaces.

Anyway, curious what others think. Happy to be proven wrong, change my view.",trustnobody01,1099,874,0.7099999785423279,0.22060707598304918,1752706109,/r/changemyview/comments/1m1r35k/cmv_the_rise_of_racial_affinity_groups_like/,2025,7

What might change my view is evidence that there is some significant harm caused by allowing baby food into Gaza, but it currently seems to me that the prime beneficiaries of such baby formula getting in would be children. The harm of allowing baby food in would have to be pretty significant to cancel out the sizeable benefit of reducing malnourishment of children.

1lul66i,CMV: Donald Trump's presidency is considerably worse for the US then Richard Nixon's ever was,"While both men damaged public trust and democratic norms, Trump’s actions have been more overt, sustained, and systemically dangerous to the integrity of the U.S. & it's institutions. Reasons why Trump is considerably worse for the United States than Nixon ever was:

1. Scale and repetition 

Nixon obstructed justice in the Watergate cover up

Trump has shown a pattern of undermining democratic norms across multiple domains and years, not just one event:
- Pressuring the DOJ to protect allies and target enemies.
- Refusing to release tax returns (breaking modern transparency tradition).
- Firing or retaliating against inspectors general and whistleblowers.
- Using the presidency to enrich his businesses (emoluments concerns).
- Normalizing nepotism and loyalty over competence

Nixon committed a massive coverup and was forced out. Trump’s actions are continuous and ongoing, more public, and go without consequence due to his monopolization of the government and Supreme Court.


 2.January 6th

Nixon lost power due to criminal activity after winning an election.

Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election:
- Spread a disinformation campaign about election fraud
- Tried to pressure state officials to ""find"" votes
- Encouraged fake electors and pressured Pence to block certification
- His rhetoric helped incite the January 6th insurrection, which attempted to stop the peaceful transfer of power

Trump’s actions in 2020–2021 posed a direct threat to American democracy. Nixon abused power to hide wrongdoing. Trump tried to use power to stay in power, even after losing an election.


3. Erosion of truth and spread of disinformation

Nixon lied and covered up crimes, but most Americans believed the media and the system when the truth emerged.

Trump eroded faith in truth itself:
- He branded the press “the enemy of the people”
- Flooded the public with disinformation 
- Popularized the tern “fake news” to dismiss criticism/taint facts
- Promoted conspiracy theories from QAnon to bleach cures for COVID

Trump’s attacks on truth have affected public trust in a more systemic and lasting way than Nixon’s lies ever did.


4. Handling of national crises

Nixon was no hero when it came to Vietnam, but he eventually pulled out and reduced troops.

Trump:
- Downplayed the seriousness of COVID-19, even admitting it privately
- Delayed action, undermined scientists, and spread misinformation
- Mocked masks, discouraged vaccines, and politicized public health

Thousands of avoidable deaths took place because of his + his administration's mismanagement, denial, and politics during a global pandemic.


5. Worsening political polarization and division

Nixon’s presidency created distrust in government

-Trump amplified distrust not just in government, but in democracy, elections, science, education, and journalism
- His rhetoric encouraged political violence.
- He emboldened far right extremism and white nationalism (i.e. ""there were good people on both sides"")
- He fostered us vs them politics with continued attacks on immigrants, Democrats, protestors, & everyone else he disagrees with

6. Impact on public health

To fight poverty, Nixon essentially proposed replacing welfare with a basic income policy for all Americans.

Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"":
- Slashes 186 billion dollars from SNAP and other nutrition programs for low income families 
- Makes significant cuts to Medicaid (12 million+ will lose insurance over the next 10 years) 
- Increases out of pocket costs for seniors on Medicaid


Nixon was a flawed president whose legacy is justifiably stained by scandal. But Trump’s presidency is a more sustained attack on democracy, truth, and accountability, and the damage affects (many) more people. 

These are the reasons why I think Trump is worse; the article I linked provides reasons why Nixon practically looks like a saint in comparison.

1m5sb72,CMV: There has been a major shift toward the alt-right.,"Not just in the United States, (which I’m sure everyone has heard about sense we make our politics everyone’s business) but all over the world… There has been a major shift toward the right, and I think a major reason for this shift, is due to the uncertainty of today. With the rapid development of technology and relatively unease with climate change and social changes, people are scared and uneasy, unable to keep up. 

So, when people are scared, they look for a “strongman” to lead them… maybe for them, being things back in time to when they were more comfortable. this of course leads to a shift towards more far right fascist policies as these “strongmen” they elect play on their fears and direct them towards minority groups or personal things that said leader can use to shift the blame and push certain agendas that benefit said leaders.",Illustrious-Tip8717,444,1131,0.699999988079071,0.205717910994101,1753125814,/r/changemyview/comments/1m5sb72/cmv_there_has_been_a_major_shift_toward_the/,2025,7
1lqveh4,CMV: The Republican Party’s Core Seems to Be Cruelty,"I do genuinely want to change my view because I don’t want to label an entire demographic of people as evil however. 

I’ve been watching the political landscape for a while, and I can’t shake the feeling that the modern Republican Party has leaned hard into policies and rhetoric that prioritize cruelty over compassion. It’s not just about “tough love” or fiscal conservatism anymore, it feels like a deliberate pattern. Here are a few examples that stand out to me:

Healthcare: Pushing to repeal the ACA without a viable replacement, which would strip millions of people of coverage. The focus seems less on improving healthcare and more on dismantling protections for the vulnerable, like those with pre-existing conditions.
  
Immigration: Policies like family separations at the border or slashing refugee admissions feel designed to inflict suffering rather than solve any practical issue. The “zero tolerance” approach doesn’t seem to deter migration as much as it punishes desperate people.

Social Safety Nets: Efforts to cut programs like SNAP or Medicaid often come with rhetoric about “personal responsibility,” but they disproportionately harm the poorest and most marginalized people who are already struggling.

Culture Wars: From attacking trans rights to banning books, the GOP’s culture war battles seem to target already vulnerable groups, amplifying division and fear instead of fostering understanding or unity.

It’s not just policy, look at the rhetoric. The glee some Republican leaders show when “owning the libs” or dismissing marginalized groups’ struggles feels less like principle and more like reveling in others’ pain. Even their economic policies, like tax cuts skewed toward the ultra-wealthy, seem to prioritize the powerful over the struggling.


Am I missing something here? Is there a unifying principle I’m overlooking that ties these policies together in a way that isn’t about cruelty? I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially if you lean Republican and see this differently.

1lqvlqf,CMV: American Midterms will be dangerous for Democratic voters,"I want to start off by saying I'm aware of how hyperbolic this sounds. It's a wild thing to say and something I would have scoffed at in previous elections. I will also recognize that this is speculation at this point, but I would argue that speculation is an informed one based on the trends of history and the statements made by the American government currently. 

But looking at American politics I'm convinced it's not operationally the same country anymore. The weaponization of media and demographics research is bold-faced and alarming. 

This isn't necessarily a comment on whether the midterms will be free and fair elections, though I have my doubts about that as well. This is a strong suspicion I have that, based on the comments and attitudes of the American President and the Republican Party, anyone who votes Democrat during the election will be identified as, in the government's eyes, an enemy. 

The danger may not be in the polling room, it may be what comes after. Already there are calls from prominent government officials to rescind citizenship and confine individuals who disagree with them politically but pose no other threat (see the New York mayoral election as an example). I fully believe these tactics are foreshadowing for an eventual weaponization of voting data and party registrations. 

Please change my mind. I don't want this to be the case.

1m3rj87,CMV: The complete silence current massacre of Druze in Syria proves for the 1000th time that the world doesn't care about what happens in the region unless the Jews can be blamed for it,"TL:DR - Events in the middle east only get the front page attention in the news if they make Israel look bad



Hey guys,

I myself am not from the region, but have been closely following its news for a while, both from pan Arab, Israeli and global sources.

**A few months ago**, Alawite militias still loyal to the old regime ambushed and killed a convoy of the new government, the result was total mobilization to disarm those groups - the result was that the same government forces did not only target militants, but went into civilian homes and executed entire families, wiping full parts of some villages, the estimates range anywhere between a few hundred deaths to a few thousands, but most of them are around 1500

At the time, in most global media outlets, it was either not reported at all, or reported on the bottom of the page

A few weeks after that, the same government tried to do the same with Druze, initially again, no global media outlet reported about it, despite that it has been the main item on most Israeli (and a minority of Arab) outlets, it was only when Israel decided to start bombing the massacring forces that it was the first time it was reported on the main pages, and the first time I saw it being mentioned on social media (as outrage against Israel trying to conquer Syria, don't get your hopes up that anyone cares about the Druze)

  
**This week**

In the past week, something similar happened again, a local dispute resulting from case where a Bedouin robbed a Druze, escalated to a full total war between the 2 sects - **at that point, no reports on global media**

Then, the government forces entered Suwayda, the region where the Druze live, in the guise of trying to create peace, then, unsurprisingly, did the exact same as they did with the Alawites, massacred civilians on mass, in their cities and their homes

I don't know how many were murdered but judging from the videos, it may be worse than what happened a few months back on the coast - **and still barely anyone other than Israeli media reported about it**

Why is it at that at this point, the only human rights groups that said anything are the Jewish ones (the REALLY Jewish ones, not like [JVP](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/jewish-voice-for-peace-is-neither/) and those clowns, they didn't care as well)?

Then Israel started bombing the convoys of Sunnis coming to Suwayda, and that's where the media started reporting it, and with the title being that Israel bombs Syria, with the massacres at best getting some mention in the middle of the article but sometimes not even mentioned at all

**Other**

Over the last decade Saudi Arabia killed 300k Yemenis (estimation) mostly by starvation, using European money and American weapons - how come is it almost never mentioned in the media?

In the past 2 years 150k Sudanese died in civil war, where is the outrage?

Why is it that when the Jews respond to the biggest massacre of Jews in 80 years, with more measures to limit civilian casualties than anyone has ever applied, it is reported as if it is the worst event that has ever happened and the Jews are literal demons? why is there this absurd double standard when it comes to the Jews?",Dex921,348,987,0.5799999833106995,0.1763073885314449,1752915213,/r/changemyview/comments/1m3rj87/cmv_the_complete_silence_current_massacre_of/,2025,7

Being a criminal does not make you a bad person, if all you ever do is speed a little or walk across the street outside of crosswalk but don't go on to hurt people or act recklessly then you're a pretty solid citizen, which is the best anybody can be since no one is perfect.

When i dont wanna have sex, ill just say it outright, if im hanging out with a FWB, and they try a move, ill just tell them like ''Hey, i dont want to have sex tonight'' and that will end the sexual interaction, and more women need to do this, we give way too much agency to the men.

  
Sorry if im not even making my point clear here, i guess i can expand more in the comments but i hope people get my overall point.

1m9nj6x,"CMV: Subreddits like r/radicalfeminism and the r/4Bmovement often express views that mirror hate-based ideologies like white supremacy, and it's harmful to feminism / shouldn't be allowed freely on this site.","I’ve come across posts and comments on subreddits like r/radicalfeminism and others connected to the 4B (4th wave, misandrist, separatist) movement that say things like:

“I’m an open misandrist.”

“I feel genuine fatigue listening to men talk.”

“Any woman who engages in heterosexual sex lacks self-respect.”

Reading this, it doesn’t just sound extreme or bitter it sounds like the kind of rhetoric used by hate groups throughout history. I know some will argue that the statistics about male violence or patriarchy make this kind of anger justifiable. But white supremacists say the exact same thing: they point to crime rates or economic disparities to justify their hatred of non-white people. Just because a group has disproportionate power or causes more harm in some areas doesn’t mean it’s okay to use hate-speech and it actively harms their point and probably makes it hard for people to get on board with them. That’s how prejudice works using group statistics to justify bias against individuals.

What makes this more concerning to me is that these subreddits aren’t even primarily about supporting women. They’re not centered on mutual aid, empowerment, or navigating systemic issues. Instead, the bulk of the content seems to be venting about how much they hate men, why men are worthless, or how women who associate with men are traitors or lacking self-respect.

I'm sick of pretending I care about men’s struggles....

These exemplify my point best because you could very easily change this language to be about race and I really doubt that would be allowed. 

It feels similar to how white supremacist groups focus less on helping white people and more on demonizing non-white people. The mindset seems less about empowerment and more about collective resentment.

I’m not denying that women face very real issues in society or that feminism has an important role. But I don’t think the answer is to build communities that normalize misandry. It's ok if you want to never talk to a man again but it's similar to a white person who avoids black people. If the same things were said about women or people of color, they’d be removed immediately and called out for what they are: hate speech.",analtaccount7,230,932,0.5699999928474426,0.15844232637373468,1753515825,/r/changemyview/comments/1m9nj6x/cmv_subreddits_like_rradicalfeminism_and_the/,2025,7
1lytmfs,CMV: True masculinity is advocating for those weaker than you,"

Growing up I was raised by all women and masculinity was something I struggled with. What is manliness? Working with your hands? Shooting guns? Eating steak? Being a stud in the bedroom? Lifting weights and getting swole? Fighting sports such as boxing or UFC? Cars? Being the provider? 

The list goes on and on right?

Now that I've entered my 30's and started a family of my own, I've really began to reflect on lessons handed down to me as a kid 

One of them was ""Boys lookout for family and protect girls, not hurt them""

I always thought this was a little weird but now I'm wondering if maybe it was tapping into something real and raw and amazing.

We as men should never be bully's unless we are speaking truth to power. Like a person with power who is bullying others deserves to be bullied. (DJT and his goons for example)

Men generally are in a position of power of others. People are less likely to start shit with a man versus a woman. 

We are listened to more than women. When our voice is used to advocate for others, it is taken muchmore seriously.

All of this is touching on the privilege of being a man. Obviously being a man has its downsides and there are drawbacks and issues with how society treats men but it is no question that you are dealt a better hand being born a man versus a woman.

So that said, true masculinity is advocating for those weaker than us. Whether it be disabled people. Mentally or physically. LGBTQ people. Women. Children. Animals. Or literally anyone who would have very little power and is being unfairly targeted or bullied.

This is my takeaway from my 30+ years on this planet. This is what it means to be a man. ",Infinite_Kush,1038,479,0.8199999928474426,0.15643053072219326,1752415509,/r/changemyview/comments/1lytmfs/cmv_true_masculinity_is_advocating_for_those/,2025,7
1md88sk,"CMV: the US ""culture war"" is just a billion dollar propaganda machine meant to keep white people terrified, alone, paranoid, depressed.","Over the course of the Vietnam War, white people who had historically been in favor of upholding and defending American institutions became anti-government because their sons kept getting shoved into a meat grinder in southeast Asia by Uncle Sam. There was genuine revolutionary furvor among large swaths of white America, so much so that they started to form local political coalitions with black communities with the explicit intent of destroying the war effort, in spite of many of them supporting Jim Crow just a few years earlier. Nixon made great haste to end the war to remove this pressure, and also hit his base with the classic ""silent majority"" line to bolster their racial fears and anxieties they had *just* started to overcome. This lead to a breaking of the fragile, barely formed ""rainbow coalition"" which stood to undermine the whole system if it had fully coalesced. With white people shoved back into cultural isolation, Nixon acolytes began to build a propaganda machine custom built to keep them scared shitless of their children and their neighbors. Every single ""culture war"" battle since has been these media entities propagandizing white people into kicking up a fuss about this or that, and then attempts to respond to that. Now we live in the natural end result of that: the male loneliness epidemic, high suicide rates among white people, white political paranoia, and a mountain of prescription opioids to ease the pain. Everything a byproduct of the alienation foisted on 5 generations of white people to keep them from truly connecting with their fellow countrymen.
