1nw8o3w,CMV: the only thing a bully understands is a bloody nose,"Please let me get the full context before you pass judgement, because I don't actually like this POV much, and I would love for it to change.  But this view is pretty solid in my understanding of the world from my own life experience and what I have seen around me.

In lower school, I was ostracized and picked on.  A LOT.  I was always small for my age and young for my level.  As a young boy, I was beat up a lot.  But I was always told fighting was ""bad"".  So it happened for many years until I finally had enough and I got really mean.  I started being the aggressor and got into trouble for it, but the bullies backed off.

Throughout humanity we see this same thing play out.  The work ""alpha male"" will be a bully and no one will check him.  Women too, the ""alpha"" female will belittle and attack others around her putting them down.  It isn't always physical, but damage is done.  And it seems that the system will actually protect the bully from retribution most times.  The sounds of a bully hitting a timid victim are not nearly as loud as when the victim shouts and fights back.  The teacher's attention is drawn by the disruption . . . not the act.  And as a result the victim is often punished for fighting back and causing the disruption.

Now, as a child I was advised to ""make friends"" with the bully, or to ""avoid"" them.  I learned through experience that a bully is a certain type of person. They are typically arrogant.  Usually bigger or stronger.  They are narcissistic.   And they love to show off their power over others publicly.   These types of people are not interested in polite discourse because that isn't what brings them pleasure.  They enjoy only power and wielding it over others at every chance they get.  Typically they grow up to be cops, or politicians, or other positions of power.  And the system is designed to protect them ""doing their jobs"".  

As bullies are disinterested (or incapable) of being approached with civility and words and discourse, there is only one way to alter their behavior, and it is the path I learned as a child.  You must make a scene, and bloody their nose.  And yes, that often means you get yours bloodied as well, but that was going to happen anyway.

Thus my conclusion . .  .the only way to handle a bully, is to turn around and punch them hard in the nose.  Hard enough that they think twice about coming after you again.  

I believe that this is the only option to live in peace.  The other options are to live as a victim, or avoid them at all costs and hope they can't find you.  Can you convince me that there is any other way to deal with a bully?  Especially when they wield political and ""legal"" power over you?

1nvyz9d,CMV: Anyone who thinks that the government shutdown is in any way the Democrats fault is either brainwashed or a traitor.,"Before anyone runs in to claim that I’m brainwashed by CNN, let me clarify with the following statement: I’m actually not a democrat. I’m left-leaning, but I don’t actually have political representation in the USA. The last 2 candidates that actually represented my beliefs were Andrew Yang (pre-NYC mayoral run), and before that Al Gore. That being said I have voted democrat because the alternative has always been significantly worse. Although I will say I would gladly vote for any republican candidate over Trump.   


Continuing: I think the dems are, by and large, a bunch of corrupt pieces of shit that have been playing chicken with the American people for the last 10 years. They keep on saying: “but you’re not gonna vote for him again, are ya?”, constantly ignore the desires of their constituents, and try to force their milquetoast brand of corporatism on a country that is fucking sick of it. Their idiot leadership is to blame for pushing America into trumps arms kicking and screaming, and are too fucking high on their supply to realize or understand just how incompetent they are.

  
All of this being said: at this point, it is very clear that Trump is pushing to turn the USA into a fascist dictatorship. If you disagree with that then just don’t comment, we’re living in different realities and there’s simply no point in you posting because you’re not going to convince me. 

Democrats have 2 choices: go along with the republicans and complain, or dig their heals in and refuse to do anything. For the last 2 years, voters have been complaining that the democrats have just been going along with the republicans: “why are you voting ‘yes’ on their judges?” “why are you voting ‘yes‘ on their bills” etc etc. 

Well, this is what \_not\_ doing that looks like. For once they’re actually doing what they should and not aiding and abetting the people that want to turn our country into a fascist dictatorship and your response is to… demonize them? What the fuck do you want? What should they do, instead, genius?

  
My guess is this is all a game to try to get democratic voters to believe that the democrats are the same, and not vote \_again\_ in the elections, the same way they did with the “genocide Joe” bullshit. I am just so unbelievably sick of moderates and ”purity test” democrats falling for this same bullshit again and again and again.

  
So.. a change my view. Am I reading the situation wrong? is this shutdown  actually dems fault?   


Were voters right to stay home in 2024 and give the election to Trump to avoid supporting “genocide Joe?”",CompellingProtagonis,264,192,0.7799999713897705,0.6402061855670103,1759396801,/r/changemyview/comments/1nvyz9d/cmv_anyone_who_thinks_that_the_government/,2025,10
1nw2zkh,CMV: Therian Furries Are Possibly Mentally Disturbed,"To be clear, I don't have any ill will towards every single furry. I know most of them still identify as humans and know and understand the logic there. What I don't understand is Therian Furries.

As far as I am aware, a Therian or Therian Furry genuinely believes that they are part or completely animal in being, and therefore, they dress as whatever animal they identify as.

Lycanthropy (the belief that one is essentially a werewolf) does extend beyond that typical definition into a lesser-used version that defines a mental derangement where a person believes that they are any kind of animal despite human biology.

Ultimately, a lot of these Therian people, in my opinion, could be mentally deranged or disturbed.

1nwhzb1,CMV: Not having a clearly accessible manual way to open car doors is just another sign that humanity is getting stupider,"I literally feel like we are in the movie Idiocracy. 

WHY ON EARTH ARE WE SWAPPING OUT MANUAL HANDLES THAT WORK WHEN IN A CAR WRECK, WITH ELECTRIC HANDLES WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE HUGE SAFETY HAZARDS IN A WRECK. At the very least if you need an aerodynamic and aesthetic door handle for your everyday use car then it should be a requirement that there is an easily accessible manual backup. Why car designers would put the backup door release beneath a floor mat is mindblowing to me. What adult or child's first thought when in an emergency is to look under the floormat for a backup exit method.

1nwf1hh,CMV: men are judged more harshly for enjoying porn than women are,"

At least according to Reddit emotions. For example, when a woman on reddit shares her joy for toys to satisfy herself, she often receives up votes and positive reinforcement, whereas there are a plethora of posts slamming men for enjoying porn to satisfy their needs because porn creates an unrealistic expectation that may be harmful for both men and women in sexual relationships. How is this any different than what a woman may expect from a man after being satisfied by a synthetic penis that never goes limp?",trufuschnick23,110,227,0.6000000238418579,0.4964400773195876,1759436961,/r/changemyview/comments/1nwf1hh/cmv_men_are_judged_more_harshly_for_enjoying_porn/,2025,10
1nw558z,CMV: Windows 10 end of support proves that Microsoft doesn't care about environment or climate change,"As of today 40% of all personal computers still run on Windows 10 (https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide). Microsoft is going to end support of the operating system which is run at the moment on almost 600 million PCs. Not only it has the potential of becoming the worst security disaster of all time, but it also, if Microsoft gets these people eventually to switch to Windows 11 will lead to hundreds of millions of PCs to be thrown into trash because they are incompatible and people will need to buy hundreds of millions of new PCs. This the single biggest forced retirement of hardware in the history of mankind that may generate, according to some estimates, 1 600 000 000 pounds of electronic waste.  What amount of carbon emissions will be needed to make hundreds of millions of new PCs? Huge amount.

If Microsoft cared about environment or climate change, it would continue provide security updates for Windows 10 until its userbase naturally declines to at least single digits. But it doesn't, so it stops the support basically blackmailing hundreds of millions of people to throw their old but perfectly working computers into trash.

1nvu4pi,CMV: There are no mass protests demanding Hamas accept the ceasefire deal because the protesters support Hamas even if they don't recognize it.,"There is a deal on the table that is endorsed by countries that dislike Israel.  The deal was never going to be absolutely balanced to include all of Hamas's demands because they are a terrorist group.  The deal includes a gradual withdrawal of the IDF in stages, the release of all hostages and thousands of Palestinian prisoners, an immediate surge in aid and promises of reconstruction of Gaza by wealthy Gulf states, and ensures Palestinians are not expelled from Gaza.

The deal also requires Hamas to disarm from offensive weapons and have no future role in governing Gaza.

The reason why people are not demanding despite their previous calls for a ceasefire is that they indeed do support Hamas.  They view the deal as a surrender of Hamas. Their protests were never about the war. They hate Israel more than they care about Gaza.  This carries over to loud pro-Palestinian voices online who for months, have been calling for an ""end to the genocide,"" and now that there is an ""end to the genocide"" being offered, they are demanding the deal be rejected because it puts Hamas in a weak position.   Everything the crux of the protests was supposed to be about is now being offered and there are no demands that Hamas accept it/

1nwdrs1,"CMV: Reddit's algorithm has made it practically impossible to build communities around slow, thoughtful content","I created a subreddit (about 600 subscribers now) for absurdist literature writing. For months, posts got a few votes: mine, excerpts from established writers, and submissions from \~5 other community members. Then I posted something political: 1000+ votes in less than 12 hours, and so many comments mostly from accounts I'd never seen. At first I thought this revealed a new Reddit AI content detection steering feeds toward controversy. But the real gut-punch was simpler and sadder: It occurs to me now that the very few semi-active members who ignored months of creative content immediately engaged with the political post, thus triggering the classic engagement algorithm.

Here's my view: Reddit's algorithm has trained users to scroll past anything requiring cognitive effort. Reading creative writing takes time and thoughtful response takes effort. Political opinions are instant and effortless. The algorithm rewards speed over substance, so even in a new community explicitly built for slow-burn content, quick-reaction posts win every time. It's that the content type itself can't compete when the platform's incentive structure makes ""instant dopamine hit"" the only viable content. Our small sub's subscribers liked the idea of absurdist literature but were conditioned by Reddit to not really actually engage with it. You can't build a new thoughtful creative communities here anymore.

1nw8005,"CMV: The Democratic Party is on the way to a breakup, possibly as soon beginning in 2028","I, as a non-MAGA conservative leaning individual, have a lot of thoughts about the modern DNC. I thought about making this about why they continue to chronically lose winnable situations (ie, losing to Trump. Twice!). That’s for another day.

My position is that, based on current trends. The DNC will break up in my lifetime (I’m 30). And, if JD Vance (or whoever I guess) wins the whitehouse in 2028 (and you can’t say that’s impossible, given the party’s recent track record and abysmal party approval ratings), the break up will begin.

Because 

1. People don’t want to lose, especially to the likes of Trump or Vance. But
2. They keep doing it and 
3. They can’t seem to agree on why they’re losing, or the remedy.

Progressives want the whole party to go left. Moderates and independents are already saying the party has gone too far left. The progressives will not just continue to watch the DNC lose without taking action.

Therefore. They’re cruising for a breakup (which I think is a strategic error of immense proportions but whatever I guess do you). 

If they lose in 2028, again, to a conservative they hate, again.

A lot of people try and tell me that combat sports are stupid because you're going to get CTE, but then turn around and play football on the weekends/in college. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me for a few reasons: 1. In combat sports there's weight classes, so you won't have a guy with potentially 100lb+ on you crashing into you with full force.
2. There's a different culture about injuries in football vs combat sports. For example in American football it's very common to be pressured into playing through concussions and other injuries leading to multiple impacts after someone is already hurt. Whereas in combat sports a concussion or other injury usually ends the match.
3. Skill potential. In American football I dont believe your personal skill can mitigate injuries to a significant extent, but in combat sports skill is the #1 deciding factor as to who gets injuries and who doesn't.

1nw2qzf,CMV: Left wingers refusing to embrace AI is a huge mistake politically,"As someone who identifies as liberal, I’ve found it increasingly difficult to talk about the practical uses of AI without facing backlash. If you try posting an AI-generated image or anything pro-AI within a left-leaning online community, you’ll likely understand what I mean. Many people in these spaces refuse to engage with the topic at all. Some dismiss AI as a passing trend, while others view it as inherently unethical, believing it steals from creators and should be avoided entirely.

In contrast, the political right has embraced AI with enthusiasm. On platforms like X, AI content is often celebrated. Right wingers are using it to make music, videos, and images, and there’s widespread support for its role in automating jobs and reshaping industries. 

I believe this divide is a serious strategic misstep. AI is not going away. I strongly believe it will continue to evolve and become as commonplace as the internet itself. Whether we like it or not, those who avoid using AI risk falling behind, especially in entertainment and the workplace.

1nvqb6e,CMV: Any explanation of god is either logical and paradoxical or illogical and unknowable,"I’m trying to think critically about the concept of God and the explanations humans have developed. Here’s the issue as I see it:
	1.	Logical explanations of God (like those in most organized religions) attempt to systematize God in human terms. They claim he’s omnipotent, omniscient, and all-loving. But when you try to map those traits onto reality, contradictions appear: free will vs. omniscience, conditional love vs. true love, God’s nature vs. being infinite, etc. In other words, logical explanations inevitably create paradoxes.
	2.	Illogical or mystical explanations (like apophatic theology, Sufi mysticism, or Daoism) embrace the idea that God is beyond human understanding. But if an explanation is illogical or unknowable, it can’t really form a system — you can’t claim to know anything about it in a structured way.

Even faith-based defenses seem to fall into this trap: they argue that God transcends logic, but they rely on reasoning to make that claim, which uses the very logic they say doesn’t apply.

So my conclusion: any explanation of God is either logical and paradoxical, or illogical and unknowable. I think this insight might generalize to almost all attempts at defining or systematizing the divine.

I’m posting here because I’m genuinely curious if I’m missing something. Could there be an explanation of God that escapes this dichotomy?

1nvqt21,cmv: revolution in Russia would probably end up a bad thing.,"cmv: Revolution in Russia could end up being a very bad thing. 


Now let me be clear the current Russia regime is committing war crimes in Ukraine, Starving their own citizens for personal gain and because of failed policies and is a brutal regime with few if any redeeming qualities. However a revolution and change to a new regime would probably not end in the democratic Russia most people seem to think it would. For one no previous Russian revolution/Regime change has created democracy long term, the 1991 collapse was more so a temporary lapse in absolute power and shifted Russia from a communist dictatorship more so to a oligarchical dictatorship. History does tend to repeat itself and quite frankly a power grab with nuclear weapons on the table seems a little scarier than the current Russian government. At least with the current regime we kinda understand what we have if the Russians were to revolt separate of say a post Nazi Germany style occupation/reform we would very likely see incredible infighting and whoever came out on top would probably end up being even more authoritarian in an attempt to solidify a thin grip on power. This is ignoring regions like chechnya or the tartars and other groups in the Caucasus far east and anyone else who thought now was a good time to get independence. The most likely scenario baring nuclear weapons being used would be a 100 way civil war with hundreds of thousands if not millions of causalities.

1nw5k9u,"CMV: There should be a liquid funds cap, luxury wealth tax, and the banning of borrowing against stock","I really think there needs to be a huge shift in how we view money. I think if there were a liquid cap where when you reach 3 million + you don't earn anymore income. You don't need anymore than that to live comfortably for decades. Lifestyle plays a part, but I think if we sell the idea that if you hit 3 million or more you have won the game of life. You have achieved the highest goal in life - you can reinvest this money into society in order to see how quickly you can do it all over again. 

I also think to curtail hoarding, wealth tax should be implemented and we should ban the borrowing against stock for loans - it has to be visible assets to be used as collateral. Obviously, people will try and look for loopholes, but I think there are ways to mitigate this.

Below is my suggested plan:

# Liquid Funds Cap

* Cap individual or trust liquid assets, including cash, bank deposits, money market funds, and initial plus subsequent stock contributions valued at cost net of withdrawals, at $3 million.  
* Individuals or trusts exceeding the cap cannot accumulate income above $150,000 until liquid assets fall under the limit.  
* Cap provides a clear “financial finish line,” promoting equity while preventing excessive liquidity hoarding.

If someone says:



""Hey, I have reached over 3 million, but based on my lifestyle it would only last 5 years. What should I do? If I stop working I'm going to be behind, but if I keep working I'm working for free.""



I think this would highlight how money is equated to meaning in life. This person has multiple options. They could keep working - if they actually like what they do then keeping up to things will justify staying, they don't need the extra money. But if their work is only important because of money then this gives them a new opportunity to find something new to do in life.They can work part time or take a sabbatical, or split their earnings to stock, charity, and spending it to invest in society - bringing it down to below 150k immediately so they can earn income again. Their options are limitless. It's encouraged to invest, and those that contribute to charities get tax cuts which is an incentive to do so.  
  


# Progressive Luxury Wealth Tax

* Progressive tax on additional luxury real estate (primary residence exempted).  
* Taxes on luxury vehicles, yachts, art, and collectibles.  
* Discourages visible wealth concentration, reduces speculative bubbles, and funds social programs and infrastructure.  

# Borrowing Ban Against Stocks

* Prohibit borrowing against stocks to prevent the ""buy-borrow-die"" avoidance strategy, ensuring taxes on gains when liquidity is accessed.  

# Trust Rules

* Trusts cannot hold unrealized gains untaxed; gains trigger capital gains tax or disallowing tax-free holding.  
* Liquid assets within trusts counted by cumulative cash contributions minus withdrawals, included in the $3 million cap.  
* Trust beneficiaries’ earned income limited if cap exceeded, preventing evasion.  

# Married Couples Filing

* Option for joint filing with proportionally increased liquid cap and additional tax benefits, or separate filing applying individual caps.  
* Dependent children’s incomes aggregated with parents unless filing separately and independently.  

# Enforcement, Transparency, and Reporting

* Mandatory detailed reporting on liquid assets, borrowings, trusts, and related entities.  
* Broaden definition of collateral and assets to close substitution loopholes.  
* Severe penalties and comprehensive audits, coordinated across agencies and internationally.  

# Inflation Control and Economic Stability

* Reduced excess liquidity and speculative demand help dampen asset inflation.  
* Tax revenues invested in affordable housing, infrastructure, and social services to alleviate supply-side inflation.  

# Social and Economic Impact

* Reduces extreme wealth inequality.  
* Encourages wealth circulation for broader social benefit.  
* Fosters economic fairness and political stability.  

# Anti-Loophole Provisions:

# Stepped-Up Basis Loophole Closure

* Tax unrealized capital gains on inherited assets above exemption thresholds at death.  
* Eliminate stepped-up basis except for exempt assets like primary residences under limits.  
* Allow credit for paid gains against estate taxes.  
* Require full reporting and disclosure of estate valuation.  

# Partnership and Pass-Through Abuse Mitigation

* Expanded disclosure of income, ownership, basis, and transfers.  
* Limit basis adjustments preventing income shifting.  
* Grant enhanced audit authority.  

# Tax-Loss Harvesting Restrictions

* Expand wash sale rules.  
* Use analytics to detect abusive loss realization patterns.  

# Carried Interest Reclassification

* Tax carried interest as ordinary income.  
* Require clear income stream reporting.  

# Caps and Rules on Tax-Deferred Accounts and Insurance Products

* Limit contributions and account sizes for ultra-high-net-worth individuals.  
* Impose minimum distribution or tax on excessive balances.  
* Mandatory annual reporting of account valuations.  

# Estate and Gift Tax Tightening

* Lower gift tax exemptions.  
* Restrict valuation discounts for family transfers.  
* Rigorous gift reporting and audit.  

# Income Shifting Controls

* Tighten related-party transaction rules requiring fair market compensation.  
* Aggregate dependent income with parents unless independently filed.

Just to state I am not conservative, I vote Labour in the UK and am not white. My views on topics like immigration are nuanced and my own. 

Across the western world we have seen a sharp uptick of movements towards the right often the non tradition populist right or even in some countries the far right. 

In many cases the shift of specifically parties like the Democrats and the Labour Party towards university educated voters and ethnic minorities whilst maintaining neoliberal foreign policy led to outright dismissal over concerns about, immigration (millions of people seeking better lives but in an unmanaged flow) , affordable housing ( many young people especially in places like London Vancouver, Toronto, Sydney but also many medium sized cities struggling to afford decent housing), proper policing (specifically anti social behaviour, the role of a stable family etc) and foreign military adventures (Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan for a while Syria). 

Libya in particular sanctioned by Obama and participated in by the centre right British PM David Cameron (in effect a liberal if he were in America) and French President Sarkozy led to those horrible images of people drowning in the Mediterranean as Libya became a hub of people smugglers after the fall of Gaddafi. This is to say nothing about what his fall did to the Sahel region where Islamists with looted Libyan weapons now cause new refugee flows toward Europe. To add onto this the then German chancellor Angela Merkel during the Syrian Civil War unilaterally decided to open the doors to refugees coming from Syria (soon joined by others) which led to scenes were hundreds of thousands of people literally marched across Europe to get to Germany and Sweden something which whilst humane no one voted for and with no thought to the long term consequences. We now see the AfD polling historically high in Germany. 

This does not even speak of the billions spent in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya by western governments and other places when much of the population was being told there wasn’t money for education, housing or infrastructure. 

In the UK the Labour government under Tony Blair failed to take up what the EU allowed as a break against unrestricted immigration from new members who were at the time economically much poorer which led to millions of people arriving in the UK which is one of the densest populated nations on earth. It was not unusual at the time for even mild concerns about immigration to be framed as racism. Nothing serious was put in place for people to have more children, or build more housing for the booming population and therefore reduce the strain and reliance on immigration even after the UK left the EU.  Again no one ever voted for high immigration numbers like this. Now we see the anti immigration Reform Party polling highest of all major parties in the UK. 

Meanwhile in the United States a sort of  sanctioned baiting of often not just non liberal but non political people led to an obvious backlash. The wave of cancel culture in America for example whilst rightfully getting rid of many people guilty of serious offences veered sharply into people disrupting normal comedy shows, attacking guest speakers at universities, accusing relatively mainstream figures of being facists and seemingly actively painting all non liberal, big city university educated white people as irredeemable. Professors often were self censoring or being berated in front of students and even well meaning concerns from not very political people say on gender issues (what age should kids be on puberty blockers, what’s should we do about sports or female only spaces) were treated as being hateful. 

All this to my mind made talk about race long dormant (problematic I know but direct attacks on people race ‘male, pale and stale’ was not the wisest ways of fixing that)  suddenly legitimised, cynicism on all foreign intervention (even for worthy and actual causes we can help properly like Ukraine) seem legitimate and identity not economics be the main driver of politics.

1nvwitp,CMV: Abrahamic God is Evil,"Let me ask you a question: who kills and oppresses more people in the Bible, God or Satan? One has caused flood, famine, disaster, orders genocide like a Big Mac, smites cities, tortures individuals, actively wants you to fear him, gaslights you into thinking that by your very nature you are evil, and repeatedly withholds vital information from mankind. The other is a Promethean figure who has brought knowledge and self-awareness to humanity, making us more human than the former ever has. Yet the latter is evil and the former is omnibenevolent? Interesting. For the reccord, I don't worship Satan because the idea of Satan is stupid and he doesn't exist.

If God knows everything that is going to happen yet still lets it happen and says ""well, I need to punish you"" even though he knew it was coming anyway and supposedly has the power to stop it, he is just being sadistic. Satan does not do such evil. God restricted salvation to a select ethnic group he arbitrarily favors for millennia, damning everyone else to eternal suffering. Here are direct quotes from the Bible + analysis that prove God’s evil:

1. Genocide of the Amalekites “Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.” — 1 Samuel 15:3 Actively calls for the annihilation and genocide of a distinct ethnic group for their differing beliefs. Because they are not Israelites, they cannot achieve salvation, so better to kill them I guess.
2. Killing of the firstborn in Egypt “At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock.” Killing children.
3. The Flood — wiping out almost all life “For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die.” — Genesis 6:17 Insanely horrible genocide that would have killed millions. I do not know why God would want to punish all humans for immoral behavior if he only bothered revealing himself to one ethnicity and limited salvation just to them anyways.
4. Cannibalism as divine punishment “And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters.” — Leviticus 26:29 Yuck.
5. Genocide of the Midianites “Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.” — Numbers 31:17–18 Another genocide ordered.
6. Hardening Pharaoh’s heart “But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, Pharaoh will not listen to you.” — Exodus 7:3–4 God repeatedly overrides Pharaoh’s free will so that he won’t let the Israelites go, only to punish him and Egypt for it. Insane sadism.
7. Sending delusion to deceive people “Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” — 2 Thessalonians 2:11–12 Tempts people into delusion only to punish them later for it, the exact same thing Satan is blamed for.
8. Blinding Israel so they cannot repent “He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them.” — John 12:40 (quoting Isaiah 6:10) Putting afflictions on people to override their free will and be able to punish them for it.
9. Forcing people to sin so He can punish them “I will put a hook in your jaw and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales. I will draw you up out of the midst of your streams… I will cast you into the wilderness.” — Ezekiel 29:4–5 More manipulating the Pharaoh into doing evil and punishing him and his entire nation for it.
10. Obedience over independence “Know well the condition of your flocks, and give attention to your herds.” — Proverbs 27:23 Here humans are analogized to livestock requiring oversight. One of many times humans/followers are intentionally likened to sheep, showing God wants obedient and foolish followers. Mental oppression.",Round_Guess4030,0,119,0.41999998688697815,0.1859375,1759387393,/r/changemyview/comments/1nvwitp/cmv_abrahamic_god_is_evil/,2025,10
1nwag65,CMV: The Human Race Will Split Up into 2 Races Eventually. The Smarter Upper Class and the Servile Class.,"This is what happens when everything becomes globalized and the middle class starts to go away. Especially with the advent of Ai, there’s less of a reason for businesses to give jobs to lower class people anymore beyond what’s most cost effective. If it’s more cost effective to feed slaves, they’ll do  that. If it’s more cost effective to supply energy to a robot they’ll do that. But eventually, there will be no way for the lower class to rise above and join the upper class, because the whole world will be a globalized government one world order that’s enforced by robots that are impossible to overthrow. 

Therefore the best thing you can do right now is to try to rise to the 1% financially, because that’s what all the smart people are doing if they want to pass their genes on to other smart, effective people (because smart people tend to earn more money. That’s a generalization btw, so no need to take it personal. I know like sucks and depression holds people back.) 

Eventually it’ll just be smart people with all the money breeding with the other smart people while the poor class becomes straight up slaves or replaced, with lower incentives to prioritize intelligence since there’s no way to gain rank in their society once the middle class is gone.

1nwdr12,CMV: Men are discriminated against - even though they are more successful,"More jobs – especially social work and roles with children – openly state that men’s applications will not be considered.

**Men are expected to be a “man” before they can be a human.** They are ridiculed if they are soft, emotional, not career-focused, or prioritize work-life balance. Men are drilled to be cold, ruthless, and career-driven – and coincidentally, these traits are exactly what people look for in leadership positions. Women rarely have the same cards in a career, while men’s behavior reflects this pressure.

**Yes, men are more “successful”** in our heavily materialistic society. But this comes at the cost of their humanity. Most men can’t – and often don’t even want to – be soft, show emotions, or choose a less ambitious life. This leads to higher stress, more violence, more illness and injuries, shorter lifespans, and higher rates of violent suicide.

We are fighting for women to be more like men: to have the same chances at material success. But is that really what we want? Women already have a happier life. They have more freedom to express themselves and choose what they want to do with their lives, at the cost of having less successful careers.

Yes, we should fight for equality. But instead of pushing women to adopt a more miserable, materialistic path, we should fight for men to have a happier life – to be allowed to just be human. Men lost their humanity in our materialistic, capitalistic system. It’s easy to say men are “favored” because we can measure money, but not freedom, happiness, or feelings.

We should fight for men – so they are allowed to lead less “successful” lives, and in doing so, women benefit too. When men are freer and more human, society as a whole becomes more balanced and fair.

1nwgv4h,CMV: The Democratic Party needs to become the party of fiscal responsibility.,"My view is in the title. The current administration has, and is continuing, to divide the US. See, for example, the various websites that blame the “Radical Left” for the current government shutdown. (HUD.gov, USDA.gov, many others).

The Democratic Party has, in my opinion, leaned further left, as if playing tug-of-war. I think this has driven even more moderate votes across the aisle.

I think while dems have a lot of good intentions, I think the best possible move right now is a re-branding, and I think that re-brand needs to be centered around money and global dominance from a long-term economic perspective.

Democrats, to be successful, need to consistently blast Republicans with facts and statistics. FOR INSTANCE:

We have increased the spending of TAXPAYER DOLLARS to DECREASE GDP.

(Spending increase)
https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex

(GDP Decrease)
https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/09/24/us-latino-immigrants-gdp-report-says.html

You would have to have substantial experience bankrupting enterprises to come up with a plan like this. How does this make sense from an economic perspective for the country?

Why are we DECREASING the IRS workforce, which is the source of 96% of government funding and has the highest ROI of any government spending?
(https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research)

If you don’t like the tax law, change it. Don’t defund those making sure it is followed. Defunding the IRS is cutting the source of funds available for important programs, like NATIONAL DEFENSE.

Housing is unaffordable. Plain and simple. Let’s cut tax breaks for depreciation on residential real estate of 4 units or less for properties that appreciate in value over time, and also section 1031 exchanges and step up in bases which allow capital gains from sales to be deferred INDEFINITELY. Just by making these tax changes, the asset class would be less desirable and corporate ownership would naturally decrease over time.

The big beautiful bill did expand the LIHTC, which I view as a positive for the construction of low-income housing. 

However, as a whole, the bill is going to increase the deficit substantially. Here, it’s estimated to increase by $3.4 Trillion over the next 10 years: https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-does-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-cost/

There’s a lot of important social issues that have divided the country. I don’t disagree that those social issues need to be tackled, but I think it’s a framing issue. Take the racial wealth gap…

Let’s look at it through a simple lense:

White people have more money. If you have a white family that starts with $1M in wealth and a non-white family that has $100K in wealth, this disparity will continue to compound. Assume both have living costs of $20K per year and a 10% ROI on their investments. (Also assume no other income, despite the fact that white people also make more money on average)… You don’t have to be a math expert to figure out that the white family will have even more money by the time the non-white family runs out. 

(See https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/wealth-inequality-and-the-racial-wealth-gap-20211022.html)

Why don’t we want everyone to be wealthier? We can tax them more later as they contribute more to GDP. Further, widening wealth disparity between races will lead to more societal issues in our country, which seems bad not only for ethical reasons (which I am suggesting the Dems need to get away from arguing for) but also for long-term stability and risk of civil unrest, which would negatively impact GDP. It’s messed up, but think of treating people right as an insurance policy against a race war and deepening divide in our country. 

Perhaps there’s a better way to frame it, but essentially I think substantially all Dem issues should be boiled down to - does this issue impact GDP or Risk in a way that can be easily enough explained to the general public? If not, let’s not make it a focal point at the moment.

This might all be a moot point by the time 2028 rolls around. I’ve been ruminating on this and just think it would be a very powerful shift in Democratic leadership to focus on long-term economic strategy and to broadcast that. 

China thinks long-term, generationally. We need to think that way, too.

I’m not a political expert, just some guy that reads headlines once in awhile and is speaking from my general layman’s perspective.

I have more thoughts but I’m rambling. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

1nw6kaj,"CMV: the ""houses used to be cheao"" argument is flawed","Disclaimer: I'm not in the US and have never lived there. I'll be talking on the basis of my experuence in a communist eastern european country and a country in the Alps. I'm also talking about lower-middle-class or working-class families, not the poorest people around but not exactly rich either. Eg most of us. 

A lot of people want to buy a house or an appartment, especially when they start building a family. But it isn't that easy, right ? 

You want a house in a suburb somewhere, reasonably close to the comforts of a city but not too close to the pollution. You want to have nature close by, for your kids. 

You want a bedroom for each kid, or at worst they'll be two to a bedroom. 

You want a nice garage for your car and possibly your partner's. 

You want good isolation, to save on heating. 

You want a nice modern building and nice neighbors. 

You want a more well-off neighborhood, or your kids may meet bad influences and start doing drugs and skipping school. 

You want to be close to a good kindergarten or primary school. 

You want a nice view. 

You want a little supermarket close by, in case you urgently need household items. 

You want to be close to both your workplace and your partner's. 

You want a nice allergen-free environment. 

Your parents or grandparents didn't want all these things. 

They lived in a two-bedroom home, along with their kids and at least one grandparent. 

They lived in a home with poor isolation and used blankets or carpets to cover the walls in winter, and simply left the house in the summer heat. 

The lived in an old building with noisy neighbors in a working-class neighborhood. 

They lived close to whatever school there was, or maybe they didn't live close to a school at all. 

They didn't have a car, and if they did they just parked it in the street. 

If there was mold or mice, well, tough luck. 

So now ask yourself: would you be able to buy such a house ? Yes, probably. But you have higher standards, so you wouldn't even consider something like that. You're asking why you can't buy a diamond necklace when your parents and grandparents could buy silver necklaces.

Hell, a salad can be a sandwich if it has croutons in it, because croutons are bread and the lettuce is in between the croutons sometimes. 

Tacos are not sandwiches though, that’s taking it too far. It has to be bread and tacos are made from corn tortillas. Perhaps you can argue that burritos are sandwiches because it’s made from flour which is what bread is made out of, but you’d be wrong because it’s only 1 slice of bread. Yes hot dog buns are attached, but only barely, it’s still technically 2 slices of bread because they fall apart all of the time.

1nvx5zf,CMV: AI 'Artists' Don't Know What Art Is,"The ability to describe an image in evocative language is a skill, but not equivalent to the years of practice required to draw, paint, or sculpt it into existence. Claiming the title of *artist* by those who solely use AI is not merely a matter of semantic debate, but a misnomer stemming from a misconception of what art truly is and a weak grasp of the nature of the technology they employ. AI image generation is similar to commissioning not creating. If I hire a baker to make a cake or a pilot to fly a plane I am the client or passenger not the baker or pilot. The prompt engineer is an art director or curator of probabilities, but not the creator the work.  
  
Art is more than the output. The finished work hanging in a gallery or displayed on a screen is the product of a complex human journey. This process is filled with intent, emotion, and lived experience. AI executes a prompt, it statistically assembles pixels based on patterns from its training data. Only valuing the final image is to devalue the work that goes into genuine art.  
  
Artists’ criticisms that it is theft is often dismissed by claiming that all art is theft, that human artists being inspired or influenced is the same thing. This argument misunderstands both the technology and the nature of the artists' grievances. Human influence is an act of synthesis, not replication. When a painter is inspired, they are not copying brushstrokes pixel-for-pixel; they are interpreting the technique, emotional intensity, and the use of color through the filter of their own sensibility and experience. This is a transformative process that adds to the cultural conversation. AI, when prompted to create “in the style of”, the model performs a mathematical recombination of that artist’s work, without their consent, credit, or compensation.  
  
We need to give credit to the human artists whose labor built the datasets and acknowledge that the true nature of the artistic process can not be replicated by machines.",artyspangler,0,77,0.4699999988079071,0.1203125,1759389808,/r/changemyview/comments/1nvx5zf/cmv_ai_artists_dont_know_what_art_is/,2025,10
1nwc0ir,"CMV: I don't need to experience something to tell someone who has, why their opinions are wrong.","Hi. White, straight male Left-Anarchist here.   
  
Liberalism will never emancipate the black population from systematic racism. Liberalism will never do any long term tangible justice for feminism. I will inform a black woman who is a liberal, about why she is fundamentally wrong about using liberal means to overcome oppression. And as an anti-capitalist I will view you as nothing short than a liberal, if you were to morally argue why educating this black liberal woman on why she is wrong. 

Tankies: China, USSR, DPRK are irrefutably state-capitalist. You only call me a latte drinking first world rich socialist, because this is your last line of defence. Let's not forget there are Americans who think America is a democracy too. Or are you going to say ""yeah but they are being lied too""? Because people from so called ""ML"" countries are also being lied too. Even if I have never been to China, that does fuck all to disqualify me from educating people who live in China on why they are not living in a socialist country(and by ""not a socialist country"" I also mean it is NOT HALF socialist either). 

To be abundantly clear, in case there are sticklers in the crowd. I am not saying I believe that there's some sort of legal repercussions I will face by educating black liberal women or people from China why Liberalism and Marxist-Leninism always fails. I am merely saying if you end the debate with ""you're not this, so you can't say that"" it automatically means, regardless of personal experience(unless they are flat out denying your experience i.e ""you as a black person are lying about the police beating you up"") then you are ADMITTING you cannot argue your point.   
  
People of oppressed classes are not monoliths. Plenty of leftists in China oppose the CPC. Likewise, during the BLM riots in 2020, there were plenty of leftist black people who advocated for white comrades to arrived armed.(for those who don't know, leftists are pro-gun, liberals are anti-gun). However there are also black liberals who would say it's wrong for white allies to bring guns. I see no issue (if it's called for) for me to bring a gun to a blm protest and debate these liberals. 

Likewise, by ""you're not this, so shut up""  has to go the other way around. Sure we can argue internalized oppression in it's obvious forms disqualifies the speaker i.e ""As a black person, i think slavery was a good thing.""  Of course nobody is saying Ye should be the head spoke's person of the black community. However this gets tricky when reactionaries utilize the oppression of others (""gay rights are hurting the black community"") or when they themselves are educated on internalization (""I am a black rights activist and I think it's wrong white people can't say the n-word."") 

The irony is, I'm using liberals and Marxists in my example because I know for a fact you both will say the same shit about each other. That China is state-capitalist regardless of what Chinese people say. That Kamala Harris is inherently irrelevant to feminism and black rights, regardless of what black liberal women say. 

Oh and right wingers...I actually nothing on you....Mhmm.. \*scratches head\*  As a non- Christian I can state the irrefutable fact that 99% of right wing Christians will go to hell if Christianity does turn out to be true... Or as someone who's never served, Western Imperialism is best case scenario about taking people's rights away and worst case scenario about genocide(Gaza and Vietnam as holocaust level examples, despite hiding behind the broken argument of ""but that's just war!"")

1nwgdq2,cmv: common law is better than civil law,"In a nutshell: Common law is, at least in principle, the better system. Not just because it is the newer, more recent system, but because it grew as an adaptive response to the realities of human societies and into a system that is inherently flexible, precedent-driven, and closer to lived human experience. Civil, on the other hand, has its roots in Roman law and is built on the provably wrong and stupid idea that societies function like perfectly logical, consistent and self-contained programs.

Us Germans grow up surrounded by the folklore that our law is uniquely precise and scientifically exact. You see it in news articles praising the BGB as the “seventh world wonder” or famous judges giving speeches claiming ""German law is a lot like maths"" or in the way lawyers are represented as the ultimate masters of logic,. This idea is reinforced until it feels like common sense: German law is supposedly the most correct, consistent, and reliable in the world.

Law students then enter university and are drilled in *Gutachtenstil*, an Aristotelian syllogism dressed up as legal method:

* **Obersatz** (major premise, the norm)
* **Untersatz** (minor premise, the facts)
* **Schlussfolgerung** (the conclusion)

It looks like mathematics. Apply the formula (the statute), plug in the variables (the facts), and out pops the inevitable answer.

Anglo-American students also use structured reasoning, but nobody pretends it works like a machine. In Germany, by contrast, students are taught that this is literally how law functions, that the syllogism is not just a presentation tool but the very logic of the legal system itself. Most lawyers never question it, and many go through their entire careers believing this pseudo-mathematical performance is reality.

In truth, the dream of a logically consistent system was baked into the **Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)** of 1900, drafted under the ideology of *Begriffsjurisprudenz*. Its authors wanted a legal “geometry,” perfect and self-contained. The reality is very different. Scholars have shown that the BGB contains thousands of contradictions, with some counts exceeding 3,000. Instead of a flawless system, it is riddled with overlaps, conflicts, and gaps. Lawyers often retreat into **Auffangtatbestände** (catch-all provisions) when the pseudo-logic breaks down, pretending deduction worked when in fact interpretation and value judgments carried the day. I've spoken to lawyers who don't even attempt to walk some logically consistent path through the German BGB anymore and instead just rely catch-all-provisions.

Meanwhile, Common Law, so often derided in Germany as chaotic or “unscientific,” is at least honest. It does not pretend to be math. Judges openly ask which precedents are more convincing, which analogy makes sense, and which line of reasoning fits best. It is rhetoric and persuasion, yes, but it acknowledges that law is about argument in a changing society, not deduction from eternal axioms.

This brings us to the bigger point. Civil law confuses a complicated system with a complex one.

* **Complicated systems** (machines, equations) can be described by internally consistent rules. If you know the formula, you know the outcome.
* **Complex systems** (societies, economies, human relations) are adaptive and emergent. Their “rules” shift constantly, and they cannot be captured in a closed logic.

Civil law tried to build a machine for society, and the Nazis showed how dangerous that can be. They did not simply act outside the law. Instead, they reshaped the legal system so that their atrocities were formally lawful. From the Reichstag Fire Decree to the Nuremberg Laws, Nazi jurists meticulously crafted rules that gave their crimes a veneer of legality. In common law you eventually learn that this was one of the regime’s defining features: legality itself became a tool of oppression. Did any of my German law professors mention this? Nope.

After the war, by the way, this positivist shield collided with the Nuremberg Trials. Under German and civil-law principles, there was no basis for retroactive punishment: *nulla poena sine lege, i.e.* no crime without a law. Yet the tribunal rejected that defense, holding that crimes against humanity and aggressive war violated universal norms that no legal system could erase. This reasoning drew heavily on Common Law traditions and natural law ideas, affirming that certain rights are inviolable regardless of whether a legislature has codified them.

It took Common Law traditions, case-driven, adaptive, willing to evolve through practice, to articulate justice beyond the limits of a code.

Mind you, I did not just wake up one day thinking Common Law is better. It was a long, painful journey. Originally, I wanted to study physics, maths or computer science, something where logic really is logic and the rules and axioms are clear. But I was convinced to study law instead. I ended up at the University of Mannheim, doing both a German law degree and a British law degree (both bachelors, Mannheim is special in that regard).

At first, I was proud of the German approach. Coming from maths and physics, the *Gutachtenstil* felt like a natural extension of my mindset. You take the rule as the major premise, plug in the facts as the minor premise, and out comes the conclusion. It sounded and initially seemed like solving equations. Like many Germans, I genuinely believed our legal system was uniquely rigorous, logical, and exact.

But that illusion collapsed quickly. I realized the German side of my studies was not really about logic at all. It was about memorization and ritual. Endless drills in *Gutachtenstil*, endless pretending that syllogisms delivered “the” correct answer, endless professors marking you down if your chain of reasoning did not mirror their preferred doctrinal school. There was almost no space for real argumentation. It felt less like law and more like a pseudo-mathematical cult. I hated every minute of it.

In common law we debated cases, analogies, principles and reasoning was openly persuasive rather than an endless exercise in how to arrange statutes like Lego bricks.

But I really only fully understood, when I'd finally graduated and went back to my roots to study a third subject: computer science. Specifically, logic, algorithms, and complexity theory. That is when it hit me. The German civil-law project was trying to treat society like a complicated system, a machine with fixed parts that could be solved by deduction. But society is a complex system, adaptive, evolving, constantly changing its own rules. No amount of syllogisms can capture that. Suddenly I understood why the German approach felt so suffocating and false, and why the British system, messy, argumentative, precedent-driven, actually makes sense.",SparklyCould,23,52,0.6899999976158142,0.11088917525773195,1759439917,/r/changemyview/comments/1nwgdq2/cmv_common_law_is_better_than_civil_law/,2025,10
1nvzo9u,"CMV: The vast majority of problems ""caused by"" illegal drugs can be solved with drug reform and education.","The vast majority of drug related deaths are due to opioids. Opioid overdoses are reversible if naloxone (narcan) is administered in time. Naloxone has no abuse potential and cannot be overdosed, therefore by simply making naloxone available OTC we can reduce opioid deaths.

Drugs are not Russian roulette. Drugs have predictable effects when the purity and dose of the substance is known. This is true for illegal drugs as well as any medication. Drug testing would greatly reduce deaths by helping users assess purity. Furthermore access to cleaner drugs either through decriminalization or legalization or similar initiatives would greatly reduce harm here.

Some may argue that fatalities are not the primary problem ""caused by"" drugs. That addiction, psychosis or other personal and social issues are aggravated by illegal drugs.

I believe that these ""drug related harms"" are mostly poverty related. Rich people use drugs at comparable levels to poor people but have the resources to access purer drugs and rehabilitation. We occasionally see reports of celebrity overdoses and abuse ""ruining lives"" but the most common cause of death in these cases is largely driven by alcohol abuse, and not because they aren't using or don't have access to other drugs.

Drugs in general are not illegal due to public safety concerns. This is evidenced by various dangerous substances being entirely unregulated. For example while Psilocybin containing ""magic mushrooms"" are tightly regulated globally, no such regulation generally exists for Amanita Muscaria (Toadstool mushrooms) which can also cause inebriation, despite Amanita being an order of magnitude more dangerous. In fact the harvest and sale of any kind of lethal poisonous mushroom is completely legal in most of the world, so long as it is not intended for consumption, it would be legal to grow death cap mushrooms but not psilocybin.

Lastly some may argue that drug abuse is bad for you and rather than regulating substances similarly to alcohol, in an ideal world we would not even be abusing alcohol, I disagree with this sentiment. Alcohol may cause grave social harms but we greatly mitigate them with policies and education about alcohol use. Countries that permit legal access to alcohol generally outperform countries where alcohol use is illegal, on human rights indices. We can permit access to alcohol for recreational use with limitations on access based on age, but also other social reforms like in Norway and Sweden where alcohol purchase is highly regulated and you cannot purchase alcohol from a regular supermarket (these countries have lower alcohol related deaths than the European average).

I'm interested in having this view challenged/changed because I am frustrated that millions are spent policing drugs when I believe that the problems attributed them could be better solved in different ways. I would like to understand the arguments for status quo drug regulation and why people believe them.",Schizotaipei,17,55,0.7200000286102295,0.10784471649484537,1759399435,/r/changemyview/comments/1nvzo9u/cmv_the_vast_majority_of_problems_caused_by/,2025,10
1nw854d,"CMV: ""Release the Epstein files!"" Has turned into a pointless meme much like ""Dark Brandon"" leading up to the 2024 election","Of course I want accountability but I have little faith that any will be had. The mantra about releasing the files is completely impotent whenever it comes to the Trump administration changing course. There may be a wee bit of boycotting and canceling of others that were found in the files, but the saga of Epstein and his associates and those that he funneled young girls too will not turn around the fascist track that we are on. 

Trump has recently met with high ranking military personnel and plans to have an all-out war with those that did not support him in his reelection. He's trying to cut funding for 16 states that voted against his presidency. He secured 160 billion dollars for ICE several months ago. He's consolidating state power at a rapid unconstitutional rate. The supreme Court has no interest in following the Constitution or hampering his agenda. 

The Democrats don't have a plan on how to save the country from this fascist takeover. Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have turned into jello and won't even endorse a mayoral candidate from their home state. They have shifted their messaging about identity politics and marginalized groups to discussions about the Epstein files. 

Most importantly - everyone has known that Donald Trump is a pedophile for many years now. His interactions with his daughter, The comment that he made about the child on the escalator that everyone has seen, The young girls that were trafficked out of Mar-A-Lago, The vast amount of times that he has been accused of rape, The depositions and court filings where he was accused of raping a 14-year-old girl, his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, The birthday book, The Howard Stern interviews where he talked about minors, his disgusting discussion of pageants and his behavior at them, these have all been known about for many years... And he had the FBI comb through the Epstein files and find all mentions of him, foreseeably getting him out of any trouble that he would have been in. 

I'm sure there will be responses where people try to act as though I'm being insensitive to the victims and don't care about justice. That's not true. My view is that repeating the mantra about the Epstein files hoping that it will do something political is absolutely foolish like repeating Dark Brandon in the lead up to the election before Kamala Harris was involved. It's a theatrical presentation that has been formulated as a way for the democratic party to get out of having to create policy that goes against their donors.  The fascist takeover is going to happen with or without the release of the Epstein files. It should be pretty obvious to anybody and their grandma after seeing Kash Patel do his MAGA tapdance in front of Congress a week ago. Any Justice that comes from the files will purely be social through boycotting and cancel culture. Repeating the mantra about releasing the files every chance that you get on Reddit isn't going to change that.

1nvpu9q,CMV: Modern Therapy Will Be Viewed as a Mistake in 50 Years,"We talk about modern therapy as if it’s a perfect science, but the evidence is shockingly weak once you strip away the marketing. Most results are small-to-moderate, short-term, and based on self-report, not long-term life outcomes. Imagine if physics or medicine worked on data that flimsy — it would be laughed out of the room.

Therapy is imperfect, probabilistic, and often run like a lifetime subscription model instead of a skill-building intervention. It’s rarely tailored to the individual, even though patient profiles (IQ, temperament, trauma history, etc.) obviously matter. Meanwhile, the iatrogenic effects are real: people leaving therapy more fragile, over-identified with pathology, or reliant on their therapist instead of resilient on their own.

And here’s the kicker: people say it “works” because they feel better right after a session. But heroin would score the same way if you measured it at 30 minutes post-dose. We almost never check what really matters: one year later, are they happier, more functional, more productive, and better connected to the people around them?

Future therapy will shift toward precision, measurement, lifestyle integration, and accountability. But right now, it looks more like a cultural religion than a hard science.

(Disclaimer) I used AI to help organize my thoughts for this, I like the way it writes, I don't care sue me. Also, I made it overly insensitive to drive attention I actually want to discuss this in a nuanced way and don't want to fully condemn therapy I know it works for some people, I just think it's nearly as effective or polished as most average people think it is.",Top_Government8275,0,64,0.46000000834465027,0.1,1759366313,/r/changemyview/comments/1nvpu9q/cmv_modern_therapy_will_be_viewed_as_a_mistake_in/,2025,10
1nvw568,CMV: Trump is NOT stupid/an idiot,"I often come across the claim that Trump is stupid, slow, a moron, etc.

I don’t believe this. On the contrary, I believe he is EXTREMELY intelligent. 

Let’s look at the man’s track record. 

Scandal after scandal, legal issues, criminal conduct - a man like this shouldn’t be anywhere near the White House. 

And yet, the results speak for themselves. Not only was he elected once, he was elected TWICE. We gave this megalomaniac the keys to the highest office in the land TWICE. 

It was unfortunate his opponent in 2024 was a POC and a woman. In my view, America is still too backward to elect a woman. The fact Kamala is also a POC was a double whammy that current America could not see past. 

Trump does not need everyone in America to agree with him. He just needs his radical support base, who have always been there (the “conservatives”) and as long as he has their support he will always be safe. 

Bear in mind this is a man who lived in NYC all his life, leaned left on almost every issue, ran as a democrat in the past etc. He used the republic party as his vessel to gain power. He knows how to manipulate people. He knows what he’s doing. 

Anyone that has achieved as much is, by definition, not stupid. He’s a horrible man, but you can’t deny his achievements, as much as I hate to say it. ",sjr323,0,58,0.3499999940395355,0.090625,1759385965,/r/changemyview/comments/1nvw568/cmv_trump_is_not_stupidan_idiot/,2025,10
1nwb7nj,"CMV: Most of the ""bad"" done by lolcows is caused by the community, not because they're ""bad people""","Tagging as NSFW because there's going to be some topics that are likely to be brought up that are rough. 

The biggest example I can think of is Chris Chan, the original. 

She started out as a kid with difficulties, not the best home life, autism, and who knows what else? She said a lot of hateful rhetoric, but it seems to me it was mostly just things she heard repeated and that there was no bad intent in most of it. Her life started getting infinitely worse once the Idea Guys got involved, and arguably, pushed her past redemption. If her comics had stayed small, her YouTube never blew up, there's a good chance she wouldn't have ended up on the path she did. Even the most recent, the biggest incident - it was all encouraged and pushed by her ""fans""/ friends. 

Once these folks go viral, they lose the ability to just live a normal life ever again. Look at King Cobra's dad (RIP homeboy Josh) - Clint almost died because people kept fucking with his car. When he goes to work, he has to mention to not look up his son. 

I won't say that it's all the fans/anti-fans/ whatever they're called, and that people can make their own decisions, but a lot of these folks have so much ripped out of their hands, and when they start so young and start being watched from the start, it's almost grooming for failure. 

I think if someone, especially someone vulnerable for whatever reason, is thrust into fame, especially negative fame, there has to be acknowledgement that people do push them to do a lot of bad things.

1nw4uww,CMV: Speedbumps are environmentally unfriendly,"Speedbumps are designed to improve safety by slowing vehicles down, but their side effect is that they harm the environment.  
Vehicles crossing over speedbumps have to decelerate and then accelerate, leading to increased emissions. As a whole we should be moving towards reducing CO2 emissions.

The speedbumps also wear down brakes, tires, suspension - generating more particulates into the environment, not to mention increasing the necessity of servicing. It also increases noise pollution, with cars braking and then accelerating. That's not even mentioning their installation and maintenance costs.

There are other alternatives that could be used, but are rarely implemented, like single lane slow down points.

1nw94nx,CMV: I am a panpsychist,"I don’t really know what a panpsychist is but people call me that so I guess I am one. I think all my positions are just the only logical conclusion you can make about the world based on the fewest assumptions. 

All we know for certainty is that we exist in the sense that you reading this now know you feel emotions and thoughts, you don’t know if I feel emotions or thoughts or are just pretending to have them or just a hallucination of your mind. So from that we can say I am the only thing in the universe or you can say because there is me there are probably more. 

I agree with the idea that I’m not the only thinking thing in the universe, but then there is the question of what thinks? What causes me to think or how does my consciousness affect the world physically. 

I am me ofcourse but even my consciousness can be split in half literally by cutting my brain into two pieces or simply peeling back of the layers of perception through drugs or meditation. Conscious to me seems to be like taking transparent paper and laying one piece ontop of the other until you get a coherent image but all of these drawings are in themselves pieces of drawings or consciousness themselves so it seems that consciousness is divisible. If that’s the case what is the small conscious unit? Two neurons one neuron? And what about the neuron itself makes it conscious what it too is just a jumble of atoms like any other cell in the body or rock in the universe? Well the tempting answer is the ability to do logic but logic can be preformed by any object especially sense it doesn’t need to be correct logic. Ie if you look at a rock and it hasn’t cracked you can deduce it hasn’t been struck yet and if it has been struck it will break it stores information and transforms itself when provided input being “struck”. So if consciousness is logic and logic can be preformed by anything how do you not conclude that everything is conscious? That there isn’t just consciousness in a rock but a conscious between two people talking (exchanging data) and even societies and eventually the universe itself. And what we experience is just a small portion of that consciousness but other things experience either our consciousness and others or a conscious in communication between other consciousness. I just don’t see how you escape this way of thinking without introducing artificial limitations like only living cells at a certain mass produce consciousness. I just want to know what other people think creates consensus or can make my messy understanding of sorts this hive mind conciseness more coherent because I’ve tried figuring it out on my own and I’m stuck.

1nwde02,CMV: Today’s world order is the continuation of Germanic and Anglo hegemony,"I’d like to share some of my beliefs about history, identity, and geopolitics. I realize these views are controversial, and I don’t claim to have the full picture. I’m posting here because I want to read strong counterpoints. If you disagree, please explain where you think my reasoning goes wrong or what evidence contradicts these perspectives.

1) I see the West as essentially the Germanic world.

2) After the Second World War, the global order shifted toward an Anglo-led Western hegemony, where Anglo-Saxon powers expected the rest of the world to submit.

3) European identity, after the barbarian invasions, was initially limited to Latinized Germanic dynasties and later extended to converted Germanic and non-Germanic peoples.

4) The Crusades in Northern Europe, West Asia, and North Africa were not only religious conflicts but also part of wider Germanic expansion.

5) Lebanon and Israel today can be understood as a modern version of Outremer, the Crusader states.

6) Without the rise of National Socialist Germany, much of the world would likely still be under Anglo-Saxon colonization.

7) I see Zionism as a Germanic-inspired ideology, rooted in European traditions of settlement and expansion. In my view, it draws on historical precedents like the Ostsiedlung and Drang nach Osten in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Anglo-Saxon Manifest Destiny in North America.

8) Islam in West Asia and North Africa is undergoing a forced reformation under secular governments, reshaped to align with Western political frameworks.

9) In the modern order, any state, organization, or individual that challenges the West tends to be labeled a terrorist.

10) The Islam practiced in Western countries has been liberalized and stripped of its traditional authority, reshaped into a version that fits Western norms and expectations.",Kurgan_Ghoul,0,43,0.3499999940395355,0.0671875,1759433282,/r/changemyview/comments/1nwde02/cmv_todays_world_order_is_the_continuation_of/,2025,10

1nwdb0i,Cmv: A prophet will come after jesus,"What you say ?


1. The Prophecy of the Prophet Similar to Moses

“The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among you, from your brothers; you shall listen to him”
(Deuteronomy 18:18).
 Moses is speaking of a coming prophet:

• “From your brothers” = not from the Israelites themselves, but from their brothers (the Arabs, descendants of Ishmael).
• “Like me” = like Moses: he has a law, leads a nation, fights… (This applies more to Muhammad ﷺ).

2. A Prophecy in Isaiah

“Behold, my servant whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he shall bring forth justice to the Gentiles”
(Isaiah 42:1-4).
The text speaks of a servant of God who will bring forth justice to the Gentiles (Gentiles = non-Jews). Many Muslim commentators associate this with Muhammad ﷺ.

-

From the New Testament (Gospel and beyond):
1. The Annunciation of the Paraclete (Comforter/Paraclete)

“And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you forever.”
(John 16:14)
“But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father—he will testify about me.”
(John 15:26)

The word ""Comforter"" or ""Paraclete"" is Greek (Parakletos). Muslims believe it was originally ""Periclytos"" meaning ""the Praised One"" (i.e., Muhammad).

2. Reference to a Prophet to Come After Him

""I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. However, when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth""
(John 16:12-13).
Christ clearly states that the message is not complete after him, and that someone will come who will ""guide into all the truth."" Muslims see this as a description of the Messenger ﷺ.

-
1. The Prophecy of Ishmael and His Descendants

“As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I will bless him and make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly. He will beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.”
(Genesis 20:17).
Muslims believe that the “great nation” refers to the nation of Muhammad (peace be upon him).

2. Deuteronomy (A Prophet from among Your Brothers):

“I will raise them up a Prophet like you from among their brothers, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.”
(Deuteronomy 18:18).
 “I will put My words in his mouth” = a reference to a revelation being recited (as in the Quran).

3. Song of Songs 5:16 (this is controversial):
The Hebrew text contains the word “Mahammadim” (Muhammad in Hebrew with an exalted form). Some Muslims see it as an explicit mention of the Prophet ﷺ.



From the New Testament (Gospel)
1. John 14–16 (The Paraclete/Comforter)
I mentioned it to you, but I will add: Christians say it refers to “the Holy Spirit,” while Muslims see it as a reference to a human prophet because his descriptions include:

- “He will teach you all things.”
- “He will convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment.”
- “He will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears, that will he speak” (John 13:16).
This matches the revelation sent down to Muhammad ﷺ.

2. John 1:19–21

The Jews asked John the Baptist, “Are you the Messiah?” He said, “No.”
“Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.”
“Are you the prophet?” He replied, “No.”
Here it is clear that they were waiting for ""the Messiah,"" ""Elijah,"" and ""the Prophet"" - a third great figure other than Christ. Muslims see this as a foretaste of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.

3. Matthew 21:42-43

""The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone... Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation bearing its fruits.""
Muslims see the new ""nation"" as the nation of Islam.

1nvwyn5,CMV: Dual working homes and single working parent homes are in large part to blame for the mental health crisis,"Kids no longer have a soft person to teach them emotional regulation, mirror their emotions and prepare them emotionally for adulthood.

Since both men and women work, women are forced to (in large part) kill off their soft side because the rules of the working world don't allow for softness and emotion.

This leaves kids stunted with essentially having 2 (traditionally speaking) dads, who emphasize achievement, toughness and resilience without leaving space for emotional maturity and acceptance.

It also leaves kids unsupervised in their most formative years exposing them to a lot of things they aren't ready to see/hear which further damages them.

IMPORTANT: This was traditionally the role of the mother, this is not a discussion on whether men or women should stay home, or whether women should work or not. In the beginning of women entering the workforce, it was the job of the grandparents, but they're also unavailable for most in the newer gens. This is simply a discussion on the fact kids have no one soft in their life to teach them any emotional resilience other than repression which usually blows up in their face later in life.

I don't claim the epidemic is caused solely by this issue. But I think it has a disproportionally large impact no one is talking about or researching. Most studies focus on ages 0-3, don't account for extended family involvement and show mixed results, so we essentially don't even have a scientific basis for something so obviously detrimental.

1nvw71w,CMV: People should marry and have children in their 20s instead of waiting until their 30s.,"I’ve heard both sides of this argument and would love to hear what others think.

On one hand, people say your 20s are the best time - biologically you’re more fertile, pregnancies tend to be healthier, and you’ve got the energy to keep up with kids. Plus, if you start early, you might get more freedom later in life once they’re grown.

On the other hand, waiting until your 30s seems practical - by then most people have more financial stability, clearer goals, and a better idea of what they want in a partner. Parenting with a bit more life experience could also be an advantage.

So, which do you think is better - starting a family young, or waiting until later? Why?

1nwj6g1,"CMV: Based on the laws of physics, there is no true randomness","This one's pretty simple. All systems of the universe, including those responsible for human behavior I.E. psychology, biology, chemistry, can be reduced to particles following consistent, absolute laws of physics. If this is the case, once the universe exists in a given shape, the progression of that matter and energy over time should occur in a way completely predictable to anyone who had complete knowledge of that shape. If a person in a total vacuum at the same point in space rolls a die the exact same way, the result will be predictable.

Obviously we as humans will never and can never possess that absolute knowledge, but in theory that means no event in the universe is truly, absolutely, unpredictable -- only unpredictable to us based on the amount of information we have. Die results aren't random, RNG isn't random, the trajectory of any given particle through space isn't random, etc. Randomness is just a shorthand for things we don't/can't understand well enough to predict, like whether a driver is going to run a red light or whether a cosmic ray will hit the earth just in time to flip a bit during someone's Mario speedrun. 

Not a physicist so I personally would probably be most receptive to the idea that I don't know enough about physics to make this claim lol",TheMornal,0,23,0.33000001311302185,0.0359375,1759446848,/r/changemyview/comments/1nwj6g1/cmv_based_on_the_laws_of_physics_there_is_no_true/,2025,10
1nw2hou,"CMV: People wanting ""apocalyptic scenarios"" just want an honourable excuse to not go to work.","Whether you are fired from your job or just taking a vacation, both of them are considered being lazy ways of avoiding labour, despite it being perfectly reasonable imo for them to take a break for their wellbeing.

In terms of what I believe, there is lots of horrible division in the world. I'm fine with my current situation, but others aren't and they make it very vocal that they want a ""big event"".


I believe that, in the real, modern era, nothing substantial has happened for power structures in society and for workers across the globe, people go on and live their lives working until they retire at an increasingly late age, possibly with a chronic condition so that they can't even enjoy their silver years. Is it unfair? Sure. Is there any way to avoid it? No.

But there are people that think you can, and that some absurd situation that will impact everyone on the planet will happen, and that it will get them to somehow avoid working without any of the social and economic consequences. 

I get it, you want to socialize and participate in a collective excitement that brings people together, *you want to feel like a fictional character that has a sense of purpose and action in their life*. 

I'm sorry to tell you this, *you are a real person*, and you will live a boring life, as well as be forgotten a few generations after death.


If you want to leave your job, the only way you can do that is be fired. Some massive event that allows you to spend time being your true self will not come, you will be left frustrated and underwhelmed, that is adulthood, that is reality.


#*However*, for those of you who know this, I thank you for understanding and working around your circumstances to give yourself the best life you can, even with the horrible things happening in the world. Even if things won't change, your wellbeing is detrimental to both yourself and those around you, you are trying and I hope you can find some enjoyment throughout your day to day life.

Thoughts? I want someone to change my view on this, but I see many people in my life feel beaten down trying their hardest to make ends meet and it's very upsetting to watch.

1nwgtt7,CMV: Dogs are more psychologically like humans than cats are,"So. I love most animals. I actually like cats more than dogs, by a little bit. But I can't shake the feeling that those little critters are just more alien in their thought than dogs are. I don't know this for sure though, can you CMV?

Despite spending more time with cats, it is a lot more intuitive for me to understand how a dog is feeling. I might not be as accurate as I think in evaluating dogs, but their behavior *seems* to make a lot more intuitive sense.

A faithful hound will follow you around and lay all over you and loves attention, it is easy to interpret that. My cat likes me a lot too, but she does this weird thing where she hangs out in the same room as me like 90% of the time but often does what in a human would be interpreted as playing hard to get, asking for attention then moving away, then getting more attention when I walk past her again.

Dogs get excited to do stuff with you, or very alert and protective of a house. Cats... will stare at a blank spot on the wall with huge eyes, run through the hall at nine billion miles an hour and then stop suddenly and calmly groom themselves. 

You could change my view either by convincing me dogs are less humanlike in their thoughts than I think, or that cats are more humanlike in their thoughts than I think.",MentionInner4448,0,22,0.3199999928474426,0.034375,1759440972,/r/changemyview/comments/1nwgtt7/cmv_dogs_are_more_psychologically_like_humans/,2025,10
1nwdtm3,CMV: The US is not a two-party system,"The US is not a two-party system. The Republican and Democrat parties in essence are just governing coalitions. Within the two major parties that are various coalitions, which is similar to many multiparty systems. There is MAGA, Moderate Republican, neoconservative, Evangelical Republican under 'Republicans' and Blue Dog Democrat, Liberal AIPAC Democrat, Progressive under 'Democrats' We have multiple parties technically, they are just situated under 2 big tents. In countries with multiple parties, they all typically form coalitions in order to legislate. We just skip that by grouping people into 2 factions from the start and they form the coalitions before the election instead of after. Sanders, Biden, Trump, and Rubio would be in four different parties in a multiparty system. Recently, Americans voted in a MAGA led repubican coalition. Just because Trump leads it doesnt mean other types of republicans are excluded from administration or senate.   
In essence, our coalition building is done before the election with different ""wings"" in each party, the primary effectively works as a vote between different policy options and which party within the coalition should lead a presidency ticket or senate race, then the general works as a referendum between coalitions.   
Thus, the US is not a two party system but more of a two coalition system that constantly changes. If you truly want to choose someone that aligns with your policy always sign up and vote in the next primary.",marshallfarooqi,0,16,0.3700000047683716,0.025,1759434254,/r/changemyview/comments/1nwdtm3/cmv_the_us_is_not_a_twoparty_system/,2025,10
1nw6ht0,CMV: Addicted to Being Right (Across the Aisle),"America once thrived on hard truths. From the sharp exchanges of the Federalist and Anti-Federalist papers to the Kennedy–Nixon debates of the 1960s, our public square invited criticism and confrontation. These contests of ideas weren’t comfortable, but they were productive. Like a lawyer stress-testing a legal argument, criticism exposed weak points, forcing us to refine our reasoning or reformulate our positions. That friction was a form of civic growth. Much of this rested on a shared assumption: that, more often than not, each side believed the other was acting out of a genuine desire to propel the country toward a greater future. The means differed, and the ends were not always perfectly aligned, but there was still a recognition that the other side sought what it thought was best for the nation.

But today, criticism is rarely met with reflection. Instead, it is answered with rebuke, antagonism, patronization, or simply deaf ears. Every side of the political spectrum seems to recoil at the suggestion of fault. Rather than seeing critique as an opportunity, we treat it as an attack. Like an addict avoiding the mirror, America cannot bear to acknowledge its own missteps.

So what, exactly, are we addicted to? Not truth, not progress, but the feeling of *being right*. The need to defend our position at all costs—online, on television, in politics—has replaced the older civic instinct to test, challenge, and strengthen our arguments. In this culture, being wrong has become a moral failing rather than a natural part of learning. And where past debates assumed that all sides sought the good of the country, today’s rhetoric often assumes the opposite: if you do not believe my side is right, then you must want America’s downfall.

This shift is no accident. Over the past thirty years, Americans have grown increasingly isolated and alone—not just in the literal sense of how we engage with community, but even more so in how we encounter ideas. Many approach discussion from within bubbles—whether at home, online, or in the classroom—where their views are rarely challenged. In schools, debate is often stifled in the name of parental rights or religious exemptions; in communities, conversations take place only among those with the same predispositions. In such spaces, people trade the discipline of critical thinking for the comfort of self-assurance, convincing themselves that their view must be correct and that it is the rest of the world that has gone mad. The result is a generation unaccustomed to hearing “you’re wrong.” That silence reinforces ego and fragility. When finally confronted, people do not listen to understand but react to defend. Because if they are not right, then what are they? In their minds, not simply mistaken—but alone and wrong, instead of alone and right.

The irony is that clinging to “rightness” leaves us weaker, not stronger. A society that cannot endure criticism cannot adapt, and one that cannot adapt cannot endure. If America once had the courage to sharpen its ideas against the whetstone of dissent, perhaps the cure for our addiction lies in remembering that criticism is not the enemy of conviction but its greatest ally. Like any recovery, it begins with the humility to admit that we might, in fact, be wrong.",No-Ask8059,1,14,0.6000000238418579,0.02316365979381443,1759417954,/r/changemyview/comments/1nw6ht0/cmv_addicted_to_being_right_across_the_aisle/,2025,10
1nwh1l5,"CMV: “late stage capitalism” is a nonsensical, unfalsifiable buzzword that means nothing","Every time I see someone invoke “late stage capitalism,” I’m struck by how empty the phrase really is. If you ask ten socialists what it means, you’ll get ten different answers. For some, it means corporate monopolies. For others, it’s wage stagnation. For others still, it’s overpriced apartments, overpriced healthcare, or some weird gadget being marketed on Instagram. It’s a moving target that morphs depending on the grievance of the moment. A term so slippery isn’t analysis — it’s hand-waving. Economists do not tend to struggle with this problem: it’s very rare to hear different explanations from economists about what supply and demand is, for example.

The “late stage” part is laughable too. People have been insisting capitalism is in its twilight for a century. And yet, during this supposedly terminal phase, global standards of living have risen dramatically. Poverty rates are down, life expectancy is up, and technological goods that once cost fortunes — computers, phones, microchips, even things like air conditioning — have become cheaper, better, and more accessible. How exactly does that square with the idea that capitalism is collapsing in on itself? The phrase never accounts for these advances, because it’s only trotted out to explain negatives.

That selective blindness is the real issue. If housing prices rise, that’s “late stage capitalism.” If healthcare is expensive, that’s “late stage capitalism.” But if food prices drop, or gas prices drop, or resource prices drop (see the famous Simon Elrich wager), then suddenly that’s not part of the conversation. The term works like a rigged game: blame capitalism when things are bad, ignore capitalism when things are good. That’s not analysis, that’s ideology hiding behind a buzzword.

Worst of all, the phrase is unfalsifiable. It can’t be proven wrong. Everything, no matter how contradictory, is folded into it. It doesn’t clarify anything about economics or history — it just signals that the speaker is angry at “the system” and doesn’t feel like being specific. And because it’s so vague, it ends up being a conversation killer rather than a conversation starter.

So change my view: can anyone give me a clear, rigorous definition of “late stage capitalism” that doesn’t collapse into “things I don’t like about capitalism”?  Are there any actual reasons to think capitalism is “ending”? What real reason do we have to think that the idea of private ownership of the means of production is dying?",grandoctopus64,4,4,0.5600000023841858,0.011404639175257733,1759441486,/r/changemyview/comments/1nwh1l5/cmv_late_stage_capitalism_is_a_nonsensical/,2025,10
1nwhmbl,CMV: The final solution to the Putin problem.,"#**Preface**

With respect to later described actions taken by whomever happens to be occupying the role of US President, it’s my view that this should happen. I’m not trying to predict the future. I’m just laying out a plan. Criticize the actual content of the plan, not the likelihood of it occurring. If you want we can imagine this view is what I would do in an alternate universe where I’m President so you can critique the actual actions I describe instead of the likelihood of me wielding that much power. 

#**Solution**

Trump (or whoever’s president) invites Putin to Alaska again. He says he has a deal he thinks Putin will find very favorable. 

Once Putin and his entourage deplane, all of Putin’s security guys are detained and so is Putin. Zelenskyy and some well equipped Ukrainian troops come out of nowhere. Zelenskyy arrests Putin with handcuffs and places him on a plane headed for the Hague so he can stand trial for his ICC war crime charges related to abductions of Ukrainian children. Where Putin will be imprisoned for life afterward. It doesn’t matter who’s in the ICC and who’s not, we can just do this. 

This arrest of Putin by Zelenskyy would be televised 4k to the whole world with tons of cameras everywhere. 

At the same time, the US would broadcast unencrypted communication signals in the proper electromagnetic frequencies to all Russian troops and Russian high command and all of Russian society generally. We also have the internet. We have our three-letter agency boys ready to call phone numbers in Russian high command and Russian government. We have the US embassy in Russia of course to communicate from too. As well as the Russian embassy in the US. 

The message we send to all Russians is: “The Putin regime is over. Stand down. Go home.” 

It’s going to look like the fall of Assad in Syria. They’re just going to take off their military uniforms and go home. 

The moment after Putin’s arrest and the broadcasting of this signal, dozens of US planes close in on Moscow carrying the best of the US military. Navy seals, Delta force, Marsoc raiders,  green berets, RRC, 24 STS, etc. And other necessary personnel like Men in Black from the deepest bowels of the CIA deep state. We would drop them into Moscow with the goal of taking over the national TV broadcast towers. No blood. 

We would politely ask Russian generals not to shoot down our planes and also say that we are not bombing Russia. But we would have our paratrooper planes escorted by F-35s and F-22s. It’s the balance between self defense but not looking like you’re trying to bomb. 

Once the paratroopers land in Moscow and the national TV broadcast towers are peacefully conceded by Russian authorities in Moscow, it’s over. There’s not even an invasion happening anymore. 

There won’t be global thermonuclear war. Putin is the only one who can authorize a nuclear detonation. Doesn’t matter if anyone else is labeled marshal or vice president. No nuclear detonation is happening without Putin’s consent. 

The Putin regime doesn’t represent an ideology Russians feel strongly about. Russian generals are not some kind of knights who view Putin as some divinely ruling emperor. This is not Imperial Japan, this is not an Islamic suicide bomber group, this is not medieval Italians who just had their Pope kidnapped. 

Nobody in the Russian military is going to commit suicide via nuclear war over their love of Putin. 

“Putinism” is not even a real ideology. If you read the official constitution, laws, and propaganda of the Russian federation, what you find is that Russia is a liberal, free, prosperous, and democratic nation on the European continent. 

Under the Russian propaganda view of Russia, what exactly is the ideological divide at the root of the conflict with NATO? It can’t be communism anymore since they’re not even socialist. It’s such a convoluted narrative that nobody actually believes. This is very different from societies where the leaders exploit deep religious or political convictions. Putin’s regime is arbitrary and will collapse like Assad’s. 

The oligarch class that makes up the military high command and government officials have luxurious lives to lose and generally enjoy being alive. They aren’t 16 year old suicide bombers from Gaza with unimaginable trauma willing to engage in mutually assured destruction. They have children, grandchildren, nephews. Putin’s second grandson was born recently. I’m supposed to believe this oligarch class is willing to drown the world in nuclear hellfire on a moment’s notice? Over what exactly? This isn’t the Eastern Front where soldiers are going to torture and rape and murder civilians in the streets after Moscow falls. 

Once Putin is captured and the signals have been sent out, the Russian oligarch class will be faced with a choice: Launch nukes against the US and destroy everything and everyone you love, as well as the entire world pretty much. Or go home. They’re going home. ",TheLastCoagulant,0,4,0.4000000059604645,0.00625,1759442856,/r/changemyview/comments/1nwhmbl/cmv_the_final_solution_to_the_putin_problem/,2025,10
