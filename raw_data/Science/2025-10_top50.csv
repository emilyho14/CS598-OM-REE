Reddit Submission: [Pre-infection deficiency of vitamin D is associated with increased disease severity and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/sk1owo/preinfection_deficiency_of_vitamin_d_is/)

The article [""Pre-infection 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels and association with severity of COVID-19 illness""](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263069) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331693) from *PLOS One* as of September 8, 2025. After methodological concerns were raised shortly after publication in 2022, the article was recently reassessed by an independent member of the *PLOS One* Editorial Board. They determined that the analyses were inadequate to test the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels at the time of infection and severity of COVID-19 illness.

Since this flaw prevents testing of the hypothesis and calls into question the reported conclusions, the *PLOS One* Editors issued the retraction. Fifteen of the study's eighteen authors disputed the retraction.
