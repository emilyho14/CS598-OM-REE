1dgtcsp,AITA for going to my daughter’s graduation after my son relapsed?,"My (M51) wife (F48) and I have two children: Jake (M23) and Jess (F18). 

Although they had the same upbringing, Jake sadly surrounding himself with the wrong people during his late teenage years and made some bad life decisions. Since he was around 17, he's suffered with substance abuse issues and alcohol dependency. He's been through counselling on more than one occasion, and I've lost count of the amount of times that either my wife or I have had to make personal sacrifices to go and tend to him. He's currently living in a Recovery Housing Program, where we hoped he would see improvements.

This has caused understandable issues for Jess. I've missed hockey games and choir performances because I had to go tend to Jake, as has my wife. We try and make it up to her at the time, but I don't think missing important milestones really makes up for it; it's heartbreaking for me personally. 

Jake has been doing better lately, and he hasn't had any relapses or issues for the past few months. Jess' graduation was the other day, and my wife and I had tickets and couldn't wait. She's off to college, graduating with a great GPA and we're really proud of her. 

However, only a couple of hours before the graduation, we received a call from the staff at Jake's Housing Program, who said that he had a relapse incident and was in a really bad way. My wife was hysterical and immediately started telling me we had to go there and help. I refused. I said that we'd missed enough events in Jess' life, and I wasn't missing her graduation. Although my wife told me how sad she was to miss it, Jake's health and wellbeing would take priority. I wasn't changing my stance. She got increasingly agitated and said she'd go herself, called a cab, and went. I took the car and watched Jess' graduation. It was one of the proudest days of my life, but when I saw Jess at the end, I could tell she was visibly upset that her mom wasn't there. I explained and you could tell her frustration.

My wife made it to our celebratory dinner later, and she apologized, but the mood was sour. The incident with Jake was serious, but not a life threatening emergency, and he has been admitted into treatment. 

My wife gave me the cold shoulder later saying how we should have been on the same page, been there for support, and that I'd been selfish. I disagreed, saying she'd been selfish in this scenario, and she tainted Jess' moment. This went on for a while, and I ended up sleeping on the couch. 

I still feel I made the right decision, but I know I hurt my wife, and Jake's recovery is obviously of paramount importance as well.

1d8acpx,AITA for reminding my friend that she married for intelligence and look where it got her?,"I (35F) met my husband Vince (36M) after he saved me from drowning at a pool party when I was 18. I took him out for lunch the following week to thank him for saving me, and we soon fell in love and began dating. 

At the time, Vince worked a blue collar job while I was studying in university. We ended up getting married and Vince supported me throughout my entire education up until I got my PhD. 

Vince always told me that he wanted to study in university but had learning disabilities that made it difficult for him to study in a classroom. At times he was embarrassed by the fact that he had to work twice as hard compared to people around him, but I always found that to be admirable about him. 

When I finished my studies and got a well paying job I convinced Vince to give his dream of studying another go. 

Last year he was finally accepted into a nursing program at our local university. He is working hard to achieve him dream and I’m incredibly proud of him.

Last week my friend Alba (36F) came to visit with her son so our children could play together. Alba was my roommate during my first year in university, she began dating her husband Leo around the same time I started dating Vince. 

Leo was an obnoxious law student who later on became an even more obnoxious attorney. He was a know it all who prided himself on his intelligence, which for some reason attracted Alba. 

At the time Alba would sometimes tease me that I could do better than Vince, and would offer to set me up with one of Leo’s law school buddies, but I would always refuse and she eventually dropped the subject. 

Alba and Leo are currently going through a nasty divorce that stems from him cheating on her, quite frankly he is dragging her through the mud and is using connections to try and leave her as penniless as possible. 

As we were chatting and catching up Alba began to express concern over the fact that my eldest son (7M) was recently diagnosed with dyslexia, Alba began telling me how she is worried that my son will be academically challenged like his father and what that could entail for his future. Before I could respond she told me how I should have married someone smart while I had the chance so I would have kids like hers. (Albas son is an incredibly bright boy and a straight A student).

I told Alba her advice was unnecessary and reminded her where marrying for intelligence got her, I then proceeded to tell her that I would rather have my son grow up to be an honest, hardworking person like his father than an academically gifted jerk who wasn’t smart enough to know sleeping with his secretary could have consequences on his marriage like her husband. 

Alba was deeply hurt by what I’ve said and stormed out with her son. Some mutual friends are now chiming in and are telling me that
I was too harsh on Alba for using her failing marriage to prove my point and should apologize. ",Throw_awayy098,11411,1018,0.949999988079071,0.7066235171962219,1717540642,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1d8acpx/aita_for_reminding_my_friend_that_she_married_for/,2024,6
1dc607o,AITA for being rude to my stepdaughter and banning her from eating with the family,"I have 2 stepdaughters, Scarlett (18), and Ava (16). 

Scarlett is an amazing singer. She's been in some kind of voice lessons since she was 10 and just graduated from one of the best performing arts schools in the state, where she went on a full scholarship since 6th grade. She has a YouTube channel where she sings that she's starting to make money from and was accepted into some very prestigious music schools. Additionally, she has been working paid gigs for the last 2 years and makes at least $500-1000 per week, more in the summers. She's even been the opening artist at a few concerts. I'm not trying to brag, I'm just saying she's an objectively good singer. 

Ava, on the other hand, is not a good singer. She likes to believe she is and she might become one if she actually stuck with voice lessons or choir classes but she always quits after 1-2 weeks because they're ""bullying her"" (giving constructive feedback, I've seen the notes her classmates and teachers have given her). 

Ava also likes to sing very loudly and/or at bad times. For example, if she feels that we're too quiet at the dinner table she starts to loudly sing. It doesn't sound good and I honestly don't know how she doesn't hear it. If you ask her to stop she keeps going and if you're blunt and say stop, that doesn't sound good/we don't want to hear it she keeps going and gets even louder just to annoy you. 

If we're in the car and we don't let her choose the songs she'll loudly sing whatever she wants, not what's playing, to annoy us and responds the same way to us telling her to stop. The only person she listens to is her dad. 

A few weeks ago we were trying to eat and she was singing again. I told her to stop and she refused so I took her plate and told her from now on she is no longer allowed to eat at my table. She can eat in her room, the backyard, her car, the garage, wherever she wants as long as we can't hear her from the dining room and that this will continue until she can behave appropriately at the table. 

My husband and I argued about it but he's not home for dinner so there isn't much he can do about it. Today she was eating lunch with us and started singing again. I told her to stop and she didn't listen so I again took her plate and told her to eat somewhere where we can't hear her if she doesn't want to act appropriately. Ava argued that she's a better singer than Scarlett and that Scarlett sings all the time. I was done with her bullshit so I asked her how many times someone other than her dad has actually asked her to sing, not even paying her to be there, just ask her to sing or how many performing arts schools she's gotten accepted to (she's applied to many).

She started to cry and my husband wants me to apologize for being rude to her and is insisting I allow her to eat with the family again.

1dsdhlx,AITA for not paying for my daughter's college housing and campus fees next year because she misled me about her summer classes?,"My (55M) daughter (19F) is taking three online summer classes this summer. Back in April, she told me that all her classes would be in-person, so I paid for her summer housing and meal plan so she could live on campus. I didn't think much of it at the time because I trusted her. Two of them are general education classes (English and physics), and one is a major-specific class, so I figured that she would want to get her generation requirements out of the way and I'm sure the major-specific class is important for her major.

However, I just found out that her classes are actually all online. There is a 3rd-party website that has information about classes each semester at her college, and I was just scrolling through it out of curiosity and happened to see her classes are all online, with no in-person component. I was very shocked about how I was misled for the last 2 or 3 months. I know that she really likes campus life, but things do tend to tone down over the summer, and she probably is aware of the campus housing fees and whatnot. This means I spent a good amount of money for housing and meal plans that she didn't actually need. I'm paying for her education out of her college savings, which we've been saving for many years, and I want to teach her the value of money and the importance of honesty.

I was on the phone with her, and I told her I decided that I'm not paying for her housing or any of her campus fees next year. I emphasized that she needs to understand that there are consequences to her actions. However, she is really upset and says that I'm being too harsh. She says that in April the classes were listed as in-person but they moved it to virtual at the very last minute, after the deadline for housing withdrawal and refund stuff. I don't know if this is actually true since I never bothered to check the class listings at that time and I didn't see a reason she would lie about it. I told her I'm very skeptical that they would move all classes to online at the very last minute because it would certainly disrupt some people's plans (especially those who lease off-campus). My wife said that what I told her was way too harsh, and that unexpected things do happen.

So AITA for not paying for my daughter's college housing and campus fees next year because she misled me about her summer classes?",RangerRemarkable3,3468,2128,0.8700000047683716,0.5855977138385793,1719786753,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dsdhlx/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_daughters_college/,2024,6
1drm1oo,AITA for not attending my best friend's wedding?,"My friend [27/f] asked me [28/f] to be one of her bridesmaids for her wedding. She was my maid of honor two years ago, and before that, we'd always say we'd be each other's maid of honor (we've been friends for 20 years). When she asked me to be a bridesmaid, it stung a bit, to be honest, but seeing as she has a twin sister that she is close to, it made sense that she should be her maid of honor.

The issue I really had with this is that at one point, before I did barely anything as a bridesmaid, she told me, ""You don't have to stand with the other bridesmaid's during the wedding.""  I found it weird that she was saying that, but I replied, ""no, I want to be there with all of you"". After a bit of back and forth, she admitted she doesn't want me standing there with everyone because of my fear of being the center of attention and my social anxiety.

She was worried that I would have a panic attack just like I did standing there at my own wedding. Honestly, it was bad during my wedding because I was shaking and couldn't breathe, and everyone's terrified reaction made it even worse for me. I had to leave and come back to just me, my husband, and my mother to continue our vows and such while everyone else moved on to the reception. I couldn't even go join them until I was drunk enough to not feel embarrassed.

I've been to therapy since then and have made huge progress regarding my social anxiety and my best friend knows this. I felt hurt that she didn't trust me enough to let me stand with the others. I told her I was so much calmer and less anxious now, and I won't even be the center of attention like I was when I was the bride. She said she acknowledged my improvement but just doesn't want to take chances.

She said she doesn't want to embarrass me again and that she would just feel worried about me the whole time, and was also worried that I would ruin the mood of the wedding if I did happen to have a panic attack. I eventually told her that I'd just rather be a guest if I can't do all the bridesmaid stuff. On the day of her wedding, I was just so sick to my stomach with hurt and sadness that I was merely going as a guest to her wedding that I just decided not to go because I felt so left out.

Now she is very mad at me for making her feel bad at her wedding. She thinks I was trying to hurt her and make her feel guilty because of what she thinks was a reasonable request. I didn't mean to hurt her but I just couldn't go because I was overwhelmed with hurt. The people I've talked to are all divided on who is the asshole in this situation. I feel bad for ruining her mood on her wedding day but I still feel what she asked of me was hurtful. AITA in this situation?",Alternativebe1,5395,1453,0.8600000143051147,0.532228567201009,1719698008,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1drm1oo/aita_for_not_attending_my_best_friends_wedding/,2024,6
1dfcvs2,AITA for refusing to accept my mom’s friend’s MacBook after her autistic son broke mine and asking her to buy me a new one?,"I (16F) got a brand new MacBook Pro for my birthday last month. My family isn’t rich and I don’t usually get gifts like that. My parents said they got me that because I’ve been doing great at school and they thought I deserved something nice after using an old Chromebook for years. 

A few days ago, my mom’s friend came over with her kids (14F and 10M). We were in my room and me and the girl were sitting on my bed talking while the boy was on the floor playing with some Legos (he is autistic). He walked over to my desk, opened my laptop, and told me to give him the password so he could play Roblox. I told him he can’t play on my computer and he started crying and saying it’s not fair and he’s bored. I told him to go get his mom’s phone if he’s bored and he said he wants to play on my laptop. When I said no again, he threw it on the floor and stomped on it.

I went outside and told my mom. His mom apologized and said she would pay for the repairs. I told her that I don’t think it’s repairable because it’s completely smashed. He threw it open with the screen facing down. The thing that connects the screen to the keyboard snapped, the screen was filled with cracks, and it was dented all over. We took it to a repair shop and they told us that it can’t be fixed and we should just buy a new one instead.

My mom called her friend and told her that. She came over with her MacBook and said I could have that instead. I told her that I don’t want her 5 year old MacBook Air, I want her to give me $1800. My mom is on my side and she is going to give us the money, but she’s not happy about it. She said she was planning to buy her daughter a laptop because she’s going to high school and her son a PS5 for his birthday and she won’t be able to do that because I was greedy. I don’t care that her brat isn’t getting a PS5 but I kinda feel bad for her daughter because this wasn’t her fault. She’s been telling all of her and my mom’s other friends that I’m a spoiled brat and this wouldn’t  have happened if I’d let her precious baby boy play Roblox or given him my phone.

1dcybn6,AITA for inviting my mom to stay at our house when my wife hates her? ,"My wife(43F) hates my mom(67F) and visa versa mainly because my mom criticizes her for being a bad wife. My wife is a OBGYN and so I do most of the housework. I am a senior data analyst and work from home 3 days a week so I get the kids ready for school while my wife heads to the gym. As soon as we had kids my mom began critiquing my wife’s “laziness”. My wife working 60-70h a week and I work 40h and we can’t have the lifestyle we do without her income which I have explained repeatedly to my mom. But my mom is pretty old fashioned and conservative on these things and thinks my wife is being a bad wife because I spend more time with the kids and do more of the housework. She is very critical and I understand why my wife had enough even though I repeatedly told my mom to keep her opinions to herself.

My wife blew up at her after she stayed over during the holidays and I was doing all the cooking and cleaning as I had time off and my wife still needed to work. My mom criticized her for being a bad mom for not being there during Christmas and my wife blew up at her and refused to let her stay over. It’s been 5 or 6 years and she is still banned from the house. She has apologized to my wife but my wife ignores any attempts at communication and I’ve given up on them getting along. If my mom wants to see our children I drive them over. This has caused a lot of issues in our marriage. 

She recently had a heart attack which required a stent put in. She was released from the hospital and asked me to stay at our house for a week. She lives alone and I wanted to be there to watch her and agreed without thinking. I asked my wife who refused to let me mom stay saying she is going to driving her back to her home the instant I bring her over. She had a heart attack and I wished my wife would show some sympathy but she also caused the problems between her and my wife so AITA for wanting my mom to stay at our house after surgery to recover?

1daplsa,AITA for hiding my large net worth from my boyfriend of 8 years while he paid for everything?,"Throwaway account.

I (34F) was recently engaged to my boyfriend (37M) of eight years. We've been living together for quite some time, yet we've always kept our finances almost entirely separate. When it came to discussing being married, the idea of a prenup came up. It was then that I came clean about my financial status. My net worth is just barely seven figures, yet he's been the one ""supporting"" the household.

Background: We met months after I returned to my hometown. My father had unexpectedly died, and I'd left a lucrative engineering career (six figures) that had started fresh out of college. Before that career hit, I had been raised to be frugal as hell, and I suffered like crazy through college. No home internet, no phone, no car, working multiple part-time jobs while being a full time student, etc. When money suddenly starting coming in, my lifestyle didn't change THAT much. Being able to afford a dozen more food options and having a $500 car felt like moving up in the world.

So when we met, I had '97 car, a crappy one-bedroom apartment, never went out to eat (including fast food), and was working a minimum wage job. I got the job for the sake of insurance, and I had wanted something extremely flexible in lieu of my father's death. So I imagine I came across as someone living paycheck to paycheck, when I really had quite a chunk of change in the bank.

As our relationship progressed, we found we had very different styles of living. He liked going out, and I disputed this. We always split the bill down the middle, and I was getting cranky - these outings were his suggestions, and my date ideas were free/cheap. He said he'd pay for both us. Move forward: We moved in together, and I again I disputed. We didn't NEED to rent a large house. It was ultimately decided to get his choice and I'd pay a smaller portion.

Then my mother died. The savings of my frugal parents went to me.

My boyfriend knew I didn't like spending money, and he knew I wasn't in debt. But he still thought his worth was higher, and he was still paying for most of the expenses. 

To clarify: He'd worked up to a six figure job, and I feel he should spend his income as he wants. He spends at will, retains little savings, but he's stayed debt free.

Fast forward. We're engaged, and I tell him how much money I have. He's initially excited at the prospect of being able to buy all these things. I'm scared. My finances will suddenly become ""our"" finances, and his spending ideas are NOT what I want. We discuss this, and now he's mad that he's been mostly supporting me for so long, unnecessarily. I point out that was the lifestyle HE chose, and that he absolutely refused MY suggestions. Still, I benefited.

I say we can use my savings to buy a house, to have solid funds for future children, for earlier retirement, etc. He's growing more resentful.

My net worth was a lie of omission. I never told him I couldn't afford things.

1diame9,AITA for not putting my MIL’s Maiden name in my child’s name. ,"My fiancé (24m) and I (24f) are expecting our first child in December of this year. We don’t know the gender yet so we were picking names for both a boy and a girl. We’ve fallen in love with names already. My fiancé has his father’s last name, and that name is on his birth certificate. While his mother has a completely different last name. She has been hellbent on getting us to make the last name of our child her maiden name which neither of us have. So in my head it just doesn’t make sense. She has been very manipulative in the past with various things to the point where we have given in to just get her to leave us alone about things. This time around she proceeded to guilt trip us on why we won’t give the child her last name. She proceeded to throw the “I raised you he didn’t” card and even said she was going to go to the court to change my fiancés last name which I found hilarious seeing he’s a grown adult. Now mind you MIL has 4 sons, two of which have her maiden name as her last name and all four children are straight and have potential to bare children of their own in the future. Im trying to convince my fiancé not to give in to even hyphenating her last name and keeping it just his current last name to help set early boundaries on raising this child. But MIL has it so deep in his mind that he has to please her and that she’s entitled to make these decisions because she raised him. Not to mention she had demanded to be at my gender ultrasound instead of waiting for the reveal we have planned at our baby shower. So I’m just curious if ITA because I want our child to have his or her father’s last name and not their grandmothers. 

UPDATE: My fiancé and I have talked and we have agreed to give the baby his last name as I will be marrying him and taking the last name anyway. Boundaries will be HEAVILY set with MIL and appointments will be kept private between the two of us. I thank all of you who have validated my feelings and who have given advice as this all has helped make us realize and make him realize that this is a creepy power control thing on her end. We only want the best for baby and we need to lay the law now or it will never happen.

1drmdgb,AITA for telling my friend that she is making her fiancé miserable.,"I (21F) recently got into a pretty heated argument with my friend (22F) regarding her engagement to her fiancé (30M). 
For some background info, me and my friend (Carrie) have been on and off friends since middle school, but over the last 3 years, have become really close and I would consider her a best friend. I love her, but she is definitely one to be dramatic and overreactive. I’ve always thought that, but it has been overwhelmingly hard to handle for the past year. 
About a year into her relationship with her fiancé (Shawn) she started to obsess over the idea of getting engaged. She would constantly ask friends and family if Shawn had mentioned wanting to propose, would go through his bags during every trip they took to see if he had a ring hidden somewhere, and would sob to Shawn and anyone who would listen after any major holiday or event, wondering why he wouldn’t propose because it was the “perfect opportunity”. 
During a night out with Shawn, Carrie, and one of his friends, Carrie texted me begging for me to talk to Shawn privately about when he was going to propose. Knowing she wouldn’t drop it, I texted Shawn and said at some point that night, I would need to talk to him. Eventually, I got him alone and explained that he didn’t need to tell me anything, but that Carrie wanted me to ask about thoughts on engagement. He told me that he’s gotten to the point where he is going to propose to make her happy and that it will be about two months from when our convo took place.
 Now, they are engaged, but the issues have not gone away. Now Carrie is obsessed with wedding planning and Shawn has shared with me that he feels overwhelmed by her even more so now. Shawn isn’t allowed to go out for drinks once a week after work or play videos games like he usually does because of the wedding. 
Yesterday, I was over at their shared place because Shawn was golfing and Carrie didn’t want to be alone. At one point, she looked at his location, then pulled up a map of the golf course online and asked me to help her figure out what hole he was on. I told her it looked like he was on hole eight, which upset her because he had already been golfing for awhile and she assumed he would be close to done. She proceeded to call him 32 times in a row until he answered, and then sobbed when he picked up and told him he needed to come home now, because he had been out for too long. After their argument over the phone, I couldn’t stop myself from the comment I made which was: don’t you think you’re making Shawn a little miserable? 
This obviously didn’t go over well, she sobbed and yelled at me, saying I just didn’t understand how much she loves him. 
I left and we haven’t talked in a couple days. I regret what I said, but I don’t necessarily think I’m wrong. My overall concern is that I have definitely become too involved in their relationship, I have definitely become the middle man.

1dhishx,AITA for messing with in-laws when they pretended my vacation house was theirs?,"I (45M) bought land out west for a future vacation house years ago.  When my now-wife (37F) and I were engaged, I finally got around to having it built.  I paid for it myself and it is my name only (wife’s fine with this).  My MIL has always been a bit weird about it. She grew up in a family that had a “compound” (long gone) and when I started building she was excited about how “we would have a family compound again.”  It was odd, but I let it slide.  She and my FIL also would often more “tell” my wife (not me) that they would be staying there on certain dates, rather than asking.  We usually don’t have people stay there without us – if we wanted that, well, houses in the area Airbnb for $10K/wk. 

Recently they were staying there for a week.  We have a homewatch guy who comes after we leave to make sure water’s off, it’s all locked up, etc, and checks periodically when vacant. He showed up 2 days after ILs were to have left  and called us to say he found a couple there who said they were visiting the owners (whom they identified as ILs) and had asked to stay on four days after they left.  My wife recognized the name (“the Smiths”) as friends of her parents, nice people, and this wasn’t their fault, so we called them and told them the situation but let them stay the extra days.

Here’s where I might be the AH.  I decided to mess with the ILs.  I called them and that well-pump system had thrown an error code (said (our house is very internet-connected so it can be managed from afar).  Could one of them go to pipe room and FaceTime me so I could walk them through reset?  My MIL stammered and said that they had gone to town for the day and couldn’t; and that water seemed fine that morning so could we just have a tech come in a few days?  I said its hard to get techs out there and the caretaker is away, but I could wait ‘til they get back in the evening.  I also said, it’s weird that you’re in town, but I am getting alerts that the garage door has been opened and closed several times during the day – maybe I should have a neighbor check it out?   “No, don’t, we’ll be back!” I then told “the Smiths” that my ILs were banned and if they showed up they should have them call me to explain.  The ILs drove 4 hours to get back to the house to cover up what had gone on.  They called us and I told them that we knew they had been representing the house as their own, giving it to their friends and they were banned.  They protested that they’d have to get a hotel or drive 4 hours back, and I said I didn’t give a shit, so long as they got off my property immediately. They whined about how they had made plans later in the summer.  I told them they could tell whatever friends they had lied to about having a vacation place the truth or some other outlandish lie, but they weren’t coming.   My wife then posted on social media (where she is connected with many of ILs friends) that the house is mine and any invitations extended were not authorized.  ILs called us jerks.",PrizeNegotiation5637,5006,305,0.9700000286102295,0.28112179277267413,1718576040,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dhishx/aita_for_messing_with_inlaws_when_they_pretended/,2024,6
1d7he1t,AITA for refusing to wear the bridesmaid dress?,"My (25F) best friend (24F) Rainn is getting married in a few months. I’m really happy for her, but I’m having a major issue with the bridesmaid dresses.

The dress itself isn’t hideous, it’s just . . . unflattering. It’s a bright neon green, which wouldn't normally be a deal breaker, but it’s a halter top with a super low back.  Now, I’m all for embracing my body, but I have pretty bad scoliosis and a prominent scar on my back from a childhood surgery. The low back would definitely show off both, and I’m not comfortable with that.

I talked to Rainn about it, suggesting maybe a shawl or finding a dress with a higher back. She shut me down completely. She said the dresses are “non-negotiable” and that “it’s her day.” I understand wanting everything to look perfect for her wedding, but I don’t feel comfortable feeling so exposed on such a big day.

I floated the idea of just opting out of being a bridesmaid altogether. Rainn got really upset and said it would be a huge betrayal. Now I feel stuck. I don’t want to be a bad friend, but I also don’t want to wear a dress that makes me feel self-conscious.

1dc6enl,AITA for not taking back pajamas my bf’s girl best friend wore?,"The past weekend my bf and I joined his friends for a weekend getaway at a cabin (Airbnb). There were five people in total (me, him, a male friend, his gf, and my bf's girl best friend). 

I've never liked his girl best friend because she gives pick me vibes and I think she either has a crush on my bf or she likes attention. She doesn't like me either. I remain very cordial to her. 

When we arrived at the cabin, she told my bf that she hadn't packed any pajamas and none of her clothes were appropriate since they'd get dirty. 

She couldn't wear the other girl's clothes because they wouldn't fit so she begged my bf to give me my pajamas since I always pack extra. Without asking me he gave her my pajamas.

So I came out of the shower to find her wearing my pajamas and with the bottom basically shoved all way up her crack. She spent the entire weekend lounging in my pjs. 

When the weekend was over she tried to give them back to me and I said that she could keep them. She got mad at me and asked if I thought she was dirty or had cooties. I said she could just keep them since it seemed she liked them a lot. She called me a mean girl and said I was being rude.

It ruined the mood since the other friend took her side while his girlfriend took mine and my bf had to take my side. And now things are really awkward and I think I might be iced out by my bf's friends. AITA?

Edit: He did not know I do not like her. I was annoyed at him for not asking but I always pack extra and never fussed about lending clothes to other people because I believe in hospitality. I would have offered her the pajamas. He immediately apologized and even bought me new pajamas. I have no problem with my bf because he thought he was doing the right thing and he acknowledged his mistake and rectified it.

1dkoexw,AITA for asking my friend not to speak to me about a shared hobby after he found my “white whale?”,"I (31F) and my friend (30M) share a mutual hobby, comics. 

For context, he got into collecting them himself about four months ago after finding out just how intense I was about it. To be honest, it *is* the one thing we’ve really connected on, and while we do share other interests outside of this, nothing else really came close as far as quality time and mutual enjoyment goes. Traveling long distances just to look at Facebook marketplace posts, spending weekends hitting up yard sales, old book stores, flea markets, random shops, etc.

There’s a very specific run that I’ve been obsessed with since I was a kid, and one issue left that would complete my set that I’ve been working on for over 15 years now. I also have all of the figures, etc. that I know of that were released alongside it.

It’s the last thing I need and I’ve always been on the lookout for it - there are a couple available online, but priced above $5k, which I can’t afford. He knows all about this one as I rant and rave about it constantly. I have a tiny photo of it in a locket I wear as a joke, lol.

Last week, he found one in a shop for $2. He came up behind me, saw it before I did, and picked it up without saying anything. I didn’t realize what it was until he pulled it out of the bag later in the car, and showed me, saying how cool it was he found it so cheap and how he was going to get it graded and buy a case, etc.

If I said I was happy for him, I’d be lying. I’m so goddamn jealous, I cried about it for two days straight. I keep thinking things like, “If only I’d looked at the rack from top to bottom rather than bottom to top, I would have found it first.” TBH it makes me sick to think about, that I was so close and lost out to someone who, frankly, I feel like it isn’t as important to - Though now he says it’s going to be the start of his own collection for that run. “Now that I have this one, I may as well get the rest,” were his words.

I can fully admit I haven’t been able to let it go. He kept trying to talk to me about it, asking where I found all of mine, etc. I told him 
I understand he saw it first, bought it, and that he can do what he wants with it, but I was going to need time to get over my feelings - I just missed out on the object to my obsession to someone I myself introduced to the hobby, who previously didn’t particularly care for that specific run.

I asked him not to talk to me about it, and said I didn’t feel like going out and hunting with him for a while. He emphasized that now we can focus on finding myself one, but that’s the first I’ve seen outside of a glass case in nearly two decades. Plus, I just don’t want to go with him specifically, at least until I feel better.

He says I’m putting a strain on our friendship and sabotaging my own weekends (I’m refusing to go out and look for comics - I feel unmotivated) because I can’t be an adult about the situation. I feel like what he did wasn’t “wrong” but that I have a right to distance myself and handle my feelings if I need to.

I went to a chipotle style restaurant thats local to my area.  I ordered my food, got it, and was going to leave when I noticed a couple that had a dog with them.  It just wasn't with them, it was on the furniture.  This shit annoys me, its indoors at a restaurant which isn't allowed. While I'm not allergic, but my mom and brother have severe pet allergies.  

So I took a picture.  I didn't say anything to them, I just took the picture.    I wanted to submit a health code violation to my county and use the picture as proof.  I wasn't going to use it for any other purpose than to submit and document a violation.  

They noticed me and asked why I was taking their picture. I told them.  They said they didn't want their picture used for that.  I told them they should have thought about that before .  They asked me to delete the picture.  I refused.  They called me an asshole.  I go to leave and one of them follows me out and says I violated their privacy.

1dsed83,AITA for telling my guy friends that a girl can reject someone publicly,"Firstly Good day to you i hope ur having a great day/night anyways,

Recently at my school a girl got one of those promposals with the flower and the cardboard and everything and there was quite a crowd it was cite at first but the said SORRY BUT NO and she was super polite about it and as expected people started laughing and chattering and going OHHHH OMGGG stuff like that a huge debate broke out because of this especially with some of my guy friends.

They were blaming her saying after everything he did to plan it she just embarrassed him like that she should’ve said yes and if she wanted to say no so bad she should’ve said it in private… WHAT?

Now this is what i said and some of my guy friends and most if not all my girlfriends agreed with me but some of my guy friends went as far as to say i lacked empathy 
I said if ur going to propose in public be ready to get rejected in public 
I thought it was common sense that you only propose in public if ur sure she’s gonna say yes (i’m talking about like hoco and proms) 
If it’s a crush then it should be in private in case she says no so you can save yourself from embarrassment but some guys were acting like she it’s her duty to save his ass from embarrassment and she was just being rude because she thinks she’s pretty because someone asked her out 

And some guys were saying she should’ve have said yes because of his effort that it’s the thought that counts like so if i say no to someone because i have other plans or i just am mot interested im the person i’m an ahole?

And their acting like he slayed dragons to get flowers to propose to her i could easily get roses and make a cute cardboard and gather my friends to help me if i wanted to make a public proposal but i’m not gonna be like:

I broke off from my group and went to a nearby Cafe to get a cup of coffee. While I was waiting in line, a guy about my age came up to me and asked if he could pay for whatever I was getting.

I told him thanks but there's no need, and he kept insisting that I let him buy me a cup of coffee. I told him again there was really no need, but he didn't relent. I eventually accepted, much to his enthusiasm. We stood in line, he paid for my cup of coffee, and we talked for awhile while I waited for my drink. He eventually asked if he could get my number or if I'd be interested in exploring the rest of the fair together. I apologized and told him that I'm straight, and he got a bit annoyed. 

He scoffed and said ""you could have told me that before I bought you a coffee."" And then walked out of the Cafe.

Was I the asshole here? I kind of feel like it. I sort of figured he was interested in me when he first made the offer, but I didn't want to assume.

1dqvms5,AITA for not eating watermelons my (21m) sister (18f) keeps buying?,"My sister is a big fan of watermelons. In the summer she's been buying watermelons from the grocery store almost every week. She cuts the watermelon and serves it, and she's really into food preparation in general.

However, I'm not a big fan of watermelon. I don't really like the taste of it. When she offers it to me, I politely decline. She says she feels hurt when I don't eat the watermelon she buys and prepares, and she says I'm ungrateful and wasteful.

Our parents agree with her and say that I should just eat the watermelon to avoid wasting food and to support her efforts. I said that I feel pressured into eating the watermelon, and I said that I'm not a fan of watermelon that much. They still insisted that I eat the watermelon, saying that food should not go to waste, I should support and appreciate my sister, and that it has nutritious value. I reiterated that I did not want to eat the watermelon because I do not like it. I pointed out that I like mango and my sister does not, so I asked if she would eat mango that I buy and prepare. She said that she would not because it's kind of sour and has a weird texture, whereas watermelon is the ideal summer fruit because it's sweet and juicy. After a 15 minute argument I still refused to eat the watermelon my sister is offering, and she and my parents became visibly upset.

1dc6dza,AITAH for not paying for my coworkers lunch? ,"This is genuinely the dumbest AITAH I’ve ever made/read, but here we are. I’m a first responder and was riding along with another shift for training purposes. The first day we drove through chic fil a. I ordered a small Mac And cheese, in our area that’s about $4. He ordered a whole meal. When we got to the window, they gave us 50% off making mine $2. The guy I was riding with said “Don’t worry I’ll cover you”. Cool, thank you for covering my $2 I appreciate it lol. Second day we went to a local bistro that’s decently pricey. I ordered a salad that was about $10. His meal totaled out to just over $20. When we went to the register to pay he told them “She’s going to cover mine” while pointing at me. To say I was appalled is an understatement. The cashier looked at me and I calmly stated “No, I will just be covering myself”. The guy I was riding with got mad and started saying he covered me for lunch yesterday so it’s only right that I cover him. I’m not confrontational, but I’m also no punk lol. I calmly stated “$2 does not constitute $22 (or whatever the total was). If you’d like me to give you $2 to cover my small side I ordered yesterday I will absolutely do that. But I will not be paying for your meal” and handed my card to the cashier. He paid for his meal and we went outside where he refused to let me get into the vehicle. He continued to argue and cause a scene in the parking lot. He told me I’m not longer allowed to ride with him, so I called for a supervisor. Once the supervisor arrived he told them that he covered my lunch yesterday and that I refused to extend the same courtesy and that I embarrassed him and caused a scene and he no longer feels comfortable riding with me. I explained my side to the supervisor and apologized because this is literally so ridiculous lol. The supervisor essentially said I was wrong because I should’ve just been respectful and paid for him like he did me. At this point I was pissed and told them this sounds like extortion and that I wasn’t going to be taken advantage of. I told them that $2 is a whole lot different than $22. We’re first responders, we don’t make a lot of money. I continued to say if he wanted me to buy him a drink from the gas station or give him $2 I had absolutely no problem doing so, but I was not going to be bullied into covering his meal because he covered mine. I ended up riding with someone else because obviously riding with him is no longer an option. The person I switched to also said I was wrong and should’ve just paid for his meal. I don’t think I’m wrong here. Had I known the previous day that I would be expected to pay for his expensive meal after paying for my $2 Mac and cheese I would’ve never let him cover me. I feel like since he put me on the spot, me putting him on the spot in return was only fair. I don’t feel like I caused a scene, I wasn’t the one who argued and refused to unlock the doors. But now everyone’s saying that I’m not a team player and I embarrassed him as well as our place of work. Am I wrong here? AITAH?

1ddq9xy,AITA for asking the teacher to tell the autistic kid to stop harassing my daughter?,"Tonight, my 8-year-old daughter was shaking, crying, and refusing to go to sleep because a boy in her class constantly keeps following her around at school during breaks/lunch. This has been going on for months, apparently, progressively getting worse. 

She has told the boy to stop, first softly, and then more assertively, until she was screaming at him to stop, while crying today. He ran to the teacher and told her that my daughter was being mean to him. The teacher had words with my daughter. Which leads us to tonight, when she broke down.

I spoke to the teacher. She tells me that they are aware of the boy's condition, and that he does not pick up social queues. The teacher is telling my daughter to be friends with him and tolerate him. 

My daughter just wants to be left alone.

From the boy's perspective, he probably doesn't think he has done anything wrong. He probably just wants a friend to hang with. I feel for him.

However, in my probably biassed opinion, my 8-year-old daughter should not have to bear the burden of a boy who makes her uncomfortable, constantly following her around.

1dm8tul,AITA for pulling out of my sister’s wedding a year before the event and being mad that she won’t talk to me now,"I (28F), was asked by my (25F) sister to be the MOH for her wedding that was between a year and a half to 2 years out.

Six months ago, I found out that I am pregnant. My husband and I hadn’t really been actively trying but we weren’t using protection because I’ve been told since I was in my teens that I was unlikely to be able to get pregnant, naturally. We are over joyed and our families are, as well! …except for my sister.

A few weeks following my pregnancy announcement, my mom and sister had a conversation about being realistic on if I would be able to take on all the duties of being her MOH while pregnant and later with an infant. My sister later spoke with me and told me that if I could not follow through with the duties of being her MOH - it was okay! They could find something else for me to be involved in, with the wedding. (For context, my sister and FBILs wedding party is so big that they have two best men and two MOHs) I discussed it with my family and husband…but I ultimately decided that it wasn’t fair to my sister or my child to make a promise to fulfill those duties when I would have a 3-4 month old infant and was generally unsure if I could do everything she needed of me. 

The wedding is two towns away, 30+ minutes drive, and I would either have to bring the baby with me for the day of the wedding (What bride and bridesmaids want to listen to a baby all day while they are getting ready?) or I would have to leave the baby with someone else (From around 8am that morning to somewhere between 6-8pm that night)

So I ultimately pulled out of the wedding party, about 12 months before the date. And intend to help with other things.

The problem is…despite my sister giving me the out and me taking the out….she will not speak to me. She hasn’t spoken to me or answered my calls in about 6 months. She showed up to my gender reveal and completely ignored me. She ignores me at family dinners, outtings, etc. My entire family has told her she is in the wrong and needs to get over it…but I understand that it’s her special day. 

But now I’m angry too…because I know that once I have this baby she is going to try to come into my home and act like everything is fine. And I will not allowed that to happen. I have had a difficult pregnancy so far…full of complications and sickness…my sister has been my best friend for years, she was the first person I called when I found out. And she was the one that gave me an out, in the first place.

I needed her too…


Edit: 
- To clear up some confusion, I am still planning on being involved in the wedding to some capacity and attending. Just not as the MOH
- Also, it should be known that this is a CHILD FREE wedding. I did not mention that prior, however I realize now how important that minor detail actually is to you guys.
- She came to ME about stepping away from the MOH position, not the other way round. I still offered to assist in what I can. Her expectations on what she expects from her MOH is beyond just standing beside her on her wedding day. If it were that simple, there probably wouldn’t even be an issue.

1d5xcky,AITA for not allowing my brother to bring a random Grindr hook up as his +1 at my wedding ?,"I (27F) am gonna get married to my fiance (29M) in July. Initially I invited both my brother (23M) and his long term girlfriend of 3 years to our wedding, however my brother broke up with her last month and a couple of days ago he requested me to let him bring another 1+ to my wedding in order to replace his ex that wasn't coming anymore.

I asked him who he was planning to bring and he said that he wanted to bring a guy he met recenly on Grindr with whom he got along great. I told him that I don't want him to bring a random hook up to my wedding cause we're planning for a rather small ceremony with only our families and close friends. The reason I invited my brother's ex was cause she was a long term girlfriend, which obviously isn't the case with this hook up. 

However my brother twisted the truth and started accusing us of being homophobic for previously allowing him to bring a woman as his plus 1 but not a man and even contacted some of my and my fiance's friends that are LGTBQ+ to stir up drama and turn them against us. While some of them believed us we've also had a couple of friends saying they're gonna drop out from our wedding cause of what my brother told them, not to mention that now he started stirring up drama with my family as well.

1drnora,AITA for ruining our family trip over matching outfits?,"**tl;dr** - I think my SILs intentionally left me out of matching family outfits on our trip & got upset; they said it was all in my head. AITA?

I just got back from our annual family trip & created this account to figure out if I am the A\*\*\* because I can't tell anymore.

My husband and I have been together for 15 years, and his family has a history of excluding me and our second kid from events. This year, we went on a 6-day cruise. A neighbor/friend booked the same cruise last minute. I made sure both my SILs knew they were coming.

One SIL (Jane) loves matching outfits, so we picked out swimsuits for the kids and an outfit for the kids to take photos in. I asked if adults were matching and was told no. On the first day, both Jane & my other SIL (Cindy) showed up in matching dresses with their husbands in almost identical outfits. They shrugged it off and said they just forgot to tell me.

The next day was my kid's birthday. At breakfast, my SILs disappeared with our kids and my friend’s kid without a word. When they returned, they dismissed my concerns and left again to eat lunch without us. We joined them later, but it was clear we were not included in their plans. They showed up for our dinner plans in matching outfits again and, again, we did not get the memo.

By the third day, everyone, including my friend, was in coordinated outfits except my family. When I confronted my SILs, they denied everything and blamed me for overthinking and moving to slowly. They said I made everyone miserable and that I was aggressive for expressing my hurt feelings.

The rest of the trip was awkward. I felt excluded and hurt, and now I fear there will be fallout with my MIL and the whole family.

I said sure. He then ate **70 flipping percent** of the food I had made. I seriously had to cook more just so my mom and I could have enough. 

Then last night, I cooked 2 chicken breasts for Zane and my dad (they don't like seafood), and I told them ahead of time they each had 1. Zane ate BOTH chicken breasts. My poor dad had to go get fast food for dinner. Zane said, ""Sorry I ate both. I was just hungry.""

In general, Zane has completely drained our snack supply - even things we bought for ourselves (gluten free/keto friendly snacks). He seriously eats all day long.

I confronted my sister and told her that Zane is a pig and needs to cool it. My mom and dad agree, but my sister is upset with me. AITA?

I have zero clue on whether she's the most hated teacher, the best teacher, most liked teacher, or whatever, but this is about something that happened last weekend. 

School year is way past over, and my SIL lives South, so she drove over. She and my wife were talking about job experiences or whatever, and my SIL brought up some experiences with students; the normal. She said something about student doing x, she did y, student got punishment, next day, SIL acts a certain way toward student. In the ""I'm not finished with yesterday"" type way. She had many examples of this same behavior. And I say ""Honestly, if you can't put one day behind the other, especially when it comes to conflicts with children, teaching probably isn't for you."" 

Eventually when SIL leaves, my wife says that was ""rude,"" but in my opinion, I was saying it how it is.

1dgt4mo,AITA for telling my son it's a good thing he's pretty? ,"My wife and I have four kids. The first two are a welder and a doctor. My middle son just graduated with a degree in Dance. Our youngest is studying  engineering. 

My son is still living at home trying to figure out his future. We were talking about it and he said he wants to move out so he can live how he wants instead of by my insane rules. 

Those rules are 1. Be self supporting after you graduate. 2. Help with chores as long as you live at home. 3. Don't have sex I can hear. 

Those are too much for him. He went to my wife and said that he wanted some help so he could move out. She backed my rules. She also expects him to get a job, help around the house, and not expose us to the orgasms of his partners. Or his own for that matter. 

He came back to me asking how I expected him to make a living. 

We had both talked to him about getting a degree that had more prospects and maybe doing a minor in dance. Our daughter who is a doctor did her undergrad in music. But she also took premed classes and rocked her MCAT. 

He says that he didn't want to do that. He wants me to tell him what to do. I am just kind of lost. So I told him it's a good thing he's pretty. 

All I meant is that he is a tall, athletic, handsome young man. With a degree. He can find an entry level position and work his way up. Many successful people have. 

He took it to mean that I thought he should marry well and be a kept man. 

His other mom and him are pissed at me for undervaluing his potential. I think I was being realistic.

1d6p4jy,AITA for not laughing at my sister-in-law making my son cry?,"
My sis-in-law and her husband looked after my 7 year old overnight for the first time a few weeks ago. My son was excited leading up to it as he was going to spend the night staying at ""his favourite uncles house"". The next day my sis-in-law was telling us how funny it was when they made the uncle hide and pretended he'd left for the night. My son took it as a joke for a while and kept saying ""haha no he hasn't"" but they kept it up until ""he had a mini meltdown"" and started crying. They (this was the second sis-in-law who was present) also did this by hiding his Nintendo Switch and pretended they sold it. My sis-in-law was laughing her head off while sat there just looking a bit confused/suprised at what was funny. SIL said something along the lines of ""you don't have to look so traumatised!"" And, knowing how sensitive my wife's side of the family can be, I just replied ""sorry, but I don't find those kind of jokes funny"". SIL then exploded in front of everyone and went on a rant about how she doesn't feel like she can treat my son how she wants and doesn't tell him off how she wants because of me. For context when my son was born he was very premature and in intensive care for the first three weeks so for the first year I absolutely was a bit overprotective and I also got my sis in laws back up when my son fell over when he was three and screamed and I went running over asking if he was ok, even though his other aunt was already there and that one exploded then too shouting that ""she knows how to look after a child!"". Again then I was a bit confused that asking my son who was crying and distressed if he was ok should get such an angry reaction. I'm now paranoid about how I parent in front on my in-laws. So, am I the asshole? Maybe I'm missing something and should see their pov?

Update:
Thanks everyone, I just wanted to check I wasn’t overreacting or losing the plot.

I was always disciplined and worked hard to ensure I had good grades and got into a good university. Meanwhile. my brother dropped out at 17 and sat at home to play video games all day. He just recently got his high school diploma from an online school and applied for trade school.

From the ages of 19-22, my brother worked a full-time job and another part-time job on the weekends, he would always flaunt his savings account in front of me. No shit, he had no bills to pay and is cheap as hell. The last time he flaunted his savings account, he had well over $60,000. 

Now since he dropped out of high school and showed no signs of pursuing higher education, my parents transferred his education fund over to me ($25,000). I also got qualified for low interest student loans, grants, and tuition so I kept that money in the fund and have all of it still. 

Now that my brother applied to community college, he's asking me for ""his"" money back. I told him no, and that I'm not going to subsidize his mistake. I also reminded him of the many times he flaunted his savings account, and of course he cried poor. He's a big manipulator, so he edits his savings account and tried to fool me into thinking he lost all his money in some stupid investment scheme.

Basically my mother met my step father and he took me on as his own, they then went on to have my sister (A) a year later. My mum died and my step dad kept me as his daughter and then remarried (B) when my sister was 2.

B hated me as I wasn't my dads and look a lot like my mom and eventually talked my dad into kicking me out the house in my mid teens and I went to live w my dads sister and her wife before I went off to college. 10 years later I'm married and have two children, When I was pregnant with my first A was super excited to be an auntie and came to my baby shower and everything, however once my daughter was born she never visited, I offered to go to her, meet her halfway, go do something like coffee date or beach day or something but she was always busy. Same thing happened with my second daughter, A was a no show. We'd message all the time but when I invited her for birthdays or weekends she'd say she was coming then just not show up. Fast forward my children are 8 and 9 years old and have never met their aunt, they don't actually know anything about her, no how are you texts for about 5 years now as I stopped reaching out because she just kept blowing us off. My sister had her baby 4 months ago which I found out via Facebook. I didn't message her because I thought she didn't want anything to do with my kids why should I bother with hers?

I borrowed something from my dads sister and went to drop it off the other day while the kids were at school. My dad, A and B were there with A's baby. I tried to just leave but A cornered me about not congratulating her about the baby or asking how she was doing, and I said why would I you didn't do it for my kids? She blew up at me calling me selfish, I yelled back I don't make a habit of asking after strangers babies and that's what she was to me. My dad said that we were sisters and family is supposed to be there for each other. I'm ashamed to admit I did lose my temper with him and call him a cold hearted bastard and who was he to talk to me about family wearing his no.1 grandpa shirt when he had grandchildren he had never acknowledged?. Where I am probably the asshole is this all happened in my aunts' house and in front of A's baby who was sleeping at the time but still it's not ideal to be screaming in front of an infant.

1dek5u2,AITA for kicking my stepsister out of my birthday trip?,"I (19F) am the daughter of separated parents, and my father's new wife has a daughter, Sophie (18F).

Last year my friends and I, including my best friend, May (20F), Debby (20F), and another 4 girls, decided to go on a trip for  to celebrate my birthday.

My father called me to ask me to take Sophie with us, because she felt a little left out and i acepted it, even if me and her didint have a close relationship.

The trip was one of the best of my life, but I noticed that May was a little down. I asked what was wrong and she said she was fine, just a little tired, so I believed her.

When we returned home, we promised that the following year we would repeat the trip if possible.

But this year, when I started preparing everything, Debby came to talk to me and showed me prints from a group chat that i was not part, which had the exact date of the time we were on the trip, last year, where Sophie was talking bad about May and calling her names, like  ""Whale"", ""Fat bit\*\*"" and other cruel things.

(For context, May is a fat woman.)

I spoke to May and she confirmed that during the trip, Sophie was completely unpleasant to her, always commenting on her body and her personality, for no apparent reason. But she didn't say anything, so as not to ruin the vibe of the trip party, and to not create tension between me and my father's side of the family, and after the trip, she ended up forgeting about completly.

I went to my father's house, and told Sophie that I knew everything, and she turned pale when she saw the prints I had.

I basically kicked her out of the trip and told her I didn't want to see her again.

Now, the other girls in the group, apart from Debby and May, are saying that I was an asshole for kicking Sophie out for something so insignificant, and that if Sophie doesn't go, neither will they.

I'm on a trip with my friends. One of them came to my room to take a bath. She remarked how I haven't used the complementary toiletries when I should, used them, & called to have them refreshed. I didn't think anything of it.

The day we were to leave, she was present while I packed & commented how I hadn't packed the toiletries. I said I never do because I don't need them & it doesn't feel right. That's it. Exact words. But she got really offended over it. Went on for minutes about how people like me ruin it for 'working class' people like her (we work the same job??). How it's our right, included in our bills, & snooty attitudes like the one I'd displayed make the world look down upon the ethical practice of taking toiletries. She couldn't believe I would choose to be a jerk who sides with big, profit making hotels instead of the little man. I thought she might be stressed about something else or may be I had somehow been insensitive with that remark. I let her be & didn't react.

When it was our time to check out from the second hotel, the same thing happened all over again. She's not a weird person. But she's so adamant & passionate about this, it's making me question things.

1deiw9i,AITA for refusing to watch my cousin's kids anymore after she let me live with her rent free?,"I have a job coming up in a different state, and I wanted to visit my family before I went, since it's far away. So temporarily, my cousin said she would let me stay with her rent free.

I've been living on the couch for a month, and probably will for another month, since my offer was pushed back. I had to pawn off a lot of my stuff, since there was no room for it, which I've mostly accepted, since it was short notice. I do wish I had at least my own space.

She's also been paying for my food, since I wasn't expecting it to be this long, and didn't save up enough before moving, so I didn't want to complain. I haven't been doing chores much either, since her kids are MESSY, and I don't want to clean up after them constantly.

Initially, I didn't mind watching her kids, or letting her use my car. But it feels like she's taking advantage of me now. I've even told her I don't want to watch her kids all the time. She's started treating my car as her own, and will even leave it somewhere if her boyfriend picks her up, leaving me stranded. She will also plan on me watching her kids when she leaves, without asking me.

Yesterday, she said she was taking her kids somewhere, so I thought I could finally have some time to myself, but surprise, I had to watch her youngest because she's ""too young to go."" I normally go to the gym, but now it always feels like I'm too busy with her kids to do anything I want to do, and when I force the issue, it's mainly just to visit people I've been putting off visiting because of her, and I don't feel like I have any time to myself. I understand it's like that for parents, but I'm not a parent. They aren't my kids.

So I told her this, and said I can't keep watching her kids anymore and that she needs to get her own. It's too much for me, and they aren't my responsibility.

She got mad at me and told me if I hate it so much, that I should move out. That she's doing me a favor, and that since she hasn't made me pay rent and bought my food for me.

I agreed on that, but noticed that watching her kids is basically a full time job at this point, with permanent overtime. My SIL says that I should help her for her letting me stay and that I should also be helping with the chores, because being a parent is exhausting. Her husband (my brother) seems to understand my frustration, but wants to stay out of it, which I understand.

AITA for refusing to watch her kids anymore?

Edit: I don't mind watching her kids sometimes, or even letting her use my car. What I do mind is doing it 24/7. My point about the gym is that I go to the gym 30 minutes to an hour a few times a week, and I don't even have time to do that. I've also let her stay at my place before, before she had kids, and didn't ask anything from her.

Edit: Being an on call babysitter 24/7 is not equivalent for meals and only a couch to sleep on. She's getting way more out of this deal than I am, and people are on here calling me a deadbeat and a leech.

Edit: I've also offered to pay her $500 after I get my job. I think that's more than fair for what I got out of it.

1d9367a,WIBTA For Missing My Cousin's Wedding because She Didn't Send Me My Own Invitation,"This is petty, to be honest, but I'll give some backstory, so maybe it will make a little more sense. 
So I (26F) have a large extended family, like 10 cousins, most of whom have multiple kids now large. Despite being one of the oldest (3rd), I'm still kind of treated like a child. I believe this is because my family has a habit of having kids pretty young (e.i., Lots of teen moms and even those who plan for children have had them in their early twenties) and I'm child-free. It irks me since I've always been pretty independent, and now that I'm approaching my late 20s and have been living on my own for nearly 6 years, you'd think I'd get a little respect as an adult. But apparently not.
So I live about 3 hours away from where the rest of my family does, and I have been planning for months to visit for the Pride Parade held there. I live in a big city and the one they do here is just too hectic, so I prefer to go to that one. 
Well, I messaged my mom today asking when she's free so I can figure out a good time to visit with her and my siblings. She tells me not to worry about seeing just them, that we'll be able to spend plenty of time together at Cousin's(F22) wedding on Saturday. Cue confusion. I didn't know Cousin was getting married this weekend, but I didn't get any kind of invitation. I tell her that, and she's also confused because there's no reason Cousin wouldn't have invited me. I tell her it's no big deal anyways because I already have plans for that day. 
Well, I guess she mentioned something to Aunt (Cousin's mom) because she messaged me a few hours ago to tell me that I WAS invited, that I was on my mom's invitation as ""and Kids"". I tell her that that's too bad, because I already have plans for that night and that if they had really wanted me to go, they should have sent me my own invitation. I am an adult and live 3 hours away, so, of course, my mom isn't going to think I'm included in her ""and Kids"" invitation. I wasn't going to change my plans on a dime because of their shortsightedness. 
Well, apparently, that makes me an asshole. I've been getting messages from family left and right telling me I should skip the parade, that Cousin's wedding is more important because it's a one-time thing, but they do the parade every year. I haven't prepared to go to a wedding at all and I'mnot very close to that part of the family (they are ultra  religious). I'm pretty sure Cousin, herself, doesn't even care if I'm there or not.

1djvqyq,AITA for refusing to give my boyfriends’ cat back to his mother after his death?,"My boyfriend (26) of 3 years died in November of 2023 after getting in a car accident. He left behind his 2 cats Gizmo and Shortcake which we love dearly. Gizmo is 8 and Shortcake is 2.

Before we met, my boyfriend adopted Gizmo while he still lived with his mother so they all lived together for around 5 years before they moved out and moved in with me into my apartment and then we adopted Shortcake together a year ago from a local shelter.

Before his death, his mother and I had a decent relationship and we got along fine. I think his death brought us together more and she supported me throughout my grief. She would take me out for coffee and made sure I was eating well and taking care of myself, and I would try to help her out as well. 

Just recently she reaches out to me on whatsapp to ask about Gizmo and if she could come over to my place to say hi to him because she hadn’t seen him in a while. I said sure and she came over for around an hour ,we chatted about stuff and then she left. Later that night she messaged to ask me if she could maybe take Gizmo back to her house as he reminds him so much of her son and having Gizmo back would make her feel a lot better.

I said to her that it wouldn’t be fair on Gizmo to disrupt his routine on top of everything that’s happened as Gizmo was pretty shaken by the loss and was slowly starting to come back out of his shell. 

Her tone takes a 180 and she demands that I give her back Gizmo as it’s “technically her cat” and that she’s known him longer than I have so she has “more of a right to him than I do”. I refuse and try to reason with her but Gizmo is fine where he is. She sends me in full capitals that “the grief of a mother is more than the grief of a girlfriend”. 

I genuinely considered giving Gizmo back to her after she said that but I love Gizmo with my whole heart and I don’t want to make this harder on him that what it has to be and anyone with a pet would relate to that. 

In the morning she asked me to reconsider my answer to which I say it’s still a no and she leaves me on read. She then blasts me on facebook calling me a “selfish” and I get a dozen messages on facebook from her family calling me the same but I am still standing firm on my decision. This whole situation has put major strain on my relationship with her and my boyfriend’s extended family. This is a side of her I’ve never seen before and I think it’s damaged our relationship to a point of no return which sucks as they were my support system during my boyfriend’s death. It hurts me to think what my boyfriend would’ve thought of this whole situation as him and his mother were super close as well. I don’t know what he would’ve wanted me to do but regardless Gizmo is staying with me.

1doikmj,AITA for telling my mom she wasn't perfect? ,"My mom was an absolute narcissist growing up. We had to have gendered interests (no Legos for me). I had to take extracurricular activities she liked (no drama club or band). I was grounded for not being allowed on the cheerleader teams, and she would call our friends fat or poor if they didn't meet her expectations. I was on a diet as a kid and not allowed to eat the same as my brother’s. 

My SIL (Kate ) mom (Debbie) was the opposite, allowing her kids to do what they wanted and have the interest just for them. Kate is a lovely, well-adjusted woman; her mother, whom I have met several times, is a kind soul. 

We had a graduation party for my youngest brother. Kate made us cupcakes, and they were delicious. My mom made a snide remark about wishing I could be as perfect as Kate. I told my mom I knew that feeling because Debbie was such a perfect mom, and I wished she was my mother so I could have turn out perfect like Kate. 

My mom flipped her shit and started yelling at me, asking how I could say that to her. I pointed out that Kate seemed perfect because she had a good childhood with good parents, and I’m sure I would have bloomed into a person like Kate under the same opportunities. 

My mom kicked me out of the party and got mad at me for upsetting everyone with my disrespectful behavior. I went home, and Kate and my brother stopped by later, bringing me some cupcakes and wine. We talked, and neither was mad at me. My mom, however, goes to Facebook to air her dirty laundry and shame me (this is not new behavior, so I’m unfazed by that). Several people called me ungrateful and said my mom did the best she could for us. I find it laughable, but family members say I need to apologize, but she started it by saying, “Kate is perfect.” ",Ordinary-Struggle154,1601,153,0.9700000286102295,0.1012156397674857,1719354005,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1doikmj/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_wasnt_perfect/,2024,6
1ddrfmi,WIBTA for refusing to leave my dog with a stranger for three weeks to go on vacation?,"I (M36) and currently having a disagreement with my wife (F35) about leaving my dog with her uncle while we go on vacation.

This started when my therapist suggested that me sitting home alone all the time (I work from home) wasn't helping me (PTSD and anxiety from being an ER/PSYCH nurse) and that I should get a dog. I've never had a dog before so I figured I'd try it. My first attempt the puppy had a birth defect and died after a month of having it and I was devastated (no one knew about the defect till the puppy had passed away). My wife convinced me to give it one more go and that led to me getting Sadie, my newfoundland puppy.

This dog has been life changing. Better than any antidepressant I've ever had. My blood pressure is down, I lost weight, I don't have nightmares anymore since she wakes me up if I have one. I train her, I walk her twice a day, we go to group classes for dog training once a week, I brush her, I take her out to the park. She's amazing and she's the sweetest animal I've ever seen. I can go out in public with her without feeling like I'm about to be attacked by something. My therapist suggested training her as a service dog since I qualify for one if she was this helpful so I'm doing that but she isn't fully trained yet as she's only a year and a half old.

Well I was going to go on vacation, and my sister was going to watch the dog for me since my wife wanted some time just the two of us without the dog. I was okay with this when she was going to be at our house with my sister, but my sister's husband got transferred to another state and now they can't watch her. My wife suggested I leave her with her uncle who has a newfoundland and a fenced in yard.

I can't do it, the amount of anxiety I have over something happening to her is insane. She's the perfect dog right now, I'm terrified something is going to happen and I'm going to lose her and then have to go back to what life was like before I got her. I was miserable, no amount of meds helped me, no amount of exercise or eating right made any difference, It was soul crushing and now that I'm better I would do anything to never feel like that again. I know it sounds insane but I had totally given up on ever feeling like a normal person again and then I got Sadie and suddenly I felt like I was me again. I can't even begin to tell you how much of a difference having Sadie has made in my life.

My wife insists everything would be fine and that I'm being a crazy person for not wanting to leave the dog alone to go on a vacation but she understands and says she won't force the issue if I really have a problem with it but I feel like a serious POS for picking a dog over a vacation with my wife. I told her to give me some more time and let me finish her service dog training but she wants me to go on this vacation just the two of us and I'm just horribly uncomfortable leaving her with some stranger I've never even met in a place I've never even been.

So WIBTA for refusing to go?",Stunning_Bag9079,394,405,0.8299999833106995,0.09981646742800704,1718145867,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ddrfmi/wibta_for_refusing_to_leave_my_dog_with_a/,2024,6
1dkpgp0,AITA for telling my younger sister her life is going to suffer?,"I 17f have a younger sister 16f and she has gotten pregnant. She told us 3 months ago and the dad didn't want the baby but she kept it anyways. Well the the other day I was getting ready to go out when my sister was standing in my doorway looking all sad. I asked her what was wrong and she said she wants to go out but is pregnant and cannot go hang out with friends anymore.

I told her she should have took that into consideration when she did what she did. I said her life is going to suffer now that she has to worry about a baby. And that her baby matters more than her now and she should have not did what she did if she wanted to still live out her teenage years.

She started crying and went to her room leaving for me to finish getting ready. My mom came up to me when I got back from hanging out with my friends and said I was rude for saying that to her but I felt like she needed a reality check.

1d94jm5,"AITA for telling my friend to stop saying ""I almost died"" as an excuse?","I (33 F) am friends with a (36 F) named Ashley. Ashley recently had to have an emergency C-section at 6 months pregnant. She and the baby are doing well but the baby girl is in the NICU and she is recovering. When I found out I immediately sent her a care package, bought a crib she couldn't afford, and reached out regularly within the past month. I live across the country  from her so I can't just up and travel. I noticed over that time Ashley would ask for things or complain about feeling that her friends and her child's father are not doing enough for her or being around enough for her. I would do what I can with the monetary requests she has made and reach out to check in when I could. I told her that I am very annoyed by her complaining and she needs to accept that my life does not stop just because she had a baby. She responds by saying ""I almost died giving birth"". I responded that she has said this every time I have spoken to her when she complains about something. I also said that she cannot make monetary requests, complain afterwards, throw almost dying in my face, then make more requests like I'm an unlimited ATM. She said that until I experience what she has then I won't understand where she is coming from and being there for her in these ways shows how important she and the baby are in my life. I responded that in the time since she gave birth I have injured my foot and can barely walk which led to unexpected financial problems and have other challenges in my life that she does not even ask about. I said I was not in the bedroom when she got pregnant so she needs to take this up with the man who knocked her up. We haven't spoken since then and I refuse to help her anymore as long as she acts this entitled.  AITA? 

EDIT: Ashley's child's father is in the picture.  He has been getting complaints from her about not being at the hospital enough. He has had to pick up overtime at work to make up for the lost income. They also have another child, so he has been mostly taking care of the older child while she is in the hospital.

1dejtry,"AITA for ""financially big-footing"" my in-laws?","I (39M) am a few years older than my wife (32F), but we met (5 years ago) at very different phases of our lives. I finished uni at 19 years old, lucked into a great position in finance and became a partner of my firm, making me quite wealthy at a young age. My wife went through several changes of heart about her career path, involving two advanced degrees, through which her parents supported her. She had only recently started her first full time, “professional” job when we met.  Her parents’ (born to wealthy families on the last bits of their fortunes) financial support engendered a belief on their part that she ought to pay heed to their wishes.  While my wife found this behavior bothersome, she is conflict-averse and mostly acceded to their demands.

Her parents offered to pay for our wedding. It quickly became clear that they felt that their contribution entitled them to make most of the choices (including guest list), none of which were congenial to my now-wife. The conflict clearly wore on her, so told her parents that we appreciated their kind offer, but that we would pay for the wedding ourselves.  Perhaps having judged my financial situation by my modest lifestyle, they claimed we were “risking our finances” merely to have our way. I just laughed and said that wasn’t a worry.  We ended up having a swanky destination wedding, accommodations on us, for our friends and close family only.

After we got married, we experienced the same crap. Case in point – vacations. My MIL inherited a beach house, and she insisted that we spend our vacations there at a particular time, to coincide with my SIL, even though the dates were convenient neither to us nor SIL.  When my wife pointed this out, her mother’s response was that it would be difficult to accommodate us at other times, as they had set plans with friends over the course of the summer; that since she and FIL were generously opening their house to us, we needed to conform to her schedule.  Not again! I had been thinking about getting a summer place myself, so I bought one in my wife’s favorite area. It happens to be bigger and nicer than MIL’s.  MIL reacted peevishly to the news, claiming that we were spitefully “bankrupting ourselves to show her up” and that vacations should be spent with family. I replied that, as to the latter point, they were welcome to come spend time with their daughter and SIL (who is great!)…on dates convenient for us.  As to the former, I said, that while I consider it gauche to talk to about money, she should rest easy about our finances, as the new place amounted to less than my last year’s partnership distribution; and that they would be wise to stop trying to exert control with money, since to do it successfully requires an actual fortune,and not just the memory of one as embodied in a broken-down beach house.  My MIL called me a jerk. I realize I spoke pretty harshly, but I think I was justified.",Thin_Leather7975,1183,196,0.9100000262260437,0.09170357579423291,1718232282,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dejtry/aita_for_financially_bigfooting_my_inlaws/,2024,6
1dm8gze,WIBTA if I ask a special-needs customer to stop coming to my store,"I (34F) work in a higher end of town in a specialty boutique style store. I am currently seven months pregnant and the only employee. I maintain a pretty healthy relationship with everybody in town, other stores, even our competitors. I want everyone to feel safe, accepted and welcome. In the time I work, and there are many restaurants, and there is one gentleman who walks through the town and visits at some of the stores on his way to work. He has high functioning autism. He can drive he has a job. He has a masters degree and several other things. I recently told him that I was pregnant so that he could prepare for my leaving for maternity. I let him touch my belly that day. He has been in every single day since, almost three weeks, to come try to touch my belly to feel the baby. The issue is I don't like to be touched. I also don't like people coming up behind me. For contacts I have complex PTSD. And people behind me is one of my triggers.  Also being the only employee I can't often stop. I have expressed to him many times that I cannot stop every day to let him touch my belly and he has recently taken up on him to walk behind me even while I'm with other customers to touch my belly. I told him that was no ok. He didn't come in for two days and when he did a few days later, he tried to touch my belly, but he asked so I said fine. However, he tried lifting my shirt so he could touch my bare skin, and I snapped and said absolutely not. he came back in the next day walk straight towards me trying to feel my belly too, which I told him we cannot do this anymore. You may not come in to touch my belly. It is Taurus season and I am far too busy and I do not like this. Today he tried coming in again and I'm contemplating just telling him he's not allowed in my store anymore. He never buys anything and mostly browses anyway when he was here before. I understand that some people do not have the same concept of personal space however, I do not believe that that is an excuse as I told him many times in a way, he would understand that it was not OK. So would I be the asshole for kicking him out?

1dq5y1k,AITA for looking up what happens in the shows my husband and I watch?,"I was never one to sit down and watch a show or movie before I met my husband. Naturally it was him who introduced me to most if not all of the shows we now watch.  I'm an anxious person by nature and when things are intense I can't enjoy the show so I will look up what happens.

  
My husband gets so upset when I do this because he says the only reason he is rewatching this show/ movie is so that he can watch my reactions to certain things in it and when I look things up I have no reaction at all because I know it's coming.

  
It got particularly heated last night when we started watching this show called the last of us.  It has quite a few tense moments and early on I started to look things up. He saw me doing this and after some back and forth he said he won't be recommending anything else for us to watch if I'm just going to spoil what happens.

  
I think he is being a bit unfair because he had already seen the entire show and knows what happens but im not allowed to know.

1dpajhb,AITA for asking my boyfriend to be sober for once while we make a memory? ,"TLDR: My boyfriend thinks it’s impossible to have fun sober and even try won’t try. we’ve been together for 2 years and has yet to make one memory with me without the interference of drugs/alcohol. 



I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for almost 2 years, we met freshman year of college and are now entering our senior year. 

My boyfriend has had a history with substance abuse (he got a DUI last year and is now on deferred prosecution so he’s on probation for 5 years). He’s been completely sober for about 6 months.

For the entire duration of our relationship he was either drunk or high, or both. We don’t have a single memory together that doesn’t involve drugs or alcohol. I’m a social drinker, but with him being sober and us never “going out” or doing anything, it’s a rare occurrence for me to drink. I never smoke or do any sort of drug. Nothing against it, it’s just not for me. 

There’s a rave he wants to go to in August, he’s never been to one and is really interested in going. Neither of us are fans of EDM but i’ve never been to a rave either. I think it could be fun to experience something new so he suggested we go together. 

We started planning the trip, outfits, and started saving money to be able to go. Then he brings up how he’s going to be on shrooms and acid the entire time we’re there. I asked why and said i wanted to experience something new and fun with him, without the interference of drugs and alcohol for once. he got offended and told me there’s no point in going to a rave sober and that if he can’t do drugs he just won’t go. 

I tried explaining that it’s entirely possible to have fun sober and going to a rave shouldn’t be an excuse to do drugs. Acid and shrooms are cheap, spending hundreds of dollars to go to a rave with the sole purpose of doing drugs seems like a waste to me. 

He flipped out and told me he doesn’t want to go anymore, he doesn’t want to go with me, and i ruined everything.

All i did was ask him to make a memory with me and be fully present for it, for the past 2 years i can’t think of a single “fun” thing we’ve done that he was sober for and it makes me really sad. My boyfriend genuinely thinks it’s impossible to have fun without being under the influence of something, and won’t even try to do something that could possibly be fun if he has to be sober for it. 

Am i the asshole?
