1elut6n,AITA for refusing my girlfriends request of peeing sitting down in our home,"Recently, me (M24) and my (F23) girlfriend moved into a new place together. Everything about living together and the living situation has been great, expect when we got into an argument a few days ago about something which I find quite bizarre.

She pulled me aside as I was getting ready for bed a few days ago and had a conversation with me, telling me that I needed to stop peeing standing up. She told me it was gross and that she didn’t want to be stepping all over my waste when she went to the bathroom. Keep in mind we live in a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom studio apartment. 

Now yes I wholeheartedly sympathize with women who have to deal with asshole men who act like slobs in the bathroom, and I would understand my girlfriend expect I did none of this. No urine got on the seat, floor or anywhere near it, no smell remained in the bathroom, and I always left the lid down to flush anyway for hygiene.

I told her this, but she has refused to listen out and has told me multiple times she doesn’t want me peeing standing up and thinks its gross. Now really this is my home too we are splitting the rent, and I think I have every right to piss standing up in my own home and think its ridiculous.",Then_Task3485,8411,7656,0.8399999737739563,0.8290946083418107,1722982233,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1elut6n/aita_for_refusing_my_girlfriends_request_of/,2024,8
1eoeahu,AITA for wearing a two piece to my kids’ swimming lessons?,"I (27f) am a mother to quadruplets aged 2. This is their first year taking swimming lessons, and, at their age, the lessons require one-one-one with the child/adult as well as an instructor to teach. So me, my husband, and two of my husbands friends came along. (Unfortunately all four of the kids got booked for the same time). They started the lessons on Monday and ended today (Friday). 

At the lessons, all the other kids had their mothers/female guardians with them, and all of them wore shorts/shirt swimsuits. My husband/his friends had trunks with no shirt, and I wore a two piece. Nothing bad, everything was well covered, but obviously my stomach and back showed. I didn’t think it was a big deal, and I honestly didn’t even notice what everyone wore until probably Wednesday. And it was fine because everybody (including me) was modest. 

However, they finished their lessons today. When everyone was getting changed to leave, a few mothers came up to me. They said they didn’t want to mention it earlier to make classes awkward, but they and a few other mothers were uncomfortable with how I was wearing a two piece to the lessons all week. The suggested if I do another class with my kids here, I cover up my stomach because nobody wants to see it Because of the stretch marks from my pregnancy. (Which is a lot more than average because I had quadruplets). I asked if they had an issue with how my husband/his friends didn’t wear a shirt at all, and they said the didn’t care because they didn’t have the “baby belly” like I did. 

Now I’m back home, and I can’t decide if they were being rude or just were honest. They made sure to tell me it wasn’t about the modesty, it was just my stomach. I never thought about it, so maybe it’s my fault for being careless and not thinking of everyone else. My husband says I was fine, but all the mothers there apparently don’t think so.

1eiorrn,AITAH telling girlfriend that she gave me the 'ick' at a family dinner? ,"I'm 32m dating my girlfriend Jenny 27f for almost a year now, and we've meet each other's families. Jenny is an only child of an asian family while I'm half/half with one younger sister, Anna 21f. Anna and I are close despite our age gap, our parents both worked demanding jobs and I would babysit/chaperone for many of her bratty teen years.

In recent months I've noticed that whenever Anna comes up in conversation, Jenny would joke about how Anna is overly spoiled by my parents and I and how we've created a princess. Last week at a family dinner with my parents I felt like Jenny was overly grilling Anna on school/dating/life. At one point, Anna was telling a story about how a first date gave her ""the ick"" by not pull out his wallet after their meal and let her foot the full meal. Jenny laughed and said that not every man will treat her to dinner like her brother would and that ""you need to lower your standards."" I was not happy with this comment as it sounded like my sister didn't deserve to be treated with basic respect but also didn't want to embarrass Jenny.

Jennifer then went on talk about how that would've never happen to her as men see her as ""high value"". I don't know what about this comment that just pissed me off but I said that she was giving ME ""the ick"" and to stop talking to my sister like that.

The argument we had when we got home was massive, and Jenny told me that I was over-reacting to an innocuous comment and would make a terrible father because I would always favor my sister over everyone else. I'm shocked at called a 'terrible father' and honestly still don't think I was wrong, but need another opinion.",Nonfrench_Fries3621,12509,1857,0.9200000166893005,0.6107132225651362,1722641959,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1eiorrn/aitah_telling_girlfriend_that_she_gave_me_the_ick/,2024,8
1ejeqr1,AITA for refusing to take my girlfriend home from a party after she embarrassed herself? ,"A coworker invited me to a housewarming party, he bought a really nice house with a large yard, a pool and even a waterfall flowing into the pool. I wouldn't say I'm necesarrily friends with him but we're friendly and make small talk when we see each other, we don't really hang out  by ourselves. He's a nice guy but we don't have too many interests. He told me I can bring my girlfriend. At that party I knew about 3 out of the 40 people there. 

At the party my girlfriend began complaining to me about the food options saying they don't follow her diet, she can't eat them, the host should have gotten better food, the paintings on the wall are tacky, his furniture sucks, that the music is pretty lame and a bunch of other ridiculous complaints.  We live in São Paulo at the moment but we're from a region in Southern Brazil where most people speak Hunsrik, which is a type of German, though its a bit distinct from standard German, someone from Germany wouldn't understand everything I say.

 She complained in Hunsrik, assuming that everyone at the party only knew Portuguese but my coworker was near us and he said what I guess is standard German ""I'm sorry we don't have any food that fits your dietary restrictions, if you are hungry there is a store about 400 meters from here, it closes in an hour. I'm sorry you don't appreciate the music selection would you like to play something?"" 

My girlfriend looked shock, her jaw dropped and she just stuttered for a bit, a few people snicker in the back and another guy translates what happened and she responded back in Portuguese ""how do you all know German? I had no idea"" and my coworker explains he and 3 other people in this party used to work in Germany and that's how they know each other. My girlfriend pulled me aside and said she's so embarassed and wants to go home. I told her no, I'm having a good time here and she's begging me to bring her back saying she's so embarassed and she can't handle this and I told her she shouldn't talk shit about people and she's getting what she deserved, this broke out into a screaming match. She demanded i give her the car keys and I refused. 

We stayed at the party for another 2-3 hours, she talked to some other girls but was kind of quiet. On the ride home we got into another argument where she says I should have taken her side and I unleashed a lot of my frustration onto her saying she is actually the one causing embarassment by insulting my coworker. She blamed me for not telling her he speaks German I told her that wasn'r relevant and i never thought to bring it up. (I honestly didn't know he spoke it that well, he just briefly mentioned living in Germany once at a meeting). 

so yeah was I in the wrong here?

1f3nt3w,AITA for refusing my birthday gift because it was a weight watchers subscription?,"
Hi Reddit, I turned 18 (female) yesterday but it seems to caused a bit of drama in my family so im asking for honest, objective opinions on whether im wrong. I’m using a throwaway account because this situation is obviously very humiliating for me

For reference, my weight has always been made fun of in my family. My aunt specifically has always been very unkind and fat shamed me, even when I was younger and struggling with my body image. She used to tell me that my clothes looked so small on me, and that even her clothes are probably small for me. She used to remind me to go on diets constantly. Im currently 320lbs if it adds contexts too 

I hadn’t seen my aunt in a while and for the most part I was really glad to see her for my birthday. I was slightly dreading if she would say anything to me because im aware I have gained a lot of weight since I last saw her, but she just made a few comments so I thought it was the end of it. 

I was opening a birthday card she gave me a few hours later and it had money in it, with a note that said “money for weight watchers, make some real change for once”. This was humiliating and I asked her about it and she said that she could tell I was miserable and that I probably look really good underneath the fat. She said this in front of my parents, and it was very embarrassing. I told her im not accepting the gift and she’s making me look stupid, but she said that she was just worried for me and my health. I don’t believe this, she’s made fun of my weight for years even before I was a teenager. But my parents think I was overreacting and I should’ve just accepted it. My aunt has a notoriously big mouth and my parents think she’s going to tell our whole family so they’re getting kind of worried about what I’ve done.

1el0x4d,AITA for making a dessert with my 2 year old for a potluck.,"We had a potluck at work last week.  I made this delicious brownie & cookie concoction with a caramel sauce.  When I made it, my 2 year old was by my side and ""helping"" as much as he could.  

  
When I put the dish out at the potluck I added a sign that my son helped make it.  I thought that was the right thing to do in case people had an issue with it.  A co-worker who has made it known does not like kids, She has complained to HR about my kid being around at the end of the day for 15-30 minutes.  

  
This co-worker approached me and said that it wasn't fair that I made a dish that she wouldn't eat.  I told her I just made the dish, i'm not concerned with who did and didn't eat it.  She said that making a dish that wasn't made in a safe way and bringing it is not okay. I felt like providing the sign was enough to allow people to make their own decisions.   She called me an asshole and I felt like she was blowing this way out of proportion.  But AITA?  ",Secret-Departure1215,8701,1619,0.9200000166893005,0.44617541387413695,1722896235,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1el0x4d/aita_for_making_a_dessert_with_my_2_year_old_for/,2024,8
1esdw0m,AITA for telling my siblings I don’t want to split the bill equally since they have kids and I don’t?,"I have two older sisters (both over 30 years old), while I’m still in my 20s. The thing is, they suggested to invite my mom to lunch for Mother’s Day and they were talking about splitting the expenses in 3 parts. Both of them have 2 kids each while I don’t. Given past (bad) experiences where the kids were not contemplated in the bill but still would eat I told them I did not like the idea of splitting in 3 since their kids should be taken into account, mind you, the kids are not babies, one of them will soon turn 18. At the mention of that they did not like it and called me confrontational and my mom even found out and took their side, as per usual.  

To give you some more context as to why it bothers me: A similar experience happened before during a trip where I had to pay a third out of all the expenses, my mom another and my sister another (husband and kids included). She thought my mom and I were oblivious about the whole thing but my mom begged me to not say anything to not start a fight but now I think I’ve held my silence for long.

So, the question is, AITA for wanting the bill to be split differently considering I don’t have kids and I’m only paying for my share and my mom’s?

1f206bz,AITA for making my son (16) pay for his own room?,"I'm a single mom of 5 (16M, 14M, 10M, 9F, 7M) renting a 3-bedroom house.

Up until 2 months ago the 2 eldest boys shared a room, the 3 youngest shared, and I had the smallest room. 

For the last few years my eldest complained non-stop about having to share a room with his little brother. Most of his friends’ parents are wealthy so he's constantly comparing our situation to theirs. 

He started working when he was 14 (a few hours a week) for a little extra money, now at 16 he works a lot (more than I would like) and this summer he has been working basically fill-time. He's not too bad with his money and actually saves some of it, but the rest goes to video games, clothes/shoes, and junk food. 

2 months ago, my son and I were discussing his distaste for sharing a room with his brother and he said he'd drop out of school now if it meant he could move out into his own space. I told him I had looked at 4-bedroom rentals in our area, but they were just too expensive. He asked if he could pay the difference if we did move. I told him no because during the school year all his money would be going to rent not his savings and his spending money. That obviously wouldn't sit right with me.

However, we did come up with a compromise. For $50 a month he could have my bedroom and my 10-year-old could move in with 14-year-old and I would sleep in our living room (our couch is already a pull-out). This was 2 months ago, and we already made the switch, and everybody is happy with the new set up. 

All the money my son is paying me is going straight into my Christmas savings and then after Christmas will go into a summer trip savings. 

I recently told some of my friends what I was doing and they're against it. They think I'm wrong for taking any amount of money from my kids and a couple of them said I should have just given him the room without making him pay for it. They make some good points, and I don't totally disagree, and it makes me feel like an asshole.

My 14-year-old son is also unhappy about the arrangement, he thinks its unfair older brother is getting his own room and that middle brother should have stayed in his old room. I can see how he feels it's unfair that older brother has the chance to pay for his own room when he (or the other kids) don’t have the same opportunity.

It seems bad to renege with my oldest now, but I'm not sure if I made a mistake agreeing to this. AITA?",Maleficent_Trick_489,4340,2724,0.8600000143051147,0.3477095307961411,1724708688,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f206bz/aita_for_making_my_son_16_pay_for_his_own_room/,2024,8
1eu2nsl,AITA for being picky and not eating the food my husband bought for me?,"I’m really frustrated with how my husband handles my food preferences. He constantly says that I don’t like anything and gets upset when I can’t eat certain things. It’s not that complicatedI generally can’t stand spicy, ""sweet and sour"" (like in Chinese food, i dont like sweetness in my main dish) or acidic foods.I also hate raw tomatoes and calamari. I always cook and at restaurants there is always something I can enjoy.  That’s basically all he needs to remember. I dont think I am too picky. He says it’s difficult because of the exceptions, like I only like pineapple and oranges when they’re sweet. I can discern if they will be sweet or acidic, so I can choose when to buy them. But what’s so hard about that? If they’re not sweet, they’re acidic, and I don’t like acidic food.

His bosses recently offered to buy something for me when they were out, and my husband chose sweet and sour chicken that usually I dont like. But one time I mentioned that there was an exception for a certain restaurant. This time, the dish was both spicy and sour. I tried to eat it because he had already bought it, but I just couldn’t. He got mad and told me to throw it out then.

To clarify: I don't like sweetness in my main dish. So, no sugar, lime or too much spicy in my dishes. And I have told him this literally many times. The issue is he got mad because I did not eat the food he brought. It was too spicy for me.",Milerian,2454,3352,0.800000011920929,0.3149301733684517,1723849340,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1eu2nsl/aita_for_being_picky_and_not_eating_the_food_my/,2024,8
1eoeupa,AITA For Not Letting My Wife Have Some Of My Earnings From A Business Of Which She Wanted No Part?,"My wife and I had discussed my starting a business for a few years. I was under the impression we would be partners in the business. When the time came, I needed my wife's signatures on a few pieces of paperwork. She was adamant she wanted absolutely nothing to do with the business. In fact, those were her literal words: ""I want nothing to do with this business. It is entirely your project"" and she was quite angry about it. So, I took on other partners.

Well, the business has since become profitable and she has recently been making plans for the use of the money I make from the business as if it were her own. I told her (paraphrasing) ""This money is my money. It is not yours. It is in a separate account with only my name on it. You said you wanted nothing to do with the business and said it was entirely my project."" This pissed her off.

My wife also found out I altered my will to leave my share of the business and the money in the aforementioned account to my business partners and not her. She is now livid because it means, if I die before her, she will end up with only the assets we had from before I started running the business full-time and the money she made while working. I told her again ""You said you wanted nothing to do with the business and said it was entirely my project.""

1eodjv2,"AITA for letting my daughter wear whatever she is comfortable in, in my house?","Okay, this requires some important details. First, I am a (37M). My ex wife, ""Deanna"" (36F) and I have 2 kids, our daughter ""Jane"" (12F) and our son ""Eddie"" (10M). We got married semi young at 23 and 24, we divorced amicably five years ago. 

Deanna recently married a man she has been seeing for a few years, who I will call ""A."" Something I need to bring up here is that I am half Mexican, Deanna is a white woman, and A is of Middle Eastern descent. While I wouldn't say A and I are friends, I do think he's a pretty nice guy, and seems like a really good match for Deanna. The kids also like him, so that's another bonus in my book.

Deanna and I split custody of the kids. HOWEVER.  Deanna and A got married two months ago. Since then, Deanna has chosen to wear a covering, which I am sorry but the name slips my mind. She converted to A's religion as well. Which, I'm very happy about if that's what she wants. But last week, when she dropped off the kids, I was surprised to see that Jane was wearing one as well. But, I assumed she must have wanted to wear it and was maybe deciding to convert her faith as well, so I didn't bring it up. I feel that she's old enough to decide for herself, and as an atheist myself, I'm all for my children choosing what they believe

A few days ago, I was going to go see a movie with my kids but told them I had to finish some paperwork in my office first, which took about half an hour. When I walked back into the living room, Jane was wearing one of Eddie's t shirts and a pair of shorts. We had a conversation which kind of went like this:


Me: what's going on? Jane, are you supposed to take off your covering? (I don't really know how any of it works, sorry if that offends anyone)

Eddie: she hates wearing that  stuff. So I let her borrow some of my clothes.

Jane: yeah dad, I hate it. Mom makes me wear it. She says I have to wear it all the time, even at your house.

Me: so, you aren't choosing to wear it?

Jane: no. I never want to wear it again.


I checked her bag, and sure enough, it contained tank tops underwear, and the coverings (which cover the hair and body, but not the face.) I took the kids on a quick target trip before the movie to get Jane some clothes of her liking. Two days ago, when Deanna came by to pick up the kids, she flipped out on Jane for not wearing the traditional clothing. Deanna and I got into a heated argument, and I told her that Jane shouldn't HAVE TO wear the covering if she doesn't want to, especially because it's very hot in our city. Deanna argued that she and the kids are now different amd follow a stricter religion,
  I might be the a-hole because I argued back that it is stupid that the religion would force young girls to cover up so much all the time and  be so strict about it. Deanna took offense, and left with the kids. I feel bad because I don't want to insult a while country or countries but I don't think my daughter should have to wear anything she doesn't want to.

1f188ve,AITA For asking my husband not to poop in the main bathroom? ,"We have three bathrooms in our house. One is right outside the main living space, the other is in our bedroom and then we have a half bath in the utility hall.

Not only can I sometimes hear him pooping, but it's the only bathroom with an actual bathtub and we give the kids baths after dinner. I don't want to listen to my husband poop and then do baths in a stinky poop smelling bathroom when there are literally two other bathrooms he can use. 

When we moved in together into the house we put the poop stool from his house in the utility bathroom and dubbed it the poop bathroom. Now he just uses the kids foot stool. I have asked him COUNTLESS times to quit pooping in the main bathroom.

1elx9uy,AITA for telling my husband we can get a new babysitter if he finds a better one for the same price ,"My husband and I have 3 kids (10, 8, 5). We’ve had the same babysitter, Amelia (20) for almost 5 years. Amelia has filled a few different roles for us. She was our date night sitter, then during the pandemic she was our nanny, went back to date nights, and now she gets to our house at 7:15 every morning, gets the kids out the door, drops them off at school or camp, then twice a week she babysits at night so we can run errands or get some time to ourselves. 

Amelia’s “sweet spot” was 2022-2023. She had her car and license, had games and activities planned for everyone, was always on time and prepared, and was generally more available and focused. She’s still good now but doesn’t always come with crafts and activities, can be 5-10 minutes late, and more often than not orders DoorDash for herself to our house. It’s all manageable and she still knows and loves our kids and she’s very affordable. 

The final straw for my husband was when Amelia told us that she had recently been diagnosed with autism and that she thinks our 8 year old should get an assessment, as they are exactly alike. I never would’ve known Amelia is autistic but I’m definitely willing to get an assessment. My husband saw it as rude and thinks she shouldn’t have brought it up unless we asked. 

He thinks it’s time to get a new sitter so I told him we can get a new sitter if he can find someone just as good as Amelia for the same rate as her. He says we can afford better than Amelia so we can spend more and get someone that will be focused on their work like Amelia used to be before she started college and got another job.

It started during the pandemic when she and her husband needed help balancing work-from-home and childcare, and I was happy to step in. I didn’t expect any payment at first because, well, family.

But now things are back to normal. She’s back at work full-time, and I’m also busy with my job and personal life. Despite this, she’s still asking me to babysit at least once a week, sometimes more. The issue is, she never offers to pay me or even says a simple “thank you.” It’s just expected that I’ll do it.

Last week, I finally told her I can’t keep doing this for free, and if she wants me to babysit, she either needs to pay me or at least express some gratitude. She got really upset, saying I was being selfish and that family should help each other out without expecting anything in return.

I get that family helps family, but I feel taken advantage of. I’m not asking for much, just a token of appreciation or even an occasional break. Now she’s not speaking to me, and our parents are saying I should apologize to keep the peace.

However, they take half my earnings and say it’s because “they’re my parents, they deserve it”. That, plus me having to pay for my phone bill, leaves me with a rather small amount of money for me to have.

The other night, my family took me and my sisters out for dinner, since my older sister could come down from her college. We all eat, and have a generally good time until the check comes. My parents decided to pay for everybody **but** me. I had to pay for myself. So, naturally, I ask my parents about it. From there, the conversation escalates into a full-blown argument, which ends in them saying that I’m kicked out of the house. I say fine, and go to stay at a friend’s house for the night, hoping they didn’t mean it and will cool off by the next day.

The next day, I received a text from them saying that I needed to pick my things up from the house. I go to the house, and find all my stuff sitting on the front porch packed up. They were serious about their threat. My friend, being very nice, decided to let me stay at their house for the time being, until either I’m allowed back home, or I find someplace else.

It was also the day that I received my paycheck (it was resent since the first one bounced). When I go to get it, I find that my parents have cashed the WHOLE paycheck, not just the usual half they do. This obviously gets me more pissed off, and I go off on my parents again. They say that they’re going to disown me, which considering what they just did, makes me believe they actually will.

So AITA?

Edit for clarification: When I was young, my family was under financial stress, so me and my sister had to work to help out.

1emr3xf,AITA for ‘blindsiding’ my roommates after moving out?,"I 23F share a flat with Sara 24F and Vera 24F. Rent in our city is very expensive and all of us can only affording living here by renting a 3bed flat as we couldn’t by ourselves or in a 2 bed flat. 

Me and Vera were single when we moved in last year and Sara had a boyfriend Jake 26M.  Jake is clean, quiet and pays part of our utilities as he comes over most nights. 

Vera has recently started dating Oli 23M who is a friend of Jake and Sara’s. Oli has made a few weird comments about me- he pestered me about my weight and told me he could bench me and also asked me some weird sexual questions. When I flagged this to Vera, (I’ve never met Oli) she said he’s just trying to be friends. Sara and Jake said it was just his sense of humour.

Last week, me and Vera had a big fight after I overheard Vera and Oli in the shower together. We have one bathroom in the house, and my bedroom shared a wall, so I heard them having sex. They also didn’t clean the shower afterwards, and Sara stayed at her parents that week, so I ended up cleaning the shower.

I brought up this issue to Sara, who isn’t confrontational and said now that I’ve brought it up to Vera she knows how I feel and won’t do it again- but she didn’t at all find it as weird as I did. Since then I have avoided Oli/Vera and kept to myself.

I am not really friends with Vera anymore, and Sara remains neutral which favours Vera so I was thinking of moving out. We had all signed on for the next year as our contract renews in September, before I met Oli, and my estate agency said I couldn’t get out unless the contract had been violated. 

I just live in that house now, I’m on awkward terms with the other two, so I read the contract and one of the clauses says only declared tenants can stay for extended periods of time, so I reported that Vera has her boyfriend over, and proved it as the utilities went up in the time I said.

This got me out the contract, however the landlord is evicting Sara and Vera because of this. They said I blindsided them and they will struggle to find a place by the end of this month. My parents live 1.5 hours away so I am moving in with them, but the other two are from a different city so can’t do the same. 

I didn’t intend for them to get evicted, but after the fight over the shower I realised I couldn’t live with them as any issue we have, Vera won’t listen and Sara will stay neutral.",Illustrious_Ice_621,4629,821,0.949999988079071,0.23473553565504665,1723074193,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1emr3xf/aita_for_blindsiding_my_roommates_after_moving_out/,2024,8
1et9pki,AITA For Not Buying My Fiance A Second Wedding Dress That's More than 50% The Total Budget?,"Throwaway Account  
  
My (F49) fiancé (F32) wants me to buy her a new wedding dress that’s over 50% the total wedding budget after I already bought her a $8,600 dress.

I’m marrying the love of my life who is a member of a Native American tribe and lives on a reservation in my city.

I was involved with this tribe before I met her, buying an older woman a mobile home to put on her land when her daughter went to prison leaving her three grandkids to raise when she was living in a 15’ travel trailer. She managed to get the kids out of foster care due to this.

This greased the wheels to get the council to approve us having our wedding on the reservation. I’m paying for everything and have a $60,000 budget. There will be traditional dancers, drummers, and a traditional feast all catered by women on the reservation.  We have an 80 person guestlist—the only people coming on my side is my mother and my adult nephew.

Yes, I’m spreading my money around on the reservation, trying not to be obnoxious about it. Like I said, I’ve seen the poverty many of them go through and I love that my wedding is bringing money there.

My fiancé said she dreamed of her wedding since she was a little girl. I could care less about weddings, tbh, so I’ve let her be the only ‘bride’.  I’m going to wear a black gown with tuxedo elements on top to kind of stand in as a ‘groom’. This way all the attention will be on her. My only rule was that the budget was $60,000 FIRM, not a penny more, and I hired a wedding planner she had to work with to get everything within that budget.

She went out with her girlfriends and decided on a beautiful $8,600 dress. She loved it. It was purchased and fitted. Great.

It’s three months until the wedding (we’re doing November because it’s way too hot to have a summer wedding out here).  She was continuing to get things ready with the tribe and the planner.  One of the tribal elders brought up her dress.  He said she should wear a traditional tribal gown made by one of their artisans.

She sat me down to tell me something ‘serious’ and explained that she couldn’t wear the gown she bought. She needed a traditional tribal gown. I said to get a quote from the artisan and maybe we could get a partial return and/or sell the other gown to cover it.

The artisan’s price? $33,000!! It’s going to be covered with beadwork and she needs to get started NOW.

I said, well it’s a good thing we already have a gown. She said she would not humiliate herself and dishonor her tribe by wearing the wrong gown. I said I can’t approve this cost. It would throw the budget out the window. She says I have millions of dollars, and this is our wedding and I’m being ridiculous.

Yes, I have money. I live off 4% as someone semi-retired. I have this money because I KEEP TO THE BUDGETS I SET.

Now she’s not talking to me except to remind me every day that if the artisan doesn’t start now, she won’t have a dress.

I don’t know what to do. Am I being the asshole here?

He says that through the shirt you can still see them jiggling and the nipple. I said that's insane that I'm supposed to wear a bra just because someone is coming into the house that's a stranger especially because I was fully covered by my shirt there was 0 cleavage showing.

So my(f20) best friend(f22) moved in with me recently because she broke up with her babydaddy, and she needed some time to get back on her feet. I told her she can move in with me if she pays half the rent. She has twins about a year and a half old. I do not get along with her ex at all. He cheated on her multiple times, has no sense of fatherhood hasn’t been there or contributed at all in the twins’ lives. Tried to cheat on her WITH ME, and tried to fight my boyfriend when i rejected him for obvious reasons. Basically my only rule is that the bd is not to be in the apartment because i don’t trust him. He is also known for stealing. 

I left with my mother today around 10am to help clean her house and told my friend I wouldn’t be back until the evening. My mom got tired doing yard work around 1:30pm and she said to call it a day and she took me home early. I come home to see her bd on the couch. My friend comes running out begging for forgiveness that its just for a little bit that he wants to see the babies, he wants to try to work things out. I was like cool. Get out. Go to a hotel or something you know the rules. Im going to the bank, if he’s still here when i come back you can pack your things too bc im over it. She cried really hard to forgive her shes just in a bad spot and doesn’t know what to do. I told her i don’t mind what her decisions are, but i don’t want him in the apartment it was my only rule. You didn’t even try asking me. I went to the bank and they left before i got back. I feel bad for making her cry. Maybe i should have been more calm?

1el1gdf,AITA for ‘excluding’ my BIL’s girlfriend at my anniversary dinner?,"


I 29F and my husband Dan 27M invited close friends and family for dinner and with their kids our guest list was ~30. Most our friends are in long term relationships and we are friends with their partners, but my BIL Sam wanted asked us if he could bring her girlfriend Rose of 1 month to the anniversary dinner. We met Rose once at my In-laws two weeks ago, and I don’t know her well, but I didn’t want BIL to feel excluded at the event as we had invited other SO’s so we said yes. 

Before dinner, we played a quiz where the questions were on us as a couple, some inside jokes and about friends who were there. My MOH made me a video of some recordings from our wedding, and she had contacted other people from our wedding and they had recorded themselves wishing us a happy anniversary. Sam and Rose left earlier than everyone- but we didn’t think this was unusual as Sam mentioned he was working the next day and he was going to leave earlier.

Sam sent my husband a text to say Rose felt excluded at the dinner and it was really awkward for her so they left earlier. He said we could have included her a bit more and the quiz and wedding video was awkward for her and she didn’t understand the quiz jokes and she didn’t come to the wedding.

1f0hhvj,AITA for refusing to buy a bridesmaid's dress until I get closer to my goal weight?,"My (28F) sister “Bri” 29F is getting married a year from now. Recently, she reached out to ask me to be a bridesmaid. I was surprised because Bri and I aren’t super close, but I was happy to be a part of her special day.

I used to be extremely overweight, and last year I decided to take control of my health and lost 75 pounds. I’m much happier and healthier than I was, but I’d still like to lose another 60. This became complicated when Bri sent us a link to the dress she wanted us to buy. I’ve never been a bridesmaid, but apparently it is common for brides to ask their bridesmaids to buy their own dress. Still, the dress she requested costed $300, which seemed pricey to me. Bri has asked us to order the dress within a couple of weeks, as it’s popular and she’s worried it will sell out.

I called Bri and told her I am on a weightloss journey and am not buying clothes, until I get closer to my goal weight unless they’re from Goodwill or Walmart or something. Bri seemed really upset by this–she asked if I could just purchase the size I am now and have it be loose at the wedding. I told her I plan on being almost 60 pounds lighter by the wedding, so the dress won’t be loose–it will literally fall off. Bri asked then if I could slow down my weight loss until after the wedding so the dress would fit. I told her absolutely not. I feel amazing and I’m already losing at a slow and steady pace.

I presented Bri with three solutions: 1–I can wait to buy the dress until closer to the wedding, as I requested, 2–she can buy me the dress now with her money, or 3–I drop out of the bridal party, since she probably has people she’s closer with than me anyway. Bri did not seem keen on any of these options–even removing me from the bridal party. She told me I was ruining her big day and that it’s about her, not me, so why does it matter if I wear a dress that’s a little loose?

I hung up after that to give Bri some time to cool off, but then I got a call from my mother telling me what a horrible sister I was and how selfish I was for not just ordering the bridesmaid’s dress. She reiterated how it’s Bri’s day, not mine, and when I have my own wedding I can do things exactly how I want.

To be truthful, I am finally starting to feel confident and to like how I look. Before I started losing weight, I wouldn’t have cared if I wore a too-loose dress because I was “fat and ugly” anyway. Now, even though I only buy dirt-cheap clothes, I make sure to buy clothes that flatter me and accentuate my curves. I put a lot more effort into hair, makeup, and overall presentation. So yes, even though it is not my wedding, this will probably be the first formal event I go to after having lost weight, and I know lots of pictures will be taken. I want to look my best for these photos because I know I will look back on them and remember how hard I worked to get there. Does this make me a selfish AH?",Artistic-Concert1173,3310,637,0.8600000143051147,0.17111070969114606,1724538803,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f0hhvj/aita_for_refusing_to_buy_a_bridesmaids_dress/,2024,8
1f5yrxy,AITA for making my neighbours think I’m in a cult ,"

Hi throw away account cause I don’t want my friends to find this. I (24M) am a huge fan of board games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons. I host weekly D&D sessions at my apartment with a group of friends, and it's been our tradition for the last five years. We get into it—we dress up, light candles, chant dramatic incantations, we play some ambient music.I know it’s more that the regular player but we like it and find it funny 

Recently, my neighbors (an older couple in their 60s) moved in next door. They’re nice enough, but pretty old-school. Anyway, they’ve been giving me these weird looks lately and avoiding me in the hallway, which I thought was odd. But I figured maybe they just weren’t into socializing.

Well, last Saturday, during one of our sessions, we got *really* into it. My friend Dave (23M) was doing an epic monologue as the evil sorcerer we were about to defeat, and I may have been waving around a fake sword while wearing a hooded cloak, I was cosplaying my rouge character. We were deep in the moment when I heard a knock on the door. 

I opened it, still in costume, and was greeted by my very concerned-looking neighbors. Before I could say anything, the wife blurted out, “We’ve seen the people coming and going, the chanting, the cloaks, the swords—we just want to make sure everything is...okay?”

I was caught off guard and, without thinking, I blurted out, “Oh, we’re just summoning demons. Nothing to worry about!” And then I laughed because, obviously, I was joking.

They did not laugh. In fact, they looked even more horrified. They just mumbled something about being good Christians and backed away slowly.

Fast forward to the next morning, and I find a pamphlet slipped under my door for a “cult deprogramming service.” They even included a handwritten note offering to introduce me to their pastor “to save my soul.”

Now, my friends think this is hilarious and keep suggesting we lean into it, like start wearing robes to take out the trash or chant in the hallways. I’m honestly tempted to mess with them a bit, but I’m also kind of worried I’ve legitimately freaked them out.

She was very upset and asked how I could possibly not love the book and even asked if maybe I was mad at her and telling her I hated the book to be mean. I of course told her that I wasn't mad at her I just didn't like the book that much.

She was still very upset and left saying she needed to be alone for s but.

So I(22F), my partner and six other friends are vacationing around Europe right now. One of our friends, let's say Eren, is still a virgin (22M). I don't care about it, lol, but he is very frustrated regarding this matter. 

So two days ago we were in Budapest clubbing in our hostel when this girl approaches me and my boyfriend and two other friends. She introduces herself (solo traveler), and we invite her to stay with us. Eren is somewhere else. During the night she points at one of my friends, who's in q relationship, and asks whether he s taken or not. I tell her he is and she goes ""I'm not even going to bother, I only like having sex with inexperienced guys"". This girl is physically pretty and fun to be around so I point out Eren and tell her she should hit him up in those case.

We left this morning and two hours ago Eren came humming at me. Apparently he and this girl slept together and texted over the day and she said something along the lines ""glad x told me your a greenie;))""

He is very very mad at me for talking about his private life with strangers (which I swear I did not indent to do), and for making someone to ""pity him"" to have sex.

My boyfriend sides with me (not the most objective source), and so does another of my girl friends, but the rest of the group is being neutral/defensive and kind of ignore me.

That begin said, to bring some more clarification, he never said that he wants to save himself for someone important, wants a meaningfully connection etc. I obviously don't know what happened between them and what she said, but in the morning he stated that he ""finally kicked the ball inside the net"" (it sounds weird translated, lol, but it's a local saying) with a pretty girl. Didn't sound attach or anything, but I wouldn't really know, obviously 

Edit 2: The reason I did not go to Eren in the first place (I'm not saying it's a good reason, but that was what I thought atp) is that he is not peroxide social and has a hard time talking to both men and women. He is shy and I don't think he would have made the first move. But again, I do know I am in the wrong and I will apologize to him as soon as he will want to talk to me again.",Ok-Combination-8439,2177,777,0.8999999761581421,0.1359233230900716,1722724972,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ejg3f2/aitah_for_asking_a_random_girl_to_sleep_with_my/,2024,8

1enjb1v,"AITA for hosting a family friendly BBQ that didn't welcome certain ""family members""","My wife and I finally bought our first house after 10+ years in an apartment.  I hosted a housewarming BBQ for friends and family.  My wife is 5 months pregnant so we weren't about to have a rager. She wants to not be pregnant when we host one of those.  For this party though, we told everyone that this would be a family friendly party.  All ages were welcome.

  
The day of the BBQ, our guests started showing up. For a bit, I was running around with my head cut off and so it took me a while to actually greet everyone.  During this time, my wife came and got me and told me that my buddy Dave brought their dog.  My wife does not like dogs.

    
I go to Dave and his wife, greet them and then I ask why he brought his dog.  He cited the family friendly party and the dog is literally his family. I was told by my wife I just stared at him for a good 10 seconds.  I was processing what he said because I found it a bit crazy. 

  
 I told him what I meant by family, was to bring your human family. I told him it was incredibly rude to assume my house and yard was pet friendly.   So I told him to take the dog home and come back.  He got pissed at me and told me that I needed to specify that some family members were excluded.   I called him crazy for thinking that. He said it was a shame that I was being an asshole because my backyard is great for a dog.  He left and didn't come back. 

  
My friends told me it was unnecessary to kick him out.  I didn't kick him out, i kicked the dog out.  They said the dog is super friendly and well trained and wasn't bothering anyone.  I told everyone I don't care if its the best dog in the world, its not welcome.  AITA?",AmIWrong324956293,2198,552,0.949999988079071,0.12205062626011867,1723156128,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1enjb1v/aita_for_hosting_a_family_friendly_bbq_that_didnt/,2024,8
1evlsno,AITA for standing my ground and not letting my suite-mate take my dorm room?,"For context: Our college randomly assigns suites and rooms to students that apply for dorming. It is not chosen by the students, only the buildings and who they wish to room with. I (19y/o male) am moving to college in the fall. I am in the process of getting to know my suite-mates and roommate since I chose to do random assignment because I had applied late to college and everyone already chose roommates I had to go with first bed open. After I had been assigned a room my actual roommate added me and we began talking. However, he soon blocked me and I could no longer contact him. A week after this happened my suite-mates got in contact with me. They added me and we talked. They then asked me if I happened to know my roommate since he was the only one they hadn’t talked with yet. I said yes but after we talked a bit he blocked me. We then all had the assumption that he would no longer be dorming with us hence the need to block me on instagram. So after much discussion thats the best answer we could come up with as to why he did so. I thought that was the end of that discussion but it seems I would be wrong. One of my suite-mates, lets name him Phineas, would later tell us that we should vote on who got the room. I being confused asked him why since I got the room fair and square by it being assigned to me. He said that he wasn’t aware that the rooms were assigned and that even if they were, we should vote on who gets it anyways since he wanted it. I told him no for a second time and wanted to be over with it. He then told me that he had a girlfriend and that I could understand right? No. I get that shes going to visit every now and then and that it would be nice to have some privacy, especially if they were going to do spicy things, but I already told him that I wanted the room since it was assigned to me and that if he wanted a single he should’ve booked a single. He keeps pushing the matter when I shut him down every time. I told him that if he continues to talk about it, I would go to RA and get in contact with the school about the whole situation and how Phineas wanted to violate explicit rules and guidelines of living in the dorms. For more context: our college does not allow the opposite sex to enter the bedrooms of the student and may only stay in the common area with the suite door open to the hallway. This was a strict rule that even adheres to parents and family. The guy called me a dick and said that I don’t even need it since I am single and would never understand it. My other suite-mate, gonna name him Ferb for the memes, thinks we should see who needs the room more and give it to them. I think that it rightfully belongs to me since I was assigned the room and bed and that if I got so lucky that I didn’t have a roommate anymore than that was my luck and not theirs.

Today, while my wife was at work, I decided to clean out the medicine cabinet. I noticed that there were a lot of medications that were expired and lots of repeats. For example, we had 4 bags of cough drops, 3 bottle of Ibuprofen, etc. I decided to throw away the expired medications and throw away the extras. As I did so, I made a video of the process and pointed out the expiration dates on all of the medications and pointed out the repeats. I videoed myself throwing these items away and explained calmly why these medications needed to be monitored more closely in the future. The video was about 3 minutes long. I then sent the video to my wife so that she could see what I did. I was surprised when she called me back, very upset, asking why I hated her so much. She accused me of trying to shame her and said she couldn't understand why I was being so hateful. She told me that if I had been so concerned about our medication cabinet that I should have been monitoring it on a daily or weekly basis and that if I was that concerned about cleaning out the medicine cabinet, I would have just done it without making a shame video. I told her that I was not attempting to shame her, but rather to inform her. She told me that she showed the video to some of her coworkers, and they agreed with her that I was the asshole.

1ep6q7v,AITA for not allowing my adopted son to choose the movie on family movie night?,"I (45M) have four sons: three biological (17M, 15M, 12M) and one adopted (13M). We adopted Jake, our youngest, when he was 3 years old. He came from a really difficult background, and we’ve always tried to give him as much love and support as possible. But if I’m being honest, it hasn’t been easy.

Jake has always been more of a challenge compared to my other boys. He’s extremely sensitive and gets upset over the smallest things. Due to the trauma he experienced early on, Jake is mentally and emotionally more like an 8- or 9-year-old, even though he’s 13. This isn’t because of any special needs; it’s just the result of what he’s been through. When he was younger, he struggled a lot in school, to the point where he was eventually expelled from his primary school for behavioural issues. It was a really tough time for our family. We ended up enrolling him in a SEMH (Social, Emotional, and Mental Health) school, which costs around £70k per year. While the school has helped him somewhat, Jake still causes a lot of problems. The school often calls us because Jake’s had a meltdown or couldn’t handle something, and it’s clear he needs a lot more attention than our other kids.

At home, Jake’s neediness can be overwhelming. He’s constantly seeking reassurance and gets upset if things don’t go exactly his way. My wife has always been very patient with him, maybe too patient, in my opinion. She tends to cater to his needs a lot more than the other boys, and I can see it’s starting to wear on them. I can tell they’re starting to feel like Jake gets special treatment.

Earlier today, during our usual Saturday family movie night, this issue came to a head. We always vote on the movie to keep things fair. The older boys and I wanted to watch the first Avengers movie. When we voted, Jake was the only one who wanted to watch Spider-Verse instead. Jake loves Spider-Verse, and we’ve watched it several times before.

Seeing how upset Jake was getting, my wife suggested that we just watch Spider-Verse to avoid a meltdown. She felt it wasn’t worth the fight and wanted to keep the peace, especially considering how sensitive Jake is. But I felt like it wasn’t fair to the other boys who had won the vote fairly. I said no, we’re sticking to the movie that won the vote. Jake, predictably, got really upset, stormed off to his room, and refused to come back downstairs.

After the movie, my wife and I had a huge argument. She said I was being too ""harsh"" and that I don’t understand how difficult things are for Jake because of his past. She thinks I should have just let him have his way to avoid the conflict, but I’m tired of walking on eggshells and constantly giving in to Jake at the expense of the other boys.  I don’t think it’s right to let Jake dictate everything just because he’s more sensitive.

AITA for not letting my adopted son choose the movie on family movie night, even though it upset him and led to a huge argument with my wife?

1f59eht,AITA for leaving a family gathering after Mother & Father-in-law allowed their neighbour to make a racist comment?,"I (M 31) am mixed race (Black dad/white Mum) and am currently visiting my mum (60s) and her partner of 10 years (60s white) who we will call 'John'

My mum and John live in a small village in Wales, all white but something I'm fairly used to growing up in predominantly white areas of the UK.

Today I was de-weeding the front garden to help out while visiting, when John bumped into one of the neighbours (Karl 60s) and called me over to introduce myself/say hi. In the very first conversation, I mentioned I'm here for a week from London. Karl immediately led into a story of how when he was last in London he accidentally bumped into a man who proceeded to be extremely hostile and ignored all pleas that it was an accident, becoming more and more belligerent, before adding ""and he was coloured"" in a tone that lowkey screamed ""he was a dangerous n----r"", which both Karl & John chuckled at.

Caught off guard by the comment I immediately said I'm going to finish up on the garden, doing another 30 seconds of work, before putting the tools away and heading to my room. Shortly after John came to my room saying ""Sorry about Karl, he just says it how it is"" which led to me exploding saying ""You don't care about what he said because it doesn't matter to you but it matters to me, and you should care about that"" before leaving to go on a long hike.

Returning a couple of hours later, my mum came to my room in an attempt to resolve the situation.

It didn't go well. Mother began by telling me I'm blowing it out of proportion, that Karl is a weirdo and I should ignore his comments. I made it clear I don't care about Karl, I care that John allowed their neighbour to make a racist remark in front of me with zero pushback.

Mum told me I should have spoken up, I should have stood up for myself. I replied this is your friend, it's not my responsibility to correct them, and as a person of colour it is not my responsibility to educate every racist white person.

My Mum told me I'm overreacting, to which I told her she's white, she has no idea the experience of being a person of colour, & has no business telling me what is or isn't racist, or how I should feel. I've been forced to turn a blind eye to racism in my social life, in the workplace, in education & while working abroad, I am not going to accept racism in a place I call home, and that I'm packing my bag and going home tomorrow morning.

My mum is furious I'll be missing seeing the rest of the family, and believes I'm immature for not continuing to discuss the matter as a family and at least find a place to agree to disagree. I don't know what more there is to discuss, I don't know what compromise or level of racism I'm expected to tolerate, or how I'm supposed to be comfortable in the knowledge that my direct family are comfortable ignoring racism and minimalise my feeling towards it.

So, am I the asshole?",No_Fan_9448,2335,191,0.949999988079071,0.10383470305375452,1725060615,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f59eht/aita_for_leaving_a_family_gathering_after_mother/,2024,8

But the wedding requires women and girls to wear dresses so she will have to wear one to the wedding. 

I told her this and she was not happy, she said she didn't want to wear a dress. I tried telling her we would go shopping for one together and I would take her out to lunch first and make sure she got one that was very cute and comfortable. 


She rejected it and said "" I don't wanna wear a stupid dress ""! I then told her it was required to attend the wedding and if she didn't wear a dress we would have to leave her with a babysitter while the rest of the family went to the wedding.

1f3ob84,AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding because she didn’t invite me to hers?,"
So, some background: My sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. We’re not super close, but we’ve always managed to stay cordial, mainly because of family gatherings and events. A few years ago, she got married, and I wasn’t invited. She claimed it was a small ceremony with only her husband’s family and a few close friends. I was hurt, but I didn’t make a big deal out of it and let it go.

Fast forward to now—I’m getting married. My fiancé and I are planning a slightly larger wedding with close family and friends. When it came time to send out invitations, I decided not to invite my sister. I felt like if she didn’t want me at her wedding, I shouldn’t feel obligated to invite her to mine. 

My parents are furious and say I’m being petty and that I should be the bigger person. They insist that I invite her because “family is family.” But to me, it’s more about reciprocation and not wanting someone at my wedding who didn’t think I was important enough to be at theirs. My fiancé supports my decision but thinks it might cause unnecessary drama. 

Now, my sister found out she wasn’t invited and called me, upset. She said she didn’t invite me to her wedding because she was under a lot of stress at the time and regrets it now. She accused me of holding a grudge and ruining our relationship even further. 

I feel like I’m justified in my decision, but now I’m second-guessing myself. AITA for not inviting her?

1f4g33i,AITA for Calling an Ambulance for My Drunk Wife Who Passed Out in a Club Bathroom?,"Last Saturday night, my wife (30F) and I (30M) went to a concert with a friend who recently moved to our city. My wife had been recovering from a cold and was excited to go out, as it had been a while since we had a night out together. I drove, so I only had one beer, but my wife and our friend kept drinking throughout the night.

As the gig went on, I noticed my wife having more drinks and getting quite drunk, but she was having so much fun that I didn’t want to ruin it. Toward the end of the concert, my wife went to the bathroom. When the gig finished, our friend and I waited for her outside, but after 20 minutes with no sign of her and unanswered calls, we started to worry. 

We showed a picture of my wife to someone leaving the bathroom, and a woman told us she had seen my wife passed out in a toilet cubicle, covered in her own vomit and unresponsive. My heart sank. I had never seen her like this before, and I was genuinely scared for her safety. The staff came to help and strongly suggested calling an ambulance. I agreed immediately, fearing alcohol poisoning or a spiked drink.

The paramedics arrived and took my wife to the emergency department. I drove there and arrived shortly after the ambulance. Thankfully, she came around a few hours later, and the doctor said she was fine, just extremely drunk. The next day, my wife was able to laugh at the whole thing but felt that I overreacted by calling the ambulance. She said it was unnecessary and that the whole experience was traumatizing and embarrassing.

I explained to her that I was following the advice of the venue staff and was genuinely worried something more serious could have happened, like choking on her vomit. It’s been a few days, and she still insists I shouldn't have called an ambulance. We have private healthcare that covers ambulance costs, so that wasn’t an issue, but I’m starting to question if I did overreact.

1epxmtk,AITAH for not babysitting for my cousin last minute?,"I am 20f and my cousins wife, “Nora,” is 38f. I received a text from her yesterday asking if I could babysit her 1yo baby today because she was to be having fibroid removal surgery. My cousin “Jack,” 36m was to be driving her and was staying at the hospital. The surgery was supposed to be this fall, but they told her last minute that they had an opening for her today. In the message she told me that money is currently very tight between her and my cousin, so they would not be able to pay me. This would have been fine and I would have accepted, had I not been scheduled to work. She would have needed me there at 7am and my shift was 6am-noon. 

So I politely told her I could not babysit. She never responded. I went downstairs after this exchange and my mom asked “so what time are you babysitting?” I told her I was not, I have work. She told me I was so rude to not call off for Nora and that she was disappointed in my behavior. I asked her why she didn’t call off work to watch Nora’s baby if it was so important to her. She basically told me I was a brat and that I know her job is a “real job.” I work in food service. She knows I work and that I take my job seriously. I’m working to pay for school and both me and my boyfriend are saving every penny to hopefully move in together within the next year. She called me a few other rude names and is now not speaking to me. 

She also must have told some of my other family members about the situation. I’ve now received 2 texts, including one from my grandma, about how I should be willing to do anything for my family and that I need to “make exceptions for family.” I’m annoyed at the whole situation. 

As for Nora, I do feel bad that she was stressed looking for a last minute babysitter on top of having surgery and I don’t know what she ended up doing.

1eocq8l,AITA for buying locks and a mini fridge in my room?,"I (16f) am the oldest in my family. I have 8 younger siblings age 12, 10, 9, 9, 6, 4, 4, and 2. privacy is very hard to come by around here. Luckily, I only share a room with one person (12f), but I might as well share with everyone because my siblings come barging in every five minutes and snoop through my things, especially when I’m not home. 

I have some very expensive makeup and hair products that I keep stashed in my drawer. Last week, the 4yo twins came in and smashed or emptied half the items. I have special editions of books, and 10f came in and rumpled some pages a few days ago. And my friend made me some traditional food from her culture, which I put in the fridge (LABELED) up high, and somehow my siblings ignored it and ate it yesterday. Things like this happen all the time, and the only one who doesn’t do this kind of thing is 12. 

I’ve spoken to my parents about things like this, but they always say it’s part of having siblings and I need to put my things away better or learn to share, since they’re only little. The thing is, I do put my things away, and they still go through my entire room to find them. So I gave up and I bought a door lock and Childs locks for my drawers, as well as a mini fridge (I am going to share the fridge with 12 because I know she won’t eat the food I put in there). I put the lock on the door and locked my drawers and bookcases yesterday. 

My parents didn’t even notice, they apparently found out after a bunch of kids came crying to them about how ‘they can’t get in my room to use my cool things’. When I came home from work today, they confronted me about how I shouldn’t shut my siblings out. I told them if they knocked on the door and asked me to use my things, I would probably say yes. But since they don’t know how to do that and instead sneak in when I’m not home, I was going to keep the locks on to protect my stuff. 12 also told me she likes the door lock too. 

But my parents are angry because I never asked them, and again, I’m ‘shutting my siblings out’. They’re punishing me by not letting me leave the house except work/school for the next month, but they can’t take the locks off because I bought them with my own money.

1f0h4cs,AITA for refusing to give back the laptop my mother gave me to punish younger sister,"I (23f) am starting grad school this year. My laptop recently broke and I couldn't afford a good one, my mother said my little sister (16f) has been ""acting up"" recently and not listening and she'd like to give me her laptop since ""she's been horrible lately.""

Now my mother tends to spoil her so it is her fault my sister turned out this way (ofcourse she'll hear none of it), she has a bad habit of not following through on punishments and ""canceling"" them when my sister pitches enough of a fit. 

I asked my mom ""are you absolutely sure you aren't going to call me later and ask for it back when she pitches a fit? Because if I'm gifted this I'm not giving it back unless you buy me one of equal or greater value."" She said ""yes I'm sure I've had enough of her antics"" so I went over and picked up the laptop when sister wasn't home and that was that or so I thought. 

It only took about a day before my mother called me begging for the laptop back because my sister has become unbearable and I said ""are you going to buy me one of equal or greater value?"" And she just kept begging for me to bring it back she couldn't stand it anymore, I told her no she never follows through on disciplining sister and its her fault the way she turned out its about time she followed through on a consequence and I'm not giving it back we had this discussion, and it's her fault for dragging me into this in the first place. She then screams at me and hung up and now won't speak to me. 

Dad always gives into whatever mom wants ""happy wife happy life"" and is telling me to ""be the bigger person"" and give it back, and I said I'm sticking to my guns and he's sent me several nasty texts and emails because now mom is on his case and he can't stand it and he's saying it's all my fault and this had just hugely blown up.

1f57hzw,AITA for telling my son he needs to learn to get along with other students? ,"Our son(13M) went to the same elementary school as many of his friends. We moved away to another section of the city because my mom was very sick and it allowed us to take care of her without driving 40 min each way. She needed to be checked on frequently and so we did it for her so she didn’t need to go to a nursing home. But we didn’t think it would affect our son so much. My son is very gifted in math and engineering and is probably the typical nerdy kid. Things were fine when he was in the equally nerdy elementary school. Parents specially go to that school district because of the full AP and IB high school and the property values in the neighborhood makes the schools there have special programs and after school programs. There was a robotics program for their middle school which I don’t believe is offered elsewhere. 

My mom passed 3 months ago and as we live nearby we are going to be renoing the home ourselves and moving in to live nearby which will take probably a year before selling. My old sister is in Europe so I don’t have other family help in this. The problem is my son has been complaining about bullying with the school year starting he wants to go back to the original school district. My wife wants us to go back (as we sold our house at the peak and are currently renting) and rent there so he can go back while we travel 40 min each way to reno after we both work full time. 

It also means adding the cost of renting while we need to travel back and forth. My wife wants us to hire professionals and just deduct that from the sale of my mom’s house. I feel like one more year isn’t a lot to put up with but my son doesn’t want to go back to this school when he normally enjoys school. He says the other kids make fun of him because my wife packs him meals. They bully him for everything according to him. The school he is registered to near my mom’s house is more in a rough area. I don’t think it means it’s bad but he hates it and cannot seem to relate to the other students. 

I don’t want him to be privileged and live in a bubble but my wife who also moved from a more normal school district to a more affluent and “gifted” school said it was more fun to be where other kids take academic seriously and didn’t make fun of her for liking it. I have sat my son down and told him that life means he needs to deal with environments he isn’t use to and it’s better for us (as a family and for our finances) to wait until we sold the house and can more back next year. He got angry and said he never wanted to move and I said it was for grandma and he argued grandma passed so we should move back and I said he should try to get along with the other students and the fact he cannot is on him. He refused to talk to me all week and refused to go back to school shopping which is normally his favourite time of year.

1ezotps,AITA for refusing to switch to another stylist during my haircut?,"

So this happened recently, and I’m still wondering if I was in the wrong.

I had an appointment with my usual hairstylist and was already in the chair with my haircut underway. While I was getting my hair cut, some guy walked in without an appointment and started talking to my hairstylist. The stylist explained that he was busy cutting my hair and mentioned that I was also getting my beard done afterward.

Despite this, the guy kept pleading with the stylist to squeeze him in. Eventually, my stylist asked me if I would be willing to move to another stylist so he could help this walk-in guy out. I didn’t feel comfortable switching stylists mid-cut, so I politely said no.

The guy got upset and called me an @sshole saying I was being unreasonable and selfish. I didn’t think I was in the wrong but he made a huge deal about it.
