1k5jzjb,AITA for refusing to cover my tattoos for my boyfriend‚Äôs family dinner?,"I‚Äôm (21F) a girl who has several tattoos (some big and quite visible), my boyfriend (26M) met me like that and I hadn't had any problem with it.  
He invited me to go to dinner with his family and I accepted, but he casually mentioned, ‚ÄúMaybe you could wear something with sleeves? Just so we don‚Äôt start any drama.‚Äù I asked what he meant, and he said his grandparents are very old-school and might not react well to my tattoos. He said he didn‚Äôt want the night to be awkward.  
I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to hide part of myself to make his family more comfortable. He said it‚Äôs not about hiding, it‚Äôs about respect. I told him respect goes both ways, and I shouldn‚Äôt have to pretend to be someone I‚Äôm not.  
He got upset and said I was overreacting and making it a bigger deal than it is. I told him that I would go to the dinner but that I wouldn't cover my tattoos. But then he asked me to please not attend, that if I was only going to be difficult, it would be better not to be there.  
That really rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel confused, because I think maybe I did behave badly and I shouldn't have reacted so vehemently against the idea. I don't want to cause drama with his family, but I have had a hard time feeling comfortable in my skin and learning to deal with the stigma people have towards me because of my tattoos... and I don't want to go back and hide again, plus I don't think I would be honest with his family either if I show myself as I am not.

So... AITA for refusing to cover my tattoos for the dinner?",IrinaVibe08,8027,3207,0.8500000238418579,0.7805662355819644,1745362216,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5jzjb/aita_for_refusing_to_cover_my_tattoos_for_my/,2025,4
1k9g8wn,AITA for not taking down my yard flamingos after neighbors complained?,"I bought a house a couple years ago and I have been working on making it look nicer. I spent a lot of time redoing the front gardens, trying to make it neat and nice. 

I a few weeks ago was at a greenhouse buying some plants for the garden and I saw two yard flamingos marked down on clearance. I knew they belonged in my garden. They‚Äôre not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but I think they‚Äôre a lot of fun. 

I set them up when I got home and a couple days later my neighbor was knocking on my door. She was demanding I take down my flamingos because they‚Äôre ‚Äúextremely gauche‚Äù and ‚Äúlowering the property value of the neighborhood‚Äù. I told her I am not taking them down because I like them, and the property value isn‚Äôt going to be hurt by two yard flamingos. I also don‚Äôt live in an HOA and as far as I am aware, there are no town ordinances about yard flamingos lol

She has posted pictures of my house, the street I live on, and a close up of my flamingos in our towns Facebook group to complain about them. Some people agreed I should take them down. After that, another neighbor came over to tell me to get rid of them. My mom also agreed I should take them down to keep the peace with my neighbor. 

I like them, I smile when I see them when I pull into my driveway. I have no plans to take them down. 

AITA for not taking down my yard flamingos after some neighbors complained?

1jzb2tl,AITA - told mom she can bill me using the tuition money she stole from me,"When I (m33) was preparing to go to uni, my mom confessed that there was no tuition money for me. Through the years my dad would give her cash to deposit but she only did the first one. She spent the rest. TBH I wasn't even surprised. I was used to being disappointed by her. She promised that she would ""pay me back"" and asked that I never tell me dad. So for four years I thanked them for the tuition money while I took out loans.

For reasons to do with her narcissism, I have an arms length relationship with her, but she would say we're pretty close as she assumes my smiling and nodding while she drones on about the same stories is a relationship.

We have a family cottage that she puts above everything else. She lives there about 90 days of the year. I've been going there with my gf for about 4 days for a couple summers which she begrudges as it takes away from her time. My dad supports my going which is how I pull it off. 

She recently told me that it was time for me to start paying for some of the maintenance on the cottage since I use it. She actually suggested 1k which is wildly disproportionate. I told her she could take it out of the tuition IOU and we could negotiate the amount with dad.

She was speechless. She texted me later to say that it manipulative to bring up the tuition and to threaten to tell dad. It went on and on. 

I've been thinking about it and First, I'm hurt/offended that she can't just do a nice thing for me, she has to get something for it. 
Second, I guess I'm not really over the whole tuition thing. 

WITAH for bringing up ancient history and not paying her for use of the cottage?

Edited to add: at the time, it never occurred to me that I should have told him. I thought I was doing the right thing by protecting both of them. That pretty much summarizes my childhood.

1jyksrp,AITA for yelling at a 19 year old and asking for him to be fired?,"Throwaway account. I (37M) and my husband (39M) have been together 11 years. My husband owns a small bookshop and recently has hired a boy to help him. This lad (I'll call him Joe) is gay and while me and my husband very obviously have no issue with this, Joe seems to do things a lot differently to us. For context both me and my husband are Irish immigrants to London. We grew up a 20 minutes away from each other and went to the same, very Catholic, school. We aren't exactly flamboyant or outwardly 'gay' and don't exactly do PDA since that's how we were raised. On my lunch break from work I like to visit my husband bringing him records I think he might like and his coffee. Recently however Joe has started making comments. It started small with him saying things about'queer joy' and how he loves gay couples which we didn't mind at all, in all fairness it's a fairly scary world for queer people right now and I understand seeing a happy married gay couple means a lot for a kid. But then he started getting a little too comfortable for my liking. He started asking things like 'whose the top' and calling us the f slur jokingly. I think it's entirely inappropriate to be making those comments to his boss but my husband told me to let it go. Joe calls us the f slur a lot which I had brought up a few times telling him calmly to not do that but when he continued I learnt to let go despite my distaste for it since it didnt seem to bother my husband too much but last Wednesday I lost it. 
I was up by the counter when Joe came in. He immediately started blathering on about how f---y we are and while my husband chuckled awkwardly,I did not. Joe noticed this and said I was a stick in the mud and repressed. I was trying to keep my cool until he called me 'a fenian f---t' and I lost it. For anyone who doesn't know the term 'Fenian' isnt exactly a slur or anything but it isn't exactly nice either. Me and my husband jokingly call each other fenians or paddy's from time to time if weve something particularly 'Irish' and I've never exactly viewed as a very offensive word to me but something about this English boy made me snap. I asked him if he thought that was an appropriate thing to say to his boss's partner and started shouting. Telling him hes way out of play and if he wants to keep his job he should buck up. I left to cool down a bit and 30 minutes later got a call from my husband berating me saying that Joe was crying and that hes just a kid. I do feel really bad since hes only young but I still think he needed to be knocked down a step or two, am I the asshole?

Edit: I see a lot of people making comments about the nature of the relationship between Joe and my husband, my husband has asked Joe to stop on my behalf before but this isn't something that really bothers my husband and to be fair it's his workplace not mine.


Update: Joe is my husbands son.
I won't go too much into the details for both my and their privacy but I had a major fight with my husband about why he was being so lenient with him and why we didn't have my back in this. We were shouting back and forth until he shouted something about 'blood being thicker than water' I shout back about him being just some boy and he stopped suddenly. Then he told me. Joe is from an ex girlfriend of his whose now unable to take care of him so my husband picked up. He's been playing child support for years. We each have our separate bank account so I didn't even notice. I'm contemplating separation and divorce. Someone I've known for 25 years became a stranger in 10 seconds. 
I physically got sick thinking back on those sexual remarks that he made to his FATHER. My husband alsways went white as a ghost when he said those kinds of things and that was possibly the only thung he actually gave out to him for but it makes me feel sick all the same",Adventurous-Dog-5299,6544,962,0.8999999761581421,0.3787156219677181,1744586124,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jyksrp/aita_for_yelling_at_a_19_year_old_and_asking_for/,2025,4
1k6aqqe,AITA for sitting on a woman‚Äôs purse on the train?,"I live in a metropolitan city and the train I take home from work is crowded since everyone is also getting off work. There have been many occasions where other passengers on the train will occupy the empty seat next to them with their bag. There are people standing during the ride when there are available seats. 

I walked multiple cars to try to find an empty seat (without a bag) but couldn‚Äôt. The last car I went to I asked this woman if I could sit there and she pretended to not hear me. I didn‚Äôt want to tap her shoulder because you never know how people would react so I waved a bit to get her attention and she said she didn‚Äôt want to hold her bag (which was a no). I told her I couldn‚Äôt find any other empty seat and I had already walked the entire train and it‚Äôs leaving soon. She ignored me again. I asked if she could move her bag and she still ignored me. I ended up just sitting in the seat on her purse. 

She began yelling at me telling me I‚Äôm a b!tch and told me to move because she never said I could sit there. I told her that there was no other seat and the train was departing. She began pushing me to move and the conductor luckily came by them and told her to relax. She told him that I touched her purse and he asked if it was occupying a seat and she didn‚Äôt reply. He ended up telling her to be considerate and left to check tickets. 

When the train stop came she said she‚Äôs going to report me to the police for touching her belongings and said I‚Äôm inconsiderate for invaliding her personal space because she had a rough day at work and wanted personal space. I told her that it was still inconsiderate when many people are looking for seats. She said they should‚Äôve been there early enough go get empty seats (this was 9 minutes before departure). 

I‚Äôm a woman for reference so it‚Äôs not like she was simply uncomfortable sitting next to a man. ",CyclingSkater,6663,728,0.9399999976158142,0.34639231269155524,1745443190,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k6aqqe/aita_for_sitting_on_a_womans_purse_on_the_train/,2025,4
1k9gy15,AITA for not eating the birthday cake my boyfriend got me?,"  Alright so my birthday was a couple days ago and I asked my boyfriend like a week before to get me a carrot cake. While I know its not a popular choice for a birthday cake, it's my favourite and practically the only flavour of cake I like (besides red velvet but I wasnt feeling it tbh.) Keeping in mind that I was gonna have a birthday party with my friends, my boyfriend suggested that I get a ""flavour that people like"", which I'd understand maybe if it was a huge party with tons of people, but I know my friends and I know they wouldn't  mind carrot cake at all. 

  Anyways fast forward to my birthday, my boyfriend goes and gets the cake from the shop in the afternoon and I dont get to see it since im getting ready, but he doesn't mention anything to me about it, so i think nothing of it since i like a surprise. My friends arrive and everything's going great until its time for the cake to be served. We gather around the table and everyone sings happy birthday while my boyfriend brings out the cake, and to my horror, i see this big chocolate cake in his hands. I hate chocolate cake. It makes me sick. He KNOWS I hate chocolate cake. 

  My face fell when I saw it but I obvs didnt say anything at the time. However, I did give my bf a glare or two, which he clearly picked up on since he kept insisting I eat the cake infront of everyone as we were serving it out. Something about that made me angry in the moment and I refused to try the cake at all. I cut it, i blew out the candles, I handed it out to eberyone, but i didn't try it myself. 

  I dont think the others took huge notice but once the party ended i started getting unready when my boyfriend comes into our room and is lile ""why do you have to act like a child all the time??"" And im like what the hell and hes like ""you have to make a scene just cos i didn't get your fucking carrot cake"" and he went on about how nobody likes carrot cake and how im spoiled and selfish and looked stupid not eating cake at my own birthday and then claimed he couldnt find carrot cake which is crazy cos 1. Ive never not gone to that shop and NOT seen carrot cake, and 2. even if there wasnt any he coulda picked ANY other flavour, besides the only one I hate. 

 I told him that and he just got really upset like I was the one who started the fight and started going on abt how I was overreacting over cake and how he tried his best to make this bday good for me (which in fairness is true since he put a lot of effort into organising it for me) but honestly I was just livid then. Now we're still kinda off about it and neither of us have lile apologised or anything but im starting to think i did overreact over cake and I probably shoulda just eaten it and then talked tochim later but idk üò≠

1k8ox5z,AITA for not picking the restaurant my cousin wanted?,"I (25f) just recently received a great promotion at work and I‚Äôm really excited about it. Because of this I decided to invite some family out to dinner to celebrate. I chose a steakhouse and when my cousin, Aria (32f) found out it was a steakhouse called me to let me know that I had to pick a different restaurant. When I asked why she explained it was because she was vegan, gluten-free, and also has a few allergies and couldn‚Äôt trust that they wouldn‚Äôt cross-contaminate her food. I explained to her that there were vegan and gluten free options and we could let the restaurant know of her allergies so everything would be fine. She refused saying it doesn‚Äôt make a difference and told me if I don‚Äôt pick a different restaurant she wouldn‚Äôt attend and hung up.


This has happened in the past as well, whenever I want to go out to a restaurant whether it‚Äôs for an event or a birthday she has an issue with it and has been doing this since I was younger. I remember when I turned 16 she told my parents that I had picked a restaurant she couldn‚Äôt eat at. Because of this my parents let her pick where we went for my birthday and she picked one of my least favourite restaurants and I had no fun. 

To be honest, I don‚Äôt really care if she attends or not so I texted her and let her know that I wouldn‚Äôt be changing the restaurant. Because of this shes been going absolutely feral and texting others to not attend because I‚Äôm being inconsiderate. I‚Äôve been asked if maybe I can change the restaurant for her preferences but I denied.

1jvjdip,AITA for refusing to be my sister‚Äôs bridesmaid because she chose ‚Äúugly friends‚Äù to make herself look better?,"My sister (27F) is getting married and asked me (24F) to be one of her bridesmaids.

It felt weird, so I asked her why she picked this group. She kind of laughed and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand when it‚Äôs your wedding. You don‚Äôt want people who‚Äôll outshine you in your own pictures.‚Äù

I just stared at her. I asked, ‚ÄúSo you picked them because you think they‚Äôll make you look better?‚Äù She rolled her eyes and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that deep. I just want to feel confident that day, and I‚Äôm allowed to be a little selfish for my wedding.‚Äù

That rubbed me the wrong way. I told her I didn‚Äôt want to be part of a bridal party built on tearing other people down ‚Äî even subtly ‚Äî and that she should‚Äôve picked people she actually cares about.

I go on business trips for work around 3-4 times a year. In a week I'm going to Florida.

Yesterday I was talking on the phone with my mom. I had told her about my business trip and how I my wife and daughter‚Äôs were going. She mentioned something about K staying with her.

1k7znn0,AITA for not inviting my nephew to my sons birthday party?,"I (35f) have a son, Cillian (14m) who just recently had a birthday. The issue stems from his birthday from last year, where we invited all his cousins and his friends to celebrate him. The party went great for the first half, but when it came time to cut the cake I went over to fridge to go get it and saw it was half eaten. I was obviously upset about this because this had been a cake that I had made by a professional baker that cost me around $140 and my son really loved the design.

I asked who ate the cake and my sister (44f) laughed it off when her son, Robbie, (16m) told her that he ate the cake because he was hungry. To be clear the cake wasn‚Äôt the only food at the party, throughout the party we served many different dishes such as wings, veggie platters, pizzas, chips, and sodas. I was obviously angry that my son couldn‚Äôt have his cake and had to quickly go out and by one from Walmart. I‚Äôm honestly still shocked that with all the food at the party Robbie still managed to clear half of a huge cake, it was enough to produce about 20 slices.

I called my sister later to tell her I wasn‚Äôt happy with what her son had done and since I had spent so much money on the cake I expected it back. She then accused me of being fat phobic which absolutely is not true, I have never once discriminated against Robbie at any time, this was just a false accusation. To explain, Robbie has a weight problem and has been having issues with binging since he was around 13 which is why he is about 250 pounds and my sister has never failed to let anyone know of that and expects for everyone to bend over backwards for Robbie since he has it hard. 

This year Cillian wanted to have a friends only party with the exception of 2 cousins, one that only his friends and closest cousins could come to since he hated his party from last year. I asked why and he explained to me that he was embarrassed of Robbie since all he did was poke fun at his friends and him, bring his own uninvited plus one, and obviously he ate some of the cake. 

I complied and only invited his friends and allowed 2 of his cousins to join as well. Luckily some of my siblings were understanding, the only one who had an issue with this was my sister. She called me to ask why Robbie wasn‚Äôt invited and I explained to her that Cillian doesn‚Äôt want him there because of what he did last year, my sister was infuriated and said she knew we had an issue with her sons weight.

I really like Jeremy, they were friends before they started dating, so I met and got close to him before he started dating my mom. I think he‚Äôs really cool and I am happy for my mom. 

My issue is with his annoying and arrogant son, he is only 2 years older than me but acts like he‚Äôs too cool to hang out with me. He treats me like a little kid but there‚Äôs only 2 years between us.

I will call him Dean. Dean is deaf, and has to use a device (it‚Äôs called cochlear implants) to hear. But he can‚Äôt wear his device all the time because apparently hearing can be exhausting for him. Tbh I think this is an excuse he uses to avoid hanging out with us. But that‚Äôs what he claims.

1jxqsks,"AITA for not inviting my dad‚Äôs partner to my micro ‚Äúwedding‚Äù dinner, and for not reaching out to her first to explain why?","Using a throwaway to not connect this to my main.

My partner and I are getting married this summer, and we‚Äôve decided to essentially elope. We‚Äôre going to have a private ceremony just the two of us during our honeymoon. Not only does this align very much with who we are, so no one in our life is very surprised by this, but we‚Äôre also doing it because: 1. our families live scattered across the world and a larger event would mean leaving a lot of people out, and 2. We want to avoid drama.

However, what we do want to do is get dressed up, take photos, and have a dinner together with our immediate families. So essentially, a micro non-wedding celebration. This is where the issues start.

So I told my parents I wanted to have this small event with just them, my partner, and my sister (not including their ‚Äúnew‚Äù partners). My parents went through a nasty divorce when I was in my teens, and for several reasons that I explained to them I wanted an intimate event just the five of us. My mom was fully supportive, saying she can understand why this would be so meaningful for me.

My dad understood too. But he wanted me to be the one to break the news to his partner (54F). I didn‚Äôt think I had to, because it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm calling everyone single other family member who isn‚Äôt invited to explain this decision. But I said that if she‚Äôs upset she‚Äôs more than welcome to call me and we can talk about it. His partner is very sensitive, and we‚Äôve clashed a lot over the years because I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever been fully willing to understand the nuances of coming into a family after a divorce. Their relationship started shortly after the divorce, and she tried to parent both my sister and I (who were teens/pre-teens) from the get-go. But even though we‚Äôre not close, I‚Äôve done my best to otherwise be welcoming and kind.

Well, now he‚Äôs told her and all hell has broken lose. She‚Äôs completely beside herself, and he wants me to mitigate the issue and reach out. I‚Äôve reiterated that she‚Äôs free to call me - if she can‚Äôt possibly understand why this is about me and not her (and I can understand she‚Äôs disappointed, but so is, I assume, everyone else) then she should reach out to me.

AITA for not inviting her, and for not breaking the news to her, and for refusing to be the first person to reach out here to resolve this? I can kind of see my dad's point, who says I should be extra mindful of her since she is a sensitive person who has had a hard time accepting we're not very close and takes this personally.

1k5hmpj,WIBTA for telling my boyfriend's parents I'm not his babysitter?,"I 23f have been dating my boyfriend Josh 29m for 2 years. We live together as well. Recently, his parents have started asking me to get him to do things. ""Make sure Josh to go to the dentist for his cracked tooth."" or ""Make sure Josh updates his passport."" or ""Make sure Josh changes his pet food for his cat. We don't like the brand."" Or ""Make sure Josh does his taxes. You may need to sit with him and help."" The most recent has been convincing Josh to get a new job in an entirely unrelated field because Josh's parents don't feel like he makes enough money. (Josh makes 70k, I make 110k so we are doing fine.)  

Typically I respond with some variation of ""I'm fully capable Josh can figure it out himself, and if not, it will be a good learning experience for him."" but that hasn't stopped Josh's parents. Now I'm planning on being a little harsher and telling them I'm not Josh's babysitter and to leave me out of these concerns.

WIBTA for saying that? Is there anything else I should do differently?

TL;DR Boyfriend's parents want me to make sure he does normal adult tasks. I feel it is not my job.

1jzd7j8,AITA for listening to music in the car my husband doesn't like after a concert?,"This weekend, my teen daughter and I went to see Megan Moroney. My husband wanted to come along even though I told him it could be just a girls night with my daughter and I. He insisted on going because he didn't want us to be out late by ourselves, even though he does not care for Megan's music.

So my daughter and I enjoy the concert so much! She was so excited she almost cried from pure joy. Everything was great, concert ended, we go to our vehicle.

My daughter and I are still having a good time, kind of on a post-concert high. I turn one of Megan moroney's songs on and we start singing along. My husband abruptly turns it off. At first I thought, ok maybe he just wants some peace as he drives but he says ""turn it on something else!"" I said ""why, we were listening to that?"" He said ""well I don't want to"" or someone like that and starts complaining about how awful megan moroney is and how her songs are all man-bashing, etc. I said ""whoa buddy we told you that it could just be a girls night like you insisted on coming!"" So we ride home in silence and my daughter is really disappointing. One of our favorite things to do is turn the music on and sing along in the car.

AITA for wanting to listen to my music after a concert he didn't even want to be at?

1kbt483,AITA for winning my mom‚Äôs storage unit at auction instead of giving her the money to save it herself?,"I (24F) was in and out of the foster care system. My mom would lose custody of me and my three siblings, only to do the bare minimum to get us back, just for the cycle to repeat. I eventually aged out of foster care, went to college, and moved to another state. I still check in with my mom every week. She was diagnosed with heart failure. (which came on from other terrible decisions). I offer support when she reaches out, whether it's with money, food etc. Most of the time I don't hear back. And when I do, it's usually because she wants something. She has a long history of lying to and stealing from all of us. She's currently homeless. We have offered her a place to stay if she gets clean and she wont. After we turned 18, we reconnected with our extended family, grandparents, and cousins, and those relationships have become important to us. A couple of months ago, she called me in a panic at 2:00 in the morning. She said her storage units were about to be auctioned off, that she wasn't even behind on payments, and that the owners were trying to scam her.
She needed $1,000 immediately because there were only 15 hours left before the auction. I told her l'd check in the morning once I got to work and see what I could do. The next day, I did some digging and looked at the contents of the storage units. What was listed broke my heart: family photos, vases from great-grandparents, personal documents (birth certificates, Social Security cards, my mom's clothing and tools, and everything from my grandmother's house (she passed away just last year). I decided to bid on the unit myself and ended up spending nearly $1,200 for it. Afterward, I spoke to the owners, who told me they'd been trying to help my mom for months: discounts, payment extensions etc. But eventually, she just stopped answering them. They said they had no other option but to auction it. I was devastated. My siblings said that if I hadn't stepped in, all of those memories and important documents would've ended up in a stranger's hands. My siblings were relieved and grateful... but my mom? She accused me of violating her trust, told me l ""emotionally robbed her"" , that I stole from her, and said I was a mistake. She even claimed our grandparents would be ashamed of me. I ended up taking a few days off work, drove out of state to the unit, and went through everything. I only kept what belonged to me and my siblings-photos, documents, anything tied to our family history. I didn't throw away a single item of hers. Instead, I rented a new storage unit just down the road, moved all her belongings there, and paid three months in advance. I gave her all the info. Now I'm stuck with this heavy feeling. I can't shake the guilt, like l crossed a line or sank to her level somehow. But at the same time, I couldn't bear to see everything important to us vanish, especially knowing it would probably happen again in six months.

1kb0w6d,AITAH for telling my grandma she can‚Äôt wear blue at my wedding?,"PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE THING!

My (24F) fiance (25M) are getting married in June and we‚Äôve invited our families, obviously. The colors we chose are light blue, tan, and navy blue. For a little bit of context, my parents went through a horrible divorce when I was 13. My dad‚Äôs mom (the grandma I‚Äôm talking about) was VERY hateful to my mom and just outright disrespectful to her so I‚Äôm not her biggest fan. She‚Äôs always gone against the rules and done whatever she‚Äôs wanted to with no repercussions. She enables my dad who is an addict and she knows it‚Äôs wrong (not important but just trying to set the scene). It‚Äôs a little awkward going to family gatherings on my dad‚Äôs side because I feel like the black sheep of the family. My sister (33F) is my half sister on my dad‚Äôs side, we‚Äôve become closer through the years. 
My grandma called me about 2pm today and we talked about wedding stuff and she asked me what I wanted her to wear. I told her I wasn‚Äôt picky, just no white and no light blue. 

Later today, my sister and my grandma went to JCPenny to shop. My sister found a dress she loved, it‚Äôs also important to note my sister is a bridesmaid in my wedding. They are wearing light blue. My grandma sees the dress and loves it as well saying it would be perfect for the wedding. However, she meant for herself. Not for my sister. My grandma bought a light blue (almost white) dress to wear to our wedding. My sister told me about it, as she thought my grandma had bought the dress for her and didn‚Äôt realize that she bought it for herself (my sister is not the brightest bulb in the box), and my grandma picked the dress when my sister walked away from it because it was too expensive for her to buy for herself. I know this is my grandma, it‚Äôs not that deep, but it does upset me she chose a color I specifically asked her to not wear as my wedding party is wearing that color. Since she has a habit of going against the rules and wearing whatever she wants, this doesn‚Äôt surprise me. We have recently thought she has been having some memory problems, but I‚Äôm not sure. I haven‚Äôt confronted her yet but I plan to. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being an asshole by confronting her. TIA!

1jx3t03,AITA for going out to eat when my husband is working late shifts?,"My husband and I work different shifts. I worked first shift and he works a late second shift. So we don‚Äôt often eat dinner together because he leaves for work right before I get home and he gets home from work after I am asleep. 

We also have very different tastes in foods. He has a more basic, American food based diet and he also loves seafood. I love foods from other cultures, but I don‚Äôt like seafood. Because of this, when we are home together we cook different meals and eat it together. If I make something he likes, I‚Äôll ask if he wants some. If he makes something I like, he does the same. But we always eat together on our days off, whether it be eating out on a date or eating cooked food at home. We‚Äôve been doing this for years and it‚Äôs worked. 

But since we work different shifts, 5 to 6 days per week, I am eating dinner alone. I usually cook, but a couple times per month, I go out to a restaurant that serves food he doesn‚Äôt like to have dinner. When we are talking later, I usually tell him how I had something from a restaurant and he asks how it was and I tell him. No biggie. 

The other day I was out trying a Peruvian restaurant recommended by a coworker. My husband and I had looked at the menu and he didn‚Äôt see anything he was particularly looking forward to on it, so I added it to my list of places to go when he works. And I went that day. He got out of work early and called me and I told him where I was. And he got mad. 

I finished up and went home and he was upset and asked how long this has been going on for. I was confused because he knows I do this. But apparently he thought I did pickup or delivery. I tend to eat in because I don‚Äôt want dishes at home. He also can‚Äôt really explain why he is so mad, but it seems he‚Äôs mad I‚Äôm out dining alone? I just go out, get food, and read while I wait and eat. Then I come home. It‚Äôs always food he won‚Äôt like as well, so I go alone so I can have it. 

He hasn‚Äôt been really talking to me since it happened. The conversations are short and cold and it makes me feel like I did something wrong by doing this for years and not specifying I eat in the restaurant to do it. He has never acted this way about anything else, he has always been very kind and willing to work through any issues we have. So I am not sure what‚Äôs different with this.

anyways i made like 24 cupcakes and put them out on a tray on the counter. i specifically told everyone that they were for after dinner because my mom wanted to do a candle thing with them instead of a regular cake.

so my brother (he‚Äôs 22) shows up with his girlfriend, who nobody really knows that well cause they been dating for like 2 months? she‚Äôs nice i guess but a little pushy. like she acts like she‚Äôs already part of the family or whatever. idk.

i said ""yeah but they're for later"" and she literally rolled her eyes at me and put it back... after taking a BITE. so now that one‚Äôs ruined obviously.

My wife and I planned a two week vacation just the two of us. I saved up and handled all the planning, while she was in charge of booking the flights.

1jt7ogm,AITA for not buying my stepdaughter a new car after she's repeatedly gotten into accidents?,"My step daughter is not a good driver. She was not a good driver when she was a teen and certainly not as an adult. When she was first learning to drive, she did very fast hard breaks, she repeatedly left her car's lights on or left her car unlocked.

When she first got her permit at 16, we gave her two rules. We would help buy her first car but she'd be on her own for car insurance, gas, and up keep. If she wanted a car, she needed to be the sole caretaker of it and it was on her to ensure she was taking good care of it. Her brothers had the same rules.

3 months into her being 17, she got in her first accident. It was her first time driving in the ice and she slid. Her car hit another car. It was not a serious accident, but it caused roughly 1k in damages. Her car drove for another 2 months, but the transmission went out eventually. She bought it at 160-ishk miles so none of us were surprised it didn't last very long.

When she was 19, she was in another car accident. While on the highway, a semi-truck tried to merge wile riding next to her, she sped up and during it, another car tried to merge right as she sped up. The car was totaled. Outside of wiplash and minor wrist injuries, she was okay. Because of this accident, we made her get her own insurance because our payment went up.

Three weeks ago, she was involved in another accident. Again on the highway, she was passing an on ramp and a car coming on hydroplanned and lost control of a ladder in the back of it's pick up truck. It again totaled her car: it could not leave the scene and we had to get her to bring her back to her college. The other driver broke his collarbone and she has wiplash, a shoulder injury, and some facial damage that should heal in the next bit. The police officer told her that it was not her fault, but obviously we have to wait for the insurance to make that call.

Once she got home from the ER, she asked for us to help her purchase a new car. She said that it's not practical for her to constantly walk everywhere until she could afford a new car. She makes $21 an hour as a CMA at a nursing home so it won't take her long to buy a cheap car. From her apartment, she is about 1.5 miles from college, .25 miles from a grocery store, and 4 miles from her job. I think for the time being, she can walk, ask for rides from friends, or use an app. We don't have public transportation, but lots of side walks. She can walk the entirety from her apartment to class, most to a store, and on and off from her job.

My husband wants us to purchase a new car and have her pay us back. I don't think this is the right move. To date, the only time we have ever helped buy a car is when they all started driving, and we only paid half. She only saved 2k for her first car, so we only gave 4k for a new car. One of her brothers saved up 10k, so we gave 10k. If we start doing this now, we will walk down a very expensive walk.

I have gotten mixed reactions from others.

1k1q1zp,AITA for setting boundaries with my sister during her pregnancy?,"
Hi all,
I (19s, F) have a older sister who is pregnant with her second child. She has a 1.5-year-old son. During her first pregnancy, I supported her a lot because her husband was working full-time. I was happy to do it at the time.

This time, her husband is studying from home and is present all day. Still, she frequently asks me for help‚Äîrunning errands, watching her toddler after I finish work, etc. I‚Äôve suggested they consider part-time daycare to give her a break, but she insists her son is too young and that I should help.

Recently, she told me she expects me to care for her toddler for the entire first month after the baby is born, so she and her husband can focus on the newborn. I told her I‚Äôm exhausted after work and that since her husband is home, he should be more involved.

What‚Äôs been hard is that when I do help, she often tells our mom that I‚Äôm not doing enough. Then I get scolded by our mom, which makes me feel unappreciated and guilty.

I care about my sister, but I feel like she‚Äôs assuming I‚Äôll always be available, without considering my own limits. I‚Äôm starting to feel emotionally drained and like my efforts aren‚Äôt respected.

So, AITA for saying no and establishing limits even though she‚Äôs pregnant?",Internal_Path8845,2326,346,0.9700000286102295,0.1352447410837901,1744930250,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k1q1zp/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_sister_during/,2025,4
1jyl4nr,AITA for insisting that our baby takes my (25F) surname instead of my fiance's (26M)?,"Me (25F) and my fiance Arjun (26M) are currently 5 months along in our pregnancy with our unexpected, but very welcome, first child, a daughter. Relevant to the story, I am white british and he is of Indian descent (3rd gen in UK). This is a throwaway as I don‚Äôt want this to be linked to my actual account.

We met 6 years ago at University on a group project, where we were sorted alphabetically by surname and the rest is history. Obviously, I‚Äôm not going to put our actual surnames on the internet, but they are both 3 or more syllables and begin and end with the same letter/sound. For the sake of the post, say his is Mukherjee and mine is Mulvaney.

We have decided our daughter‚Äôs first and middle names and are looking at the surname situation, which has been heated. I have always been resolute in keeping my surname, and while I always thought I would double barrel any kid‚Äôs names, given the similarity and length of our surnames, we both agree it would be really unfair for the kid as it would be a tongue twister that she would have to explain through school. So, I suggested we use my surname as the surname and have his as a second middle name - basically on all important documentation so if he is taking her anywhere it‚Äôs easier/ won‚Äôt be called up on it. Whilst he said the second middle name was a good idea, he was angry and upset that I want to use my surname, when passing the name down is something fathers do.

Thing is, in my opinion, surnames are very linked to families and his family have made it clear that I am not welcome. His parents, despite both being born in the UK, disagree with our relationship and want him to marry another person from his culture. I have only met them about five times, due to how deeply unpleasant they are to me and he has a distant relationship to them too. My parents and brother (24m) have been the ones to take us under their wings, be there for him and even offer up our home for a bit when he moved to our city. He is super close to them, and my brother is one of his groomsmen in our wedding next year and I want to honour them by giving our surname to our child. I want our daughter‚Äôs surname to represent a place where she, and both of her parents, are always welcome.

He says I have a brother, who can carry on the family name whilst he has a sister who has already had kids, and I retorted saying I don‚Äôt see why that duty should only be for men? I said it‚Äôs not the middle ages anymore, and I am contributing as much money and time into our daughter, am growing and birthing her, and have a family who have supported our relationship and her unconditionally. It became a fight so I went to my parents‚Äô (the next town over) where I am typing this now so we could have a breather. They don‚Äôt know the situation. I get that men have come to expect to have the surname, so I feel really guilty, but I want to carry mine on too.¬†

Any advice is super appreciated, as I really don‚Äôt know what to do.

  
EDIT: Thank you so much for your replies, I got a message saying I should clarify the following. The first name is Western. He's had the girl name picked since he was a teenager, and all of his boy names we discussed pre-finding out were Western - albeit pretty international names. The first name was 100% his choice, and I fell in love with it too as I realised it was a variation of my nan's name. Say my nan was called Carol, the name is Caroline.

1jpa51m,AITA for forbidding my girlfriend from doing household chores?,"A few years ago while putting together furniture, my (26m) girlfriend (27f) injured her wrists from using the screwdriver. We ended up getting her some wrist braces until the pain went away. We eventually checked with a doctor who said it was no big deal.

Since then, I've slowly forbidden her from doing chores around the house. I noticed that doing these chores (sweeping, scrubbing, cleaning dishes, etc.) would consistently agitated her wrists and she wouldn't be able to work on her actual job (small handmade crafts that require a lot of wrist usage.) I kept seeing the pattern of her straining her wrist on chores > bail out on her job after an hour or two and have to wear her wrist brace until the next day. She does love her job and when things go well can happily work up to 6 hours a day on her crafts, so since I can't do her job for her I want her to be able to focus on it.

I have no problem doing these chores, but today I caught her scrubbing a pan when I'd just reminded her yesterday to leave them alone and told her to call me if I'd missed one (and I would have hustled over to do it.)

She told me I'm being overbearing and that she's fine to scrub a pan, but I don't want her getting injured or develop worse long term damage.

AITA for insisting on doing the household chores?

Edit: Some clarifications.

- I should have put ""forbidding"" in quotes. I can't really stop her from doing anything besides maybe chiding her afterwards. I'm not her dad lol.

- I have shown her this thread and she agrees my version of events is more or less accurate but she still feels she's right.

Edit 2: Hello everyone. I stopped responding yesterday because I basically had the answer I needed 10 comments in (I was being the asshole lol) and then this post ended up getting almost 300. I actually got chided myself for spending so much time responding to messages that I ended up slacking on my work.

- I've gotten her a little jig to open soda cans with. I didn't know these things existed until yesterday.

- A lot of people are trying to diagnose her in the comments. We'll keep your ideas in mind the next time we go to the doctor/specialist (and I'll accompany her (if she wants) since people have let me know doctors don't always take women seriously.)

- I appreciate the level headed comments that aimed to help me understand her perspective more (which is why I posted.) To the people voting ESH she says: ""Why am I catching strays here? I just want to do the dishes!""

- Some of you are very angry lol

1jq2nid,"AITA for insisting that my sole provider payment of a $350,000 mortgage counts as a business expense for my wife‚Äôs home business?","AITA for stating that paying the mortgage counts as my contribution to organization of my wife‚Äôs business?

Hello all. I‚Äôm married to a wife I love dearly, but wow we don‚Äôt get along on most things. One of them is the situation with our basement.

I‚Äôm the sole provider‚Äîor at least the primary provider. (I provide at least 90% of our money.) She is a very good stay at home mother. She is also an aspiring business owner, and is finally starting to get it off the ground. She resells little trinkets and assorted goodies on Poshmark.

The issue is that the inventory takes up a LOT of space. It takes up so much space, that when we were in our starter home, it was a constant fight over her buying more inventory but not having anywhere to go with it.

I recently got a massive promotion, and a huge upgraded house. It has over 2,000 square feet, BEFORE counting the expansive open basement. It‚Äôs $350,000, and the monthly payment is $2,500. One reason we got it was so she could essentially have a warehouse where she lives. As the primary breadwinner, I pay for this entirely alone. We‚Äôre both on the property deed, but only I‚Äôm on the mortgage. I also pay for all other life necessities, to include the insurance, gas, and maintenance for three cars, and private tuition for our kids. Due to our quality of life, despite me pulling over $130,000 annual, we are still living paycheck to paycheck. I insist that a house this large is a large luxury‚ÄîI grew up happy in a much smaller house, though she grew up in a house about this size.

Her business is starting to take off, and she finally has the money to pay one employee regularly. She‚Äôs paying this employee-friend to regularly help her organize the massive quantities of inventory that have been unorganized. She takes up over half the basement for her inventory alone, and another quarter for hundreds of gallons of stuff that none of us ever use but she refuses to get rid of. All of my things fit into one quarter of the basement, which I have immaculately organized, mostly because I just don‚Äôt have much.

Point is, basement needs organization, and not my one quarter‚Äîit‚Äôs her three quarters. Full of her stuff. I think I pay enough by paying the mortgage, and that she should have to pay for help if she needs help with those mountains of business inventory and just ‚Äúthings‚Äù she refuses to either use or dispose of. She says I‚Äôm unfair, and contributing nothing since I pay nothing to the helper.

She believes I‚Äôm not contributing to the organization because I have yet to pay a dollar to her employee-friend. She also insists that me paying the mortgage alone doesn‚Äôt count as helping with the business, because she refuses to see a house this large as a luxury and instead thinks I‚Äôm holding the necessity of family housing over her head.

1jvfln7,AITA for getting frustrated that my girlfriend always falls asleep on the couch?,"We‚Äôve been dating for over 2.5 years. She always falls asleep when we watch TV or relax on the couch. Initially, this was adorable as someone was willing to trust me enough to consistently fall asleep on me. I was patient and gently woke her up and put her to bed. After a year, I became impatient because I knew her well enough to be able to tell she was getting comfortable and about to sleep. So, I pause what we‚Äôre watching and ask if she wants to go to bed. She always says she wants to stay on my lap. At first, I found this heartwarming and finished the remaining chores in the house, even though I didn‚Äôt appreciate she didn‚Äôt want to do it before falling asleep. And when i woke her back up to move to the bedroom she always wakes up confused and agitated. This makes me uncomfortable, and I‚Äôve never liked waking anyone up. I also started feeling a bit parental which is not the kind of relationship i want to have. 

Last night she was falling asleep on the couch again and i needed to go shower. I asked her if she wants to stay up or go to bed because I am going to shower. She said she will stay up until i am back. When i returned from the shower i found her sleeping and all of her homework left out on the table (she needs to pack up so she can leave to work tomorrow). We had a major fight because i woke her up but in an openly annoyed and agitated way and told her to start ‚Äúacting like an adult and sleep on the bed‚Äù. We havent spoken since and she is very mad at me. I am not sure how to handle this situation and wondering if i have to comfort her to bed for the rest of my life.

1jyk274,AITA for not caring if my sister visits and not wanting to change my plans?,"I, 24f have two siblings. Aaron, 26m, and Dorothy, 28f. Aaron is my best friend. We have an apartment together in a city a little drive from our parents. 
Dorothy is mentally disabled, she's like a 6 year old in a woman's body. Our parents are going to visit us in the city later this month, and Aaron and I want to take them to our favorite restaurant in our city. It's a delicious Mexican place, I can't even name a favorite dish because everything is so good. My mom asked us to change the restaurant because Dorothy won't eat Mexican food. I declined.
My mom came over with Dorothy the next day because apparently that really upset her. I don't feel like we should have to change our plans and eat at McDonald's. My mom said it's a bigger problem that we've never really tried to include Dorothy. I'll be honest, I don't like Dorothy. It's nothing personal and our parents actually did keep things pretty equal growing up, I'm just 24 and not super interested in censoring my speech and talking about Disney princesses. I don't like real kids either for the same reason. I told my mom maybe just her and Dad can come, so everyone can eat. I'd honestly prefer it that way just for once. My mom said ‚ÄúI think we're done here‚Äù and she walked out.

My dad called and he says I need to apologize to both my mom and to Dorothy, he said mom said Dorothy cried the whole way home because i said i don't like her. That's not what I said and I don't even know if that's true because my mom exaggerates. I've never said that to her face.

1k74si0,AITA to my gf for liking a classmate and friend‚Äôs Instagram post of her pole dancing?,"A friend of mine from grad school is a pole dancer by sport; she takes it seriously and has won pole dancing competitions. She‚Äôs not a stripper and by no means posts anything that can be construed as a thirst trap. Her Instagram is mostly her pole dancing because she‚Äôs an instructor and teaches. Her outfits consist mainly of athletic wear; think about gym/running shorts and tops you‚Äôd see girls in at the gym. 

Every year, the school has a talent show which I attended, and I didn‚Äôt even attend to see her nor did I know she‚Äôd be performing. I follow this friend on Instagram and she posted her performance. I liked it to show my support as a friend and classmate. This is the only post of hers I liked. 

My gf says she found this girl‚Äôs profile through the ‚ÄúSuggested‚Äù list on IG and saw that I liked the post, which made her blow up on me. Gf called me a ‚Äúcreep for liking a thirst trap,‚Äù that it‚Äôs disrespectful to my her as my gf for liking it, and that if her friends saw then it would be embarrassing for her. She also said this when she blew up on me:

It kinda disgusts me you're looking at any other woman, I don't do that. I would never disrespect you like that. I would also not seek out attention like that from anyone- or give it. I deserve the same. especially some lame ass pole dancer. That's just disrespectful.

AITAH? I genuinely just wanted to like the post as a way of supporting a friend and classmate. I‚Äôm not attracted to her at all nor do I see her in that way.

1k3yc8d,AITA for not cleaning before guests came over because I was tired?,"I usually do a majority of chores in the house. My husband helps with laundry and sometimes vacuums, but that‚Äôs pretty much it. I usually don‚Äôt mind because things get done at my pace, if something bothers him, he cleans it, and he is generally appreciative of what I do. And if I ask for help, he will help. 

Lately he has been having friends over after work. He works second shift, so I am asleep by the time this happens. In the past, if he mentioned having people over, I would clean. 
But a couple days ago he mentioned people would be coming over and it was a couple hours before I was going to sleep. 

The last few weeks have been very stressful for me and I haven‚Äôt been cleaning as much as I usually do. I just didn‚Äôt have it in me to clean much before they came over. I was tired. I just cleaned up the dishes from dinner and took out the trash but didn‚Äôt have energy to do more. Then I went to sleep. 

I woke up and he was not in bed. I had some text messages from him saying how it was embarrassing having people over the house because it wasn‚Äôt cleaned. He says it was disrespectful to him and his friends because I knew they were coming but didn‚Äôt fully clean up. 

I talked to him about it later that day and he said the same points again. He said I had a couple hours before bed and I should‚Äôve at least vacuumed, mopped, and picked things up. I told him I was too tired to do that and if he wants to have me do all the cleaning, then he needs to accept it will be done at my pace and depending on what time, energy, and motivation I have. I don‚Äôt mind doing it, but it‚Äôs on my schedule. That‚Äôs the price of the arrangement. 

He thinks I was being spiteful by not cleaning more and that I am being rude by my comment on our arrangement. But I just didn‚Äôt have the energy for more cleaning.

1k0uoqa,AITA for cancelling on my friend after she wouldn‚Äôt pay for our lunch?," I 16F and my friend 17F (let‚Äôs call her D) have been friends for about 3 years. We are very close and hang out outside of school very frequently. We agreed to meet each other for a couple hours to study for our ap test. For context: every month my parents give me 100-200 dollars on a credit card so I can budget out what i‚Äôm going to spend for the month and D has been asking me almost every. single. day if I can get her coffee before school as I go very frequently. I‚Äôm going to be honest it does bother me that she asks all the time considering she has a bigger amount of money than me and she could easily just go get one herself before school and she never offers to pay me back. So knowing this, I asked her if she could pay for the food at our hang out since I got her about 5 coffees this month without being payed back. She agreed at first and then said she couldn‚Äôt anymore because she needs to buy a different friend a birthday present. I told her that my monthly allowance had run out and that I couldn‚Äôt go anymore. She seemed annoyed but I didn‚Äôt want to ask if she was upset or bring up that I was upset. I feel like it‚Äôs very selfish that she asks me for coffee almost every day but then won‚Äôt pay for our most likely 20 dollar meal. She also asks other people for coffee when I say no and I feel really used just because I drive to school and she has a license and a car but her dad drives her. 


UPDATE: she reluctantly agreed to pay after I told her I couldn‚Äôt go if she wasn‚Äôt paying and to answer some questions: the coffees are about 7 dollars each and I do get myself one too when I get her one and to be clear she has had my back in the past and payed for  big expensive meals once or twice when I really had no money she hasn‚Äôt been asking for the coffees for very long only about a month or so .

1jyl1xn,AITA for siding with my dad in the divorce even though he cheated on my mom?,"
My dad(52m) and my mom(49f) separated nearly 8 months ago due to my dad having an affair. I(17f) understand that my dad is in the wrong and cheating is never ok but recently I‚Äôve found myself resenting my mom due to her reaction to the divorce.

She has been putting voice recorders in all of our vehicles, including mine. There is no way to know where else these are hidden it makes me feel uncomfortable to talk out loud even in my own home. She also put cameras all around our house hoping to catch my dad since he is no longer allowed in our home. She even put one directly in front of my bedroom which has not been removed even though I told her it seemed weird to me especially since I‚Äôve given her no reason not to trust me and didn‚Äôt see a purpose behind putting a camera there. 

My dad had to buy a new phone since she could still log into his Apple ID and would go through it as well as log into his facebook and other social medias. Her email was the recovery email for all his passwords seeing as my dad has never been good with technology. Even after buying a new phone she somehow still has access to his location, I‚Äôm not sure how but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to find out she had an AirTag or tracker of sorts somewhere. She checks his location religiously and will leave at all hours of the day to follow him if she thinks he is going to meet another woman.

The reason I‚Äôm asking if I‚Äôm the asshole is because me and my mom recently got into an argument. I‚Äôve had a strained relationship with her since she found out I was gay about a year ago but we are civil and just don‚Äôt talk about it. This argument started because she was questioning me about my relationship with my girlfriend(18f) and trying to tell me that she wasn‚Äôt good for me. I was annoyed with her because I try not to talk about my girlfriend around her to avoid the conflict. When she brought it up I responded without thinking and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should be giving out relationship advice.‚Äù She immediately started crying and saying it wasn‚Äôt her fault and I shouldn‚Äôt hold that over her. I left the room but later we were watching TV and she reignited the issue by venting to me about dad and kept mentioning how he would probably marry ‚Äúsome whore‚Äù and just fully shit talking my dad to me and saying how horrible he was to her. I know she‚Äôs upset but I wish she wouldn‚Äôt vent to me about this situation because I still love my dad and would rather not be involved. I tried to just switch the topic but she doubled down so I said ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt really matter who he marries.‚Äù This upset her and she accused me of not caring at all that they split and then told me I was just like him and didn‚Äôt have any emotions. At this point I was angry with her and I said I would rather be like my dad than her and I could understand why dad would want to be with someone else.

Now she is accusing me of siding with my dad and excusing his actions. ",Educational_Slice658,533,515,0.7699999809265137,0.09892295852734762,1744586900,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jyl1xn/aita_for_siding_with_my_dad_in_the_divorce_even/,2025,4

I made reservations at a restaurant for the evening of my birthday and planned for me, my mum, my stepdad, my best friend and my younger sister (18) to go. Two days before my birthday, me and my sister had an argument because I wasn't able to pick her up because my friend had a medical emergency and I was the only one with him at the time so stayed with him. I was able to leave when the ambulance arrived due to his sister getting there. I was panicking at the time and forgot to text her that I wasn't able to pick her up. I completely forgot I was supposed to pick her up and then went home. I apologised profusely and she was still furious. We were both shouting because the argument got heated. She then said ""You're acting just like our dad"". Our dad was neglectful and emotionally abusive to us growing up, we often argued with him and he frequently forgot to pick us up from school.

1k7yr8k,AITA for holding SO responsible for kid eating food meant to be shared,"SO has 2 teen boys. They're going through puberty and rapidly growing, I get it. My problem is one of them consistently - about once a week - eats ALL of something that was bought for everyone to share. Sometimes it's all in one sitting, sometimes he takes it to his room and munches over 1-2 days until it's gone before anyone notices. In the past I've never complained because he's a teen (try to be understanding) and not my kid....

But a few days ago I get groceries including Costco size bags of tortilla chips and chocolate chips. Next day I'm looking to eat some chips and salsa, chips gone. I know what happened. Annoyed but don't. A few hours later I go down to bake with the chocolate chips and they're gone too, an entire 48 oz bag disappeared, emptied.

SO is out to dinner so I wait until it's supposed to be over then text him simply saying all the chips and chocolate chips I bought yesterday got eaten, buy more on the way home. Which he does. But then gets home fuming for making him do it. I tell him I think his anger is misplaced because I shouldn't have even had to ask, that stuff shouldn't be gone already. He's like what do you expect me to do about it? I tell him I just expect him to be responsible for his kid's actions. Then he said he will tell the teens not to touch anything I buy ever again. I replied you know that's not what I'm saying, you can allow whatever behavior you want but if it's inconsiderateness you should be still responsible for making right when it affects other people. He still thinks I'm being ridiculous, that it's no big deal.

They were already older when we got married, their mom is actively involved, and SO and I agreed that I should stay out of parenting and punishment.

I'll also add that if I see this kind of stuff happening I do say something politely just being the adult, like hey how about take a bowl of chips to your room instead of the whole bag, you can always get more but somebody else might want some... or like hey before you eat that last slice of pizza maybe you should see if your brother wants it since we got it for yall to share. I just don't lecture or reprimand after the fact, because it seems to cross into more punishment territory... besides that, SO allows it and it seems to mostly just happen behind my back at this point.

Also I could not go to the store myself because we have a baby who was already asleep for the night.
