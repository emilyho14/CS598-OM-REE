190cay4,AITA for telling my sons that we would have only one child if my daughter were the first born?,[removed],bluegarden63,5541,5565,0.8199999928474426,0.739538301919419,1704580635,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190cay4/aita_for_telling_my_sons_that_we_would_have_only/,2024,1
1af0v6p,AITA for coming to dinner basically topless?,"I've dreaded posting for a while because I'm afraid I might be the AH. But i just gotta know. So here goes. 
My parents in law and brother in law came to visit and stay for a month with my husband (27M) and i (28F) after i had my baby.
For context if it makes any difference, I'm German, husband and his family are Italian. 
The baby was 3 months old at the time and i breastfeed her. Usually I'd just nurse on the couch in the living room but because company was staying, I'd go to my bedroom. 
After i nursed her, she'd fall asleep and take a nap and I'd have some free time. Since family was visiting, i tried to plan her naps around our mealtime to spend time with family uninterrupted.
My mother in law has this thing that when food is on the table, you be there pronto.
Sometimes I'd be late coming to a meal because babies can be unpredictable and she wouldn't fall asleep right away or nursed longer than normal. To this my mother in law would barge into my room and annouce food was ready, all impatient. This startled the baby and made the process last much longer than it should have. The result is I had to eat much later than everyone else, alone, and the food was cold. It left me fuming. More work to do with the baby and I'm secluded. 
This happened several times. I asked my husband to talk to her and explain i can't always come on time.
He talked to her but she still did all this anyway. So i simply decided to stop being late to the dinners. 
The next time she barged in my room and announced food was ready, i came without hesitation. I came to the table exactly as i was. No shirt, half a bra, baby hanging on one tit. (nothing was seen as the baby's head covered up everything anyway but still) 
Ensue uproar. Goes something like:
MIL exclaims what the hell I'm doing at the table like this. I'm indecent, there are men at the table. I should be ashamed. I yell back what the hell does she keep calling me to the table for if I'm not yet ready. I have no reason to be in my room alone with my baby while everyone else is out having a great time together. 
Brother and FIL are trying not to get in on the argument. Husband ushers me back to my room and scolds me, taking his mother's side. He means he gets I'm frustrated but this action didn't help anything. But... 
After that MIL didn't bother again while i was busy with the baby. So what if i came to some meals a little after everyone had started eating. The roof didn't cave in!
Anyways everyone lived happily ever after. The end.

19euvrm,AITA for refusing to share my vacation home with my in-laws for six months after they sold their house without consulting me?,"
AITA for refusing to share my vacation home with my in-laws for six months after they sold their house without consulting me?
Background: My husband (35M) and I (33F) have been married for five years. We own a beautiful vacation home on the beach that we built ourselves and use throughout the year. My in-laws (60s) have always been welcome guests, visiting for a few weeks here and there, and contributing financially towards maintenance costs.

 Last month, my in-laws suddenly announced they were selling their house to ""downsize"" and move into a tiny condo. Apparently, they've been secretly harbouring this idea for months, never mentioning it to me or my husband. They plan to close on the sale in two weeks and then... move into our vacation home for six months while they ""figure things out.""

I was floored. This house is our sanctuary, not a retirement home extension. We use it frequently, have friends and family booked to visit throughout the year, and rely on the income it generates during peak season. My in-laws, on the other hand, haven't lifted a finger on the property themselves and contributed only minimally.

 My husband, bless his sweet heart, is more understanding. He feels bad for his parents and believes we can ""make it work."" His in-laws, sensing my resistance, are now guilt-tripping us, claiming they have nowhere else to go and offering to pay ""significantly more"" than their usual contribution.

AITA for refusing to let them move in? On one hand, I feel obligated to help family in need, but on the other, this feels like an outrageous imposition on our personal space and finances.",Mountain_Cash5850,7260,3141,0.9700000286102295,0.5960611850050315,1706139297,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19euvrm/aita_for_refusing_to_share_my_vacation_home_with/,2024,1
1ae8maz,AITA for choosing my wife instead of my niece?,"I (m25) have a niece (f6), I'm her godfather, she's the only kid in the family for now so she's quite spoiled

Her birthday party was last Saturday, my sister said that my niece wanted a Disney themed birthday (Encanto), so my sister asked me to dress up as one of the characters. This is something that we usually do for my niece, since she likes it and it's fun. I said yes like three weeks ago, so please have that in mind. 

My wife (f25) is pregnant, she's nine weeks along, but she's already having a lot of symptoms and she doesn't feel great. She has a lot of nausea, some smells get her very sick and she's just feeling tired/ moody since she's not getting a lot of sleep either. 

The day before the party she had been sick most of the night, so we didn't sleep well. The party was at 2pm, my wife actually told me to go to the party *** because she could stay alone, she was tired and feeling quite needy but she was mostly ""fine"" (no nausea at the moment, she was able to eat something and was a bit more comfortable) but I felt terribly leaving her alone. So I decided to stay with her so we could cuddle and rest.

I texted my sister to let her know that I'm not coming to the party at around 1:45 or so. Now, I know my sister, I know that she and our family would've called me and send me texts to try to get me to go, so my wife and I turned our phones off so we could have a peaceful nap. 

Just as I thought, hours later when I turned on my phone again I had tons of calls and missed texts. I read the texts and it seems like at some point my niece made a big tantrum because I wasn't there (because I promised her to go as one of the characters of the movie and play with her/ the kids. She refused to do anything and listen to her parents, so long story short they had to end the party early. My whole family is absolutely blaming me for ruining the party. My sister said I'm an asshole because I promised her daughter to be there dressed up and then didn't show up, I remind her that I said yes three weeks ago, so a lot of stuff can change in those three weeks. I told them what my wife was going through and why I wanted to stay with her.

They called me off and said that she (my wife) is somehow trying to get me away from them, they said that she's an adult and doesn't need to be pampered all the time, she could be a couple hours alone. I told them off for acting and talking like that about her, and said that I can do whatever I want with my time and I told my sister that if she would've raised her daughter better than she wouldn't have made that scene. We had a big argument which ended in insults. 

Now almost everyone is on their side and not mine, am I really wrong here? I feel like they're not trying to understand the reason why I didn't go to the party, like I'd rather have my wife feel great and go to the birthday party than this. They say that I'm acting selfish but to me they're the selfish ones. Please give your opinions and I'll answer any questions if there's any

*** My wife told me to go to the party if I wanted, but she preferred me to stay since she wanted cuddles. She wasn't feeling very sick physically at the moment, but she mostly wanted emotional support

Please bare with me if I don't explain myself too well, we're Spanish 

I can't answer all the comments I'm sorry!! 

My family knows that my wife is pregnant for those who were wondering. My niece is six years old, not sixteen!! I told them I wasn't going fifteen minutes before because I was debating weather to go or not. My wife said to go but she wanted me to stay since she needed emotional support, she's needy and emotional for now... 
I know that turning off the phone is rude, sorry, I'm just used to doing it since my family is too much sometimes and they can't take a no when I do something they don't like, so I wanted to prevent that or at least postpone it

Also this was my niece's birthday party but her actual birthday was another day, that's why I didn't mention telling her happy birthday or something like that, I greeted her on her birthday day (last Wednesday)",Affectionate-Rip5017,5206,3210,0.8999999761581421,0.5134659027086081,1706568310,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ae8maz/aita_for_choosing_my_wife_instead_of_my_niece/,2024,1
196uaoo,AITA for refusing to pay rent in my bf mom’s house for staying there?,"So I (F19) and my boyfriend (M20) live separately. I have a place of my own that I rent, but my boyfriend lives with his mom still because she’s pretty sick and has no one else to care for her. 

I stay over there pretty often (maybe 2-3 nights a week) because my boyfriend works night shifts and his mom still needs someone to look after her, so I’m more than happy to stay over and do whatever needs doing. 

However, now she is asking me to pay $350 a month for staying round so often. 

This honestly baffles me, because I literally only stay there overnight a few nights a week, I barely use her food, I have the odd shower but that’s IT. I certainly dont use $350 worth of her stuff a month. This is on top of the $350 that my boyfriend pays her, which is fair enough because he lives there full time. 

Why should I pay rent on her house when I already have a place of my own that’s quite expensive?

I told her no, that’s not fair, but now she’s angry at me. My boyfriend is on my side but i can’t help but feel like I could be an AH.

EDIT: thank you guys so much for the support and advice, i really appreciate it. 
I just wanna clear a few things up for everyone. I’ve seen a few comments stating that I “don’t do anything” for my boyfriend’s mom. 
It was my mistake for not stating it in this post, so i’m sorry about that. I did address this in the comments but I understand that not everyone will see that. 

My boyfriend’s mom is bed bound and needs assistance into her wheelchair to get around. She can’t wheel the chair herself as she has arthritis (amongst other things) , so wheeling her chair would be much too heavy and strenuous for her. 

She needs assistance onto the toilet, into the bath, reaching into kitchen cupboards etc. Everything in her house has been adapted to be as accessible as it possibly can be, but she still needs a lot of assistance for her daily activities. 

I do a lot of these tasks for her during the night, as she sleeps a lot in the day so at night she’s pretty awake and is wanting food/water/bathroom visits. It was very clumsy of me to state in the comments that i “literally just go there to sleep and make sure she’s okay”, as that’s not the case, I just djdnt think before typing. I hope that clears things up! Again thank you for all the advice <3",Prettyintrusion,5784,2437,0.949999988079071,0.46900100194531824,1705276541,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/196uaoo/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_rent_in_my_bf_moms_house/,2024,1
1af1tlx,WIBTA if I press charges on my MIL for selling my collection of vintage skeleton keys to buy a new phone?,"This is somewhat urgent. My MIL is insanely entitled. And my wife's enabling of her has made our marriage very hard at times. MIL has come to us for money many times because she keeps spending herself into a hole because she's a hoarder. Recently she came to us wanting me specifically to buy her a new smartphone. And she threw a massive fit when I refused.

I had quite a collection of vintage skeleton keys. And I mean good ones. Like ones to particular hotels, the large ornate Sargents, brass railroad keys, etc. My collection as a whole should have easily been worth two to three thousand dollars. I kept them in a locked display cabinet. But yesterday I came home to find my entire collection gone. The cabinet had been forced open. I checked the CCTV for the living room, and saw my MIL force open the cabinet with a small crowbar. I called MIL and demanded she return my entire collection. She nonchalantly told me she sold the entire collection at pawn already, and used the money for her new phone. Then said it was my fault, and she had to do it because I wouldn't give her the money.

My wife was seemingly on my side, until I said I was going to call police. Now she's begging me to just drop it. And even suggested I just start a new collection. A lot of those keys are irreplaceable, and I spent 10 years building that collection. MIL has been trouble in the past. But this is the first time I know of that she's stolen from us. I need help!

194fwpj,"AITA for buying something someone had already ""claimed""?","So I (22F) was at Goodwill the other day looking around. On one of the shelves I noticed a basket turned upside down, picked it up to look at it (I was looking for a container to put my jewelry in) and found this really pretty little marble statue underneath. Like one of those ones of a lady with the arms and head cut off. I really liked it and it was only 5 bucks, so I decided to get it. But this lady near me noticed what I was holding and said ""Uh oh. This other lady was looking at that. I think she hid it under the basket so no one else would see it"". I asked if she was gonna buy it, the lady said she wasn't sure. She looked around and said she didn't see the woman anywhere. I felt a little bad, but I carried it around for a while looking at other stuff, and figured if that lady saw me holding it she could come argue with me if she felt like it. 

After maybe 10-15 more minutes of looking, I was ready to leave and went to the checkout. Right when I set my stuff down I heard this voice say ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" And this older lady came up right next to me and put her hand on the statue. I noticed a man was with her, probably her husband. ""I was gonna buy this, I hid it. It's mine"" she said. I don't like confrontation, but I was also kinda mad that she was already getting in my face. I said ""I've been carrying this around and you haven't come up to talk to me about it until now. I didn't know you were set on buying it""

""Well didn't you notice it was hidden? I was making up my mind and I hid it so no one else would see it. And I decided, I'm gonna buy it"" 

""Someone told me a lady was looking at it, but I didn't know you were gonna buy it. I'm sorry, I'm already getting it"" And we both looked at the poor cashier, who kind of shrugged and said ""yeah I mean she's already up here buying it. And you can't really call dibs on something, you haven't purchased it yet"". Then the lady's husband gets involved and says ""cmon kid, let her have the statue. We're gonna put it on the dining room table. Where are you gonna put it, your desk?"" And I said YEP I am because I'm buying it. 

They both just kind of scoffed and looked at each other like I was some young punk who had just disrespected them or something. I give the cashier my card, I sign for it, he hands me my bag, meanwhile they're still standing there. I don't think either wanted to do something as blatant as physically take it from me. The lady said ""You want it that bad, even though I already was gonna buy it? I've been looking for a decoration like this for months. Are you gonna die if you don't have it? And I said ""yes I am"" and I walked out cause I didn't feel like fighting anymore. Meanwhile they followed me outside (and lucky me we parked near each other) saying stuff like ""no respect!"" and ""unbelievable!"" 

And I swear to God I think the woman even said ""what a little bitch"" before she closed her door",sunny543,6387,1044,0.9800000190734863,0.3699115541276527,1705015606,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/194fwpj/aita_for_buying_something_someone_had_already/,2024,1
194gbbk,AITA for not letting my ex husband to bring his now wife to our daughters birthday party,"(I will be using fake names btw)

My ex husband (David) and I were married for 5 years and last year we divorced. We have a one  daughter (lily) who recently turned 7 this year.

Lily's birthday was around the corner so I was busy with decorations,  the cake and the invitations. I asked her who she wanted to attended her birthday party and she said she wanted her aunts , uncle's,  cousins basically everyone she knew from both sides .

I wasn't bothered with  lily inviting anyone from her fathers side because we were both familiar and comfortable with them . I called David and I told him about the invitations and he was cool with it until he bought up his wife. He told  me that he will bring his wife , he didn't ask me , he told me like he was forcing it because he knew I would say no and I did say no . 

I told that I was not comfortable with his wife especially her meeting lily and lily doesn't even know her that much   and I haven't even had a proper talk with her before she can see my daughter. The only thing I knew about this lady was that she did something wrong with my husband knowing very well he's married and has a daughter and I was supposed to feel comfortable with that. 

He then told me that I was making this about me and not lily , that lily is child , she doesn't even know anything yet and he really wants lily to meet his wife and she also wants to meet her . I said to him that if she really wants to meet lily then she has to speak to me first and see how she really is before I can trust her with my baby. 

He replied to me by saying that I was jealous and that I didn't want lily too see her new family and be comfortable with them and that i was hurting his wife because I wouldn't let her see her step daughter who is like her own daughter. 

I was done with him and told him if he didn't want to come then it's fine it's not like he payed a single dime for anything for the birthday party and he was crazy for me to say yes to a woman who ruined my marriage and is the reason why my daughter has to grow up with separated parents .

EDIT: The step mom does know lily and lily knows that she does have step mom but they haven't met which is not my responsibility and yes David does have visitation rights so I don't know why he doesn't introduce them to each other. That's reason why step mom said she also wants to meet her.

19bocje,AITA for dressing inappropriately in front of my BIL?,"So to start this off, this issue is with me 22f, my sister 26f and her husband 30m. 

To add some backstory, basically ever since they started growing, my breasts have been large, I have a very small frame otherwise and I am 5ft2, so almost my whole life I have thought that my body looked weird. I have always covered up as best as I could with large hoodies, big t-shirts and so on. I have always dressed this way as I genuinely was ashamed and hated my body. I started working at 16 knowing my main goal was to afford a breast reduction, last year I was finally able to afford it and got them done. They are still a bit on the bigger side, but I have never ever felt so comfortable and happy in my own body as I do now (not to mention the weight that has LITERALLY been lifted off my shoulders!?). 

So this last weekend my sister and her husband came to visit our family, and we had planned a dinner at a restaurant. It was nothing extravagant, but still a pretty nice place. I just wore jeans with a tight fitting shirt, it did not show my breast but since it is tight fitting you can see the outline of them. I thought everything went well, we all chatted and talked like usual, but a bit in I noticed BIL was staring at me extremely much. I got kind off uncomfortable and I think my sister also noticed and she was silent for almost the whole night after that. I thought she was mad at BIL and that she could see that I was uncomfortable with his stares.

But the same night she texted me, telling me that I did not need to dress so inappropriate in front of a married man, that I need to have some self respect and that she did not think I was the type to try and seduce a married man. I texted her, explaining that it was not my intention and told her that I actually felt uncomfortable with his stares. She texted me back just saying that if I did not want him to stare, then I should have not dressed that way.

I was extremely upset by all of this and talked with my mother, but my mother agreed with my sister. I am starting to feel like I should’ve thought about covering up and do more, especially since my mother also thinks I was an asshole for this..",throwaway2847362662,4712,1063,0.9599999785423279,0.2992081384868963,1705791263,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19bocje/aita_for_dressing_inappropriately_in_front_of_my/,2024,1
192thmi,AITA for not wanting to spend the entire vacation sun up to sun down with my husband’s family?,"My husband and I were planning a vacation for us and our 2 kids. We’ll be gone for 8 days in the summer. We’ve saved for this trip for years and were super excited.

This place is about 3 hours away from my husband’s family. They invited us to spend some days with them. However, from the start I said I wanted alone time with just the 4 of us. With the kids getting older, we don’t get a lot of time with them. We don’t have the money to travel often. I suggested 3-4 days with his family, then we’d go to the actual vacation spot. I also set the boundary we’d stay in a hotel. They all seemed to agree.

Then out of nowhere, my husband’s family decided to go to our vacation spot for the full 8 days. That’s when the hints began that we all get a house to rent. I said no. I love my husband’s family but it’d just be too much and I wanted time just us. We don’t need to be around each other 24/7. After that, my SIL started making plans for all 8 days that included us. 

I put my foot down to my husband and said no. We could spend 4 days with his family, maybe 5. But I wanted just a few just us. We never get to go on vacation. And his family visits once or twice a year so it’s not like we don’t see them.

My husband says I’ve hurt his family’s feelings. When I spoke to my SIL she said I should understand why it hurts I won’t spend the entire time with them. I asked how they’d feel if they planned a trip and we tried to change the plan. She said family does this stuff for each other.

195zlrv,AITA for cooking dinner for my girlfriend instead of taking her out like I promised?,"My girlfriend (f22) and I (m22) have been dating for little over a year.

We're both in college. Tbh I don't feel like going out most of the time, so I almost always suggest my girlfriend to stay in my apartment and order something/ cook something instead of going out. I often don't want to go to parties or such with her, which annoys her a lot. 

The other day my girlfriend mentioned a new sushi (I think, or Asian food) restaurant in our town and asked if we could go. Originally I agreed, I said that we could go on Friday. However, I didn't feel like going out last night, so instead I cooked dinner for us and when she came to my apartment (so we could go to the restaurant together) I told her that we could leave it for another day and eat at home. She was annoyed and said that I always do the same thing, I told her to chill because we could go another day. It's not like the restaurant will go anywhere, right? 

I cooked carbonara pasta for dinner, but my girlfriend said that she won't have it because she wants fish, not pasta. I told her ""okay, we can order sushi if you want"" and rolled my eyes, which made her go off on me, telling me that she feels like I want to hide her? Like if I'm embarrassed of her or something, when it's not the truth at all.

She knows my family and friends, I make all the time I can to spend time with her and I'm certainly not ashamed of her because why would I be? I'm just not an outgoing person and she knows it. She had said something similar a few months ago because I didn't post enough about her on social media (I post like twice a year). I also got upset over her comment and told her to leave if she didn't like how I am, and she left.

1abvevj,"AITA for letting my Stepdad tank my mother's birthday, ""To Make Myself Look Good""?","So, it was my 20F mom's birthday, and it was her 40th, which my family regards as a milestone birthday. This birthday is a bit more important, because my mother is anxious about her 40's. Her father passed in his, so it was important to me that she begins this decade on a positive note.

My mother has been married to my stepdad for 9 years, together on and off for 16 years. My stepdad is notoriously bad at birthdays. So since I was 17, I've planned my mother's birthday, mother's day, Christmas, etc.. I've tell everyone what we're doing, what she may want, who is allowed to know what, etc. She's been noticeably happier with that arrangement. Which has left a dent in my stepdads ego. So he said he would be planning my mother's birthday, without any of my ""ornery"" supervision. He made it very clear he did not want my input. So I let him do it, sure I gave him a good example to go by.

However, as the day approached, it became clear that his plans weren't turning out as my mom would have wanted. He didn't celebrate because he mixed up the days, and took the wrong day off work, so he planned for the day before. He ordered a marble cake with whipped icing, tickets to The Color Purple, and a reservation to an Italian restaurant. Her favorite cake is chocolate with buttercream, she hates musicals, and her favorite thing to eat is steak w/ lobster tails. He didn't invite me or my siblings, to any of these plans either, as the cherry on top. Worried that my mom might be disappointed, I discreetly made backup birthday plans, thinking it would be a nice surprise.

So when the day before came, I let my stepdad give her the wrong cake, a musical, and a plate of pasta. He also lied and said he had mandatory overtime at his job on her actual birthday. Obviously she did not have a good time

 So the next day, I surprised her with ""everything"". Flowers, breakfast, spa day, comedy show, and a dinner at a steakhouse, with all of her children included. And she cried happy tears into her chocolate w/ buttercream cake. Overall a wonderful success.

When my stepfather found out, he was furious, feeling like I undermined his efforts and made him look bad. He argued that I should have trusted his plans and not taken matters into my own hands, for the sole purpose to make myself look good.

I explained that I only wanted to ensure my mom had a special day, and the backup plans were meant to be a thoughtful gesture. Despite my intentions, tensions escalated as he felt his authority was challenged.

Now, I'm left wondering: AITA for trying to salvage my mom's birthday, or did I overstep by creating backup plans without consulting my stepfather?

EDIT/INFO: First off, thank you for the kind responses. I did go into it wanting to make my mom happy, and I'm happy the consensus is that it was all that mattered. Now to answer a few questions.

1.Why did my mother's husband not know jack ish about my mama? - He does know these facts about her, and I've mentioned all of these things to him before. Apparently, he got all of these ideas from his mother. Because she's the best source of information about my mom. And her words override everything I ever said about her.

2. How do I know she was upset with his plans? - The first sign is the fact I know she doesn't like those things to begin with. 2nd HE was upset with her for being quiet/short with him since dinner, he was fussing at her since they came in the house. 3rd She came home and went straight to bed, without speaking to anyone. The difference between that, and how my events ended, are very apparent. I'm not pulling that out of my behind.

3. Why did I allow him to make the plans at the expense of my mother's day? - I didn't ""allow"" him to do anything. He's a grown adult man, and I'm not a babysitter. I had nothing to gain from his failure, but a sad mom. I probably would've said something if he had bothered to celebrate on the proper date. She still had a great time at the end of the day. 

4. Do I dislike my stepfather? - No. I don't happen to like him though either. My father was present growing up, so he wasn't comfortable taking a parental role, or really any role, in my life growing up. So he's really just the guy my mom is married to.

5. Why is my mom with him? - She was young mother with 3 young children, his apathy towards is made her feel we could be safe in the same household with him. Now though, she's just comfortable with the status quo. She's really no fuss, so this is really only an issue on special milestone, holidays. Like for their 10th anniversary this year, she wants something really nice. But for their 9th last year, they went bowling, and she was happy. He what she needed in the beginning, now she has no reason to get rid of him, because she doesn't feel mistreated.

6. What does my mom think? - She doesn't know this wasn't the original plan. She really thinks I planned that dumpster fire, to make her birthday seem more special, because my stepdad couldn't attend. She hasn't asked me to clarify, so I won't say anything unless she does ask.

Today I came home from school to find my sister in tears( Her school isn’t open right now) when I asked her what’s wrong she said our aunt had said that she wasn’t special and that its irritating hearing her talk about it and that she is being selfish. My aunts baby was supposed to be born the same day as my sister and I know it must be hard for her but I got mad that she would say that to a little girl so I went in there to confront her. I asked my aunt what made her think she could do that and she said she just had a miscarriage and to leave her alone, I told her just because she had a miscarriage doesn’t mean she gets to treat every kid with the same birthday like sh!t, she got mad and yelled that she was hurting, this maybe the part where I’m the AH, I told her that I get she’s hurting but she’s also not special and that her problems don’t mean that she can lash out and be a b!tch to everyone else.My aunt left crying calling me an AH.

1aco6ek,AITA for not wanting to give my step-cousin my new dress?,"My (16f) whole family (grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) is attending a formal event in a couple of weeks.

My step-cousin “Jen” and I are the same age, and her dad married my aunt when she was 6. Jen’s dad doesn’t make a lot of money, so Jen didn’t have a lot of things growing up, and my mother would always give my old things to Jen rather than throw them away. Especially for formal events, which we all attend quite often because of my grandparents, my mother would always take the dress I’d worn to the last function and give it to Jen so that her dad didn’t have to buy one. As we’re now older and not growing, I now only loan the dresses to Jen.

I assumed it would be the same this time, so a few days ago when Jen and her family came over for dinner I took Jen upstairs to give her the dress. Jen saw the new dress I had for the event and asked if I would loan her that one instead. She said she’d never got to wear a dress everyone hadn’t already seen me in and it wasn’t fair she always had hand me downs. I said no, because I’d bought the dress to wear to this event, I was being nice to lend her a dress, she doesn’t get to demand it be the new one. 

Jen and I were arguing and eventually the adults got involved. My parents stick up for me and said I don’t have to share the dress, but Jen was very upset and her dad took her side, saying it wouldn’t kill me to wear one of the many other dresses I have and just let Jen have the special one for once. I then said if she wants a specific dress he should buy it, not try and take it from kids, which set him off. 

The parents are now fighting over this dress drama, and part of me thinks maybe I should have just loaned Jen the dress. I love that dress and I was excited to wear it, which is why I didn’t, and my parents say I absolutely shouldn’t. But I don’t want everyone to fall out over it.

I listed the manga for Cowboy Bebop on eBay and the start price for the auction is $75. I paid that much when I bought them and the median price for all 5 volumes seems to be about $150-200.

My friend messaged me and said she wants the manga for her boyfriend's birthday. I asked her how much she's offering and she said $30. I said no and the price is firm, even for a friend. Then she upped the price to $35... Still too low. I sent her a link to the auction and said she could bid on it like everyone else.

With permission from our boss we decided to fill up her entire office with balloons, normally we start working at 9AM but for this we came in 3 hours early at 6AM.  


Together we spent around 50$ worth of equipment to do this, we finished this within 2 hours and started waiting until Lily came to the office. After 45 minutes she arrived and she went up to her office, once she got to her office she opened the door and the entire room was filled with balloons. But since there were so many, alot of them escaped the room and fell onto Lily.   


She suddenly started screaming and backed off really quickly, we went out of hiding and surprised her.  Then she said she was very allergic for latex, but I didn't understand. She explained that balloons are made of Latex, and that I should've known that she was allergic for Latex.  


After 30 minutes the allergic reaction became so severe that she had to be rushed to the hospital, I didn't mean to do this since I thought balloons were made out of rubber. It's been 2 days and she's recovering at home since returning from the hospital today.

Since I'm an artist my mom asked me to paint something for a project she's working on. At first I was hesitant, and originally not going to do it since I don't make art for free, but she was being very persistent so I agreed to help just to get her to stop asking. Today she went to drop off some library books and asked me to go with her. 

She told my brother (17m) that she was going to stop to get some lunch and asked him what he wanted, he said he wasn't very hungry and not to get him anything. She never asked me what I wanted, but I assumed since I was going with her she would ask me once we got there. We dropped off the books and she started making her way home. 

I asked her if we were still getting lunch and she said ""no, your brother isn't hungry"". I said ""well I'm hungry, I haven't eaten today and there's no food at the house"". And I'm not exaggerating, we are out of food because my parents need to go grocery shopping, my mom said she'd do it tomorrow, so we won't have anything to eat until then. If we had ingredients I would just make something but we don't even have enough stuff to make a homemade meal. She called my brother and once again asked him what he wanted to eat, he said ""I'm not that hungry, just get me something small."" She never asked me what I wanted. 

We pull into the drive thru and she still didn't bother to ask me what I wanted to eat, she orders what my brother asked for and something for her self, then without asking me if I wanted anything or giving me enough time to spit out my order, she said ""that will be everything"". Then drove through the line. I was shocked, and really upset. But what really irks me is she seemed completely oblivious to what she did. She was just like ""you didn't want anything, did you?"" After we got the food.

Of course I wanted something, I told you before we pulled in that I was hungry and didn't eat anything today. She wasn't even going to get food, ahe was going to drive straight home until I said something. Then she had to audacity to tell me that I need to work on her stupid project when we get home. I'm really fed up that she keeps demanding I do this for her, without even offering me compensation, or at the very least getting me something to eat so I'm not working on an empty stomach. When we got home I told her she can do it herself, and that I won't be helping her with it. She called me rude and entitled, and maybe I am, but I feel disrespected, and I won't take that from my own mother.

1af0zdl,AITA for not disclosing cakes are dairy free,"I’m a hobby baker not a professional. I make cakes/cupcakes/treats for family and friends of family. I’m also lactose intolerant.

I’ve been used to cooking and baking dairy free for years now and it’s just become second nature to me. Due to regular baking I often bulk buy supplies such as dairy free butter. In all my baking I use the dairy free butter and I’ve never really thought anything of it, so unless there’s a specific flavour that’s been requested, the cakes or cupcakes are essentially dairy free.

I’ve never hidden the fact I use dairy free butter but I’ve also never made it a big deal either. Everyone always compliments the cakes and I’ve never had someone say they notice the cakes/icing etc were dairy free.

Last week I made a chocolate cake for my cousins birthday. We had a party and during the party I had a piece of cake (dark chocolate and cocoa powder are naturally dairy free so with dairy free butter the entire cake was dairy free) another cousin noticed me eating and commented on the fact that I would end up with a bad tummy. When I explained it was dairy free, she absolutely kicked off claiming I was trying to force my beliefs down everyone’s throat and that I should be declaring the fact it’s dairy free. Also should note, she had already eaten some cake and said it was lovely 🤷‍♀️ she started getting everyone involved. Some knew I tend to do dairy free and didn’t have any issue, others didn’t know and were still ok with it, and some were annoyed about it and said if they had known they wouldn’t have had the cake. Again no one disliked the cake in any way. I then got told from now on I should make sure there’s dairy in all the cakes, cupcakes and treats which means if it’s for a family event I can’t eat them.

Now I’m at the point where I don’t want to make anyone else anymore cakes for people. There was no maliciousness on my part. I understand that years ago, dairy free was a massive deal and quite often the food wasn’t tasty but nowadays things have changed. It’s not actually that big a deal anymore.

So AITA? Should I have been telling people that most of the cakes were dairy free?

  
\*\*edited to add as it’s been mentioned a few times- I always ask about any other allergies. theres a few different allergies in my family and I always try to cater to everyone. if there’s someone I don’t know that has an allergy they’ve often asked what they can eat and I direct them. In this case the only allergens in the cake was egg & wheat which no one In my family were allergic to. the butter used has no main allergens.

190bwx2,AITA for telling a doctor I don't need their consult?,"I was born with a cleft lip and had extensive surgeries to correct it. Now it's significantly less visible and the result was told to be impressive. On the unrelated note, I also have a wax issue with my ears so I have to see an ENT specialist doctor from time to time to get the wax removed.  
  
It happened to me before to have doctors (which are supposed to just remove my wax) to marvel at my cleft lip and the whole work done around it. For me it's weird because 1) I don't consider it THAT ground-breaking and 2) they're doctors, shouldn't they be more USED to that? However, I usually don't say much about it.  
  
Anyway cue doctor Jane who was supposed to remove my wax for the day. I scheduled an appointment SPECIFICALLY for that. She does it and then proceeds to ask me to open my mouth (although I told her the issue is with my EARS). I comply, foolishly imagining it's gonna be relevant to my problem but she begins talking about my cleft lip and how great the result is and wants to examine my nose point at which I stop her. I tell her there's nothing wrong with my nose and ask her if she suspects there might be an infection spreading to my ears or something. She says something like ""No, I just wanted to have a look and see more about your cleft lip..."". I stop her again (literally pushing her hands away) and keep asking if she's done with my ears. She says yes and KEEPS TRYING to see the work for my cleft lip.  
  
I told her to quit it, that I'm not sort of a museum piece that she gets to look at from all the sides and that for my cleft lip problems I see other doctors. Meanwhile I got up from the chair and started to get my stuff to leave. She said that there's no need to react like that and all she did was try to help me. I explained all the help I needed from her was with my ears and if I need more, I'll let her know. By then I was already dressed with the hand on the door handle.   
  
She kept telling me this is no way of behaving and I'm disrespectful to her. I (almost) snapped but told her as calmly as I could that for me this is not an ""interesting case"", but a lifelong condition and I'm not fond of people pointing fingers at it. I explained to her I find it unprofessional and rude. I then just left to avoid further conflict. Was I wrong?

1af2d42,AITA for asking my sister to leave because she took a nap after moving into my new house?,"I(F 23) recently bought a house. My partner and I spent 2.5 months remodeling as much of it as we could before our lease was up and we had to move in. We were over there almost every day working on it. It was really draining and I feel completely burned out. My sister(20) and friends helped us on weekends.

Fast forward to the move in date, I was so mentally, physically and emotionally drained at this point. Move in day went as smooth as moving does, we had friends to help us. My sister was going to help us but she had been asked to sing for a funeral which understandably was important for her and was at the same time we planned to move and so she planned to show up for the last part of it and stay to help us unpack.

She did exactly that and showed up as we were clearing out the last 10 boxes from the uhaul. She went to change and realized she didn't bring socks for her tennis shoes. She asked me for some and I was a little annoyed because NO, I can't find you socks right now. I have no idea where anything is  and I've been moving heavy things for the past 4 hours. I'm also disabled (I broke my pelvis when I was 17 and have mobility issues and chronic pain) and this day was really hard. She refused to do anything unless she had socks, so my boyfriend found some of his and gave them to her. She did put them on and helped with the last few boxes.

We all took a moment to eat lunch. My sister ate with us and our frineds left. My sister still planned to stay and help me unpack. I had to return the uhaul first, and I had to be the driver since I was the verified driver. I asked my sister if she would come with me to return the uhaul and she stated that she NEEDED a nap. She then proceeded to climb over all of the furniture we just moved in. She found a spot on the taken apart sectional and asked me to get her a blanket. I asked her again if she was sure she wasn't coming with me and she said no, she really needed a nap. She showed up for 20 minutes. It felt so inconsiderate. This is reacurring behavior and I feel like this was the final straw. There's history that's hard to get into. She never seems to care for anyone but herself.

I had to fill the uhaul up with gas before I returned it and got stuck trying to turn out of the gas pump area. It was a 20ft uhaul and I accidentally hit the side of it into a pole. No one was there to help me manuever it and I was doing the best I could. I was reallly upset that my sister didn't come with me because she could have helped me and this wouldn't have happened. I will have to pay for the damages.

When I got back to my house, she was still ""sleeping"" for another hour even though I was playing music and unpacking dishes loudly.

I asked for a reason but then she got defensive and started yelling at me and told me that it's her party and she doesn't want her step-siblings there.

She NEVER yelled at me before or even talked back so this really hurt me surprised me. I told her that if she doesn't want her step-siblings there, then there won't be a party. She then started crying and told me that she didn't ""fucking care.""

I talked to my kids and asked how they felt about their step sister because I thought that maybe she wasn't telling me something. However, the told me that they have no problems with her and were confused on why I asked. I shared this with my wife, and she supported my decision, and said that her daughters behavior was disrespectful. We both tried talking to her, but she's locked in her room, ignoring us and just crying. I decided to let her stay home today since she refused on coming out.

My wife  was aggravated and tried talking to her sister who sided with our stepdaughter. She said that she has the right to choose who attends her party. My wife stood firm with our decision, but her sister is threatening to tell to the rest of the family and I'm honestly worried and confused. 

I don't want my kids to feel excluded, and the thought of telling them they can't come hurts. I'm worried about whether our decision was right. The way my SIL acted made me question if I was actually in the right or not?

19boljy,AITA for locking my boyfriend out of the house?,"My boyfriend, Cody (27M) and I (25F) live together. However, I don't like it when his sister, Jessica (23) visits because 9 times out of 10 something in my closet always goes missing. I've confronted her and she admitted that she took some clothes (allegedly with my boyfriend's permission) because she likes my style and was hoping to return them. NONE have ever returned. So I talked to Cody and we agreed he should not allow her to come into our room when she visits, going as far as to lock whenever she's around.

That was nothing because she started taking other stuff from around the house, ranging from some food and at extreme, an entire kettle. I put a stop to this and threatened to open a theft case and that I didn't want her in the house anymore. Cody agreed with me and I thought we had an understanding.

Yesterday I came back home and at first I didn't notice but as I spent more time around the house, I noticed that some stuff was missing. This included a few pots dishes, cups, silverware, groceries and other honestly a lot more. I literally thought something broke in so I called Cody, who told me he lent Jessica his keys for her to take a few things from the house because she was supposedly ""having it rough"" lately. I argued that way more was taken and that he should have talked to me but he promised he would buy the stuff back.

It wasn't until I went to thoroughly look around our room for anything missing that I reached my breaking point because some of my clothes, hair dryer, straightener and unused lotions were gone. I called up my boyfriend again and he told me not to fuss about it as he was just gonna buy all of it again. I was beyond livid at that point.

When my boyfriend came back, I refused to let him in until he got back everything his sister took. He didn't take me seriously at first but I was not letting this go. It was either he got my stuff back or I would open a case. After about an hour, he left and he's slept over at Jessica's but is still yet to return. To no surprise, Jessica thinks I'm being petty.

Cody isn't taking my calls and I think I hurt him by refusing him entry. I'm afraid it may affect our relationship. Was I wrong?",mirror_flower,2018,771,0.9599999785423279,0.15651069474475096,1705791923,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19boljy/aita_for_locking_my_boyfriend_out_of_the_house/,2024,1
196tokp,AITA for refusing to speak to MIL and cancelling our wedding?,"I (f35) and fiancé (m30) are considering cancelling our wedding because of MIL

MIL has never tried to have a positive relationship with me. She makes sure I’m not included in conversations, belittles my achievements & talks down to me.

Things escalated when I was planning fiancés 30th. MIL fought me on every detail and accused me of not knowing my fiancé at all. (I planned a golf weekend away for him and his family) he loves golf. 

Fiancé confronted MIL and asked why she doesn’t like me? MIL admitted she doesn’t like me. (Doesn’t like my partner driving to events, didn’t like it took me a month to find employment when I moved to a different town to be with fiancé. Fiancé receives calls and texts from MIL daily. If he doesn’t respond, she blames me. 

Fiancé told her if she doesn’t stop this behaviour toward me he will no longer speak with her.

I agreed to meet with MIL to smooth things over and try to move forward. MIL never took me up on it. But things seemed ok for a time. 

Fast forward to fiancés brothers wedding. 

Wedding day arrives and we were to be at the venue at 4pm. Five minutes to 2pm fiancé receives call from MIL saying the family photo shoot is in 5 minutes. We hadn’t been told of a family photo shoot? MIL demands we arrive at 2pm for it. We frantically get ready and arrive at the house where the wedding was. There was never a photo shoot planned. MIL comes out and tries to hand my clothes to iron. I refused. 

MIL snaps at me asking where my son is. He was never coming. He’s at the hotel. MIL continues stating everyone thought he would be there. I respond he was never coming and we RSVP just us. She has been told multiple times he wasn't coming.

The ceremony is over & I started to have guests come up to me asking where my son is. I don’t even know these peoples names. I tell them he’s at the hotel. Looks of disgust are thrown at me. My new friends stopped talking to me. I realised these people were being told my son was at the hotel but not telling them how old he is (teenager)The wedding was a place of ridicule and disgust on me.

Christmas Day at MIL house. Her family scurry away from me on arrival, refusing to hug or greet me. One man, whom I had met once 2 years ago, aggressively accused me of leaving my son alone on Christmas Day. (Son was at fathers place this year). The rumour has continued and now not only does the MIL hate me, so do her family. 

I made up an excuse to announce the fact my son was a teenager whom just finished his first year of high school at the top of his class. Everyones jaw dropped. None of them knew he is a teen. MIL hurried out of the room.

Now fiancé wants to cancel wedding and elope because of MIL.

1999qzl,AITA for not giving up my plane seat?,"I 23 (f) recently had to fly across the Country to attend my sister Wedding. At the Airport there was a mom (around 40) with her little son (6 or 7) and the whole time she was demanding things from the airport staff. 
When we boarded the plane i went straight to my seat which was a middle seat, sat down and took out my earphones when the mother and the son arrived. 
They had the window seat and the seat and the aisle seat. Directly the woman demanded that she MUST sit next to her son and i MUST sit at the aisle so she could sit next to him.
 I dont like sitting in the aisle seat very much so i told her (friendly) that i dont really like giving up my seat as i dont like sitting there and she then started to yell that it is her right to sit Next to her son.
 I politely told her that i would be willing to change seats with her son (who had the window seat) and she continued yelling that she NEEDED the seat and that she wont accept that her son has to give up his seat as he is a child and deserves the window seat. In the end a Stewardess came and i got to sit in my originally seat. 
The mom kept 'accidentally' kicking me the whole flight and made her son annoy me on Purpose so i might give up my seat. 

When i went to the toilet i thought it was finally over as she might have accepted it but when i came back she was in my seat and my jacket and my bag which i left there were thrown into the aisle. I called a Stewardess and they made her get back onto her place.

1916dia,"AITA for not paying attention to the kids at my niece's(4) birthday party when the other adults left the room without making me aware that I'll be alone with the 7 kids, which resulted in an injured kid?","I (35f) love kids, always worked in child care jobs. During gatherings of friends or family I somehow always ended up in the kids room, helping the birthday boy and his friends assemble the new Playmobil fortress (because he asked me for help) or something like that. While the other adults eat cake around a table. Nothing wrong with them. I just always wonder how I got myself sitting on the floor surrounded by tiny humans.


But lately my health took a nosedive. Burnout and other stuff. I'm no longer good with noise and crowds or focus. I'm on disability because I can't work. My family knows this. 

When my niece had her birthday I was invited but I had a really, really bad day. I knew their apartment would be too crowded and noisy for me during the party, so I told my brother I had to cancel and come the day after. Discussing the reason, my brother convinced me to still come over for a little while, eat some cake and hug the birthday girl ""to show up and not disappoint her"". I made my limitations clear, that I can't help and that I might zone out. He said it'd be no problem.

When I came over, I sang happy birthday with them all, gave my niece her birthday hug and gift and sat myself in the living room with them, eating cake. The kids were playing, I didn't know the guest parents, it was as overwhelming as I suspected, so I stuck to my piece of cake and zoned out a little.

I don't know how much time had past, but the next thing I knew was that there was a scream from my niece and when I looked up, there were no more adults around, my niece had fallen down from a bar stool she had climbed and had a bloody knee (nothing more serious, luckly). When I got to her the other adults rushed in from the balcony a room over. My niece got checked over, got a bandaid and was already playing again 5 min after. But my brother asked me what happend and why I didn't prevent her from climbing. And when I told him I zoned out, he got angry and blamed me for her accident. 

It's a few days later now and I got several messages and calls from family, how irresponsible and asshole-y I am because I was not paying attention to the kids. I thought it wasn't my fault, because I wasn't made aware that I was the only adult left in the room. But I'm beginning to doubt my point of view. Am I the asshole here?",throwaway34578891,2857,293,0.9700000286102295,0.1498338066511209,1704670861,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1916dia/aita_for_not_paying_attention_to_the_kids_at_my/,2024,1
1ae8c67,AITA For telling my wife I don't want her sister at our house all the time,"My wife (38F) and I (39M) have been married for 12 years and have 3 kids (10, & 7-year-old twins).  About 8-months ago, my wife's sister Ann (29F) went through a pretty traumatic time.  She found out she was pregnant with her long-time BF of 6 years.  It wasn't planned, but that didn't lessen the heartbreak when she lost the pregnancy at 10-weeks.  To make things even worse, her BF left her 2 months later.  Ann lives about 15-minutes from us so obviously we were there to support her with anything she needed.  Neither my wife nor Ann are close to their parents at all so we are pretty much the only family Ann has.  

Ann was understandably heartbroken by what happened and was struggling pretty hard.  My wife was very diligent about making sure Ann didn't do anything stupid when her mental health was struggling so she pretty much included her in everything we did so she could keep an eye on her.  This included turning an extra room in our house into a bedroom for Ann.  The room had previously been a gaming/play room.  

For the past 6-months Ann has been staying at our house 4-5 nights a week.  She still has her own apartment, but she spends the vast majority of her time at our house and is included in pretty much all of our family plans.  

At first, I was understanding and knew my wife wanted to keep a close eye on Ann because she was struggling so bad.  But having another adult in our house pretty much all the time has been wearing on me.  Ann doesn't do much of anything to help around the house and anytime there is a mention of chores or cleaning, she will scoot off back to her apartment with some excuse.  Whenever I bring this up to my wife she will make excuses for Ann and say that she is a ""guest"" so we can't expect her to help around the house.  

Ann is also now very different around our kids.  She used to be a very involved and fun aunt and would babysit for us so we could have date nights.  But now, she refuses to be left alone with the kids for even short periods of time because she says it is bad for her mental health after what happened.  

The other day I asked my wife if she can ask Ann to watch the kids on Valentine's day so we can go out together and she refused and said I should know we can't ask that of her.  It started a fight between us about Ann and I expressed a lot of frustration with how Ann is always at our house and I don't like it.  I made the mistake of saying ""It's been 6-months, how much longer are we going to do this?""  That pissed off my wife and she called me a heartless asshole.  

Before anyone asks, yes Ann is in therapy and from what I can tell she is doing much better emotionally and mentally.  I've never said anything about this to her, but her BF breaking up with her was a blessing.  The guy was a loser and I don't think he would have been a good father.  

I understand my wife feels responsible for Ann, but I also feel like she has a responsibility to keep me happy too.  ",alwaysthereaita,2735,265,0.9599999785423279,0.14204400418303237,1706567595,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ae8c67/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_dont_want_her_sister/,2024,1
19e1hra,AITA for confronting my SIL that she was trying to make our wedding a showcase for her kids?,"My husband and I recently got married and I felt that my SIL tried to make our special day about her kids.

  
I proposed to my SIL's kids if they could be our flower girls for the special day. The kids were so excited and said yes! Everything seemed to go according to plan until two months before the wedding when my SIL asked me if the kids should have two dresses for two entrances (wedding ceremony & dinner reception). I told my SIL that the kids will only have one entrance, as our flower girls, during my wedding ceremony. My SIL looked upset and said ""they MUST walk during the dinner reception too."" Note that my wedding ceremony and dinner reception was at the same location and the wedding aisle was long (85ft long) so it takes some time to get from one end to the other (especially for kids).  
  
I am not the confrontational type, so I asked my husband to tell his sister that her daughters will only walk down the aisle once. My husband agreed and told his sister. My SIL disapproved and said to my husband that he is the kids' only beloved uncle and that her daughters will never get a chance to be flower girls again.

  
I thought everything was sorted out... until the big day. The wedding ceremony went as should and the flower girls were so beautiful; however, when the dinner reception time came and my husband and my entrance to the dinner reception was about to happen, the SIL inserted her kids in front of us with fresh baskets of rose petals. The SIL never told me nor my husband about this entrance.

  
I was blindsided. Turns out that my SIL went behind my back and told my MOH to tell the wedding MC (emcee) to announce the flower girls first to the dinner reception. The flower girls entered the dinner reception laying out a fresh set of rose petals down the aisle once more. While I was surprised, I was not angry (nor sad) because it was a special day and I did not want to let bad emotions ruin the day. I was also going to let the MC introduce and thank the flower girls during the reception anyways, so I did not mind.

  
This quickly changed when my SIL planned a surprise dance by the daughters in the middle of dinner as a gift to us. The MC once again announced the flower girls and they started dancing down the aisle onto the main stage again. So, all in all the kids ""walked"" down the aisle not once, not twice, but three times! My husband and I were supposed to have our first dance during this time, but instead her daughters danced on the stage, while my husband and I had our first dance on the side...

  
After the wedding I told my husband how upset I was at his sister and said she was trying to make the day about her kids. I confronted my SIL about this, but she shrugged it off and said that they were just kids and I am being a bridezilla/an a-hole. Instead my husband apologized on her behalf, which angered me more since it was not his fault.

19a2vih,AITA For Trying to Show My Houseguest How It Feels When She's Constantly Whale Tailing?,"okay, so i'm a stay at home mom, 36. We thought it would be a nice experience to host an exchange student, so a person from argentina has been staying with us. For the most part, things have gone great. She's in her sophomore year at a university nearby, and so she usually gets back from classes around the time my sons get home from school and we'll have dinner together, maybe do some tourism stuff on the weekends.

There's just one problem. one very awkward problem. For whatever reason, she doesn't seem to wear pants that fit her. That's the polite way of saying that her thong is always hanging out. I'm talking like manny santos levels of whale tail going on. I had no idea that it was back in trend, I had thought I had left those treacherous days behind me, but apparently it's back with a vengeance.

and just to be clear, I don't mean that her underwear is visible every once in a while when she bends over. I mean that her thong is right there, every time we get dinner in a resteraunt, or go golfing, or meet friends.
This places me in a pretty awkward position. she's 18, and she's not my kid, and it's against my general moral compass to tell other adults how to dress. however, I'm awfully tired of looking at a random persons bum floss in my own home.

I did try talking with her about it, but she brushes it off as if it was just an accident. 10 of 15 minutes later, I see her casually lift the band of her underwear so that it's back to being above her pants.

So, here's what I did about it. I needed to go run some errands and give her a ride to the the post office. Only, as soon as we arrived at the grocery store, her eyes went wide when I stepped out of the car. In the back of my drawer, I had found the loudest most bedazzled thong that I owned, and was wearing it a proud several inches above my own pants. I knew that the best way to make it uncool would be to adopt it myself.

I could see her dying inside, but I pretended not to notice and told her how seeing her thong made me remember back to the 90s, how it was so cute and I was inspired to try it again, how fun it would be to whale tail together etc etc. Needless to say, she didn't say very much for the rest of the evening. If her thong wasn't out of her pants, I would act pouty and tell her that it would be fun if we were matching. 

Since then, she's been really stand offish with me, to the point that other family members have noticed (nobody but me knows about my little prank). It's making me start to wonder if perhaps it was too far.

In the first semester her long distance boyfriend, who is 4 years older then us, came to visit twice. Once when I was away for the weekend and once during a break when I went home. Both times he stayed a day longer then I was away. The first time this happened I slept in my own bed sharing a room with them. The second time my roommate asked if I could give them alone time and I slept on my friends floor.

Recently she asked if I would be traveling this month and I said no. She informed me that she was hoping for her boyfriend to come visit and stay in our dorm room for 3 nights as hotels are expensive. I told her that I did't feel comfortable sharing a room with them for 3 days and didn't want to sleep on my friends floor again. She said that her friend has an air mattress I could borrow and I told her I didn't want sleep on a random persons air mattress nor did I want to impose on my friend and her roommates room for 3 days especially as she wanted him to come during a time when I have exams and need my room to study. I asked her if it would be possible for her to wait till spring break to see him or to visit him as he has his own apartment rather then him come here. She said she really wanted him to come here. And I repeated that I didn't want him to come. She then left the room.

When she returned it looked like she had cried and she told me that it makes her very sad when she can't see him for a long time and that I'm not letting her see him and that if my long distance bf came to visit she would gladly sleep in someone else's room.

1af13u3,"AITA for refusing to ""cover up"" in my own house?","I (f19) am fairly well-endowed. I have a size 40D chest that is pretty difficult to hide unless I layer.

This morning I walked out of my room in a 
tank top with no bra underneath. The tank top had one of those ""built-in"" shelf bras, but that is certainly not supportive enough for me, and my boobs don't defy gravity, of course. So, I had a lot of cleavage showing.

My mom (f50) was the first person I saw when I walked into the kitchen, and directly after saying hello to me, she added, ""you need to go put on a shirt, your dad is home and you have way too much showing."" I replied with ""I *have* a shirt on,"" and then changed the topic to food, since she was looking through the fridge.

We sat down to share a big sandwich, and at that moment my brother (m16) got home from school. He took a piece of the sandwich and started eating, hardly even looking in mine or my mother's direction. My mom repeated again, ""you *seriously* need to go cover up, you are way too obvious. Go put a shirt on.""

Again, I said, ""I have a shirt on."" She said, ""it's not covering you enough."" I said, ""yes it is, I'm sitting in the privacy of my own house."" She said, ""it's not *your* house, your male relatives are around."" I said, ""my male relatives shouldn't be looking at me in that way."" (Mind you, my father was nowhere to be seen and my brother was silent.)

She got up from the table in a huff, rambling angrily as she put things back in the kitchen. She said that I am disrespectful and insinuated that I think I know everything because I am a legal adult. She ended her monologue with, ""get a clue about the real world."" 

I didn't say anything to that, because I was confused. The real world? We are not talking about walking around in public, we are talking about sitting at home in comfortable clothes.

She was still standing in the kitchen when I went to put my plate away, and as I washed it, she said, ""you know, that's like if your brother was sitting in the living room with his testicles hanging out of his shorts, refusing to cover himself because it's 'his house.'"" I started to say that I am certainly not exposing my genitals, but I couldn't get more than two words out before she said, ""no. No. You want to be disrespectful, don't talk to me."" She headed downstairs and I went to my room.

The thing is, my chest size did not magically happen. I had to get these genes from *somewhere,* and that somewhere is my mom! Hers are even bigger than mine, and absolutely nobody makes a fuss when she sits at the dining table with no bra under her tank top. Because there's no sane reason to. 

My opinion: sexualizing your family's bodies by telling them to cover up, lest their father/brother/son state? That is weird. I should be able to be physically comfortable in my own house. But this isn't the first time she has said something like this, so am I the asshole?",WolfAndAHalf,1188,712,0.8500000238418579,0.11532867581794332,1706652997,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1af13u3/aita_for_refusing_to_cover_up_in_my_own_house/,2024,1
190ccru,AITA for telling my boyfriend he deserved to get humbled.,"I (18F) and my boyfriend (19M) have been dating since we started college in October 2021. For the past I’d say 8 months my bf has become very interested in UFC (mma? idk what to call it). He gets up at like 3AM to watch fights and often has play fights with his friends one of these friends are important in this situation (I’ll call him S). We had a very large group of friends,we all graduated in summer but we all kept in touch over summer until now. Now these play fights or “spars” as my bf would say were all fun and games but they actually led my bf to believe he could actually fight because S (who says he does mma) said he’s naturally good. 

This led to a massive ego and he said he wanted to have a actual fight, and one of our other friends dad owned a gym with ring and he said he could let him fight there (idk if that was even legal). S proposed a guy for him to fight and it was a guy back from school I’ll call A. S was friends with A(not close friends) and I knew A because we used to sit next to each other in class. S said he’ll try get a hold of him. A agreed, shockingly. 

When A agreed I did express some concern to my bf (multiple times) and he didn’t listen. A was a quiet guy, but as we sat next to each other for a year I knew probably more than others about him, he was pretty much just one of those traditional masculine males in a physical sense, worked out 6 days a week, rode horses and did archery, owned large dogs but was one of those guys that looked intimidating but was actually a nerdy and friendly guy. My bf didn’t like A or A’s friends, and neither did the rest of the boys in our friends group. I always questioned my bf on this as A had literally never even spoken to him, and my bf used to say it’s because A is so arrogant and thinks he’s so good looking, this led to a lot of arguments with my bf, because why did my bf care if other women were attracted to A when he had me?

Nobody knew if A could fight but S said he told him something about he had been training in some form of martial arts. The whole build up to this my bf was acting so childish, he’d constantly try insult A in a group chat that was made and A wouldn’t even open them 90% of the time and I dont think he responded once. When the fight came along there was only one outcome from the start,  A was visibly towering over my bf, and he had clearly bulked up. On top of that, turned out he could fight, my bf lost in i’d say 90 seconds.

1958726,AITA for refusing to eat my food because my aunt put stuff on it,"My aunt lives pretty far away and my parents and I were staying with her, my uncle and 2 cousins for a week. They’re like really obsessed with eating healthy food so they only have organic stuff and like no sugar. They also live in the countryside and there’s only one little shop near them to get food from (unless you order online which is what they do.) I’m autistic and there’s a lot of food i don’t like. I’m not picky or anything and i still eat healthy stuff but i just hate a lot of foods too.

My aunt had nothing that i like eating (apart from a few little things) so i mainly just had pot noodles from the shop (they didn’t sell much i like either) but i don’t mind because pot noodles are my favourite food because they always taste the same they never change it’s great.

My aunt offered to make me a pot noodle because i was looking after my cousins when i went to eat it though she’d put lettuce and peppers and stuff in it. Basically making it into a salad. I don’t hate salad i just don’t want it in my noodles it ruins it and it makes it taste different and ew. I told her i’m not eating it and i got kinda upset at her for messing with it. She told me that i was being unreasonable and she was just trying to make me something healthier. My parents agree with her and said i should apologise.

My sister, her husband, and my niece come to my house almost every weekend. This weekend, my daughter had committed to my niece to help her put together a lego set. They arrived at our house and when they came in my daughter was playing a game, my niece was eating some dinner they’d brought for her and my sister was eating but also was clearly expressing some anger/frustration with her husband who was in the family room playing video games with my husband. This was the plan all along— for our husbands to play games and my daughter and niece to build legos. It was super early in the night (maybe 5:30/6ish) so there was a lot of time for everyone to get to everything because they are usually here until 10:30 or 11 on a weekend. 

My niece finishes her food and my sister was fussing. I actually said to my husband I may leave and run some errands because I don’t like the energy in here. I packed up the food my niece didn’t finish and put it in a bag for her. My niece starts to open the legos. She’s 7 and capable to start this task—- we were letting her do her thing. My daughter was still playing her game. 

My sister says “Sarah, are you going to get up? Jane is opening everything and she’s ready.” Sarah responded that she was coming in just a bit. My sister goes in and starts helping my niece and says “well now you need some scissors. I thought the teen almost young adult was going to get up and help you”. 

This is when I chimed in with, “Sarah doesn’t have to hop up just because Jane is done eating and ready. She will be in in just a minute” and I put the pair of scissors on the table. 

After about 3-4 minutes Sarah goes in and starts helping. My sister is on the phone and grumbling about something else and then says “oh Sarah it’s okay I don’t want your mom to think I’m forcing you to come help”. 

I respond, “hey that’s not really necessary” and try to explain that I was just saying they both could be patient while Sarah finished what she was doing. My sister cuts me off and I say “listen whatever you’re upset about you don’t need to take it out on me.”

She proceeds to start yelling and cursing at me. Telling me I need to shut the fuck up and I really need to not take this to another level because she’s already not in the mood and she about to “go there” with me. 

Without yelling I say, “you need to go. You gotta go home.”  

She says fine and said “I didn’t want to come over here today anyway.” I didn’t say anything and let them leave. 

Later my husband says “you and your sister ruined us(him and my brother in law) hanging out.” I asked okay but was I wrong? I don’t think anyone should be able to come in my home and disrupt my peace because they are in a bad mood. 

My husband responded “you don’t put family out of your house”.

1961ihz,AITA for prioritizing my mother’s feelings over my wife’s disdain?,"AITA for prioritizing my mother’s feelings over my wife’s disdain.

My father died unexpectedly in an accident last year. He was only 50. 

My wife (30) has had issues with my mom for the past 3 years. While we were dating, my mom made the comment that she didn’t feel we were “right for each other”. Since then, there has been a heaviness around them. Mom has apologized and always says I love you. But my wife hasn’t really accepted and has not ever said “I love you back”. She doesn’t accept the apology and thinks it only came after we were married because she had “no choice but to accept [her].”

Fast forward: my wife and I move 20 minutes from my mom after my dad dies due to a job change. Tonight, my siblings made plans for the family to eat dinner in the city- about 1.5 hours away. The weather’s a little dicey, so my mom called and asked if we could ride together. She could meet at our apartment, and then we could drive into the city together. 

My wife told me to tell her “no” and that she’s a grown woman and can drive herself. That giving her a ride we are enabling her “helplessness”. My father did everything for my mom including driving through bad weather and into the city. 

My wife and I got into it and I told her we are giving my widowed mother a ride to see her kids and grandkids.

1af24np,"AITA for ""keeping score"" with my family and ruining dinner?","I (27m) am the 3rd of 4 siblings and have always felt like an afterthought. Laurie (33f), Chuck (29m), and Jade (25f) have always gotten the first and best from my parents and each other. I get the leftovers if I'm lucky. I haven't gotten a birthday present from any of my siblings in about 10 years, but I still get asked to pitch in for group gifts for each of them every year.

On Friday night we were having a family dinner and it honestly felt like every other sentence was a dig at me or a less than subtle brag by my siblings about something they have been given by my parents that I was denied.  They talked about how nice almost all of our weddings were, but made sure to mention it was ""ok"" that my wife and I had a small low-key wedding. And it was Ok, we loved it. But they brushed over the fact that my parents paid for all of my siblings weddings... but not mine. Because somehow they couldn't afford it... because they were saving up for Jade's wedding.

​They brought up how little student loans they have… because my parents helped them. All of them lived on campus at expensive 4 year schools. I lived at home and went first to a (very prestigious, very hard to get into) watchmaking school. I got paid to attend this school… so I paid rent at home. My parents paid for my tools. And I appreciate the help. I really do. But they paid 120-150k each for my siblings... they gave me 7k for tools. But to them it’s equal. When I went back to school on my own I didn’t ask for money and wasn’t offered it. When my brother went back to school they covered EVERYTHING without him even having to ask.

There were many other small moments (comments about cars and other lifestyle choices) but what made me snap was my brother and his wife mentioning their marriage being so great because they do things like spontaneous dates, like the one they had the prior Friday night. The Friday night where my parents called my wife and I last minute to cancel plans they had to eat dinner at our house because they had to watch Chuck's kids because of an ""emergency"". Turns out that ""emergency"" was a dinner for Chuck and my SIL at Texas Roadhouse. I had spent HOURS making my grandpa's ziti and meatballs with homemade marinara because its my mom's favorite. 

I wanted more than anything to scream at them but instead I got up and left without saying a word and my wife followed me. when my mom called me later to ask why I left I just explained exactly why. I explained the favoritism, the unfairness, and the fact that it doesn't feel like they care about me. She didn't say much and I wasn't really looking for an explanation or an apology in the moment, I just felt like it was self evident but if she really didn't see it I'd spell it out. Evidently at least parts of what I said have been shared with my siblings because now Chuck and Laurie are furious at me and saying I ruined dinner and my mom is upset that I am hurt. They say I'm immature for ""keeping score""

In this I had one request as she won’t be getting them for a while I ask that when she does get them check in with me, and show me what she’s getting.

However she continued to blow up and say that I should support her no matter what, I said I would and I do but I don’t think letting me know and not surprising me with something like this is that big of a deal.

1adfrs7,AITA For not wanting to claim this child as my (half) sibling,"Alright so I, 20M, have 4 siblings (T 22, N 17, D 6 and M 3, all F). D and M are half siblings from my dad’s second marriage , but T, N and I all regard these two kids as our sisters, and we don’t care about the “half” aspect of it. 

Important information before continuing. 

1. My mum is still alive. Parents split around 8 years ago. Dad was unfaithful and manipulative so mum left with the kids. He is also a narcissist. 
2. I have a good relationship with dad’s wife. She’s a great mother to my sisters. They live together and I video call them very often. When we’re in the same city, we’re always hanging out with these kids. 
3. Contact with my dad is very very low. 
4. Dad didn’t pay child support for us…mum did it herself. 
5. T and I left for college three years ago and three months ago respectively. 
6. We’ve known about the unborn love child for 6 months, but he only told us about it in the last 24 hours. 

Here’s the mess. 

Dad had an affair with some new (married) woman. Don’t know who she is (dgaf either). He is still married to my step mother, but there have been murmurs that she may leave with the two girls. He’s essentially broken up the marriage again, in the same way he broke his first marriage. He wants his kids to have a relationship with this new child, and we’re all refusing, as this child is the product of his affair with another married woman. While we weren’t thrilled about our parents’ divorce, we accepted his wife and their kids as our little sisters. We have solid relationships with them. His justification for his affair is that he “didn’t plan it” and that it “wasn’t meant to happen”. He doesn’t want this child to grow up without his “family”. He claims his wife is gonna raise the baby with him and his AP gonna give up parental rights (we know it’s bullshit.) He also claims his wife was cool with the matter (also bullshit). 

We have told him that we don’t want anything to do with his love child or his affair partner and that they have no place claiming siblinghood or any sort of family status, given that he wasn’t supposed to be fucking other women since he’s married. He wishes for this kid to have the same privileges that my youngest two sisters have (we take them out, we spoil them, etc) but this kid won’t get those perks. That’s his mess.

After we left the diner, my gf screamed at me for being a ""giant piece of shit,"" for not only not doing the right thing myself but also not letting her do it.

19e1en8,AITA For going on holiday with my grandchildren and without my daughters partners children?,"My daughter, Alice, has two children, one is with her current partner, Liam. He has three children from a previous relationship.

To celebrate my youngest child’s 21st birthday,  I was planning a surprise holiday for us all to Disneyland. I found a great flight deal and was keen to get it booked. Prior to booking the holiday I spoke to Liam on the phone I told him my plan and asked him about his three children from the previous relationship coming. It was decided he’d speak to their mother, who is a very difficult character, to ask her permission. I booked the flight deal for 5, resigned to the fact that the flight cost would increase for the remaining 4 flights. 

The flights are over the Easter holiday, and Liams Ex has said the children cannot come. She wants to do an egg hunt with them. Liam wants to move the holiday to suit his ex. The dates suit my daughter whose 21st Birthday we are celebrating, and of course the cheap flight deal is a factor also.

This has all backfired onto me because Liam is disappointed they can’t go, he says the other two shouldn’t go. He claims I am not treating the family the same, and has completely overlooked the conversation I had with him before booking, and the subsequent messages I have sent regarding an update on the booking.

What should have been a lovely surprise for everyone has been ruined by Liams fury at his ex partner.

So am I the asshole for booking the deal flights for my children and grandchildren and not waiting for response from his ex about their three children?
