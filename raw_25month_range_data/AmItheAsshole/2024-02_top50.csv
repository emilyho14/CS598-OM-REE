1b2kw13,AITA for telling my mom I will move out vs paying $600 a month rent?,"I'm 25 years old, was paying $60 a week rent for a few years. I recently started a new temp job that pays pretty decent, and they decided to keep me with the company last week. This morning my mom texted me to say “Rent starts up again, $150 a week”. 

I just told her I will move out. I already pay for my own meals, I only have my small bedroom to call my own in their house. I can rent a studio apartment 3 or 4 times the size of my room for a few hundred more, or could rent a room with friends for less than my mom is trying to charge me. It would be one thing if they cooked and cleaned for me every day and I was raking up their bills but I do my own thing, pay my own bills, I never really even cross paths with my parents besides when I am getting off work. 

My moms definitely pissed that I said that, I can tell. But I'm also upset the person who birthed me is trying to get me to pay what I would pay a landlord for rent just to sleep in her house.  Even 100 a week I would have been more inclined to be okay with, but 600 a month just to be able to sleep at my parents house seems a little high. If I am paying $600 a month I think I would deserve my own spaces around the house also as I would with a landlord, it seems having a landlord would be a better deal for me in this case.

1agotpu,AITA for saying “you should’ve thought about that before you procreated”?,"My ex and I have a 13 year old daughter, “Nicole”. Nicole has several medical conditions that require a lot of attention. She will need some sort of in home assistance for the rest of her life. While we have an aide to help a couple of days a week, it is still a challenge. The outcome of Nicole’s condition became clear when she was 2. At that point, my ex and I agreed we wouldn’t have more kids because it wouldn’t be fair to anyone. There’d be no way we could focus attention on two kids. Someone would lose out in this situation.

We divorced when Nicole was 5. We originally had 50/50 custody. 3 years later, my ex remarried. His new wife, Callie, is nice. My ex did say that she didn’t understand the severity of Nicole’s condition . I figured there was a learning curve. Eventually, Callie basically said she wanted to be hands off. Which I respected, though I wondered how it’d work considering Nicole lives with them half the time. 

Last year, my ex and Callie had a baby. I was a little surprised given my ex was always firm on not having more kids but figured it wasn’t any of my business. He did begin to complain that it was a lot of work juggling Nicole and the baby. I sympathized but really didn’t know what else to say.

Recently, the venting got worse. He said Callie yelled at him for taking Nicole to her physical therapy appointment instead of helping her with the baby. He brought up potentially having Nicole stay with me more. I wasn’t entirely shocked but it pissed me off. I said Nicole was his daughter. He can’t just abandon that responsibility. He asked what he was supposed to do about the baby. 

I said “maybe you should’ve thought of that before you procreated? I mean, really, we discussed this 10 years ago as to why it’d be hard to juggle two kids. Why did you think having another would be a good idea?” He got quiet and said Callie wanted a baby. I said that isn’t enough of a reason and maybe he should’ve thought harder before bringing more life into this world. 

The conversation ended with me saying I’d call my lawyer and we could arrange for him to have less custody as I’d rather my daughter be properly cared for than be viewed as a burden.

Callie called me that night very upset that I had made my ex cry and that I said her baby shouldn’t exist. I said that’s not what I said completely, more that they didn’t think it through. She called me a jerk.

1b01blt,AITA for ordering food that my husband can’t eat?,"I 28f have been with my husband 28m for 9 years, married for 2 this summer. We have a daughter who is 7 years. We rarely even fight, and if we do it has been more major and serious things, but this, what to me was a small issue is now turning into the biggest argument we have ever had.

So the problem is that me and our daughter loves LOVES spicy food, I always have and ever since I felt comfortable with her trying it, she has loved it too. Sure we couldn’t compete in a spice eating contest and even though our tolerance is high, it is not extreme. But my husband, he hates it, he is one of those people who thinks spice is unnecessary and only likes to use salt and pepper. This is not a problem, sometimes I make a batch that suits his taste, another one for me and our daughter. Sometimes me and our daughter will just eat how it is to his liking, as too little spices is easier to handle than to much as it would be for him. 

Now this Saturday he was away with friends to go pick up some car parts, it was a 12 hour drive in total, and they left at about 9. I went ahead and ordered from a Indian place that our daughter has as her favorite, my husband also likes this place and just orders something mild when we eat from there. Since my husband was not home, I did not order him anything as I thought that they would’ve eaten on the road. When he got home, he greeted us then immediately went to the fridge and saw some boxes left of food. When he opened them, he obviously noticed he could not eat any of them.

Now we argued just for about 5 minutes of this, the consensus of the argument was him saying that I should’ve either thought about him and ordered him something, or I should’ve asked him if he had eaten or wanted anything. I argued that I would’ve probably done so if it was just for a few hours he was away, but he was away for over 12 hours and came home about 4 hours after we usually eat, so I assumed he had eaten. 

Now he has barely talked, he cooked his dinner for himself because in his words “I can’t be bothered”, he texted me from the living room when I was cooking for me and our daughter that he hoped I was happy to have my food my way now. He is extremely weird about this, he has never ever acted this way about something like this and I am getting even more confused by it all.

1an0foy,AITA for assuming my friends were paying for my birthday meal?,"This happened a few days ago and I have been conflicted since.   
Before my birthday, five of my friends asked if I would like to get some food and drinks out for my birthday event. I said sure where would we go Mike said ""Anywhere you like"".  
I suggested a nearby Steakhouse that I have been to in the past.  


We all met each other there, Mike was quick to order himself a drink and started talking about appetizers. I said I don't normally eat them but I will try one.  
We ordered our mains and we all had ordered the steak and another round of drinks at which point Adam also ordered a bottle of champagne. I said you guys don't need to get me Champagne it's only my birthday nothing too special when Mike said ""Lighten up birthday boy have some fun"" I did think maybe I was being too uptight and since I was being treated it's not too big of a problem I may as well celebrate.  


Mike started arguing with the table next to us because they threw a french fry at him. I tried to explain to him that they weren't even eating french fries he had them earlier and must have dropped one. Then he stood up and started swearing at the table. there was a child at the table about 3 years old who looked absolutely shocked. I told Mike to sit down and he started pushing me saying ""That man threw something at me"" The waiter came over and said there had been complaints against us. 

Mike just silently drank his beer and Adam started arguing with the waiter saying the other table started it. The waiter said we needed to pay up and leave in the next few minutes before there was a problem. 

I said ""Thanks guys do you want me to help pay"" At which point they all looked at me and Adam said ""You're the birthday man right? you got money"" I said ""I thought you were inviting me because it's my birthday as a present"" Adam chuckled a bit and said, ""Weren't you the one that chose where we were going bud?"" 

Adam got up to leave and said ""Let's go boys"" I started to worry I thought they were pranking me or something and said ""You can't really go"" Then Adam started to walk away So I grabbed him a bit and he looked at my hand and said  ""Get your hand off me pal"" I just looked at him and said, ""Why are you acting like this man?"" They walked out and left me with the bill.

&#x200B;

 I tried to explain to the waiter about the situation. He said ""Someone's gotta pay and your table was causing a lot of trouble tonight"" I tried to apologise but he just looked at me like I was dirt. So I just paid it was most of my money.

 I spoke to my friends after and they just acted like nothing happened I said ""You guys need to pay me back"" and I got several replies along the lines of It's already over leave it. 

&#x200B;

So I haven't spoken to them in a few days I received a few messages asking me if ""I am still crying"" or if ""I grew up yet?"" I haven't replied and I want to know if I was wrong to assume that I wouldn't be paying. The whole situation had me feeling weird.",Throwawayguy980421,5818,1874,0.9300000071525574,0.4297767620268462,1707517413,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1an0foy/aita_for_assuming_my_friends_were_paying_for_my/,2024,2
1alg5zg,AITA for asking my boyfriend to skip his afternoon nap.,"I'm 26F, hes 30M. We've been dating for 3 years but just moved in together 6 years ago. 

I have felt crazy busy since moving in together. I work outside of the house, commute for an hour a day, and I'm going to school part time to try and get a better job, so my schedule is already packed, but since moving in together it feels like my time spent doing chores has almost doubled. 

I talked with my boyfriend about this hoping that we could come up with a reasonable chore schedule, but hes adamant that hes doing as much as he has the capacity to do. 

Something else I've noticed since moving in together is that he takes a nap from 4pm-8pm daily. He otherwise sleeps through the night usually 1am-10am, but that afternoon nap is like clockwork.

Long story short, I told him that he is getting 14-15 hours of sleep every day, and that he can start making more time to help around the house by even shortening that nap. I dont even think that amount of sleep it healthy. But he insists its a necessary part of his day and that im crossing a boundary by suggested that he not nap.

1b1oo52,AITA for 'taking up all the attention' at my SIL's baby shower?,"I (33F) am an OB/GYN and I've been travelling around different parts of the world on missions with MSF. Long story short, I hadn't been home in 15 months.  (For some context, I decided to join due to a depressive episode after my ex-girlfriend broke up with me but I ended up loving it and I just kept going on missions for 15 months. My ex-girlfriend is a good friend of my sister in law, Penny.) 

I decided to take some time off and come back for a while before deciding on what's next for me. I returned 2 weeks ago. My brother (I'll call him Harry - 34M) and his wife (Penny - 28F) are expecing their first child. They had scheduled a baby shower for yesterday, and obviously Penny invited me.

Family members and some of Harry's old friends and were asking me questions about different missions ans why I left for charity while I could earn a fortune here, was it hard being a woman in those areas etc. I gave them short answers but they asked more questions.

Penny subtly asked for me to talk one-on-one in the middle of the party. She told me I was monopolizing everyone's attention and taking up everyone's time and no one was paying attention to the purpose of this gathering due to my being there. 

I apologized and asked her if she wanted me to leave. She said I had been enough of a distraction, and told me to please leave early. I left about half an hour after this talk. So far everything's good. 

The next day Harry called me and told me I had been a rude guest the day before, because I had ruined their first child's baby shower. He said I should have kept quiet or at the very least left the party the moment Penny asked me to. Was I a. AH?

1agpmqm,AITA for telling my SIL/best friend that she overshadowed my wedding?,"Burner account. I(29F) am married to ""Nate""(29M) and his sister his ""Denise""(29F) we are all childhood friends and I married Nate almost a year ago. Denise, at the time was 7 months pregnant with her first child, her husband is ""Wayne""(30M). Not too long after our reception started, Denise went into preterm labor. Her pregnancy up until that point was not high risk so this was completely out of nowhere and stunned all of us. She understandably had to leave with Wayne to the hospital and most of their side of the family left out of concern. She insisted we stay and have fun and lord knows Nate and I tried but knowing that she was in unexpected, high risk labor was at the forefront of our minds and we made the difficult decision to end the reception about  an hour and a half early and joined up at the hospital.

My nephew ""Ben"" was born that night and we were all excited but I'll admit Nate and I felt a bit miffed that our wedding day was kind of stolen by this event. We kept this to ourselves though, as this was obviously unplanned and it's cruel to put that on Denise and Wayne. But, from that point on nobody ever talked about our marriage, just baby Ben. The times I think a relative mentioned our wedding can be counted on one hand. I get it, new additions to the family are ultimately more important but my wedding day will never just be about my wedding, it'll be about Ben, and whenever he comes up  or I see him I feel bitter because I'm reminded of what happened at the wedding. Yes, I know I'm jealous of a baby. I feel like shit for it. Nate was like this too for a while but grew out of it, I'm still working on it.

Ben is turning 1 in 2 weeks and that's all everyone's talking about, not a peep about our anniversary. I already know I'll just be depressed and mopey the whole time so I asked if Nate could politely tell him I would not be there. He did and Denise was pretty upset and demanded to know why, he refused, so she confronted me via text. She told me that she's picked up on how I seem sad whenever Ben is mentioned and said I'm hurting her that I can't tell her why. I decided to be honest and tell her that I've been very depressed(not just for this issue, but it's contributing) and that I felt that my wedding was overshadowed by her unexpected labor. I did tell her I'm not mad at anyone because it was unplanned, I just need to not be reminded of it on my anniversary. She did not respond and just blocked me, but Wayne uninvited Nate and told him to keep him and I far away from his family. Nate's confused and I feel like shit. AITA?

1b0wndk,AITA for Asking My Niece to Stop Speaking French Around My Dyslexic Wife?,"My wife (28F) Sarah and I (M30) have been married for five years. She's incredible, loving, and my favourite person in the world. Now, my entire family has tradition of learning and speaking French. It's always been a fun way for us to bond. However, for Sarah, it's been a bit of a challenge.

Sarah has tried for years to pick up the language, but due to her dyslexia, she's found it extremely difficult. It's been a great source of frustration and insecurity for her, especially when we're around my family who like to speak French with each other.

My niece (17F), Eva, is staying with us for a while. She's speaks English and French too, and understandably speaks a lot of French around the house. While I understand its just a normal thing for her, it's been a bit upsetting for Sarah. She feels excluded from our conversations and she's started trying to brush up on it but its just stressing her out and hitting a nerve.

Given the situation, I approached Eva and asked if she could try to speak more English around my wife. I explained that it wasn't about controlling her choices but about helping Sarah feel more comfortable and included in conversations.

Unfortunately, Eva didn't take it well. She accused me of prioritizing Sarah's difficulties over her comfort and claimed that I was asking her to suppress her identity.

1aokcnh,AITA for telling my bio moms family that I don't visit because I don't have a bed there,"I've lived with my dad my entire life. He married my mom when I was 2 and she's all but adopted me (15f). 

My bio mom lives about 5 miles away with her husband and their kids (12f and 8m). I don't live with her, never have, and probably never will. I visit her sometimes, like once a month, but we both know she's not my mom. I've called her by her first name since I was like 5. I don't have a room or a bed at her house and there's no pictures of me in there. 

My bio mom talked me into going to some family party with her and her family. I don't know anyone there so I was mostly just hanging out with her while I was there. She started talking about how I never see her and it took an act of god to get me to go to this party so I told her to show them my room. She tried to show them her daughter's room so I said ""no, that's Amanda's room, see the A by her bed?"" and she was out of rooms after that because it's only a 2 bedroom house. She pulled me aside and said to stop and that I was making her look bad so we went back and I told her siblings that I wasn't allowed to talk about not having a bed at her house anymore because it makes her look bad. 

Apparently that wasn't good enough either because she tried telling me to give her my phone. I reminded her that she's not my mom then called my mom and told her to pick me up.

1ahh5yk,"AITA for not ""just dropping it"" and putting a blanket veto on all TV show names for our son?","Me and my wife are having our first kid soon and know it is going to be a boy. It's been hard to come to an agreement on names—she is very firm on picking a name that we both agree on, but we pretty much have opposite taste. I have a very very basic and common first name, which I like, so I gravitate towards simple and classic names like James, William, and Daniel. She likes...not that.

She suggested the name Dean the other day and I was considering it, until I found out she picked it because it was the name of her teen TV crush. She dug in her heels and insisted that she just liked the name and wasn't gonna name her kid *after* the character, and watching an old episode of the show just reminded her of the name. I'm like...that is *exactly* what ""naming your kid after a TV character"" means. 

So I said how about this, I am gonna give you a preemptive blanket veto on TV show names. I don't want to hear suggestions for a little Zuko or Sherlock or anything like that, and literally any other name is on the table. Is that fair? And she said ""NO"" that is not fair and I'm being a dick and putting words in her mouth.

We were all done and ready to go but Elizabeth hadn't fully eaten yet. It was getting late so as people started leaving, my husband and I also decided to leave as it was getting late. We didn't wait for Elizabeth to finish her dinner.

We recently got our first home and are officially homeowners so a few weeks ago we decided to throw a big party with family and friends. We did have a bunch of alcohol drinks and mixed drinks, but I had them separated bc my SIL is 3 months pregnant. 

My SIL has had 4 miscarriages in the past. It’s heart wrenching, and I feel horrible for her. I’ve always been supportive.  She has a form of PCOS.  Anyways at the party I had told SIL that the non alcohol drinks were in the indoor fridge, and to feel free to make herself virgin drinks if she liked. On the table outside I had mixed drinks outside and in the outside cooler. Long short short  sister in law ended up getting trashed, a week later miscarried. She’s been blaming my husband and I since early January for this. Sending us hateful messages spamming my phone, saying one of us must’ve mixed up the drinks (which didn’t happen.) When it first occurred I told her I was so sorry, but it wasn’t our fault we had other guest who were drinking and I had made her aware of where the other drinks were.

She is a stay at home mom, in charge of all the housework and childrearing while I work and cover us financially. Before you start attacking me, hear me out. We ran into a bit of bad luck with debt a few years ago and as a result, on average I work 50-60 hour weeks to help get us out of it. I am a carpenter so the days are long and sometimes I drive quite a bit to get to the work sites. By the time I get home, I am exhausted and pretty much eat then collapse into bed.

On saturdays I take my son and daughter out to his soccer games then back home for lunch, while my wife goes to bookclub, lunch with her friends then usually some sort of hike or yoga class. She is back by mid-afternoon at which point she takes back over the kids and I make dinner, maybe do a bit of laundry and clean the floors. On sundays it is reversed. I go out with my mates, by mid afternoon, I return, we have our baby sitter come around and we spend the night together. 

Recently my wife has come to me saying that I need to start doing more around the house. That I need to do more cleaning, organising, looking after the kids, grocery shopping, cooking. I know that she does a lot and I am in no way saying she doesn’t deserve a break, but I am working really hard too. Especially at the moment. I feel like I do the best I can with how much work I’m doing. I know there is a lot in social media right now about men not doing enough at home, but I never thought I was one of those guys. 

I explained this to her and she said I was being ridiculous. That I spend all day having fun at work with my workmates, while she deals with the children and all of the house chores. Then I get home and just eat and go to bed. This isn’t the plan for forever, but I thought it was going alright for now.

Am I the asshole?

I look everything to do with my my sons sports stuff aside from driving him to Wednesday practice since I’m at work, same with my daughters swimming lessons. On those Saturday’s I make lists of groceries I think need to be picked up (though admittedly she decides what she wants to cook so has the final say), I go round and empty the laundry baskets/pick up stuff and wash/dry/fold them. I make the Saturday dinner (which is my job to plan and put stuff on the list for). I take care of all the bills, car payments, insurance dates. 

I do ask my wife before I go to bed if she needs anything else done before I crash, which yes I get the mental load thing but I figured if she needed extra help she’d ask, usually she says no. I guess in the mornings I could start making my sons school lunch while I make mine and also my daughters when she starts this year. 

When she expressed her need for help it was nothing specific and when we had this discussion she did not give me any specific examples and even if she did I leave at 5am and I’m not usually back til 730. I get home and shower, eat and put laundry into the machine, unpack my work gear, I play/read/clean up our kids and I’m in bed by 830. I don’t know physically how to find more time to contribute on weekdays.",ThrowRA_boiyy,3455,1788,0.9200000166893005,0.3301694747506667,1708730822,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ayf6xz/aita_for_not_helping_my_wife_around_the_house/,2024,2
1b02yjt,"AITA for calling my wife irresponsible, possibly being overprotective of my daughter?","Hello, I don't really know how to start this, I'm sorry if there are any mistakes, English is not my first language.

I'm 37M. I live with my wife, Jen, 37F and our two kids,13F and 7F. Last weekend, my wife went out for the day with our oldest daughter, who for this story I will call Emily, while I stayed home with our youngest.

Three hours after they left, I got a call from Emily. She was very upset on the phone and was crying. She explained that they went to a clothing store together, they split up to look at different sections and now Jen is no where to be found and her phone is going to the voicemail. She had asked an employee to make an speaker announcement and no one has come forward, and Jen had been gone for around an hour.

I told Emily not to panic and I come straight down. When I got there, Jen was still gone, and I couldn't see her car in the parking area. We searched for Jen in the stores that are next-door in case she went in one of them, and I also try to call her.

Around 40 minutes later, Jen calls me and says she is on her way back to the clothing store. I asked where she had been, and she says she drove to another nearby store that she wanted to go to. I asked why she didn't bring Emily or at least tell her that she was leaving, and she said because she did not expect to take a long time or for Emily to even notice that she was gone.

Emily has been distraut and avoiding Jen, she is still very upset.

When we got home, Jen and I had an argument as I said that she was irresponsible for going away and leaving Emily in the store without telling her. Jen says I just want to treat Emily like a baby and that she is old enough to be able to be on her own in a store. I asked Jen why she did not answer her phone and she says she accidentally put it on do not disturb. Jen is angry that I called her irresponsible and says that what she did is nowhere close to being an irresponsible parent.

I know I can be overprotective of my kids but we do live in a high crime area and it makes me very angry that Emily was left feeling scared.

1akmu7i,AITA for eating the food my FIL served me and “ruining” my boyfriend and I’s holiday.,"  
Background info: I (M 41) am a white American, and my boyfriend (M 38) is Moroccan and half black. His parents took a dislike to me the moment we met. We’ve been together for two years, and he lives in America. The incident in question took place a few days ago. This is only my second time meeting his parents. His mother has been relatively quiet, but it’s obvious she feels the same as his father, who is on an all out warpath.   
  
They think that I’m a typical, useless, American party boy and not good enough for their son, who is an all around goodie-two-shoes. They are wealthy government employees who think that they’re contributing a lot to the world. Unlike me. Now, it is important to note that I am also wealthy, self made, and high ranking in my career. So I am not attempting to get on any gravy train. My boyfriend and I are staying at their home in Morocco.   
  
The four of us sat down for dinner, cooked by their private chef. Everybody got a bowl of some moroccan food, that smelled really good. I noticed that mine looked paler than the others and didn’t have as much of a smell. I didn’t comment at first, but then his father outright said, as if he was doing me a favor, that he told the chef to put a portion for me aside before she added ANY of the seasoning, because he thought that “my palate wouldn’t handle the spice well”. 

I have no issues with spicy food. I could tell that my boyfriend was already uncomfortable, and he told his father that I could eat what they’re eating. I managed to keep my cool, despite being really pissed off and told him in no uncertain terms that I could handle spicy food. Next thing, he took my food and went back to the kitchen. When he returned, my food was a shade darker than everyone else’s.   
  
I realized after the first bite that it wasn’t just spicy. It was inedible. My boyfriend noticed my reaction and told his father off before telling me to stop eating it. But I didn’t. I ate the damn food. And I have never in my life eaten anything like it. There must have been an entire bottle of hell in it. The pain. But I persevered, much to my boyfriends protests. His father simply watched. I was sweating buckets, felt sick, almost had an asthma attack (Another reason that my boyfriend was angry with me, because I put myself at risk) but I ate the whole bowl. Then I left the table victorious, but dying a death.   
  
Fast forward, I’ve been in bed for three days, still feel messed up, may not survive. My boyfriend says I should have been the bigger person and that there were no winners, that eating the whole bowl was as childish as his father was for serving it, and harmed only me. He’s been taking care of me, but he’s also blaming me.   
  
I don’t think I was the asshole, even if the last three days of our vacation have gone down the drain.   
  
TLDR: My boyfriends father served me inedible food to be petty, so I ate it to be petty and derailed me and my boyfriends vacation plans. And I wouldn’t change a thing.

I told him I spent the entire day doing the list that he sent me so I haven't cooked yet. He got annoyed and said that since I was just home all day, I should have been able to do a simple task such as cooking. I said we can just order takeout or something but he just got upset and went to his mom's for dinner. I don't know what I did wrong. I didn't call into work to be a housewife.

1az7ufr,AITA for telling my wife it’s weird that she and her mother share location 100% of the time on their phones?,"This just came up casually in conversation with my(37f) mother in law (68f). 
In reference to meeting her at the waterfront near our home, I was asking her to narrow it down a little when she said my wife (40f) could look for her location to make it easier. 

Assuming she was mistaken, I said she would have to share location for that to work and she informed me that she and my wife have that set up 100% of the time. I laughed and said that’s so unhealthy. 

Got off the phone and asked my wife to confirm and she said yes, I asked “Does that mean the opposite is also true? Are you sharing  your location with her 100% of the time?” 
She said yes, 

I was being snarky cos I thought she would agree with me. I said something like “come on, you must think that’s weird. Not even when you say it out loud?” 

Anyway, she’s furious with me, says I’m being mean, she’s crying and left the house furious with me. 

Am I the asshole here? I feel terrible about having blundered in and upset her , and will definitely apologise for the insensitivity as soon as we talk. 

But please someone tell me - is the maps thing normal and I’m the crazy one? 


UPDATE:

Wow, that was an absolute deluge of responses. Truly wasn’t expecting it to have that much engagement. Posting to hopefully wrap things here because I really need to stop reading this for a while. Just going to address a couple of things quickly:

1. Thanks so much to the people that came here sincerely to give me a different perspective on the location sharing thing. My takeaway from lots of people giving their input is that the 24/7 sharing is a much more passive activity whereas I think my experience of using things like dropping a pin or sharing an Uber ride, I think my perception of it is like more of an active thing. 

I get there is a range of perspectives and comfort levels on this and I clearly need to make a bit more space for that. 

2. I’M A WOMAN! 😂😂 Despite me including it in the OP , lots of people did miss the fact that my wife and I are in a queer relationship. Really no offence taken, it’s an easy mistake to make when reading through these quickly. Wanted to highlight it so that hopefully anyone who visits this subsequently doesn’t get into a whole “I don’t get it because I’m a man” conversation. 

3. I behaved in a shitty way to my wife. I thought I was clear on the fact that I knew I was the asshole for my response/attitude/how I said it but I obviously didn’t do a great job of that. My focus was more on the location thing and I definitely saw that my take was definitely in the minority about location sharing. 

4. Lots of people asked follow up questions about my wife and mother in law and people’s health, back stories with lots of further questions about their relationship, my relationship with parents etc. 
I’ve responded to questions about my own relationship with my mum a few places in the thread but I really get the ick at the prospect of adding more personal info about them. 

5. Everyone saying: 
what if something happens? What if she gets in a car accident? What if *all the worst possible things? I’d respectfully ask all of you to stop it. I’ve gotten the point  you’re making but please stop making me visualise the worst possible things happening to the best person I know. 

6. Last but not least, I had already apologised on the phone when I posted this. When my wife came home I apologised again , in person, and she was gracious enough to accept my apology. A little later I told her about this post and told her the internet has decided that I suck and she’s right so that gave us something else to giggle about it. 

Thanks everyone xx",mayorbette,1356,2055,0.7699999809265137,0.2798113189729159,1708814853,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1az7ufr/aita_for_telling_my_wife_its_weird_that_she_and/,2024,2

Yesterday, my mom had me take our cat to the vet for booster vaccination. It’s good time management, with her giving me the credit card and helping me get our cat into the carrier before she went to buy groceries.

I ran into my dad at the vet. First time I saw him in four years. He was there because he left his dog in the car for an hour and the pup got heatstroke. Fortunately he got to the vet in time.

Afterwards he asked if I’d get my cat home and then go have lunch with him, saying he regretted not being there all those years, but I said no.

1arszon,AITA for saying my stepmom can't take back how she treated me?,"I (24F) have always had a rocky relationship with my stepmom ""Cindy"" (51F). She came into my life when I was 13, and pretty much as soon as she and my dad were married, she became very pushy about taking up a parental role. She came to all my events and stuff, which I tried to appreciate, but she was also very ""it's my house too and I get to make rules"" after moving in with dad. She was the ""bad cop"" I guess; she was the one who thought I didn't have enough chores, that my grades weren't good enough, that I needed screen time limits, etc, and that lead to a lot of arguments.   
   
I hit the last straw at 17. The lawn needed cutting before Sunday; my dad said he'd do it Saturday afternoon, so I made plans to go hang out with friends for the day. While I was out, Cindy messaged me saying I shouldn't have let dad do the lawn because he'd had a tiring week, and that I would be doing it; her usual MO basically. I said no and stayed out with my friends. when I got home, she was furious and tried to ground me and it turned into this big stupid argument where I pulled the you're not my mom card. Dad ended up stepping in; I wasn't grounded, but also asked me to try and get along with her.   
   
It didn't matter, because she decided she was done. She just kinda stopped acknowledging me; we basically became roommates who hated each other. I wasn't even allowed to eat food she bought (not special stuff; like, when the bread ran out and she was the one to replace it). It was all just really tense, and I ended up spending a lot more time at my mom's apartment until I went to college.    
   
I've never formally blocked her or gone NC but we just haven't spoken since; she never came anytime I met up with Dad etc. Until me and my fiance announced our engagement. The wedding is over a year away, but Cindy sent me a long text, congratulating me and asking for all the details so she could help plan. She was asking about coming to dress fittings and if we wanted an engagement party and if she could make a speech at the wedding, basically asking about all the mother-of-the-bride stuff and pretending the last 11 years didn't happen. I didn't reply, until Dad reached out asking why I hadn't.   
   
I was honest with him; I'm weirded out by this. I'm happy for Cindy to come as his plus one, but she's not getting any role at the wedding (we're actually not even doing a head table, just because I don't want to share a table with her or separate her from Dad) because she's not my mom and the last time I saw her she was insistent about that. It's turned into a whole thing; he says she's really hurt and that he's rethinking coming to the wedding(?!) because she doesn't want to go, I say she can't take back what happened, and at the very least she should have apologised before reaching out like this.   
    
Mom and my partner are supportive of me, but I've had messages from several people on dad's side saying I'm an AH for 'punishing' Cindy and it's getting to me, so, AITA?",Character_Address53,4858,534,0.9700000286102295,0.24443194669588955,1708037979,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1arszon/aita_for_saying_my_stepmom_cant_take_back_how_she/,2024,2
1aolnna,AITA for deciding my baby’s name even though my husband hadn’t agreed on it?,"I, 32F, and my husband Chris, 33M, had our daughter about 2 months ago. We have similar tastes in names and we agreed upon Lara for a girl pretty early on. We found out a year ago that my sister Andrea, 35f, had been diagnosed with cancer. By the time I got pregnant she was already very sick. At 24 weeks pregnant, she passed away. We had not decided on a middle name at the time, but my husband wanted to give Lara his mother’s name, Jane, and he was set on it. After Andrea passed I wanted Lara’s middle name to be Andrea. He said he hated the name Andrea and it would make more sense to name her after her grandma than an aunt. This made me upset and I told him that his mother was alive and well, and I wanted to remember my sister. I brought up giving her two middle names and he didn’t want to do that either.

When she was born we still hadn’t agreed on one. Towards the end of the birthing process, the visuals were a bit too much for Chris and he passed out. So when the nurse asked what the name was, I said Lara Andrea. Once he was conscious again I told him that I put down Lara Andrea. He mumbled “fine”. I thought he was okay with Lara Andrea now, but now I realize he was trying to be nice because I just gave birth.

Last month he brought up changing the name to Lara Jane. I said no because we had already named her, and I brought up doing two middle names again. He got mad at me and we’ve been arguing about this practically every day. He keeps calling her Lara Jane. He STILL doesn’t want to do double middle name. I feel our family and friends are biased because they either knew Andrea or know Jane. I feel like maybe I should’ve done a double middle name or put down Jane, and I’m wondering if I should change it.

I feel like I might be in the wrong here for ignoring his opinion and taking advantage of the fact he was unconscious to choose the name I wanted. So AITA?

  
edit: Thank you for all the replies and suggestions. Most of them were either YTA or ESH, which I both understand. I apologized to Chris. The most liked name combo on r/namenerds was Andrea Jane.

1av2qx9,AITA For not caring that my daughter is going through a difficult time with a friend and returning her birthday gift after the way she treated her cousin?,"What Happened: My daughter Brooke’s birthday was on Friday, so we had a celebration at home. Everything was going well until it was time for singing. Brooke blew out the candles and her cousin Aria blew on the cake too.

My SIL and BIL said oops and apologized. Aria obviously didn’t understand. It was just an accident. But then Brooke turned it into a scene. She snapped at Aria, raising her voice and calling Aria a “F\*\*\*ing brat.”

I immediately got firm and told Brooke to apologize. Brooke tried to argue that Aria ruined her birthday candles. I told Brooke that I don’t care who you are or what day it is. It is **never** okay to treat a 3-year-old that way as a 20-year-old adult. Brooke refused to apologize and stormed off.

After everyone had left, I informed Brooke that because she refused to apologize for the way she acted towards her cousin, I was returning her purse which was the main gift I had bought her. She also got a Stanley Cup but I let her to keep it since it’s something practical for school.

Brooke tried arguing that she’s too old for me to be confiscating her things and returning the purse was going too far. But I just told Brooke that I bought the purse with my own money and was free to do what I pleased with it. And if she wanted to act like a child then she’s going to get treated like one.

Why I’m Writing: My wife Kimberly said she is not going to re-buy the purse for Brooke and she agreed Brooke was out-of-line for how she treated Aria during the birthday celebration. But Kim said that I should have more understanding for Brooke because of what’s going on with Jessy.

Jessy has been Brooke’s best friend since they were in 4th grade. The problem is that Jessy recently got engaged and her fiance is not a good guy. Brooke and Jessy’s family staged an intervention to talk to Jessy, but Jessy is insistent on the marriage and has been talking to Brooke less and less.

Of course, I understand that it is a heartbreaking situation and am sorry Brooke has to experience that with her friend. But what is happening with Jessy has nothing to do with the way Brooke treated Aria.

If Brooke had snapped at Aria but immediately apologized after, then I could see how returning her purse could be seen as unfair. But I think Kimberly is being too lenient with our daughter, and Brooke needs to understand that going through a difficult situation is not an excuse to behave poorly towards others. AITA?

Edited to answer a common question: My SIL was holding Aria and keeping an eye on her during the birthday celebration. My BIL was explaining to Aria why she can't blow on the candles on someone else's birthday. We were in the middle of correcting Aria when Brooke snapped at her.",BirthdayAHThrowaway,2471,1185,0.8999999761581421,0.22572611896538816,1708386386,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1av2qx9/aita_for_not_caring_that_my_daughter_is_going/,2024,2
1b1q76f,AITA because I didn't let my son stay home today?,"My son (16M) approached me yesterday after school and told me that he didn't want to go to school the next day. I asked him why and he told me that he just didn't feel like going and he was tired of waking up early in the morning. I told him that that wasn't a good enough reason for him to stay home and that if he feels tired when waking up in the morning then he should try and go to get in bed earlier.

He got upset with me when I told him that and told me that he needs to stay home for the sake of his mental health. He then told me that making him go to school would only worsen it. I asked him why he thought that and he told me that the kids and teachers at his school irritates him. This made me concerned so I asked him if anyone was bullying him or if he was having problems with some of his teachers and he just told me that he wasn't and he just finds them annoying. I asked him if that was the only reason and he told me that it was.

I understood where my son was coming from and I tried to show my understanding. I told him how I sometimes find my co workers annoying too, but that doesn't mean I get to skip work just because of it. I told him that if he is serious about school being detrimental to his mental health then I told him that I'll try and find him a therapist to help him manage it. He then got even more mad at me and told me that he doesn't need a therapist and that he only needs time away from school. He told me that I don't understand how stressful school can be and that's why he needs time away. I told him that I do understand, and a therapist could be beneficial in helping him deal with stress.

He started arguing with me about not wanting to go again and I just got frustrated. I told him that he has an upcoming doctor's appointment this Wednesday so there's no need for him to miss both Tuesday and Wednesday. I told him that I don't want him to miss days of school unless they are absolutely necessary. 

He took this as me telling him that his mental health wasn't important and then he started telling me that I must not love him if I send him to school. He then told me that if I try and force him to see a therapist I'll have something else to worry about?? I asked him to clarify what he meant by that but he didn't specify. He just told me not to worry about it and to leave him alone. 

Cut to this morning, he was very hostile with me from the moment he woke up and was practically ignoring me whenever I tried to speak to him. Then when I dropped him off at school he told me  that he finds it weird that I hate him so much and don't want him to succeed in life?? Then before I could say anything he got out of the car quickly. When I picked him up from school today, I tried to talk about what happened and what he said but he just ignored me and is still not speaking to me?

1aq7hxr,AITA for telling my sober friend it's not my job to have the exact non-alcoholic drink she wants at the parties I throw?,"I'm in college right now. My best friend Joshua (made up for anonymity purposes) is dating one of my other friends Ashley (also made up), and she barely ever drinks. Which, good for her, I respect people that are sober. 

I have parties at my place around once a month and like to make a batched alcoholic punch of some kind, but I get Coke or fruit punch or something non alcoholic as well, cause I don't want to pressure people to drink. 

At the last party I threw, despite having Coke Zero and Dr Pepper, Ashley was like ""Do you have sparkling water?"" I said ""No."" I don't really like sparkling water, so I'd never buy it for myself. She looked upset but she said regular water was fine. 

She sends me this long text message the next day, basically saying ""I really wish you would have sparkling water for me when you throw stuff and consider me. I don't like really sugary stuff like soda and don't want to drink, but it's boring having just water to drink. Just because I don't drink doesn't mean I don't deserve a fun drink too."" 

I basically told her ""It's not my job to buy something I don't ever drink with MY money just for YOU to have. I provide non-alcoholic options because I am considerate of you and the other people that don't drink and if you don't want to drink them then go to your store and buy some yourself. I advertise it as BYOB, so that can apply to you. Or at least have Joshua buy it for you, I'm not your servant.""

Joshua's not mad at me but he told me I should talk to Ashley and apologize. I just don't get why I should apologize. That would imply I did something wrong. Sparkling water doesn't cost a lot so it's not a money thing, but it's the principle of it. Wanting me to buy something *else* for each party when I provide 1-2 NA options, *and* you're capable of buying it and bringing it yourself, and you don't even offer to buy me something or do something for me in return. Plus why am I being held to a higher standard than her literal boyfriend?

When I got engaged, I had my wedding date already picked for early summer 2024 and immediately told my family the date. My sister is a photographer and so I warned her with plenty of notice to not book for that date. I tried talking to her about my wedding planning but she asked me not to talk to her about it because she just wanted to focus on hers only. Fine, no big deal but doesn’t mean I’m not going to continue to plan mine. This past October (2023) she asked me to remind her of the date. When I told her, she said that she booked a wedding back in January for that date and asked me to move it. I have said no because this date was properly planned out and picked for me and my fiance. I’m now being told it’s my fault and clearly she’s not that important to me because I’m refusing to move my wedding date. I see it the other way around. Why wouldn’t she cancel her client in order to prioritize me. I’m the oldest child of 4. I never ask for anything, this is the 1 thing I am holding fast on. I am heart broken that she won’t be there, but also extremely hurt that she is putting all the blame on me rather than accepting she also has control over her decisions. Am I wrong? AITA?

Update: 
Thank you everyone for your support. I am not okay in all this and never stand strong on anything and 9/10 usually cave in to give family what they want vs my own needs. But, that’s boundaries and that’s what I’m learning for myself. To answer some questions. When I first got engaged she told me she wanted to photograph my wedding. Then we talked about it and decided it wasn’t the best idea because she wouldn’t be able to be present at the wedding and would just be behind a camera the whole time. 
I’m now being told that my mom and other sister agree with her and that I didn’t tell her until this past October, yet I have a family group text proving otherwise.  
I’m staying strong. I’m not moving my date. But like I said, I’m just heartbroken that this is how it is turning out. ",Puzzled-Extent-8487,4871,323,0.9700000286102295,0.22150378784340152,1708210522,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ateunj/aita_i_refuse_to_move_my_wedding_date/,2024,2
1akosne,AITA because a teenager went into my “office”,"I 22F and my boyfriend 36M have a pretty active sex life, we try to keep it behind closed doors so in our small 2 bedroom apartment we have the second room hold anything that may be inappropriate for family or friends to stumble across. 
The only way to get in is with a key and that key is in the safe in our bedroom.

My 13M nephew and his mum decided to visit us yesterday and in teenage boy fashion he went snooping, he somehow managed to unlock the door with a pocket knife he had and was not pleased with what he saw.

My sister and parents are livid with what he saw and think it will scar him for life, while I believe he is at fault for snooping.
They won’t let up about it and think we shouldn’t have that sorta stuff so close to where people sit and hang out.

They have also hated my boyfriend from the beginning so this is adding more fuel to the fire.

1ar1ay7,AITA for not carrying on another family's tradition?,"In our house, we have two birthdays coming up. My wife's son Marcel (turning 16) and her daughter Marceline (turning 13). Asking them what they want for their birthday, they both said that just the ""normal gift"" was great. Seeing that I was confused, my wife helpfully reminded me of the ""traditional luggage gift"", and then I realized. 

There was a family tradition of giving kids a luggage set for their 16th birthday, yes, but that was my ex-wife's family, not mine. I was never even involved. It was always a thing for them. A few decades ago, one of my ex's sisters got a job at a high-end luggage company, and took over for the next gen of the family (my daughter and her cousins) because she could get it for really cheap with her discount. My daughter is the youngest of the kids on that side, and around the time she was turning 13, between the aunt knowing she would be retiring soon and some personal drama, they decided to give my daughter her set for her 13th birthday so she wouldn't be left out. 

I've always thought that tradition was stupid and a stupid amount of money to spend. Even $1,000 is way too much to spend on luggage for anyone, especially a kid. I wouldn't spend that much on myself. I tried to tell them all of this. My wife thinks that by letting my daughter participate (by accepting the gift), I've made it my family tradition as well, and now I'm just singling her kids out. I'm not. 

Not caring about her accepting a gift from her own aunts doesn't mean I don't still think it's stupid. There's a LOT of difference between ""you can't have this because it's not worth buying"" and ""you can't have this because I think it's inappropriate or dangerous"". 

Also, it would be even more expensive for us to buy it for them than even the aunt spent on my daughter. My daughter's set cost me $0, and her aunt $1,000 as she had a discount. Buying the other kids' sets would cost me $2,000 each, so $4,000. 

Now everyone is upset at me because I'm apparently making it clear that I don't care about Marcel and Marceline as much as my daughter because I'm breaking tradition and telling them they don't ""deserve anything"" that my daughter had. Am I wrong for thinking this is ridiculous?",travelinman55,3422,655,0.949999988079071,0.20313466990306117,1707953787,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ar1ay7/aita_for_not_carrying_on_another_familys_tradition/,2024,2
1az7lll,AITA for telling my mom that I won’t postpone my wedding if she pays for my nose job (that I blame her for),"My fiancé (34M) and I (31F) got engaged in Nov 2023. We were planning a Dec 2024 wedding, but we’ve learned that I need a nose job for medical & aesthetic reasons, so we’ve postponed the wedding until after due to finances. My mom (65F) is mad about the whole thing & how it will be perceived by relatives.

*BACKSTORY*

When I was 9, I fell off my bike & broke my nose.


Sadly, my mom didn’t believe that it was broken. She said I was “over-exaggerating” the pain. She refused to take me to the doctor. It hurt so much, I cried daily for weeks.


*Note: she was a SAHM & we live in Canada, so taking me to a doctor wouldn’t have cost money or time off work.*


Since then, I’ve had issues with breathing and awful sinus pain- occasionally to the point of vomiting. Flying is torture. Random weather changes are torture. I spend 16-23 days a year in bed immobilized by pain/pressure in my left sinuses. 


Also, my nose never looked the same after. In middle school, kids said l look like Gollum and I’m still a little self conscious about it. 


In 2021, I decided that I can’t live like this anymore and started working with my doctor to figure out the root cause of my sinus issues.

The Canadian healthcare system moves slowly. 

A couple weeks ago, I got MRI results back and they established that:
(1) My nose was broken in childhood
(2) It didn’t heal properly because it had no medical intervention 
(3) I need surgery for my nose/sinuses to work, so I can live/breathe like a normal person.


Since they’re doing surgery on my nose anyway, I decided I want my nose’s aesthetic fixed at the same time. They will make my nose look like it would’ve naturally.


Canadian healthcare will pay for the “medical” part of surgery. It won’t pay for the cosmetic part. Nose jobs are expensive. 


We decided to postpone the wedding so we can pay for my nj ASAP instead. I can’t wait to breathe properly, and to have a “normal” nose. 


Last week, I told my mom about the postponement and she flipped. She says relatives are planning their whole year around my wedding, and this is a really unfair to do this to them over “vanity”. 


I told her that I can’t afford a nj and a wedding in the same year. & that it was unfair to me that she refused to take me to a doctor back in the day. & that if she really wants the wedding this year, she could pay for my nj so I don’t have to. 

We haven’t spoken since.

Tbh, since it was confirmed by a doctor that I *did* break my nose as a kid, I’ve had simmering anger/hurt towards my mom. I’ve lived with awful pain for decades, and now need surgery for something that could’ve been avoided if she had just believed me & been a parent… but maybe telling her to pay for the nj was unfair/too petty. AITA?

**tl;dr - broke my nose in childhood. Mom refused to take me to doctor. improper healing caused pain & suffering into adulthood. now I’m paying for corrective cosmetic surgery instead of a wedding and Mom’s mad about it. maybe I’m too vain**",wynawtt,4092,344,0.9700000286102295,0.19414528600539643,1708814238,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1az7lll/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_i_wont_postpone_my/,2024,2

1awqdj7,AITA for Refusing to get my Pregnant Wife Coconut Yogurt for her Cravings and then Telling her she Needs to Manage her Expectations? ,"My (26M) wife (26F) and I are going to be having a baby soon, she is 4 months pregnant.

My wife has been having intense cravings and I am more than happy to bring her favourite food from work. Most of the times, I also cook for her when she wants something really specific.

My wife has her own cupboard and a section in the fridge that has JUST her snacks - I don’t take her stuff without asking her. Last night, I had coconut yogurt and some rolled oats with fruit for a quick dinner - and this yogurt was kept in the shared space. I ate the last pack not knowing my wife has been having cravings for it, so it was unusual what happened today. 

I work a physically demanding job and today was a pretty exhausting day. I was looking forward to just relaxing at home and watching a movie. An hour into relaxing at home my wife came into the kitchen area looking for coconut yogurt, I told her I ate the last pack and she got a little upset because she saw this choco-based recipe on tiktok and coconut yogurt was a key ingredient in this meal. She said that since I ate the last pack, I should go outside right now and get it for her. Now, the nearest grocery store is like 30 minutes away and I really didn’t want to go outside. 

I told her as much and said had she asked me to bring it while coming home from work I would’ve gone to buy it for her. She started pestering me and putting pressure on me and I got irritated with her. She said that she’s pregnant and has intense cravings and as a good partner should make sure she’s feeling happy and comfortable. And that food is the only thing that brings her joy. Said that I can’t understand what she’s going through. 

I told her that she’s being really unfair and making me out to be a bad husband and that she needs to manage her expectations. I said that this is just a craving, it’ll pass in some time. I’ll get it tomorrow for her but just not now. 

She has been showing an attitude to me and it’s really making me want to say that she should be grateful that I do all these things for her but I won’t because I don’t want make her more pouty.

1axjlkz,AITA for telling the father of my child that I won’t share custody until I know he knows how to be a father?,"I’m gonna start this off by saying he doesn’t want to go to court to figure this out, but we will if absolutely necessary. 

So I just gave birth to a baby girl a few weeks ago. My ex and I broke up while pregnant (we argued way too much and both agreed that kind of environment is not good for a baby, so please don’t come at me for being a single mom). We have been working together as a team to be the best parents we can be, regardless of the split. He wants shared custody, but I’m very hesitant because he’s admitted that he doesn’t know the first thing about babies. 

I’ve tried showing him how to change her diaper but it grosses him out. He says he can just have his mom do it because he still lives with her. I told him that as much as I love and respect his mom, it is not her responsibility and she is not going to be the one with custody. I’d trust her with both mine and my child’s life, but he is the father and he needs to know how to change her diaper. 

Another issue is he works a lot and a lot of the time, he goes away on business trips. I asked him how that would work if he goes away on one of his custody weeks, and again, he said he’d have his mom take care of her. It’s important to note that his mom is a hard working woman and works about 60-80 hours a week. 

I think the biggest thing that worries me is that he lives two hours away and I can’t imagine the anxiety it would bring to have my infant that far away from me. 

He’s been calling me selfish, saying that I’m keeping his child from him, which I understand, but that’s not true. I have a spare room in my house that I told him he can stay in whenever he wants, so he can stay for the night or literally however long he’d like, or I can come to his place (his mom has a spare room and said that I can come stay if I’d like). This arrangement would work very well because our daughter is exclusively breastfed (we’ve tried breastmilk in a bottle but she won’t latch). 

Also, he has not bought a single thing for her (despite having more than enough money). All the baby stuff at his house was bought by his mom. I am so grateful for her love and support, but again, he is the father and he has not shown any sort of responsibility. 

He’s pissed at me for “implying he’s not a good dad” but all I’ve been saying is I would like to be sure that the person taking care of her knows what they’re doing. I’ve been trying to show him how but he gets really defensive and doesn’t want to learn. I told him we can just go to court to figure it out (neither of us want a nasty court battle but it we can do it amicably) but he doesn’t want to so they can’t “order him to pay child support,” which pisses me off because regardless of whether or not you’re ordered to pay child support, you should want to do everything possible to support your child.

1aj0blb,AITA for refusing to babysit for my aunt and uncle until I'm paid for the last time?,"Borrowing a friends account (Thanks btw)

I (17/F) have been voluteering at my previous elementary school. I'm not sure if its relevant, but my cousins ( Ella 6/F & Liam 8/M) go to this school as well. 

I'm known as the ""fun one"" at school (kids words, not mine). Because of this, a lot of the parents of the younger kids ask me to babysit. I love kids, so its not hard for me. The parents are usually out for a few hours, and I only ask for about $20 per day. I've had no problem with this since.

about a month ago, my Aunt and uncle went off on a vacation for a week, and asked me to babysit. I agreed of course. I stayed over each night, to their request. My cousins are not hard kids to deal with, they're actually very sweet and well behaved for their age. Because of this, and that they're family, I only charged $10/day. So, about $70 since they got home later in the night. 

I waited a day or two after they got before asking about the payment, and they outright refused. Saying that because they're family, I should do it for free. They also said that since I said they werent hard kids, I didn't have to do much.

After a little back and forth, I decided to cut my loses and didn't babysit for them again. Now, they're planning to go on a bit of a road trip together, and they asked me to babysit again. I said if they paid me for the last time I babysat then I'd be more than happy. They kept complaining and whining, saying I'm the only person they have (I'm not tho, they have multiple other people available).

 They're now complaining to my parents, trying to get them to make me babysit, but I'm still refusing until they pay me for the last time. My parents are asking me to just do it to keep the peace.

1asmgxn,AITA for refusing to pay for private school for my step daughter,"A bit of backstory regarding this. I (36m) have been with my wife (37f) for 8 years. Of the two children there is my stepdaughter (13) and our daughter (6). We have been discussing sending our daughter to private school (PS) for the last few weeks and it has now boiled over into a full blown argument. She believes that if we send our daughter to PS that I should send my stepdaughter to PS as well as it would be “neglecting” her otherwise. My wife has majority custody of my stepdaughter and does not recieve child support for her as her ex husband made very poor life choices which I understand. My wife also has not worked for the entirety of our relationship. I have covered all of my stepdaughters expenses from day 1. After seeing how poorly the public school system has done for my stepdaughter I brought up and have been insistent on sending our daughter to private school. In my mind I want to give our daughter the best possible chance in terms of education which from what I’ve seen does not bode well in public school. Although I love and treat my stepdaughter as my own I do not feel as though I should be responsible for her education as I have never been given a say in regards to it from the beginning. I do have the financial means to send both however, it will be pushing the limits of what I can feasibly do in terms of vacations, birthdays, holidays etc. for our family. My wife disagrees and says that if I can do it for our daughter then I must do it for my stepdaughter regardless of if we have to give up vacations and cut back.

1b0va9w,AITA For excluding my wife’s friend from trip solely because we think she is annoying?,"Maybe not as dramatic as other situations here but here goes, My(M31) wife (F30) has a friend, we’ll call her Dana (F34), they have been friends for a little more than 10 years and it’s important to note that the only friend Dana has is my wife (for the sake of the post I’ll call her Laura).

  
Dana has always had difficulties making and keeping friends, this is because she’s a classical “one upper” if you tell her about a vacation you had and enjoy, she’ll tell you it’s nothing compared to her last vacation. You’re going through a bad time? We’ll it’s nothing compared to what’s she’s going through and stuff like that.

  
Since her only friend is Laura, I got to hang out with her a lot, I don’t like her and don’t consider her a friend but I am civil to her.

  
Laura has tried to integrate Dana to another group of friends of ours for a few years now but it not going well. The breaking point was one night when we were drinking and a friend opened up about losing a beloved pet and Dana responded by saying it was nothing compared to when she lost a blouse her mother had given her last year. After that some people wouldn’t hang out if she was coming and so.

  
Now to the issue, we’re planning a week long camping trip along with 2 more friends and their spouses, of these friends, only one of them has met Dana. 

  
Laura thinks this might be a good chance for Dana to meet new people, so she suggested we invite her I was obviously against it, I get tired just imagining a week with her and told her so, she knows I’m not a fan of hers but is hoping  I will help her improve her social skill but I don’t think our vacation should be her opportunity, we fought a little and didn’t solve anything.

  
Here is why I think I could be an asshole. I continue planning the trip and every time Laura told me to invite Dana I would just tell her I’ll do it once all is set up (I had no intention in doing so), anyway the trip is a few weeks away and last Saturday the cat was out of the bag about me not wanting Dana to come. 

  
Laura argues that “being annoying” is no reason to exclude her and if she needs to improve her social skills we should be helping her, I obviously disagree but I have never seen Laura this angry so I’m doubting myself. So Am I the Asshole?

I have been no contact with my parents for years, but recently they got diagnosed with dementia, and my siblings agreed that someone should stop by at least two times a day. 

A few days ago I got guilt tripped by my brother, to ""pull my weight"" and check in on them that afternoon. While visiting they got all serious and said there was something important they wanted to discuss with me before I left. They sat me down and asked me to just hear them out and consider what they had to say. Not knowing what was coming I agreed.

They stated that they believed, that my wife, Lesli, was going to cheat on me, now that I am legally obligated to be take care of Gwen. They went on to explain that she has been isolating me from my real family to prevent me from hearing the truth. They urged me to just call a lawyer they know and they pulled out a business card and kept trying to force me to take.

I kept asking them to just stop, but they kept speaking over me, telling me they just want to help, so I kept getting louder and louder till I was shouting.

Instead I yelled that I don't visit because they are terrible people who made my childhood miserable. Then I told them they are not family, and I don't care if they rot.

Me and my girlfriend just got engaged after almost 9 years of dating and are planning on having our wedding spring of next year. With this we have begun planning the wedding and one of the topics that came up was if we want kids at our wedding. We are both the oldest kids/cousins in our family and with this have had multiple little kids at every major event in our lives. We decided that we do not want young kids (under 10)  to attend the reception as we want to have a more adult style of reception. 

When mentioning this to my mother she was not happy with the decision we made as some people will have to leave early because of the no kids rule. There are 3 families that are invited that have kids under 10 with a total of 7 kids under 10 years old. Me and my fiancé were expecting at least one of the parents if not both from each family to leave early to take care of their kids and were completely ok with this as they have other responsibilities to tend to. 

Now my mother is saying that her and my step dad will be leaving early so that they can throw a separate celebration at their house so that the people that are forced to leave since they have kids have somewhere to go and can still have a good time. With this she is telling most of the guest from her side of the family  (about 50 of the 125 invited) that they should come to her party instead of the reception. 

After hearing this from her we got into a heated argument, with her saying she is doing what she feels is right and doesn't need my permission to throw a celebration. it ended with me saying ""You are choosing to throw a ""celebration"" at the same time as our reception against our wishes, which you don't need our permission for, you are right about that. but if you are going to leave early because you feel it is the ""right thing todo"" you can just not worry about coming to the wedding in the first place. Because i certainly feel the right thing todo would be to support your kids wishes on his wedding day instead of leaving early to go party somewhere else."" 

This is very difficult for me to accept as I have always imagined my parents being there on my wedding day but at the same time we do not want her there if she is just going to leave early to go party somewhere else and try to take half of our guests with her.

1b2lnwd,AITA for screaming at my sons gf mom to get out of my house?,"My husband and I come from a small religious town. Which we are strongly religious we don’t follow the same strict rules as everyone else were very open minded. Our oldest son(18Jacob) girlfriend moved in with us on her 18th birthday, due to finding out she was pregnant and her parents were extremely controlling. We were shamed by everyone in our town for the pregnancy itself, but we never paid a mind to it. Three weeks ago, Jacob girlfriend had her baby, she kept it a secret from her mother, but we’re assuming someone at the hospital opened their mouths.

 Two nights ago we had a banging at my door, and it was her mother demanding to come in and see “this secret baby.” My sons girlfriend said I could let her in if she promised to calm down, in which I relayed the message and obliged. Her mother was calm at first, until she began talking about how she’d pray for her daughters soul not to be damned, and began loudly praying in my livingroom. I told her she needed to stop, and she began to calm down then tried telling my sons girlfriend that they could fix this, that the baby is still young enough to be deeply wanted by an adopting family.  My sons girlfriend started crying and I told her it was time to leave. 

She started saying I was sugar coating things for these kids and that they have no clue how to raise a baby and they are too young. She called my son rude names and basically said he’d be working at the county for the rest of his life and I told her she needed to get out of my house right now, very loudly in which she obliged.  Later on I got a text on Facebook from her saying I was a horrible role model and shouldn’t keep her from her daughter and that everyone would know what goes on behind my door. I  went grocery shopping yesterday and our cashier who I know wouldn’t talk to me, and today I was actually asked to leave my church that I’ve been going to for the past 10 years by a deacon. I’m truly so upset by this, AITA",Dear-Project2063,1964,370,0.949999988079071,0.11592786661028971,1709164379,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1b2lnwd/aita_for_screaming_at_my_sons_gf_mom_to_get_out/,2024,2
1avwl7y,AITAH for not getting a nose piercing when my husband really wants me to?,"My husband and I have very similar taste in all aspects but one - body modification. He’s a tattoo toting, piercing loving guy. I like to appreciate the art on others. I don’t personally have a problem with body modification - I just don’t want to modify mine. 

I have a friend who is beautiful beyond reason, and she really pulls off piercings so well. She’s made me consider getting (gasp) second lobe piercings. 

I asked my husband what he thought about me getting second love piercings, and somehow the conversation turned to getting a tattoo. I told him flat out “No.” We’d been through this ten years ago when we were dating. He can get as many tattoos as he wants, but I don’t want any.

So then he asks, “What about a nose piercing?” He said it in a cheeky kind of way, so I rolled my eyes and said, “I’ll think about it.” And I did. For days. I didn’t mention it to my husband because I knew he wasn’t really being cheeky - he was being half serious. But I did consider the nose piercing. Honestly, I don’t want a piercing on my face. 

Well, today my husband sent me a picture of ear piercings and asked me which one I wanted. Then he says, “And a nose piercing?” I decided that I needed to come clean to him. I told him that I don’t want a piercing on my face. He then said that I’ve broken his heart and that I never do anything he likes. 

That was five hours ago. Now, he won’t return my calls or texts (we’re long distance for a few months while I’m working abroad). He responded to my fourth message by saying he’s busy, but I have my doubts. The big girl inside me says he’s trying to guilt me into getting this piercing, but another part wonders: am I being too precious about this piercing?

1agnz27,AITA for not telling my husband to go to his sister's wedding even though I'm not invited?,"My husband (m26) and I (f25) have three kids, our eldest is 7, then we have a 4 year old and a ten month old baby. My husband's sister (f30) is the one getting married. 

Our relationship with her isn't so great, she is always making unnecessary comments. I know that she dislikes me a lot, she didn't like me from the first time my (then boyfriend) introduced us together. Then when I got pregnant I was still in school and my boyfriend had just started college. He dropped out and we needed a lot of support from our families to settle down back then. So my SIL thinks that I f*cked up her brother's/ family's life because I didn't get an abortion at the time. She has always been rather hostile, we mostly only see her at family gatherings, she doesn't visit or anything and honestly that's better. She has caused problems before because she says that my husband was the ""golden child"" and she was the ""scapegoat"", and then when I got pregnant their parents basically adopted me and spoiled me because I was with my husband. 

So, she sent invitations for her wedding. She sent my husband his invitation which had his name and our three kids' names, not mine. My hubby asked her about this and she said that I'm not a pleasant person to be around, so I'm not invited. He told her that is extremely disrespectful since I'm his wife, they argued a bit through text and my husband told her to not count on him or the kids because they're not going. 

She blamed it on my hubby being immature. My in-laws tried to mediate between them, she replied to them saying that she's not surprised they're taking our side. They argued and my in-laws said that since she's having this attitude, they're not going either to the wedding. Immediately after she started blaming me. She said that this is all my fault because I could've just accepted that I am not invited and ""allow"" my husband and children to exist without me for a couple hours. She also called me stupid and uneducated, also spoiled, and said I have ""princess syndrome"".

I told this to my husband and his parents, they told some other family members and now apparently a lot of them cancelled their assistance as well. She keeps blaming it all in me. Yes, I didn't tell my husband to go, I admit that, so I think that's why I'm possibly an asshole because I could've prevented such a big drama and I didn't. Also I think that she's just an asshole in general, but in this case she might be for expecting my husband to be okay with her leaving me behind.",Tiny_Violinist9932,1938,338,0.9399999976158142,0.11138453955505262,1706827443,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1agnz27/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_to_go_to_his/,2024,2

1aleaaj,AITA for embarrassing my sister in public by accusing her boyfriend of stealing my tip money?,"We live in different states and she just started dating this guy although he’s been a part of her friend group since college. This was also the first time I met her boyfriend.

This past weekend I was in a city near hers and called to see if she wanted to meet up. She had plans with her friends so she invited me to come along, which I did. We had a fun day with the group and eventually went to dinner. Nothing was out of the ordinary until the check came. Her boyfriend took the check, read aloud the amount, and split the bill and tip (which we rounded to $10 a person) amongst the table then he placed his credit card for the server to take away. Everyone handed him cash for their portion. I guess I gave off a look so my sister explained that he doesn’t like to go to the bank so whenever the group goes out, he pays with his card and the group gives him cash. I didn’t think anything further about it so I handed him my portion.

The next day I couldn’t find my prescription sunglasses in my hotel room or rental car and I knew I had it yesterday. I remembered the last time I took it off was when we got to the restaurant. On my way to lunch with my sister and some people from last night, I stopped by last night’s restaurant to ask if they found a pair of sunglasses and was greeted by the same server but this time she looked angry. 

The short of it was that I found out my sister’s boyfriend only tipped her $10 for our group of 12 people. I was taken aback because based on our split, she should have gotten $120 in tips. I asked to see the receipt and sure enough, it was $10. I apologized and gave her another $10. When I got to lunch, I immediately asked him to give me back $10. That started the questions from the group that descended into an argument until the restaurant asked us to leave. 

My sister is now mad at me for causing a scene and embarrassing her in front of her friends and the people in the restaurant.",InformalSignature436,2063,248,0.9599999785423279,0.10615750317797314,1707341513,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1aleaaj/aita_for_embarrassing_my_sister_in_public_by/,2024,2

1askspc,AITA for sending my daughter to live with her father?,"I divorced my ex when Lana (15f) was small. After a while I met my husband, who had a son (17m) from a previous marriage and we had a baby (2f) together.

His son accepted me just fine, we managed to create an amazing blended family, if not for the fact that Lana wasn’t a fan of the idea. She openly disrespects my husband, her step brother and her little sister and said multiple times that she doesn’t consider them family.

I said okay then, you may not love them or even like, but everyone would benefit from having some mutual respect. Neither me nor my husband forced Lana into the family. But she would always start unnecessary drama, screaming and yelling that she wants to live with her father. Her daddy dearest was definitely putting those ideas in her head.

Things escalated when me and my husband had to attend an important work event, we work at the same company, so we couldn’t just skip it, no one of us could. My step son had football practice that day, he’s in his senior year and he’s a very successful player so we hope he gets a scholarship and that’s why we’re strict about him attending practice. I asked Lana to babysit her little sister, she outright refused, making a huge scene. Please note that I don’t use her as an unpaid babysitter, in fact I don’t demand anything from her and was more than ready to add a little extra to her allowance.

Her throwing a scene was the final straw. I’ve been dealing with her tantrums and disrespect for three years now, ever since I married my husband. I had enough, and as she was at school, I got in contact with my ex, packed her bags and took them to his house. My ex was more than happy to take her in and he picked her up from school that day.

Here’s the kicker: my ex lives off the grid in a very rural area. They have to run a generator and my ex is stingy about the fuel. He has no wifi and connection at his house is barely strong enough to browse websites, so no TikTok or Instagram. Lana has to use the outhouse, and since the warm water is sparse, she’s not allowed long showers anymore. My ex is a very strict parent and Lana managed to get her iPhone taken away and replaced with a flip phone on her first day at his place (for the record, she said an f word in front of him and he’s the kind of parent who demands being called sir). And she actually has to do way more chores that are more complicated and time consuming because my ex has 24 hour shifts often.

Of course she wants to come back now. My husband says I should take her back in because she learned the lesson. My ex says he’d rather keep her as he got an unpaid housemaid now and her allowance is now his child support. I personally don’t want to take her back in. I’m content with the zero amount of drama we have at home now. Lana says I’m an asshole.",BreadfruitTop2876,638,585,0.8299999833106995,0.08925815126921932,1708120509,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1askspc/aita_for_sending_my_daughter_to_live_with_her/,2024,2
1atfyqh,"AITA for refusing to give a girl a ride because she had a ""therapy dog""?","I (M18) have a pretty decent relationship with this girl, Mira (F18), who lives in my residence. She's next door to my roommate and me, and we have many classes together. Mira and I also hang out in overlapping social groups and are part of some study groups together, so we know each other decently well.

While we get along most of the time, Mira can be a bit whiny and annoying. She complains about everything and seems to love to argue about every little thing with me. Its bizarre because some of my friends noticed that she seems to have some strange fixation with arguing with me.

After the December break, Mira came back to school with a small retriever puppy named Max, which she claimed as her therapy dog. Mira takes Max everywhere with her, and it's pretty clear to everyone that this dog ain’t trained at all. For the past month and a half, Max has done several annoying things which Mira just let happen.

For example, the first week she brought him, he ran in front of my dorm room and took a shit on my welcome mat. Another time, Mira let Max shake himself all over me in the elevator. He had come inside from playing in the snow, so he was filthy. I know it’s petty, but I’m still pissed about that since I had just brought those clothes out of the laundry that morning. Most recently, he ripped a bag of takeout I had (again in the elevator). Mira did reimburse me for that, but it was still annoying since I had to go back out and get food again. Max also starts yelping and barking randomly some days at 3 am, which is inconvenient. Mira says its because he has nightmares apparently.

Yesterday, Mira asked me if I could drop her off on my way home. The city her family lives in is on the way to my town, and she offered to split the gas money with me. She said this was because Max gets anxious on the bus since there are so many people.

I refused. I told Mira (as politely as I could) I couldn’t risk Max randomly taking a shit in my car. Mira got defensive about this and said he wouldn’t, and that she’d warn me to pull over if she thought he would. We argued; she said I was being heartless and didn’t care about Max and cared more about my car. I made a point not to deny that (even though she seemed to wait for me to) and this pissed her off even more.

I ended up driving home on my own.

In the past hour or so, I’ve been getting some text messages from some of my friends saying that Mira is accusing me of abandoning her and Max after I promised to take them. Some people are saying I’ve been an asshole, though I fail to see how.

1au8vl0,AITA for hiding food from my little sister?,"I (15F) am very dedicated to running, and have achieved a lot of success this year. I run cross country and track, and while the seasons aren’t going on I am constantly conditioning. I run for over an hour every day, and because of my dedication (and some lucky genetics) I’ve been selected for my schools varsity team as a freshman. I just broke 24 mins on a 5k. Since I’ve been exercising so much, my appetite has increased a lot as well. My younger sister “Beth” (12F) has noticed and decided that it’s her job to count my calories. She comments on every meal or snack I eat, and it has been really bugging me. This came to a climax recently, I got home from track practice, made dinner for my family (1st time making lasagna!). As soon as she sat down, the first thing Beth did was stare at my plate and say “that’s a big portion for a big girl!!!” (I’m 5’6” and weigh less than 100 pounds). My parents lightly scolded her, but I was still pissed since I made dinner and she was mocking me. It was a whole tray of lasagna, there was plenty for everybody. I brushed it off, but it bothered me. Later that night, I was studying and needed a snack. I went into the kitchen and cut up some strawberries. Beth jumped around the corner and yelled “GOTCHA FATTY!” Obviously her insults are sub par, but I was really upset. For context, we have plenty of food in the house. My parents don’t starve us or anything, which is why I don’t get why she’s acting this way. She then had the audacity to report me eating strawberries to my mom. Obviously my mom didn’t care, but didn’t care to discipline her either. So after she went to bed, I took a portion of food in the pantry and hid it in my room for me to eat. I wanted to be able to have snacks without someone judging my eating habits. My mom found the food in my room the next day, and is mad at me. I’m not allowed to keep food in my room. I understand that, and it is her house, and I told her why I was hiding food in my room. She told me I needed to be quieter while snacking to avoid conflict, or “eat less”. I felt awful, because she was implying I eat too much. I’m not at a point right now that I can eat just 3 meals a day. I’m running a minimum of 25 miles of week, and something’s gotta give. I’m afraid it’s gonna be my body. My mom took my phone, but I don’t care anymore. I plan to do the exact same thing again, but hide the food better this time.
