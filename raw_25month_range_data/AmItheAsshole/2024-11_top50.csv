1glbyny,AITA for disinviintg my daughter to Thanksgiving when she won't host Thanksgiving?,"Throwaway 

In our family, holidays are rotated, so one person hosts the Fourth of July, another hosts Christmas, and another hosts Thanksgiving etc.. This way, no one is constantly hosting, and it makes it fair for everyone. This post is about my middle daughter, Clara. Clara has always been skipping her host duties, when it gets to her she has an excuse why she can't host. It ranges but usually goes along the lines of stress or she is too busy. 

This results in other family members to pick up her holiday. It is frustrating and multiple people have talked to her about this. She bailed on hosting Easter but promised me that she would do Thanksgiving we swapped holidays. At the time I made it very clear she needed to stay true to her word and if she dumped it on someone else she wouldn't be going to Thanksgiving. It usually gets dumped on me.

Anyway, I called her asking if she wanted me to bring a dessert board for Thanksgiving. She told me that she could not host because she had just moved into her home (she moved in July), and it was too messy to host. I told her she could clean since it was a few weeks away. She told me she can't. 

I know the other kids can't host it, (well one could but she is doing Christmas and its not fair at all for her). I informed everyone it would beat my place this year. I also informed everyone that Clara is not invited this year to Thanksgiving.

Clara was pissed when I told her that and we got into a huge argument. She thinks I am a big jerk. My other kids are split, two of them are happy since they are tired of picking up her slack when this happens while others things this is too far.

1gtp5c4,AITA for refusing to let my brother bring his girlfriend to Thanksgiving after she disrespected my wife?,"I (31M) am married to Lily (30F). My brother Josh (29M) recently started dating Lindsey (27F), and while she’s been polite at family events, Lily feels Lindsey has made some passive-aggressive comments. For example, at a recent BBQ, Lindsey said it was “selfish” that Lily and I weren’t planning to have kids anytime soon. Lily felt uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything at the time. Another incident happened at a family dinner when Lindsey remarked, “I’m surprised you two are so happy without kids. You must be really good at being selfish.” Lily was hurt by that comment, and it made her feel like Lindsey was judging our life choices. Most recently, at a birthday party, Lindsey made a comment about Lily’s career, saying, “It’s cute that you’re working part-time with no kids while Josh and I are really focusing on our careers.” Lily was annoyed, but didn’t say anything because she didn’t want to start drama. Thanksgiving is at our house this year, and when Josh asked if he could bring Lindsey, I told him I’d prefer if she didn’t come. I explained that some of her comments had made Lily feel disrespected, and I didn’t want that to ruin the holiday. Josh got upset and said I was being petty. He argued that I was overreacting and that Lindsey was “just being honest,” but I stood my ground. Now Josh says he won’t come if Lindsey isn’t invited, and my parents are caught in the middle. My mom thinks I’m being too harsh, but I feel like I’m just standing up for my wife.

1gxm1qt,AITAH for stepping up when my little sister got her period.,"So I 14F and my little sister 12D have never been close. Classic sibling relationship. My mom and dad recently divorced and now my mom works A LOT. Sice then me and my sister (let's call her Ally) grew closer. We started talking more and hanging out and have a real relationship. So last night around 8pm Ally comes into my room in tears. I could instantly tell something was off so I asked and she said ""I think I startedy period"". I comforted and told her it was going to be alright and all that jazz. I show here how to use a pad and after that I got us some hot coco and sat on the couch to explain all of my big sister knowledge about periods and stuff. I didn't go into full detail because I wanted to respect my mom but I didn't want Ally to feel clueless l. After that I doordashed us some Taco Bell and we watched cheesy Hallmark movies. My mom got home around 10 and I told her what happened and she went crazy. She said I was overstepping and I should've called her and not have told Ally anything but just gave her a pad. She said I was ignoring her feelings and being ignorant. And that it was her job as a mother to explain everything to Ally. I tried to tell her I only said the basics but she just sent me to my room. 
   I feel awful and now I'm wondering am I the asshole.",Mrs_Colby_Brock,9291,1463,0.9700000286102295,0.622926297294961,1732319480,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gxm1qt/aitah_for_stepping_up_when_my_little_sister_got/,2024,11
1h1hofm,AITA for allowing my mother to bring Thanksgiving food to my house this year? Married with 3 kids and a pregnant wife,"1 week ago, my mother asked to spend Thanksgiving at our house this year and my brother and niece planned on tagging along. For context, my grandmother passed earlier this year and my family usually got together at her house for Thanksgiving. I told her we initially planned on visiting my in laws because they live closer to us and my wife wasnt enthusiastic about cooking this year, but I'd ask my wife to see if they had any concrete plans locked in. We then decided on staying here and hosting my family. I offered to cook to help out but my wife insisted that she wanted to cook. This was about a week ago.

Fast forward to today. My mother calls me and tells me she planned on bringing stuffing with turkey legs, fresh sweet potatoes, and a cake. My wife goes absolutely ballistic, saying it's extremely rude to bring food to someone's house for Thanksgiving. We get into an argument because I'm trying to say that shes just trying to be nice and help out, but my wife fully believes she is either trying to be rude or disrespectful and how as her husband I shouldnt have allowed it. She begins to talk to her family about how rude my mom is and just overall being angry towards me. To remedy this, I basically had to tell her not to bring any food and only the cake because it's acceptable. I personally didn't think it was such a problem given the situation, but apparently it is.

1gobtc8,AITA for offending my in-laws by deciding my daughters won’t have a Quinceanera and the reasons?,"Context: My husband (m 35) and I (f 34) have two daughters. The oldest Lexie (14) is not my husband's biological child but he has been nothing short of a father to her. Our second daughter Rosie (husbands bio) is just a baby.

Last weekend we got together with hubby’s family at his parent’s house. MIL started talking about how we need to prepare for Lexie’s Quinceanera next year. Hub’s family has joked multiple times about Lexie getting to have a Quince now that she’s an honorary Mexican thru my husband. My husband's family is from Mexico. I am not of Latino origin. They grew up in the Catholic faith. I did not. 

While I love that hubby’s family considers Lexie their own and includes her in other Mexican traditions, Quinceaneras are the one exception. I have told my husband before I don’t agree with what it historically represents and we aren’t Catholic. My husband has also said he understand this.

I tell my MIL that Lexie won’t be having a Quince and has told me she just wants to go do something with her friends. My MIL snapped at my husband in Spanish and left the room. I was then bombarded with both of my SILs, one their husbands, and my MIL from the other room demanding to know why Lexie couldn’t have a Quince. My husband told them to stand down but for the next 20 minutes they kept making passive aggressive comments like “poor Lexie won’t have a Quince like her little sister will.”


I finally said in a stern but calm tone ""I understand it's a tradition. But I do not agree with the original meaning of Quinces in that now a 15 year old is a woman and ready for marriage. I know it's modernized now and means they're just entering womanhood but I still don't agree with the symbolism. They’re kids. Besides *Husband* and I don’t practice Catholic faith. Lexie is not having a quince and I don't want Rosie to have one either.""

From all directions shouts of ""WHAT? Rosie HAS to have one!"" and ""Rosie is Mexican! You can decide for Lexie but not for Rosie!"" came from all my in-laws. All last week my husband was getting texts about how much I offended them and that a Quince (more so for Rosie as his bio kid) is a right of passage and marks a milestone into womanhood. I told my husband that if Rosie really wants one in the future I would be open to hearing her reasonings. But I won’t encourage or force her to. My husband hates confrontation and told me this morning that I'm the jerk for not just giving in because disagreeing with how they feel about Quinces is offensive to them.",Sad-Cell2569,3351,1897,0.8799999952316284,0.4868965429930633,1731275079,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gobtc8/aita_for_offending_my_inlaws_by_deciding_my/,2024,11
1gmwni8,AITA for telling DIL she married into the wrong family after a comment she made? ,"Im 62F and a busy single mother/grandma. 
3 of my kids live with me ages 22,26, and 32. My grandson(2yo) also lives with me. My oldest son (30) and his wife(28) visited last weekend and my DIL pulled me aside and made a comment that she’s “worried” about my kids and I because “things don’t seem to be changing” as far as my other kids moving out, or getting a higher education/careers. Also when i asked why they’ve been lessening visits, she answered “where will we sleep? the couch?” 
My DIL has been around for 8 years and we’ve always had a good relationship, but her question and comment came off very judgmental. I get it, she’s a nurse. She also encouraged my son to go to IT school, while the rest of my kids and I all live at home working normal jobs staying a float. I guess the fact that my adult kids have never moved out “concerns” her and my son mentioned she’s been feeling these things ever since they’ve started trying for a baby. I don’t understand that. 

To her comment, I told her “maybe you married into the wrong family then” and continued my night. My son told me I really hurt her feelings, but she also really hurt mine. She might mean well, but clearly we’re not good enough in her eyes because of the dynamic. AITA?

1gw1stq,AITA for expecting not to have to pay for Thanksgiving groceries?,"I have never posted here before, so my apologies if I make any mistakes. 

I (54f) have been invited by a friend (50f) who I will call Ann, to come to her house for Thanksgiving.  

We all live in Italy, but spent many years in the USA, and have several American friends in the area.  

Ann heard that I make a traditional Thanksgiving dinner at my house every year for my family and a couple friends (6 people total).  

It is quite difficult to get all of the supplies here (no buying canned pumpkin, or cranberry sauce!), so I make every single thing from scratch.  Over the years, I’ve also acquired all the dishes and tools and spices - know suppliers for the more exotic things, and am an all around good cook. 

So Ann, who was born in China but lived in the USA for 20+ years, asked if I would come to her beautiful (and much bigger) home, and “teach her” how to make the whole dinner.  

For a group of 12 people instead of the usual 6.  

I was hesitant at first, because we live a very modest lifestyle, and Ann and her (British) husband are very well off, but I figured it would still be fun, and I would enjoy putting on the feast for new people and in a beautiful kitchen. 

After I agreed, the problems began.  First, Ann wanted to have the dinner on a day that isn’t Thanksgiving, to make it more convenient.  I decided it wasn’t all that important, since we live in Italy.  So it is scheduled for the Sunday prior to the actual day. 

Then when we were planning to meet to go shopping for all the ingredients, she asked if I could do all the shopping and she would “reimburse me for her half”. 

I asked what she meant, and she said that I’d be paying for half of everything. 

So not only would I be doing all the shopping, all the planning, all the cooking and teaching her as well, but now I’m expected to pay for the food? 

I told her I could not do this (we really don’t have the budget!) so now she’s trying to alter the menu she agreed to (turkey & fixings, candied yams, roasted veggies, an appetizer, and pie).  Really a modest dinner by American standards. 

She then made a comment that “her” friends don’t “eat like pigs”.

She then went to another guest *with my recipes* and asked her to prepare my pumpkin pie so she didn’t have to buy the ingredients. 

Bear in mind, Ann and her husband are very wealthy.  I’d estimate the whole dinner for 12 might cost €200 for the ingredients, and my labor Ann gets for free. 

She thinks I’m being “stubborn and ungenerous” (ie an AH) 

My family thinks Ann is  taking advantage of my kindness and her miserly ways are ridiculous, since she’d spend double that amount for lunch out on a whim. 

So AITA for refusing to “contribute” to the meal or be bullied into this nonsense?  My family wants me to just bow out and tell her I’m not comfortable with her attitude.  I’m tempted, because this feels toxic and manipulative.

1gs9x9a,WIBTA for not deleting my sons baby pictures? ,"My 45F son, 18M, has transitioned from a female to a male about 4-5 years ago. I ,myself, thought that it’s a little too early to start transitioning, but I didn’t say anything and decided to be supportive. After all, that’s my child!

Anyway, a few days ago, my son saw me scrolling through my camera roll and yelled at me because I was tearing up at his baby pictures, where he was still dressed extremely femininely and was obviously a girl. I wasn’t crying at it because he isn’t a girl anymore, I was crying because time flies! He told me that by me keeping those photos as memories, I am totally disregarding the fact that he is no longer a girl and I am transgender phobic.

My heart was saddened by this because that is the last thing I will ever be. I have open arms to anyone and everyone. 

I personally believe that it’s not fair for me to delete the photos because those are some of the only memories I have of him when he was an infant/kid.

1gsyytu,AITA for refusing to force my daughter to shave for a wedding? And backing out of paying for it when we were uninvited?,"I honestly can’t believe this situation has come to this, and I really need some outsider perspective. 
I’m a 35yr old man, and I was two beautiful daughters, Lucy (7) and Molly (16). I adopted them both and have raised them by myself for their entire lives. I also have a sister, Julie (33F) who is getting married in two months to Paul (35M). 
Both Julie and Paul are lower middle class and have been saving for years for their very expensive dream wedding. Even with all the prep, they’re about $14,000 short.
I own a law firm and am doing quite well, so I offered to help cover the remaining cost. 
The trouble arose last week when Julie and I took Molly and Lucy dress shopping. She picked out a short sleeved, just above the knee dress for Molly. It looked beautiful on her, and everything was fine until Julie said that Molly would have to shave. 
Molly is autistic and generally has Low Support Needs, but sensory issues are a big one for her. She doesn’t shave any body hair at all because the of the feeling (which is 100% okay in my book, her body her choice). So when Julie said this, I told her no, that Molly would not do that and she could either pick a longer dress or let her be. Julie got heated and we left without purchasing anything. 
The next day, Julie asked if I had thought about how foolish I was being and Molly needed to learn to suck it up, that nobody wanted to see that blah blah blah. Things escalated again, and she ended up uninviting us. I told her that was fine, it was her wedding.
I hadn’t heard from her until today, when she called to ask me when they could discuss what I would be paying for and when. I asked if she was joking, and told her because she uninvited us, I wouldn’t be paying a cent. She  started to freak out, first getting angry and then began to cry over the phone. I hung up on her. 
She apparently called our mom, aunts, and grandparents and told them I was ruining her wedding. Now I’m getting calls about how cruel and heartless I am, and that I’m not entitled to have my kids at the wedding. Especially from my mom, who reminded me that this Julie’s big day and she’s been dreaming about it since she was little. Some people think I should just pay even if we can’t go, while others say that Molly needs to grow up and get over it. I think someone who can’t accept my daughter doesn’t deserve my money.

1gzwdpg,"AITA for ruining my brother’s childhood memory by admitting I photoshopped it 14 years ago?
","When my younger brother (20 now) was 6, he went through a huge Harry Potter phase. He loved the wizarding world and believed he might meet ‘Harry Potter’ (Daniel Radcliffe) or the other characters on a family trip to Scotland since Hogwarts was ‘there.’ No one promised him this, but he convinced himself it could happen. Sadly, the trip was canceled after our grandpa passed away, and my brother was devastated for both reasons.

To cheer him up, I decided to craft a 'souvenir'. I was 16 and had just discovered photoshop, so I edited a picture of my brother with Daniel Radcliffe to make it look like they'd met. I printed it, framed it, and gave it to him without telling him it was fake. He loved it and fully believed he’d met Daniel. Soon, he had an entire story about the meeting; what they talked about, how Daniel hugged him, etc. It was so sweet, and none of us (my family and I) had the heart to tell him the truth.

Fast forward 14 years, and my brother still didn’t know that the old, low quality picture of him meeting Daniel Radcliffe is fake. I never told him because his memory of the fake meeting felt so real to him that it became one of his proudest stories. Over time the memory became less important and the framed picture had been packed away in some box, and my brother has long outgrown his Harry Potter obsession. Yesterday, however, we were at our parents' home and we were bringing up old memories, you know how it goes. The story of meeting Daniel Radcliffe came up, and thinking it was harmless, I told him the truth. I thought he’d laugh but instead he got visibly upset. He didn’t want to believe me at first, thinking I was messing with him. I told him the real story of how and why I did it. He told me that it feels like I robbed him of a real childhood memory that he really cherished, and he feels embarrassed thinking about all the times he's told people about meeting Daniel Radcliffe in person, even recently. We ended our conversation on a semi-good note, though. I apologised for not telling him sooner, because I do feel bad that it meant so much to him even now. But I don’t regret it. Back then, it made him so happy during a rough time, and I don’t regret giving him that joy. I just didn't realize how much it still meant to him. So I'm just wondering, am (or was) I the a-hole?

1gjquni,AITA for telling a wheelchair bound lady her service dogs should not be at the playground.  ,"Throwaway, People are making me feel like i'm nuts here, and I can't believe this is real.  

Last friday my Wife and I took our 2 kids under 3 to the playground in our neighborhood park.  This was a rare Friday where there were no commitments as we usually take them first thing in the morning.    

As we approached we noticed there were probably a dozen kids there and 2 large labs running in the grassy area unleashed.  My wife and I are like the dogs shouldn't be there unleashed but our little guy was excited to be at the playground.  So we continued.  We let our boy run around and the younger one we put in the swing.  Some parents that were there started talking to us.  They are essentially one big neighborhood parent group and meet up weekly.  I didn't know anyone in this group.  

My son climbed a structure and went down a slide.  Once he was off the slide there were no kids on that structure.  A lady that had the 2 dogs there (I still don't know if she was a parent), let the dogs onto the playground structure and let them go down the slide. 

I spoke up to this lady and told her to keep her dogs off the equipment.  She told me they were her service dogs.  I said, i don't think service dogs play on playground equipment.  She snaps back to me service dogs are allowed to take breaks. She continues saying that we are here every week and no one has ever complained.  I say that not everyone is comfortable around dogs and tell her I think its selfish to let your dogs on the equipment especially when children are around.   

Some parents support her and said as much to my wife and I.    She told me that I should make sure my kids are comfortable around dogs before bringing them around dogs.   I told this lady that she was insane and completely missed my point.  My wife and I left after this.  We noticed a facebook post about us (that we have not engaged) and it seems its 50/50 on if we are the assholes.  ",Elegant-Climate-6953,2974,1232,0.8799999952316284,0.3456423387162978,1730758292,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gjquni/aita_for_telling_a_wheelchair_bound_lady_her/,2024,11
1glcer9,AITA for not waking up my roommate on the day of his final med school exam?,"
I (23M) and my roommate Justin (23M) are med students. We've been living together as roommates for two years, and  we live in a hostel. 

Last week were our final year exams, and it was absolute hell. We were surviving on 2-3 hours of sleep daily, fueled by coffee and energy drinks (I know it’s not healthy but there’s no other way to pass lol). 

On the last day of exams, Justin was unusually exhausted. Around 1 am, he decided to sleep and told me to wake him up at 3 am. I agreed.

However, by 2:30 am, I was dead. My brain was shutting down, my notes were getting blurry and I knew if I stayed up any longer, I'd pass out. I decided to wake Justin up early.

I woke Justin up at 2:30 am and told him the time and suggested he set an alarm so he wouldn't oversleep. Justin sat upright, rubbed his eyes, and nodded and said ‘alright’. 

I was like ‘don’t forget to set the alarm’ and then almost instantly fell asleep.

We both woke up at 8 AM. (I had set my alarm for 6 but I kept hitting snooze). Justin freaked out, accusing me of not waking him up as promised. 

I reminded him that I did wake him up at 2:30 AM and suggested he set an alarm. Justin said that he was too sleepy to comprehend what’s happening and insisted that I should have stayed awake to wake him at 3 AM or at least made sure he was fully awake before sleeping. 

Justin's exam didn't go well, and now he's blaming me.

I understand his frustration, but I think he's being unfair.

1goe8uc,WIBTA if I told my wife she can’t take our 3 month old daughter to Australia on holiday without me? ,"So my wife and I just welcomed our first born to the world - the last 6 weeks with her have been absolutely incredible! We both love her to bits, it’s been an intense learning curve but every day there’s something new to marvel at with her. 

There is something hanging over us both right now though…she mentioned to me in passing about 6 months ago that she’d like to travel to Australia with the baby to visit her family for a couple of weeks during maternity leave. We never really discussed it in depth at the time, I think I said something along the lines of ‘Okay cool let’s maybe wait until the babies here safely’ type thing. My wife didn’t really push the point and I didn’t really think much of it. 

Fast forward to a week ago and we’re sat at a dinner table with my wife’s family (and our month old daughter :) ) and they start talking about specific flights and plans they’re making. Australia hasn’t been mentioned to me for 6 months. I had no idea that it was going ahead and it turns out the trip is only a matter of weeks away (9). All I could feel was sheer panic and I realised I really don’t want to spend that long not seeing my amazing new little baby (and my wife too!). 

After dinner I told my wife how I felt. I knew that she’d mentioned it before but hearing the detailed plans had me panicking as it was becoming a reality. I really don’t want her to go to the other side of the world (we live in London) with our newborn without me. I don’t think she’s fully considered how difficult and stressful flying solo long haul with a baby and 3 weeks worth of luggage would be. But, from my perspective I don’t want my daughter to be that far away from me for that long at such an early age. I’m just getting used to being a Dad and all I want to do with every moment of my spare time right now is spend it with my new family. During three weeks I could miss some amazing first moments, but also should anything happen I’d be absolutely helpless 10,000 miles away. 

Me travelling for 3 weeks on this short notice is out of the question, I can’t get that time off work. Does it make me an asshole for not wanting them to go?

1gl98v5,AITA For Telling My BIL that If His Wife Will Not Want to Have a Relationship With Me then I Will not Have My Children to Have a Relationship with Her.,"Background where everybody is coming from.

I am married to my BIL’s brother. My BIL’s wife went NC with the family a couple years ago. We did not realize it until my other SIL found out that she had her blocked on social media. That’s when everything unfolded that she had done it to all of us. She also blocked our phone numbers. When we asked my BIL about it, my BIL said there were too many dramas going on in the family that SIL does not want to be part of or involved with and that we are toxic, we are too much for her and that SIL is too busy to spend her free time being around our “energy”. 

SIL also did not appreciate the family jokes, BIL did not give an example but what stuck with me was my MIL told my BIL at their housewarming party when his friend arrived “why my BIL did not marry his best friend instead of his wife?” in front of my SIL, which she was only joking because the friend arrived in a nice car. I also did not like the joke, but my SIL did not say anything.

I admit that some members of our family would stir up drama here and there but at the end of the day we are still family. We do not see eye to eye, but we are still family.

So, this happened last weekend. One of my husband’s cousins got married where my BIL and his wife were in attendance. My BIL sent a group text that his wife will be there in support of their cousin and his wife (SIL is a good friend of the bride). BIL said that SIL would not want to discuss the issues, that it was not our day, and asked to give SIL the space.

The entire wedding she talked and laughed with the extended family and friend, she played with my children and my other SIL’s children but ignored us. She did not even look at us nor acknowledged us. She even turned her back on my husband when he tried to approach her. We are all hurt from her actions because to this date we do not know what we did that was so bad that we deserve the treatment.

So, I finally had it and told my BIL that if his wife would not want to have a relationship with us, then she is not allowed to have a relationship with my children.

I heard on the background her saying, “that’s low and manipulative but she is the parent so, okay. Don’t worry “name of their child” can still have a relationship with them if they want to. Your family is exhausting, please deal with it”

My BIL told me I am manipulative for pulling this BS but respect my decision then hang up. I tried texting him my reasons, but he was not responding.

1h2yif9,AITA for yelling at a lady on her phone before Wicked?,"Just left the movie and I'm curious. 

The first video saying turn off your phone goes and she's scrolling on Facebook with her brightness up. The second video saying to get off your phone goes and she's still on it, so I yell down (it's stadium seating) like 3 rows for her to turn it off. She did the rest of the show too! 

After the movie, a lady says I have an ugly voice and I joke that I love compliments on my voice. And I loudly say to my friend if I wonder if that's the lady I yelled at after she wouldn't listen to Jeff Goldblum to turn off her phone. And I say stay mad when she and her husband were shaking their heads in disgust. 

So AITAH?

Edit: The lady stayed off her phone. My friend joked I scared everyone straight, lol.

Edit 2: Wow, this blew up! Here are some answers to a few questions that are popping up 

1. This was well past when the trailers were done and was obviously right before the movie started. Literally, the movie started almost immediately after.

2. No, I wasn't singing or doing anything that made me a bad audience member. My voice is just Miley Cyrus level loud and raspy, and the lady recognized my voice while walking out. 

Edit 3: Yinz, I love that one of my neighbors who was there in the theater with me showed up in the comments here. 🖤💛",FertilityFoes,3518,744,0.8999999761581421,0.27226091091436333,1732921825,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h2yif9/aita_for_yelling_at_a_lady_on_her_phone_before/,2024,11

1gw0he1,AITA for being ungrateful and not eating the brownies my gf made for me? ,"
Yesterday my gf surprised me with some homemade brownies. She baked them specifically for me, she was so thoughtful and used all vegan ingredients. It made me feel both so valued and cared for but also stressed because I knew I wouldn't like them, because I can not handle the chewy texture of them. But she didn't know that. I love the chocolate flavor so she must have thought i would ike brownies too. 

I thanked and then told her I'm really not good with chewy textures. She insisted that I take a bike so I did. I could barely swallow it. smiled and hid my disgust the best I could because I knew she would be offended. 

I must suck at faking my reaction because she immediately asked me does it really taste that horrible? I said it no it's not about that, I just can't handle the chewy textures. I told her it has nothing to with the taste or her baking and not to take it personal. 

Unfortunately she did. She told me I'm ungrateful and I could just take few bites and tell her I will save the rest for the later like a normal person. 

I apologized and said I don't think I will be able to take more bites. That really upset her. She said fine I will fucking throw them away then and throw them into garbage. She was so upset the whole time and decided to not stay over so I gave a ride . She was upset during the ride too and slammed the door when she was leaving. 

I don’t know how to feel all about this. AITA?",peterlikeschicken,3513,704,0.9100000262260437,0.2644165494881253,1732139670,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gw0he1/aita_for_being_ungrateful_and_not_eating_the/,2024,11

1gw0pcq,AITA for Kicking My Boyfriend Out because he Didn’t Take Me to My Oral Surgery?,"
I recently had oral surgery to get my wisdom teeth removed, and I needed a designated driver. I asked my boyfriend if he could take me, and he said he’d find out if he could. Over the past few days, he seemed excited about the idea, even joking about wanting to see how I’d act under anesthesia.

Fast forward to this morning, the day of my surgery. I asked him if he was still going to take me, and he said no. He told me he needed to get a haircut for a presentation he has tomorrow, as the rubric says he should be “well-groomed.” For context, I think his hair already looks fine, but he said he doesn’t like it.

Luckily, I had a backup plan and asked another friend to take me, but I was still really upset. I told him that I wanted him there and was hurt that he backed out at the last minute. He told me it wasn’t his obligation to take me and pointed out that I had other people who could step in, so I shouldn’t be mad.

I feel conflicted. I get that it’s not technically his “obligation,” but I also feel like, as my boyfriend, he should want to prioritize something as important as a medical procedure over a haircut. At the same time, I understand his perspective that he needs to feel confident and professional for his presentation.

1gwqvh6,AITA - For admitting to my husband that I'm uncomfortable with certain children in our home?,"Hello, 31f married to my husband, 35m. Together 10.5 years. We have no kids and live in our house with our elderly dog. We are both from a small city, and a few years ago decided to move to a bigger city nearby.

In recent years, close friends and family have started families and ask to come stay with us when in big city, with their small kids.

Our house isn't really kid-friendly, I child-proof best I can to make it safe for guests. I prepare toys, snacks, Disney+, make it a friendly place. I generally enjoy spending time with the kids in my life. 

My husband's sister's youngest son (5) has severe behavioral issues. He's been kicked out of 3 daycares and has diagnosed with ODD and ADHD. My SIL comes over for days-long visits with her 3 kids, and he is a huge challenge. He knocks furniture over, throw things around, he's broken several of my items. He snoops in every single room, constantly. Opens every drawer and cupboard to pull things out. SIL ignores it, I'm the one chasing him around trying to stop him. I am so uncomfortable having my personal spaces invaded.

I once found him snooping in our bedroom. He grabbed something very inappropriate from a drawer and was about to run into the main room with it when I grabbed it.

I'm the only adult trying to stop him. Husband and SIL do and say nothing. I tried setting boundaries of rooms that are off limits with my most personal items, but they were ignored. 

As well, my husband's best friends have a 4 year old boy who is very disrespectful in our house. He insults us, screams at my dog, snoops around, wipes his nose on couch pillows and his parents don't do a thing. I don't expect perfect behavior, I just want decent manners and respect in my home.

Now, whenever these specific people ask to come stay with us, I'm filled with anxiety and dread.

During SIL's most recent visit, my husband allowed nephew into an off-limits room and he broke a little Lego item my friends' kid made me. Afterwards I told him how I felt about it and that I was struggling with my discomfort.

He was offended. ""Every time kids come over, you have a complaint/ kids will be kids / you need to lighten up."" Said I'm overreacting about the Lego and it wasn't a big deal. I said the point is that a boundary of mine had been ignored and an item was broken, again.

I explained I have no problems with kids if they can behave. I mentioned the incident of nephew handling a bedroom item. My husband said that I shouldn't let it bother me, and to try to find it funny instead.

I know a big part of his defensive reaction is because SIL's family is the only real family he has. I understand that he's trying to just have a good time with them in his home without negativity.

I want to mention I've always conveyed my concerns to him in a respectful and mature way. I still wonder, if I'm actually TA here and maybe I'm being too negative when my husband is just trying to enjoy time with what little family he has left.",thunderstormthursday,3358,565,0.9800000190734863,0.23208010437087662,1732224576,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwqvh6/aita_for_admitting_to_my_husband_that_im/,2024,11
1h1i4x2,AITA for telling my Parter I will no longer help her watch the kids while she works from home. (stay at home dad),"I (M30s) have been a stay-at-home dad for three and a half years. We have two young children—18 months and 3.5 years old. This all started when I moved across the country for a job that simply didn't exist at her uncle's snack company, despite her and her mother swearing up and down it did (and her actually getting her job there). To take this ""fake"" job, I had to quit my job in Minnesota, which meant that when COVID hit shortly after, I didn't qualify for any unemployment benefits or assistance. I burned through my savings. Since she still had a job, we decided I'd stay home with the kids to avoid expensive CA childcare costs.

Here's the problem: she works from home in our 1300 sq ft house with paper-thin walls. She takes meetings all day in the next room, which means I have to keep the kids quiet for most of the day. It's incredibly stressful and makes it almost impossible to do anything with them.

When we made this arrangement, she promised to find a separate workspace outside the house—a she-shed, a converted garage, anything!—but four years later, that still hasn't happened. To make matters worse, she controls all the finances, refuses to fix up the house (even issues that affect the kids!), and has never included me in financial decisions or given me any kind of allowance. She makes a good salary, but she's a terrible spender. Every year, she blows through our savings, and we end up having to ""catch up"" financially, which means there's never any money for family activities, home improvements, or anything else. I feel like I have no say in how our money is spent, even though I'm the one sacrificing my career and income for our family.

I need surgery on my ankle so I can walk properly again, but it requires a 3-6 month recovery period. My wife refuses to even discuss having a family member come help with the kids so I can get this done. I've applied for disability twice, and even though all the doctors agree (even the ones they hired) say I need it, I've been denied.

I love my kids more than anything, but I'm starting to feel like I have no control over my own life or them. I've tried to find a non-standing work-from-home job, but they're all 9-5, which defeats the purpose of me being home with the kids.

1h26mk2,AITA for kicking my niece out of my apartment when she needed my help?,"My wife (26F) and I (27M) live a relatively quiet life. My sister has two kids, one of which being my niece (15F), whom we'll call J. As her younger brother, I know very well that living with my sister sucks, so I have sympathy for my niece, who gets into arguments with her mom. Now J isn't exactly an angel either, the whole family knows that. Well this year, J asked me personally if she could stay with me in my apartment for the summer break, because she and her mom got into a particularly nasty argument, and she wanted ""help and guidance"". I hesitantly agreed, and said she could stay for two months.

Unfortunately, there are a lot issues with J.
1. She is a pathological liar. 50% of everything she says is untrue, and she will lie to your face even if you know the truth. 
2. I have a cabinet full of alcohol that we save for family gatherings and date nights. We don't drink otherwise. I hid the alcohol from J. She found it, and within 3 days, drank EVERYTHING. When I looked into the hiding place all the bottles were empty. 
3. I placed security cameras in the house because of her, and caught her on tape stealing money from my wallet
4. She broke a few of our things out of anger, and when we asked her about it, she said it was an ""accident"" (it was on camera).
5. I tried multiple times to spend time with her and connect with her but she never showed me any respect or seriousness. Everything is a joke.
6. The straw that broke the camel's back is when I confronted her about the alcohol and money she stole, she not only didn't apologize, but lied saying that my wife did all those things and is trying to frame her because she hates her. Even after telling her I have footage of her doing it, she still kept saying she didn't do it and ""I'm conspiring against her"".

I lost my marbles. It has only been five weeks, but I was done. I called my sister and told her J is coming in the morning. J begged me not to send her back. I asked her ""why not stay with your aunt or your father?"", to which she said neither will let her stay with them because they are ""conspiring against her too"". Surprise, she had stolen from them and lied to them too, so no one wants anything to do with her. I didn't care, and drove her back home to her mom, and informed my sister of what J has done. She was furious with J, so I left immediately.

I will never allow them into my house again. I feel a bit bad, because again, her mom is always angry, and her family wants nothing to do with her. It also probably didn't help I told her mom. But still, these are the consequences of her own actions. What do you think? Am I the asshole?

1gpyy2x,AITA for shaming a male coworker about menstruation?,"I (34M) got into a heated argument at work with my coworker (31M). For background, he's the ""I tell it like it is"" type who uses that as an excuse to be insensitive, and frankly, bully others into getting what he wants. Dude has anger issues, and has often talked about possibly fighting people. My own toxic trait is that I'm a people pleaser, so I almost never challenge things he says.

Yesterday another coworker (27F) called out because she's having a particularly difficult menstrual period with severe cramps. When I visited her before work to take supplies, she was really pale and could barely stand up. Our boss was understanding, and national law provides menstrual leave in our country.

At work, the male coworker said having a period isn't being sick and not an excuse to miss work. Perhaps it's because I'm close to the other coworker, and perhaps it's because I'm sick of his attitude, but I told him calmly he doesn't have a uterus, so don't talk about whether having a period is being sick. He said, ""Don't fucking tell me not to talk!"" and I matched his energy and said, ""I'll tell anyone not to say misogynistic shit around me!"" and then he backed down quietly saying it wasn't misogyny. Didn't talk to me or even look in my direction for the rest of the day.

I do feel like I could've worded things better in the moment, but I stand by what I said in general: if you don't have a uterus or menstruate, you don't have any grounds to talk about it (myself included). Also while I don't think he's a full blown misogynist, I do think it's a textbook microaggression to ignore what billions of women throughout history have been saying, thinking you know better.

1h1gsay,AITA for giving my daughter 3 Fritos?,"I (35F) and my husband (44M) recently had our first and only child together. Our daughter is 17 months old. 


After having her, a constant source of conflict is her food. Our daughter started solid foods at 5 months. She started with rice cereal mixed with breast milk. We started to introduce purees after that. My husband wanted her to only have vegetable purees and he told me was giving her too much fruit.

So, eventually, I was able to convince him that she could have both fruit and vegetable purees. Then I had to convince him to let her eat bread. The one and only approved bread was Ezekiel bread, which was because it is a source of complete protein. 

She is not allowed any added sugar. On the surface, this is something I would agree to. I don't think she needs to be eating candy. But my husband means this extremely literally. So, for example, my daughter cannot have Cheerios because they have added sugar. Even the very low sugar version at Trader Joe's, with <1g of added sugar, was vetoed. Another example is that I was giving her baby yogurt, from the baby food aisle, and had to stop because it had added sugar. 

And I get it, to a point, added sugar is insidious here in the United States and in so many foods it shouldn't be, but at the same time, I have sent him multiple articles about how restricting foods usually creates unhealthy relationships with food, and it is better to teach how to enjoy treats in moderation. 

So, this culminated into the event last night that is inspiring the title of my post: I was eating Fritos, and let my daughter have a taste. She had already had her dinner. She had, probably, 3 Fritos. (And she shared them with the dog.) My husband came in and I earned the Dirty Judgemental Look. I was supposed to know Fritos are not allowed. As I usually do when I have learned of a not-allowed food, I asked, why not? Why is it not allowed? 

He INSISTS he is not worried about her weight. He says, ""It is bad for you."" I asked why, and he mouthed at me, ""Are you a r*tard?"" 

I reiterated my previous points that teaching moderation is healthier and I don't want my daughter to have a bad self-image because her dad is obsessed with what she eats.
He countered, ""That is like giving her cigarettes and telling her to smoke in moderation."" Which... it isn't. A Frito is not even remotely close to a cigarette. But in his mind, all ""bad for you"" things are the same and should be 100% avoided.

He says he shouldn't have to tell me which foods are forbidden, that I should just know. I can't possibly know, because they are ridiculous and on top of that, inconsistent. He says he feels like I am doing things behind his back. I say I am teaching my daughter to have a healthy relationship with food. He also doesn't eat this way himself, and never has. We were married 9 years before we had a child.

So, AITA for letting my 17-month-old daughter taste a Frito?",tabiloveskuma,1131,845,0.9200000166893005,0.20354047571807893,1732746402,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h1gsay/aita_for_giving_my_daughter_3_fritos/,2024,11
1gxlf4r,WIBTA if I tell my husbands ex she has to move out?,"I (35F) have been married to my husband (37M) for 1 year but we've been together for 3. He has 2 children (6F) (8M) from his previous relationship. (We do not have any kids together.) Their mom Anne (34F) has one other child (4F). They have a good co-parenting relationship and Anne and I get along. The Last week when Anne picked up the kids (we have week on week off) she told us that the kids might need to spend a few weeks with us because her and her current husband are getting a divorce. The house is in his name (he had it when they got together) and she's been a stay at home mom for their whole relationship. She said she was going to stay with her sister but they don't have enough room for all 3 kids.

I jumped in before my husband could say anything and offered her the guest room and told her the girls can share a room here just like they do at her house. That way she didn't have to miss her time with the kids and we could help with her daughter while she gets a job and gets things figured out. She thanked us and said she'd let us know when she would be moving out as soon as she could.

My husband asked me if was 100% okay with it, and that it would be fair to get her in here and then have an issue later. I told him I was okay and we'd work through anything that comes up.

That was 3 months ago, she's lived with us for 2 months now and everything is great. It's actually better than great if I'm being honest. Having her here means I don't have to take both kids to the store if I need something for dinner. Housework is divided between 3 people. She's gotten a job and isn't having to pay for childcare (which is about $700 a week in our area) Even though I told her she didn't have to she is giving us $500 a month for bills.

I was talking to my sister and cousin at our early thanksgiving and my sister said I'm crazy for letting her stay with us. That I'm ""devaluing myself as a partner"" and ""being an asshole to myself"" for allowing this to continue. My cousin agrees with her. She said the only reason his ex would agree to stay is if she still wanted to sleep with him and him agreeing means he wants it too.

I don't see them behaving any differently than before, and I truly trust my husband. But now I'm starting to doubt my decision. WIBTA if I tell her she needs to find somewhere else to live? AITA to myself if I don't listen to them and let her stay?

Update:

Thank you all for your comments. You're right, this isn't the first time I've let my older sister's comments get into my head. I sent her a text and told her that my household isn't her concern and if she doesn't trust the man in her life she should focus on her own. Thanks for the reality check.

1gvzlak,WIBTA If I refused to watch my brother's baby while he and his wife go off and do MDMA all day,"My brother and his wife live out of town and are coming for a visit over the Thanksgiving holidays. They have asked my mom and I to reserve a day to spend 8 hours (possibly more) watching their 1 year old baby, my niece. Meanwhile, they want to go off and do MDMA together all day. I love my niece and she's an easy baby, but I also don't know much about taking care of a baby, and my aging mother hasn't doesn't it in over 30 years, especially for this long. They have left us with their baby for 4 hours before while they went to a movie when they visited last time (baby was 6 months old). We played with her, fed her, put her down for a nap.

So, part of me is thinking, “okay maybe it's not that hard to take care of the baby for a few hours.” But I really don't want to for that long, especially so they can go off and do drugs. It's not like an emergency and they needed me. On the other hand, I get that it's their ""date day,” and they don't often get to be alone just the two of them anymore, and she just finished breastfeeding last month, thus she is more free now with what she puts in her body.

I'm also concerned that my mother and I will have questions and they will be unreachable for so long. It's not my obligation to watch their kid! That's the bottom line I'm trying to tell myself. But I still feel like an a-hole for wanting to say no to this.


TLDR: my brother and his wife want to leave for a day to have a date day to do MDMA. Am I the a-hole if I prevent them from going on their date day because I don't want to watch their baby for 8 hours?

1h0p9qy,AITA for not keeping up the family tradition? ,"My (25M) wife (24F) gave birth to our son two weeks ago. My family has had the tradition of naming the child months of the year for 5 generations on my mum's side. My name is December (I’ve shortened it to Dec hoping people will think it’s short for Declan or something normal), my brothers are called August (not so common in the UK) and July (poor guy, nothing you can do about that one) and my sisters are called April, June and May (not so bad). 

My wife and I called our son Tobias. We kept the name a secret until after he was born and we had signed the birth certificate so it couldn’t be changed. When we told my parents a week ago, they were most certainly not happy. Even though my dad has the nice normal name of Alex, he liked the tradition. My sister, June, named her daughter March to keep with the tradition so my parents expected me to do the same. My mum continually said that we should call the baby September for a girl and October for a boy throughout the pregnancy. I never outright said I wasn’t going to because I know what lengths they would go to to make sure my baby would have a month as a name. My brothers were on board when we told them, understanding growing up with the teasing. My parents left after saying we were disrespecting my heritage by not following the tradition. I told them I wasn’t going to name my child a ridiculous name because some old, long dead, crazy man decided months of the year would be good names and just because my mum was stupid enough to join him and his madness, didn’t mean I had to. They stormed out and haven’t spoken to me since. 

My sisters have said I should have just named him a month to keep the peace and I’m an asshole for insulting my mum and her family. I feel as though I’m just looking out for what’s best for my son. My family seems to think my wife has “brainwashed” me into calling him something normal even though I have never made it a secret that I hate my name. 

So am I the asshole? ",User593768,1936,556,0.9599999785423279,0.17789591697013835,1732661410,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h0p9qy/aita_for_not_keeping_up_the_family_tradition/,2024,11
1gkkfvc,AITA for my girlfriend not getting into the school she wanted?,"My girlfriend is a non-traditional college student. She completed her associate's last spring with a very high GPA and meant to apply to some prestigious schools. Whenever she started working on her applications, though, she would panic and shut down. She ended up missing all of her deadlines; she did complete her application for one Ivy League school, but didn't submit it at the last moment, saying it was embarrassing and that she had no place there.

I didn't know what to do in these moments, to be honest, but I am sure what I did wasn't right. She would really shut down and pull into herself, going into a thousand yard stare or breaking down in tears. I tried consoling her, but I can't remember a time it worked. I read over her application essays and made suggestions, but she would get defensive and reject them. I'm a pretty bad writer and she's a very good one, so that was likely the right call.

Now she's at a local public university and in tears every day because she finds it isn't the right fit. She blames me and tells me I didn't help enough, that she never felt supported through the process. I asked how I could have helped, and she called me an asshole, saying she didn't know ""how to explain how to help people."" She says she doesn't know if she can forgive me for this.

I am willing to accept I'm the asshole and I'm what's holding her back, but I legitimately don't know what I should have done. How does one help an adult shutting down? What was I supposed to do in this situation? I honestly feel terrible, and having no idea what my proper role should have been just makes it worse.",ThrowRA_pangolin129,1727,578,0.949999988079071,0.17439839219520975,1730848923,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gkkfvc/aita_for_my_girlfriend_not_getting_into_the/,2024,11
1gvaubn,AITA for not canceling a non-refundable trip for Thanksgiving,"My in-laws always do Thanksgiving the Saturday after. My husband (28M) and I (26F) bought tickets to a dinner theater over a year ago that are non-refundable (almost $200) When we purchased them, we didn’t realize it was the Saturday after until about 2 weeks later. I immediately texted my MIL letting her know that if they did it the Saturday after this year (2024) we wouldn’t be able to make it. (Texted her 11/10/2023) We invited them to our house for actual Thanksgiving day as my husband and I (and kids) stay home on actual holidays. They of course complained and my FIL told my husband that he knew they did Thanksgiving the Saturday after and that it seems we are just waiting for a funeral. (We have a medically complex son, they live an hour away and it’s hard to travel with him) AITA for not eating the cost of those tickets because they decided to still stay on the weekend after even after we told them over a year ago that we wouldn’t be able to go? 

Update: I am not at all upset that they DIDN’T change the day, ultimately it is up to them on when they want to host it. Personally I just think it’s not exactly fair for them to expect us to change our plans that we made over a year ago and informed them of the date. 

2nd update: please see some of my comments there is a character limit on this portion. I should have checked the date and I admit that, we haven’t had a date in almost three years and just got excited and I didn’t think to check when Thanksgiving was. They also don’t care to see or talk to us the rest of the year, it only becomes a problem on holidays. 

3rd edit : Funeral comment was made because we aren’t able to see them that often due to our sons needs and the travel with our son, that we are basically just waiting for one of them to die. (He was drunk when he sent it… so that’s was our interpretation of it) 

4th edit : gotta make this one short, they were reminded multiple times throughout the year that we wouldn’t be able to make this year if it was on the 30th. No issues came up until 3 days ago. And we never wanted them to change the date if they didn’t want to it’s up to them and I don’t expect them to change their schedule because of us.

1gqr1oh,AITA for not letting my 19-year-old sister live with me and my husband anymore? ,"I (24F) and my husband (23M) live in his parents’ basement suite as we save up for our own home. My parents and younger siblings live abroad, but I’ve been here with my two older brothers for years. Sadly, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and my family came here for better healthcare. Unfortunately, she passed away three months ago, and now the rest of my family has decided to stay.

My dad and younger brother live with my eldest brother Mike (32M), his wife, and their baby. Their home isn’t big enough for my 19-year-old sister, so they asked if she could stay with us. We agreed, feeling bad for her.

However, it’s been a nightmare. She sleeps in the basement living room, which she keeps messy. She wakes up around 5 p.m., doesn’t help with housework, doesn’t cook, and spends all her time playing video games. She can’t work here due to visa issues, so my husband and I pay for everything—food, utilities, etc. She never thanks us and expects everything handed to her.

I’ve been on stress leave from work for two months and have taken on most of the cooking and cleaning. Everyone else works, so I’ve been doing my part. I’ve tried to get my sister to pitch in, like serving herself when I cook, but she complains. Recently, she asked for something, and I snapped, saying no. She got upset and said she “hopes she follows Mom” because she’s “being abused” here. My husband and I were furious. We’re doing everything for her, and she says that?

She started posting on Instagram about how she’s a “victim” here, all while still living in our space. She even told Mike that she doesn’t want to stay with us because “no one is taking care of her.” Mike told her, “You’re 19; figure it out.”

We stopped talking, but she’s still living here. After two weeks of silence, I finally told her to pack her bags and find somewhere else to stay. Even my in-laws, who have been angels and incredibly helpful to my family, subtly hinted they don’t want her here anymore. For them to say that is a big deal.

My other brother Josh (26M) has a studio apartment and agreed to let her stay with him for a while. But now, a week later, Josh’s landlord says she can’t stay anymore. Josh is now telling me she’ll have to come back to us. He didn’t ask—he just told me she’d be back on Thursday.

My husband is furious. He thinks it’s ridiculous that Josh is dictating what we should do in our own space, especially when we’ve been driving him around because he doesn’t have a car. I told Josh that just because he’s older doesn’t mean he gets to boss us around when we’re already doing more than our share.

We talked as a family, and Mike said our sister is now me and Josh's problem. My dad can’t take her due to visa issues and health problems, and we don’t want to stress him out. I know she’s grieving, but that doesn’t excuse her behavior.

1gz47nj,"AITA for ""ruining"" the Holidays due to placing our mom in LTC?","So, I(28m) have two siblings Theo(35M) and Abby(38F). Our mother had a stroke back in 2019 and our father passed away in early 2021. I have been taking care of her since. I dropped out of my graduate program to take care of our mom. 

Since January things with our mom became more stressful, increased memory issues, lack of sleep, and I was generally burnt out. During this time my siblings did not offer any assistance. They have families and lives. It fell on me because at the time I was staying with our parents in their apartment in NY since  I was going to school in NY. 

Each year I would fly or drive to VA so our mom can see my siblings and her grandkids. I found a place for our mom back in February and I informed my siblings they had no objection at the time. Now that major Holidays are coming around they have been asking me if I am going to bring mom. I told them no I was not but if they wanted to take her they were 100% free to take her. I told them she is not in a prison and I did put them on the list for approved people to take her out. 

They told me they could not do that it would be far too complicated. I told them that is unfortunate but I am going on vacation so I would not be available. Now all of a sudden I have everyone and their mother reaching out to me telling me how selfish and heartless I am being towards our mother. 

I pretty much lashed out at Theo who is hosting this year and told him off. I told him he has no right to call me selfish. I was the one that stepped up to care for mom after her stroke and our dad passed. I handled the sleepless nights, the wandering, the outbursts, the doctors appointments. I handled getting her Medicaid, I handled everything and put my life on hold to do so. 

They got to see the pleasant side of our mom and if she had an outburst I was the one that had to deal with it. Them he said I should have asked for help. He claimed he figured I had it all handled and did not need help. 

I told him I should not have had to ask I was 23 when mom had her stroke and 25 when dad passed. You knew I was stressed and was handling everything. I told him he did not even offer to help me setup the arrangements for our dad's funeral. Neither did Abby. 

He said he cannot read minds, I should have asked. So in that moment I said fine and asked him can you come pick up mom so she can go over for Thanksgiving. I will cover the travel fare. He came up with excuses like it was short notice. I said fine what about Christmas and again came up with an excuse.

After that I told him this is why I did not ask because you fucks will always come up with an excuse to get out of it. I told him that is how you two have always been. 

Apologize for the borderline rant, I am just pissed atm.

Then there's the helping with homework, cooking, house chores, etc...

I said, sorry, but I was planning on having the day to myself.

They were a bit desapointed, and I felt a bit guilty.

1gnl02d,AITA For Telling My Mum I Won't Be Giving My Son Her Last Name,"Hi reddit, I'm a 21F who's expecting my first child with my partner of almost 8 years (20M). Our son is due in less than 2 months. For this story to make sense, it requires some backstory.

My father isn't in the picture, so my immediate family is me, my mother and my twin. About 3 years ago my maternal grandmother died. I didn't have a relationship with her and neither did my mum due to them always fighting. My grandma was quite wealthy and when she passed away she left me and my twin half a million total in a trust that we couldn't access until we were 25. She left my mother nothing.

My mother got a lawyer and got money released early from that trust  with the condition that me and my twin gave her half of our inheritance each. If we hadn't agreed to give her anything, she would of gotten NOTHING. Our mum then convinced us to put all the money into a trust of her own for our family exclusively for education and housing, saying it would build stability for future generations. I used this money to get a house that me and my partner currently live in.

Since my mum found out I was pregnant, she's been very pushy that we use her last name (which is currently my last name). It's a traditional Scottish name with a capital letter in the middle and a lot of use of the letters 'M' and 'N'. I dont like this last name, its hard to pronounce from just reading. I also fully intend to take my partners last name in the future. 

Three months ago I told her we wouldn't be using her last name and would be using just my partners last name. This set her off, calling me petty and ungrateful. I apologised for upsetting her and asked if we could have a conversation about it so I could understand why it upset her. I expressed that I love her and I don't want her to be upset. She refused, saying it was my child and I could do what I wanted. I assumed she had come to terms with it and moved on.

Fast forward to last week. I got a text from my mum saying the following:
""By the way, I've made changes to the trust. [Her last name] needs to be your child's surname if you want him to benefit from the trust. I haven't worked this hard for the future to support a [partners last name]. Thats just the way it is. My last name or bust. I'd rather take the lot and spend it.""

This upset me. I asked her to give me some time and space to think about what she's done. She then went off at me about how her hard work wouldn't be wasted (even though she herself said it would be set up for future generations like my kids). She wouldn't even have any money to blackmail me with if I hadn't agreed to give her half of my inheritance after her own mother screwed her over.

I have gone no contact. But I'm starting to wonder if I'm the asshole for not just using her name to keep her happy in order to make sure my son gets access to that money. I dont want him to miss out just because his grandmother is an entitled piece of work.

1gmu6xo,"AITA for not reacting properly to my friend group's ""Suprise AirBnB"" booking?","**\[Context\]** every year our friend group hosts a Secret Santa event. A major part of this tradition involves booking an Airbnb where most of us (around 12 people) plan to stay, though not everyone ends up sleeping there. Typically, we spend a few hours on Discord searching for Airbnbs that meet our criteria—location, capacity, budget, etc.—and bookmarking options for further review.

This year, our entire friend group followed the usual process, spending hours searching through listings and bookmarking potential choices to revisit later. Then, about two weeks ago, half of the group (let’s call them Group B) suddenly stopped communicating with us (Group A) and went completely silent on Discord for an entire week. This abrupt change left Group A confused, prompting us to ask questions about what was going on and why Group B had stopped communicating with us.

Suddenly, a few days later, Group B’s main planner—the person who typically leads our event coordination—announced that he had booked a “surprise” Airbnb that was within budget and located in a great area. While Group A appreciated the effort, we requested more details, wanting at least some basic information about the place. However, the planner refused to provide any specifics, repeatedly responding with ""trust me"" and informing us that each participant would need to contribute $60 (more details on that later).

As days passed, Group A grew increasingly confused and uneasy about this Airbnb, which we were expected to help pay for, without any assurance or photos of what we were actually funding. Then, a friend close to some members of Group B (we’ll call him “J”) let us know that the planner had recently purchased a house where everyone in Group B would be moving in. While we recognized this as an impressive feat for Group B, we were still confused by their continued insistence on presenting it as an Airbnb that we needed to contribute 60$/person toward.

With this information, Group A tried to get confirmation from Group B, but they wouldn't budge, even as the Secret Santa event came closer. J also told us that part of the so-called “surprise” was that we wouldn’t actually need to pay anything, since the planner owned the house.

Finally, last night, Group B revealed the truth: they had moved into a newly acquired house, and it would be the location for our Secret Santa event. Group A wasn’t thrilled about the week of lies and secrecy over something we had initially believed was an Airbnb we were expected to fund.

Group B is not happy with us, claiming that we acted essentially like babies for not being more supportive of their actions in getting this house for our event.

1gyaske,AITA for refusing to give my friend the money i made from reselling her concert ticket? ,"I (m22) and my best friend (f22) have been friends since we were in preschool. Recently, a popular female singer came to our city and we both wanted to go, so we looked into tickets to buy. She asked if her boyfriend could also come, which i had no issue with. I bought the tickets for the three of us, and they both sent me the money for their tickets.

A few days before the show, she was telling me about how her boyfriend really didn’t want to go to this concert, and how he felt uncomfortable watching a female performer in a leotard. She was telling me how he was not gonna interact (no cheering, clapping, etc.), and was refusing to split parking costs at the venue, even though we previously agreed to do so. I told my friend “if he doesn’t want to come, no one is forcing him”. I didn’t mean it to sound harsh, but if he is that uncomfortable with watching this performer, then why agree in the first place? Eventually, they decided both of them were not going to come to the concert anymore. 

I told them that is fine, but i would still be going by myself. They then asked for me to send them their money back, and i refused. Whether they choose to go or not, those tickets are already paid for, and if i send them the money back, i just paid for three tickets by myself. I told them I would transfer their tickets to them and if they wanted to resell them to make the money back, they could. They told me they did not want to put in the work to resell them, which I then offered that I could list them and if they sell, i will send the money back to them, but if they don’t, then they are out of luck. They agreed to this.

I ended up selling each ticket for about $65 more then i paid for them, and i sent back their money that they paid. Everyone was happy, and I enjoyed the concert. Recently, they found out that i actually made about $130 from their two tickets, and said it was unfair that i didn’t send them the extra money because they were their tickets, even though they got a full refund of what they initially paid. I told them that i did the work to sell them so i kept the additional money that I made from selling the tickets. They called me an asshole and now our mutual friends are saying I should’ve sent them all of the money I received. I think it is ridiculous and truthfully i don’t understand the big deal, the event has already passed and they received their money back. so AITA?
