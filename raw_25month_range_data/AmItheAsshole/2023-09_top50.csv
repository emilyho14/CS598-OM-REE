16ek8u3,AITA for telling my daughter that life doesn’t stop for others because hers isn’t going well?,"I have 3 kids, and my daughter (27F) hasn’t had the best luck in her romantic life. She’s gotten cheated on many times, and her previous relationship were unhealthy. I also believe shes in a toxic relationship with her current boyfriend.

My nieces and nephews, along with my other kids are all happily married, some starting their own families. 
 
It was my sisters birthday recently, and she and her husband had planned the trip for the family. She helped with expenses if needed but for the most part everyone payed for themselves.

My daughter was the only one going by herself.

We did things as family, but there were times when we split up to do something with just our partners. So sometimes my daughter was by herself or basically being a third wheel.

At the end of the trip my daughter complained to me how she hated going on the trip. That she felt like it was a cruel joke that she was there by herself, and that the others should not have show affection to their partners when she was around. This is not the first time she complained about something like this, she’s done it after holidays and birthdays as well. 

I’ll admit i’m tired of my daughter complaining about this. So I told her that just because her life isn’t going well doesn’t mean others will stop living theirs. She hasn’t talked to me since, and that was almost two weeks ago. My husband is on my side but i’m worried i’ll lose my daughter.

16qh017,AITA for 'belittling' my sister and saying she shouldn't demand her husband help with their baby at night?,"My husband and I (29M, 27M) went through the surrogacy process and had our son 4 months ago. We were thrilled when my sister (31F)  announced her pregnancy and we found out we would be having children very near the same time. Our niece was born a little over two months after our son.  
  
My situation and my sister's closely mirror each other. Our husbands both work typical 9 to 5s with 30 - 45 minute commutes. My sister is a SAHM and I do freelance work from home.   
  
For the first two weeks after our son was born (the first of which my husband took off of work), we would both take partial night shifts. Once I felt like I had at least some of my bearings on parenthood, I offered to take over completely on week nights, while he does mornings before work + weekends. It's a collaborative process and that breakdown of parenting just made sense to me. My husband was the one leaving our home to work every day, he was the one who had to be up by a specific time and make a drive.  
  
At 4 months, we no longer have this obstacle anymore (and to be honest, I kind of miss the sweet, quiet bonding time those extra night feeds provided now that he's settled onto a nice sleep schedule and usually only wakes up once.) Still, I think we got it down to almost the perfect science before we exited the newborn stage. My sister, on the other hand, is very much still in that phase and struggling.  
  
This has been a recurring problem for her from the beginning. She has been coming to me saying she's scared she's going to fall asleep holding the baby, that her husband won't help her with the night feeds, etc. I tried to give her tips since I've been through it. I suggested she let her partner take over in the evenings (\~6 to 9pm) so she can go to bed early and catch a few more hours, nap when baby naps, etc.. She shot down everything saying ' that wouldn't work for them' and that she just needed her partner to do some of the night feedings.   
  
I reminded her that her husband is the one commuting in the mornings and falling asleep while driving was a very real possibility, and that I had lived through it and so could she. I then offered to watch her daughter for a few days so she could catch up on sleep. She took major offense to both of these things. She said I was belittling her experience and acting like I was a better parent. She said I couldn't truly empathize with her or give her valuable tips since she had been pregnant and I hadn't, and that me offering to watch my niece just felt like me saying she needed help raising her own daughter.  
  
My intentions were definitely not malicious and I'd like some outside perspective here. AITA?

168h2xd,AITA for refusing to share my half of the inheritance money with my niblings?,"My sister (40f) and I (34m) recently lost our last remaining parent. We are both devastated, but regardless, the logistics all need to be worked out. Our parents were very clear in their will that our inheritance and all property are split evenly between the two of us. It’s to the tune of around $1 million. Here’s where the problems start. I’m gay, I live with my partner who I’m not married to across the country from the rest of my family. My sister and her husband have 3 small kids under 11. My sister said that since it’s highly unlikely I’ll ever have kids (which still remains to be seen, I haven’t decided that yet) and because I live a comfortable life currently, that I should take at least a quarter of my inheritance money and open bank accounts for her kids. Instead of using her own money to do that, she wants to buy a McMansion to get out of their smaller cramped house. Basically implying that her and her family need the money more than I do since they’re married with kids and I’m not. She thinks my parents were unfair when they created the will and that I should “do the right thing” to make up for their mistake. Our entire family is split on the issue. My BIL is obviously on my sister’s side and says I’m being greedy and don’t care about my niblings’ future. Our aunts and uncles and cousins all have differing opinions, with the more homophobic side of the family saying I’m being a greedy asshole. This is causing a major rift and I’m worried that eventually she’ll cut me off and wont let me have a relationship with the kids anymore. Part of me thinks maybe I should just let the money go.

16i10qu,AITA for turning around and going back to my parents with my baby when I got home because my husband let his homeless brother move in and everyone had lice.,"I recently went to see my parents with my newborn. It was just for the long weekend so my husband stayed home with our three older children. 7/5/3. 

My husband called me when I was out of town to let me know his brother needed a place to crash. I said that he should give him a ride to a shelter or something because it was a bad idea to let his brother in our home. He has stolen from us before. 

When I got home there were five very itchy people in the house. I immediately got back in my car and went to my parents house. My husband was calling me the whole time because he needed help dealing with the lice. I didn't call him back until the baby was settled back in at my folk's place. 

I told him the pharmacy had the shampoo and comb for lice. He said he needed me to come home and take care of it.  I noped. I said that he let his brother in our home against my wishes. His brother gave them all lice. I also reminded him that when our oldest got lice from kindergarten he didn't help me at all. 

I hate lice. They freak me out. I dealt with it because I had to.  This time it's on him. He said that he would have to use up his sick days to take care of this. I said tough shit. 

He did it. He took his brother to a shelter, he deloused himself and the kids, and then he spent three days cleaning all the bedding and the furniture. He called me every day begging for help. I did not come home until his mothe confirmed that everything was done. 

He is pissed that I stuck him with all that by himself. I know I should have helped but it was too much.  I'm still not 100% from the baby. It was just too much.",Weird_Theme_2795,16422,1311,0.949999988079071,0.6569683908045977,1694644178,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16i10qu/aita_for_turning_around_and_going_back_to_my/,2023,9
16gboda,AITA for telling my sister gender reveal parties are tacky and attention seeking,"My sister (25f) has always been a bit of an attention seeker. She would always announce her grades, new jobs, raises, etc. whenever the family was together. It killed me when she used to tell the entire family she got a 100 on her test in a class that we were taking together even though she knew I only got a C- or D+ and they would ask me how I did after her announcement. She was always the golden child and I (26f) was the screwup.

We're both pregnant right now, both of our first kids. She's married with a great job and a house and I'm on my own in a studio right now. A couple weeks ago I got an invitation to her gender reveal barbecue/pool party. I didn't want to deal with her showing off to the entire family in front of me so I told her I won't be coming. She asked why so I told her that I didn't want to deal with her friends and our family. She insisted it would be fun so I told her that gender reveal parties are tacky and I don't want to deal with it. 

She, again, insisted that it would be fun and just to think of it as a barbecue with colored cookies. I snapped at her that I didn't want to go to a stupid party to watch her show off to our family just like she did when we were younger. She hung up on me and now our parents are upset at me for being rude to her.

16rb5mt,AITA for insinuating a woman was fat?,"I (35F) am currently 8 months pregnant. Something I've learned (fun news for anyone aspiring to follow down that same path) is that a LOT of people, mostly older women, feel that if you get pregnant they suddenly have the right to both comment and touch your body without permission. Sometimes/often without warning- even total strangers. I'm an intrinsically private person and while I don't take offense, it does encourage the inner snark to come out. 

I started showing around 5/6 months. I have two fibroids that are each quite large, think softball size. This causes me to look bigger and further along than I am. I've also not really gained elsewise (yes I'm aware it's a good problem to have, but I do look disproportionate) so it's REALLY apparent even under hoodies. Fast forward to last weekend.

I was in our local grocery store and an older, larger woman walks up to me and says something akin to ""aw hunny, congrats! How far along are you?"". Kindly, sure, so I smile, step out of touching distance (this is usually when they go for a belly feel) and say ""8 months"". She looked at me with a shocked expression and exclaims ""Oh hun NO I would have guessed any day now! YOU'RE HUGE!!""

So... I smiled sweetly back at her and said ""aw thanks, you too"". 

You can imagine it didn't go over well. At one point she said something about it being medical, and so my one interjection was ""hey me too""- but it didn't do much to diffuse the situation. Eventually she huffed away and I carried on my business.

I don't really feel bad, but I am trying to gauge the assholiness of my response. I strongly feel that there shouldn't be a stigma that pregnant women suddenly become public property, but acknowledge I could have once again been the 'bigger person'. Or responded with ""yeah I have two tumors in there with her"" which has historically gotten a sputtering apology from people too. (Fibroids are benign tumors so this is technically true, just aimed at making people uncomfortable).",Silver-Butterfly-767,9799,2289,0.8999999761581421,0.5724158666465087,1695595268,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rb5mt/aita_for_insinuating_a_woman_was_fat/,2023,9
16jqw93,AITA for shutting down a girl’s attempt to diagnose me with an eating disorder?,"I lost my left leg when I was very young from a hospital acquired infection. I have a prosthetic leg which I use for walking and another one for running and exercise. When I was on my parents health insurance growing up I got refitted regularly as I grew up. Now I’m too old to be on my parents insurance and while my company’s insurance is considered very good, getting a new leg or getting adjustments for body weight changes are still expensive. I expect to be paying a fortune if I get pregnant. So I try my best to stay the same weight and if I gain some weight I can immediately feel it becoming less comfortable to walk in.


Anyway a friend’s gf and I were talking and she began remarking on how I’m not eating much. We were out to dinner and I just was having a soup and salad and everyone else was having baby back ribs. I’d stolen a few of my bf’s plate but generally I was trying to eat light. I said I was trying to lose a few pounds and she immediately assured me I was beautiful the way I was and I didn’t need to lose weight. I told her I know I am but losing weight helps with my mobility. She began “diagnosing” me with an eating disorder. Saying I must have a delusion I was very heavy and having issues walking. I was pissed and she sounded super condescending and blurted out she had no business talking down to me about my weight even if it was to tell me not to change it. The other people overheard and the gf got really embarrassed and left with my friend soon after. 

With long loose pants it’s often hard to tell I have a prosthetic leg. I don’t know if she knew but I didn’t feel like justifying why my weight needed to stay the same.

When my wife and I met my facial hair admittedly was patchy. But as the years have passed and I have aged my facial hair is now full and supple. I have always wanted to grow a nice long beard like the masculine men I saw growing up. I always admired it. Throughout my relationship with my wife I have normally kept just scruff on my face. But I have also told my wife about my desire to grow out my beard. Her reaction is always to tell me who that's gross or you need to shave you look disgusting.

16wk6vv,AITA for refusing to give up my airplane seat to a tall person?,"Hey everyone! Bit of a weird situation and I’m not sure if I am TA or not. Happy to have my perspective challenged.

Last week I was taking a 12 hour flight that I had booked months in advance. At the time of booking I paid extra to choose my seats. The seat I chose was $55 extra and right at the front of the plane (trying to arrive somewhere on time upon landing). The seat also happened to be an extra legroom seat and I am a 4’11 female.

I check in, board, sit in my seat as usual, but as soon as the seatbelt sign was switched off I had a man come over and ask to change seats. The first time he asked politely saying that he is 6’4 and flying is painful for him can we please change seats. I was open to it until I saw that his seat was way in the back of the plane and so I told him no sorry I paid extra to sit up front. He kind of got increasingly mad and wouldn’t leave saying that there’s no reason someone of my height needs extra legroom (I told him I paid to be upfront). I suggested that he ask the other people in those seats if they could swap but he refused saying that he wouldn’t want to bother other men or split up couples. He kept getting rude and angry so I just called over a flight attendant who told him to go sit down. For the rest of the flight he would walk past for no reason slamming into me (I was sitting aisle).

Was I in the wrong? Should I have swapped with him? TIA",Such-Error-34,5916,1857,0.949999988079071,0.402466177625473,1696113531,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wk6vv/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_airplane_seat_to/,2023,9
169bc2f,AITA for wearing scrubs even though I’m not a nurse,"Five years ago, when I was in high school, I got a job as a kennel technician at a pet store. when I got the job, I was told to go get a few pairs of scrubs, and that I need to wear scrubs to work every day. I helped people out around the store just like all of the other employees, but my main job was to help the vet take care of the puppies. Obviously, the vet did the heavy lifting and I was just there to assist. I don’t know for sure why I was required to wear scrubs when the most medical thing I did was give the dogs their medicine, and I’m pretty sure it was just so the kennel techs looked professional (the owner was a bit pretentious and was always concerned with appearing professional). 

Three years ago when I started college, I had to quit my job at the pet store. I was determined to pay my way through college and not take out any student loans, and as much as I loved that job, it did not pay very well. When I quit, I got rid of all of the shirt scrubs, but I kept the pants because as it turns out, nurses have been holding out on us, and scrubs are really comfortable. I treat them like sweatpants. They are comfortable and just something for me to wear around the house on my day off, but I would never go out in public wearing them.

Fast forward to two days ago, when I went out to go check the mail while wearing some of my old scrubs without thinking about it. Our neighbor who lives in front of the mailboxes was out watering her garden and she perked up when she saw me. She she got all excited and told me about how her daughter was a nurse, and how she knew I was in college but she didn’t know I was going to college to be a nurse. So I of course cut her off and said oh I’m actually in college getting a degree in history and I go on to explain why I had the scrubs and all that. To say she was mad about me wearing scrubs would be an understatement. She compared it to stolen valor, when people dress up like veterans and first responders when they aren’t. She went on and on about how hard her daughter worked to become a nurse, and that nurses “have earned the right to wear scrubs.” I was honestly a little baffled, because I wasn’t trying to pretend to be a nurse, and now, one of my neighbors who I barely know is lecturing me in the middle of our neighborhood. 

She posted on Facebook that afternoon that she saw someone out in public wearing scrubs, and that when she talked to them it turned out they weren’t even a nurse. It was very clear that she was talking about me, but I do appreciate that she said it was a stranger at a grocery store since she is friends with a lot of the people in our neighborhood. I didn’t even consider that I could be in the wrong until I saw how everyone who was commenting on her post was agreeing with her. So am I the asshole?",Capn_Frogger,10027,490,0.9700000286102295,0.36396026426562633,1693782475,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169bc2f/aita_for_wearing_scrubs_even_though_im_not_a_nurse/,2023,9
16bzzj6,"AITA for refusing to change the color of my sister's bridesmaid dress, even though she hates it?","I can't believe I'm posting about this but I really need some insight.

I (23f) am getting married to my fiancé (25m) in November. We're really excited and the day is fast approaching.

I have 5 women being my bridesmaids, one of them is my sister, Millie (21f). Millie has always been more of a tomboy growing up but doesn't have an issue with wearing dresses for formal events.

I want my bridesmaids to wear matching dresses, which everyone knew when they accepted. I bought and paid for the dresses. They're a relatively simple style and in a pastel pink color.

Millie is now angry and saying she won't wear the dress because it's pink and ""too girly"". She's even threatening to not attend the wedding anymore unless I return her dress and pick out another color.

I'm distraut that she'd make such a problem out of a dress color when she knew I wanted the bridesmaids to match. I think Millie is being dramatic and could deal with wearing the dress for one day but tbh my feelings are really hurt that she'd threaten to drop out of the wedding over this.

My fiancé thinks I should kick her out of the wedding party before she causes bigger problems closer to or on the day. My parents got themselves involved in this and told me to just exchange the dress for the same one in a different color and that we're both acting like children.

Our marriage fell apart when Mia was still in diapers. Sarah was having an affair with my younger brother and she became pregnant with my nephew, Caleb (M20).

Sarah and my brother ended up getting together, although eventually my brother abandoned them and packed his bags and moved to another state when  Caleb was around 2 and to this day never sees his son.

We had shared custody of Jamie and Mia but they gradually chose to spend more and more time at my home when they became teenagers, as they felt that their mom liked Caleb better than them.

Since lockdown, Sarah has changed a lot as a person. She ""rededicated her life to Christ"" and joined a very cult-like online church.

Recently, someone from his college outed Caleb as gay and Sarah has disowned him as her son, and ever so graciously gave him a week to get out of her house (sarcasm of course).

I reached out to Caleb and told him that he is welcome to stay with me for free so that he can finish college, there's no way I could watch a family member become homeless without trying to help them. After some talking things out he moved in, and I had him take Jamie's old bedroom. My kids haven't lived at home in a while now so I have the space, and it's actually quite nice to have Caleb's company.

The problem is that Jamie and Mia are both extremely upset with me for letting Caleb move in, considering their history with him and Sarah showing him favoritism. They say that there are other family members who could've taken him in (my parents offered but they do live in another country) and that I should've asked them beforehand to consider their feelings.

16ixm2q,AITA for not making an effort to increase my child support payments after coming into some money.,"I got divorced five years ago and I lost a lot. My ex got the apartment and out car. I was okay with it because she had our children and I wanted everything to be as stable as possible for them. I ended up moving in with my grandmother to make ends meet. 

My ex and I were doing a decent job of being co-parents I think. I spent a lot of time with my kids and I have never missed a child support payment. 

My grandmother became I'll during COVID and I was basically her caregiver. She made it through but it knocked her on her ass. She passed away about two months ago. 

I am an only child but my parents are both irresponsible which is why they couldn't help me out when I needed somewhere to live. 

My grandmother made me her main beneficiary when she passed away. All that she said was to take care of my kids. 

I sold her house after I gave everyone their bequests. I took the money and the rest of the estate and I bought myself a house and a car. Her house was old and not in a great neighborhood for kids. I also put money into my children's education fund. 

When my ex found out what I did she got upset. She said that I owed her more child support now. I checked with my lawyer before I did anything. Money from an inheritance, the sale a house, or a lottery win does not count as income. If I had invested the money instead then the interest would count as income.

16h5u91,AITA for using a fake test to expose my “colorblind” brother in front of friends and family?,"So, I (F17) have a brother (M15) who claims he’s colorblind. When he was younger, all his paintings and drawings seemed normal. The whole colorblind claim started after he turned 10, all because of a light pink t-shirt he perceived as white. My parents joked about him being colorblind since my uncle (my dad’s brother) is. He continued this claim, constantly mentioning it to others, which has always annoyed me because I’m sure he’s lying. I’ve told my parents, but they brush me off, saying I’m just jealous of the attention he gets.

Last week was my birthday. I had a gathering at home with about 25-30 people on the weekend. The topic of his supposed colorblindness came up again, with everyone asking him to identify colors. I, feeling frustrated, asked him to take an Ishihara test on the TV. He agreed after some hesitation. I went up to my room to grab my computer to plug to the TV. But instead of a genuine test, I used a fake Ishihara test, one that anyone could pass.

16qj1fi,AITA for saying that my cats health is more important to me than my 4 year old nephew?,"I promised my sister to look after my 4 year old nephew Alex while she goes out for a dinner. Anyway, I woke up that morning and noticed that my cat cheese wasn’t feeling well. He was refusing to eat or drink and being overall very lethargic, after a few hours of him not getting better, I decided to take him to the emergency vet so I immediately called my sister and told her that cheese isn’t doing well and I was gonna be taking him to the vet and that I’m very sorry but I won’t be able to look after Alex. 

She lost her marbles. She didn’t even ask what’s wrong with cheese, she instantly started blaming me for ruining her night and claiming that it’s prob nothing serious and saying that it ridiculous that I care more about a cat than my nephew… I told her that that wasn’t true but I wasn’t gonna leave cheese to suffer all day till the next morning, after going back and forth I told her that yes I do care about my cats health more than my nephew. My cat was a life of death situation, my sister could’ve called a baby sister or asked someone else to take over but my cat could’ve potentially died. 

I love cheese, it’s just me and him at my apartment so he’s a huge part of my life and not just a pet that can be replaced so I truly don’t think I did anything wrong.

My mum called a few days later and told me that I should apologize for saying I care more about cheese than my nephew but I refuse to do so unless I get an apology about how she talked about my cat.

I love being a grandpa. But I like taking my grandchildren out to the pool, or the park. I do play games at home with them as well. 

My wife says that she doesn't want to do the things we used to do any more.  She says she doesn't have the energy any more. I don't mind doing them on my own. For example this last winter she got to stay at the hotel, the chalet, and town while I went skiing. This summer she didn't want to come down to the Carribean to go scuba diving. I would have loved her company but she said she wanted to help with the grandkids more. I said I understood but I still wanted my vacation. So I went. 

When I got back she was upset with me. She said I was an asshole for taking a vacation without her. She could have come. I just wasn't interested in hanging around the city for an extra two weeks. She said that she felt like I abandoned her. I said I worked hard my life so I could enjoy it not to lay like a potato. She said her new hobbies might be sedentary but she enjoyed them.

16kkvpk,AITA for suggesting to cancel my stepkids’ trip to Paris and Kyoto?,"  
My husband has 2 kids from a previous 9f and 7m. The kids have been with my husband 100% of the time since my husband and his ex broke up. She has not been very involved in their lives since the youngest was just a year old. They do not have a relationship with their mom, however, her mother and grandmother do visit the kids, but not often. I’ve known the kids since they were 3 and 5.   


  
I’ve traveled a lot during my childhood and as an adult. It’s something that the kids are really interested in. I go on vacation multiple times a year and unfortunately, my husband and the kids could never travel with me outside the US. The kids need a letter of permission to travel abroad, which was hard for us to get since his ex never answered his emails.  


  
My family and I have been planning a trip to Paris and Kyoto to visit my maternal grandmother and paternal grandparents for Christmas and New Year. My entire family is going on this trip, my parents, in-laws, siblings, cousins, nieces, and nephews. We’ve been planning this trip for over 2 years and we finally bought our plane tickets after my son was born eight weeks ago. My husband’s ex has also signed the letter of permission, so everything is already in order for the trip.   


  
Last weekend my husband’s ex sent him an email regarding our trip. She basically asked if we could cancel our trip, so the kids could spend Christmas with their great-grandmother. Their great-grandmother is supposedly ill and they’re not sure if she’s going to be here next year.  
My husband immediately wanted to reject that idea, but I asked him to think about it.  


  
I think it might be good for the kids to stay behind with their grandma. They’ll get to see their great-grandma for maybe for the last and they’ll also see their mom. I know the kids are very excited to travel abroad, but do think this is more important than Paris or Kyoto. Both are just cities they won’t go anywhere and we can visit in summer. I told my husband all of this and he argued that we’d probably not get the money back we already spend. I told him that we bought business-class plane tickets and I know we’ll get that back.   


  
My husband just got angry and told me that we’re not going to discuss it anymore. My parents and siblings are on his side, but I feel like they’re only looking at the money. When I was a kid my parents also left my siblings and me in Kyoto with my grandparents to go on a trip. At the time I was also angry about it, but as an adult am very happy that I got to spend that time with my grandparents.   


  
I think this is also the case for the kids. They probably won’t be happy about it now, but will really appreciate it when they’re older. My husband disagreed with this and told me I was not looking at the kids’ situation and was angry when I again suggested canceling their trip.

16i1t09,AITA for defending my parents choice to take money for my sisters surgery out of her college fund?,"
I(17f) am a freshman in college, as is my sister Leah(18f). 

Our parents weren’t the best off growing up, but they always set aside money for us to go to college. 

Leah played soccer, and before her freshman year of high school our parents sat her down and told her that if she played, she needed to be careful because if she got hurt all the money to pay for it would come out of her college fund. Several schools in the league our high school is in are pretty good with a reputation for playing rough, and she isn’t the biggest person, so she knew there were risks involved. 

In our sophomore year she had a pretty bad non contact injury that ended up needing surgery and several months of physical therapy. All this money came out of what would be contributed to her fund, and I don’t know an exact number but all the appointments and stuff were at least several thousand. 

Now we’re both going to similarly priced schools, and she will need more loans than I do. In a group chat we’re both in I made a joke about how expensive college is and she responded “now imagine paying thousands more because your parents don’t want to pay for your medical bills”. 

I privately messaged her and told her I didn’t think she should be sharing personal stuff like that and that she knew the risks of soccer and chose to play anyway. She said that she was free to share something that really upset her and that I needed to stick up for her against our parents(she’s argued about this many times). She said that they paid for my medical bills so they should for hers and that I was a “shitty sister” and is asking for me to tell our parents they should’ve paid. I don’t think I should have to, they clearly outlined what they would and wouldn’t pay for and the risks she chose to take aren’t my problem.

I (28f) am currently living with my sister (32f) and my niece who is 5 months old. My sister asked me to move in with her as she was separating from her partner and needed someone to help with the bills. I cover the majority of rent payments for the house and bills since my sister is not fully back to work yet. On the days she is working it is usually our mother who looks after my niece.

Now I mainly work from home and due to how loud both my niece and my sister are and the job specifics I wear good noise cancelling headphones (I also have a room with my own bathroom). I have told my sister multiple times if she needs anything and I haven't responded to a knock she needs to come into my room and tap me to get my attention otherwise I would simply won't hear her and wouldn't know if she needs anything. However my sister keeps forgetting it.

Last Friday was very hectic at my work so I ended up working 12 hours and had some snacks to get me going. I had no knowledge of my sister asking anything of me since I sit opposite the door I also haven't seen her coming into my room since she didn't tap me on my shoulder as we agreed. Apparently she had to run a few errands at work and had noone to leave my niece with and decided to leave her with me since she would be a few hours. Because I had no idea of her plans and she hasn't followed what I have asked her to do, my niece was left unattended for over 3 hours and was crying her eyes out for god knows how long. I only found out about it when my sister returned home (I was still working and had my headphones on) as she ripped the headphones off my head and started shouting at me and calling me an asshole for not attending to my niece, even I have explained to her I had no idea she was gone or my niece was crying (to add, I don't look at my phone during work hours and after I have checked there was no messages or missed calls from my sister)

16h6lbq,AITA for telling my sister it's her own fault our family doesn't help her with her kids?,"I (f21) have a sister Chloe (f32). Chloe has three kids, f8, f6 and m1. She and her husband both work and the youngest goes to daycare. Ever since the youngest has been born, my sister has had a bit of a personality shift. Getting more into organic food and ""holistic living"" as she calls it.

Chloe and her husband started leaving the kids with our parents for the whole weekend, every weekend, so that they can get a break. My parents are doting grandparents and seemed to enjoy it but around a month ago they refused to do it anymore, their reason being that they are too tired to keep up with the kids.

They then started leaving the kids with my other sister Avery (f27) every weekend. This had a similar ending.

After Avery started refusing, Chloe asked me if I could babysit the kids on the weekends. I stupidly told her yes. I only babysat for 3 Saturdays and had to call it quits because Chloe was driving me nuts.

First of all, she has a very very long list of rules for the kids while they're babysat. Some aren't so difficult to follow, like organic foods only (which is only what Chloe has in her house anyway), but others just feel silly, like no holding the baby for 'too long' and no shows or movies from Disney. There are more but this sub has a character limit.

When I was babysitting, Chloe would be calling me every 30 minutes, and she gets angry if I don't answer straight away. Every time Chloe came home, she would berate me over something, anything. Not answering the phone quick enough, letting the baby nap too long, etc.

When I told Chloe I'd no longer babysit, she got upset and said no one ever wants to help her anymore and her village is disappearing. I couldn't really pretend and I told Chloe it's her own fault, and people would be more willing to help her if she wasn't a helicopter parent.

She also lives primarily with my dad while I spend friday night to monday morning at his house and around 3-5 weeks during school break.

Now my paternal family is really outdoorsie, we like to do a bunch of things around that Sam is included and we just ignore each other during them while enjoying our time with others, however, my dad, grandad, aunt and I have a special treasure hunt we do around Christmas that it's really special to me. It's like the only real time I have with my dad because, while Sam is not as bitchy as some I've read here, she really likes to demand both my grandad and dad's attention and since they consider me ''tomboy-ish'' they kinda ignore me to coddle her which sucks.

My dad asked me around my 10th  birthday if he could invite Sam and I said no. I've been saying no ever since and while he doesn't like it, he respects it, he does other stuff with her without me and I don't complain. This year, however, Sam is very adamant on going and I just don't want to, my dad is pressuring me to let her come as well as Dora,  while my aunt and grandma are insisting he just leaves this thing untouched between us but my dad doesn't want to hurt ''his little girl's feelings''.

168g7uk,AITA(23F) for telling my siblings that we have to practice saving food for everyone else.,"My mom passed away 2 months ago, and my fiancé and I quickly became the sole guardian of my 3 youngest siblings(16, 14, and 11). As much as I loved my mom, I know how hard it was growing up under her and how we didn’t have a lot, so when I left for college I did feel guilty leaving my siblings there knowing they wouldn’t have much, but I did so for this very reason, so that I could make enough money to get house that allowed me to house all of them if needed. They understood why I had chosen to go away to college and didn’t resent me for leaving them there, which I’m so grateful for. 

Although i am in the position where my siblings can stay with me for however long they need to, I won’t lie and say things haven’t been hard. Especially financially wise, I mean I went from just caring for myself, my fiancé, and our 2 dogs to caring, clothing, housing, and feeding 3 children who need stability. It was such a shocking flip to my world and I’m just trying my best to do what’s best for my siblings. However one thing 3 teenagers can do is eat. And I fully understand that we grew up in a household where we would have food one week and then be home dry the next two weeks, so we truly never knew when we’d eat a full meal again outside of school. Yet that is not a worry my siblings have had to face here, it takes some saving and budgeting but my fiancé and I have come up with a way where we can spend $1,400 a month to fully stock up the house. I have had small conversations about my siblings needing to be considerate of everyone in the house when it’s regarding food and telling them to just take what makes them full and leave enough for others to be full as well. I understand the resources guarding mindset is very hard to get out of, I really do, but what else can I do? Things got bad when my fiancé and I went grocery shopping at Costco on Thursday, and we usually buy a few snacks for the kids to snack on or take to school. We woke up Friday morning and within less than 24 hours all of the chocolate chip cookies were gone and it came in a pack of like 50. 

I called everyone down and explained to them that I will never restrict access to ANY food from them, however they needed to be 100 percent considerate of everyone else in the house who also needed to have access to the same food and snacks as them. I told them that we were going to start learning about portion control and saving food for others and they all said that they understood and that was sort of the gist of it all. 

The reason I’m asking if I’m TA because I went to my group for other people who have the same situation as me and talked about it, and another group member told me that I was being a terrible person by controlling what they ate, and that I was going to give them an ED.

We met 3 years ago when she moved to the UK to get a professional qualification that took 2 years, then she worked in the UK for a year before we both moved to the US together. I had never met her parents in person before moving here, but I had met her older sister Jane (29f) and I know that they both had spoken to their parents about me. 

I’m Scottish, have lived there for my whole life, as have my parents, grandparents, great grandparents etc. what I’m saying is my family are on record here since the Scottish census began in 1801, and know my family line goes back several hundred years before that. It doesn’t really come up other than when Americans tell me they’re Scottish, which doesn’t normally bother me. Yet when we were at Emma’s parents’ last weekend for a family gathering members of the extended family kept coming up to me and telling me how happy they were that Emma is back from England and how they thought it was interesting I’m English which was confusing because Emma studied not far from my village in Scotland, and I’m not English. I politely corrected them and they all looked confused but changed the subject. After the 10th person — that’s not an exaggeration— I talked to Emma about it and she was just as confused as I was.

About an hour later and after several more instances I was in the kitchen with Emma when her mum (54f) came storming in and asked what I’d been telling people, I was confused bc I had talked to lots of people about lots of things. Then when she clarified I told her that I’ve been telling them I’m not English bc I’m not, and that Emma studied in Scotland bc she did. She went off saying how England is just what they call the UK and it’s the same. I told her that it’s not the same. She said I was letting politics get in the way. I told her that regardless of politics it’s still not the same bc England and Scotland are 2 separate countries and I want her to stop telling people I’m English, and to say Scottish or British instead. Emma agreed with me and we told her that we know she didn’t mean offence, but it is confusing and a tiny bit offensive. Bizarrely, she then said that she was referring to the continent and accused me of trying to make her seem stupid when I pointed out that would make me European. She talked to neither of us the rest of the night, neither Jane when she agreed with us.

Somehow since then it’s ended up being Emma, Jane and I vs their parents and everyone else since then and I kind of regret saying anything.

16uvx4g,AITA for not wanting to sleep in the same bed as my girlfriend's body pillow?,"I (25m) have a girlfriend (26f) who's autistic. Normally I wouldn't bring this up, but it is relevant to this story. She's pretty high functioning, but the main way her autism effects her is a really strong special interest in one specific fictional character. I've never had an issue with this, and I try to keep up with whatever's going on in the fandom for her and listen to her infodumping about her favorite character on a regular basis. 

About a year ago, my girlfriend got a body pillow of her favorite character. I didn't really have an issue with it, as we have a very large bed with more than enough room for something like a body pillow. The body pillow wasn't even that weird as far as body pillows go, it's just her favorite character wearing her normal outfit on one side and a simple dress on the other. Definitely not weird compared to other kinds of body pillows out there. 

Recently, my girlfriend told me she's getting more covers and another pillow inner so she can have two body pillows to sleep with at once. I was more apprehensive about this, as our bed is big, but two five feet long pillows plus two people feels like it would be pushing it. She assured me that if it was really an issue, she could go back to only sleeping with one, or alternatively lay one of them Lincoln style and use it as a regular pillow, so I agreed to it once again. 

The real issue arouse when the pillow covers actually arrived yesterday. She did get another cover of her favorite character, as I'd expected, but what I hadn't was that she'd also gotten a cover featuring her favorite character's DAD. I'd always known she had a little crush on him but I never thought it would go THAT far. Worse, this pillow isn't just him in a normal outfit like her original one. One of the sides full on has his dick and balls out for the world to see. 

I told my girlfriend that I'm putting my foot down, and I refuse to sleep in a bed with another man, even if that man is a pillow. She said that that's ridiculous, it's not like he's real, and one of the sides is SFW so if I'm really uncomfortable she can just keep it flipped to that side. 

I said that I still don't feel comfortable with that. I know I wouldn't be able to forget the uncomfortably detailed dick lying in wait on the other side of the pillow, especially if I have to sleep right next to it. She said she can put the pillow with her favorite character (who's female) between us, and keep the dad pillow firmly on her side of the bed, but I said I just don't want him in my bed at all. 

She's pretty pissed about it. Her body pillows are pretty expensive, since she has to get the art custom drawn and then custom printed, and it's not something you can return. The dad character really doesn't have any superfans other than her, so it's not like there's some other girl she can possibly try to sell him to either. I know she's been saving for this pillow a long time, so I do feel guilty saying she can't cuddle with it. AITA?

The mother hadn’t been in the picture in years, big time drug user and lost all her kids. I was a single mother with three kids. One of the things (There were many things but this really got me as my kids are the most import thing in my life) that I found appealing was that he was legally raising and loving another man’s child as his own! The first few years together were great, some minor disagreements with parenting, like him calling my 3 and 4yr olds sissies because they needed a night light to sleep. 

Blending families always has learning curves I thought, best to discuss with him and we can iron out a mutual parenting plan. It seemed to work for a few years.

We had all been living as one family for about five years. He proposed, 3 months after our wedding things started to change. Little things at first, comments that weren’t mean just mostly sarcastic Then it turned into yelling if a chore wasn’t done to his exact standards.

Each kid had 1 chore a day. I was not okay with this yelling and bickering that occurred daily, once again we talked but he wasn’t receptive and got very defensive  “You let the kids get away with everything and they have no consequences.” I’m a firm believer in not double punishing kids. So if a chore wasn’t done correctly I would tell to remember next time that this is also part of your chore. For example if one was taking the trash out but didn’t put a new trash bag in the trash can, it’s not defiance it’s a typical kid’s forgetfulness. To clarify all five of the kids had this issue. 

He started harping on the kids more and his kids point blank refused to do their chore. This went on for 2weeks, he didn’t say anything. So I brought it up and his response blew me away. He said “Your kids can do my kid’s chores for awhile seeing as how yours don’t know how to do chores correctly and mykids need a break”  

After that, It was he was yelling at my three for everything and it said it my kid’s fault that his didn’t do their chores. We both worked 40 hours a week, I handled the bulk of the household chores with the kids having small tasks like trash, putting the dishes away, folding clothes, sweeping, feeding the dogs and I rotated the chores every week so each kid didn’t get stuck with the same chore. 

Tired of only me and my kids cleaning up the house we all lived in, I decided to give those that did their chores a reward of extra screen time. His kids-still not doing chores- complained about not getting the extra screen time. He bought his kids each a tablet after denying my kid a tablet for her 12th bday. I put parenting software on the tablets and only allowed them time if their chores were done. He said I was an asshole and I had no right to stop them using what he bought them. Is he right and I’m the asshole?",EnvironmentalRoll317,2814,868,0.9399999976158142,0.18960495242574793,1694303227,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16eks1y/aita_my_husband_treats_my_kids_horribly_compared/,2023,9
16byu49,AITA for taking money out of my son’s allowance?,"
I(41F) have 3 sons(twins who are 12, and a 10 year old). All of my sons started doing chores around 8 and started getting allowances for their chores at 10 years old. Chores are only mandatory 5 days out of the week, I don’t care what time a day they choose to get them done. As long as they are done by the end of the day. I made it clear to my boys once they started earning money that they would be getting 10 dollars a day for everyday they complete their chore. If they fail to do so, then 10 dollars would be deducted. It has been that way for 2 years for my eldest boys and a couple of months for youngest. Allowance is always paid out every Wednesday, and I encourage them to save enough to take with them on the weekend to their dads in case they go somewhere fun or see something cool that they might want but dad might not be okay with spending money on. This system has worked swimmingly for us since it started, the boys have always complied with completing their chores.

However, one of my 12 year olds refused to do his chore of the week (sweeping down stairs and wiping down surfaces) for 3 days. The first 2 days he did so without problem, but when his friend asked him to play on Fortnite with him, my son asked for 15 minutes to complete his chore before he got onto the PlayStation. His friend asked what chore he had to do, so my son told him. In response, my son’s friend said “it’s a good thing my parents don’t make me do girl chores.” I spoke with my son and explained to him that knowing how to clean was not specific to any gender, that it was a life skill everyone needed to know. I also told him that I understood that other family’s functioned differently; however, in our family, everyone did an equal share. Even after speaking with him the first day he decided to not do his chore, he still chose not to do his chores, so like agreed I took 10 dollars out of his allowance for each day he didn’t do, which allotted to him only having 20 dollars in his allowance; whereas his brothers had 50. 

The problem comes where my son was so upset about the lack of money in his allowance that he called his dad about it very upset. My ex husband then proceeded to call me and tell me that I’m in the wrong for only giving him $20 and to imagine how it makes him feel that his brothers got more than he did. I explained to him that our other sons actually did their chores for all 5 days, so they were rewarded accordingly. And assured him that if he had decided to start giving the boys an allowance then he can run allowance however he wanted, but this was ultimately the system I had come up with. My ex husband told me that I am being insensitive and humiliating our son.

The mom said turn the lights off and tell them to go nighty night. my fiancé responded to the message saying we thought you would be back at 10. What’s the ETA? My sister responded asking if I was irate to which my fiancé said we both have an early morning in the morning. When the two moms got home They were very not remorseful for being two hours late and then not apologize or say anything about the fact there are two hours late. i went to the kitchen to grab my keys, one Mom asked if the kids went down all right I replied Yep and walked outside. my sister texted me apologizing, and I said we both  (me and my fiancé ) felt very disappointed and taken advantage of. I then said you can Venmo us. My sister, said wow, really.

16csnas,AITA for yelling at my husband for asking the temperature of the soup,"My husband and I just got back from a trip where I contracted a nasty bacterial infection in my chest and my sinuses. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that sick before, I’m still sick but no longer feel like I’m dying. Yesterday in the morning I made my famous Get Better Soon Soup that I only make when someone in the family or friends circle is sick. Chopping and slicing and general cooking stuff wiped me the F out, but it was so worth it. Husband was at work and I wanted soup, no big deal. We often bring his mom food since she lives nearby and we like to help/spend time with her. When my husband came home to me laying on the couch much like a dead fish lays on the beach, he declared the soup smelled amazing and then asked me to put some in to go containers for him and his mom to eat. I just looked at him and very slowly and very quietly said, “I’m still really sick, and I’m the one who had to make the soup, it really took a lot out of me, can you Please do it yourself.” I did not succeed in keeping the annoyance out of my voice. He said yes, also a little annoyed. And as he approached the stove he asked “do you think it’s hot enough for us to eat right away, or will I have to heat it up when I get there?”. And then I lost it. I yelled, I couldn’t help myself, I was so annoyed and shocked at his first question, I really couldn’t handle how incredibly incompetent this new question was. I said “Give me a break, please lord you have to be kidding me. You are a grown man, with hands, and a brain. You cannot be asking me about the temperature of something you’re standing over. Tell me you’re fucking with me.” He was standing there shocked and a little hurt, I felt bad, but not that bad! All he had to do was ladle the soup into the to go containers, he’d be able to feel the heat through the container. Or he could have tried it. Or he could have done literally anything other than ask me that question. Stick your wingwang in there for all I care! He really didn’t say much, just packed up the soups, and left. Everything is fine, he seems to have chalked it up to ‘she’s sick and in a bad mood’ and has forgotten about it. I did not apologize, nor has he asked nor seemed like he needed one.

My youngest 2 are teenagers aged 16 and 14, and my nephew is 8. My in-laws also live with us. We have a 6-bedroom house so each of the kids have a bedroom, my wife and I have a bedroom, my in-laws have a bedroom, and we previously had a spare bedroom for my older children to stay in when they visit.

My oldest daughter moved to my home country at 18 to attend university there. She met and later married her husband, and they have an almost 4-year-old son together. Things went south in their relationship a few months ago. My daughter moved out with their son, and she was able to stay with my brother for the last few months. 

A couple weeks ago she was able to leave the country to move back home with us. My 16-year-old daughter moved into the spare bedroom so we could turn her bedroom (that is bigger and has its own bathroom) into a room for my daughter and grandson to share. 

The whole family pitched in to decorate to my daughter's taste and to create a nice area for her son with a small loft bed. 

When she came, she was initially grateful, but she did express not being too fond of sharing a room with her son. 

Last week she suggested that my nephew and grandson could share a room instead. I told her if she was staying in my home it would have to be in a shared room with her son. She mentioned it a few more times so I asked my nephew if he would like to share his room. His answer was that he didn't really want to, but said some nights grandson could have a sleepover in his room.

She thinks I'm not being nice to our daughter who is going through a tough time right now and might need some space/privacy to adjust to her whole life/future changing.

16jsx4z,AITA for telling my sister her daughter's eating habits are out of control and need addressing?,"I am 30F. I'm raising my two kids, 7F and 4M. I have a younger sister, Megan, 28F. Megan has a daughter, Ava, 5F.

My daughter Ruby turned 7 last week and she wanted a laser tag party. I planned her a birthday party at our nearest laser tag centre, and I allowed Ruby to invite two friends from school. It includes a few games of laser tag and a pizza dinner afterwards for the kids.

Both of Ruby's friends are vegetarians but luckily the laser tag place has plain cheese pizza that they can have.

I invited a few family members as well, including Megan and her daughter. Megan declined, her reasoning being that Ava will not eat pizza and she'll feel left out.

For context

Ava has been a picky eater for a while. Whether this is due to neurodivergence or not, my guess is as good as anyone's because my sister has never taken her to a pediatrician about this (we live in a country with free healthcare, cost is not the issue). Megan just caves and plays restaurant with her all the time and never has her try anything new.

According to Megan, the only things Ava will eat are chicken nuggets, plain cheese sandwiches, mashed potatoes and waffles. Megan just acts like this is not unusual or a problem at all, and says Ava will grow out of it eventually.

The problem started because Megan suggested that we change plans and after the laser tag games, we take all the kids to McDonald's. I told Megan about two of the kids at the party being vegetarians and that she's more than welcome to bring her own food to the party for Ava.

Megan kept trying to persuade me and said Ruby's friends can bring their own food instead. I told her to stop because I'm not changing the plans, she can either come or not, at this point I was getting annoyed. Megan snapped at me and said the girls are choosing to be vegetarians, her daughter isn't choosing to be a picky eater, and I should prioritise my niece. I said it's not about priorities, I'm just not changing plans that are already made and booked. I told Megan she needs to address her daughter's eating habits because they are blatantly out of control.

My sister said there was no need for me to be rude and that I have no right to comment on her parenting, Ava isn't my child and I have no say. She said if I have a problem with that, I can go screw myself.

Megan ended up not going to the party and my parents are intervening and saying that they understand why I said what I said, but it's still not my business and I should've just left it at ""I'm not changing the plans"" and I should apologize to Megan for the comment.

I (23F) have a sister ""Janine"" (26F). Janine is married to her husband (41M) and they have an 18-month-old son together

Since I was a teenager I've always been a private person. I don't do social media, at work I don't talk about my personal life and I only talk about work-related stuff. When I'm with family I don't discuss my work life. 

Because I'm a private person my family has no idea what I do for work, what my salary is and they also have no idea what university I went to or what degree I picked. 

I'm just going to give a tiny bit of context of my family life. When I was 15/16 my mother, a single parent, started getting sick and I became her carer. By the time I was 17, she couldn't do anything other than stay in bed. By the time I was 18, my mother had passed away. I'm not going to lie it was a struggle because I was doing my GCSEs and A-levels and managed to just pass them. I explained my extenuating circumstances to my five choices of universities and all five accepted me. 

Since my nephew was born my sister has become obsessed with taking pictures of her son every single day and is constantly sending them to me. I don't have any insecurities about my body but I just like leading a private life and I haven't taken a picture in five years. 

Every time I come around to see my sister, BIL and nephew, my sister is constantly trying to take pictures of us together and has only managed to successfully take two. Whenever my sister has her phone in her hand or is near her phone I will step away from my nephew as I know she wants to take a picture.

Something came up yesterday and I asked her if she could take Liam and I'd be like 20 minutes late. She could leave or wait in the waiting room when I arrived. She said okay. 

When I arrived, neither my son nor my ex was there. I asked the front desk if they ever came and she looked confused. She said Liam came in with his dad and they were waiting for the doctor. I said, well I'm the dad. I asked if she meant my son's stepdad Chris. She said that makes sense and explained a lot (they look nothing alike).

They told me to go to exam room 5 and the doctor was having my son do some squating thing and sure enough, there was Chris. 

I whispered to Chris thanks for dropping Liam off and then there was there super cringe awkward moment when the doctor asked my son to pull down his underwear in front of us. My son's drawstring wouldn't untie and Chris instinctively tried to untie it but couldn't. So he just pulled his pants and my son almost fell down and Chris looked at me and shrugged and joked ""well it's not anything I haven't seen. I've been his stepdad for awhile.

I didn't think to mention this to anyone for a number of reasons 1. As I just side, medicine side effects vary depending on what it is, and commercials and scripts usually overstate them. 2. What am I going to say to her before the wedding, that I'm taking his medication and it might have side effects in general? I've never struggled with incontinence or IBS or anything like that in the past.  
  
It's a little while before the ceremony is about to start, and I'm being pulled into a million directions helping out, and I start to feel a bit of a stomach ache, and then we all get shuffled up to the front without warning. Whatever, I'm at the wedding, I can't go run out for tums, it will be fine. Pachelbel starts playing, everything is in place. 

  
All of a sudden, I feel a deep pain in my bowels. For twenty seconds I'm just standing there thinking, do I have to go, what do I do, just, idk, trying to process the situation while remaining composed. It happens. I'm not going to go into detail here because it was embarrassing and traumatizing, needless to say I excused myself. 

  
After dealing with the whole situation, I was there standing outside the bathroom not sure what to do next. I had assumed the ceremony had continued to go on, do I go back? There's no way. They're in the middle of their vows, and here comes shit girl. So I waited a while as to not interrupt anything.  
  
Two of the other bridesmaids found me crying eventually and told me that Sarah was upset and said I should leave, so I did, in shame. It all happened over the weekend, and its now Tuesday night. I had sent an apology text to Sarah, but I haven't heard anything from her or anyone else in the wedding party. Am I the asshole for ruining the wedding and not letting my friend know about my medication?  
AITA?  
  
TLDR: Had an accident at a wedding in the wedding party, was told to leave, and did. Now my friends wont talk to me. Should I have said something beforehand about the meds I was taking? That's the only way I see having prevented this.

16s5q4a,AITA for lying to my son about the reason our cat wasn't there anymore?,"I (52F) have a son who I will call Asher (18M), and a couple years ago we had a cat named Luna who was our family's pet for 19 years. Around 2 years ago, my husband passed away in his sleep from a heart attack related to complications from his Diabetes.  
  
After my husband's death, Asher went off the rails. Accused me of trying to get rid of my husband. Accused me of cheating. Accusing me of wanting to get rid of our cat. Even threatened to get rid of my late mother's ashes. He ended up having to get hospitalized where the doctors told me he had schizophrenia, and I was advised to rehome our cat by several family members. So I contacted a close family friend and asked her if she was willing to take in the cat, which she took in the cat while my son was in the hospital.  
  
When my son got home, I told him that Luna had gotten very sick and stopped eating while he was gone, and the vet decided she had to be put down. It took him a while, but eventually he accepted it as the truth and mourned the loss of his cat. I felt so bad lying to him like that, but I was worried if he knew the cat was still around, he would have a worse outcome.  
  
Recently, while at a family dinner, one of my nieces told him that Luna was still alive and told him where she was at. Asher ended up confirming that what happened was the truth, and went off on me. Yelled at me for lying to me, for daring to get rid of Luna. I told him I didn't feel like she was safe here and that multiple family members advised me to rehome her. He wasn't having it, and has since stayed shut in his room for a week. He only begrudgingly comes out for dinner, where he yells at me and calls me a terrible mother, and drags his food back to his room.  
  
Am I wrong here? Did I do something bad by not being honest to him? Was I wrong for getting rid of Luna? These questions keep me awake for hours on end sometimes, and now more than ever do these questions haunt my mind.",Few_Temperature_7624,1706,361,0.9200000166893005,0.09516569621351789,1695680061,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16s5q4a/aita_for_lying_to_my_son_about_the_reason_our_cat/,2023,9
16i1g5p,AITA for taking my son away from my husband?,"I (38F) am married to my husband, Mark (40M). My husband is christian and I'm atheist. Earlier before our marriage, our relationship was tough because his family didn't approve of me being atheist and wanted me to convert to Christianity but I refused. Eventually they came to respect my decision and though I'm not best friends with them, we maintain civility.

When me and Mark had our son, Jay (9M) his family sprung into the picture wanting to baptize him because he was a ""Christian"" baby. I respectfully declined and this caused a lot of tension between me and the family. I made it clear that my son was not to be indoctrinated and that he'll find his way to Christianity if he wants to. Me and Mark agreed on this even though his family didn't like it. 

Just yesterday, we were going to sleep and I went to check on Jay and to my surprise, I find him kneeling and praying. I thought it was cute and watched him until he noticed me. What really shocked me was him instantly stopping, looking freaked out. He then started apologizing and asking that I don't punish him. I was so confused and asked why I would do that, only to find out from him that my husband has been secretly indoctrinating him into Christianity, which happened during times I was not around or when they went to my in laws. Mark told him to keep all this between themselves because ""I've been affected by an unholy spirit, which would make me severely punish him if I found out he was christian"".

I felt sick after hearing about all this and I told him to keep this conversation between us and that he can pray any time he wants to. I ended up sleeping in his room, disgusted with the thought of being next to Mark. Today after Jay went to school, I confronted Mark about all of this and at first he tried spinning this as if Jay was the one who wanted to be christian but eventually admitted it, justifying it with that his family pressurized him and that it's the ""correct"" way to live. I ended the conversation and we both went to work. After work, I took Jay and packed some of our stuff then headed to my father's house before Mark came back. I plan on staying there until me, Mark and his family have a long overdue conversation and to determine whether this marriage is still worth it. I really can't believe any of this is happening. I feel stupid for not seeing this would happen eventually. However my decision feels rash and that I shouldn't keep Jay away from his father because he has no idea what's going on.

16i1uhe,AITA Husband's side of the family is pressuring us to give them a Greencard,"My husband's family is Ukrainian living in Russiaand Italy at the moment

We have invited his dad to visit us in Washington, and while during the week that he stayed with us he managed to throw a huge temper tantrum because he demanded that we apply for a Greencard for him right away. We agreed, but told him we needed to find out more about the process and how he will support his family of 5. He has 3 young kids 17, 13, 11.  He was not satisfied with that and yelled at us about how we are betraying the family and not moving him to the US.

He is a wealthy business owner in Belarus and Russia, and when we asked for him to bring the family for a vacation to the states, he refused. My only condition was to meet the family and talk about moving to the US and all the financial decision involved. He has refused to come and visit us. 

He is now living part time in Italy and part time in Russia and constantly berates my husband and I about how we are betraying him. This is causing me so much stress and anger that I can't sleep for nights at a time.

167n3n4,AITA for telling my wife that I didn't care about her feelings?,"sockpuppet account for obvious reasons.

my wife and I are in our mid-30s. We've been together since 2014, married since 2019. No kids. 

about ~4 times per year, my wife has what I can only describe as a rage attack. She has an (untreated) disorder that causes her emotional regulation issues, and she sees a therapist (though not a psychiatrist). They are very frustrating to me. She is functionally ""unreachable"" as she goes through them, and she just... gets mad. At me, obviously, but just everything in her life, no matter if it makes sense or not. It's like her amygdala just freaks the fuck out at a tiny thing (mild conflicting opinion from me, or not being able to find her phone, etc) and pumps out anger hormones. 

she returns to a baseline afterwards, apologizes earnestly and honestly, and returns to her normal self. Her normal self has big emotions too, but I almost enjoy them - I don't feel emotions as deeply as her, so it's nice to feel along with her, if that makes sense. 

three nights ago, she had one. We had a little disagreement, so I went into the kitchen, and she threw something at the wall and started just *yelling*. She wouldn't let me leave the kitchen. Again there is no reasoning with her when this happens, words mean nothing. 

I escaped, told her to go to bed, cleaned up the mess she made, and that was ""that"".

The next day, she came home from work and started apologizing, and I told her that I wasn't really willing for this to happen again, and she has to take action to prevent this from happening. We kept talking and a couple minutes later she said, ""I feel really bad, you know"" and my response was **""right now, I don't care how you feel. I'm telling you this can't keep going on.""**
we dropped it and moved on.

a couple hours ago, she brought up that it was hurtful that I told her I didn't care about her feelings, but I think that's a pretty reasonable way to respond when I was on the floor of our condo cleaning up her rage choices the night before.

16ix6hb,AITA Older woman is trying to “mother” my bf and ice me out. I think she’s overbearing and I need some boundaries.,"TL/DR: My (25F) boyfriend (25M) has a family friend (50sF) who sleeps in his bed, walks around in her bra, and watches us cuddle. His mother just passed. Now 50sF says she considers herself his “mother” and is trying to ice me out. AITA?

We’ve been dating for 1y +. Three months in, his mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He had to move home several states away. I moved out (at his request) for 3 months (got my own place). His mom and I got along amazingly, she even left family jewelry to me in her will. 

He’d told me about his friend (25F) who’d had a crush on him in high school- fine. He also told me that he’d stayed at her apartment for a night when he’d gotten there- also fine. But things got weird when I met her mom…

We went over to hers for dinner, and she and her mom only talked about how close he was to them. They told me that when he’d gone over to 25F’s house, he’d stripped down to his undies so she could do his laundry, and that she did his hair. (He’d never mentioned this.) They have a special nickname for him and tease me for not using it. The daughter even went upstairs to change into the same outfit I was wearing. 

The mom was even more possessive. For months now, she’s iced me out over and over…I didn’t hear from him for 2 days and later found out she’d taken him on a trip to NY. When he moved back, the mom flew in to help and asked him to stay in her hotel room for the night. (He could have stayed at mine.) 

I asked “one bed or two?” He said my suggestion was gross, she’s like a mom to him. 

She keeps crossing boundaries- she takes sips of his drink at dinner. When I take a bite of his food, she immediately asks him to “make her a bite.” This summer, they insisted that they all take a vacation together- I wasn’t invited.

A few days ago his mother passed. He decided to stay in his condo alone for the night. 50sF flew in at 1 AM and went straight to his condo. There’s no couch and it’s a 1 bedroom. She slept in his bed for two days. 

I was shocked but I didn’t say anything, this is NOT the time- he can barely talk and is processing his grief. But I was so appalled and insulted. She also told me not to come over to check on him. She even asked me to drive her around and run errands for her. I ignored that and went over. 

Every time I tried to get close to him, cuddle in his bed, sit next to him, she took my place or made him move. Then she got ice cream on her shirt, and she took it off in the living room(!) As I was laying next to him, she hovered over us.

His uncle and grandparents seem to have an issue with her too. He told me that she and his family were “fighting over him.” 

He never stops her from crossing the line. He needs to solve that, or I need to eventually walk away because I can’t feel like an intruder in my own partnership forever. WIBTA to ask for some boundaries here? Or am I being jealous and controlling?

Edit - *UPDATE*

I called him this morning, I haven’t heard anything in three days. He was asleep (whoops 😬). He said he would be driving back with her either today or tomorrow. He’s taking the family dog, and it’s a 14 hour drive. I asked him to let me know when he’s coming and keep me in the loop. 

My current plan is to show up when they get in, regardless of the time, and tell her she needs to get a hotel or she can even sleep on my couch (ughhhh but they might get in at a weird hour where she can’t check in, preferable over sharing his bed). She is not sleeping there. I feel sick to my stomach and am trying to do calming breathing but I can’t imagine letting another night in a shared bed go by. 

That’s all I’ve got for now! I’ll update what happens when they get here, lemme know your thoughts on the current plan!

EDIT *UPDATE 2*

So he texted me saying he was in the car headed back, and I couldn’t stop myself. I said something, and I’ll provide exact quotes from the texts below, the links to see the screenshots can be found on Imgur [HERE](https://imgur.io/a/1n9B0iN) as well if you want to see it that way. 

—-

ME: 
Have a safe drive, but I need to be upfront with this: where is (the friend) staying tonight? I think she needs to get a hotel room. 

HIM: 
I don't care to be honest. She's like a parent to me so its never made me uncomfortable. I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable I don't have my couch yet otherwise I would sleep there. 

But I'm not going to make her get a hotel when she's like family to me 

I need you to be ok with this right now please. I can't handle more questioning about my decisions than my family has already done every single day for the past week.  So please just say you are ok right now. We can talk about this a different time if you want to but I'm barely keeping my shit together

—— 

So I just…wow. I was speechless. I know he’s struggling hard but I couldn’t believe he would blatantly say her staying over was more important to him than my clear discomfort. I do want to have an in person discussion about this with him, for those who would say leave now (I hear you, but it’s hard to do a 180 in a day!)",derpypets_bethebest,1134,466,0.9399999976158142,0.09032187337703697,1694733478,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ix6hb/aita_older_woman_is_trying_to_mother_my_bf_and/,2023,9
16vqlbg,AITA for taking my teen daughter side over my girlfriend,"I'm a 48-year-old man, separated from my 40-year-old wife for the past eight months. We were together for 18 years and have four daughters aged 17, 14, 5, and 4. Despite our separation, my wife and I remain on amicable terms. She resides in our marital home, while I'm currently living in our rental property.  
  
Approximately four months ago, I rekindled a relationship with a former college girlfriend who's 47. We were together for five years back in the day, but parted ways because she wasn’t ready to settle and have kids. She now has a 13-year-old daughter.  
  
A notable issue has arisen between my eldest daughter, who's turning 18 soon, and my girlfriend. My daughter is assertive, outspoken, and holds strong to her principles. She's very bonded with her mother. On the other hand, my girlfriend is quite strict with her own child. She sets clear boundaries, including computer usage limits, basic phones, no TV during school days, and has various disciplinary measures. In contrast, my wife and I have been much more relaxed parents. Our kids have more freedom with their devices, social activities, and we're more lenient when it comes to discipline.  
  
Last night, a situation escalated. My daughters, girlfriend, and her child gathered at my place after school. The plan was for the kids to finish homework, have dinner, and then for us to have a family game night. However, my oldest was engrossed in Instagram and YouTube, which led my girlfriend’s daughter to request similar screen time.   
  
When my girlfriend suggested my eldest put away her laptop to join the game, my daughter declined. My girlfriend insisted, emphasizing the importance of family time. My daughter firmly reiterated her decision to abstain. As I entered the scene, my girlfriend, in front of everyone, said I should intervene. My daughter, clearly frustrated, asserted that my girlfriend isn't her mother and left the room.  
  
I communicated to my girlfriend that while my daughter’s tone could've been better, I’ve never imposed strict family time, and she was preoccupied. Upset, my girlfriend promptly left with her daughter. She later texted me, expressing her belief that I'm permitting my daughter's purported disrespect and criticized our parenting approach.

16vqp7v,AITA for making a Tiktok that somewhat exposed my influencer parents?,"I'm (16m) banished to my aunt's house right now and while she agrees with me that I'm not an asshole for having these feelings, she says she agrees with my parents that i was an asshole for the TikTok that I made about our real lives. Without saying too much, my parents had me while they were in college and i lived with my grandparents until they graduated and got married. I have three younger siblings and we all live in a large city together. My dad has a real job and my mom basically just writes a blog and has social media accounts. She NEVER mentions me. I'm never in pictures. My siblings are because they were written about from the time my mom was pregnant with them, after they got married. She writes a lot about our ""lifestyle"" and brags about how thrifty she is and simple but she doesn't tell people that my grandparents give us money and that she blows it on really expensive things like buckets and sweaters. Trust me when I say that NONE of what you see online about my family is true except for where we live and our names. Anyway, I vented a little bit to my friend about how my parents go back and forth on pretending to be poor but then not and then back again, depending on who they talk to. And i said that sometimes that meant that my mom buys something expensive and stupid to brag about but then I have to hear about eating less or being ""more simple"" about birthday wishlists because life is too expensive. So we made a Tiktok at my house. I pointed out stuff like ""here's my mom's ONE sweater that cost $400 and that's why i got this for Christmas"" and pointed to a kid's art set. I pointed out some stuff that she told her readers she was gifted that she actually bought, too. My Tiktok doesn't get much attention at all but one of my friend's showed it to her mom and her mom showed my mom. My parents are mad and say that doing stuff like this hurts the whole family because it could affect sponsorships and maybe book deals and Dad said i was an asshole for doing the video. So, am I? I think I have a right to say the truth but maybe I should have kept it more private between me and my friends. By the way, they made me delete the account so no one else is going to know.
