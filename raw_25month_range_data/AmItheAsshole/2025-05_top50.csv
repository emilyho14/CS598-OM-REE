1kp4ekd,"AITA for giving my daughter $60 a week, but my son nothing?","I (45F) have two kids, 17F and 15M. We moved earlier this year to be closer to my parents as my parents health is declining. My daughter was excited about the move, but my son has struggled to adjust.

Due to the move, my job shifted to hybrid, and I needed a work-from-home setup. My bedroom is too small, and the only options were the lounge or one of the kids’ rooms during school hours. I proposed this to them - my son flat-out refused (“no way in hell”), but my daughter offered her room and half-joked about charging me rent for the space.

I thought it was fair, as I get a $20/day work-from-home allowance. I agreed to give it to her if she was okay with me setting up a small office in her room. I work from 8:30 to 5:00, and she usually starts homework right after I finish, so it’s worked out well.

Now the issue: my son is pissed that his sister is getting $60. I don’t do regular allowances, just canteen money (about $10/week) and other needs as they come up. I told him he had the same opportunity and was now shit out of luck. He got angry and brought up the move, saying he never gets to see his friends. (For the record, I drive them back to visit every two weeks for visits) I told him I understood his feelings but said I wouldn’t tolerate being spoken to like shit. He then started an argument with his sister too - going in on her for being an opportunistic bitch and she called him a whiny little asshole.

To cool off, I offered one of them the option to stay at their grandparents for the night - not as a punishment but to break the tension. My son opted to go & while dropping him off, my mom told me I was favoring my daughter and should be paying them equally. My dad disagreed, saying my son had the chance and was shit out of luck.

AITA?

1kynst0,AITA for not putting away my copy of The Handmaid’s Tale?,"My(20) uncle and cousin(14) are currently staying with us since their house is going through some repairs. Cousin sleeps in my room. Mom told me to put certain books away since they are inappropriate so I put them in a small locked drawer. I didn’t put The Handmaid’s Tale and some of my other dystopian novels there, though. Barely any space left so I had to pick which ones to lock up. The way I figured it, she probably wouldn’t be interested in them and the book in question full of my distracting, barely legible to anyone else annotations(I studied it for A Level English Literature when I was 16-17 and my handwriting was atrocious back then).

But she did end up getting interested in it. I came home one day to find out that she had been reading it and my uncle had found out and was telling her she is too young. Then he turned to me and berated me, saying it was careless to leave something she is too young for out on the shelf",EfficientWest871,14157,2220,0.8999999761581421,0.6952744167231334,1748556751,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kynst0/aita_for_not_putting_away_my_copy_of_the/,2025,5
1klzbca,AITA for grounding my stepdaughter for selling my formal dress?,"I 37F have a stepdaughter, Amy, 16F. Amy was looking for formal dresses, and I mentioned that I have my old formal dresses. She picked my old prom dress to wear, and she has kept it in her wardrobe since wearing it at prom. I don't fit in my old dresses anymore, and I kept them and some other clothes to hand down to my kids, however, I have two sons who aren't interested. Since my nieces, 15F and 13F are interested in my clothes, I planned to give them the rest once they were old enough to fit them.

  
Amy left her earbuds in her sweatpants pocket and turned on the washing machine. When she asked for new ones, me and her dad told her to save up to buy new ones (she works part time) as she wanted an expensive brand new pair and not the wired earphones I had offered. 

  
Amy went to stay with her mom, and when she got back, she had the new earbuds she wanted, so I asked if her mom had bought them for her, and she said she had resold my dress on a second-hand site and bought herself the earphones. The dress is 100% silk, one of a kind, and the brand doesn't exist anymore. I was really upset to hear she had sold my dress, without even asking.

  
I confiscated her earbuds and told her I would give them back when she repaid me the cost of what she sold the dress for. My husband thinks I am being too harsh, as I wasn't explicit on whether I was lending or giving her the dress. Amy has gone to live with her mom since and thinks I am being unfair.

1kvd1su,"AITA for posting screenshots of my SIL's texts online and ""making her look bad""?","I (29F) and my wife (28F) had our sons six days ago, the pregnancy was complicated and they had TTTS (Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome) which resulted in them coming early. They are currently in the Neonatal Unit and my wife and I practically live there so we can spend time with our boys. 

My brother and his wife got married two days ago, I didn't want to leave my sons or my wife so I missed the wedding though I sent them their gift from us and a text wishing them a fantastic day and I thought nothing more of it. Yesterday I got a text from my new sister in law explaining that because my wife and I missed the wedding she'd need us to send her £140 for our plates of food. I asked her if she was joking and she told me that she got my wife couldn't go as she had to stay in the hospital but that I wasn't the one who gave birth so I could have went and saved two plates of food from going to waste.

I told her she was being ridiculous and asked if my brother was aware she was asking his sister for money for food, she brushed that off and said weddings were expensive and she had to try and recoup her losses and this should be between us ""woman to woman"". Between this and her thinking I should have gone anyway I admit I lost my temper. I ended up taking screenshots of the conversation and posting it to facebook.

This shocked several people in the family and she must have gotten bombarded with messages as she told me to take it down, as I was making her look bad and people were taking it out of context and thinking she was some kind of villain. My brother called me and told me not to worry about the money that it was stupid to expect us to pay for the plates though asked me to take the post down and he'd handle it. He seemed kind of shocked by her even asking this.

Did I go too far? My wife is mostly upset by our sil's comment about how I wasn't the one to give birth, as if it makes me less of their mother. Maybe I should have handled it better but I admit at the time I wasn't thinking very clearly.

Edit: I thought I said in the post but I didn't (sorry running on very little sleep) I took down the post when my brother asked me to do so.",SavingsBitter1426,11136,790,0.949999988079071,0.4555738300947755,1748207077,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kvd1su/aita_for_posting_screenshots_of_my_sils_texts/,2025,5
1km0znf,AITA for refusing to give up my life insurance payout and asking my ex’s family to refinance the car he left me?,"So my ex passed away recently in a work-related accident. It’s sad, of course. I have a lot of mixed emotions about it. But the truth is, we hadn’t been together in over a year when it happened. We were together for five years, and we broke up because he cheated on me and got someone else pregnant. That breakup wrecked me. It took me a long time to recover. I haven’t seen him since.

After the breakup, I went no contact. I’ve spent the past year healing, learning to be happy again, and moving on. I didn’t go to the funeral. I didn’t want to see the baby mama or his family. And while I’m not happy he’s gone, I can’t say I’m devastated anymore either. I grieved this person when I left the relationship.

Now here’s where things get complicated.

Six months after our breakup, and **after**   the baby was born, he took out a life insurance policy. In it, he named me as the 50% beneficiary. His mom and the baby mama each got 25%. I didn’t know this until the insurance company called me. I assumed it was some paperwork leftover from when we were together. But nope this was a new policy, dated well *after* the breakup. That means this was his decision.

At the same time, there’s a car. He financed it while we were still together, but it’s under *my name and credit.* I begged him for **over a year** to refinance it, to the point the only reason I ever contacted him was for the refinancing of that car. He never refinanced that car, I doubt he was ever going to. Now that he’s gone, it’s still tied to me. The car is sitting in my garage, and his family has reached out saying the baby mama needs it for work. I told them, fine. You can have it as soon as it’s refinanced and no longer on *my credit.* I will **GLADLY** sign whatever paper they need. But I am not going to risk my credit on people I don’t trust to make payments.

And now they’re demanding that I give up the life insurance payout too. That I should “do the right thing” and give it to his mom or the baby mama. But here’s the thing, *I didn’t ask for any of this.* I didn’t ask to be put on that policy. He made that choice, after everything that happened between us.

Honestly?

I feel like I *earned* that money. I spent five years with that man. Five years dealing with the stress, the gaslighting, the emotional pain, the betrayal. I loved him deeply and I lost so much trying to make that relationship work. I stayed with him until *I found out* his baby mama was pregnant, because he was *actively hiding it from me* at that time. I was with him through the worst parts of his life. If anything, this money feels like the only thing I ever got back from all the bullshit. He chose to leave it to me. Probably because deep down, he knew how badly he treated me.

1ktu6ss,AITA for walking out of my parents' anniversary party when my brother announced his engagement to my ex?,"I just discovered my brother (29M) has secretly been seeing my college ex-girlfriend (32M) over the past year. We broke up 8 years ago and we'd been going out 4 years prior to the split but we actually knew each other very seriously when we'd been together. I challenged him when I discovered this and he said he didn't say anything to me b/c he didn't want me to get angry with him.

Last weekend we celebrated my parents' 40th anniversary celebration. My brother brought her to the party as his guest without letting me know beforehand. Her arrival with my brother left me shocked since we broke up and I hadn't laid eyes on her since then. During the meal, they declared their engagement and my mom began crying tears of joy.

I couldn't take it and left. My brother trailed behind me and we got in a big fight. I told him he should have warned me at the very least. He said I was being self-centered and spoiling our parents' party.

That evening my dad phoned me telling me I humiliated the family by leaving.

I don't have romantic feelings towards my ex anymore, but the surprise reveal and secrecy at my parents' celebration feel thoughtless.

1kunvna,AITA for refusing to give a reward after two kids returned my opened mail with money inside?,"I'm 27F but I am pretty petite and could easily pass for like a high schooler. So I am home alone at my parent's place dog sitting and I get back from walking the dog and as soon as I close the door and lock it, I hear the ring cam doorbell go off and knocking and I can see through their Alexa that it's two kids. Probably middle school aged. They have a bike and scooter. I did not see them when I came back from the walk, so I don't know where they were waiting or where they even came from.  

They are just standing there and so I'm thinking that they are trying to sell something or another so I plan to just ignore them and focus on getting the dog resettled. Except now the dog is barking like crazy because she senses someone by the door and I can hear the kids say ""I just saw her go inside"". They then say ""we found something of yours and it has money inside"".

So they are knocking like crazy and even start kicking the door. I figure that I'll just speak to them through the ring bell so I say (without opening the door) ""Hi. Just leave it in the mailbox. I cannot open the door right now because my dog is not friendly"". Which is, true, but also like, I have no idea if this is a scheme or if there's an adult in a car waiting for them, etc. My mind is going into all sorts of scenarios that could end horribly for me. 

After them standing there for like five minutes, I can see through the cam that they put it in the mailbox and walk slowly away on their bike/scooter. About two minutes later, one of the kids comes back and puts his hood on. Rings the doorbell and I can see him put his hood on and I say ""what's up?"" through the ring cam. And he says ""My friend wants a reward"". And I say ""thank you for bringing back the mail but there is no reward, please leave"". And the kid just stands there demanding a reward. So I say ""I have your faces, if you try to threaten me, I will call the cops"". The kid then says ""call the cops I don't care! I returned your *money*. If I ever find something for your house again, I'm not returning it"". He then walks away before giving me the finger. 

I'm not looking to get these kids into any sort of trouble or anything because I think they were just being dumb fucks and they couldn't have been older than like 14/15 but AITA for not giving a reward? What they returned ended up being an opened envelope (don't know how they got it, if it was already ripped, or if they opened it) from my aunt that had a $20 bill in it (my aunt is old school like that). 

I've had my fair share of finding misplaced items/wallets and I've never once demanded or even expected a reward. My friend wanted me to post their faces on the NextDoor app and blast them but I don't know. So, AITA?

1kw7k5z,AITAH for putting up a security cam that caught my neighbor's kid wrecking my yard?,"For the past month, weird stuff kept happening around my house (I’m F, 42). Gnomes knocked over, mailbox dented, flowers pulled out… just random annoying vandalism. I figured it was some local kids, but had no proof. After the 3rd time my flowers got destroyed, I’d had enough.

I set up a small cam facing my front yard. It’s on my property, not hidden or anything, just not super obvious. A couple days later, boom — caught my neighbor’s 10 y/o son yanking out my flowers and tossing them in the street. Clear as day.

I went over to their house, calm, showed the vid on my phone. I thought they’d apologize or offer to replace the plants. Nope. They lost it. Accused me of “spying” on their kid, said I was “overreacting” to a “harmless prank,” and even threatened legal action for “filming their child.”

I explained the camera’s legal, on my property, and only points at my yard. They wouldn’t hear it. It turned into a full-blown yelling match.

Now they’re telling everyone I’m some creepy neighbor who hates kids. The street’s basically split. Some are on my side, some are giving me dirty looks.

So yeah… AITAH for putting up a camera to protect my stuff?

1kjkog3,WIBTA for wearing deodorant even though someone may be allergic?,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons. 

So, at the beginning of the second semester, we got a new teacher. This teacher said she had scent sensitivity and couldn't be around any perfume or fragrances. 


The people in my family have scent sensitives, so all my deodorant, soaps are unscented. 

I have continued wearing this deodorant for months, and I sit in the front of the class. This teacher has never seemed to react. 

Also, some of my friends put on scent products in the morning, and she never react, even though you can clearly smell it. 

Yesterday, I had Gym class and it ran over. I had to change into my school uniform and had no time to apply the deodorant. The bell rang and I was late for class. 

I reapplied the deodorant in the bathroom and went to class. However, I forgot to zip up my backpack. When I was in class, the deodorant fell out, and the teacher saw the deodorant. She asked if it was sent, and I said no. She then yelled at me, saying she was having an allergic reaction. 

But here's the thing. She didn't look like it. Her breathing didn't change, no watery eyes, stuffy nose, anything. And she just taught the class like normal.  

I felt bad and emailed her about what deodorant she didn't react so I could buy it, but got a response saying that was inappropriate. 

Part of me thinks she is faking. So, would I be the asshole if I just countinued wearing it.

1kzjdfn,"AITA for continuing ""adult"" activities in front of children because they crashed my party?","I own a lakefront property and usually enjoy hosting friends and family. For example, every 4th of July I throw a big BBQ, cover all the food and drinks, and don’t mind if people bring extra guests as long as it’s respectful. My family gets it and never takes advantage. If someone brings more than one person, they’ll usually contribute something like drinks or sides.

This past Memorial Day Weekend, I planned a reunion for a close college friend visiting from abroad. It was meant to be a kid-free, adults-only weekend. Lots of drinking, with friends staying over afterwards. 

My cousin happened to ask if she could use my house and lake that weekend, and I kindly said no and suggested nearby resorts. She got annoyed, saying she’d already told her kids they were coming since I usually never say no. I explained about my party, and she didn’t reply, so I thought it ended there.

Then Saturday afternoon, she showed up with her kids anyway. I told her they couldn’t come inside, but they could hang out at the community lakefront nearby. The issue was that the kids kept trying to come in to use the bathroom, grab water, etc. My friends weren’t doing anything illegal, just drinking and having fun like adults do, but my cousin asked me to get them to tone it down because of her kids. I told her no. She wasn’t invited, and I wasn’t changing my party for uninvited guests. Plus, they were already well into drinking for the day so it’s not like I could instantly sober up 20+ adults.

Now she’s telling our family I let my friends act “inappropriately” in front of her kids. Some relatives think I should’ve paused the drinking, but others agree she was out of line for showing up uninvited. 

For what it’s worth, the kids didn’t interact with my friends and were only inside briefly (I made sure to keep an eye on them when they came in), but they could see the alcohol. Since they drove 1.5 hours, I didn’t feel right just kicking them out completely, but I also wasn’t going to let her hijack the weekend.

1kmru7h,AITA for not letting my husband with $13k debt have access to my credit card,"Okay so my husband (36M) and me (33M) keep getting into arguments over money, especially getting him onto my credit card as an authorised user.

I’ve got 0 credit score because I immigrated here to the U.S. and only just managed to open a line of credit. I wasn’t even able to finance a car without huge interest on it (only one bank accepted me) so I’m still without a car.

He has not been good with his credit history, racking up $13k of debt with Amex before we had met which he has yet to pay off. 

I suggested to him he should see if he can improve it with a credit builder loan but I am not comfortable with him being on my credit card or having my CC details in his phone. He responds with saying married couples should be sharing assets and building credit together? 

Is it a given that spouses should have shared credit? Because I’m trying to establish my own credit history I cannot risk a bad credit score if he racks up debt without the means of paying it off. At the same time I feel guilty because he did support me when I wasn’t able to work before I got employment authorisation. 

Am I the asshole here for protecting my own interests? 

UPDATE: Thanks everyone! I really needed this vote of confidence and encouragement to stand my ground on this. I feel less guilty for putting my foot down with him. Going to see if I can put a freeze on my credit report this week and see if we can get him onto a personal finance course.

On his days off, he usually says “wow I need to mow the lawn” and never ends up mowing it. Eventually he says he can’t do it anymore because it’s too late in the day and might disturb the neighbors. He also says it’s because sticks need to be picked up first and the leaves from the fall need to be removed. To help with that, I’ve actually went out, picked up all the sticks, bagged up the dead leaves. He still hasn’t mowed it. 

The grass is getting very tall. I’m worried about snakes and ticks in the yard. It’s also getting to the point where our lawn mower is going to have a difficult time handling it, especially in the front yard where the lawn is more lush. I had a neighbor complain to me when I was outside one day. 
 
After 2 more days off of not mowing it after he said he would, I asked him to please mow it before he goes into work. He works evenings and was scheduled to go in at 5:30pm. It’s one of his late days. He has hours to do it between waking up and needing to get ready for work. It only takes 45 minutes. 

He says I’m nagging about it and he will do it when he has time. He doesn’t have time and doesn’t want to mow it before work because he will be tired at work. He says he will do it on his next day off. I told him he’s been saying that for weeks and it hasn’t been done and he just repeated that I need to stop nagging him.

1kevlmt,AITAH My partner pays rent in my property,"I (31F) own a property that me and partner (31M) and our baby daughter live in. 
We split all bills 50/50 even though he earns more, I also buy her clothes, pay her swimming lessons and all the bits I notice that she needs. 
He has lived here for 2.5 years and I have lived here 5 years. I moved out of my parents when I was 17 and I worked my ass off to buy the place by myself 5 years ago. I was paying rent and saving for a mortgage at the same time, it was hard work and took dedication as I did not get any financial help.
He has asked to be added to the mortgage as he has been contributing here (monthly payments only), he says he is entitled to a share and his family have been doing research on that.
I feel hurt that they would do that, it feels like I’m not sure if I can trust him or them now. I haven’t had an easy journey to get to the security that I built for myself and I can be a bit over protective about that, especially now I have a child and inevitably I want to build her future too. 
I’m very careful not to put myself in vulnerable positions but now I feel I’m vulnerable. We have really disagreed on this, and he has moved out.
Morally I find it wrong that the father of my child, and his family would support him taking from me and his daughter. He said that would never happen, but why would they research it? And also, I’m not putting someone on the mortgage who does not have any actual investment to put down, it feels like he wants an easy ride to the property ladder.
Am I wrong to be upset? Am I the AH?

1kzg04r,AITA for refusing to accept the wrong drink at a restaurant nm,"Recently, my husband and I went to a restaurant with his family. My husband and I ordered their ""handmade"" margaritas. These were listed with your choice of anejo tequila with fresh sqeezed lime juice and simple syrup. However, when the margaritas arrived, they were in giant fishbowl margarita glasses (1 shot of tequila, plus lime and simple syrup cannot fill a 20 oz glass) and they were ORANGE. I immediately knew we were brought the house margaritas with the mixed sweet and sour, but I tried it anyway. It was awful. My husband shrugged and said he'd drink his, but at $20 each, I wasn't going to accept a cheap tequila with a mix. 

I called the waitress over and explained that we were given the wrong margaritas, but she insisted they were ""Handmade"". So I said, ""Ok. Well, it's not good. So you can just take it, I can't drink it. I don't want anything else, please just take it off the bill."" 

Which should have ended it, except she came back with the bartender holding the drink. He asked what was wrong, I told him what I ordered, he insisted that's what it was. So I asked, ""Then why is it orange? If it's lime and tequila and simple syrup, why is it orange?"" He looked at me, then looked at the drink and said, ""You're right. It's not the right drink. I can make you the right one and I'll remake his."" 

I said no, I didn't want a drink anymore, I just wanted it corrected on the bill to reflect the $10 margarita my husband actually received. They left, and I thought it was settled until the MANAGER came over and insisted they remake the margaritas to make it right. At this point I was annoyed and regretting not letting them remake it just to be left alone, but I also no longer even WANTED it, so I said, ""How about I just get a mezcal, neat, instead?"" That seemed to make the manager happy. But after the manager left, my husband said, ""Why didn't you just let them bring you a replacement the first time? Or just drink it when she told you it was right? You've made everyone uncomfortable."" My MIL said I was right to send it back, his brother told me I should have just given him my drink, and my SIL didn't say anything, so I'm wondering if I should have just let it be?",Familiar_Rice1923,3029,315,0.9399999976158142,0.1334789145549663,1748640426,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kzg04r/aita_for_refusing_to_accept_the_wrong_drink_at_a/,2025,5
1kp5ed0,AITA for accusing my wife of using weaponized incompetence to get out of doing things she'd rather I do for her.,"The wife has been going to see a life coach and she a few months ago came back with the term ""weaponized incompetence"" which basically means a husband is intentionally failing to do a task he doesn't want to do, so that the wife will just do it herself to get out of helping out. This is something she accused me of doing after she pushed some of her household duties onto me. I was simply just learning how to do things in the way she likes after not doing them since we moved in together.

Ex. I started doing dishes, I washed them, put them up and she didn't like the way they were arranged because I arranged them by what we used the most, whereas she did it by height. ""Weaponized Incompetence"".

So recently, after a package was stolen off our door step while I was out of town, I started reviewing our front of house cameras and I saw my wife removing the doors off her jeep while preparing to take our sons to the beach. This is strange because until that moment, I had thought she couldn't do it herself as it's too heavy and/or complicated for her to do it herself. So I always did it for her. Not really an issue, I don't mind doing it for her, and I had just assumed she figured it out by herself since I wasn't there.

This Friday we decided to go for a nature drive, and my wife said she'd get everything ready while I was at work so we could go the second I got home. I got home and the doors were still on. I ask her why she didn't take the doors off. She said ""You know that's too heavy for me to do myself, I was waiting on you"". I told her I saw the video of her doing it through the front cams.

She got flustered and I quickly realized she probably could do this the entire time but just pretended not to be able to. I called it what it is, weaponized incompetence. She got incredibly mad and accused me of not wanting to help her ever and said I had been saving this to ""deflect"" from my own shortcomings. We had a huge fight and the trip ended up getting postponed, which disappointed our sons.

I don't think I was wrong to say what I said but here we are. Am I the Asshole?",ShenBapiro34,2182,598,0.8999999761581421,0.1315967261276008,1747521881,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kp5ed0/aita_for_accusing_my_wife_of_using_weaponized/,2025,5
1kzignf,AITA for telling a clients boyfriend to leave?,"I’m a 27yo (F) and I work as a piercer in a parlour. Recently, this girl came into the shop with her boyfriend and told me that she wanted to get both of her nipples pierced. As I was helping her pick out the jewellery she wanted for her piercings, I noticed that the entire time her boyfriend was just sulking behind her. He kept asking her if she really had to get her nipples pierced and was overall just creating an extremely awkward vibe. 

When we went into the back so I could do the piercing, her boyfriend came along, which I don’t mind as many people bring someone along with them. As I was preparing everything, her boyfriend asked me If there was any way I could pierce her nipples without having to see her boobs. I told him that obviously she doesn’t have to just completely show me her boobs, but I still need to be able to see her nipples or how else would I be able to pierce her?  He then started speaking to her quietly but I could still hear what he was saying. He was saying that he wasn’t comfortable with someone who wasn’t him seeing her in that way. I didn’t understand why he was being so insecure as this is just my job? I don’t view what I’m doing as sexual, i’m just simply giving someone a piercing

And then he asked me in these exact words if i’m “into girls” and I tried to make a lighthearted joke by asking him why that mattered and he just responded by asking if i’m going to be “turned on” by seeing his girlfriends boobs. His girlfriend kept telling him to shut up and just let me do the piercings so they can get it over with. I am straight and I’m engaged to a man but why does that even matter?? Even if I was into girls that doesn’t mean i’m going to just get turned on by piercing your girlfriends nipples?? 

I politely asked him if he would mind just standing outside while i done the piercings because I didn’t appreciate the questions he was asking me as they were extremely inappropriate. He then started accusing me of wanting to be alone with his girlfriend, he also spotted the engagement ring on my finger and said he felt sorry for whoever had to marry me knowing this is my job. I kept telling him to leave, he refused and started getting loud enough that he alerted several of my coworkers who all came in to see what was happening. 

My coworkers were eventually able to get him to leave and his girlfriend decided that she would leave with him. I told her that I still had no problem doing the piercings for her but she said that she didn’t want to make the situation any worse and she apologised for the trouble and left. Afterwards my manager told me that I should have just ignored what he was saying and just done the piercings. I just felt that him asking me If i was gonna be turned on by piercing his girlfriend was extremely gross and inappropriate?? Most of my coworkers agreed that I should have just ignored what he was saying and not have made a big deal out of it but i’m honestly just so conflicted. AITA?

1kcnegm,AITA For Being Offended Over Not Being Included In My Family’s Matching “I Love You” TATOO,"Since my dad left my Mom, Sister and I have been tight. There for each other ya know? Some days ago my Mom and Sister came home spontaneously with matching “I Love You 3,000” tattoos. I asked them why I hadn’t been invited or included and my Mom snapped at me saying “they’re inspired by that dumb marvel movie you sister likes you wouldn’t have wanted one”. Um hello? I love marvel and have been collecting comics and memorabilia for years it’s what she gets me for my birthday and Christmas every year I would have loved to participate, and that’s what I told her. Then she changed her answer saying “not everything has to be equal and that’s life, sometimes you just don’t get included in family things.”.

1kyq026,AITA for watching a girl park because I was impressed and getting called a sexist creep for it?,"I (48M) was walking back to my car after grabbing lunch downtown when I saw a girl probably early 20s trying to parallel park an older SUV into an extremely tight spot. It was one of those gaps where even newer cars with parking sensors would struggle. I could tell right away her SUV was an older model, no cameras or sensors at least not from the factory, so I figured it’d take some real skill to get in cleanly.

I stopped on the sidewalk and watched. I wasn’t staring like a weirdo, just standing with my coffee, kind of interested. I actually thought she must be a really good driver to even try that spot with that car. I even told myself maybe I’d pick up a technique or two. Also, as she was parking, we made eye contact and I smiled, kind of like an encouraging “you got this” thing. I also figured if she ended up tapping the car in front or behind and drove off, I could leave a note or something. I wasn’t looking to get involved, but I’ve seen people drive off after a hit before.

She ended up pulling it off fast and clean, two moves, right in, no issue. As she got out, she looked right at me and said, “Are you serious?”

I said, “Sorry?”

She goes, “You’ve just been standing there watching me this whole time like I’m some kind of show. What, you think I can’t park because I’m a girl?”

I said, “No, not at all. It was just a tight spot and an older car, and you handled it really well. I was just—”

She cut me off. “Save it. You’re literally just standing around watching a young woman try to park like it’s entertainment. It’s creepy and pathetic. Don’t pretend it’s about the car.”

I said, “Look, it had nothing to do with you being a woman. I just figured you must’ve known what you were doing to even attempt that spot, and I was curious. That’s all.”

She scoffed and said, “Yeah, sure. You’re not the first guy to pull the ‘I was just being impressed’ line. It’s sexist and weird. Try minding your own business next time.”

She walked off before I could say anything else. I’ll admit I was kind of stunned. I didn’t say anything rude, I wasn’t leering or making comments, just quietly watching in public for maybe 30 seconds.

Later, I told my sister about it, and she didn’t even hesitate. She just said, “Yeah, that’s exactly the kind of thing that makes women feel uncomfortable. Don’t be surprised she called you out.”

I honestly don’t see how it was sexist. I didn’t assume she couldn’t park. If anything, I assumed she could, which is why I watched. It had nothing to do with gender. It was a tough park, an old SUV, and I was just observing. It’s a public sidewalk. I didn’t touch her car, didn’t speak to her, didn’t do anything but stand there.

1knjmh3,AITA for not inviting my brother’s fiancée to my wedding after she didn’t invite me to hers?,"So this has been bugging me for a while and now it's turning into family drama, so I need an outside perspective.

I’m (29F) getting married this fall. My brother (31M) is also recently engaged to his fiancée, let’s call her Lisa (28F). We’ve always been friendly, not super close or anything, but there was never any bad blood between us. At least, I didn’t think so.

Anyway, a few months back, they started sending out wedding invites. I didn’t get one. I waited a bit, thinking maybe it was a mistake or that mine was just late, but then I asked my brother about it — kind of awkwardly — and he straight-up told me Lisa didn’t want me there. When I asked why, he said she felt like I “draw too much attention” and she didn’t want “any distractions” on her big day.

That really hurt. I wasn’t planning to wear white or break into a choreographed dance or anything ridiculous. I just… show up, be supportive, enjoy the day. It felt like she saw me as some kind of threat, which honestly blindsided me.

Worse, my brother didn’t really stand up for me. He just said, “It’s her day, I want to support her,” and that was kind of that. I didn’t go. I tried to let it go even though it really stung.

Fast forward to now — my wedding is coming up and I decided not to invite Lisa. I invited my brother (just him), figuring I could at least try to maintain that relationship. But now he’s upset. He called and said I’m being petty and punishing him for something that wasn’t really his doing. I told him I just don’t feel comfortable having someone at my wedding who clearly didn’t want me at hers — it’s not about revenge, it’s about protecting my peace on my own day.

He said he won’t come without her and now our parents are getting involved. My mom thinks I did the right thing by setting a boundary, my dad says I should just invite her and not make it a bigger deal.

I honestly don’t know if I’m being reasonable or if I’m letting my feelings get the better of me. So… AITA?",cloudberryxxx,1637,534,0.949999988079071,0.10688080088385478,1747343698,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1knjmh3/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brothers_fiancée_to_my/,2025,5

It’s not a normal blender. It’s industrial strength. It's the kind of thing you’d use to puree cement.

She uses it *every single morning* at 6:00 a.m. to make a “power smoothie.” I have asked — politely, repeatedly — if she could maybe wait until like 8 a.m.? Or just make it the night before and keep it in the fridge?

She says (verbatim), “I have sensory needs and blending calms me.” She calls it her *emotional support blender*. She even named it. (**Gary.**) She says Gary helps her feel “in control of the chaos.”

I work night shifts and usually don’t get to bed until 3:00 a.m., so this means I'm getting jarred awake by a jet engine three hours into my sleep. Every. Day. Thanks Gary.

Last week, I lost it. I came out of my room, and said, “Tina, either Gary goes or I do.”

She cried. Legit tears. She said I was “ableist,” “cold,” and “don’t respect her coping mechanisms.” I feel bad now. Like, I *get* that people have mental health needs, but does it have to involve pulverizing frozen bananas at sunrise?

Things are good between us, but I’m naturally very introverted and need alone time to recharge — especially after a stressful semester at university.

My parents invited me to join a short family vacation (5 days at a lake house), and I was really looking forward to just relaxing, reading, and spending time with them. When I mentioned the trip to my boyfriend, he immediately assumed he was invited too and said something like, “Awesome, I could really use that break too.”

I awkwardly told him that it was meant to be a small family trip and that I wanted some solo downtime without needing to “host” or be social all the time. He seemed surprised but didn’t say much then.

Now, days later, he’s clearly distant. He hasn’t brought it up directly, but he’s been short with me and mentioned feeling “excluded.” A mutual friend told me he thinks it’s weird I wouldn’t want him there, and now I’m wondering if I was selfish.

I just wanted a quiet trip, not relationship drama.

i am very put off by this, because there isn't a lot of space already, and on top of that, i don't feel like he does enough around the house to have a say in the decor, especially something so drastic (ie. running a humidifier constantly which can create mold in enclosed spaces, blockading my favorite window in the house with his grow lights etc.) he doesn't pay rent, hardly does chores without an argument, never cleans up after himself or the messes he makes, and the only thing he pays for has been the electricity bill (twice now) and two months of internet. that is it.

Having a traditional office wasn’t working because I was constantly having to find a larger space to do my job, so my admin moved me a few years ago. 

I love having the space, and it comes with the benefits of a printer and bathroom. I have never been a gatekeeper of the space and don’t mind when nearby staff members need to use it even though there’s another workroom a few doors down. 

I have one coworker who frequently (several times per week) uses the bathroom. Not to be crude, but the smell she leaves behind is toxic. I have put air fresheners in the bathroom and bought a bottle of poopouri, but it doesn’t help. I genuinely think she needs to see a doctor.

I pulled her aside last week and explained that I would appreciate if she found an alternative location to do her business.

1kul2is,AITA for bringing my neighbors packages inside my apartment because I was worried they’d get stolen?,"I (28F) live in a mid-rise apartment building in the city. We don’t have a front desk or package lockers—just a narrow hallway where all deliveries get dumped. If you’re not home within a few hours, good luck.

My across-the-hall neighbor, Marcus (30s? late 20s? I honestly don’t know), gets a lot of packages. Fancy ones too—clothing boxes with brand names, curated subscription kits, expensive-looking stuff. I'm not trying to spy or anything, but when you live in close quarters, you notice these things. I’d occasionally see boxes just sitting out overnight while he was clearly out of town, which made me anxious on his behalf.

About six weeks ago, I heard him swearing in the hall and went out to see what was wrong. He said one of his packages—some cologne he’d ordered—got stolen. He looked genuinely upset and mentioned it wasn’t the first time. I said something like, “Man, this building really needs lockers or something.” He nodded but didn’t push it.

So after that, I started bringing his deliveries inside my apartment whenever I noticed they’d been sitting for more than a few hours. Just to be safe. I stacked them in a corner near my front door and gave them back when I saw him. Usually, he just said thanks and took them. No big conversation.

Then last week, he knocked and asked me to stop.

He wasn’t rude about it, but he looked super uncomfortable. He said he appreciated the intention, but it made him uneasy to know his stuff was in someone else’s apartment. He added that it felt like I was “tracking his movements” since I always seemed to know when he wasn’t home.

I was kind of stunned. I explained that I was just trying to help—that I wasn’t snooping, I just saw stuff piling up. He said, “I get it, but... yeah, it crosses a line. Please don’t touch my packages anymore.”

I said okay, and he left. But now I feel weird. I genuinely thought I was doing a good deed. I wasn’t opening his stuff, just holding it for a few hours until he got back. It’s not like I was rifling through his mail.

But then it got more awkward. A few days ago I saw him through his peephole (yes, I was walking to my door, not lurking lol), and he literally waited until I went back inside before he came out to grab his box. Like he’s timing it now?

Then this morning, I overheard him talking to another neighbor while checking his mail. He said something like, “Yeah, some people think doing favors means ignoring boundaries.” I don’t know he meant me, but… it felt pointed.

Now I’m second-guessing everything. I told my sister and she said it was “weirdly possessive” and that I should’ve just left a note asking if he wanted help next time. But I never thought it would turn into this.

So... AITA for taking matters into my own hands when I thought I was doing something neighborly?

Would love honest thoughts because now I feel like I’m the hallway psycho.",dunkdeboffin1,1027,610,0.9100000262260437,0.09331768043412375,1748118629,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kul2is/aita_for_bringing_my_neighbors_packages_inside_my/,2025,5

1ktv9pb,AITA for not voting for my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend and I hosted a PowerPoint presentation night with all of our friends (total 10 people).
It was a big bash where everyone would do a PowerPoint presentation on a pre determined topic and then vote for the best PowerPoint. 1st place and 2nd place Winners would get a couple bouquets of flowers.

We were all having a great time and everyone presented and we cast our votes. Reading out loud the number of votes each person received. 
After winners were announced and flowers were given out, my boyfriend pulled me aside. He was incredibly upset that he hadn’t gotten any votes and that I had not voted for his presentation.

I told him I only got to cast two votes (1st and second place) I was just trying to vote for the ones I thought were the best and some of our friends put incredible amounts of effort into their presentations. Some friends dressed up, one friend wrote a song on guitar, another included a 3d animation they made in theirs. While I loved the presentation my boyfriend did, and the topic was really funny and he loved getting to share it with the group, other members of our group clearly put a lot more effort into theirs.
I told him it was a tough call but I didn’t want to be biased.

I could tell he was still a bit upset, even after the party was over. I apologized and told him I should have voted for him.

Am I the asshole for not voting for my boyfriend’s presentation?

1kggjrd,AITA For telling a woman that I'm not at fault because she can't control her dog?,"Hey y'all! So, this morning I (25f) took my 6 month old lab/malinois mix puppy to the local park for a walk/training session. The way the park is set up is that there is a children's play area and a walking track that starts at the mouth of the play area and loops around the perimeter of the rest of the park (not the play area). So, on my final lap another couple with a medium mix breed dog gets out of a car and starts walking the path in the opposite way as me (so that we would meet in the middle). Once I notice them getting closer, I stepped off the path and start making my way to the parking lot, cutting through the grass because while my puppy is generally good with passing another dog no problem, I like to minimize the possibility of issues especially with us leaving. I'm still walking in the same direction I was, just about 50ft away from the path more in line with the parking lot. As we come almost parallel with this couple, their dog hits the end of its leash almost yanking the lady off her feet growling and barking and trying to get closer to us. I keep going, ignoring them and calling my puppy into a close heel to keep him from engaging with the other dog. This woman then proceeds to yell at me telling me that I'm at fault for her dog reacting and that I shouldn't be at the park cause I'm never there when they are and I'm the one causing a scene. I turn to this woman and tell her ""Don't blame me because you didn't train your dog and can't control him"". I then promptly continued and got to my car, loaded up my dog, and left, the whole time this lady is cussing me out and her dog is going even crazier. I was venting to my mom, and while she was empathetic, she told me that it was rude of me to respond instead of just continuing to walk away.

1ksaj9r,AITA for refusing to babysit my sister’s “miracle baby” after she refused to help me when I had a miscarriage?,"A year ago, I had a miscarriage after trying for a baby with my husband for 3 years. It was devastating. My sister (32F), who never wanted kids, announced she was pregnant two months later — a “miracle baby” after a one-night stand.

I congratulated her, but emotionally, I was still raw. I asked her not to talk about baby stuff constantly around me while I healed. She said I was being selfish and needed to “get over it.”

Fast forward — she had the baby, and now she’s constantly asking me (29F) to babysit. I declined gently at first, but recently I said I don’t feel emotionally ready to watch her child — the one she had after dismissing my grief.

She blew up, called me heartless, and said I’m punishing an innocent baby. My mom says I need to “be the bigger person” and “stop living in the past.” But I think I’m allowed to have boundaries.

AITA?

1kmu395,"AITA for telling my mom ""You lost two kids, do you want to lose another?"" when she treatened to kick me out?","Prefacing this with the fact that there is a lot of abuse and history I can't cram into a Reddit post.

My mom (50F) has always had problems with substance abuse, as well as untreated mental illness. After a few times of her getting drunk, one of which ended in a hospital visit, she vowed not to buy alcohol for herself. Her mental illness has led to the abuse, mostly mental, of me (20F) and my sister (17F).

The night of Mother's Day, my mom started drinking. She got inebriated. Every time she is drunk, it is a traumatic trigger for me. She lied to me and said she had two shots. Later she seemed more drunk, so I checked the trash and found ten shot bottles. I confronted her again and said that I wanted better for her and that she agreed to not have alcohol. She began to vent (she vents to me without my consent often) and scream to me about the loss of my siblings, which I did not know that was why she was drinking. This argument got heated, so I decided to go on a drive. Contacted my partner (19M) who offered to let me stay the night at his place. I accepted and went home to grab my things. My mother confronted me again. I said I was going to my partner’s house, and she threatened to kick me out of her home. She has done this on several occasions, then later told me that she ""never means it"" and says it ""only to instill the fear of god in me.""

When I came home, we had a discussion that I thought would fix things a little. I said it would be good for us to keep the alcohol out of the house and I could help find resources for therapy for her. She agreed to the alcohol, but declined therapy sternly. I also asked not to be threatened with homelessness which she did not seem receptive to.

Went to work the next day and came home. She begins an argument with me and states that ""if I wanted to not be homeless so bad, why doesn't she leave me the house and take my sister with her."" I asked if she would give me enough time to get a better job. She said ""I don't know."" I told her if she would leave me high and dry without that, which would be the same as being homeless, she would be throwing away the future she wanted for me (i would have to drop out of college to work) and i would go no-contact. She did not have remorse, and things got very heated until I said ""You lost two kids, do you want to lose another?"" in reference to going no-contact with her. I don't know if she interpreted it as that or taking my own life. She was, for lack of a better word, flabbergasted. I said ""I didn't want to pluck at your heartstrings but maybe that's what I need to get my point across."" She said ""that wasn't a pluck, that was a fatal blow.""

I have since apologized for what I said over text as I haven't been home as of the time of posting this.

I have a backup plan. I might be too jaded to tell if was I really disrespectful or rightfully standing up for my wellbeing.

1krg6rl,AITA for refusing to engage with my dead husband's secret mistress?,"My husband passed away suddenly and violently a year ago. While cleaning out his items I uncoverd several letters from a female detailing a 10 year affair - mailed to our home that he had apparently intercepted.  We had his creamation and private family ceremony, and then one year later to the day i get a text message out of nowhere from a female claiming to be his girlfriend.  She claimed she was the love of his life, and she told me that she knew I was keeping his creemains away from her and she wanted half of them.  Which was odd as I woked witht the funeral home and organized events to bury his cremains in a private family ceremony a month after his passing.

This woman also took it upon herself to contact my inlaws (his sister and brothers) and beg them to take them into their lives, send them photos of my husband and her together and said that I was a rotten human he promised her he would leave for many years but never did.  She also contacted our 18 year old daughter and posed as a friend of her fathers, got her to meet up for coffee and started asking all sorts of personal questions about me and my relationsip and the funeral.

During her message to me she called me many names, and was very immature.  I also need to note that this woman is 60 years old - a full 15 years older than myself, and claimed that my husband and her had big plans and that i was a rotten person and she would prove it and tell my inlaws.

Am I the a-hole for telling this woman not to interfere with my family and his family and to leave my daughter alone? I have blocked her, but I'm pretty shaken up.

She’s still mostly clear-headed but has some confusion—especially when it comes to money. My younger sister “Chloe” (45) has always had a history of asking for financial help. Over the past few years, I noticed Mom was constantly ""lending"" Chloe money for things like car repairs, rent, or medical bills. Chloe always promised to pay her back, but she never did.

Meanwhile, Chloe’s social media told a very different story. Fancy trips, new gadgets, designer stuff… all while Mom was suddenly being super frugal. She even stopped buying things she used to enjoy. It didn’t sit right with me.

Mom asked me to help her look at her bank statements because she was confused. With her permission, I started going through them and what I found made my stomach drop. Chloe had been taking large amounts of money for years—way more than what she claimed she needed. It wasn’t help anymore, it was financial abuse.

I confronted Chloe, showed her the evidence, and she flipped. Accused me of being jealous, trying to control Mom, etc. I gathered everything and showed our other siblings and Mom’s financial advisor. It was brutal, but the truth was undeniable.

Now Chloe’s been cut off, and most of the family has distanced themselves from her. She’s livid, saying I destroyed her life and tore the family apart. Mom’s heartbroken by the conflict, which absolutely kills me. Some relatives think I should’ve handled it quietly or just let it go for the sake of Mom’s peace.

1kun43r,AITA for not uprooting my life and moving to my parent’s city to take care of them?,"I (28M) am an only child. I currently live in Chicago with my wife (27F) and our newborn son born beginning of May. My parents live in Boise, where they eventually settled when I was in high school. They’re both in their late 50s early 60s now, don’t have extended family nearby, and have always expected that I’d eventually move back to be close to them.

For a long time, I was open to the idea. I didn’t promise, but I didn’t shut it down either. So I get why they held onto that hope. But over the past couple years, a lot changed. My wife and I built a life in here in Chicago, I started a screen printing side business and love that the arab community is strong here. My wife got a solid job, and I recently started new work remotely in tech. Basically we’re really starting to find a rhythm here it’s been amazing. 

Boise is much cheaper—yes. We’d probably save on a house and lower our expenses overall. But that would come at a huge emotional and logistical cost to my wife, who has her family, career, and support system here. She’d be isolated in Boise, and we’d both be giving up everything we’ve built including my side business—right when our newborn needs stability the most. Additionally the arab community in Chicago is so much stronger and more influential, and I’d love for my son to grow up around that. I had had a really tough time in Boise in not fitting in, and experiencing some racism - all and all not a great experience. 

They really wanted to bring up this conversation shortly after I had my son, I continuously tried to get them to talk to me in person or on a call about this but they just wanted to text. When I told them i’m not willing to move to Boise from Chicago they essentially had a massive crash out and disowned me as their son - deleting me off all their social media, leaving all our group chats, and saying I should change my last name. I offered multiple compromises: extended visits, frequent visits, even that my parents could move in with us for now (we have a space we could convert into a room for them), and we’d work toward buying a larger home with a separate suite for them within a few years. They refused. They said the only solution is me moving to them.

They said they feel abandoned, accused my wife of manipulating me, told me to stop messaging them, and said they’re cutting me off. My dad told me I should “consider my parents dead” and that he never wants to see me again. He said I lied to them by ever being open to moving. 

I’ve continually tried to stay respectful, even though they have been nasty, bad talking me, my wife, and my wife’s family. I’ve told them I love them and always will.

As far as teacher salaries go we are generally paid very well, but I also happen to be an incredibly frugal person. I have some goals for the future that are very important to me, so at this point in my life. So, especially when it comes to recurring expenses, I will choose the cheapest option available almost always. I could afford to pay more, but at this point in my life that doesn’t make sense to me.

Today, parent saw me buying canned chicken, a bag of rice, and some tortillas from a dollar store.(I don’t think she would ever step foot in a dollar store, but the store is next to a pretty fancy gym.) She started making comments to me about how she knows that we’re paid well, so it’s “unprofessional” to “make myself look poor” by buying food at the dollar store. I tried to deflect with humor like I usually do just talking about how I’m a cheapskate. That didn’t seem to work. She kept asking me questions about what the kids would think (I don’t think they care), and if I really want to be viewed that way (I don’t really care). I did have a chance to walk away, but I didn’t take it. Instead, I told her it was none of her business, and that on my free time I live whatever life I want to, and she has no say over that. That escalated the situation immensely. She ended up talking about how her taxes pay my salary.  That’s what I probably messed up because I followed up with “well then you should be happy. I’m making those tax dollars stretch.”

This is a multipurpose pool (family, lap, ect) and marked. 

On multiple occasions I have been bumped for various reasons (school needed the pool) but the most frustrating interruption in my workout was when a lady showed up demanding the lane I was in 20 minutes into my workout. She said it was her lane and she wanted to teach her kid to swim 

I didn't love moving but decided it wasn't the hill to die on that day. 

Flash forward to today and 10 minutes or so into my workout she shows up, kid in tow and tells me it's her lane and I need to move. 

I told her that lanes weren't assigned in that way and I want to be let alone to continue my workout. 

She didn't care for that answer and went and got staff who all acted like I'm an asshole who should've just moved
