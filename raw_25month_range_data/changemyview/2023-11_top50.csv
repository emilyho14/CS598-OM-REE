17llow9,"CMV: Conservatives do not, in fact, support ""free speech"" any more than liberals do.","In the past few years (or decades,) conservatives have often touted themselves as the party of free speech, portraying liberals as the party of political correctness, the side that does cancel-culture, the side that cannot tolerate facts that offend their feelings, liberal college administrations penalizing conservative faculty and students, etc.

Now, as a somewhat libertarian-person, I definitely see progressives being indeed guilty of that behavior as accused. Leftists aren't exactly accommodating of free expression. The problem is, I don't see conservatives being any better either.

Conservatives have been the ones banning books from libraries. We all know conservative parents (especially religious ones) who cannot tolerate their kids having different opinions. Conservative subs on Reddit are just as prone to banning someone for having opposing views as liberal ones.  Conservatives were the ones who got outraged about athletes kneeling during the national anthem, as if that gesture weren't quintessential free speech. When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he promptly banned many users who disagreed with him. Conservatives have been trying to pass ""don't say gay"" and ""stop woke"" legislation in Florida and elsewhere (and also anti-BDS legislation in Texas to penalize those who oppose Israel). For every anecdote about a liberal teacher giving a conservative student a bad grade for being conservative, you can find an equal example on the reverse side. Trump supporters are hardly tolerant of anti-Trump opinions in their midst.

17now0j,CMV: Leftists/LGBTQ+ people who support Palestine doesn't make sense.,"I'll start by saying I'm from SEA, so my perspective may be incomplete and I may have missing information, but I'll start with what information I think I know:

My understanding is Israel was formed after WW2 to give surviving Jews their own nation. This displaced the Palestinian people and while some do integrate into current Israel, a large number are in Palestine and over several years Israel has treated them badly and displaced them from their homes.

A few months ago Hamas, which my understanding is a terrorist group but is also supported and elected by the majority of Palestinians, launched a cowardly terrorist attack that killed many innocent people.

In response, Israel has acted like the US did after 9/11 and has attacked Palestine relentlessly. 

Since then, I've seen a large population of left leaning and LGBTQ+ people supporting Palestine, as well as rightist nazi 4channers. This confounds me. I expect the nazi 4channer types to support Hamas because they hate jews and Israel, but the other side confuses me.

My understanding is a large amount of palestinians support the terrorist attack, and also a lot of muslims hate LGBTQ+ people and would kill them if they could.

So I don't understand how anyone part of those communities could support people who hate them and would kill them, just because Israel is taking revenge.

I feel like if you do a terrorist attack, you're now in the ""find out"" phase of the ""fuck around and find out"" phase.

Looking for some perspective on why so many leftists support Hamas/Palestine on this. What do they honestly expect Israel to do in response to this attack? If the attack leads to Israel bending the knee, wouldn't that encourage more muslim terrorists to attack Israel? they can't afford to look weak.

I'm open to having my view changed but I do strongly think it's foolish and a case of ""living in an ivory tower"" if you're part of these communities and pledge your support of Palestine/Hamas.",fexterslab,825,3365,0.6100000143051147,0.6561908368042408,1699114064,/r/changemyview/comments/17now0j/cmv_leftistslgbtq_people_who_support_palestine/,2023,11

From hearing about the working conditions of his employees to the unhinged shit he says and does online I just don't like him. He comes off as a pseudointellectual developmentally stunted man-child, and every time I hear about him I like him less. 

I also see him as arrogant. He can't even manufacture his cars that aren't riddled with production errors, and he wants to put chips in people's brains. With the way he's handled twitter, I think that this is also a disaster waiting to happen. He says he's vehemently against censorship, but that really only applies when it supports his agenda.

1858lk8,CMV: Not voting for Biden in 2024 as a left leaning person is bad political calculus,"Biden's handling of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts has encouraged many left-leaning people to affirm that they won't be voting for him in the general election in 2024. Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively.

Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest.

To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.

To assist, while I wouldn't dismiss anything outright, the following points are ones I would have a really hard time buying into:

- Accelerationism
- Both parties are the same or insufficiently different
- Third parties are viable in the general election",baroquespoon,1615,1597,0.7400000095367432,0.5430510866195601,1701106663,/r/changemyview/comments/1858lk8/cmv_not_voting_for_biden_in_2024_as_a_left/,2023,11

17ma6nr,"CMV: The ""Mediocre White Man"" idea that some on the left like to promote is toxic, divisive and, if enough people buy into it, outright dangerous","This CMV is partly inspired by a conversation I saw on Reddit a couple of weeks ago where a male user was repeatedly putting himself down and a female user was not exactly doing anything to disabuse him of the notion that he's some sort of failure. 

It was upsetting to see somebody who, based on the comments, really hadn't done anything bash themselves over and over again for not being good enough. And this is by no means the first time I've seen this behavior. I think many on the left see it as a good thing, that if society can shake white men's core sense of self they'll be open to learning about other perspectives. 

I think the opposite is true. I think people who have no core sense of self who believe they are mediocre over all because of societal messaging are the most dangerous, and the most likely to lash out and hurt others.

18624kk,CMV: far-right Muslim extremist organizations like Hamas should be treated the same way we treat far-right Christian extremist organizations.,"Progressive intersectionality has been a net asset for many causes including the struggle of oppressed minorities, women, LGBT groups, etc...

However, in recent times, it has lost its focus by trying to include supporting far-right religious extremists such as Hamas, a terrorist organization, all in the name of intersectionality.

It is mind-blogging that many progressive activists to this day still refuse to condemn Hamas' rape, torture, and beheading of innocent civilians. Some even go so far as to deny that rape and gender-based violence even took place.

**It shouldn't be difficult to stand with innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians while still condemning Hamas' terrorist attacks.**

If a Christian Copt Terror group in Egypt, started to rape, torture, and behead innocent Muslim civilians in the name of Jesus Christ, you can be sure that these same progressive activists would condemn them.

They would ignore the context of the oppression that the Copt minority has suffered at the hands of Egypt's Muslim majority Government and instead, they would only focus on ""Christians killing Muslims"".

But when Muslims kill Jewish people or Christians, many progressive activists refuse to condemn Hamas all in the name of intersectionality.

17q0cl6,CMV: There is no compelling reason to be angry about diversity in media,"Do you ever see those articles or videos of people complaining about ""wokeness"" in media, but they never quite describe what that is? Based on the context, it sounds like they're just complaining about diversity. I think more diversity is a good thing, because the world is diverse. That's just reality.  
  
I love the show Friends, but I'm going to pick on it a bit just as an example. It takes place in New York, and all the main characters are straight white people. Almost all the supporting characters are white people. It isn't very realistic in its portrayal of New York, because the city in reality is not 99% white people.  
  
My point is-- having more diversity makes sense and is more of a good thing than a bad thing. It's a net positive.  
  
Now let's look at some of the arguments these people make:  
  
**""Executives are forcing diversity just to pander.""**  
  
Probably. But executives have always pandered. Their job is to appeal to people in order to maximize profit. Why zero in on diversity as the main cause of this? It's a broader issue of studios chasing the dollar. At least in this case, the result of having more diversity isn't really a bad thing.  
  
**""They sacrifice good writing for diversity.""**  
  
Once again, these are two separate things. I agree that telling a good story should be the focus. Why would diversity have anything to do with this? Why pick out diversity as the thing that is making movies forget to tell a good story? There have always been poorly written movies long before diversity was encouraged.  
  
**""They make unnecessary changes to things we love.""**  
  
Anytime something is brought back for a reboot or new adaptation, there are going to be changes. Not all of these changes will be strictly ""necessary"". As long as you don't have an attitude of being resistant to all change, I don't see why changing something just to be more diverse is a bad thing. Why not instead just blame the changes that actually harm the story and characters? A minor change like a character having a different skin color does not sound harmful to me. It sounds like a very minor change.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
To bring it all together, let's suppose they rebooted Friends with entirely new actors playing the same characters. And none of the acting was good. And they changed the race of one of the the main characters. And the writing was terrible. What would you think of all this? What would you mention in a critical review of it?  
  
I would think rebooting it in the first place is a completely unnecessary cash grab. I would be irritated by how bad the writing is. And I would point out how the new portrayals are not nearly as good as the original cast. So I'd have a lot of criticisms of the reboot, but none of this has anything to do with diversity or being ""woke"". If they decided to make Rachel black, I wouldn't care that the character was black. I would care that the new actor doesn't do as good of a job as Jennifer Aniston.  
  
Am I missing something? Where does this anger towards diversity come from?",Hal87526,1022,1494,0.6800000071525574,0.41547840010622294,1699380369,/r/changemyview/comments/17q0cl6/cmv_there_is_no_compelling_reason_to_be_angry/,2023,11

184bs54,"CMV: creationism should not be taught in public schools at all, even alongside evolution.","I was watching the Simpsons episode where they start teaching creationism alongside (later instead of) evolution in Springfield elementary. It was goofy, but while watching I remembered that my high school did the exact same thing. I went to a decently well-funded public school in the Midwest during the early 21st century. 

At the time I didn’t care all that much, I was raised Christian but I was always a curious kid so I already knew about and believed in evolution. Actually, I did care a little bit because, while on the debate team, I *lost* a debate regarding whether creationism should be taught in schools. So maybe you could say the episode reminded me of some embarrassing high school moments. 

I agree with the Simpsons: creationism should *not* be taught in school because there is no scientific merit to the book of Genesis. Schools are institutions of science and evolution is science. Churches are where children should learn about creationism and how religion squares with our contemporary world. 

Still, as an adult I don’t care all that much, so my opinion can still be subject to change. I lost the debate arguing that creationism should *not* be taught in public schools, so obviously there are valid arguments as to why creationism *should* be taught in schools. 

I should also note, I chose the words in the title carefully. Creationism should not be taught *at all.* In my school it was an option, you could learn about evolution and creationism in tandem. I’m taking a rather extreme position that creationism shouldn’t be taught at all. So maybe change my view so that I can see the merit of teaching them both and giving the option for students. Or change my view that creationism should be taught instead of the evolution hoax.

186p36m,CMV: a Trump 2024 presidency would irreversibly alter United States politics & partisanship as we know it,"Loaded post, I know and this is a bit heady, but please let me explain. I’m from the Midwest and Trump supporters are everywhere. They frequently claim that Trump is being hit with “political” legal attacks during these court cases. They claim this like they’re saying something outrageous. They also act like Trump wouldn’t do the exact same thing against his opponents, or worse if re-elected. 

First off, obviously the cases against trump are completely political. He’s the former president, and I don’t see any republican plaintiffs. However, when I mention politics, I’m looking past the superficial ideological divide and I’m analyzing the actual mechanics and science behind “power” and mass influence. The study of politics is just that, the discipline studying the application of power and exercise of authority. Any system with more than one individual is political because there will be a power imbalance. There cannot be two chefs cooking the same meal unless one delegates. This is power and its political. 

In my view, systems of power become contentious when you have powerful individuals supported by other powerful people, institutions, or undifferentiated masses. Such as a political party. 

Trump is currently being tried for many different alleged violations, both civil and criminal. Trump was a former and recent president of the United States. This dynamic is completely unprecedented in the balance of Anglo-American politics. Trump could have murdered 3 people with a knife on camera and admitted to it and prosecution of him would still be political. It’s inescapable that the act of exercising government power against trump in the form of judicial oversight is an act of political power. It’s irrelevant how much or how little Biden, or any democrat, has to do with any prosecution. Its political no matter what.  Submission to any court and its laws, under any circumstances, is a recognition of political sovereignty. The very act of Trump, an important political figure, being accused and called to answer for his crimes is political. 

Therefore, if Trump somehow wins in 2024, as a felon or otherwise, it is unthinkable that he would be able to restrain himself from challenging the political systems that tried to hold him accountable in the first place. Even if he wanted to restrain himself. Again, it’s politics, if he is in power he will exercise it, his supporters would command him to do so regardless, right? Given the inherent political nature of the proceedings against him, it seems obvious to me that Trump would use government power to do something equally political. 

Since the nation is already in uncharted waters trying to prosecute a former, contentious president, if Trump wins in 2024, there is an incredibly likely chance that Trump would respond in kind and legally prosecute his enemies or otherwise exercise political power in ways unseen in American political history. 

This post is a prediction, one that I feel many Trump supporters are either ignoring or they want it to happen. Either way change my view and make it easier for me to live in TrumpTown and not be so cynical of US politics. Please poke holes in my appraisal of the situation. Please give me a reason to change my view and expect a boring election cycle in 2024. 

TL;DR: Trump is being accused of felonies and other crimes. Political or not, it’s all politics and it’s unthinkable that if re-elected, convict or otherwise, Trump will launch legal actions against his perceived enemies and a dramatic political battle, unprecedented in scope and scale, will erupt if he wins 2024.",Ok-Story-9319,1024,1186,0.7300000190734863,0.37009181424704607,1701263573,/r/changemyview/comments/186p36m/cmv_a_trump_2024_presidency_would_irreversibly/,2023,11

There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.","Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of ""status quo"" or ""inertia."" We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one.

17zz6u2,"CMV: Only Individuals, NOT limited liability entities, should be allowed to legally own real property zoned for single families.","There has been a housing crisis in the United States since the turn of the century. The damn broke in 2008 when large financial institutions violently awoke the nation from her American dream of homeownership. There has been a wealth “crisis” developing since the turn of the 19th century where individual wealth has depleted while corporately owned wealth has skyrocketed. Even the richest billionaire is but a worthless pauper compared to average multinational corporations. These two crises are related. The monumental wealth of large enterprises and the increasing poverty of the bourgeoisie has caused the prospect of owning a parcel of the planet earth ever more illusory each decade. 

We almost forget that *American* society exists to protect the citizen against the collective. This is *not* a socialist state, the rights of the individual are paramount against the rights of the group or the state. The citizen serves themselves, the citizen does not serve the state nor the corporation. To paraphrase, the Declaration of Independence holds that once a government no longer permits the citizen to live and die according to their means and abilities, the government must be dissolved by any means necessary. 

I am not saying that the US ought to collapse because of modern social inequalities like many radicals on the far left/right. Instead, I think a sensible solution to the dual problems of inequality and the lack of owned real properties is a simple change in national policy. It should be law across every jurisdiction that areas zoned for “single-family” homes can only be sold to individuals born of woman. No entities may own real property zoned like this, unless such an entity exposes their owners to unlimited liability. 

I mention all the stuff about American culture/law to undermine the argument that prohibiting corporations from purchasing would violate the “freedom” of a corporation to engage in the market. Individuals have freedoms under the Constitution, and individuals may associate freely. But such associations should not have the same claim to rights/freedoms that individuals have. This argument is unavailing because society serves the individual, not the collective. 

Another counterargument I can imagine is that the economy might suffer because (1) housing prices are inflated; (2) the only entities that can reliably pay inflated prices with ready cash (or favorable financing) are corporate entities; and (3) if the wealthiest entities in the market are banned from buying, housing prices would dramatically collapse. Last time housing prices collapsed, Obama had to give billions to banking executives lest their feelings got hurt. /s (kinda). To this argument, I say the ends would justify the means. Billions in home equity would evaporate so that future generations could have a justifiable hope in affordable home ownership. 

TL;DR: Perpetuating the American dream for current and future generations of homebuyers is more important than big business profit and the retirement plans of current homeowners. Therefore business should be unilaterally banned from owning single-family owned property, any business currently owning such property should divest ASAP.",Ok-Story-9319,1134,741,0.9200000166893005,0.32479541665799294,1700514881,/r/changemyview/comments/17zz6u2/cmv_only_individuals_not_limited_liability/,2023,11
17tpxj8,"CMV: Most people who say that the education system in America doesn't teach you any ""real life skills"" just aren't good students and don't put any effort into school","Just to preface I am talking about high school in America here.

First of all, if high schools actually taught classes like taxes and personal financial literacy nobody would pay attention anyways. Second of all most people don't understand that subjects like math and science are like weightlifting for your brain. When do you ever see a football player ever do a squat on the field? Never, but doing squats builds up a level of strength in the legs that is vital to being a good football player. Same thing with school. You'll so often hear that ""ill never use algebra in the real world"" when the whole point is that you learn how to problem solve and also understand concepts and put them to work. English is an important subject because having good grammar and being a good writer is important no matter what. Thirdly you'll hear people say ""oh school is designed to made us into complacent workers who follow orders"" and this just isn't true. It's really not a crazy thing to expect kids to listen to their teachers and follow simple instructions (Which you have to do in the real world no matter what your job is)

My main gripe with the education system is that public schools in America do not pay the good teachers enough so any good teacher has no incentive to stay at a public school when they can go to a private school. The material we teach is 100% the right stuff.",ElectroFalcon34,1203,623,0.8299999833106995,0.3203252178893469,1699812666,/r/changemyview/comments/17tpxj8/cmv_most_people_who_say_that_the_education_system/,2023,11
180kyd2,CMV: I don't think the Marvels failed because moviegoers are sexist and racist,"As somebody who enjoys writing, I can empathize with the director Nia DaCosta. I would be heartbroken if a story I'd poured blood, sweat, and tears into was shunned by so many people and, going by any metric, the Marvels has failed to attract audiences. 

Nia DaCosta herself did an interview in which she said ""There are pockets that are really virulent and violent and racist — and sexist and homophobic and all those awful things. And I choose the side of the light. That’s the part of fandom I’m most attracted to."" I don't think it's fair to interpret that as her saying superhero fans in general are these things or the movie failed because of these things as some people are. 

But there are others who are convinced bigotry is responsible for the failure of ""The Marvels"" or at least primarily responsible. Based on the data I've seen, I don't think this is the case. It's true that white people and men didn't turn out in large numbers which could suggest bigotry was a major factor. But nobody else did either. 

So why did the Marvels perform poorly? In my view...

The Marvels itself does not score particularly well with critics. This is probably the biggest factor. A movie can have legs if it gets good word of mouth from viewers and critics. Elemental is a great example. Bombed initially, but came roaring back. The A cinema score no doubt helped it. And elemental touched on racism and discrimination too. 

Due to the strikes there was limited press

There's a lot of superhero fatigue. I personally couldn't make it through more than 15 minutes of part 1 of avengers endgame. 

These all seem like more logical explanations than rampant racism and sexism. CMV",ICuriosityCatI,818,1070,0.7200000286102295,0.3138551800305278,1700584125,/r/changemyview/comments/180kyd2/cmv_i_dont_think_the_marvels_failed_because/,2023,11
17zm3f0,CMV: people that don't opt-in for organs donation should go bottom of the list when it comes to become recipients,"This post is on the back of yesterday's post about how the default for organs donation should be opt-in and people should explicitly state that they want ot opt-out.

I was quite shocked at how many replies were against it, some people talked about ""tricking"" people, I'm not sure why, informative campaign could be done, is not some complex concept that the average person in the street can't understand. Also I'm not going into the debate on why people would rather have their organs rot in the ground instead of helping a fellow human being, but here's a proposal that I think would reconcile these views:

We keep the system as it is, but if you don't opt-in as an organ donor you go to the bottom of the list if you ever need one. Here are some points that got me to this idea:

* We already give priorities to organ recipients: age, medical history, etc (basically chances of survival) are already taken into consideration when lists are compiled, it's not just first come first served.
* It totally respects individual freedom
* It incentivize much needed organs donation  
* it's fair to people that opted in 

Just to reiterate: I'm not saying that people that are not organ donors DON'T get an organ ever, only that they get a lower score compared to people that opted-in, that's only fair, if you think your organs are too precious to donate even when you're dead, surely you can't expect others to do any differently. Otherwise you're just an HYPOCRITE. It's all about FAIRNESS. 

Now, I'm bias to the argument, my other half has received a kidney and is one of those things that people that haven't been through can't understand what it means to see a loved one getting sick, going through dialysis, going through the long process of getting into a recipient list and finally the long wait. 

Final couple of points: 

I'm sure there're super rare occasions where my POV may create some contradictions, we can discuss them and (as a society) find a solution, I don't believe in discarding good ideas just because they are not so good in the 0.1% of cases.   
Different countries have different protocols for organ donation/transplant. So pointing why it wouldn't work due to a specific law/regulation is a bit of a weak argument. I believe in principle every modern democratic country could implement this idea.

17v10la,CMV: Trump’s odds of winning in 2024 are significantly overstated in betting markets (currently a 50/50 on predictit),"I feel that giving trump 50/50 odds of winning the 2024 presidential election is overly generous. 

Ever since Trump initially won in 2016, Republicans have failed to win at a national level. 2018 was considered a disappointment for them, trump lost in 2020, 2022 “red wave” never materialized, and now suddenly we’re supposed to believe that 2024 will turn things around. 

For Trump to win, he needs to pick up 3 of the 6 below states- 

- Georgia
- Wisconsin
- Arizona
- Pennsylvania
- Michigan
- Nevada

Georgia went blue because of the growth of Atlanta, which has only continued to grow. The population has gone up by 300,000 people since 2020. The whole j6 and Georgia lawsuits has only served to hurt Trump’s image in that state. I consider his odds of flipping that state very poor considering his position is weaker than the last time he lost.

I consider his odds to win in Pennsylvania incredibly poor, considering how his endorsement of Oz couldn’t beat a disabled candidate in the senate. PA is getting bluer. 

Michigan is a lost cause for the GOP considering how Tudor Dixon performed there. 

I almost didn’t include Nevada in this list because it has always felt like a stretch for the trump campaign. It’s a state that has very slowly started to shift red, but Trump needs to find 30,000 votes to flip there in 24 to win it and I don’t see where they will come from. 

Arizona is like 60/40 for Biden because of the continued growth of Phoenix and the unpopularity of trump there due to his arduous history with John McCain. 

And finally there’s Wisconsin, which was incredibly close and I guess he could win in 24. They had a winning gop race I recently. To be nice to him, let’s say that one is 60/40 for trump.

So that’s 1 state that he is 60/40 likely win (Wisconsin), 1 where he’s a 60/40 on the losing end (Arizona), and 4 where I consider his chance of victory to be very poor. I’ll assign them 25% chances of winning each. 

Plugging those odds into a calculator online, I see that his odds of winning would really be 11.27%, rather than 50/50. 

I believe that my estimates make sense given the current environment and issues like abortion making republicans have a very difficult uphill battle with voters. I’d be curious as to things I’m missing with my estimates that would require I shift my view.

1) national debt. American interest is at ...like almost a trillion dollars today. That didn't just ""happen"", obviously ""hey do you want to borrow money somebody else will have to pay""... who says ""no"", right? not america or canada. 

2) constantly increasing minimum wage throughout their working life, while engaging in free trade deals to make it easy to outsource work for cheap products. then, engaging in mass immigration because foreign workers will accept jobs for passports that kids just wont do that cheap.

3) underfunding education once they or their own kids had graduated. They increased class size, started giving university spots to foreign students, and allowing raising tuition to make it less accessible/more daunting. they also removed or reduced public childcare programs in many places.

4) sending cities and other governments into debt with spending that increases the value of their land,    and not raising property taxes like other taxes.

5) the bailout. measures to keep their investments and economic predictions and pension on track, at the expense of everyone else.

My place of work has recently been running workshops on ""anti-racism"". I myself have been trying to engage with it as much as I can to try and better myself. 

One aspect that I find difficult is the idea that racism has to have a power inbalance. In my own country (the UK) a white person cannot experience racism as they hold more structural power. They can be *discriminated* against but that is not racism. 

I find this idea difficult for two main reasons:

1. I always thought and was taught growing up that racism is where you disciminate based off of the colour of someones skin. In that definition, a white person can experience racism. The white person may not be harmed as much by it, but it is still discriminating agaist someone based on their race. 
2. In my place of work (a school), we have to often deal with racist incidents. One of the most common so far this year is racist remarks from black students towards asian ones. Is this racism? I can't confidently decide who has the greater power imbalance! 

I promise that this is coming from a place of good faith!

17ugk46,CMV: The majority of people who think the economy is doing poorly dont understand inflation and the process of getting it under control and instead think they would be better off in a recession,"A large percentage of people currently believe that Biden is doing terrible on the economy, largely due to inflation and difficulty affording things. I think that is entirely because they do not have an understanding of what inflation actually is and dont realize that this is, in fact, the ideal scenario. 

When Biden was inaugurated, inflation was at 7.7% and is currently down to 3.7%. While still elevated, this is a remarkable improvement and the fact that we are slowly approaching the ideal rate of 2% without entering a recession and having people continued to be employed is remarkable. I think, what people dont understand, is that inflation is cumulative and the numbers will never go back down without major things happening and I would like to use the example of food to illustrate this. There are two things that will cause the price of food to largely return to where it was, either a technological breakthrough that doubles yields (not happening) or, the more likely scenario, a drastic decrease in demand because people are out of work and are no longer able to afford anything because the economy is in a recession. I think this later scenario is what many are naively arguing for! 

In addition, I dont think they really understood the 3 paths that we were facing at that time. The first path was runaway inflation, second path was slowly decreasing the inflation rate to 2%, and the third path was entering into a recession. I think we are currently on this middle path and seem to be doing it really well, but if you look at posts all over reddit, people will say, ""the economy isnt doing great, I can barely afford my rent and groceries when I used to be able to"". I am not saying that isnt true, but they dont realize that that is the goal. Would they rather we have entered into runaway inflation? Would they rather have lost their job and not be able to afford rent at all but at least the rent in their area hasnt increased?

It sounds elitist sure, but I strongly believe that it’s true. Popular sovereignty is a nice idea, but an extremely bad one. Literacy tests were certainly abused during the Jim Crow era, but they have well-founded reasoning behind them. 

Demagoguery can really only occur if the population is ignorant enough to believe that the would-be tyrant isn’t lying; or that history repeats itself. 

Take Trump for example. Those who haven’t read primary sources reflecting the rise of the German National Socialist Party might not see the parallels between American populism and German populism. Or at worst, people might not even know what populism is. 

From a policy perspective, the ignorant might think a bunch of government stimulus is a good thing and will never have any negative consequences. Whereas anyone who took high school economics could tell you that inflation will rise as a direct consequence of free money injected into consumer wallets.

I often hear the idea that certain groups of people have the inherent right to any group of land because ""they were there first"", and I hear this regarding many groups like native Americans, the Jewish state, or others.

But the reality is that nobody has any inherent right to a piece of land. Maps are drawn through war, and territory belongs to whichever group can conquer it. Some people may be forgetting that because the borders of western nations haven't been redrawn for a while.

Just as the Comanche conquered land in America's southern territory and took it from the Apache, the American government conducted a series of wars against the native Americans and took land from them.

Japan used to be numerous states but a man by the name of Oda Nobunaga led a series of conquests in order to unite Japan into a single nation. He died, but his goal was fulfilled by some other individuals.

We see the same thing happening right now in Ukraine. If Russia can take it then it's their territory. But Ukraine seems to be quite capable in defending themselves, so they get to keep ownership of the territory. And the same thing is happening in Gaza right now. If Hamas can defend the territory then they can keep it, but otherwise they might lose it.

This might sound insensitive but this is just the way the world works and is how it has always worked. Your right to a piece of property is upheld by the laws of your country. The laws are upheld by the government, and the Sovereignty of the government is upheld by the military establishment. Even countries without militaries are defended by (other) militaries.

17xur4t,CMV: Vegan “leather” is dumb,"Alright first off I would like to make it clear that this is not an attack on veganism; its a noble cause to minimize the suffering of animals but vegan leather in particular is a terrible alternative. Although I am not vegan because meat tastes too good.

Firstly its simply lower quality that real leather.
Leather fibrous structure is much more durable than faux, leading it to last longer. Even if its for something that doesn't need to be resilient, leather patinas beautifully as it ages, while faux just breaks down and cracks. Because of this vegan leather is replaced more often than produced more waste.

Not only does faux create more waste but it also is much worse for the environment. Leather is biodegradable because it obviously comes from animals. 90% of vegan leather is made of plastic which cant say the same. There are some alternative vegan leathers made of cactus and other stuff but they are uncommon and still mixed with synthetic materials which also do not biodegrade.

So vegan leather produces more waste, and is more environmentally taxing but at least its free from animal suffering right? Well yes, but you can make an argument that leather is too. Almost all leather is a biproduct of the meat industry, meaning cows aren't being killed for their hides. If we all stopped buying leather it wouldn't have a major effect on the quantity of cows being slaughtered, we'd just use less of the cows. I view it like the Native Americans and the buffalo. To show respect for the buffalo they used everything. Nothing went to waste. Their hide is better as a pair of boots than rotting in a landfill.

I think the porn industry is exploitative as hell. I think using porn on a daily basis is bad for your mental health and how you view relationships with people.

I definitely see the ethical concerns with porn consumption itself.

What bothers me is the insecurity people have with it.

I view myself as an inherently non-jealous person. It takes an awful lot for someone to make me jealous with my partner.

I think, I could see myself getting jealous if my boyfriend was getting nudes from another girl directly or sex tapes.

I can't understand why being interested in seeing another person naked would be an issue for someone. Isn't that just biology? Especially for men who are much more visual.

I think that having to shut that off to cater to a partner's insecurities is unreasonable. It's like asking someone to become asexual for anyone but you.

I genuinely don't understand. I've seen so many people talk about their partner's pornography use or even finding other people attractive on social media and becoming jealous over it.

Why is it ok to cater to that insecurity? Isn't that unhealthy in a relationship?

I also think men have different biological urges than women. Like, alot of men will get physically uncomfortable if they go too long without ejaculating. If they don't do it while awake, they'll do it in your sleep. I view it as a regulation like peeing or pooping, and porn just making it simpler.

I think it becomes an issue when it interferes with your sex life or you expect your partner to fill the void pornography does for you.

Now to be clear, I am not saying people of a race are not good at voicing certain races or their own race. Rather, I am arguing that we are making quality less of a priority. And to illustrate this, let me entertain two scenarios:  
1. A white voice actor is chosen to voice a person of color because they are better at voicing the \*\*character\*\*, than the voice actor who is of the same race of the character, \*\*but\*\* is not as suited to the character as the people making the content desire.  
2. A \*\*non-white\*\* and \*\*non-Japanese\*\* voice actor, is chosen to voice a \*\*Japanese\*\* character in an anime, even though the character is not their race, because their voice acting ability is better suited to that character than the available Japanese voice actors who are the character's race, but not as suited for that character.  
I support both of these scenarios for being reality, because in both cases the \*quality\* of the persons ability to voice the character is what took priority. If the voice actor is chosen for a character who is also of their race, it should be because they had the talent to voice a character, who is not just defined by their skin but their way talking, the \*personality\* of their voice, which the actor was able to bring out better than other actors. Not because they were the same race as that character.  
Now I also made the claim in my view that the narrative has the potential to \*backfire\* on the people promoting it. And to explain it quite simply I need only point out that the people promoting these views... A themselves voicing characters not of their race. I don't even mean voicing non-human-like characters. I mean human beings or human equivalent characters who are of a certain race/ethnicity, being represented by voice actors who are not that race/ethnicity.  
For example:  
Mr SungWon Cho. Ethnicity: Korean.  A prominent promoter of this narrative.  
His roles include:  
Vice Admiral Legrange - Anglo-French ([86](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24481))  
Kajinosuke Tanikaze - Japanese ([Records of Ragnarok](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24643))  
Koutaro Tatsumi - Japanese ([The Honor Student at Magic High School](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=23898))  
This nice video reel of his roles [on his Twitter (X) account](https://twitter.com/i/status/1717961644331208749). Plenty of non-Asian, let alone non-Korean roles there  
Ms Shakyra Dunn. Ethnicity: Black as per her twitter. An example I wish to put forward of who this would backfire on.  
Her roles are all compiled her by herself which saved me a lot of trouble:  
[On her instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx5yR18uKwW/)  
Now if we were to apply this narrative upon them, then they would have to relinquish a great number of roles, not because they can't voice them well, but because they are not the same race/ethnicity. And I am willing to bet that a good number of the voice actors who promote this narrative would also lose a large portion of their roles, because they do not fit the race of the character. In other words, it would backfire on them.  
The only way to avoid this backfiring would be to make exceptions and compromises. To say ""Oh well but this is different...."". No if we are going to go with this, then we need to go all the way. If this narrative is going to dominate voice acting then everyone should face the consequences that come with it, regardless of their race. And that would be the biggest backfire for the entire voice acting community for what I believe is absolute nonsense.  
It would reduce voice acting to be a race based profession first and talent based profession second. The mighty Kratos from God of War (Norse) is voiced by Christopher Judge, a man who has my favorite voice for Kratos in the series. But Kratos is Greek. And since voice acting is supposed to be done by the matching race.. Oh well I guess Christopher loses his job huh?  
I hope I have properly illustrated my view. And hope to see if anyone can find a way to change my view. You may change it by convincing me that voice acting should be about race first and talent second and that this would not backfire on the people promoting it.",Delusional_Gamer,805,324,0.8799999952316284,0.200547037149353,1699421910,/r/changemyview/comments/17qex82/cmv_the_narrative_that_a_voice_actor_should_only/,2023,11
17zdr3r,CMV: There is no reasonable justification for the incredibly high civilian death toll in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war,"I’ve been watching the conflict unfold, as many of us have, with horror at what seems to be a conflict that either primarily hurts, or primarily targets, Gazan civilians. Civilian deaths primarily seem to come from the direct targeting of civilian infrastructure, including refugee camps, apartment buildings, hospitals, schools, mosques, and even evacuation convoys. 

Each time a civilian target is hit, the general IDF justification seems to be that Hamas was using civilians as human shields. However, frequently the IDF will either claim they were targeting only a single Hamas fighter in an attack that was obviously bound to kill scores of civilians (the first attack on the Jabalia Refugee Camp, for instance), and/or there are no Hamas casualties substantiated after the attack, either by the IDF or by human rights orgs (Amnesty International lists a number of prominent attacks that seemed to have no discernable political targets: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/damning-evidence-of-war-crimes-as-israeli-attacks-wipe-out-entire-families-in-gaza/#:~:text=As%20Israeli%20forces%20continue%20to,be%20investigated%20as%20war%20crimes).

Seeing this, I’ve generally come to the conclusion that:

1. Israel is either willing to accept extreme, easily avoidable or unnecessary civilian casualties to kill individual Hamas fighters or 
2. Targeting civilians is actually an intentional part of Israeli military strategy in this conflict 

I will also note that these casualties dont exactly seem to be producing successful mission outcomes: the command center in Al Shifa seems to be nonexistent, and  the number of Hamas fighters killed seems to be quite low for the carnage so far (I think the IDF claimed around 1000 last time I checked?). The hostages are also, mostly, still without a safe guarantee of coming home.

In the end, none of this seems justifiable to me. 

However, I realize that there are many people out there who feel strongly that the war is necessary, justified, and even good. I want to challenge myself and try to see things from a side that, right now, seems very difficult for me to understand.

183xayy,"cmv: When people say 'white', they mean 'white North American'.","Disclaimer: This doesn't really affect North American people. This post is centered around a Eurpean perspective, and so it might be confusing to some of you. 


I live in Germany as an immigrant, and I have friends from all across the world. I am European. 

Across the bank, the majority of friends I have met that were from outside of Europe had a very specific set of prejudices against me, that never really bothered me too much and just calmly explained this was not a thing in my country. 

I have noticed, however, that some things always repeated although being absolutely absurd. Here are some examples of the things I have been told/ were expected of me. 

1) Not seasoning food

- I am Italian. We have very simple cuisine but it's good. The same friends who tell me this about ""white people"" love my cooking and ask for my recipes/ to make their favourite dish again. 

2) Not having an own culture

- A friend of mine said something along the lines of ""White people appropriate other cultures and festivities because they don't really have their own"". I believe we were talking about Dia de los Muertos in that regard. But all European countries have their own very different cultures. 

In general, I don't think ""black culture"" and ""white culture"" apply to Europe the same way they do to the US. While there may be an african american culture across the U.S., my Ethiopian friend and my Tanzanian friend have just as little in common as a Russian and a Spanish person. They don't share one culture, they each have their own, which may overlap in some parts of life. 

3) My culture was never oppressed

I come from a part of Italy that used to have it's own language and traditions. When Italy was formed in the 19th century, people were forced to stop having their own customs and speaking their own language, or call themselves anything other than Italians. 

My grandparents still spoke the language, but I was never allowed to. I was expected to behave like an Italian so that I would have better chances in life and people would not know my background, which was considered lesser. 

I am not an exception. There are many ethnic groups in Europe that are considered white and still suffered oppression and sometimes persecution. I hate to see these stories devalued by someone saying a blanket statement.

4) This is silly, but the sandal

""White people will never understand how scary it is when your mother picks up the sandal"". But we do have the sandal in Italy. And when I pointed this out, I was told that that was cultural appropriation. 

5) Beige

""White people love to have their walls painted beige and all interior decor has to be beige.""

This was just yesterday. I talked about how houses in my region are not like that at all. And then I thought about it and described how Swedish houses are not like that. Nor are russian houses. Or French ones. Or Spanish ones. Or German ones, at that. Even my German friend, who initially agreed (in shame) that all white houses were just beige, did so while sitting in her perfectly colourful apartment with no beige in sight. I asked her if she had ever seen such a beige home in real life. She has not. Neither had anyone else, when we thought about it. 

To be honest, I don't even think most American white people live like that. I think it's just a social media fad. 



And that brings me to the reason why I am here:

As much as I am not upset at people when they make assumptions, it can be tiring when you hear the same things over and over again. I am upset that European people have to be culturally associated with North America just because we look similar, even though culturally we are so far apart. Social media paints a picture where every white person is from a Florida suburb, and people choose to believe it.

I’m 31m, been single a few years til about 6 months ago, met 32f who is perfect on every metric.

Except. Shes very eager to have kids. Is the only child of her parents so is the only chance of them having grandkids, and her friends all have kids she’s a godmother 3 times already.

My view of kids has always been “if I have to”, and when I met my partner I said “I’ll imagine I’ll have them some day”. And I told her this as well, quoting every single person I know with children saying “it’s the best decision of your life, you’ll never know stronger love etc etc.”

So we’ve started visiting her friends with kids, and my nieces and nephews, and tbh Reddit I’m looking at my watch every minute. I’m seeing the destroyed houses and the dirty faces and the screaming and climbing and smells and tantrums and CONSTANT CHATTER and if anything I’m less enthused.
My reasoning:
1) the world is over populated, there doesn’t need to be more children.
2) I shouldn’t have kids just to have someone to look after me in my old age.
3) I’m loving the fact I can do whatever I want whenever I want within my work schedule/budget, I don’t want to give this up.
4) Financially it’s over 100k to raise a kid, money I could put towards my retirement/home.
5) I’m not even a pet person let alone a kid person.
6) My parents already have grandkids, I’m not obligated to provide more.
7) I just do not have the patience

Caveat though, if I were to have a kid, there’s no one I’d want to have a kid with more than my current partner. She’s wonderful, she’d make a great mum and I’d never be sick of her. Part of me will concede to the kid just so we don’t break up.

Soo it falls to you Reddit. Would love a response that counterpoints my view above.

Please don’t give me platitudes: “ it’ll be different when it’s your own” and for the love of the divine I don’t need “hey man if you don’t wanna have kids you don’t have to, tell your partner it’s unfair” I KNOW.
I’m looking to have my view changed. I WANT to want to have kids I just don’t.

17mtqet,CMV: the United States government should pay teachers similar to military service members relative to experience and education,"I served in the US Army and my final rank was Sergeant (E5). I am currently a math teacher with a MS in Math plus an additional 30 graduate credit hours and 14 years of teaching experience. 

My current salary is $68,000 and I live in a rural area in Northern Georgia. While cost of living is low here, I can't help but look up what my pay would had been had I stayed in the military - even if I stay as E5, with my wife and kid, my base pay plus BAH would put me at around the same as my current salary, without the degrees and I am not even counting my qualifiers that would net higher pay. 

Both teachers and military are performing vital public services, so why is pay gap this enormous? Objectively, my job in the Army was far easier - I only need to focus on my mission and manage fewer than 5 personnel who have to complete basic training/AIT, so in a sense, self-selected. Whereas as a teacher, I am responsible for the learning outcome of 30+ young people who often do not want to be here.

I have to complete 6 years of higher education in STEM program to even get started in my teaching career for my current pay track (I would get paid even less if I only have a BS) plus it took me years in teaching before I firmly grasp the craft of education; whereas I enlisted in the Army when I was 17 with just a HS diploma, promoted to E5 after 2 years in services (I joined as E3 due to JROTC, received a waiver for E4 at 18 months TIS, then promoted to E5 in secondary zone), I know that is a bit faster than most, but I didn't really need to have much qualifications for my enlistment and promotions. 

As an E5, I was highly expendable. I get it that recruitment number are low but someone else could have easily done replaced me. Yet, as a math teacher, it is next to impossible for me to be replaced. Our department have been operating with 
 less than 75% faculty due to multiple people leaving within the past few years and we simply failed to attract new hires. As of the past 4 years, I am the only person in my department who is qualified to teach Statistics, all of us are teaching more students, committing more tutoring hours... The point is, the military recruitment shortage isn't due to low pay, but teacher shortage is.

My view is that Americans should commit to paying teachers just as much as paying military service members, after all, one cannot function without another.",JianJiaHei,479,576,0.8299999833106995,0.17627227067958523,1699013799,/r/changemyview/comments/17mtqet/cmv_the_united_states_government_should_pay/,2023,11

17wrmkj,"CMV: If they are all equally humanely (or inhumanely) killed, there is nothing that makes the consumption of cat meat, dog meat, horse meat, dolphin meat, etc. any more or less moral than the consumption of pork, poultry, beef, fish or mutton.","As someone once said, ""People get outraged about dolphins being caught in tuna nets, but why aren't they outraged about the tuna being caught in tuna nets?""

* ""Walmart raised the price of a service from $1 to $10 so now i'm taking it for free"" 

* ""Walmart is unsafe because there was a credit card skimmer on a cash register. Therefore I can take items I want for free every week.""

* NFT never had real mainstream appeal and was always relegated to nerdy/techbro internet subculture",DrCornSyrup,502,374,0.9200000166893005,0.1506118230464506,1699449626,/r/changemyview/comments/17qlhq0/cmv_even_without_the_benefit_of_hindsight_nfts/,2023,11
17vzoxn,CMV: People who plan not to vote for Biden because of his handling of the Israel-Palestine conflict are damaging their own cause,"I understand that there are a lot of emotions about the current conflict, but the other day there was a pro-Palestine rally in my very liberal neighborhood and people were chanting “Fuck Joe Biden!” 

I was shocked and have since read that, among those who support Palestine, some are saying that Biden’s trip to Israel, his plan to send economic support for their army, and his speeches supporting them have cost him their vote in the 2024 presidential election.

Meanwhile, Trump is the one who recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, called for a ban of all Muslims immigrating to the United States and has recently suggested that we should ban anyone from Gaza from entering the United States. I read a quote from him stating that, if he were elected in 2024, “Israel would never have to be prepared” against future attacks, implying he would completely destroy Gaza to remove that threat. In short, Trump’s position is much more strongly pro-Israel and virulently anti-Palestine than Biden.

Additionally, although Biden has supported Israel, he has also reportedly urged caution about the scale of the invasion, voiced disagreement with Israel’s handling of the war, and insisted on humanitarian pauses and delivery of aid to the Gazan people. In short he seems to be a voice of reason and advocating for civilian safety.

Granted that some progressives in deep blue states abstaining from voting for Biden may not swing the election to Trump. However, if it does and Trump assumes power, I think many of the people who support Palestine will be sorry with their decision.",Advanced_Piano1062,398,505,0.7400000095367432,0.15038739322142036,1700071778,/r/changemyview/comments/17vzoxn/cmv_people_who_plan_not_to_vote_for_biden_because/,2023,11
186krbt,CMV: hell is a horrible concept morally,"This post goes for anybody who belongs to the abrahamic religions or any other religion that believes in hell 

Many people have made the argument I’m gonna make here against religion but I’m asking it because I’ve never heard a good refutation and it is one of the biggest points of argument for me that these religions are fictional

So hell is universally considered to be a place of eternal torture, involving burning for the unfortunate beings who end up there. This goes on for eternity. Can you imagine what somebody would have to do to you for you to want them to burn *for the rest of eternity*? Our minds can’t even comprehend a timeframe that long. It will never end. Imagine if we kept prisoners alive permanently somehow and kept them in a cell for the rest of the universes existence. And that’s only a cell, that’s not burning them the entire time it’s happening

And worse yet, this doesn’t just go for somebody who mercilessly rapes then murders an innocent child, this goes for me, and most of the people who have ever existed and exist today because we either reject God or worship the wrong one. Why should a Hindu who is born in India and spends their entire lives only knowing Hinduism be tortured for the rest of eternity? Why should an atheist scientist be tortured for the rest of eternity for simply learning about science and realizing that fundamentalist abrahamic religions don’t work well with it? 

This honestly seems like one of the most evil beliefs one can have to me, given that the religious person believes it literally and not metaphorically. I can see believing that people will go to a metaphorical hell for not adopting certain beliefs, though even that I disagree with cause it doesn’t apply to everyone

I’ll give Muslims a bit of leeway for this cause at least, according to what I’ve been told as I was converting to Islam, a persons exposure to the religion is taken into account and for some I guess there is another challenge after they die if they don’t make it to jannah. But even then, many ex Muslims go on to be perfectly decent people so this is still morally reprehensible

For Christians from what I know this is a hard set rule that if you reject Christ, you burn for eternity

Please if you have a good argument against this, try to change my view. I have an open mind",jxssss,371,495,0.800000011920929,0.1437898090067869,1701246708,/r/changemyview/comments/186krbt/cmv_hell_is_a_horrible_concept_morally/,2023,11
