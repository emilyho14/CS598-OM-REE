1j0yfzf,CMV: “America First” Somehow Keeps Putting Russia First,"
Trump sat across from Zelenskyy, an ally whose country is literally being invaded, and instead of backing him… he mocked him. Called him “disrespectful.” Accused him of “gambling with World War III.” Then he stormed out and killed a minerals deal that would’ve benefited the U.S. because, apparently, humiliating Ukraine was the bigger priority.

And who benefits? Russia. Again.

I hear the arguments… some of you think Zelenskyy is dragging this war out instead of negotiating. Or that he’s too reliant on U.S. aid and isn’t “grateful enough.” Maybe you think Ukraine is corrupt, that this is just another endless war, or that backing them will drag us into something worse.

But let’s be honest, what’s the alternative? Let Russia take what they want and hope they stop there? Hand them pieces of Ukraine and pretend it won’t encourage them to push further? That’s not peace, that’s appeasement. And history has shown exactly how well that works.

As for the money… yes, supporting Ukraine costs us. But what’s the price of letting authoritarian regimes redraw borders by force? What happens when China takes the hint and moves on Taiwan? Or when NATO allies realize America only stands with them when it’s convenient? Pulling support doesn’t end the war; it just ensures Ukraine loses.

And the corruption argument? Sure, Ukraine has problems. So do plenty of countries we support—including some we’ve gone to war for. But since when does corruption disqualify a country from defending itself? If that’s the standard, should we stop selling weapons to half the Middle East? Should we have abandoned France in World War II because of Vichy collaborators?

You don’t have to love Zelenskyy. You don’t even have to love Ukraine. But pretending that walking away is anything but a gift to Russia is either naïve or exactly the point.

But let’s be real. If someone invaded America and told us to hand over Texas or NY for “peace,” would you? Would Trump? Or would we fight like hell to keep what’s ours?

Trump doesn’t seem to grasp that. He talks like Ukraine should just fold, like it’s a bad poker hand he wouldn’t bother playing. He doesn’t see lives, homes, or an entire country fighting for survival… just a guy who didn’t flatter him enough before asking for help. 

Meanwhile, Putin doesn’t even have to lift a finger. Trump does the work for him, whether it’s insulting allies, weakening NATO, or making sure Russia gets what it wants without resistance.

So if “America First” keeps making life easier for Russia, what exactly are we first in?",MrBootsie,8938,1728,0.9200000166893005,0.9808013355592655,1740832296,/r/changemyview/comments/1j0yfzf/cmv_america_first_somehow_keeps_putting_russia/,2025,3
1j8qwwt,"CMV: If Democrats Gain Full Control, They Have Every Right to Prosecute Republicans and Their Allies Who Have Weaponized Government for Political Gain","The current American administration has demonstrated a relentless campaign against anything they consider progressive or left-leaning. Through their attacks on Democrats, the weaponization of the DOJ, and even the reported revocation of security clearances for law firms representing figures like Jack Smith, they have set a dangerous precedent.

For years, Republicans have accused Democrats of “weaponizing government,” yet under this administration, we’ve seen an actual systematic effort to punish political opponents, undermine legal accountability, and shield powerful conservative figures from scrutiny. If Democrats regain control of the presidency, Senate, and House, they not only have the right but the duty to bring to account those who have engaged in corruption, abuse of power, and the dismantling of democratic norms.

This should not be done out of pure political retaliation but as a necessary step to uphold the rule of law. If individuals like Trump, his enablers in Congress, and powerful conservative figures like Elon Musk have engaged in unlawful activities, they should face real legal consequences.

The idea that pursuing accountability is equivalent to authoritarianism is a false equivalence. If laws were broken, and democracy was attacked, ignoring those crimes in the name of “moving forward” only invites further abuses. Holding bad actors accountable is essential to preventing future erosion of democratic institutions.",Alacrityneeded,5527,1797,0.8700000047683716,0.8091855001118818,1741700202,/r/changemyview/comments/1j8qwwt/cmv_if_democrats_gain_full_control_they_have/,2025,3
1jg6hl8,CMV: Trump has literally become infallible and there is literally nothing can do that would cause him to lose support from his base and republicans,"At this point, there’s nothing Trump can do that would cause republicans and his base to stop supporting him. He has a cult of personality like Kim Jong Un, where the leader is always correct no matter what and everyone supports every decision he does. 

He was just sold innocent migrants into slavery in El Salvador. He is arbitrarily arresting green card for free speech. He is dismantling government departments without congressional approval. He is ignoring court orders. He is openly siding with Russia against Europe. He is tariffing and threatening to invade our allies. He is crashing the economy.

What could he do that would cause them to not support him? 

Here are some things that could happen but I can’t see anyone on the right caring about it:

If he arrested American citizens for free speech, they wouldn’t care. If he deported American citizens to El Salvador or gitmo without a trial, they wouldn’t care. If the economy collapsed 2008 style, they wouldn’t care. If he arrested judges who ruled against hum, they wouldn’t care. If he pulled out of NATO and allied with russia against europe, they wouldnt care. If he invaded canada, they woildnt care. If he declared martial law and used the military to arrest his political opponents, they wouldn’t care. If he canceled the 2026 and 2028 elections, they wouldnt care. 

Can someone convince me otherwise? That there actually is a red line Trump could cross that would lead republicans and his own supporters to stop supporting him? Because I don’t see it.

1j8ugsg,CMV: Anti Woke discourse is simply a euphemism for the eradication of civil rights.," It is not acceptable to say, “Black people are gaining too much social power and must be put back into their place.”

So they say, “Enough of this woke bullshit.”

It is no longer acceptable to say, “These LGBT+ individuals are ruining family values and must be eliminated.”

So they say, “The woke virus is infecting our children.”

It is less socially acceptable to say, “Women are destroying industry and must be forced into homemaking and child-rearing.”

So they say, “Woke feminism is destroying the women of America.”

Some argue that opposition to “wokeness” is simply about rejecting extremism. But in practice, anti-woke rhetoric overwhelmingly targets marginalized groups, civil rights progress, and efforts toward inclusion—not radical or fringe ideas. The radical/fringe ideas are used as justification for the elimination of rights across the board.

1jmkhau,CMV: Conservatives are fundamentally uninterested in facts/data.,"In fairness, I will admit that I am very far left, and likely have some level of bias, and I will admit the slight irony of basing this somewhat on my own personal anecdotes. However I do also believe this is supported by the trend of more highly educated people leaning more and more progressive.

However I always just assumed that conservatives simply didn't *know* the statistics, and that if they learned them they would change their opinion based on that new information. I have been proven wrong countless times however, both online, in person, while canvasing. It's not a matter of presenting data, neutral sources, meeting them in the middle. They either refuse to engage with things like studies and data completely, or they decide that because it doesn't agree with their intuition that it must be somehow ""fake"" or invalid. 

When I talk to these people and ask them to provide a source of their own, or what is informing their opinion, they either talk directly past it, or the conversation ends right there. I feel like if you're asked a follow up like ""Oh where did you get that number?"" and the conversation suddenly ends, it's just an admission that you're pulling it out of your ass, or you saw it online and have absolutely no clue where it came from or how legitimate it is. It's frustrating. 

I'm not saying there aren't progressives who have lost the plot and don't check their information, however I feel like it's championed among conservatives. Conservatives have pushed for decades at this point to destroy trust in any kind of academic institution, boiling them down to ""indoctrination centers."" They have to, because otherwise it looks glaring that the 5 highest educated states in the US are the most progressive and the 5 lowest are the most conservative, so their only option is to discredit academic integrity. 

I personally am wrong all the time, it's a natural part of life. If you can't remember the last time you were wrong, then you are simply ignorant to it.

1jj2z63,"CMV: Pete Hegseth is every bit as incompetent as people feared he would be, and should be investigated for violation of the Espionage Act. But he won't be.","As has been [recently](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/) [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/us/trump-news#hegseth-classified-war-plans-group-chat), Pete Hegseth recently texted the plans for an American strike in Yemen to a Signal group-chat that somehow included the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg. Doing his part for information security, Goldberg did not disclose that this had happened until after the strike had been carried out, and when he did, did not share the details of the plans.

Using a commercial messaging up to share sensitive information about American military operations is an enormous breach of information security, and, as many in the linked articles have opined, this kind of breach could have harmed the lives of American intelligence and military personnel.

Given the current state of the government, I imagine that Hegseth will walk away from this with little more than a slap on the wrist. But he should be investigated, and, if found in violation of the law, tried and sentenced for what is, at best, egregious carelessness toward those Americans whose lives depend on his leadership.

1j47t8d,CMV: The probability of Trump being a Russian agent is high enough to be taken very seriously,"First of all, there are multiple [accounts ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/29/trump-russia-asset-claims-former-kgb-spy-new-book)of people who had worked in Soviet intelligence during 80s stating that Trump was actively cultivated as an asset during that time. Trump [first visited](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842/) Russia in 1987, before it became significantly easier for westerners to enter it. At that time the people who were actually invited from West to USSR were diplomats, people important for business reasons (e.g. providing expertise for some factory USSR wanted to build), PR (leftist authors, children, etc.) or (potential) intelligence assets. The formal reason for Trump's visit - building a Trump tower next to Kremlin seems less than realistic, but it served as a passable cover story for intelligence use (at least when Trump attracted less attention). It should also be noted that at approximately same time, Australia [rejected ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/trumps-bid-for-sydney-casino-30-years-ago-rejected-due-to-mafia-connections)his bid to build a casino there due to his ""mafia connections"" - meaning Trump likely was already not law-abiding citizen back then.

  
So there is a lot of evidence that Russia tried to recruit Trump. Given that Russia [provided him a lot of money](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/) later on, after Trump ran his earlier business into ground, it seems likely that the recruitment was successful

  
Once recruited he would be on the hook permanently. While as US president Trump would have enough of his own leverage to not be forced to automatically do everything Russia asked, Russia could cause him enough problems that they would be able to ""request"" him to perform services every now and then. It can also be noted that once it was pretty much certain that Trump was leaving White House, his counterleverage on Russia would be gone, and he could be forced into extra services - like, say, providing Russia with confidential documents, and every service provided to Russia would make it harder to extricate himself (as such arrangements usually work).

  
Similarly, once Trump won the election again, Russia would be VERY insistent that Trump do something about US support for Ukraine (at least once Trump got his most immediate priorities in order). However even among republicans there would be quite a significant number that would have issues with simply announcing the end of support to Ukraine. So a show would be needed to sell this idea. You may note how during Zelensky's visit to White House Vance did multiple attacks on Zelensky that he would have never dared without prior Trump's approval (if your boss invites someone for supposedly important deal, you don't just start attacking them out of the blue). So Trump and Vance discussed this in advance and the plan was to try to provoke Zelensky. This seems rather strange is Trump's actual priority was really the minerals. However it makes sense if Trump would prefer to look like a person who cared about US economic interests, while getting pretext to end support for Ukraine for reasons which at first glance involved mainly other people. That said, in that case even if Zelensky jumped through all the hoops and the deal did not fall apart, that could be made to work to both Russia and Trump's benefit, just slower. Trump would tout getting control over some of Ukraine's resources, Ukrainian (and European) economic situation would weaken, while Trump could a few months later find a myriad reasons why Ukraine was doing something wrong and the support had to be reduced/withheld anyway (it's not like Trump's supporters would care about his lack of consistency).



Now, there's a lot of various facts pointing to Trump having been recruited by Russia decades ago, and Russia probably still having sufficient leverage over him. It does not however amount to a smoking gun. You could argue however that with the current circumstantial evidence it looks sufficiently probable to become a significant factor in analysis and prediction of Trump's actions, and for the people with a stake in US politics to care about. To make an analogy, consider a person whose 3 previous spouses died under suspicious circumstances with that person inheriting money from each. It does not quite amount to proof of guilt, but it could be a sufficient reason for law enforcement to investigate this deeper, and if you or someone close to you was planning to become that person's 4th spouse, it would be quite reasonable to seriously take that past pattern into account, take significant precautions, and be alert for further pieces that would support that.

  
On the subject of investigations - the obvious question would be that Trump would be investigated under Biden for such links. The problem is that if Trump were to be accused, he'd immediately declare it a witch hunt, and when Trump had support of half the country, anything short of a smoking gun proof would be ignored by his supporters, and an attempt to arrest Trump could trigger a civil war. And even for a serious investigation it may be difficult to come up with smoking gun - even if e.g. decrypted text logs of Trump's communication with his handlers were produced, Trump would just declare them to be fake, and his supporters would not give it a second thought - which could have easily strengthened Trump's position at election by giving him a martyr card if the accusation was pressed - so it's quite probable that in such scenario Biden would choose to not rock the boat and hope that Trump would just not be able to win again.",Ancquar,7146,803,0.9100000262260437,0.6231817953718892,1741194021,/r/changemyview/comments/1j47t8d/cmv_the_probability_of_trump_being_a_russian/,2025,3
1j49p5o,CMV: MAGA Is A True Fascist Movement,"I'm using R. Griffin's definition palingenetic ultra-nationalism, or true fascism, to identify MAGA.

The two components of this ideology is the palingenetic *myth* and populist *ultra-nationalism.*

Definitions:

Palingenetic myth: “a generic term for the vision of a radically *new* beginning which follows a period of destruction or perceived dissolution.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 33)

“At the heart of the palingenetic political myth lies the belief that contemporaries are living through or about to live through a 'sea-change', a 'water-shed' or 'turning-point' in the historical process. The perceived corruption, anarchy, oppressiveness, iniquities or decadence of the present, rather than being seen as immutable and thus to be endured indefinitely with stoic courage or bleak pessimism, are perceived as having reached their peak and interpreted as the sure sign that one era is nearing its end and a new order is about to emerge.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 35)

Populist: “a generic term for political forces which, even if led by a small elite cadres or self-appointed 'vanguard', in practice or in principle (and not merely for show) depend on 'people power' as the basis for legitimacy.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 36-37)

Ultra-nationalism: “forms of nationalism which 'go beyond', and hence reject, anything compatible with liberal institutions or with the tradition of Enlightenment humanism which underpins it.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 37)

“Populist ultra-nationalism rejects the principles both of absolutism and of pluralist representative government. ... it thus repudiates both 'traditional' and 'legal/rational' forms of politics in favour of prevalently 'charismatic' ones in which the cohesion and dynamics of movements depends almost exclusively on the capacity of their leaders to inspire loyalty and action.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 37)

Palingenetic ultra-nationalism: “a genus of political energy... whose mobilizing vision is that of *the national community rising phoenix-like after a period of encroaching decadence which all but destroyed it*.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 38)

In short, this is the *fascist minimum*, palingenetic ultra-nationalism, MAGA.

Applying the definitions to Trump and MAGA:

The Make America Great Again slogan conjures the palingenetic myth. His rhetoric of empty promises of America's new Golden Age (only for the billionaires), and constant blaming of the 'deep state', immigrants, cultural Marxists, liberals, 'unhumans' and so on and so forth hindering their march into a fairy-tale future. These groups are identified as the *existing order* that caused America to become corrupt and decadent, that the system needs overthrown so a new utopian Golden Age can begin.

“Yet the predominance of the utopian component... also has two important practical consequences which several *limit* its effectiveness as a political force. First, the core myth of palingenetic ultra-nationalism is susceptible to so many nuances of interpretation in terms of specific 'surface' ideas and policies that... it tends to generate a wide range of competing currents and factions even within the same political culture...” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 39)

Currently, there are three main factions within the MAGA party.

1. The Dark Enlightenment oligarchs, whose palingenetic myth entails the ascendance of a *patchwork* of techno-monarchy city-states out of the destruction of civilization they create. One of the founders of the Dark Enlightenment philosophy, Curtis Yarvin, is also the architect of the butterfly revolution and designed the blueprints for DOGE's RAGE.

1. The Christian Nationalists, with their dream of cleansing the nation of all the sinful and decadent liberals, merging church and state to form a Christian nation or 'heaven on Earth' out of the rubble. This is the goal of Project 2025.
2. The MAGA Ultra-nationalists, whose visions have never been truly articulated other than 'bringing back' some Golden Age I can only assume some version of a nostalgic fairy-tale society that was only ever depicted in 1950s advertisements.

It is important to note that all these factions share some version of the palingenetic myth. They are all working together to achieve the destruction of the current order, the toppling of America's constitutional republic. They differ on what comes after the destruction, and have no real idea what it will be, like the dog who finally catches up to the car.

There can never been a light at the end of the tunnel for Trump and MAGA, the Golden Age will eternally be just beyond the horizon. They will have to endlessly create new 'enemies from within' and without preventing them from achieving their promised utopia. It will not end with rounding up all the immigrants or conquering Greenland and Canada, there will always be new enemies in their eternal struggle for 'MAGA'.

“Second, it means that fascism is in its element as an oppositional ideology only as long as the climate of national crisis prevails... it can only maintain its momentum and cohesion by continually precipitating events which seemed to fulfil the promise of permanent revolution, of continuing palingenesis.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 40)

“In a grotesque travesty of Faustian restlessness, fascism cannot permit itself to linger on a bed of contentment: its arch-enemy is the 'normality' of human society in equilibrium, its Achilles heel as a form of practical politics the utopianism which the fear of this enemy breeds.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 40)

“Without precise objectives the fascist must move forward all the time, but just because precise objectives are lacking he can never stop, and every goal attained is a stage on the continuous treadmill of the future he claims to construct, of the national destiny he claims to fulfil. Fascist dynamism comes at the price of this, and therein lies its profound revolutionary nature, but also it seems the seeds of its eventual fall.” (E. Weber, 1964, p 78)

I think everyone, even the most mindless of Trump's followers, can agree that Trump is a populist. He has mastered the art of demagoguery, every lie that spews out of his mouth resonates with his base.

“Admittedly, the concept of the organic national community connotes classlessness, unfettered social mobility and an abolition of the inequities of *laissez-faire* capitalism in a way which allowed some of its ideologues to claim to represent 'true' democracy. Yet power in the new community would remain descending rather than ascending even after the rebirth (in any case an ongoing process) had been inaugurated in a new order, for it would be concentrated in the hands of those who had risen 'naturally' through the ranks of the various hierarchical organizations in which all the political, economic and cultural energies of the nation were to be channelled and orchestrated. In a mystic version of direct democracy, the representation of the people's general will in a fascist society would mean entrusting authority to an elite or (especially in its inter-war versions) a leader whose mission it is to safeguard the supra-individual interests and destiny of the people to whom it (or he) claims to be linked by a metaphysical bond of a common nationhood. A paradox thus lies at the heart of fascist ultra-nationalism. It is populist in intent and rhetoric, yet elitist in practice.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 41)

This elitist form of populism, this top-down hierarchical structure, means the *charismatic leader* decides what the 'will of the people' is, which then flows down to 'the people'. The movements gains its power through the leader. Was MAGA calling for the invasion of Greenland, or was Trump (at the request of the Dark Enlightenment oligarch Dryden Brown)? How about tariffs to impoverish everyday Americans, is that the 'will of the people'?

“The most obvious symptom of the reliance of both on charismatic power is, of course, the leader cult, which in both regimes \[a reference to Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy\] became increasingly important to paper over the widening cracks between propaganda and reality. ...However, the very success of an individual in becoming the charismatic leader of a fascist movement, and even mounting an assault on state power, is also its Achille's heel. In the long run the law of entropy which applies to the innovatory or expansionist momentum of a regime will also affect the leader himself. It will do so inexorably and in a way which the most efficient propaganda machine in the world cannot conceal indefinitely: he will grow infirm and eventually die.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 42)

MAGA contain all essential ingredients of palingenetic ultra-nationalism (true fascism).

As long as this idea is out in the public ethos, former president Obama should have his hat in the ring for three major reasons:



1) It compels the traditional checks on power (the Supreme Court) to issue a ruling on this matter. If they rule that Trump \*can\* seek a third term while Obama cannot, that decision would be ""settled"" rather than hypothetical.

  
2) Obama's presidency left much to be desired, but he is by far the most electorally successful candidate the democrats have run since 2000. Even with a healthy dose of voter suppression, I'd like his chances against Donny.

  
3) I'm not calling for the end of rules and decorum, but abusing the ""norms"" has become a popular, even politically successful strategy. We must focus on moving the country in a positive direction; getting Obama out on the campaign trail could represent that desire, and would also be a significant departure from the norms observed by the democratic parts (which is why this is very unlikely to actually happen).",iAINTaTAXI,5827,749,0.8799999952316284,0.5343706717381459,1743443784,/r/changemyview/comments/1jo9hw8/cmv_obama_needs_to_hit_the_campaign_trail_until/,2025,3

The student had a valid student visa but it was revoked on Tuesday. The department of homeland security claimed that the student supported Hamas and for that reason her visa was revoked. No details or evidence was provided to support that claim.

The student has not been charged with any crime. The only two actions news outlets have identified that the student took related to the Hamas-Israel war were to publish an article and help organize a potluck to support Palestinian students. The article was published in the student newspaper and argued that Tufts University should follow the recommendations of the student union resolution to boycott Sabra, divesting from Israeli companies, and condemn the genocide of Palestinians.

I think it’s wrong that a student would have their visa revoked and then be detained in a prison in Louisiana without any evidence of wrongdoing being presented.

1jeq5bb,CMV: Arabs are a lost cause,"As an Arab myself, I would really love for someone to tell me I am wrong and that the Arab world has bright future ahead of it because I lost hope in Arabs nearly a decade ago and the recent events in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Iraq have crashed every bit of hope i had left. 


The Arab world is the laughing stock of the world, nobody take us seriously or want Arab immigrants in their countries, why should they? Out of 22 Arab countries, 10 are failed states, 5 are stable but poor and has authoritarian regimes, 6 are rich, but with theocratic monarchies where slavery is still practiced. The only democracy with decent human rights in the Arab world is Tunisia who's poor and last year they have elected a dictator wannabe. 


And the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq are just embarrassing, Arabs are killing eachother over something that happened 1400 years ago (battle of Karabala) while we are seeing the west trying to get colonize mars. 


I don't think Arabs are capable to make a developed democratic state that doesn't violate human rights, its either secular dictatorship or Islamic dictatorship. When the Arabs have a democracy they always vote for an Islamic dictatorship instead like what happened in Palestine, Iraq, Egypt and Tunisia.

Lefty atheists are the absolute worst on this, they’ll attack Christianity all day but never discuss Islam whatsoever.

Vast majority of conservatives either don’t believe in climate change or don’t buy electric vehicles which means now the vast majority of people who own teslas are either liberals or centrists. (The cybertruck doesn’t really count for this peculiar point though) 

Now when a normal democrat voter or a centrist who leans democrat sees that their car that they got to prevent climate change got burned down. They can wind up being radicalized into thinking that the democrats are completely insane and can’t be trusted. Most people don’t actively care about politics until it affects them and having your car burnt down will make it affect you. This can lead into even more radical thinking like someone supporting turning burning teslas into domestic terrorism because “my car got burnt down they cost me a lot of money fuck them” ways of thinking. 

As far as violent conservative backlash goes I don’t think I need to go to deep into this one and the likely hood it will happen.

1jmlvp4,CMV: it is disrespectful and disingenuous to not make the distinction between legal and illegal immigrants.,"I’m a Chinese Canadian that immigrated legally with my family, so my view is definitely influenced by this experience.

When I look at online and real life discussions of Trump’s deportation plans and border issues and similar, more often than not, people participating in the discussion omit the word “illegal” when in fact, they are talking about illegal immigration. 

This feels highly disingenuous, as the purposeful removal of the word “illegal” seems to be whitewashing, or muddying the illegality, of border crossing or overstaying. I think it is intentionally misleading when people say “migrants” or “immigrants”, when in reality they are referring to undocumented migrants.

It is also very much disrespectful to those to worked hard, studied English, passed exams, took a risk for their children, all while respecting the law, to lump them together with illegal immigrants. Asking questions like “why do you hate immigrants?” is disingenuous, useless, and straight up disrespectful. This type of ambiguity hinders a genuine discussion, because the people who refuse to make the distinction are intentionally watering down the obvious illegality of illegal immigration.

The only exception that I can understand is if your moral/political beliefs involve the right of migration and dismantling of international borders, which by definition eliminates the need to make the distinction of the legality of the migrants.

My argument is that, if you want a discussion that is genuine and respectful, you must specify the type of immigration in question.",IncidentHead8129,1115,710,0.8100000023841858,0.25992560759566335,1743253616,/r/changemyview/comments/1jmlvp4/cmv_it_is_disrespectful_and_disingenuous_to_not/,2025,3

- Islam request Arabic
Islam forces its followers to pray and read Quran in Arabic compare to Christianity where you read the Bible and pray in your native language, Arabic is also the language of heavens in Islam, you need to say the shahada in Arabic to covert to Islam and even adhan (call for pray) is also required to be Arabic. Non-Arab Muslims uses Arabic terms like Inshallah, subhanallah, astaghfirallah and etc. 


-You need to be a descendants of Qurayshi Arabs to be a Caliphate

Many sunni hadiths have emphasized the Caliphate need to be descendants of Qurayshi (Muhammed's tribe for those who don't know) which's why a lot of Muslims don't consider non-Arab caliphates like ottomans to be a legit caliphate and anti-ottoman Arabs have used the fact they aren't Quaryashi to delegitmize them as true Caliphate, and there's many non-Arab Muslim rulers like Saladdin who fit all requirements of being a Caliphate except the fact that he was a Kurdish instead of being a Qurayshi Arab. 


- Islam is heavily Arab centric 

You required to do pilgrimage to two cities in Arabia as a Muslim, you idolize Arab figures like Omar, Abu bakr, Othman and Ali and Islam tells you to be live and act like prophet Muhammed (an Arab man), you follow an Arabic calender system, you required pray towards Mecca, non-Arab Muslims wear Arabic clothes like hijab, abya and thawb and non-Arab Muslims give their children Arabic names while non-Arabic names are looked down on.

1j9342a,CMV: MAGA loves ‘Free Speech’ until the speaker Is brown.,"
Mahmoud Khalil was arrested in the middle of the night. No charges. No trial. No warrant. ICE agents dragged a lawful permanent resident out of his home in front of his pregnant wife and locked him in a Louisiana detention center, 1,300 miles away. He is a husband, a researcher, a recent graduate with a master’s degree… But he is also Palestinian. And he protested. He’s not a criminal. He’s not a terrorist. He legally  protested… 

No one voted for this. No one passed a law saying ICE can disappear people for having the wrong opinions. No one decided protesting was a crime. But somehow, Trump did. He went online after the arrest, called Khalil a “Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student,” and made sure everyone knew: “The first arrest of many to come.”

That should piss off anyone who believes in freedom.

The government now has the power to grab any legal resident and call them a national security threat… without proof, without a trial, without due process. If you think that power stays aimed at people you don’t like, you haven’t been paying attention.

A Chinese PhD student at UC Berkeley was arrested last week for attending a pro-Palestinian protest. No criminal act, no violence, just speech. Trump is already talking about stripping citizenship from people he deems “un-American.” He’s promising mass deportations, mass arrests, mass punishment for people who speak out against him.

What exactly does “the first of many” mean? Who else is on that list?

It’s funny how the same people who screamed about weaponized government, who swore the deep state was coming for them, who chanted “Free Speech!” every time someone got banned from Twitter, are now completely fine with ICE detaining people over their political views. The ones who said the Second Amendment exists to resist tyranny now shrug when the First is trampled.

Maybe it’s different when it’s someone else’s rights being erased. Maybe the Constitution only matters when it’s your speech on the line. But that’s not how freedom works. If the government can disappear one legal resident without charges, they can do it to anyone.

If that doesn’t bother you, just say you never cared about liberty in the first place.

Partisan infighting, government gridlock, and internal strife make it harder for any president—especially Trump—to wield power effectively. The US’s global influence has also been waning as China expands its reach through its growing Belt and Road Empire.

The most significant factor is the difference in governance. The US president operates within a democratic system that imposes limits on power—courts, Congress, elections, media scrutiny, and public opinion all act as constraints. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping is an authoritarian leader who has effectively consolidated power, removed term limits, cracked down on dissent, and expanded surveillance and social control. In other words, he can dictate policies with little resistance, while a US president is constantly facing checks and opposition (despite what Trump and DOGE are trying).

China is making strategic moves to replace the US as the dominant global force. It is investing in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, gaining influence in regions the US has neglected. It is also developing economic alliances that reduce reliance on the dollar and expanding military capabilities, particularly in the South China Sea.

Putin might have been sabotaging America, but China is the real winner of America's repeated own goals. The USA still has massive soft power, but who knows how much longer that will last considering divisions and the current administration. The world order is shifting, and it’s time to acknowledge that the most powerful person on Earth might no longer be sitting in the White House.

I don't even like China, and have 0 plans to visit it, but facts are facts. Unless you can show me otherwise. CMV.

1j7926t,CMV: MAGA only cares about veterans when it’s campaign season,"The same maga peeps who chant “support the troops” at rallies don’t seem to care much once those troops come home. 80,000 VA jobs are on the chopping block, and somehow the “most pro-military president ever” thinks gutting healthcare and services is a good way to honor veterans.

Veteran homelessness? Still a crisis. Veteran suicides? Still happening at ~17 per day. The VA budget? Shrinking… unless you count the part that gets funneled to private contractors. Meanwhile, defense spending stays sky-high because supporting the military only counts when there’s a war to fight.

Trump called fallen soldiers suckers and losers, but the people who claim to love veterans just shrugged. Which really confuses me but…When military leadership wouldn’t bend the knee, he purged them. When John McCain, a POW, criticized him, he mocked his capture. This isn’t new. The GOP loves to perform patriotism, until veterans need something that doesn’t fit on a bumper sticker.

When the cameras are rolling, they wrap themselves in the flag. When the cameras are off, they cut benefits work to privatize care, and let veterans and veteran workers fired, fend for themselves.

1jmz7ac,CMV: damaging Tesla cars that are owned by individuals to protest the company makes no sense,"Tesla, and Elon Musk in particular, have been very prominent ever since he became a major part of the US government. I was especially affected by this shift, as someone who combines multiple nationalities and ideologies that Musk openly despises - so to set things straight, I'm very supportive of protests against Musk and his companies. I'm also not here to argue about the effectiveness of violence or property damage as a means of protesting - for the sake of argument, just assume that it can be very effective. I'm talking about specifically damaging individual, random Tesla cars, because the attitude towards doing that has become kind of psychotic recently. Not just on the hardcore dedicated subreddits (Cyberstuck and whatnot), but city subreddits or default subs - nearly everyone seems to agree over this nowadays. There's little to no nuance when people discuss this.

My point here is that damaging Teslas that have already been purchased hurts a random person and does absolutely nothing to the Tesla company. The company has already received its money for the car, and they really don't care if you use it or drive it off a cliff straight off the lot. In fact, partially damaging them actually benefits Tesla, because Tesla makes good money by selling replacement parts and repair services. I'll address a few very common responses that I've seen floating around.

**Random people are an acceptable loss because this protesting makes people scared of buying Teslas**: I disagree with both parts. For one, I don't think that this is an acceptable loss - for many people (and young people especially), a car is often the most expensive asset one owns. Despite the way people characterize it, Teslas aren't only owned by the ultra-rich - both because many US residents are happy to take on boatloads of debt for a nicer car, and because used Teslas aren't actually that expensive. For these groups, destroying or damaging their car is life-ruining. For two, I don't think that the effectiveness of ""making people scared"" is justified. Anyone who wants to buy a Tesla *now*, while all this is happening, has already taken on an ideological position and is okay with that risk. A person who already likes Elon Musk won't be bothered by this.

**Tesla owners are mostly Elon lovers and/or far-rightists and they deserve it**: the way how people handled the Elon sentiment shift from Reddit's favorite billionaire to what he is now has been really jarring, because so many people are now claiming they 'always knew', and so did everybody else. I don't think there's this many fortune tellers among us - Musk has pivoted very strongly after COVID. He has had his asshole moments and incidents before, but there really was nothing that'd set him far apart from your average billionaire or car company owner. No, he really has gone off the deep end. Whatever he was doing in the past is comparable to now, and even if someone personally disliked him in the 2010s, many still ended up buying Teslas because they're electric and because they didn't have good competition in the EV sector for a pretty long time. You can maybe place some of that ideological fault on anyone who bought a (new) car in the last few years, but not even Cybertruck owners fully fall into that group - since that car has been delayed many times, it means that its first owners were pre-ordering them in 2019. So no, most people didn't always know, nor do most of them support what has become of Elon's companies today.

**They should just sell their car**: this is the worst non-answer of them all, because it's only talking about solving someone's personal issue, not forming a coherent argument for why they should do it. So, say someone sells their Tesla because they're afraid of vandalism. Now, does the new owner of this used car deserve all the 'punishment'? How can you ideologically profile someone based on car ownership? How would you know if someone's car is brand new or used? Also, why should these current owners be liable to take a huge financial hit that comes from selling a used car, buying/fixing/insuring a replacement car, spending days doing all of that? It makes no sense.

I think this should cover most of it. I think that vandalizing/damaging/destroying cars that have already been bought is pretty horrible, *and* also ineffective as a form of protest. I also think that this is a huge distraction that refocuses ideological Americans towards infighting rather than effective protesting. The lack of a centralized protest movement in the US is pretty obvious, and much fewer people are willing to do the same vandalism to Tesla plants or dealerships, because they have the money and power to bring about consequences and retribution. The random, relatively powerless stranger whose Tesla's tires got slashed can't do that, so that's what people are focusing on.",noljo,430,721,0.6700000166893005,0.22466672967414303,1743290772,/r/changemyview/comments/1jmz7ac/cmv_damaging_tesla_cars_that_are_owned_by/,2025,3

1jj100l,CMV: Elon Musk IS Elizabeth Holmes. He just hasn't crashed out yet.,"Elon and Elizabeth suffer from symptoms of the same psychology. The internal dialog goes something like: ""I've become a billionaire; therefore, I must possess an unquantifiable genius that the rest of the population lacks. My bank account proves it."" They become drunk on the myth of their own genius. 

They never stop to ask themselves tough and reflective questions like, ""Was I just lucky?"" or ""Am I the beneficiary of a perfectly-timed investment and shifting industry?"" 

Elon is a classic case of a rich kid who had access to capital just as the US tech industry was exploding. He made some great investments, sure. But for every guy like Elon who made it, there are hundreds of others who may be smarter but simply weren't as lucky. They've now lost everything, where Elon has survived. Statistically, there will always be some lucky survivors; they aren't geniuses. 

Now that Elon's personal brand is imploding, he is again looking to external causes rather than asking himself the tough and reflective question: ""Did my behavior cause this?"" 

For both Elon and Elizabeth they've vastly overplayed their hands with this 'heads I win, tails you lose' thinking. In business school, I recall this being called an ""attribution error."" Executives tend to credit their quick thinking when the company succeeds but blame the 'economy' when it fails. ""It can never be me.""

So, Elon's crash is coming. It will be bigger than Elizabeth Holmes.' The video clip of him gleefully wielding a chainsaw as he simulates cutting family-supporting federal jobs will one day be the cover art on the tell-all documentary.

1jiv455,CMV: The Gaza war persists due to Hamas' refusal to surrender which is rooted in their religious ideology,"The ongoing Israel-Gaza war persists because Hamas refuses to surrender, despite having no realistic chance of military victory. Israel's overwhelming military advantage has inflicted heavy losses on Hamas fighters and infrastructure and it is only getting worse. And rather than capitulating when faced with destruction, as is typically the case in military conflict, Hamas continues to fight, prolonging the war and exacerbating suffering for civilians in Gaza.

What many in the West seem to forget - or are perhaps unaware of - is that Hamas is operating with an extremist religious ideology that views martyrdom as preferable to humiliation in defeat. 

It's why Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida said ""You love life the way we love death."" 

It's why top Hamas leader Khaled Mashal said that 2 million dead Palestinians is worth it for the liberation of the entire land. Sadly, people seem to lack even a basic understanding of Hamas' worldview and how little they care for the lives of their own people.

Hamas' radical interpretation of Islam glorifies dying in battle as an act of faith and resistance. This belief system abhors surrender as the ultimate defeat, betrayal, and humiliation, even if a diplomatic solution would protect Palestinian lives and put an end to the bloodshed. Because of this, Hamas isn't operating by the same logic we saw with the Germans and Japanese in WW2 where military defeat leads to surrender and peace. Hamas' ideology, and its commitment to endless resistance explains why they prioritize symbolic acts of defiance over pragmatic goals.

People understandably want an end to war, and yet calls for Hamas to surrender are nowhere to be found. The idea that Hamas can remain in power is untenable to anyone actually familiar with Hamas' long history of brutality and what the group stands for.

In light of all of the above, it's no surprise that Hamas refuses to surrender, and why all of their stipulations to hand back the hostages come with bizarre conditions that would allow them to claim at least an illusion of victory, even in the face of devastating losses. Their entire belief system emphasizes struggle over compromise and an admission of loss, which only reinforces the idea that surrender is not an option, regardless of the cost to Gaza’s population.

Unlike conflicts where one side concedes after suffering overwhelming losses, Hamas sees perpetual struggle as an inherent duty. The end result is that you have Israel trying to get its hostages back and Hamas willing to sacrafice every Palestinian rather than surrender. It's a death cult mentality that is apparent to anyone willing to look at Hamas with objective eyes.",thatshirtman,0,778,0.49000000953674316,0.216471897607123,1742834300,/r/changemyview/comments/1jiv455/cmv_the_gaza_war_persists_due_to_hamas_refusal_to/,2025,3
1j2ip0y,CMV: Germany’s Mainstream Parties Need to Take a Harder Stance on Immigration or Risk Losing to the Far Right,"The AfD’s surge in popularity isn’t some random political phenomenon, it’s the direct result of mainstream parties failing to address immigration concerns in a way that resonates with the public. Whether you love or hate the AfD, you can’t deny that they’ve capitalized on an issue that clearly matters to a large portion of Germans. The rise in terror attacks, violent crimes, and societal tensions linked (rightly or wrongly) to immigration has created a climate of fear and frustration. The scale of the issue is debatable, but at this point, news of another car plowing through a crowd or a knife attack in a train station barely raises an eyebrow, it’s become disturbingly routine.

This is where Germany’s mainstream parties have failed. By refusing to take a strong, clear stance on immigration, they’ve essentially handed the AfD a political goldmine. Some AfD voters are undoubtedly far right or racist, but many are supporting the party because it’s the only one willing to bluntly say, “We have a problem.” The rest tiptoe around the issue with vague promises, fear of being labeled xenophobic, or an insistence that it’s not *really* a problem. But when the public sees real world consequences (whether it’s crime, economic strain, or cultural clashes) no amount of hand waving will convince them otherwise.

We’ve already seen what happens when far right parties gain real power. Historically, it never ends well. But ignoring the issue won’t make it go away. If the mainstream political spectrum continues to downplay immigration concerns, the AfD will only grow stronger. Most of them don’t vote for the far right because they’re eager for extremism, they vote for it when they feel like there’s no other option. If Germany’s major parties want to stop the AfD’s momentum, they need to stop treating immigration as a taboo topic and start addressing it with the same directness and urgency. Otherwise, they’re just ceding ground to the very movement they claim to oppose.",Empty_Alternative859,419,689,0.7099999785423279,0.21514765104766118,1741008642,/r/changemyview/comments/1j2ip0y/cmv_germanys_mainstream_parties_need_to_take_a/,2025,3

This had two effects. 

First of all the Trump admin threw away most of the leverage it had over Ukraine. Like what more can they do to harm their position? Give weapons to Russia? That is very unlikely to happen. Ukrainians have little reason to care about Trump's opinion at this point. 

Second of all, Putin has now little reason to stop. While the lack of US aid will not be felt immediately, it will worsen the Ukrainian position in the long term. Why would Putin stop, when he is gaining territory? Especially considering that the Russian war economy runs very hot and is likely to take a massive, massive hit if all the weapons production was to stop. He can now realistically hope that a few more years can give him cities like Kharkiv, which he almost held and then lost.

1jixfpg,CMV: Women’s social expectations can harm young men too,"I’ve seen a lot of discussion about how men can be entitled in dating, friendships, and emotional expression. But I rarely see conversations about how certain behaviors and expectations from women can also be harmful to young men.

For example, men are constantly told that it’s their job to initiate relationships, approach, plan, lead. But when they struggle with this and express frustration, they’re often dismissed as ""entitled"" or told to just ""try harder."" Meanwhile, many women still expect to be courted without taking on any of that effort themselves. Isn’t that also a form of entitlement?

There’s also the assumption that men only pursue relationships for sex. Personally, I (and a lot of other guys) crave emotional connection, someone to actually listen, care, and make us feel safe. Yes, sex is a factor, but acting like it’s all men want is just as reductive as saying all women are only after money. At its worst, this mindset leads to manipulation, where sex is used as a tool for control or where men’s emotional needs are completely ignored.

Another thing I’ve noticed is how socially awkward or quiet guys are sometimes treated. Some conventionally attractive women will go out of their way to talk to ""awkward"" guys, but it doesn’t always feel like genuine interest. It can feel performative, like a self-esteem boost or a way to look good in front of others. And if a quiet guy just keeps to himself, he risks being labeled a ""creep"" or even an ""incel"" for simply existing in the wrong space. This makes it even harder for shy or socially anxious guys to feel comfortable around women.

Then there’s the way women can bully men, which doesn’t get talked about much. Fake asking someone out as a joke, spreading damaging rumors, or socially isolating them, these things happen, and they can really mess with a guy’s confidence. I’ve personally overheard women talking behind their friends' backs way more often than I ever have in male friend groups, yet social aggression is usually framed as a ""male"" problem.

And what about the expectation that men should have the same level of emotional intelligence as women? Many guys struggle with recognizing or expressing emotions, not because they don’t care, but because they weren’t taught how. Some only develop these skills in therapy, which costs time and money. But if a guy struggles emotionally, he’s often told to ""just communicate better"" while being judged for not already having the ability to navigate feelings like a seasoned pro. If emotional intelligence is something that has to be learned, does that mean men are expected to pay a financial cost just to be considered relationship material?

When you put all of this together, it’s not surprising that so many young men feel lost. They’re struggling in school, falling behind in college enrollment, and still expected to be financially successful while receiving less and less support. Meanwhile, many women still prefer partners who are high-earning and emotionally mature but don’t always acknowledge the barriers that men face in getting there.

I’m not saying all women behave this way, and I’m not excusing harmful male behavior either. I just think some of these issues go ignored, and they contribute to why so many young men feel disconnected and frustrated.",Short-Ad-4717,319,653,0.7200000286102295,0.19953686391866904,1742839759,/r/changemyview/comments/1jixfpg/cmv_womens_social_expectations_can_harm_young_men/,2025,3
1jd0qnd,CMV: American Conservatives are hypocrites when it comes to Israel,"The vision of plaeo, or neo neoconservatism (purely secular here) that is being propagated by current US conservatives has espoused less foreign entanglement, less immigration or cultural exchange, less global involvement or a pay to play model (no commitments but either getting paid for services or outright submission) even to strong traditional allies and trade partners, from Canada to the EU to Japan and Korea to the great pulling of the rug in Ukraine, until you meet Israel.

Then that conservative view goes head over heels in Israeli appeasement... from endless support to taking Gaza off Israel's hands so the US can take the blame for it, to going back to the Middle East (foregoing South China Sea and Eastern Europe) to bomb more Yemenis in the mountains. 

The thing is it's predictable, and easy to plan around.. I don't think Hamas pulling off Oct 7 at that time was an accident.. their leaders had contact with Moscow, it was to take the heat off Russia and destroy any moral high ground the West had. 

It's an easy reliable bet on the US support to Israel being blind, unconditional and devotional, even if it's against US interests, destroys soft power and moral standing and makes most of the Muslim world ~22% of the planet, most of the global south as potential enemies. 

That's it, if you're a conservative in the mold of how Washington envisioned no foreign entanglement, explain how it's consistent with your views.

Of course they will try to manipulate and remove voting rights from as many of the ""wrong people"" as they can.

They do not care about laws. Every branch of government has already been complicit in the whole sale violation of law at every level. There is some resistance but it's barely slowing them down.

1jjsvgx,CMV: I don't believe the Signal leak was an accident.,"When this story first came out, I bought the narrative that it was a blunder, but the more I read about it that theory doesn't make sense to me anymore.

The problem is not that I don't think they're incompetent enough to do it, but rather who it was that was added and when.  Michael Waltz added Jeffrey Goldberg as a connection two days before adding him to this small group, it was their first communication.  That first connection invite had to be established before he could be added to the group.  

If someone was going to leak a national security story, Jeffrey Goldberg is on a very short list of national security reporters with the experience, credibility, and platform who could be trusted to get this story out without compromising the operation or American intelligence methods.

So in order to believe this was a mistake we have to accept that someone made a new connection with this very specific person two days before the working group began and then accidentally added them to a conversation that pertains to their beat as a journalist.  

I can see accidentally adding someone to a chat, but it seems too great a coincidence that it was this particular person added just two days after a connection was first made.  

So if not a mistake, then what.

1. It's an intentional leak by the Trump team, possibly to put pressure on Europe, score some political point, or accomplish some interpersonal court politics type hit on someone you don't like.  This is possible, but it seems unlikely they would put themselves through this level of embarrassment and blowback when the same ends could've been accomplished in other ways.

2.  It's a whistleblower.  Possibly not even about the strike on the Houthis, but someone concerned that these conversations are happening on Signal at all.  Besides the obvious security concerns, what may be more consequential is that these conversations aren't be recorded and thus can't be FOIA'd.  If high-level discussions are consistently occurring over Signal it may be a strategy to get around the Presidential Records Act and shield themselves from legal scrutiny.

Then there’s Sodom and Gomorrah where God burns an entire city alive, including innocents (such as children and presumably victims living within the city walls) to punish city wide “sin”. The story does not suggest any attempt to differentiate between the guilty and innocent, nor does it show God offering alternatives beyond torturous mass destruction.

What’s worse, during the plagues of Egypt, God murders the firstborn sons of Egypt, after  “hardening the heart” of the Pharaoh multiple times, deliberately preventing him from letting the Israelites go - escalating the situation to inevitable violence.

These are stories we tell to children to describe the “love” of God. 

If a human leader behaved this way - ordering genocides, killing children, and punishing entire populations for the actions of a few (while calling it “love”), we would brand them a war criminal. 

To be clear, I’m not saying the Christian God couldn’t exist - I’m saying that if the God described in much of the Bible does exist as depicted, he is clearly one of the most evil beings in the universe.

So, change my view: How can a being responsible for such acts be called morally good? I’d especially like to hear perspectives that reconcile these stories with the idea of a benevolent deity.",Karma_Circus,267,588,0.6700000166893005,0.1785422373606193,1742235676,/r/changemyview/comments/1jdjpc8/cmv_if_the_christian_god_exists_he_is_clearly_evil/,2025,3
1j5i2cq,CMV: The whole egg-based rhetoric against Trump is dumb and should be scrapped for better angles,"Yes, he did promise to lower egg prices. Yes, egg prices are as high as ever. Is that really a good long-term strategy though? I come from an authoritarian country and this ""day-to-day"" low-res type of logic is a trap that dictators use to delegitimize their opposition.

If your main argument is built around ""egg prices high = trump bad"" then what happens when he subsidizes the price? Or when he blames the ""opportunistic"" store-owners for robbing the working class? That is just populism 101.

Like come on guys, this is obviously such a shaky ground to use as your fundament, and yet, it's somehow used as a major point over and over again. This just isn't a viable strategy long-term.

My main point is: you don't fight dictatorship with stabs at routine stuff. It's very easy to fake that for any proper dictator and score easy points against opposition. Forget about converting the ""economy first"" crowd into democrats, this isn't happening. They don't really care about it as much as they say they do. It's always been just an easy justification for staying bigoted.

Trump has already done so much real malicious harm to the world and his people, this egg-price angle just makes me sick and cheapens the rest of the points against him. Like really, is there no better thing to hammer away at?",SatanBakesPancakes,335,562,0.6800000071525574,0.175111941000098,1741332580,/r/changemyview/comments/1j5i2cq/cmv_the_whole_eggbased_rhetoric_against_trump_is/,2025,3
