1ky5bcm,CMV: It is high time we stop normalising islamism.,"We’ve had this discussion before, and I still stand by it, more strongly than ever: it’s high time we stop normalizing Islamism and start calling it what it is — a regressive, authoritarian ideology that stands in direct opposition to liberal democracy, secular values, and individual rights.

Let’s be clear. From systemic homophobia and deeply ingrained misogyny, to apologia for child marriage, terrorism, and ambitions for a global caliphate that would erase pluralism and national sovereignty — these are not fringe elements in Islamist discourse. They are core tenets. They are preached openly in mosques, embedded in school curricula in some countries, and often tolerated or downplayed in diaspora communities. These views are not “extreme” by accident — they stem from the fusion of politics with literalist religion.

And yet, somehow, in a grotesque twist of moral confusion, the Western liberal establishment continues to protect and even promote these ideologies under the banner of tolerance, multiculturalism, and inclusion. Left-liberals, who claim to stand for women’s rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and secular governance, suddenly become apologists when the violators of these principles cloak themselves in the garb of “minority rights.”

This selective outrage, this refusal to apply liberal principles universally, is not compassion — it is cowardice. It is betrayal. It’s a compromise of core democratic values in exchange for votes, virtue-signaling, and a hollow sense of moral superiority.

We must stop conflating criticism of Islamism with racism or bigotry. Islamism is not a race. It’s a political ideology — and like fascism or any other form of totalitarianism, it must be rejected outright, not coddled. Enough with the double standards. Enough with letting clerics who call for stoning or apostasy laws be treated as “community leaders.” Enough with allowing veiled theocracy to parade around as culture.

If someone openly supports Islamism, they are not simply expressing an opinion — they are rejecting democracy, secularism, and basic human rights. And they should be treated accordingly: with moral condemnation, not validation.

This is not a call for oppression. It is a call for clarity. Tolerance ends where intolerance begins. A liberal democracy cannot survive by embracing the very ideologies that seek to destroy it from within.",Middle_Exercise_1549,2710,2266,0.7599999904632568,0.6931823762433106,1748506300,/r/changemyview/comments/1ky5bcm/cmv_it_is_high_time_we_stop_normalising_islamism/,2025,5
1krvvrf,CMV: There is no realistic path to dismantling Israel as a Jewish state,"I rarely discuss Israel/Palestine. Made the mistake of trying to have a conversation in a thread full of people shouting 'Dismantle Israel' in a news sub and got permabanned. Feel free to check my comment history.

I understand it's a topic many people are passionate about, but so much of the 'discussion' is just screaming, with zero solutions that aren't just genocide. I am, sincerely, not seeing a realistic path forward where Israel is dismantled or radically reformed by outside forces. It's not like South Africa, where whites were a small minority ruling over a large majority of black people, and political and economic pressures were enough to eventually force a free election. It was a fragile, minority rule system to start with. But in Israel, right now, the population is ~75% Jewish. Even if we imagine adding the Palestinians of Gaza to the population, Jews will still be a majority. A free election in a combined Israel & Palestine would still look pretty close to what's already in place. Like what's the plan here? Because 'Two state solution' obviously is not what a lot of pro-Palestinian people have in mind. Not among protestors, and most definitely not on reddit. There is a very strong sentiment that Israel should just cease to be, rarely making any mention of what should happen to the people there.

You can't take the vote away from the Jews, because if you do, Hamas or something like it will win, and their *explicit* goals are to murder the entirety of the Jewish people in the region. Just look at the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund. The Gaza government loudly and openly paid the families of any muslim who murdered any Jew in Israel *for any reason*. Life in Gaza is abject misery right now, and half the population is *still* supporting the October 7th attacks. What exactly do people think will happen if the Palestinians are allowed to decide what happens to the Jews in Israel? That would just be an even bigger bloodbath than the current war.

So... what's the alternative? Expelling all the Jews? And send them where, exactly? Many of them are the children or grandchildren of Jews who were expelled from other Arab countries in the 20th century. You think sending them back to dictatorships that confiscated all their grandpa's property and kicked them out already is a good idea? No? Alright, you think we can find a country willing to take in 7 million Jews? No? Alright, should we forcibly split them up and guard to make sure they are only ever a small minority wherever they go? That hasn't worked out great, historically. Help me see a realistic solution here, people. I'm not condoning the actions of the IDF or the current Israeli government, but you have to be *for* something. You can't just shout ""From the River to the Sea"" and pretend 7 million Jews will just go away. Give me a sane, realistic path forward that doesn't devolve into a second holocaust.

For those who care, I am neither Jewish nor muslim nor living in Israel.",Rhamni,1325,3527,0.7400000095367432,0.6818556135053527,1747828332,/r/changemyview/comments/1krvvrf/cmv_there_is_no_realistic_path_to_dismantling/,2025,5
1kzv1tu,"CMV: Out of all the groups that immigrate to western countries, Muslim Arabs are hands down the worst at assimilating to western standards","I am saying this as an Exmuslim Arab myself and yes, I know there’s exceptions. I know they’re not all that way. But the painting is on the wall. I’m not saying anyone should abandon their religion, but integration is very important when you are moving to a new country. 

The reason why immigrants coming from let’s say Mexico or Latin America integrate so well is because western cultures aren’t that different and share similar values. The differences between traditional Islamic Arab culture and western culture are so astronomically different that conflict usually arises. Europe's weak stance on who they let in from the Middle East proves this, just look at Birmingham or at Malmo. 

People say ""racism"" and “Islamophobia” very loosely. If people are coming to your home country(pick many of the EU), causing chaos, pushing their own beliefs, killings, getting benefits from a western nation, etc. of course people are going to start getting pissed off. 

Muslim Arabs originally born in the Middle East are used to their thoughts and values being the majority. They get a little confused in melting pot western cultures where they encounter a lot of people with different views. They’re so indoctrinated to think one way that assimilation is nearly impossible. Try going and be a raging Christian in Saudi Arabia, wouldn’t work. You would have to assimilate. 

What you worship or your religion is your business, but to move to a new western nation and expect to force the laws and beliefs of your former nation is just peak disrespect. European countries shouldn’t have ‘no go zones’ because some immigrants refuse to adopt the host country's culture and values.

1kh3uxt,CMV: The far left is very effective at driving average people towards the right.,"Now when I say far left, I should clarify that I'm not talking about economic issues like wealth disparity. Those actually matter and are responsible for 99% of the problems the average person faces. Unfortunately the average person can't make the connection that someone else's life of ease/luxury costs them personally.

What people do seem to care about a lot are the social/cultural issues and that's where I think the left makes the most mistakes. Every argument I see is so hostile and emotional when it comes to these social issues that people who were otherwise middle of the road are pushed right. You can't agree with just 90% of the issue, if you don't agree with that remaining 10%, you're labeled a something-phobe and considered a target for cancellation. Obviously the right makes use of this, because it's really easy to point out how extremist that group is being. What were otherwise average people just end up voting against the group that attacks them.

One really good example of this is Reddit. This website censors a lot of social/cultural debate that's not biased towards the left. It's why a lot of topics are banned on a variety of subreddits. Anyone who was somewhat neutral gets pushed towards more right leaning subreddits, because despite some of them being filled with hateful people, at least they can discuss certain topics without bans.",Plomatius,1886,2544,0.6800000071525574,0.6194990357511067,1746640489,/r/changemyview/comments/1kh3uxt/cmv_the_far_left_is_very_effective_at_driving/,2025,5
1kvg6jv,CMV: Ruth Bader Ginsburg ultimately be remembered as a failure to her own ideals by not stepping down after her 2nd cancer diagnosis,"RBG was a crusader for civil rights. As a Supreme Court justice, she helped secure many freedoms for the American people. But her stubborn refusal to step down early in Obama's first term only served to undo her legacy of accomplishments. Recovering from cancer and continuing to work is admirable, but her first diagnosis was in 1999. When her second diagnosis occurred in 2009 and in a different part of her body, the correct decision would have been to allow a democratic president choose her replacement and maintain the balance on the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, she was a victim of her own pride and continued to sit on the bench, ultimately receiving 3 more cancer diagnoses (5 total) before her death in 2020. Her refusal to step away when Obama was in office enabled Trump to skew the court 6-3, and has resulted in multiple decisions that have since undone many of her accomplishments.

Because of her own pride, RBG enabled a far-right regime to cause irreparable damage to that nation. History will ultimately judge her more for this outcome than anything else she did.",steady_eddie215,3603,498,0.9100000262260437,0.5651082613470564,1748215995,/r/changemyview/comments/1kvg6jv/cmv_ruth_bader_ginsburg_ultimately_be_remembered/,2025,5
1kenjwy,CMV: the left is far too soft on Islam,The left is far too soft on Islam despite the implications of it continuing to grow in the West. I think the reason is because the people who believe in it are brown. The people who believe in it are immigrants. But these same people want to remove rights from gays and women. They want to force teaching of their Stone Age idiotic religion. They want to influence our politics. I see no issue with wanting this ideology gone. I see no issue with people being extremely against it. There’s a reason why so many gays supported the AFD in recent election.

1klk21c,CMV: USA taking in white South African refugees is racist in the context of Trump’s immigration policies,"At the start of his Presidency, Trump halted all refugee admissions to the U.S. However, he has since made an exception for white South Africans, specifically Afrikaners, citing “racial discrimination” and violence against white farmers following South Africa’s 2024 land reform law. 

Source: https://time.com/7284895/south-african-refugees-landed-trump

I’m unconvinced that white South Africans are the only group in the world that needs asylum in the USA.

My definition of racism is discrimination against people based on their ethnic or racial background.

To avoid any accusations of soapboxing: I do not have much knowledge of the lived experience of white South Africans. I also am unaware of any other valid reason that might make the US better equipped to help them.

1kngj7l,CMV: 99% of people would press the button that kills a random person but gives you a large amount of money.,"Here’s a common hypothetical that we’ve all seen before: 

“A button appears in front of you. If you press it, a million dollars will be deposited in your bank account. But a random person on the planet will die instantly.”

There are no drawbacks. No “black mirror” shenanigans. The IRS or whatever won’t get suspicious. What would you do?

I believe that 99% of people, me included, will press that button.

Yes, it’s evil. Yes, it’s selfish. But I have my reasons.

First of all, the vast majority of people would put themselves and their families above strangers. 

I’m not poor, but a million dollars would still get rid of like 95% the of the stress in my life. 

For a financially struggling person, it would literally change their entire life. 

Sorry random stranger, but I value my life over yours.

Second of all, there’s the cognitive dissonance involved.

You simply press a button and get your money. You don’t know who died, you didn’t see them die, you can’t even really confirm if anyone actually died. It’s entirely different than someone handing you a knife and having to actually get your hands dirty.

It’s similar to why non vegans don’t feel guilty when eating meat or other animal products. But most will if they had to kill an animal personally.

I guess the moral of the story is that money talks, and very few people are incorruptible .

1kh4w1f,CMV: AIPAC has no place in America,"The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has far too much control over U.S. politics. It doesn’t just lobby, it controls politicians, silences dissent, and ensures billions of American tax dollars fund a regime built on illegal occupation and apartheid.

Zionism, as it exists today, isn’t about peace. It’s a vile supremacist ideology rooted in colonialism and oppression. Israel’s right to exist should never mean justifying the massacre committed against civilians, yet that’s exactly what’s happening. While over 50,000 are dead and 100,000 wounded, the U.S. political system, under AIPAC’s grip, remains fixated on 200 hostages, treating their lives as more valuable. That is not justice. That is supremacy.

AIPAC distorts U.S. foreign policy to serve Israel’s interests at the expense of American values, global human rights, and basic human decency. It doesn’t represent the will of the American people, it represents a foreign agenda fueled by power, propaganda, and profit.

AIPAC is too powerful and they don’t serve America. They have no place in America. ",SuddenInteraction269,1423,1450,0.7200000286102295,0.40086319713474994,1746642936,/r/changemyview/comments/1kh4w1f/cmv_aipac_has_no_place_in_america/,2025,5
1ki79g9,"CMV: Universities are not making students liberal. The ""blame"" belongs with conservative culture downplaying the importance of higher education.","If you want to prove that Universities are somehow *making* students liberal, the best way to demonstrate that would be to measure the political alignment of Freshmen, then measure the political alignment of Seniors, and see if those alignments shifted at all over the course of their collegiate career. THAT is the most definitive evidence to suggest that Universities are somehow spreading ""leftist"" or ""left-wing"" ideology of some kind. And to my knowledge, this shift is not observed anywhere.

But yeah, ultimately this take that Universities are shifting students to the left has always kind of mystified me. Granted, I went to undergrad for engineering school, but between being taught how to evaluate a triple integral, how to calculate the stress in a steel beam, how to report the temperature at (x,y,z) with a heat source 10 inches away, I guess I must have missed where my ""liberal indoctrination"" must have occurred. A pretty similar story could be told for all sorts of other professions. And the only fields of study that are decidedly liberal are probably pursued largely by people who made up their minds on what they wanted to study well before they even started at their University.

Simply put, never have I met a new college freshman who was decidedly conservative in his politics, took some courses at his university, and then abandoned his conservatism and became a liberal shill by the time he graduated. I can't think of a single person I met in college who went through something like that. Every conservative I met in college, he was still a conservative when we graduated, and every liberal I met, he was still liberal when we graduated. Anecdotal, sure, but I sure as hell never saw any of this.

But there is indeed an undeniable disdain for education amongst conservatives. At the very least, the push to excel academically is largely absent in conservative spheres. There's a lot more emphasis on real world stuff, on ""practical"" skills. There's little encouragement to be a straight-A student; the thought process otherwise seems to be that if a teacher is giving a poor grade to a student, it's because that teacher is some biased liberal shill or whatever the fuck. I just don't see conservative culture promoting academic excellence, at least not nearly on the level that you might see in liberal culture. Thus, as a result, conservatives just do not perform as well academically and have far less interest in post-secondary education, which means that more liberals enroll at colleges, which then gives people the false impression that colleges are FORGING students into liberals with their left-wing communist indoctrination or whatever the hell it is they are accused of. People are being misled just by looking at the political alignment of students in a vacuum and not considering the real circumstances that led to that distribution of political beliefs. I think it starts with conservative culture.

1kgt7ag,"CMV: Western societies need to tolerate Islam less, not more.","This is specifically about Islam. I’m generally at odds with organized religion as a whole but among them, Islam stands out as the most ideologically aggressive, violent, and resistant to criticism. Christian or Jewish extremism exists, yes ,but there are levels to this. The scale, frequency, and institutional nature of violence or repression justified through Islamic teachings far surpass what we see from other faiths today.

And yet in Western societies, Islam is treated with extreme caution. Any open criticism is met with accusations of bigotry, and in some cases, violent threats and action. This creates a chilling effect where people self-censor not because they’re wrong, but because they’re afraid. That’s not tolerance, it’s submission.

I believe we should take concrete steps to reduce Islam’s ideological presence in the West:

**Restrict immigration** from Muslim-majority countries where this ideology is deeply embedded.

**Ban mosques** not because every single one is a threat, but because Islam doesn’t just use mosques for prayer. They often function as ideological centers where teachings can cross the line into political and social indoctrination. The potential for radicalization is built into the model. We don’t need structures that act as ideological distribution points for a system fundamentally at odds with our values.

**Protect speech critical of Islam** just as fiercely as we protect any other form of dissent. The current climate of fear is unacceptable in any society that values open discourse.

This is not about persecuting individuals. It’s about treating Islam the way we would treat any ideology that undermines liberal democratic values. We don’t tolerate Nazism. We don’t tolerate theocracy. So why does Islam, in its political and doctrinal form, get special treatment?

1l028yz,CMV: the origin of “Israel has no culture” discourse is Nazi propaganda penetrating the Muslim world.,"A big talking point of the pro Palestine crowd is that ""Israel has no culture it stole all of it culture from others.""
This is a very common idea in the Muslim world today.

My claim is that this is not part of Muslim tradition, and is an import from 20th century Nazi propaganda.

Why I’m convinced:
	•	Pre-modern Muslim writers bash Jews plenty, but never for “having no culture.” The insult shows up only after European antisemitic tracts (like Protocols) hit Arabic presses in the 1920s.
	•	Hitler’s Arabic radio + leaflets (Mufti of Jerusalem on the mic) hammered the “cultural parasite” line all through the war.
	•	Sayyid Qutb, Baʿth textbooks, and 1970s state media basically copy-pasted that language—and that’s what today’s memes echo.

1ks9e3g,CMV: Abortions should be legal because they do no appreciable harm when done properly,"I've thought about this topic from both sides and I honestly can't think of a legitimate argument for why abortion should be illegal. I'll present the arguments I've heard against abortions here and refute them in the ways I would argue.

""Every human being should have the right to life."" A human fetus really hasn't started living a human life yet. It's never laughed or cried or even seen the light of day. And if the mother wants to abort it, then it hasn't formed any meaningful social connections either. If I were to ask you what day you would consider to be the first day of your life, you'd say the day you were born, not the day you were conceived. If you're not even living a human life yet then you're not really a human being yet.

""Wait, but you just called it a human fetus back there! You're admitting it's a human being and therefore  it has the right to life!"" No, a human fetus isn't a human in the same way that human hair or a human hand isn't a human. Just because something is made of human cells doesn't make it a human being.

""A fetus is a baby, and you wouldn't kill a baby."" Calling a fetus a baby just goes against common sense.  No one in their right mind would place smashing a petri dish with a human IVF embryo in it and killing a baby on the same moral tier. It just goes against intuition. If you google image search ""baby,"" you would never find a picture of a fetus no matter how long you scrolled for.

""My religion says life begins at conception."" And I believe that it doesn't. We're both allowed to have our own beliefs, but beliefs don't form rational arguments. Logic and reason do.

""Abortion scars women for life."" Not getting an abortion when you don't want to give birth is even more scarring. No one gets an abortion because they like doing it, it's just the lesser of two evils.

""Some women die during abortions."" The WHO says ""Deaths from safe abortion are negligible, <1/100 000 *(5).* On the other hand, in regions where unsafe abortions are common, the death rates are high, at > 200/100 000 abortions."" I imagine unsafe abortions occur in places where abortion is illegal, but that's just my supposition. Either way, death by abortion doesn't seem like a huge issue.

I could list other counter-arguments I can refute, but I'll stop there. At the end of the day, women (and everyone for that matter) should be able to control the inner workings of their bodies as much as they can. That much seems like a common-sense human right to me. And lastly, what kind of a life could you expect to have if your own mother didn't want to have you? Abortions ensure that only babies that would be cared for and that are wanted would come into being. So being pro-choice isn't just being pro-choice, it's also being pro-love.

1klmg7r,CMV: President Trump should not accept the 400 million dollar jet from Qatar.,"Donald Trump should not accept the $400 million Boeing 747-8 jet gifted to him by the Qatari royal family. This decision is not merely controversial—it is unethical, unconstitutional, and a blatant affront to the very ideals of American sovereignty and integrity. 

Qatar has long been implicated in funding terrorism, with Trump himself acknowledging in 2017, “The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.” It has provided millions in direct aid to Hamas, hosted its leaders in Doha, and turned a blind eye to known terrorist financiers operating within its borders. Reports have linked Qatari charities to funding al-Qaeda, and wealthy donors from the country have bankrolled Taliban operations. Despite passing counterterrorism laws, Qatar continues to shelter extremists, making Trump’s acceptance of its gift not just unethical, but a serious security risk.

This jet is not a gesture of goodwill—it’s a bribe. Qatar is known for using its wealth to influence leaders who might serve its agenda. The idea that this plane is simply a donation to the United States is absurd. It will eventually be handed over to Trump’s presidential library, meaning it will become a personal asset. No matter how the administration tries to spin it, Qatar is giving Trump something of immense value, knowing it could influence his decisions in the future. 

Beyond ethics, this arrangement directly violates the U.S. Constitution. The Emoluments Clause explicitly forbids government officials from accepting gifts from foreign states. The distinction between gifting the aircraft to the Defense Department first and later passing it to Trump does not change the fundamental issue. Richard Briffault, a government ethics specialist, has noted that once the aircraft is transferred to Trump’s presidential library, it ceases to be a gift to the United States and becomes personal property. No matter how the administration attempts to justify this exchange, it remains a clear-cut example of unconstitutional foreign influence.

This move also contradicts everything Trump has claimed about putting “America First.” He has spent years criticizing foreign governments for exerting influence in U.S. politics. He once attacked Hillary Clinton for accepting money from Qatar (a one million dollar donation to the Clinton Foundation to celebrate Bill Clintons 65th birthday), yet now, he is gladly taking a gift worth $400 million from the same government. His company has also just announced plans for a luxury golf resort in the country. So is this decision based on America’s best interests or his own business ventures?

If Trump proceeds with accepting Qatar’s gift, he does so at the cost of American integrity, transparency, and security. There is no justification for this decision, and no legal loophole can disguise the corruption it represents.",HunterLazy3635,1425,863,0.8600000143051147,0.3179224991226849,1747144245,/r/changemyview/comments/1klmg7r/cmv_president_trump_should_not_accept_the_400/,2025,5
1kt66a7,CMV: we on the progressive left should be adding the “some” when talking about demographics like men or white people if we don’t want to be hypocritical.,"I think all of us who spend time in social bubbles that mix political views have seen some variants on the following:

“Men do X”

Man who doesn’t do X: “Not all men. Just some men.”

“Obviously but I shouldn’t have to say that. I’m not talking about you.”

Sometimes better, sometimes worse.

We spend a significant amount of discussion on using more inclusive language to avoid needlessly hurting people’s feelings or making them uncomfortable but then many of us don’t bother to when they’re men or white or other non-minority demographics. They’re still individuals and we claim to care about the feelings of individuals and making the tiny effort to adjust our language to make people feel more comfortable… but many of us fail to do that for people belonging to certain demographics and, in doing so, treat people less kindly because of their demographic rather than as individuals, which I think and hope we can agree isn’t right.

There are the implicit claims here that most of us on the progressive left do believe or at least claim to believe that there is value in choosing our words to not needlessly hurt people’s feelings and that it’s wrong to treat someone less kindly for being born into any given demographic.

I want my view changed because it bothers me when I see people do this and seems so hypocritical and I’d like to think more highly of the people I see as my political community who do this. I am very firmly on the leftist progressive side of things and I’d like to be wrong about this or, if I’m not, for my community to do better with it.

What won’t change my view: 

1) anything that involves, explicitly or implicitly, defining individuals by their demographic rather than as unique individuals. 

2) any argument over exactly what word should be used. My point isn’t about the word choice. I used “many” in my post instead and generally think there are various appropriate words depending on the circumstances. I do think that’s a discussion worth having but it’s not the point of my view here.

3) any argument that doesn’t address my claim of hypocrisy. If you have a pragmatic reason not to do it, I’m interested to hear it, but it doesn’t affect whether it’s hypocritical or not.

1keqtit,CMV: it’s perfectly reasonable to drop friends over political views,"I’ll start by clarifying that I’m a leftist, and that will inform a lot of the examples I use, but I don’t think you need to be a leftist to agree with me here. 
Lots of people, admittedly less these days, talk about how silly it is to stop being friends with someone or dislike someone over their political views. I don’t agree. People who say this act as if politics are some given trait or private matter like religion or culture, when it’s inherently not. Especially in a democratic country, a person’s political views have an impact on the society they are a part of. Yes, people inherit their beliefs from their family or whatever sometimes, but ultimately political views are rarely arbitrary, people tend to have reasoning to support theirs. I want to exclude from this people who clearly haven’t critically engaged with their views or politics. If you grew up in a republican household for example, and you study engineering and kind of just follow headlines, you aren’t really responsible for those views. Also, I mean this more for close friends. If you run in the same circles as someone you disagree with, there’s no reason to make an issue of it if they’re not someone you’re close with, trust, or love, ect.  
I’m not just talking about hateful or extreme views though, like thinking that gay people are sinful or supporting the deportation of green card holders for expressing their beliefs. Even basic beliefs about tax structure, regulations, or welfare. Just because those aren’t as flashy/provocative, doesn’t make them unimportant (they are often more impactful and broad in reach even). Like I said, I’m generally a leftist. If you are a “moderate” or believe in fiscal/macroeconomic policy that maintains the status quo, I think I should be totally justified in having a problem with that. 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and you believe that’s okay? Thats your right, but to me it shows we don’t have the same values (even ethically speaking) and I don’t want to have a close relationship with you. 
Let’s say you’re right libertarian leaning, and you think a too powerful state poses an existential risk, or maybe you think property is a god given right and wealth redistribution violates natural law or something (sorry if this sounds like a straw man for the right, that’s not my point though. If your friend believes in lots of regulation and democratic socialism, I think you have a good reason not to want to be close friends with them. 
Look, I’m not saying you should do this. I have lots of friends I disagree with about this stuff and I’m willing to look past it. I just think politics are a legitimate reason to end or loosen a relationship with someone.

1knmzjy,CMV: Bachelor's degrees today are what high school diplomas were 40 years ago.,"A high school diploma 40 years ago could get you almost any job that didn't require advanced degree (e.g. MD/DO, JD, VMD, and etc.). But if you look at job postings today for jobs that didn't require any higher education such as receptionist, data entry, retail manager, and etc. have some sort of higher education requirement or strong preference. Someone could live comfortably with a high school diploma job in the middle class up until the 80s.

In the 1980s the high school graduation rate hovered in the lower 70 percent range. Fast forward today, it is now upper 80 percent and in some areas its upper 90 percent. Now does that mean student have become more studious, scholarly, or our education system have drastically improved? Most middle schoolers today probably read and write at a grade school level and can't solve basic quadratic equations let alone any algebraic problems.

One could argue the education system since the 80s has made more strive to be equitable and inclusive to everyone and resulted in artificially pumped up graduation rates so that schools could receive more praise, funding, and attention. We awarded more for less.

Bachelor degrees are now seen as the only viable path to middle class but yet most have a negative ROI if you factor in the cost of attendance and the compounding interest from student loans. No one should have to go college to live a middle-class life. If you want to move up into higher socioeconomic tax bracket then that is what college should be for.

1kyairx,"CMV: The Islamic Golden Age was driven by individual geniuses, not Islamic orthodoxy—and modern glorification of it is dishonest","**Note that this text was translated from Arabic to English by AI and I reviewed it and edited some parts too**  
**---**

I've come to believe that much of the praise Arab Muslims today give to the so-called ""Islamic Golden Age"" is misguided. It treats a handful of brilliant thinkers—like Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Al-Razi (Rhazes), Al-Khwarizmi, and Ibn Rushd (Averröes)—as if they were the natural products of Islamic orthodoxy or Arab culture, when in fact many of these scholars were marginalized, persecuted, or even declared heretics in their time by the very religious and political institutions Muslims now revere.

  
My view is based on several key points:

* **Many of these scholars were persecuted**, not celebrated, in their time. Al-Razi criticized religion and was reportedly blinded by mobs incited by clerics. Ibn Rushd’s books were burned, and he was exiled. Ibn Sina was condemned by Al-Ghazali and accused of heresy.
* **Most were not Arabs**, and many weren't even working within Arab-dominated systems. Persian, Central Asian, and Turkish scholars made some of the biggest contributions, often in relatively tolerant courts like the Buyids or early Fatimids—not under the more orthodox Sunni caliphates. Labeling their work “Arab” or purely “Islamic” science erases the diverse and often non-Arab environments that enabled their ideas.
* **Orthodox Islam turned against philosophy and rationalism.** Thinkers like Al-Ghazali (Algazelus) or Ibn Taymiyya  argued that reason must submit to revelation, which helped shut down the momentum of intellectual inquiry. Theologians who attacked science and philosophy are ironically treated as heroes today, while the thinkers they suppressed are also glorified—this contradiction makes no sense to me.
* **Modern Arab-Muslim societies don’t carry on this legacy.** If Islamic civilization truly had a systemic, religiously-driven scientific culture, why didn’t that legacy continue? Why are major scientific contributions today mostly coming from secular or Western systems? It seems to me that the original scholars were outliers who thrived *in spite of*, not because of, dominant religious culture.

In short, the actual drivers of scientific progress during the Islamic Golden Age were not mainstream Islamic institutions but rather individual genius, cultural cross-pollination (Greek, Indian, Persian), and relatively liberal courts. The glorification of this period by modern Muslims often ignores the uncomfortable truth that mainstream orthodoxy largely opposed or suppressed this intellectual flowering.

  
One more thing I'd like to add that wasn't in my original Arabic text:  
It is also worth noting that many of these scholars, received support not from orthodox Sunni sects, but from non-orthodox Muslim groups like the Shi'i Buyids or even early Fatimids \[whom I myself don't support\], these dynasties most of the time provided MORE intellectually tolerant environments and societies that actually valued rationality and science. Again, while I may not personally align with their theology, it's clear as the sun that they actually created conditions in which rationalist inquiry and scientific advancement are accepted and celebrated, unlike the more rigid circles that later dominated Sunni orthodoxy

  
Why I hold this view:  
I believe the Islamic Golden Age is often misrepresented by most modern Arab Muslims. Many of the scientists and philosophers now celebrated were persecuted by religious authorities of their time. Thinkers were exiled or attacked, not embraced. Most weren’t even Arab, and many were supported by non-orthodox Muslim courts, like the Buyids and Fatimids, that tolerated rationalism, while Orthodox Islam later rejected this intellectual legacy. So I think glorifying it today feels dishonest",Thormosphere_,1578,204,0.800000011920929,0.24549950380815855,1748524548,/r/changemyview/comments/1kyairx/cmv_the_islamic_golden_age_was_driven_by/,2025,5
1kfok4r,CMV: The US should not be supporting Israel.,"**I am going to make this case purely off of how Israel has acted towards the West, and NOT their war crimes in the Gaza strip or occupation zones or anything like that.**

This is for 2 reasons:

1. because many Western readers may not be as concerned with the Palestine issue (understandable, as it doesn't directly affect their daily lives as much as the climate crisis or social issues),
2. and because Israel often claims that the ICC and the rest of the world courts are biased against Israel, so we'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they're correct and aren't committing even a single crime against Palestinians.

so I will try to make the case that Israel's violations **towards Western powers alone** should be the reason we cut funding to that country.

* Israel [does not honor US sanctions on Russia](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/netanyahu-governments-approach-russia-and-ukraine) in response to the Ukraine invasion, making it the only US ally to do so. They continue full trade with them against the request of the US, as US-led NATO is actively trying to repel the Russian invasion in Ukraine and negotiate to end the war.
* Not only that, they go even further and demand the US allows [Russia to be able to keep their military bases in Syria](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-lobbies-us-keep-russian-bases-weak-syria-sources-say-2025-02-28/) following the deposition of Omar al-Bashir.
   * (Russia literally [funds Iran and Hamas](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/russias-relationship-hamas-and-putins-global-calculations) btw)
   * And they do it by lobbying US politicians so we have no choice but to comply with their demands.

After all the funding they’ve received from American taxpayers, they have used it to

* [steal nuclear ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_affair)materials and secrets from the US,
* possess nuclear weapons
   * but gets upset if[ other countries try to](https://x.com/AIPAC/status/1919467904359157963?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet).
* in 2002, [Israel advocated for invasion of Iraq using 300 thousand US soldiers](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/04/opinion/taking-apart-iraq-s-nuclear-threat.html) (US invaded Iraq in 2003)
   * also generally participated in the Saddam Hussein WMD misinformation campaign against US citizens
* and straight up [attacked the USS Liberty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident),
   * we invaded [Mexico because they accidentally arrested a group of US sailors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampico_Affair) and released them an hour later with an apology, then they refused to perform a 21-gun salute to the American flag at the request of a US admiral.
   * we invaded Grenada because they were [building an airport](https://www.projectcensored.org/12-the-grenada-invasion-a-classic-case-of-censorship/) that looked like it could be used to attack the US. Every other Caribbean country at this time already had an airport, as they rely heavily on their tourist industries.

Israel is the largest recipient of [US aid of any country (post WW2)](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-military-aid-does-the-us-give-to-israel/), even compared to Ukraine ([USD 180 billion](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)).

If someone comes to your door right now, and says: ""Hi, we would like you to sign our petition. Right now you can send USD 4 billion of aid to Israel, it'll just go on the deficit and US taxpayers will have their taxes increased to cover the cost."" What do you think the percentage of Americans would be who vote ""yes"" on that petition?

Well, it doesn't matter! Just last week, [Trump did just this](https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/trump-sidesteps-congress-giving-billions-to-israel/), and even better, he just did it! [No congress or anything](https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/trump-sidesteps-congress-giving-billions-to-israel/)!

So this is assuming that Israel is completely correct in saying the rest of the world is simply wrong for condemning their actions in the Gaza strip and the West Bank ([they call it ""Judean Sumeria""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89GVWT-Dbys&t=1695s)\*yes, seriously. skip to 33:30 in video\* because that's what it used to be called in 1200 BC, 3000 years ago, when Jews lived there, so they believe this land belongs to them from birth, their so called ""birth-right"" to the land).

Things like:

* There’s this “all or nothing” vibe, where if you disagree with one part, suddenly you’re not an ally anymore.
* And the public shaming stuff — even when people are clearly trying to grow or figure things out — just doesn’t feel productive. It starts to feel more about calling people out than actually changing minds.

To be clear, I’m not saying people should get a pass for being racist, sexist, or anything like that. I just think some of the tactics used end up pushing away people who might otherwise support the cause.

While I understand why (it’s pretty tough to have a good reputation globally when Trump is your president), it’s starting to feel to me like just another flavor of American arrogance. The idea that America is the ultimate hero and that they are the ultimate villain comes from the same place. Blaming every global conflict, every global economic downturn, and every unfavorable cultural movement on the US is just reinforcing the idea that America is the center of the world, and that other countries don’t have their own agency and culture. 

I’ve seen people blame both the Israel/Palestine and Russia/Ukraine wars on the US (they’ve obviously played a part in these wars, but let’s not act like those countries don’t have their own agency and make their own decisions). I’ve seen people blame anti-blackness on the US (as if the US invented racism, and it doesn’t exist in every country on earth).

For those of you who don't know who Miss Rachel is, she's a YouTuber who sings saccharine sweet songs.  I personally don't care much for her but my little girls can't get enough of it.

Miss Rachel showcased some Palestinian children who have been mutilated in the Gazan war and called for a cease fire.  In response some conservatives are trying to label her as an antisemite and to get her cancelled.  The author of the article I linked to (who I assume if progressive) is calling out said right-wing media figures for their hypocrisy - and rightly so in my opinion - as these were the same people who once championed themselves as defenders of free speech in the face of ""woke tyranny"" and cancel culture.

Now, while I do agree with the entire premise of the article, I feel it would be remiss to not acknowledge that there absolutely have been progressive-minded Americans who have sought to silence points of view that they disagree with from spaces that they control.  Deplatforming comedians who make certain kinds of jokes, disinviting campus speakers who express right of center opinions, or calling for journalists to lose their jobs for writing pieces critical of left wing orthodoxy was - and still is - very much a thing.

This got me to thinking, why are even playing this game of gotcha?  Why are we pointing fingers and saying, ""Look! Look! This side says that they support free speech but really they don't!""

It really isn't that hard to be in favor of free speech and to be consistent in your support for unadulterated expression, regardless of your political views. All you really have to do is say this to yourself:

***""I accept that other people may have opinions that I find upsetting and that make me uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean I should try to keep them from speaking to an audience that wants to hear them"".***

And before we go any further, I want to make it very clear that I am ***not*** talking about the First Amendment.  I am talking about a belief if the right to speak one's mind that transcends legality.  I absolutely understand that a social media platform like Reddit or an NFL team like the San Francisco 49ers or a streaming service like Netflix has every **right** to remove whoever they want for any reason - just was we citizens have the **right** to call for people to be deplatformed or fired...but that does not mean that we **should**.  Sort of like you have the **right** to cheat on your spouse, you have the **right** to ridicule your children but you **should** not do those things, right?  They are morally wrong.

There are exceptions of course.  The main ones that I can think of are as follows:

1. **Calling for actual immediate physical harm** \- So standing in front of an angry mob and calling for them to burn down your neighbor's house.  This cannot be tolerated in any circumstance.
2. **Telling lies that will lead to physical or material damage** \- Classic case is shouting ""fire!"" in a crowded theater, of course, but it could also be telling an old lady that you have kidnapped her son and that she needs to empty her bank account to save him.  There is no place for speech of that sort.
3. **Harassment** \- People have a right to live their lives in peace without being insulted and defamed.  Therefore, putting a sign on your neighbor's lawn stating that he is a child molester or calling someone slurs is not acceptable in my opinion.  People who behave this way on social media sites should be banned accordingly.  No problem there. 
4. **Preventing a discussion from happening** \- Let's say you are at poetry reading and a person stands up and starts banging pots and pans so that no one can hear what the poet says.  The bookshop would be morally in the right to remove such a person.  Similarly, if you go on a subreddit devoted to a certain topic, let's say r/modeltrains, and all you do is disparage their hobby, you should be banned.  You are not keeping in the spirit of their group.  But if you have a sub devoted to r/politics or r/worldnews...I think you ought to really allow a very wide range of opinions, even the ones that are not popular with most of the user base.

And this is really where I think the problem comes in, people from all kinds of political stripes have come to see viewpoints they disagree with as actual harm or damage or harassment - **when they are not.**  They are simply upsetting.

Bringing this back to poor Miss Rachel, the example in the article is a classic case.  There is a war in the Levant and supporters of Israel see any kind of sympathy for Palestinians - even if its for amputee children - as an existential threat.  Just as supporters of Palestine see sympathy for Israel - even if its for rape victims, - as intolerable.  But in each case the partisans are wrong.  It's OK to express support or admiration for either side and people who don't like it ought to be ready to tolerate it, particularly if they are not actually participating in the conflict.  It's not an easy issue.  A war is a very disturbing event.  

And the same goes for abortion, and gun violence, and police shootings, and the history of slavery and the memory of the Civil War and ***any*** kind of joke and on and on.

We live in a world with a lot of different points of view.  Sometimes we are going to be upset and while that might hurt a bit, we ought not to try to make people shut up.

1kh09qd,"CMV: The global outrage over some civilian deaths while ignoring others reveals selective morality, not true empathy.","I believe the world shows selective outrage when it comes to civilian casualties in conflict zones. When children die in Gaza or Ukraine, there's a global outpouring of sympathy, hashtags, media coverage, and activism. But when Indian civilians or soldiers are killed in terrorist attacks like Pulwama, Uri, or 26/11 the same energy is almost never seen.

It feels like empathy is being filtered through political trends. If you're aligned with what's seen as the ""popular"" or ""correct"" cause, your grief is validated. But if you're from a country like India and your attackers are tied to state-sponsored terrorism from Pakistan, suddenly it's seen as ""complicated,"" and global sympathy becomes muted or absent.

I'm not saying we shouldn’t care about innocents in other countries we absolutely should. But I question why grief and outrage seem so inconsistent. If terrorism is wrong, it should be wrong no matter who the victims are. And if dead children are a tragedy, then that truth should be universal not selective.

Then I started owning dogs and I realized how much their personality has nothing to do with their owner and everything to do with their breed. I had a golden retriever who had aggression issues with other dogs. Had him from a puppy. We did lots of training multiple classes at PetSmart, he was spoiled, got tons of exercise, great food, lots of love but he liked his space and we were never able to ""work out"" his aggression. He had his own opinions and a BIG personality. We just kept him on a short leash but the aggression was always there until he died of cancer. Then I looked around and realized that the aggression is super common with goldens. At the same time I have an Aussie mutt. Same treatment, best dog in the world, perfect angel, super smart.

1kfaxhw,CMV: Arab countries are pretty terrible at protecting their religious and ethnic minorities.,"Whether they are a religious or ethnic minority group, minorities are persecuted and treated as worse than second class citizens. 

The biggest example of the Jews, they were always treated badly in Arab countries, even before Israel existed like Farhud massacre in Iraq (1941) and Hebron massacre (1834), in fact half of Israel population is Mizrahi Jews (MENA Jews) who fled their countries because of Arabs persecuting. There barely any jews left in Arab world while other Muslims nations like Turkey (15k Jews) and Iran (10k Jews) still have thousands of Jews living there. 


Same thing with Christians, Israel is the only MENA country with growning Christian population, attacks against Christians are big problem in Arabic world, there always a news about Christian being killed there and church being bombed. Even under secular Arab regimes like Saddam and Assad, Assyrian names were banned and speaking in Aramaic was discouraged. Coptic language (the native langauge of Egypt) has no native speakers and only used in praying. Amazigh langauges (indigenous langauges of North Africa) are all endangered and some of them got extinct, Libya even banned speaking them under Gaddafi. 


Kurds despite being Muslims are also heavily discriminated in Syria and Iraq, they have been massacre against Kurds (also Assyrians) by Arabs from over century like the Anfal genocide in iraq where 200k Kurdish civlians have been killed. Kurdish langauge and culture (like Newroz holiday) have been oppressed in Iraq and Syria since 60s and there are over 300k Kurds in Syria whom are still stateless to this day.


Since the fall of Assad, Alawites have victim of genocides where many alawite dozens were fullly ethnic cleansed leaving no alawites left and over 31k alawites took refuge in Lebanon and the number is still gorwimg every day. Druze also are persecuted there have been dozens of attacks against them since Assad fall of and they have even called for autonomous region in Syria and support from Israel because they don't trust Sunni Arabs to protect them, same thing in Israel, Israeli duze are very pro-Israel because Palestinians used to persecute them before Israel existed. 


And lasty, there's way more Iraqi mandeans in US, Sweden and Australia than Iraq, it shows how Arab countries failing at protecting  their minorities.

I made the argument that by denying due process with the intent to limit that to only illegal immigrants means that there's no protection against it's application against citizens since if law enforcement can deport people without seeing a judge, citizens could be sent to foreign prisons without being able to prove they're citizens and didn't commit a crime. Even if you think the Trump administration can be trusted not to deport citizens critical of the government, do you trust all future administrations with such a precedent?

1kcxb89,CMV: It takes more faith in Paul to believe in modern Christianity than in Jesus,"When I read the Gospels, Jesus appears as a Jewish teacher preaching repentance, Torah observance, and the coming Kingdom of God. His message was specific, grounded in Jewish law, and aimed at a Jewish audience. There’s no Trinity, no salvation by faith alone, and no outright dismissal of the Law. But then Paul enters the picture, someone who never met Jesus in life and who redefines the entire framework.

Paul’s writings pivot from Jesus’ teachings to doctrines like grace over law, justification by faith, and a divine Christ figure who replaces obedience with belief. It’s Paul who opens the door to Gentiles and pushes a theology that would be unrecognizable to most first-century Jews. Today’s Christianity, especially in its Protestant forms, leans more on Paul’s interpretation than on Jesus’ own words.

To me, believing in modern Christianity requires trusting Paul’s authority and vision more than Jesus’ teachings. That doesn’t sit right with me. I’m open to being challenged on this, but I don’t think the historical Jesus ever intended the religion that bears his name to become what it is now.

1kmro5m,"CMV: If President Trump suspends Habeas Corpus, he will use it to suppress his opponents.","So, Stephen Miller has stated that he and the Trump admin are considering suspending Habeas Corpus (the right to a due trial) to accelerate the deportation of illegal immigrants.

Keep in mind that I'm not saying that he will arrest Hakeem Jeffries or kill Gavin Newsom or whatever. But I think he will arrest small-scale protesters and activists. 

I think this because Trump is just aggressive to people that he doesn't like or dislikes him. This is proved by the Mahmoud Khalil and Roma Uzurk arrests, just for protesting conservative politicies. 

So, if he doesn't show restraint against them, why would he for others? However, it will be worse because 1) suspending Habeas Corpus will cause more protests and 2) now they won't be able to challenge their arrest.

1kqbzag,CMV: Not having things in common is a bad argument against age gap dating,"I always see it as a big talking point  “I don’t know what a 40 year old could have in common with a 24 year old” but that’s just ignorant. Has no one here ever been close with older relatives, co workers, peers etc? I’m in my early 20’s and a guy in nursing school and I’ve met women from younger then me to in there 50’s I have plenty of stuff in common with.

1klr1ed,"CMV: if there is a single thing Trump is right about, it’s the fact that NATO member states need to uphold their 2% spending financial commitments.","Before I get into my arguments, no I do not sympathize with Trump or his supporters in any way, shape, or form. Mr Trump and his administration seem to have genuine malicious intent. I politically consider myself to be center, I lean left on some issues and lean right on others. That being said, Mr Trump is not right. He is ultranationalist-level far right. Not a single one of my policy views align with his except the fact that NATO member states are acting in bad faith and need to face consequences if they do not comply with their commitments. 

While not binding, NATO member states have made formal commitments to spend at least 2% of their annual GDP on national defence. Given escalating tensions globally now (e.g., Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, Russia and Ukraine), it has become more important than ever for NATO allies to stand together in case things cascade into full-scale war. Unfortunately, many NATO member states seem to be free-riding on the NATO defence benefits—especially since a majority of spending is done by the U.S.—by contributing significantly less than 2% of their GDP to defence. Many do not even have a roadmap to reach that benchmark. Agreeing to do something, then failing to follow through while continuing to benefit from the security umbrella provided by others, is an act of bad faith and creates what in politics is known as the free-rider problem. The U.S. spends a disproportionate share of its annual budget on defence, while some ally states contribute little more than token amounts. This not only breeds resentment but also undermines the credibility and reliability in the alliance.

1kd3inn,CMV: The Allies were right to drop the nuclear bombs on Japan at the end of WWII,"The Allies decided to drop two nuclear bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in order to try and force Japan to surrender and therefore end WWI. My view is that this was morally the right decision, admittedly an incredibly difficult decision, but the right one. I do not believe nuclear bombs are the answer in basically any situation. I am not debating whether they should exist or be used in the future, just in this particular instance.

If we look purely at estimated death figures, on the high end there are 246,000 deaths from the 2 nuclear bombs (yes I understand many more lives will have been implicated), compared to estimations in the millions on BOTH sides (Allies and Japanese) for a land invasion of Japan. I understand the dangers of a utilitarian perspective, but if we look purely at the numbers they are not even comparable. A quarter of a million compared to multiple millions, when by this point of the conflict an estimated 70-85 million people had already died. I cannot begrudge the Allies for wanting to reduce the overall death toll, and the best way to do that was to end the war as quickly as possible, and in this case that meant using nuclear weapons.

I think in arguments against this, many people also misunderstand the Japanese point of view. Not only were they almost entirely set against surrendering, there was very little structure within the upper echelons of Japanese government/military. We can see this from the Tokyo War Crime Trials, where they all basically refuse to answer questions, claim they didn't have authority over anything, and someone else was in charge. Whilst this does show general chaos of wartime command, it also explains the lack of accountability taken by many of the Japanese following WWII. We can also see how badly some of the Japanese did not want to surrender even after the two bombs were dropped, as there was an attempted coup by some army officers to prevent Hirothi's broadcast accepting defeat. In this speech, the lack of accountability can be seen, as Hirothi claimed there was no intention to ""infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to embark on territorial aggrandisement"" which is just a blatant lie. As recently as 2015, conservative voices in Japan have lobbied Japanese Prime Ministers to reflect that Japans actions were not aggressive or illegitimate. I understand this reflects a minuscule portion of the country, and am by no means saying that Japan is not sorry for the crimes they committed, but it is concerning that this view is still circling around government circles.

There are also the environmental impacts to consider. Mainly the consequences caused by radiation. However, the radiation created from nuclear bomb testing is greater than that created from these two bombs. I understand that those tests were not done on densely populated areas, so the effects of these two will remain greater. I will admit that this is the weakest point of my argument, as there are clear environmental impacts. I just believe the overall lower death toll is of greater significance than the environmental impacts that occurred.

I am willing to change my view on this. Have I underestimated the environmental impact? Do you think even with the lower death toll dropping the nuclear bombs was still morally wrong? If so, why? Again, I am not debating the existence of nuclear bombs, just when they were used to end WWII.

  
EDIT: Thank you everyone for your contributions, I am pleased to say my mind has mostly been changed on this issue. Thank you for mostly a pleasant and intriguing discussion. I posted this as I wanted to have my view challenged, and your contributions have been very helpful. I have tried to respond to and engage with as many of you as possible. I have awarded multiple deltas to people that have brought new things to my attention, or have convinced me that things were more important than I had given them credit for. In no particular order I will list below factors behind my change in view. 

1. 3 days between the two bombs was not long enough 

2. I underestimated the impact of the Soviets, and the effect they had on a potential Japanese surrender, in light of this, the bombs were less necessary 

3. US being unreasonable by demanding unconditional surrender. Whilst I may understand the potential logic behind this, I had not given adequate thought as to how this would've affected Japan's willingness to surrender 

4. Other motivations behind dropping the bombs, aka a dick swinging contest with the Soviets 

5. Bombs or land invasion were not the only two options. There were other options, every options had their drawback but this was not a binary choice as I had originally presented it

6. The bombs could've been dropped on unpopulated areas/military targets 

These are all valid points, and thank you for bringing them to my attention. I will now no longer be responding to comments. ",MiddleAndLeg_,408,476,0.6800000071525574,0.12347724829461537,1746199012,/r/changemyview/comments/1kd3inn/cmv_the_allies_were_right_to_drop_the_nuclear/,2025,5
1kzvm77,CMV: I think incels & redpill bros make dating easier for nice guys,"I know it sounds silly, but I think maybe I owe my life to incels & ""red pill"" toxic men

Recently me & my wife celebrated our wedding anniversary. She told me that she couldn't believe she lucked into marrying me, and it's a statement that is on the one hand absolutely absurd - she's beautiful, caring, has a good job, is a wonderful mother & wife, while I am far less attractive, make less money and could probably reasonably be described as ""a weird nerd"". Still, this woman feels like she's the lucky one to be with me. And the funny thing is I completely believe her.

When we exchanged dating stories in the past hers just seem so terrible, while mine are like ""we went on a few dates, didn't work out"". I think this is why I feel my own path to her was just meeting a few women who just weren't for me but were good experiences overall, while she was living a nightmare of the worst guys in the world until she lucked into me - not the worst guy in the world. Jackpot!

And this has been my experience with a lot of the women I went out with - women who seemed genuinely happy to be going out with me  after having a lot of bad experiences.

And this is why I think all those redpill bros & incels might have actually helped me out a lot. They keep trying to ""science"" the subject of dating, a very subjective individual experience, but in doing so may have created a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy. One metaphor I keep seeing in that context is the one of supply & demand. So... A lot of the paradigms they operate under actually act as self sabotage (like making a woman feel beautiful, safe & comfortable are considered bad things in those circles? Like that whole ""girls don't like nice guys l"" thing?). If we bring it back to that market metaphor - I might have really benefited from the disparity between supply and demand by being not a huge asshole in a market absolutely flooded with huge assholes. 

And it seems to hold true - being a reasonably nice dude seems to make me really appealing to women even now. I get looks. I get flirted with. I get complimented a lot for being a good husband & good dad. I feel like hot shit, and objectively I'm probably not. I married way up. It's absolutely silly that the woman I lucked into marrying thinks she married into me, and I think the way a lot of men (not all men, obviously) behave might have significantly contributed to that. I think all those guys might have accidentally stumbled into being right. Women don't want to date them. But it's likely because they are bitter & hate them, which causes them to become even more bitter & hateful, onboarding new guys into being bitter & hateful, and that makes dating much easier for those who have absolutely any amount of chill.

I have never felt more like women really go for nice guys (actually nice guys, not assholes pretending to be nice), and the more people insist it's not true, the easier time actual nice guys are likely to have with women as long as they manage to avoid growing bitter & resentful ",Orgalop,533,326,0.7599999904632568,0.1193689074852627,1748693491,/r/changemyview/comments/1kzvm77/cmv_i_think_incels_redpill_bros_make_dating/,2025,5

I try to incorporate the American flag and red white and blue into my life as much as possible, and encourage my peers to do the same. I get that I might be mistaken for maga, and that is my point. The flag represents all of us, and they dont get to claim it as their symbol. 

Today, I saw a TikTok about a veteran that has flown a flag since 9/11, but he took it down on November 6 last year. There were hundreds of comments supporting this and saying they did the same. 

I didn't serve so I don't have that perspective. I want to respect all military personnel, past or present, and show my American pride. Is going flagless the better option until 2029?",yagot2bekidding,340,455,0.75,0.11116724665322475,1747508486,/r/changemyview/comments/1kp0iln/cmv_the_american_flag_represents_all_americans/,2025,5
1ke7mno,cmv: the ruling class wants to keep the poor divided and working to their bones so they have zero time to organize and stand united against them,"The ruling class, throughout history and into the present, benefits from maintaining a fragmented and overworked lower class. 

By fostering division—whether through race, religion, nationality, or political ideology—they ensure that the poor see one another as adversaries rather than recognizing their shared struggle. 

Simultaneously, by structuring economic systems that always threaten job security with layoffs, demand long hours, multiple jobs, and constant financial precarity, they exhaust the working class mentally and physically. This relentless grind leaves little time or energy for collective reflection, education, or organization. In this state of disunity and fatigue, the poor are less likely to mobilize, protest, or challenge the systems that keep them oppressed—thus allowing the ruling class to retain power, wealth, and control with minimal resistance.",Conscious-Quarter423,537,243,0.8399999737739563,0.10815153187508215,1746319557,/r/changemyview/comments/1ke7mno/cmv_the_ruling_class_wants_to_keep_the_poor/,2025,5
1kjy7xa,"CMV: Pakistan should not have nukes , and is a failed military dictatorship only surviving thanks to loans and aid","People say that Pakistan developed nukes for security , but the question that arises is , security against whom ? China supports them to keep India in check , and India has literally declared a No First Use policy that states that they would not use their nuclear weapons unless attacked first.   
In contrast to that , Pakistan refused to adopt the NFU policy claiming that they have the right to attack first with nukes .   
Even if we somehow believe that Pakistan obtained those nukes to promote peace , their actions right after obtaining them show that they want war . (They started the Kargil war and attacked India right after obtaining nukes)   
Pakistan also sold Nuclear Centrifuge designs to North Korea , Iran ... Let's also not forget where Osama Bin Laden was found hiding .   
And every time Pakistan is close to default , IMF gives it another loan or restructures the loan to prevent collapse . They recently approved a 1 Billion loan to Pakistan even after a war that Pakistan started   
Pakistan is also a military dictatorship , if y'all don't believe me , read up on how not even 1 Prime Minister there has completed their term .   
tldr-Pakistan should not have nukes , and is a failed military dictatorship only surviving thanks to loans and aid",Maleficent-Show4948,304,460,0.6499999761581421,0.10693508163875382,1746960450,/r/changemyview/comments/1kjy7xa/cmv_pakistan_should_not_have_nukes_and_is_a/,2025,5
1knit77,CMV: American Tipping is toxic and you're not actually paying for any service.,"Frank and Joe go out to eat together.

Frank gets a water, refilled twice and burger.
Joe gets 2 cocktails and a steak.

They get separate checks.

Frank tips $3.00 on his $12.00 check. (25%)
Joe tips $6.00 on his $60.00 check (10%)

Joe paid TWICE as much as Frank did for the exact same service (actually less service because he got one less drink delivered to him), and yet most people will consider Joe a cheap asshole. 

If you pay for the food and tip for the service, why is the tip based on the food?

It's just a scam to get as much money out of you as they can, because it's easier to slip in a bigger tip expectation into a larger amount. 

If you want to CMV, explain how and why Joe is a cheap asshole without using any ""Well that's just the way it is"" logic.",aLazyUsername69,399,351,0.7900000214576721,0.10452156031573537,1747341715,/r/changemyview/comments/1knit77/cmv_american_tipping_is_toxic_and_youre_not/,2025,5
