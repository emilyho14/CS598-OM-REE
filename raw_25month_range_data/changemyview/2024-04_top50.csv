1bz23lw,CMV: A minor lying about their age on a dating app is NOT a victim.,"I need to explain fully what I mean. Let’s say you’re on a dating app, take Grindr for example. Then you start talking with a person who says they’re 18 and looks 18, and you start sexting. Let’s then say it turns out the person you’re talking to actually is 16. Who is in the wrong then? I don’t understand this. Cause to me it’s so obvious who’s in the wrong, the 16 year old… They lied about their damn age, so how could you be the one in the wrong then? But, apparently you could be the one facing charges then? Right? How… That’s literally so messed up. But it feels like society would view the 16 year old as the victim, or am I wrong??

1c5n54c,"CMV: 90% of the ""protests are meant to be disruptive crowd"" would change their minds if right wingers blocked them in traffic","In response to the recent protests where people blocked roads, highways, bridges, and airports, progressives on reddit have been claiming that blocking traffic is ok because ""PrOtEsTs ArE mEaNt To Be DiSrUpTiVe!""

I've noticed two things about the people who say this.

1. They weren't the ones blocked in traffic.

2. Tbey agree with the protestors' cause.

1c5lpos,"CMV: Saying ""I hate all men"" doesn't make sense","Firstly, to be clear, I understand that I may be in the wrong for this one.

A couple months ago I was hanging out with a bunch of friends (mostly women, two men, not including me) and one suddenly started talking about how she ""hated all men"" and went on about how much she hated all men and how all men should be killed.

While I understand that there are a lot of bad or evil men, and a lot of/all the men she had interacted with might be part of that group, but that can't mean everyone is.

I then said, confused, ""isn't that too much of a generalization?"" and ""there's gotta be, you know, an adjective before 'men' right?""

She didn't answer then, but one of the other girls sent me a message after, saying that the girl was furious about what I said.

Another thing is when I said, at a later time, that ""for example, what if I were to say: Women are bad drivers and get into car crashes all the time, therefore I hate all women"" (not that I believe that, of course)

She then replied ""It's not the same thing"" which also confuses me.

For short: I think it's ok to hate a group of (in this case) men, but grouping everyone with the people that rob, attack or rape people and therefore saying that you hate them doesn't make sense to me.

1ch2b60,CMV: Religious people are excessively accomodated,"I believe that the fact that these accommodations must be recognized often amounts to discrimination against those who are not religious as it implies religious beliefs to be more important than non-religious beliefs. To give an example in parts of Canada and in the UK Sikhs are permitted to ride a motorcycle without a helmet despite it being illegal for anyone else to do the same.  By doing this the government has implied that Sikhism is a more virtuous belief than any other than could involve one choosing not to wear a helmet. Another non Sikh could choose not to wear a helmet simply because they believe that 'looking cooler' on the bike is worth the health risk of not wearing a helmet and by not allowing this the government is implying that the Sikh principles are superior to the principals of maximizing how cool one looks. It is also unfair that taxpayers in the countries will be forced to pay the excessive healthcare bills stemming from the more severe injuries caused by the lack of helmet. A more reasonable solution would be that anyone who chooses not to wear a helmet must pay an extra annual fee to cover the added healthcare costs.

&#x200B;

Another better example would be the fact that Kirpans (knives) are allowed to be carried onto airplanes by Sikhs but not by anyone else in Canada. The religious reason for wearing a Kirpan is in part self defense yet if any other Canadian chooses to carry a knife for self defense reasons it is a violation of the law and they would rightly be denied permission to bring one onto an airplane. Therefore self defence as a principle is honored by the government when it is packaged as part of a religion but not when it is just an important belief held by an individual. The Supreme Court of Canada even went so far as to say this about a kid bringing a kirpan to school

>Religious tolerance is a very important value of Canadian society.  If some students consider it unfair that G may wear his kirpan to school while they are not allowed to have knives in their possession, it is incumbent on the schools to discharge their obligation to instil in their students this value that is at the very foundation of our democracy.

this is a perfect demonstration of the mindset I described. As a non-religious person none of your personal beliefs are required to be taken with the same level of seriousness as a religion's beliefs. I fail to see why this mindset should be held as it is not a fact that religion is some kind of objectively good thing.

1cbrfoe,"CMV: American Jews on the Left are expected to tolerate a level of blatant antisemitism from POC, both personally and more broadly, that would be inconceivable if roles were reversed. ","The blunt truth about it is, American Jews are more concerned with appearing racist then black or Latino Americans are with being antisemitic. Or, if they do think it’s antisemitic they think it takes a backseat to their own struggles against discrimination. Because — most of them — are white. If they think about it at all. It may be no less conscious then something you grow up around hearing. 

This isn’t to say that there isn’t *lots* of work to do in the “white” community still when it comes to race relations *and* antisemitism or that this discrimination cancels out the other, it’s just to say that this is a real problem in the black community. While they were never ever representative of a majority of black Americans, the Nation of Islam was and continues to be an influential part of African America life, especially in cities. 

And if you agree protocols of the elders of Zion is antisemitic book, then you’d agree that an organization that takes its cues on the topic of Jews from such a antisemitic book would likely be, by extension antisemitic. Well early NOI was very much such an organization. And if that organization had deep roots in certain segments of black America it would probably be somewhat worthwhile to consider its effects.  

All this to say, there’s a reason Kanye West — who coincidentally also defended Louis Farrakhan from correct accusations of antisemitism — is still embraced by hip-hop fans and rappers today and if anything seems to be making a comeback of sorts.

Not that me saying this really matters. The people whose opinion this would change don’t read this and they’d only listen to people they respect within their local community. But it does look, to the outside viewer at least, that there’s a lack of reciprocity. 

During the George Floyd protests the arguments for taking to the streets to demand justice and reform society o prevent antiblack racism from killing more Americans or destroying more lives, were rooted in appeals to fundamental appeals to human rights to God. You can’t use that as a cudgel to motivate and shame people into action then turn around and ignore it or say “why they gotta drag black people into it”. Especially when it’s your fellow countrymen.

1c40sa9,"CMV: I struggle to understand why the crisis of masculinity is even a thing, why so many young men listen to the manosphere or influencers in general, etc. I think it is a case of crisis of independence rather than crisis of masculinity.","The current conversation about masculinity (in the US) confuses me very much, and I say this as a man. I grew up in a fairly stable middle class household, parents divorced in my early teens. I joined the US military at 18, served for a few years, and travelled around the country. After my service I started college and am soon entering my senior year. Why am I telling you all this?

I've always considered myself a highly independent person. I've also figured out a lot of things in my life on my own, to include how to rent an apartment, saving for retirement and amassing decent wealth for my age, entering and being successful in school, having a fair number of romantic partners. By many metrics of modern masculinity, I've done well for myself. But this also leaves me confused as to what men are missing from their lives or what they're having a crisis over.

I've never felt the need to have someone validate my masculinity (as it seems that needing someone else for that kinda defeats the point). Truth be told, ""being masculine"" has never really mattered to me much because its always seemed to be buying in to what someone else thinks is a necessary way to live your life--which returns me to my independence point. The rise of influencers and the manosphere has also seemed to be a weird proxy for mentors in many men's lives, which has always seemed to be a case of being far too online for too long in my opinion. I've also never really leaned on many mentors in my life, but that is probably by own bias showing, I'm sure many people get a lot of guidance out of mentor figures.

This altogether is to say that it seems that this crisis of masculinity is at its core a crisis of independence and men unable or unwilling to figure out their lives for themselves. Perhaps it was the military that ultimately gave me this independent foundation, but I think that proves my point--that it is independence and what it gives you than anything that masculinity is doing for people. The point is not that masculinity is failing or unstable, but that men are unable to be independent and take charge of their independence for themselves. Why, I'm not sure exactly--rent is high and wages are low, but women seemingly aren't having as much of a crisis about themselves these days. Many seem to be enjoying and embracing independence instead.

I'm open to the idea that I'm approaching this from the wrong angle though, happy to hear everyone's thoughts.",mandolin6648,722,1406,0.699999988079071,0.5387938575932598,1713120289,/r/changemyview/comments/1c40sa9/cmv_i_struggle_to_understand_why_the_crisis_of/,2024,4
1c91mr3,CMV: The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were 100% justified and Japan was by no means a victim,"I see people decrying Japan as a victim in WW2 all the time, but I'm of the belief that the nukes were completely justified and necessary. I can owe my entire existence to the nukes dropping as I'm Chinese, and my great-grandfather was in a Japanese POW camp when the war ended and would've died if the war continued. The civilian casualties from the nukes pale in comparison to Chinese and Southeast Asian civilian casualties, not to mention the excess Japanese and American deaths that would result from an amphibious landing. Prolonging the war only results in more deaths and more damage. China suffered the most civilian deaths due to crimes against humanity in WW2, and I can see at least 3 or 4 million more were the war to be extended for one year longer.

1c4wp1m,CMV: Dating apps massively contributed to the rise of manosphere/incel ideology,"I've been reading a lot of posts from those subscribed to manosphere stuff here, and I've come to realise that a huge part of why this is happening is the use of dating apps to get dates. The apps basically force everyone to judge a person by a few pictures and a short prompt and give the impression that how you look is all that matters in a relationship, when often people fall in love after knowing and talking to someone. Given that men outnumber women on these apps, it's not surprising that men would find themselves in a highly competitive environment when in reality it's much closer to 50/50. This imbalance left a lot of younger men disappointed at themselves and, worse yet, women for not getting dates. I have this sense that dating apps market themselves as a way to find love, but for a lot of men it's just something that they find upsetting and disappointing. And when someone doesn't have the right support and structure, they would find the manosphere ideology appealing because it feels like their failures have been answered, even though obviously the ideology falls apart at the smallest scrutiny.

I'm sure some people will attribute this to patriarchy, but this manner of demeaning women hasn't been mainstreamed for many many decades, and patriarchy certainly wasn't any weaker back then, so in my view the best explanation is the perception that dating apps is the only way to get dates.",WheatBerryPie,1646,498,0.8899999856948853,0.5273030390685824,1713213042,/r/changemyview/comments/1c4wp1m/cmv_dating_apps_massively_contributed_to_the_rise/,2024,4
1c79zco,"CMV: If you don't singularly blame Hamas for rejecting reasonable ceasefire proposals at this point, you both don't actually want a ceasefire or a release of hostages. And it is damaging the effectiveness of the ceasefire protest movement by not blaming Hamas and instead Israel.","According to all information I can find, the only thing holding up a reasonable ceasefire deal at this point is Hamas. The US has extensively pushed Israel to agree to a proposal that includes releasing 700-900 prisoners, many with life sentences, a return of Palestinians to the north, in exchange for 40 hostages from Hamas and a 6 week ceasefire.

[https://www.axios.com/2024/04/08/us-israel-hamas-hostage-deal-propose-ceasefire](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/08/us-israel-hamas-hostage-deal-propose-ceasefire)

Hamas flatly rejected these proposals and said it won't budge from its main demands of ""a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of the occupation army from the entire Gaza Strip, the return of the displaced to their areas and places of residence, intensification of the entry of relief and aid, and the start of reconstruction""

[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-rejects-israels-ceasefire-response-sticks-main-demands-2024-04-13/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-rejects-israels-ceasefire-response-sticks-main-demands-2024-04-13/)

But those aren't reasonable demands. Reasonable meaning a ceasefire built around things both sides obviously won't agree to. Israel won't agree to basically surrender and leave Gaza without the hostages, and Hamas won't agree to surrender either. 

But Israel isn't making ""Hamas must surrender"" as a main demand if its proposal. Hamas is with respect to Israel.

Which is why the US blames Hamas for not having a ceasefire. 

[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-has-moved-significant-way-hamas-remains-barrier-gaza-hostage-deal-us-says-2024-04-15/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-has-moved-significant-way-hamas-remains-barrier-gaza-hostage-deal-us-says-2024-04-15/)

And the second part of my cmv is that the pro ceasefire protest movement is damaging both the goal of getting a ceasefire deal done and by raising support for Palestinians more generally, but not admitting Hamas as the clear obstacle here. Because why support the protestors when reasonable people on the fence about this conflict can easily see in the news Hamas rejecting ceasefire deals, let alone reporting Hamas won't even give a list of hostages still alive and that they don't have enough hostages to fill the original 40 women, elderly and wounded category?

1bx9zvu,CMV: western young men are becoming more conservative in terms of their views on sexuality,"One thing parallel between my muslim home country and western world is the unpopularity of feminism among men. Indeed, I observed in every country around the world, men are far more likely to hate feminism than women. 

But there is another thing that is increasingly becoming popular among young male western audience, that is emphasis on low body count which seems to be some kind of revival of purity culture. It’s more pronounced online. A lot of posts here on the topic of body count attract hoards of men trying to assert not just how it matters, but how it matters more for women than men. It’s not only on reddit. Take instagram, X, facebook and tiktok as well. 


I’m left rather confused regarding what these men precisely mean by low body count. Back in my home country, the consensus is that a woman should be virgin before marriage. With western male audience, I do find a lot of men saying they want or prefer virgins, but the majority seems to be drawing arbitrary lines. The benchmark is sometimes 3, and other times 5. Some move it even further as well. 


I’m skeptic of claims such as men ideally prefer virgins, since past research has shown decreasing value of chastity among men in the western world.

1btuw7l,"CMV: For Islam to be a viable ethical and moral code, most of the Hadith would need to be outright rejected","To my understanding, in Islam movements that consider the Hadith to be all or mostly rejected are often looked down on in Islamic thought.  Quranist movements are a major example; they may be growing in numbers but they seem to be considered a minority fringe.  As with the Hadiths, some may be necessary in terms of how to pray and what to pray for and the importance of charity.  

That said, huge numbers of the Hadith, when reading them, had to have been written by enemies of the religion looking to destroy its legitimacy or dishonorable and evil warlords of some kind looking to distort the religion for their own needs.

1c0vth7,CMV: Eating a dog is not ethicallly any different than eating a pig,"To the best of my understanding, both are highly intelligent, social, emotional animals. Equally capable of suffering, and pain.

Yet, dog consumption in some parts of the world is very much looked down upon as if it is somehow an unspeakably evil practice. Is there any actual argument that can be made for this differential treatment - apart from just a sentimental attachment to dogs due to their popularity as a pet?

I can extend this argument a bit further too. As far as I am concerned, killing any animal is as bad as another. There are certain obvious exceptions: 

1. Humans don't count in this list of ""animals"". I may not be able to currently make a completely coherent argument for why this distinction is so obviously justifiable (to me), but perhaps that is irrelevant for this CMV. 
2. Animals that actively harm people (mosquitoes, for example) are more justifiably killed. 

Apart from these edge cases, why should the murder/consumption of any animal (pig, chicken, cow, goat, rats)  be viewed as more ok than some others (dogs, cats, etc)?

1bvtplk,CMV: Anyone who sacrifices 40 hours a week of their life deserves to make a living wage,"I will define a living wage as enough money to cover food, housing, internet, phone, electricity, and necessary travel to and from work. Pretty basic, and far from lavish. 

40 hours a week is 24% of one's life. That amount of time should be valued enough by society to grant someone dignity and the ability to cover their basic needs. 

Looking at minimum wage jobs, a worker at McDonald's works harder than many high earning professions, doing a job not many others are willing to do, to provide a service that society would miss if no one was willing to work it. Even low skill jobs, apply stress, exhaustion, and sacrifice of time out of their lives. 

I would also argue that many minimum wage jobs are more important to daily functions of the public, than a lot of cushiony mid to higher level experience jobs, otherwise these jobs wouldn't exist.

People often use the example that a teenager in school doesn't need to make a living wage, however if they are working full time, perhaps they do. Regardless, their effort and the time committed to working said job should warrant the same pay, if they put in the same hours.

1bu11sl,CMV: I believe society let female harasser and predators get away with things lightly just because people find it hard attributing such behavior to women,"
I work as a male stripper , and I encounter a lot of evil, manipulative and predatory women in my line of work. They are more common in the rich and “high profile” parties/clients . 

And I find it odd how no one talks about it. And how it’s low key rewarded by society.


When I first started modeling and dancing, I was good at my job where I ended up being invited to more high profile parties to just perform. I was in my early 20s. Perform to rich , famous people sometimes even.

And my first encounter with sexual harassment was in one of these parties by one of these rich/popular women.

I froze and let it happen. 

But then when I told my manager and colleagues , I was always told to “man up” or “you should feel lucky” or “many guys would pay to be in that position” and so on.

I guess it didn’t help that these clients held a lot of power in terms of money and influence that the managers would side with them and just train us to let it happen and enjoy and shut up about it . 

Being a nobody who was young , being paid good and peer pressured into it being a good thing . You get used to it. 

Because to society , when a woman is the predator , it’s seen as hot.

And it’s not even about me being a man , it happens to female dancers as well , and the response is very different when its a woman taking advantage of her power compared to men. 


I just find it odd . Maybe I’m wrong but I just felt like sharing my point of view

1cf21rz,CMV: It is impossible to separate art from artist if the artist is still alive to profit from their works,"This one's been stewing in the back of my mind for a long time now, but my friends were suddenly discussing J. K. Rowling for some reason, and I got reminded of the whole Hogwarts Legacy controversy. Now, while I want to support separating art from artists as a matter of principle, logically, I cannot. No matter how I spin it, I cannot see how giving money to a person in exchange for their products is not supporting that person and the things they support by extension. As an obvious example, if you bought a music album from a Mexican drug cartel, you are giving that cartel money and supporting them in the same way an addict buying their drugs would be supporting them.",Dry_Ninja_3360,698,686,0.6899999976158142,0.34655363175739184,1714295127,/r/changemyview/comments/1cf21rz/cmv_it_is_impossible_to_separate_art_from_artist/,2024,4
1c8rxy4,CMV: Polyamory is just a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal.,"Three years ago, my ex partner unilaterally demanded we open our marriage during a trip with friends where I couldn't escape or even have a healthy conversation about it, then threatened to leave if I didn't comply when we came home.   
  
I begged and pleaded, but eventually relented. Then, after a few months I began to explore the literature and rules of polyamory in online support groups and became curious about finding my own relationships outside of our marriage (I realised later that this was mostly to escape the abuse I was still putting up with at home, which had persisted for for years).   
  
When I told my partner that I was also curious to find other people, she exploded in a terrifying rage that I am still struggling to understand. She accused me of just taking advantage of her 'coming out polyamorous first' in our marriage, insisted that I couldn't possibly be polyamorous because I am autistic, and finally demanded I 'prove' to her (somehow) that I ever felt love for another person other than her. 

When I couldn't come up with an example other than the one other crush I had before we began officially dating six years prior, she again threatened to leave, screaming at me for being a misogynist, and all I could do was beg for forgiveness and cry myself to sleep. 

She apologised days later, but halfheartedly and still accused me of being both a misogynist and narcissist who needed therapy and we scheduled couple's therapy together with a poly-friendly therapist. 

Two months later--and four days before our appointment--she cheated on me. 

She came home and confessed while begging for forgiveness in another whirlwind of pain, and again I gave her a pass as I was now terrified of being abandoned--only for her to buy a one-way ticket to Portland the next morning. 

I never saw her again. 

She filed for divorce 1,000 miles away, leaving me with our two cats and a whole heap of debt. I still went to our therapist appointment somehow, but alone. She was incredible. She helped me understand the full extent of the abuse I had been suffering for years and convinced me that polyamory and narcissism often intersect--but don't necessarily have to. 

But it still didn't help, and I checked myself into an emergency outpatient facility after a suicide attempt.

Things stabilised, but I left the country and am now struggling with severe mental illness and barely making ends meet while having to deal with the constant aching pain of having lost my best friend to what still feels like a relationship system defined by 'what you can get out of life'--not on forming a unique, stable, honest, and committed partnership. 

Please help me change my view.

I'm left grappling with deep emotional scars, questioning whether polyamory is inherently flawed or if my experience was an outlier.

I acknowledge that my ex-partner's behaviour was manipulative and abusive, but I'm struggling to reconcile how polyamory could be anything other than a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal. However, I'm open to reconsidering my perspective, as I don't want to let one traumatic experience colour my understanding of an entire relationship dynamic.

I'm seeking insights from the community to challenge my current view. Can anyone provide examples or arguments that showcase healthy and fulfilling polyamorous relationships? How can I separate my ex-partner's toxic behaviour from the broader concept of polyamory? I want to believe that love and honesty can coexist within non-monogamous relationships, but I need help reconciling my pain and trauma.",Ronald-Obvious,1002,357,0.7900000214576721,0.334936730563592,1713625010,/r/changemyview/comments/1c8rxy4/cmv_polyamory_is_just_a_breeding_ground_for/,2024,4
1c3b96y,CMV: San Francisco's proposal allowing shoppers to sue grocery stores if the grocery stores close due to high crime is deeply backwards and dangerous,"Apparently, high crime is pushing businesses in San Francisco to close and instead of trying to address the crime issue, San Francisco lawmakers are trying to pass legislation that would allow shoppers to sue grocers who inconvenience them by closing. Essentially holding them hostage. 

I understand groceries are a necessity (and that should be sufficient motivation for lawmakers to address the issues with crime instead of hand waving people's complaints aside.) but it's also completely understandable that grocers don't want to stay in high crime areas and they can't be forced to. It is San Francisco Lawmakers' responsibility to maintain communities that businesses will want to be a part of and if they are unable to do so then I think that should be grounds for removal. 

I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts though. This seems absolutely bonkers to me.

1byxjde,CMV: Israel is showing extreme callousness towards civilian casualties in their war in Gaza,"5 days ago, [+972 Mag](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/) published an article that focuses on Lavendar AI technology and the IDF approach to civilian casualties. A few other outlets have already reported on this story, so it is likely that the sources have been corroborated and +972 Mag is generally seen as [reliable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/972-magazine/). While most of the focus of the +972 Mag's article is on the AI, there are a few other things that really caught my attention:

>it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians; in the past, the military did not authorize any “collateral damage” during assassinations of low-ranking militants. 

This ratio of 15 to 20 civilians is _absurdly_ high for a low-ranking militant. According to [this article](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/assessing-israel-s-approach-to-proportionality-in-the-conduct-of-hostilities-in-gaza) on proportionality analysis, the US Army generally accepts _ZERO_ for low-ranking militant, anything in the realm of 14 to 15 requires approval from the Secretary of Defense, and for Osama bin Laden the figure is 30. I don't understand how the IDF is permitting its commanders to approve a strike themselves if it kills up to 20 civilians per low-ranking militant.

>they would personally devote only about “20 seconds” to each target before authorizing a bombing — just to make sure the Lavender-marked target is male. This was despite knowing that the system makes what are regarded as “errors” in approximately 10 percent of cases, and is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose connection to militant groups, or no connection at all.

I'm not sure about you, but 10% is a crazy high error rate, because this is additive to the error rate that humans make. This is not some sort of error rate for a sorting machine, this is an error rate of killing people with weaponry. Using this and the information provided above, there's _at least_ a 10% chance that up to 20 civilians will die because of a Lavender error. 

>the commander laments: “We [humans] cannot process so much information. It doesn’t matter how many people you have tasked to produce targets during the war — you still cannot produce enough targets per day.”

This is incredibly dystopian. It feels like the commanders have a target number to hit every day, and because humans aren't capable to hitting that target by ourselves, an AI tool is used to speed up that process, a tool that has very little oversight.

>the Lavender machine sometimes mistakenly flagged individuals who had communication patterns similar to known Hamas or PIJ operatives — including police and civil defense workers, militants’ relatives, residents who happened to have a name and nickname identical to that of an operative, and Gazans who used a device that once belonged to a Hamas operative. 

This is not just a problem that runs deep in Lavender, it runs deep in their training set as well, which means the IDF consistently flag non-Hamas civilians as Hamas members. It puts the number of ""Hamas militant killed"" into question because that figure reported by the IDF must've included a lot of false positives like militants' relatives, nurses, etc.

>We were constantly being pressured: ‘Bring us more targets.’ They really shouted at us. We finished [killing] our targets very quickly.”

This speaks to a more top-down approach and systemic problem to killing Hamas militants. Because of the pressure from higher ups to rake up Hamas death toll, the lower level officials feel pressured to kill without proper oversight or check on intelligence. It feels like someone clocking into work, being demanded to hit some x targets a day, and clock out. There seems to be little consideration for what is the actual threat the targets pose to Israel or IDF. 

>“In the bombing of the commander of the Shuja’iya Battalion, we knew that we would kill over 100 civilians,” 

It's insane to me that a target like Osama bin Laden has an acceptable civilian death ratio of 30, but a commander in Gaza has a ratio of 100. I don't know, this seems very callous to me.


I can go on and on and I can bring up other incidents too like the WCK drone strike, but the point I'm making here is even if the IDF doesn't have a policy to target civilians, they sure as hell ignore civilian casualties in their policy-making. I don't know how this does not amount to a systemic enabling of war crimes. Also, the IDF response (which we have no reason to believe is true) does not deny the claims made by the sources I quoted. They denied some of the interpretations/extrapolations by others, and some of the minor details, but not the central claim of the article or the quotes I put above.",WheatBerryPie,394,856,0.6600000262260437,0.3170001549087267,1712581987,/r/changemyview/comments/1byxjde/cmv_israel_is_showing_extreme_callousness_towards/,2024,4
1byyvoa,CMV: The abortion debate should not be framed as men vs. women,"I’m not here to argue about whether or not abortion should be legal. However for reference I am pro-choice and a man.

I fully acknowledge that women are more affected by abortion restrictions than men. That being said, as a man I’m don’t benefit from stronger abortion laws at ALL. If I unintentionally get a girl pregnant that I’m not in a relationship with, I have to pay child support for the next 18 years. Yes it’s much harder on the woman since she has to carry the child and breast feed, but my life would get worse as well. 

Polls in the United States would also show that women aren’t that much more likely to be pro choice either. 55% of women identify as pro choice vs. 48% of men. 

Really the debate should be framed as religious vs. non-religious since religious people feel that abortion is evil and killing an innocent life, while non-religious people don’t see it as a life and don’ think the government should interfere what someone does with their body.

Not so for Muslim women.

There’s no reason a Muslim woman and a Christian man, who worked it out with each other prior to marriage, acknowledged that the children they’d have will be taught the values and tenets of Islam. That way the faith is preserved in the family if that’s so important to her.

When you look at the grand scheme of things, the primary value of being a good and honest person is to do your part in making society function properly. Unfortunately, society is *not* functioning properly, and likely won't no matter how good you try to be, because too many people are evil and selfish, and as a result nothing's working the way it should. Everyone is absolutely suffering now in some way or another except for those who live in a comfort that came from taking advantage of someone else.

1c5mgu1,CMV: Everyone would be better off if women were the ones who were expected to make the first move.,"Attention from the opposite gender is like water. Men are desperately thirsty for it, while women are drowning in it.   
Most women don't like being approached randomly in public or being confessed to, while I don't know a single man who wouldn't appreciate being approached. The ""men remember compliments for years"" things is true for a reason. 

On top of that, there is also the aspect of safety, and the current societal expectation of men approaching women has resulted in women being seriously hurt or even killed due to rejecting a man. Women basically have to fear for their safety every time a man approaches them. Again, if women were the ones to approach, this wouldn't be an issue. 

If women were expected to approach, they could go out and not worry about guys hitting on her, and men can finally take a break from always having to be the initiator. Everyone wins.

1btq872,CMV: Suicide should be a human right. ,"To put it simply: you do not get to choose to be born. If, one day, you wish to see yourself out, that should be your basic, fundamental human right.

1cdcbrh,CMV: I believe that forced Conscription is akin to slavery and never justified. A society unwilling or unable too generate enough volunteers for its armed forces is not worth defending.,"Conscription is one of the worst infringements on personal life and liberty: First, young people (usually only men, which is a great injustice) are forced to perform forced labor for their government with very little compensation.

People who refuse to perform that forced labor usually are imprisoned for multiple months (if alternative service is available that does not change anything because it is still forced labor and refusing alternative service too usually will mean imprisonment too).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Secondly, it is even worse if that country is at war: Then the infringement upon the rights of the young people is even greater, because now thy are in massive danger to their life. It is also worth noting that conscripts in almost all circumstances very quickly turn into chess figures that is at the government's disposal for their own politics.

The best instances for this are: The Vietnam War (North Vietnam did not attack the U.S. and did not pose a threat - in fact, after they won in 1975 they did not retaliate).

Even Israel's Gaza War, while in principle justified, could be considered to be prolonged by Netanyahu for ulterior motives.

Similarly, the Ukraine-Russia War, while Ukraine is defending itself, their government refuses to even consider accepting giving any territory to Russia, preferring to sacrifice hundreds of thousands young men on the battlefield. The same applies to Russia, which is also willing to send their people into battle as cannon fodder.

Both countries have instituted measures to ban men from leaving the country. Ukraine deployed tens of thousands of soldiers to their borders with Nato countries with orders to shoot anyone trying to leave the country. Hundreds of men have perished trying to escape Ukraine.

This reminds me very sadly of the criminal activities by communist East Germany, which also shot people at the border who tried to escape the country.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In my opinion, these massive infringement upon the rights of individuals bears no justification whatsoever. While I do see the need to ensure national defense, I do not think that if the government, the society as a whole, is not able or willing to institute the necessary measures relying solely on volunteers, then this country and its people are to blame for themselves if they get conquered - because apparently, there were not enough people voluntarily defending it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I would also stress that in modern military technology, there is no real need of conscription because, for example, a strong air force of hundreds of modern fighter jets, as well as drones, plus an army with many tanks, artillery pieces, rocket artillery and similar technology, will beat a large army of men armed with rifles.

The farthest I would be willing to compromise on would be to formally have conscription (for all genders, of course), but if one refuses they will only face a fine, for example $ 1,000, and no other consequences at all. This way, some people who would not join the army on their own iniative, but are not actually opposed to it, would enlist because they formally have that duty. On the other hand, anyone really opposed to conscription would not be held to forced labor nor harshly punished, but basically giving a small contribution to national defense with their money.",dwujd,312,597,0.6200000047683716,0.23009134601646444,1714105491,/r/changemyview/comments/1cdcbrh/cmv_i_believe_that_forced_conscription_is_akin_to/,2024,4

1c8u5zh,CMV: The West could easily equip Ukraine to achieve a full victory reclaiming pre-2014 borders at very little cost. ,"We just need to send actually meaningful numbers of weapons and vehicles. 

If it were up to me the West would send as soon as humanly possible: 

* 90% of our currently existing artillery ammunition (that Ukraine can use), including rockets for HIMARS and ATACMS.

* Plentiful supplies of small arms, heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, shoulder mounted anti tank/anti air missile launchers, mortars, artillery batteries, and ammunition for all of those. 

* A basic given that would be pretty cheap compared to other things is ensuring all Ukrainian infantrymen have top tier western equipment. 

Videos show that in real life some Ukrainian infantrymen still use AK-47s. In America we have 120 civilian owned firearms per 100 people. We can definitely gift each one of them an AR-15 platform rifle with an ACOG scope, suppressor, and underbarrel grip. 500,000 of those $3,000 rifles are only worth $1.5 billion. How has this not already happened? 

Standard American helmets, visors, ceramic plate vests, night vision goggles, boots, etc. Winter gear set as well. Just the videos coming out of all Ukrainian soldiers being decked out like this would boost Ukrainian/western morale and degrade Russian morale once it’s undeniable. 

* 2,000 infantry fighting vehicles. 

A brand new American M2A4 Bradley Fighting Vehicle costs $4.35 million. 2,000 of them is only $8.7 billion. What a tiny cost for such a massive boost. This alone would likely guarantee Ukraine’s victory. That’s not even 4 days of the US military budget. In real life the U.S. has only given 190 Bradleys. 

* 1,000 American/European main battle tanks. 

Why so many tanks? They’ll have lots of functional tanks in reserve so that tanks can be used aggressively. They’ll grow into the large number of tanks as they build more refueling/repair infrastructure and get more tank ammo and as more trained Ukrainian crews come back from America/Europe. The many tanks that survive the war will bolster Ukraine’s post-war defense. With this quantity of hardware they just can’t lose. 

1,000 main battle tanks is nothing for us in the West but everything for Ukraine. 10,300 M1 Abrams tanks and 3,600 Leopard 2 tanks have been built. In real life the US only given 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine and Germany has only given 14 Leopard 2 tanks. What a joke. We’re sitting on massive stockpiles and giving Ukraine next to nothing. 

* 500 F-16 jets and 100 F-22 jets. 

* A plentiful amount of drones. 

* However many basic vehicles like jeeps or supply trucks they need. 

* 200 [M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicles]. 

239 have been built and in 2021 we sold 29 of them to Australia. Australia does not need these giant 40 feet (12 meter) long mine-clearing vehicles. Send them all to Ukraine. Ukraine has very few of them.
 
* All the air defense they need.

But with a focus on using cheaper anti-drone anti air systems weapons against cheap drones and using Patriots on more expensive targets.

Here’s what would happen next: 

* There would be an enormous number of artillery, mortar, cruise missile, HIMARS, and ATACMS strikes against Russian targets both in Ukraine and in Russia. 

* Tens of thousands of Ukrainians would be flown to America/Europe for training on vehicles and in vehicle repair. 

* In the meantime there would be a program for western F-16 and F-22 veterans to fly in Ukraine immediately for $100,000/year tax free. This program would be funded by western governments in direct proportion to their share of total nominal GDP. So right now the jets would be immediately transferred to Ukrainian ownership and Ukrainian airbases. American pilots can leave service to join the mercenary company. All 600 jets would get staffed and would remain so until the Ukrainians are doing training. 

* With air superiority and a proper number of mine-clearing vehicles, Ukrainians would retake occupied territory with massive numbers of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. The positions they attack would be weakened by the massive conventional artillery and rocket artillery barrages sent by Ukraine after receiving 90% of currently existing western artillery ammunition. 

* The West is already rapidly ramping up ammunition for both conventional artillery and rocket artillery systems. 

* Ukraine gets the missiles/drones it needs to destroy the Crimean bridge, and cuts off the Crimean land bridge through a counteroffensive. 

* Crimea is besieged and falls. Massive blow to morale. 

* Ukraine continues its counteroffensive and starts recapturing major symbolic cities like Bakhmut, Mariupol, and Donetsk. 

* Ukraine secures pre-2014 borders and uses their massive numbers of tanks/IFVs to rest assured in their security. 

* Ukraine continues expanding their domestic military industrial base and has mandatory military service like Israel and South Korea. 

* Ukraine joins the EU and NATO. European and American troops stationed in Ukraine. Ukraine rapidly develops economically, unlike Russia and Belarus. 

* Ukraine and the West live happily ever after and pursue their destinies without war with Russia.

1c6swqd,CMV: The Tipping Culture In The US Has Gotten Ridiculous ,"I am going to get a lot of hate for this one but I’m already prepared lol. 

Tipping Culture in the US specifically has gotten way out of hand I mean it’s ridiculous at this point. I am not some stingy individual and I have no problem with giving people tips for their service and time. But nowadays there seems to be a weird vibe that you have to always tip, and if you don’t you are a scumbag or something. 

I grew up learning and understanding the value of tipping for GOOD service, not shitty service. If I go to a car wash and after my car still has visible stains and missed spots, I should not be forced to provide a tip for that service. 

And I know what you are thinking right now no one is forcing me to give anyone a tip. The issue is looks of shame and disgust that people in the service industry will give you, as well as the overall peer pressure of how others perceie you. 

And let’s not get started about when you give someone a tip and they feel like it is too small of an amount. A recent example is I gave my DoorDash driver a $10 tip for a $15 order, and he told me that it was disrespectful because it was not enough to cover his gas for driving to me. 

It’s little instances like this that make me feel the service industry in America have literally lost their minds when it comes to this whole tipping thing. 

Again I am not a stingy person, I just do not believe that I always have to leave a tip, especially when it comes to bad service. ",dannyrules101,511,369,0.8100000023841858,0.21921527450177292,1713409059,/r/changemyview/comments/1c6swqd/cmv_the_tipping_culture_in_the_us_has_gotten/,2024,4

But from my mind, all of the reasons I support Palestine are right wing in nature and all the arguments for israel would be left wing in nature.

1cadgf3,CMV: There has never been a good representation of Arab people in American media ,"I am Lebanese-Canadian and I struggled so much as a kid never seeing my Arab culture represented correctly or even just seeing Arab people always play the villains or terrorists in movies and tv shows. Still to this day I think any Arab character I’ve ever seen in popular media has been incredibly inaccurate or racist.  I think people veiw the Arab countries as too much of a controversial subject to put into media as a main character hero or protagonist. Anytime Americans see depictions of Arab culture their brain Immidiatly associates it with war, terrorism, and Islamophobia. No positive depictions of Arab people in popular media is only continuing the anti Arab narrative. When I was in middle school I had people classmates asking me and my siblings if we were a part of ISIS. Positive Arab representation would help squash this racism so fast I feel. I want to have my opinion changed because I would love to see some people say examples of accurate Arab representation that I’ve never seen before. But I have never seen any therefore it’s my opinion. 

Some caviats: 

1. I am specifically talking about popular western media so projects made by the USA/canada/europe not films that were made in Arab countries
 
2. I am not saying I hate the original Alladin but as much as I loved it as a kid it is incredibly flawed and their “representation” is just racist stereotypes. I have a lot of beef with the alladin live action remake because they put no effort into making it actually representative of Arab countries and cultures and characters so I just count that movie as a tasteless cash grab with no actual attempt to do any proper representation.

3. Indian/East Asian films and shows don’t count. I am specifically talking about Arab countries like Lebanon, Iran, Egypt, Morocco for example. I want to give Ms. Marvel kudos for being really good Muslim and Pakistani representation but I can’t count it in this because I’m talking about Arab in particular. 


The closest thing I’ve seen of popular proper Arab representation is Moon Knight. The main charachter isn’t Arab just the setting so I don’t count it. But the Arab music is fire so it gets kudos from me. The work they did to make the setting accurate was enough to make me happy. I want my opinion to be changed because I would LOVEE to see some people put from good Arab representation media in the comments and prove me wrong. In order for it to count, the main character, protagonist, or hero has to be an accurately represented Arab character, preferably in an Arab country or setting. Side characters can also MAYBE change my opinion depending how relevant they are to the media. The whole point is it’s proper representation not just a token Arab character that has zero depth.

1cc3sfq,"CMV: Religions should not be considered ""sacred"" and should be open to ridicule and mockery","Typically it is socially not acceptable to make fun of someone's religion and their religious beliefs. 

Yet all religions are is really a collection of extraordinary (often totally outlandish) claims about the nature of reality, but without the need to back those claims up by scientific evidence. 

So a guy or a group of people make some pretty outlandish claims without presenting any real evidence, typically this involves a higher being (or higher beings), they gather a large following, their followers write down their claims and stories, pass them on throughout the generations .... and an organization is born around those claims and stories .... which we call religion. 

And I'm not even trying to make a case for atheism here. If someone were to simply say "" I think there is likely a higher being for reasons XYZ..."" that's one thing. But religions make some very specific and outlandish claims about who they believe that higher being to be and claim to have direct messages from said higher being, but don't see the need to provide any real evidence. 

Holy books contain stories about how the higher being told its favorite people to destroy cities and even kill babies and mothers, how the higher being wants people to be put to death for working on Saturdays, how the higher being watches everyone but does not like it when gay men have consensual s3x, and the higher being wants women to be obedient. There's special messangers, called prophets who are in direct contact with the higher being, and it has happened some of special those messengers caught a ride on winged horse to heaven. And the higher being likes to really show off sometimes, so it/he/she does things like turn water into wine or help people walk on water. Religions regularly claim totally outlandish things that completely go against everything we know about physics and how reality works. 

I'm not saying one should deliberately pick fights with religious people. But somehow it's the societal standard that when the topic of religion comes up you should be respectful towards someone's beliefs and not point out how ridiculous their beliefs may be.

So if someone told you they're a follower of religion XYZ and told you what they believe in, it would be considered very rude to call them out and tell them you think that their religion is nonsense or immoral. Yet we don't apply the same standards when it comes to other worldviews. For example if I met someone in a pub and they told me they're an anarcho-capitalist, most people wouldn't consider it extremly rude and totally unacceptable if I went like ""no offence but I think anarcho-capitalism is stupid, tell me why you would support that"". Yet if I said the same about Christianity or Islam it would be considered incredibly rude by most people. 

Change my view. Why should it be less socially acceptable to mock and ridicule religion than it is to mock and ridicule other worldviews (e.g. communism, socialism, capitalism etc.)?

The view is simple. The police have a specific job and that job has nothing to do with serving the average person. Police work for the government and enforce the government’s laws and prioritize what the government wants them to prioritize. This mostly ends up meaning they protect rich people’s property and persons from poor people because the government primarily serves the interests of rich people.

The average person simply is not a priority for the government/police until they break a law. It has been ruled by the Supreme Court that the police have no obligation to protect you and it is standard procedure for police to lie to you if they think it’ll get them what they want.

To get ahead of the straw man arguments, no I am not saying the average person doesn’t benefit from the police in any way. I’m not saying the police are necessarily out to get you. I’m not saying your cop brother is an untrustworthy person.

1c7fp7w,CMV: Many of the Gulf States that are allied with the United States are as morally reprehensible as Iran,"American and British politicians love to paint Iran as a great evil of the Middle East, as if it's the only bad actor in town, but I think that a lot of the Gulf States like Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar are just as evil as Iran is. Just like Iran, these countries are authoritarian regimes that heavily restrict the freedom of their people. 

Saudi Arabia is a theocratic monarchy, and it's dominant from of Islamic interpretation, Wahhabism, is notably conservative amongst all Islamic interpretations. Women are only allowed to drive in 2017, and today women are still under the male guardianship system despite improvements over the years. In the Yemen Civil War, Saudi Arabia has been criticised for indiscriminate bombings and intentionally worsening the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. When it comes to suppressing dissent, they famously assassinated Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul because he was a known dissident of Saudi Arabia.

Qatar is also a monarchy and it's known for abusing it's foreign workforce and can be constitute modern slavery. The relationship between them and their employers opens them to be victims of human trafficking and forced labour. If we want to criticise the Iran-backed Houthis for modern slavery, let's not forget our goverments-backed Qatar for the same crime. 

You may then point out that at least they don't fund proxies. Well, they do! Saudi funds their proxies in Yemen, previously in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain and Lebanon to contain Iranian influence in the region. Today the UAE is the biggest supporter of RSF, a genocidal militant force in Sudan that is responsible for numerous massacres. 

The point here is American and British governments only call Iran a ""destabilising force"" or an adversary because of their refusal to align with the West, not because of their immoral or evil actions in the Middle East, because if that's the case we won't be aligning ourselves with most of the Gulf States.",WheatBerryPie,438,385,0.7699999809265137,0.20569121627413933,1713476967,/r/changemyview/comments/1c7fp7w/cmv_many_of_the_gulf_states_that_are_allied_with/,2024,4
1c7ibn3,CMV: Housing should not be an investment ,"I don’t believe that it’s good that housing is viewed as an investment. The problems I see from this are that: 

1 - this makes housing artificially more expensive than it should be and leads to homelessness and people spending too much money on rent/mortgage.

2 - housing as investment provides an incentive for home owners to be nimby’s. A class of people is created that now oppose the construction of new housing because this makes their homes less valuable.

3 - it’s a poor place to store wealth. Having wealth tied up in housing isn’t economically productive. Would it be better for the economy if your house cost $50k or 500k? If it was only 50k, you could diversify your wealth. You could buy bonds to help fund companies or the government. You could buy stocks. You could just spend it and put it right into the economy. 

I’m not saying that all housing should cost the same. A 4,000 sq foot apartment in NYC is always going to cost way more than a 700 sq foot apartment in Oklahoma City. But I don’t believe the price of housing (rents or home prices) should be expected to rise faster than inflation. 

How would it be achievable? Simple - build more housing. Tons of it. And most of it should be non-profit housing. This is housing - ideally apartment buildings - that is deed restricted to not increase rent above costs of the building. 

This would be a huge net benefit for society. ",eriksen2398,268,501,0.7400000095367432,0.19458516295245004,1713483672,/r/changemyview/comments/1c7ibn3/cmv_housing_should_not_be_an_investment/,2024,4

1bvkyf3,CMV: Smoking (anything) should be banned in public in most cases,"In most European countries and many states in the US, smoking is already banned indoors in most places, restaurants, bars, etc. and even parks in some cases. In my personal experience, despite people saying they wouldn't, these bans have generally worked very well and I think it's quite rare for someone to actually smoke in of these places and get a fine.

Some definitions/clarifications

Smoking - anything, tobacco, marijuana, whatever. Potentially vaping though not sure about that

Public - to keep it simple, public would include everywhere except someone's own house, private property (i.e. car, garden, whatever someone owns). There would be some exceptions like forests or open areas where one can reasonably expect not to meet someone else. It would however include private businesses though, as is the case now with restaurants, bars, clubs in most places I've described. I'd also be open to an exception anywhere if it's very clear that there won't be anyone around you (like 4am in the morning on a street in the suburb).

A lot of times people in CMV tend to focus on very specific things. For example here someone might say ""but how do you define open areas?"" What I'd say is that I'm open to loosening my definition and what I'm only debating here is the basic idea that wherever you have the opportunity to meet a foreign person who doesn't want to/consent to inhaling what you're smoking, you shouldn't be allowed to do so.

Now to get to the reason. I'm not expressing a view on what people want to do in their own homes or with other people who don't mind inhaling smoke. I don't think a ban would be effective or desirable there as clearly it can't be enforced. My idea is that when I walk on a public street, I don't want to inhale second hand tobacco or marijuana, so why should someone be able to ""pollute"" the street like that, by doing something that arguably is bad for them anyway (tobacco at least). Obviously the indoor bans were also controversial and it was easier to justify because there's no open air but even in open air, if there's people smoking on the street it does leave a stench and there's clearly a reason why some parks ban smoking.

1cdrc81,"CMV: we should ban entirely the use of ""your honor"" in reference to judges of any kind in a courtroom","Disclaimer: I'm American and have no idea what customs are in courtrooms elsewhere. 

At the founding of the US, there was some question of what to call the executive, George Washington. 

Some had floated ""your highness"" or ""your grace."" Washington rejected these titles, settling simply on ""Mr. President,"" which at the time had very minimal prestige associated with it (for example, a head of a book club). Happily, this trend has continued. Mr. President has stuck.

How on earth do we call even traffic court judges ""your Honor"", including in second person (""your honor mentioned earlier ________"" instead of ""you mentioned earlier"")? I'm watching the immunity trial and it seems absurd.

Not only is it an inversion of title and authority, it seems like blatant sucking up to someone who will presumably have a lot of power over your life, or your case. 

We don't call bosses your honor, we don't call doctors that save lives your honor, we use the term *only* for people who could either save or ruin our lives, or at a minimum give us slack on parking tickets.

I would propose that a law be passed to ban the term in all courts, federal and state, and henceforth judges should be addressed as ""Judge _______"". 

Copied from another answer:

Imagine a boss insisted all his employees to refer to him as “His Majesty,” or “Your Holiness,"" and not abiding by this was fireable. Do you genuinely believe that this wouldn't eventually make its way to a hostile work environment or wrongful termination lawsuit?",grandoctopus64,287,411,0.6299999952316284,0.17587943288366353,1714152676,/r/changemyview/comments/1cdrc81/cmv_we_should_ban_entirely_the_use_of_your_honor/,2024,4
