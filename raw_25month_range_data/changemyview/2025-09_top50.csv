1nkimjq,CMV: Republicans are no longer conservative--they're *fascist*,"We shouldn't be calling American right-wingers conservatives anymore. They've crossed over into fascism at this point.

*Principles of conservatism that MAGA violates*:
- Limited, small government 
(MAGA supports the Trump administration's overuse of executive powers and the military, welcoming expansion of the government into private life)
- Freedom of speech
(MAGA supporters have welcomed Trump's condemnation and attacks against the speech of journalists, media companies, and public figures that have opposing viewpoints)
- Democratic elections
(January 6th was an attempt to prevent the results of a verifiably democratic election from seating the next administration)
- The Constitution
(Trump and his supporters have not only encroached upon the 1st amendment, but outwardly voiced that taking unconstitutional action is justified)
- Law, order, and decency
(MAGA supporters tolerate or support January 6th (for ex., the Trump pardons), minimize right-wing violence, and ignore the crimes and likely crimes of Trump, such as suspected sex crimes--despite claiming Christian values as a foundational value to their cause)


The violations of these conservative principles points toward fascist ideology, where government overreach, suppression of opposition, and anti-democratic values take form. No, we're not living under an early 1940s Nazi regime at this time, but I believe ""conservatives"" should no longer be able to brand that label, as they have beliefs more aligned with fascism. 

This isn't meant to be a heated or angry post. I'm just genuinely convinced of this line of argumentation, though I'm willing to have my view changed!",Usual_Set4665,9986,3119,0.7799999713897705,1.0,1758225542,/r/changemyview/comments/1nkimjq/cmv_republicans_are_no_longer_conservativetheyre/,2025,9
1nun0zk,"CMV: The words “Nazi” “racist” and “fascist” HAVE had their meaning and impact decreased, not because of misattribution, but because Nazis, racists, and fascists are actually so common these days (especially in America) that it isn’t a gut punch or all that crazy to call someone that.","I see conservatives always going “The left calls everyone racist! The left calls everyone fascist! The word has lost its meaning!”

Well maybe the word has lost its meaning because there are so many legitimate racists and fascists in our society that just don’t self identify with those labels despite pursuing similar or exact goals and beliefs. 

If you are “anti antifa” that means you are “anti anti fascist” which makes you a fascist. This isn’t that hard. If you say are flying the flag of an illegitimate nation that committed treason for the purpose of owning black people as property almost 200 years ago, then you are racist, even if you want to deny it to yourself.

1nsyup5,CMV: America will never be able to recover from this even after Trump leaves office.,"First of all, let's have no illusion about it: Trump will not leave office willingly in 2028. He did not in 2020 and he will not in 2028. He has openly said that ""There will be no more elections"" after he is elected; he has repeatedly said that he will be ""a dictator from day one""; he has built a hundred million dollar ballroom in the white house (you don't do that if you plan on not being there to use it in four years); he has turned the entire white house into a gold-plaquered palace like a tinpot middle-eastern dictator's seraglio; he has repeatedly said that American elections are rigged and that he will ""unrig"" it, which means he will likely either rig it or suspend it if he can, so there will be serious issues with the upcoming election in 2026. 

All indications point to that he will, if he can, rule as the first dictator of America for life. 

But hypothetically, let's say miraculously America is able to withstand this onslaught against its own democracy from within, and after 2028, we elect a new president, perhaps Gavin Newsom, and we were to hold a Nuremberg trial against the entire Trump administration, put Trump and his entire crime family in jail; indict, convict, and jail all associates of Donald Trump, all the people who enabled the power grab for Donald Trump, raze all the Trump towers to the ground, like what allied armies did to the defeated Nazi Germany, completely reverse course on all authoritarian policies that Trump has enacted, re-establish political guard rails, introduce new legislation to prevent the rise of another Trump for the next 250 years. 

Even then, in this most optimistic outcome, which is unlikely to be honest, I don't think it's possible that the rest of the world will ever trust America again. Think of Germany. Germany was the center of the world prior to World War II. Germany dominated the world in terms of science, technology, arts, philosophy, music, literature. Nazi Germany completely destroyed this once great civilization and to this day, nearly 80 years afterward, Germany has never been able to recover to reclaim its prestigious position in the world it once held, and to this day, Germans live in shame over what happened 80 years ago.

What is happening to America under the Trump administration is very similar. For over 80 years, America has prized itself as the champion of democracy, freedom, equality, rule of law; fighting against tyranny, slavery, oppression around the world; and yet America, under the current Trump administration, is turning its back on all those values. And America is now attacking its own most staunchest allies, from Canada, to Great Britain, to Japan and South Korea. It took America over 80 years to build this trust internationally, and maintaining that trust has been costly and laborious. Once broken, it can never be recovered.

There is an American expression: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me, or, as American president George Bush so eloquently put it, ""shame ... shame ... shame on  ... fool me you can't get fooled again."" The rest of the world was fooled for the first time by the election of Trump in 2016. Now, again, in 2020. And this time, it has been much worse. The rest of the world will forever remember America as the country that is capable of electing a dictator-wannabe, not once, but twice. 

The rest of the world will think twice, even if America were to reverse course, before trusting ever America again. And that trust is not just as in terms of political and military alliances, but also entails the trust in the American bond, the U.S. treasury. the dollar as the reserve currency of the world, the global presence of American military, which were allegedly to protect the free world from authoritarianism, which America itself is now flirting with. 

I'm very pessimistic about the future of America; as someone who loved America, it actually brings a tear to my eyes to see the greatest experiment in the world to come to a screeching end. It actually saddens me profoundly to think of so many people living under dictatorships in other countries who once made the statue of liberty with papers and straws, who openly protested and championed for freedom and democracy, under the threat of torture, imprisonment, and death. 

That kind of admiration for America in other countries, during the heyday of cold war, most likely will be gone forever. ",little_asian99,5889,1617,0.8199999928474426,0.5540805059112254,1759091569,/r/changemyview/comments/1nsyup5/cmv_america_will_never_be_able_to_recover_from/,2025,9
1nnjy9t,"CMV: It is perfectly reasonable to call MAGA Nazis, Fascists, Authoritarians, ect. in common parlance because the distinctions between those terms are technical quibbles and MAGA are right in the middle of the Tyranical Venn Diagram.","So this has come up recently in more than a few places: [https://mndaily.com/204755/opinion/opeditorialschneider-5ba7f7a796c60/](https://mndaily.com/204755/opinion/opeditorialschneider-5ba7f7a796c60/)

Now, like it or not, the ""Nazis"" label is currently being used as a general term for authoritarianism. You could argue that anything that is not Hitler's party circa the 1930s and 40s doesn't count as Nazism. Fair enough.   
  
But people drawing that distinction remind me a lot of people who draw a distinction between pedophiles who rape children before or after puberty. They are technically correct that there is a difference. But if you have to draw that distinction the people you are talking about are already morally in the sewer.  
  
This common parlance usage has been going on for some time. Over 20 years ago in 2003, Lawrence Britt wrote this list of early warning signs of ""Fascism"":

1. Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism
2. Disdain for the importance of human rights
3. Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause
4. The supremacy of the military/avid militarism
5. Rampant sexism
6. A controlled mass media
7. Obsession with national security
8. Religion and ruling elite tied together
9. Power of corporations protected
10. Power of labor suppressed or eliminated
11. Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts
12. Obsession with crime and punishment
13. Rampant cronyism and corruption
14. Fraudulent elections

How accurate are all these to historical Fascism? I've read lots of differing arguments about it. But they are all pretty close and also clearly things Trump and his ilk are currently doing.   
  
They are also things his supporters will try and claim he isn't doing by twisting things into the most unreasonable definitions and sub categories possible. You've all heard these arguments: his fake electors scheme doesn't count as ""a fraudulent election"" because it didn't technically work; he doesn't \*control\* the media, he just threatens them with federal lawsuits and having their broadcast licenses revoked when they say something he doesn't like. That's not the same.

Can you construct an argument against all of these things that defines MAGA's actions as slightly different categorically? Technically yes.   
  
Does the fact that you had to come up with specific narrow arguments to technically separate him from all of this very slightly tell you how close he is to all of these things? Also yes. 

Basically, you can try to hair split your way out of it, but MAGA's clearly doing really, \*really\* bad things and is probably planning worse. We have seen a lot of people do a lot of extremely similar, if not identical, things in the past and using those past movements as shorthand is not uncalled for.  
  
We can sort out MAGA's phylogeny after their reign of terror has stopped. 

CMV by telling me why using the historical terms for the current evil distracts us from stopping the current evil.

1nsv0wd,"CMV: The rise of ICE is proof that after the past 50 years, conservatives / Republicans have always wanted a police state.","The litany of abuses by ICE just in the past few months, from not granting people basic Constitutional rights, to ignoring legal documents long enough to whisk people away to undisclosed locations, is a long line of consistent pro-police state behavior from conservatives / Republicans over past 50 years. 

In 1971, Richard Nixon started the first Drug War policies, along with the creation of the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration), where it was flat out admitted by high level people that it was to disrupt African American and anti-war communities. 

In the 80's, Ronald Reagan single-handedly invented the modern prison-industrial complex with his Drug War policies, where the inmate population ballooned to the millions (Bill Clinton also went further with his crime bills) , along with Iran-Contra, where he was deliberately setting up minority communities to fail. One of the biggest aspects was the militarization of the police force, and new crimes being added, many carrying long sentences. 

On Ronald Reagan, he passed the first major gun control policies to combat the Black Panthers during the Civil Rights Movement, showing that even then he didn't care about individual rights

Post 9/11, Republicans passed the Patriot Act, which enabled the open creation of a surveillance state (admittedly Obama also pushed that much further with his own policies).

Circle to the past 10 years where it's proven that marijuana isn't dangerous, numerous states have legalized it, but the people preventing marijuana from being legal are Republican states, and conservatives in Congress. Both of which are influenced by private prison lobbies.

Now the last couple of months has seen ICE swell in its power, with Trump and his supporters (both voters and legislators) encouraging its actions, regardless of the constitutionality of their actions. 

It's proven that Republican/conservatives have always preferred granting law enforcement agencies increased power to handle their specific cause. 

Would love for my view to be changed. ",Tessenreacts,4441,1015,0.8799999952316284,0.3850737136511796,1759082518,/r/changemyview/comments/1nsv0wd/cmv_the_rise_of_ice_is_proof_that_after_the_past/,2025,9
1nmgabe,CMV: The anger people on the left have is aimed at right wing politicians and government officials. The anger people have on the right is aimed at regular left leaning people.,"When I hear people on the left complaining about the state of the country, it’s always aimed up. It’s aimed at Trump, it’s aimed at Republican senators and governors and house reps. It’s aimed at right wing billionaires. You’ll occasionally see left wing people ripping on rednecks and “the guy from their high school posting right wing memes on Facebook”, but that never comes off as anger, it comes off like they’re making fun of them. 

Right wing people’s anger doesn’t go up, it goes across. It’s at their friend who stopped talking to them because they disagreed with their views on Covid. It’s at the teachers “indoctrinating” their kids. It’s at the regular people gleefully celebrating the murder of a person because they held similar views to them. Again, you’ll see right wing people ripping on Biden or Pelosi or AOC, but it comes off more like they’re making fun of them, and less angry than the contempt they have for their left wing peers. 

I understand both angers. Obviously I understand hating Trump and the old men running the country who refuse to leave. But I also understand the contempt right wing people have for regular left wing people due to how they’ve treated them for years. 

The reason I bring this up is because it seems like the hatred the right has for the left is more fundamental and more lasting. It doesn’t matter who the left runs in 2028, because that’s not what they’re mad at. They’re mad at all the regular left leaning people who belittled them for years, and a good left wing candidate won’t win any of them over. 

Obviously this is all extremely subjective, but if anybody has a different take I’m definitely willing to change my view. 

EDIT: to be more succinct, most of the anger left wing people have stems from how Trump made them feel. Most of the anger right wing people have stems from how the left wing people in their lives have made them feel.

1nsqpit,CMV: Western anti-immigration rhetoric is deeply hypocritical and ignores the global system they created.,"      I’m young, I’m Tanzanian, and I know I don’t have all the answers. But from where I stand, the way immigration is framed in the West feels not only unfair, but hypocritical to the point of cruelty.

Here’s why:

•	You kept us underdeveloped on purpose. For decades, Europe and the US blocked African countries from industrializing. Britain and France actively resisted West African attempts to build chocolate factories or oil refineries because you wanted the raw materials cheap. France still runs Françafrique, keeping entire economies on a leash. Then you turn around and sneer at “economic migrants” like it’s our personal failure.
	•	Visas are cages. I visited the EU this summer. It took 4 months of humiliating paperwork and €350 just to stay 10 days. Meanwhile, Westerners flash their passports and stroll into our countries without question—often to exploit cheap labor, beaches, and women. The inequality is baked into your passports.
	•	History’s double standard. Europeans once scattered across the globe like locusts—colonizing, stealing land, enforcing religion, enslaving, extracting wealth because Europe was a mess and you wanted out. But now, when Africans seek the tiniest fraction of that mobility, suddenly it’s “protect our borders.” You enriched yourselves by invading the world, but we’re “parasites” for legally applying for visas?
	•	Integration doesn’t matter. We study, we work, we learn your languages, we try to fit in. But to you, I’m still just a “dangerous Black Muslim African” before I even open my mouth. You don’t see humans, you see caricatures.
	•	And then there’s the sickest hypocrisy. Western “passport bros” come to our countries, use their wealth and privilege to exploit women, film it for clout, and brag about “easy wives.” That’s somehow tolerated, even celebrated in some corners. But when Africans seek opportunity in your countries—through work, study, or marriage—we’re portrayed as predators? How’s that not the ultimate double standard?

So yes, I’m angry. Because the West stole the world, broke it, hoarded the wealth, and now demonizes anyone who dares to cross the fences you built.

I also deeply hurt by the rhetoric that right wingers are using to describe people like me. I’ve lived in Tanzania all my life, all my friends and family are Tanzanian. We might not have much but we’re good people but in the eyes of western right wingers, we’re savages who have savage cultures and are not suited for civilised society. It’s dehumanising and heartbreaking. I love learning about the western world and its history and culture but it’s sad how your people portray mine.

1nuq3od,"CMV: Sharia law is incompatible with a secular, non-Islamic society","For those that don’t know, secular means attitudes activities or other related things that have no religious or spiritual basis. Most of the “West” — meaning places like the UK, France and the US — are considered secular in spite of the fact many of their moral precepts are based on Christian theology/ethics. It doesn’t mean you can’t be devout believers in whatever faith you profess, it just means faith becomes a private, individual matter instead of a public, collective one. 

Sharia is incompatible with that. Most Muslims want/believe in some form of institutionalized religious law that caters to their faith. Which isn’t itself problematic in a a religiously homogenous society but in one where you need to separate church from state or one where there’s more then *one faith* it becomes an issue. Especially for religions like Judaism and Christianity which had to undergo the sometimes painful, fraught process of secularization and now watch Muslims get treated with a double standard. 

In France for example there’s growing evidence that older and younger French born Muslims all support Sharia law over French law and would like to see it instituted. But once you give an inch there’s no going back. It becomes a right they’re now entitled to and they’ll fight for more.

1ndracw,cmv: gun control laws would not have prevented Charlie Kirk's death,"So I think a point I disagree with is people associating Charlie's 2nd amendment stance with his unfortunate passing. I think this confuses types of weapons and types of shootings.

The arguments for gun control are typically associated with mass shootings. We all know the story. Someone gets an AR-15, or some type of gun with high magazine capacity, to end as many lives as possible. The indiscriminate harm in theory can be reduced by restricting certain types of guns. This does make sense. Slower fire guns or guns with smaller magazines reduce the time period to cause indiscriminate harm.

However, Charlie's situation is very different:

* A single shot was fired.
* No one else was targeted at the shooting.
* The weapon used is a long range gun with a slow rate of fire and very small magazine capacity. 
* This type of shot requires training and accuracy, likely acquired through a legal form of training or permits. (Note: not confirmed, but my judgement)

It would be very hard to have gun control laws prevent this because:

* It would require banning nearly all guns, which is far more difficult than what gun control advocates call for.
* Assassinations can be carried out with many types of weapons, when the focus is a single person. The light rail murder is an example. 

To change my view, you can present ideas or evidence of how a gun control law could have prevented this incident.",Healthy_Shine_8587,608,1531,0.6499999761581421,0.2758738476252133,1757540846,/r/changemyview/comments/1ndracw/cmv_gun_control_laws_would_not_have_prevented/,2025,9

1nc0kj1,CMV: Family courts are not “anti-men”. Custody is usually about caregiving history,"The men’s rights argument is that courts favour women. 

But in most cases, custody goes to mothers because they have been the primary caregiver before separation. 

Courts try to minimise disruption to the child’s life, not punish fathers. When fathers are equally involved, studies show their chances of shared or primary custody are far higher than MRAs suggest.

Why should courts ignore caregiving history and force equal custody when the child’s best interest is stability?

Also, child support isn’t a “penalty” against men. 

It’s about covering the child’s expenses in line with each parent’s income. 

Since men, on average, earn more than women, they more often become the payers. That’s not gender bias, it’s math. If mothers earned more and fathers got custody, the roles would reverse.

1njbwny,CMV: The front page of Reddit has been radicalized to the point of no return.,"I've been on reddit for over 12 years now, and can say with absolute certainty, that the standard front page posts and comments (news, politics, pics, etc) have been co-opted by bad actors and bots which has created more discourse and radicalization which is not a benefit to society. There was a time when nuance could be explored, but that time is long gone by the downvote brigade. Now, reddit exists only in extreme black and white scenarios with finger pointing and whataboutism being the main source of discussion.

I believe that this shift is all by design predating the decision for reddit to go public as a company. To my memory, the shift naturally started during Trump's first term as president. Trump might possibly be the greatest thing to ever happen to Reddit in terms of shareholder profitability. He sowed division both in the nation and online. This created far greater engagement on reddit due to its left leaning user base. People love to hate, and people love to come together to hate. It's good for business. 

Now, every front page thread feels as if it has been *manufactured* to create more discourse. Articles are posted constantly with misinformation, disinformation, or just half-ass stories that have not yet been verified. The comments are all the same. Literally, it's as if there's a playbook of starter comments for all of these posts. 

I have great concerns over the growing bot problem on reddit. The opinions of the masses are being swayed because of high visibility from the same (few) upvoted comments. Many usernames are very obviously generated with the same formula of name_name#. Take a look at these profiles and they're marked as ""NSFW"" for some reason without any scandalous posts or comments.

Trump has played into the southern strategy perfectly, which has only amplified it, with his strong white nationalist agenda.

Truthfully, I don’t even see how he’d be physically forced out this time because, again, of his private army of ICE.

And perhaps worst of all, we’re at a point where the Republican Party is in full gaslight mode. They’re already essentially all on board with branding the entire Democratic party as domestic terrorists, so I could easily see them using that as justification for not handing over the keys.

1nmvil3,CMV: Anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic and should not automatically be conflated with antisemitism,"*Definitions:*

Zionism = support for the existence of a Jewish state in Palestine/Israel.

Anti-Zionism = opposition to that political project.

Antisemitism = hostility, prejudice or discrimination directed at Jews as a people.

*In its most basic form, my argument is as follows:*

P1. A substantial share of global Zionist support comes from non-Jews.

P2. Many Jewish Zionists approach Zionism as a secular, cultural, or political project rather than a religious doctrine.

P3. Some Jews oppose Zionism on explicitly religious or ethical grounds.

C. Therefore, anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic and should not automatically be conflated with hostility toward Jews.

*The evidence in support of P1, P2, and P3 is as follows:*

P1:

Zionism, though emerging from Jewish history and identity, has long drawn enthusiastic supporters well beyond the Jewish community. In the United States, Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia, tens of millions of evangelical Christians embrace Christian Zionism, regarding the modern State of Israel as central to biblical prophecy or as a strategic ally. These constituencies lobby governments, fund settlement projects, and organise pilgrimages, making non-Jewish Zionists one of the largest and most politically influential pro-Israel blocs worldwide.

This breadth of support shows that Zionism is not exclusively a Jewish ideology and that backing the existence of a Jewish state is not synonymous with being Jewish.

P2:

Within the Jewish world, a large proportion of Zionists identify as secular or cultural rather than religious. The founders of modern political Zionism (Theodor Herzl, Max Nordau, Ahad Ha-Am, David Ben-Gurion) were themselves non-observant and motivated by nationalism, cultural revival, and political security. Contemporary data reinforce this pattern: surveys of Israeli Jews and the wider diaspora (e.g. Pew Research Center, Jewish People Policy Institute) consistently show that many who call themselves Zionist describe their Jewishness in cultural or ethnic terms and place little or no emphasis on religious observance.

This demonstrates that even among Jews, Zionism is primarily a political-national movement rather than a theological mandate.

P3:

Jewish opposition to Zionism is likewise well documented. Ultra-Orthodox groups such as Neturei Karta and the Satmar Hasidim reject the creation of a secular Jewish state as a violation of divine will, arguing that Jewish sovereignty must await the Messiah.  Other Jews, religious and secular alike, criticise Zionism or particular Israeli policies on ethical or humanitarian grounds, citing principles of justice and universal human rights. Their critiques are grounded in conscience, not hostility toward their own people.

This internal diversity shows that principled anti-Zionism exists within Judaism itself.

*Conclusion:*

Taken together, these premises provide a coherent basis for distinguishing anti-Zionism from antisemitism. The large non-Jewish Zionist constituency, the predominantly secular character of much Jewish Zionism, and the presence of Jewish critics acting from religious or ethical conviction all demonstrate that opposition to Zionism is a political or moral stance, not evidence of hatred toward Jews. This does not deny that antisemitic rhetoric sometimes appears within anti-Zionist movements, but it shows that anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic and should not automatically be conflated with hostility toward Jews.

Therefore, anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic and should not automatically be conflated with antisemitism.",SummumOpus,540,1150,0.6499999761581421,0.21139181259662854,1758469875,/r/changemyview/comments/1nmvil3/cmv_antizionism_is_not_inherently_antisemitic_and/,2025,9

This post was inspired by an [astounding story](https://unherd.com/newsroom/cologne-immigration-pact-opens-door-for-afd/) out of German local elections. All parties other then the AFD have agreed not to talk about some of the negative consequences of immigration.

1na6kzw,CMV: I believe access to abortion should be legal and unrestricted up to viability.,"I believe that individuals should have the legal right to access abortion without significant legal or logistical barriers, at least up until fetal viability (around 23–24 weeks). To me, bodily autonomy is a foundational principle of a free society, and I don't think the government should have the power to force someone to remain pregnant against their will.

I also believe that restricting access to abortion disproportionately affects people in poverty, people of color, and those in rural areas, making it an issue of social justice as well as personal liberty.

I understand that others view the fetus as a life with rights, and I do think the moral complexity increases later in pregnancy, especially after viability. But prior to that, I believe the pregnant person's rights should take clear precedence.

1nik218,cmv: The Epstein files are definitive proof that it was never about “political differences.”,"The fact that virtually every congress votes is along party lines is always characterized as the US being “hyper partisan” - that the differences in politics between the parties are simply too far apart to find common ground. For whatever difference it makes, I am roughly even in my skepticism of both parties. I am NOT a centrist, I am not “seeing both sides” or taking a middle position between them. But I’ve never been a Democrat and I couldn’t give a shit if they’re considered “good guys” or not. 

But the Epstein files prove, without a doubt, that Republicans are nothing but corrupt enablers. If this were about politics, Epstein would stand for everything Republicans hate. They favor law and order, crime and punishment, they consider pedophiles and sex traffickers the absolute worst kind of people, they claim to seek transparency and letting people “form their own opinions.” 

In fact, when Biden was president and Democrats were in charge of Homeland Security, Democrats weren’t saying anything about Epstein. It was Republicans who were using his case as a rallying cry and a demand for accountability. 

But when it became apparent that the files were critical of Trump, Republicans abandoned EVERYTHING they stand for and rallied behind protecting their party leader.

1nisp78,CMV: Most American's have ZERO Concept of Left of Center Politics,"I genuinely believe that people have no idea the nuances of the Left leaning political ""labels"", and this causes them to attribute the most extreme political stances on ""lefties"", who ironically don't actually subscribe to said stances. This also has the side effect, of making the left seem chaotic and ""less principled"" when in actuality each ""subset"" of the left is pretty defined and consistent.

*Note: in the global Political Overton window, Social Democrat would be the CENTER. Only in America, is a Social Democrat considered left leaning.*

\* >!Bill Clinton was left of Reagan, but he was not left in the modern scope of the democratic party. His administration pushed the party to the right. He softened many of Reagans policies but did not reverse/dismantle them (ex. Reagan took top marginal tax from 70% to 28%, while Clinton took it back to 39%). Triangulation was a fancy word for doing what was advantages politically, as the democrats were desperate for relevance in a 12 year executive branch drought (the longest in the modern era).!<

\* >!Some folks may argue that Obama is a strong lefty, but that isn't really true in his policies. Even a lot of his deficits were because of rebuilding the economy. He was left-ish on social issues, but largely response/defensive when it came to the economy.!<

# Conflation

Neo-Libs are market/corporate driven, and are willing to lean left if it is politically advantageous. They are the leading cause of American's confusion regarding the left. There is an argument to be made that the democratic elite are still Neo-Libs. The leadership of the Democratic party like Chuck Shurmur and Nancy Pelosi are barely approaching Obama left. They started their political career during Reagan's, Bush Sr., or Clinton's administrations. Democratic elites actively oppose the folks to the left of them. So when you say CNN is the propaganda arm of the democrats, then the correct appraisal is that CNN is AT BEST center left.

On the actual Left spectrum, there is Bernie sanders and progressives who don't even hold many of the positions that people attribute to them, while also being conflated against the likes of Nancy Pelosi. The democratic elites' failures and insincerity get attributed to folks like Sanders. The fact that Obama's economic mishaps are used as critiques of progressive policies is eye-opening. 

This is where it gets confusing, Bernie is to the right of the actual American socialist. The Democratic Socialist of America (The DSA) aims to use democracy to nationalize many institutions. Like air travel being government ran instead of market driven. Bernie Sanders really only wants Progressive taxes and Medicare for All. Barely talks about much else. Is this radical left? 

Speaking of,

America has also semantically misconstrued Extreme and Radical. Radical is now synonymous with violence, when it was originally a measure of scale. Extreme is the violent and potentially revolutionary political lean. America has some radical figure heads. The left has none who are prominent. You can't even name them and if you could I don't think the average American can. Those radicals 100% do not have the ear of the democratic elite or the corporate oligarchy. What Policy are these folks shaping and where are the signs?

I guess the CMV is if you can change my mind, that the American people DO understand the nuance of the left. Or if misattribution of stances is somehow justified. Ironically this misattribution of political ideas is largely why the right is irate of the left. Is social issues alone significant enough to define someones politics?

1n8dp5x,CMV: Digital piracy is not inherently wrong in a world where “buying” media doesn’t mean ownership,"We live in a licensing economy. When you “buy” a movie on Amazon, or a game on Steam, or an eBook on Kindle, you aren’t really purchasing it in the traditional sense, you’re buying the right to access it, under terms that can be revoked at any time. Companies can and do pull purchased titles, lock them behind DRM (Digital Rights Management), or outright delete them from your account.

So if buying isn’t ownership, why should piracy be treated as theft? Theft implies taking something away from someone else, but piracy doesn’t deprive the rights holder of their copy. At worst, it bypasses a license. At best, it restores consumer autonomy that greedy corporations have systematically stripped away.

If we accept that:

1. You don’t truly own what you “buy,”

2. Corporations have effectively rented culture back to us with strings attached,

3. And piracy provides the same (or better) access without pretending at ownership—


then digital piracy seems more like leveling the playing field than stealing. It’s a form of consumer resistance against artificially restricted access to our own culture.

1nqpr1y,CMV: The Epstein List is the real distraction.,"I am incredibly exhausted with people who are ostensibly on my side who believe that the death, destruction, economic instability, ethnic purges, democratic backsliding, and general corruption of the Trump administration are all just a distraction from the really important thing: who’s on The List. The reality is that it is the other way around.

If the Epstein list even does exist (which assumes he was stupid enough to just maintain a master list of clients, and he and his associates were stupid enough not to destroy it once the Feds came calling), its revelation to the public would mean nothing. We have lists of the people who visited his island and flew on his plane, so the exposure of the list would only exonerate people, not implicate anyone who isn’t already a suspect.

If Trump is on the list, it would mean nothing. MAGA would claim the Biden admin created it or manipulated it. Maybe a sliver of conservatives who like Trump but aren’t super interested in politics might split off from him, but most of the people who could have a “Trump is bad actually” wakeup call have probably already had it, in year 9 of this circus.

It seems like for the last month, all liberals have wanted to talk about is the Epstein list, and they’ve entirely forgotten that Israel is currently moving forward with its plan to annex Gaza. They cared for a hot minute that the FCC is trying to take anyone who defies Trump off the air, but now we’re back to Epstein. And I’ve seen no posts as of yet about the fact that Pete Hegseth is going to do a Stalin-style purge of the military next Tuesday.

I do not care one bit who is on the Epstein list. Other than possibly some celebrities, anyone who might be on it would be a powerful politician or businessman, i.e. I already don’t like them.

They will still hold many similar views but, I belive that each group will rally around a new leader, many of them likely being on a local level, some on a regional and some on a national but, thier unity will be gone.

There will be a lot more political violence as they struggle to make thier specific group relevant.

1nad88n,CMV: It's illogical and suspicious when modern white Americans feel personally attacked by criticisms of historical slave owners and racists," I want to try and understand a phenomenon I see all the time.  
  
Whenever there's a discussion about the actions of  racist historical figures (like a founding father who owned slaves or a 19th century politician who enacted racist policies )some white Americans react as if they are being personally attacked in the present day. I believe this reaction is not only illogical but also creates suspicion where there might not need to be any.  
  
One of the the ways this shows up is when talking about the fact that chattel slavery was bad and somebody goes  ""Well, Black people owned slaves too!"" .This is often presented as a ""gotcha"" moment, as if it should make Black people feel hypocritical or ashamed.  
  
As a Black person, I might roll mt etes so hard a contact falls out but I don't , and othe rblack people, dont feel any kind of motivation to defend those people. The handful of Black individuals who participated in the chattel slave system  as actual owners are viewed as sellouts, traitors, and awful human beings by black people 

  
I bet most people, Black or white, can't even name one of them. This isn't because they didn't exist; it's because we feel no need to celebrate, defend, or build nuance around them. There are no statues of William Ellison Jr. We don't name schools after him. His actions aren't seen as a reflection on us, because we universally condemn what he did. We see no need to try and celebrate teh :culture"" of a black slave owner.  We see them as suckers who were on the wrong side of history.  
  
So for the people who do feel some kind of way just because an evill person from 200 years ago shares your skin color (or hair texture) Why are yall taking on that burden Criticizing the institution of slavery and the people who upheld it is not an attack on a modern person's identity. Acknowledging that a historical figure was a brutal slave owner is not an indictment of you, a person living in 2025. Holding the government accountable and not sugar coating it is not abouut attack you, since you aren't the gov  
  
And  when someone rushes to defend that historical figure or deflect the criticism, it feels profoundly weird. It makes me wonder, ""Why feel the need to take up for this racist person from 200 years ago?"" It's like you are voluntarily taking on the burden of their sins.  
  
This reaction (for me at least)  is what creates suspicion. It makes us feel like you aren't just defending a historical figure, but that you identify with them and are, on some level, defending the ideology that powered their actions. Suddenly, a conversation about history becomes a tense interaction in the present, because now we're questioning your motives. Now if yuou benefit from the prison industrial complex and private prisons in America  were modern slavery is still constitutional and ok, then yeah we don't like  your ass,  but its because of what you are doin in the prsent   
  
So, CMV: Help me understand this defensive reaction. Is there a logical reason for a modern person to feel personally attacked by a critique of a long-dead racist that I'm missing?

1n8mwjl,"CMV: Cheating is always, without exception, the responsibility of the person who cheated","Whenever cheating comes up, there’s often this attempt to spread the blame. People say things like, “Well, maybe if the partner had been more attentive, or more exciting, or more supportive, the cheating wouldn’t have happened.” 

But I’ve thought about this a lot, and I’m convinced that cheating is always, without exception, the responsibility of the person who cheats.

Why? Because no matter what problems exist in a relationship, the cheating partner always has other choices. If someone is unhappy, they can communicate. They can try counselling. They can suggest a break. They can even leave. What they can’t do, without crossing a moral line, is betray the trust they agreed to uphold. 

Cheating isn’t some inevitable force of nature; it’s a deliberate act that requires secrecy and deception. That’s why the fault lies solely with the person who makes that choice.

Think about it: if a student is struggling in class because the teacher isn’t very engaging, is it the teacher’s fault if the student cheats on an exam? Of course not. The student still chose to cheat, even if they had valid frustrations. Relationships work the same way. Dissatisfaction is never an excuse for betrayal.

1n6tlrc,"CMV: Conservatives would probably be okay with, or even defend pre-1939 Hitler.","Heres a take that will make a lot of conservatives assmad, if you took Hitlers pre-1939 policies and rhetoric, stripped the name ''Hitler'' off, and just described them in plain terms, a lot of conservatives today would not only be fine with them, they'd cheer them on. I actually did this with a family member who lives in Florida, i ascribed a bunch of Hitlers' policies and rhetoric onto Trump, and he defended them, and then once i said that actually those were Hitlers, he kinda laughed and said ''You got me there kid'' and moved on lol.

Hitler didnt roll out of bed one day and build Auschwitz. Pre-1939, his moves were ''defending tradition'', ''restoring order'', and ''making Germany great again'' Sound familiar?

Demonizing minorities as scapegoats: Hitler blamed Jews for Germanys economic and social decline. Trump does the same with immigrants, Muslims, and anyone he can label as an ''outsider'' ruining America.

Cult of personality and nationalism: Hitler positioned himself as Germanys savior, demanding total loyalty. Trump does the same, openly bragging about being above the law and demanding loyalty oaths, like when Bill Barr, a huge Trump dickrider, when he wouldn't lie about the 2020 election for him, he was instantly exiled from the party, and conservatives still, to this day, call him a RINO.

Attacking the press: Hitler called journalists ''Lugenpresse'' (lying press). Trump calls the media the ''enemy of the people'' and spams lawsuits to anyone who says mean things about him.

Undermining democracy: Hitler didnt destroy the Weimar republic overnight, he chipped away at it, attacking elections, delegitimizing opponents, and normalizing authoritarian power grabs. Trump literally tried to overturn an election he lost in 2020, he lost the election, fabricated lies about how it was a top-down conspiracy to steal the election from him, and then tried to pressure officials to ''find votes'', then tried to steal the vote through false slates of electors and an insurrection.

Violent rhetoric and political intimidation: Hitler used brownshirts to intimidate opponents. Trump calls on his supporters to ''fight like hell'' and send his people to storm the capitol in an attempt to stay in power, excuses political violence (Jan 6), and promises pardons for insurrectionists.

If you presented all that to conservatives today without saying the name Hitler, they'd probably defend it, or even be okay with it. And if you did point out it was Hitler, they'd say ''Well, Trump hasn't built death camps yet'' and dismiss the comparison outright, proving my point.

The problem is people think Hitler only became Hitler when the Holocaust started. But by then, the groundwork was already laid, and it was too late. Thats why making these comparisons matters now. Pretending everythings fine until the gas chambers show up is historically illiterate and politically suicidal.

And for the dumbasses who is just gonna ask me about if i think Trump is gonna build death camps or whatever, no, i dont think that, and thats not the point of the comparison.

Also, anyone that wanna say im trivializing the holocaust victims or whatever, Anne Franks sister, a holocaust survivor, has also made the same comparison, so if you say im trivializing it, say the same to a survivor of it.",123kallem,393,645,0.7200000286102295,0.12307607373631838,1756842618,/r/changemyview/comments/1n6tlrc/cmv_conservatives_would_probably_be_okay_with_or/,2025,9
1n9utv1,CMV: The Media Needs To Stop 'Girlsplaining' Men's Loneliness. This Isn’t Helping,"Lately, I’ve posts and videos along the lines of “Men under 30 are single because they don’t talk about their feelings.”

I want to push back on this, because it feels incredibly condescending almost like a form of ""girlsplaining."" It’s not that I am struggling to form friendships or can’t express myself emotionally. That narrative is overly simplistic and honestly insulting. I've spoke to some of my Dads Matters friends and they have the same feeling around this matter. It assumes we’re emotionally stunted children who just need to “be better” or “open up” and all of our problems will magically be solved.

Telling men to “do better” or to “just talk about feelings” is about as helpful as telling a depressed person to “just cheer up.” as I would know as I have had clinical depression since I was 19 now i'm 31 and a single Dad. It might sound good and empowering, but it’s vague and completely ignores the social reality we live in. Modern men are told to be more open.. to share our struggles, to express our vulnerability. But when we actually do it, the response is often dismissive, mocking, or outright rejecting. I have lost female and male friends over the years just from opening up, the word 'high maintenence' was used. Would friends prefer their friends were emotionless?

That’s the part these commentators keep missing.

When a guy tells his friends or family that he’s lonely, the answer is often, “Man up,” “Just hit the gym,” or “Stop whining.” When a guy tells a date that he’s having a hard time, there’s a risk it will be seen as weakness or neediness. Even on social media, when men post honestly about feeling isolated or hopeless, the comments can be brutal: “This is why you can’t get a girlfriend,” “Be a man,” or worse, outright shaming.

So yes, men could talk more about our feelings but we already know that talking isn’t free. There’s a social cost to it, and the people telling us to “open up” rarely address that.

That’s why so many of these takes feel like ragebait. They frame men’s loneliness as a problem men are too stubborn to solve, as if we secretly enjoy being isolated. It’s blaming the patient for the disease.

If people were genuinely trying to help, here’s what would actually be constructive:

Stop generalizing. Not all men are emotionally closed-off cavemen.

Stop being vague... what does “do better” even mean in practical terms?

Stop being patronizing... we don’t need lectures, we need allies.

In person and online socials to male vulnerability is often negative... and that this is a cultural issue, not just a “men won’t talk” issue.


This isn’t about rejecting growth or refusing to be emotionally healthy. It’s about asking people especially journalists and influencers to diagnose the problem honestly instead of falling back on topics they do not fully understand nore have the degrees to make unqualified explainations. If we want to reduce male loneliness, we have to talk about the stigma men face when we actually do share. Otherwise, all this advice is just performative noise.


Out of all the things I've seen online I would say this is the worst... https://youtube.com/shorts/-ZNZIq71IlU?feature=shared",John_GOOP,931,475,0.7799999713897705,0.12276146207126656,1757149315,/r/changemyview/comments/1n9utv1/cmv_the_media_needs_to_stop_girlsplaining_mens/,2025,9
1nirejb,"CMV: As an American born in 1968, 2025 is the first time in my life that I need to be concerned about being targeted or attacked by my own government for speaking out politically.","It is often said that the First Amendment doesn't mean your speech, expression and opinions are free from consequences.  It only means that you are protected from the *government* implementing consequences for your speech, expression and opinions.  I do not believe that is true in 2025 (since Trump's second term began).

Never before have I had to worry about criticizing a President or other politician.  Prior to 2025, I was never gave a second thought to saying something critical of the government or a politician on the town square, or posting something online.  

I was cognizant that those expressions *could* be used by my employer, friends, acquaintances and others to make evaluations of my character and determine their future involvement with me in their lives.  But I was never hesitant to express those opinions because I thought it would make me a target of the government.

But now I find myself holding back on some expressions *precisely* because I fear reprisal from the government.  Do I think I'll get thrown in prison for months or years because of my speech?  No (at least not in 2025, but check back in a few years).  But will government harass me at customs after an overseas trip because of my speech?  Yes, it's a concern.  Will police and prosecutors treat me differently if they're aware of my speech critical of the government?  Yes, I think they will.

Some of it comes from just an overall change in tone from the government since the Trump administration took over.  But a lot of it is just listening to what the administration says.  Things like Pam Bondi saying that they'll come after people for ""hate speech"".  Or the DOJ investigating people (like John Bolton) that Trump considers to be personal enemies.

So there are two ways my view could be changed here.  First, you could point out that I always should have been moderating my speech for fear of government blowback.  I considered whether this was true during Trump's first term, but I don't think it was.  We went through the George Floyd protests without government really targeting people simply for their words and other expressions of speech.  And outside of Trump's first term, I don't see any time in my lifetime that it would even be debatable that people needed to be concerned.

The second way to change my view would be to show me and convince me that I'm just being paranoid and that the government doesn't really care about what the fuck I say, no matter how critical it is.  I think that used to be true as an ""average Joe"".  No one in government would ever really know what I said.  But now we've got a whole MAGA army of online warriors who bring speech they disagree with to the attention of people in government.  That never really happened before the days of social media.

I also don't think the argument of ""Trump has bigger fish to fry; you don't need to worry"" works for me.  Logically, you would think they'd go after someone like AOC or Gavin Newsome before worrying about little ol me.  But I think that those more prominent critics have some protection (that I don't have) simply because they have a bullhorn.  If Newsome got detained for 8 hours by Customs after an overseas trip, it'd be international news for days.  But if it happens to me, no one would ever even know about it.",ProblematicTrumpCard,1456,303,0.8700000047683716,0.12147532354851134,1758051352,/r/changemyview/comments/1nirejb/cmv_as_an_american_born_in_1968_2025_is_the_first/,2025,9
1nshaiz,CMV: the main reason for sending the National Guard into Portland is to foment “left wing” violence that justifies a full “left wing” crackdown,"During the previous Trump administration, Portland, Oregon was a wellspring for right wing propaganda about reactionary left and right wing. Since the main provocateurs that time were right wing paramilitary cosplayers that weren’t very appealing themselves, the mainstream perception wasn’t a tidy narrative that could be easily capitalized on: for those that didn’t look closely, it was a situation out of control. 

Today, we have the federal government spoiling for a fight—attempting to provoke an antifa response: the Republicans badly need this response to position themselves properly for the 2026 election:

1.  Any supposed organized violence will be used as a propaganda victory: the left is violent and against law and order. 

2.  That violence - insofar as it can be - will be a pretext to cut off political funding to wide swathes of loosely connected left wing groups during an election year: “we see links between Portland’s ANTIFA groups and mainstream democratic groups and their funding of violence must be frozen in its tracks.” A pliant Supreme Court will likely allow this overreach during a key window of fundraising and advertising and message, as they have with all manner of executive power. They may later leash it back, but it would be in June or July of 2026, too late to make a difference. 

3.  The federal control of the situation will not have the same problems that non-federal crime has: hapless, semi-competent, less politically aligned local law enforcement.  It will be all Republican controlled investigations and communications. Being able to have the full end-to-end control can yield a better propaganda outcome. 

4. They just have to keep it contained to Portland, though, because they have realized that it is far harder to control the “left wing violence” story in major media markets like New York, DC and LA: there are too many people who are too connected and don’t fit their script easily enough, so they risk looking like bullies as much as powerful leaders.

1n83fts,CMV: Trump sending the guard into Chicago will accomplish absolutely nothing long term. Looking at you conservatives.,"Recently served 8 years. Sergeant in Active Army Infantry and Army National Guard Infantry with 2x deployments, 1 SE mobilization, and a couple activations to wildfires, George Floyd riots/protests, and orders to the border at one point. Served during later half of Obama's 2nd term and through Trump's 1st term. 

I'd also truly like to hear from conservative and conservate veterans on their logic if they support Trump's decision. And yes my POV is sassy lol. 

My POV: 

Anyone who's served in the guard knows most activations like these are a complete waste of time. 

What did we do at the border? And dont even lie. We sat around and looked busy and we hurried up and waited for nothing. We weren't tackling immigrants or chasing them down like NFL linebackers. They didn't even have the logistics to know what to do with us nor the resources to even keep us there long term. A quarter of the guys weren't even getting paid right and half had their orders cut into half so they couldn't qualify for BAH. We weren't shooting immigrants, and we'd post up at some random spot and do jack shit. A few dudes on longer term orders might be flying Ravens but that's separate from a unit activation. Didn't matter Texas guard, Cali guard, or AZ guard. We weren't doing shit. 

Even especially today, 95% of guard dudes have never deployed and barely do any legit MOS training outside of their 2-3 week semi-casual AT in the summer at whichever Fort Shithole(in this case probably McCoy or the Indiana one). 

You think we're going to post squads of privates and specialists in O-block and have them return fire against gangs in the area? Get real. Activate any MP unit in Illinois right now and 1/4th are 23 year old college students that barely qual and barely pass PT tests consistently. The other 1/4th construction workers or office workers, and the rest a mix of actually in law enforcement, jobless, or something else irrelevant. 

It's a dog and pony show for Trump to pander to the ""mUh ReD WHitE n BLuE. Muh HeRiTaGe"" part of America. These guard dudes are going to be kicking rocks in middle class or highly visible areas trying to look busy and not get yelled at by their plt sgt or squad leader. ""Presence patrols"" in all the neighborhoods that don't have high crime to begin with. Just like DC...kicking rocks and picking up trash. Truly Amazing crime fighters. 

It's a waste of taxpayer money, and what's even the long term goal? Just keep the guard in these cities forever and do what? Or is it going to be Trump and his traveling band of guard members going from state to state ""saving America"" one liberal city at a time. 

I genuinely want to know how Trump activating and constantly threatening to activate the guard whether Chicago or somewhere else is actually going to fight crime long term.

Most comes from the nature of subreddits turning into ecochambers and it distorts perceptions of reality and enforces extreme views.

It radicalizes users by presenting distorted views as normal.

1nnp4lq,CMV: liberal people should stay in red states,"I live in a “blueberry” city in a deep red state (Oklahoma). My city is very artsy, very queer, a center for black excellence, and has strong communities for just about any identity/interest. 

There’s an ongoing debate I’ve seen both online and in person about whether liberal/left-wing people should stay in red states, or whether they should move and join forces with likeminded people elsewhere. 

My argument: 
• The US has a maximum of 5 actually blue states. The states we think of as blue, specially California and New York, are actually red states with reallllllly big blueberries that sway the vote. 
• Because of the point above, it makes sense to stay in red states and cultivate blue cities. Taking your ideas to states with already established blue cities does less than growing those blueberries in states without them. 
• Personally I think of it as a moral imperative to stay here. Mainly to foster safety and community and protect resources for those who can’t afford to leave. The money I would use to leave is better invested in local programming. 

Counterarguments:
• Living in a red state is exhausting at best, and at worst actively dangerous. Every family, especially those with marginalized identities, should live in places that give them strength.
• Decades of liberal progress can be wiped out with a single event or bill. The Tulsa Massacre destroyed Black Wall Street. Red lining and highway building in the 80s was less obvious but had similar generational outcomes.

1njru4r,CMV: Illegal immigration is inherently unfair to legal immigrants(and citizens),"Context: Personally, I'm a second generation immigrant(asian), and my parents have always talked of how they had to wait years in order to enter the United States. Partly due to this, I always held the opinion that priority should significantly be given to legal immigrants, since they actually go through the long and arduous immigration process, rather than simply ""hopping the border."" Additionally, when I hear people talk about how they want a lot more courts in order to deal with illegal immigration cases, I also feel like this is a little unfair. These courts come at a cost, and I feel like allocating funds toward illegal immigration while the legal immigration system is a mess that almost encourage illegal immigration. 

Regarding citizens, a lot of people that oppose ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies point out that illegal immigrants commit less crimes than native-born citizens. While I do believe this statistic is true, I still feel like any crime committed by an illegal immigrant is inherently a policy failure. When it comes to crimes committed by illegal immigrants, it is a directly a product of the government's inability to enforce border control that leads to these crimes. This is really unfair, especially to the victim and the victim's family. Telling a family that their loved one was killed(just an example) just because the US was unable to reinforce their border just doesn't sit well with me. One murder committed by an illegal immigrant is one too many, and it doesn't make sense to just sit there and say that illegal immigration has no negative consequences on society(not trying to say they don't also benefit society). This issue(about crimes) I feel a little less strongly about, but since people are starting to advocate for defunding a police, something needs to be done about illegal immigrant crimes.

To wrap it up, I don't have any hard feelings against illegal immigrants or anything like that, just a belief I have that I would love to get input on from people with other worldviews, seeing as mine is pretty biased.",baljeetofficial,323,592,0.6200000047683716,0.11107485394589296,1758149433,/r/changemyview/comments/1njru4r/cmv_illegal_immigration_is_inherently_unfair_to/,2025,9
1ngoz5g,CMV: The Trump administration intentionally forces the economy into stagflation to tighten their autocratic grip on the US,"Since the beginning of the tariffs, I have wondered what the real goals of the Trump administration are regarding their economic policies. I never believed that they want to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, because economic realities cannot be changed that fast (not in months, not even in a couple of years; I think this takes decades if look at the rise of manufacturing in China, for instance).

We are now seeing clearer signs of stagflation (a combination of high inflation, stagnant economic growth, and elevated unemployment) happening in the US. There might be reasons for that outside the government’s control, but their policies don’t help—they make the issues much worse (tariffs, ICE raids on immigrant workers, firing people for political reasons, catering to tech companies to replace people’s jobs with AI).

I understand that making America more economically independent, especially in terms of manufacturing items related to national security (computer chips, pharmaceuticals, military equipment, etc.), is a reasonable goal when you anticipate a conflict/war with China in the future. But if that were your goal, your policies would look much different. You would not put blanket tariffs over the whole world and get rid of all your trading partners and allies all at once. You would do that more strategically and selectively, per industry and country, over a longer period of time.

I also don’t believe that they themselves believe their own narratives, because (apart from Trump and a bunch of other rather dumb people in the administration) there are actually quite a few smart people in this administration who probably know better and should be able to anticipate the effects of their policies. People like Scott Bessent, Peter Navarro, or JD Vance, I believe, can anticipate the consequences (or at least see them now that they are happening) of the policies, but still push them forward. It could be that all these people are just blinded by their conservative groupthink, or are just pleasing Trump until he is gone, or that they are simply profiting from these conditions by being in on the scheme (tariff extraction money flows to Trump and also into their pockets). The last point is probably true, but it would be a dangerous game for them if they did not have bigger plans beyond that. Otherwise, they must fear prosecution after their terms are over.

So, in my mind, the main explanation that is left is that this administration is intentionally inflicting conditions that lead to stagflation in the economy. Now, in a functioning democratic system, heavy ongoing stagflation would lead to public resistance and either the end of such policies or the end of the government. But when you have a government that already has strong autocratic tendencies, stagflation might just perfectly play into their hands. The rising economic hardships can be used to fuel the division of the people and scapegoating toward minorities further. When a lot of people lose their jobs, they are more dependent on the government, which can actively interfere in corporate decisions and provide loyalists with jobs/positions instead of political enemies (look at more stable autocratic countries like Russia, Turkey, Serbia, Hungary, for instance). Intensifying protests are then just another reason to restrict freedoms even more for national emergency reasons. All of this leads to greater centralization of power for the autocratic leadership.

My point is, I believe that the economic policies are intentionally implemented to create stagflation, and in response, transform America into a more stable autocracy. How to change my mind? I guess the main point to argue is the intentionality of it all, but there are probably hundreds of arguments why this is not happening, and I would like to hear them all.",Go_Improvement_4501,1618,166,0.9300000071525574,0.10762451208543516,1757849671,/r/changemyview/comments/1ngoz5g/cmv_the_trump_administration_intentionally_forces/,2025,9
1nmxg59,"CMV: Most people who label themselves ""conservative"" are like the Joker and their goal in life is to prove you're just as bad and rotten as they are, and that you are a hypocrite","I am noticing a pattern among conservatives where they know a viewpoint they hold is objectively bad for society meaning it *will* lead to overall bad outcomes and they know it will, but they still hold on to this viewpoint because it is so deeply ingrained within them, and they feel it is ingrained in others as well, and so they project that back out to the public. They feel everyone else is *virtue signaling* about really not being racist or sexist, and they have a goal to prove you are just as bad as they are 😏

One of their favorite quotes from a few years ago was ""everyone is racist,"" after all. Uh, sir, I am black in the United States of America and while I know some black people are racist, I cannot afford to be and most other black people would agree with me. 

It's like the dynamic between the Joker and The Batman. The Joker is always trying to push The Batman past his limit to show that Batman is just as sick and twisted as the Joker. This is the Joker seeking validation of his own existence, and I think the same can be said for conservatives. 

When people talk about improving society a bit and making life here on earth just a little bit better for humanity, it is always the conservative that says shit like ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions,"" which is usually out of context as that quote applies to ""good intentions"" that are not well-thought out ahead of time, but we are a modern, scientifically-advanced super power, so I think we will be OK with trying to improve things in this society and around the world. 

Anyway, when I am talking to a conservative it is always like talking to the same two or three guys, so at least I know what I am dealing with, but it is so frustrating that we cannot make the world a better place because we have these psychopathic Jokers playing these little, psychological game with all of us to affirm their own existence, and that they are not ""bad"" and how they feel the world should be organized (some weird hierarchy usually) is justified 🤣",BeezusCHrist_,365,555,0.6800000071525574,0.10724640980219374,1758474389,/r/changemyview/comments/1nmxg59/cmv_most_people_who_label_themselves_conservative/,2025,9

1ndt9qw,CMV: Charlie Kirk’s death was orchestrated by the Trump administration.,"So a few things…

1. Charlie Kirk was one of the few right wing podcasters arguing for the release of the Epstein files. Even after having said he was ready to move on he brought it back up claiming essentially the ball was in the admins court and they needed to respond.

Obviously, this isn’t great for Trump and it would be beneficial to silence this dissent. It can’t be done legitimately so more drastic action was needed. 

2. The attempt on Trumps life in PA left a lot of unanswered questions. So many holes and gaps that it makes one wonder if that could have been staged. If that was staged then so too could Kirk’s murder have been arranged. Eerily similar circumstances as well between the Trump assassination attempt and the murder of Kirk.

3. Kirk made it known that he felt certain people committed more acts of gun violence against civilians than any other group. In fact, that was the topic of discussion when Kirk was murdered. Within the last week, WH spokesperson Leavitt said the administration was looking at taking gun rights away from specific people. Kirk’s murder would give the WH justification for going after gun rights of people they don’t like including LQBTQ, minorities, democrats, etc.

1n6scrr,CMV: Blasphemy laws are an abomination and should be internationally banned.,"I believe blasphemy laws are fundamentally incompatible with freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and basic human rights. Today, blasphemy is punishable in more than 60 countries, and in a few — such as Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia — it can even carry the death penalty.

In many cases, these laws are used to silence dissent, target minorities, or settle personal grudges. For example, accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan have led to mob violence, imprisonment, and executions. In countries like Nigeria and Egypt, blasphemy charges have been brought against writers, activists, and even children for things like social media posts.

To me, this is an abuse of law at the deepest level: punishing people not for harming others, but for offending ideas or religious authorities. Protecting religious sensibilities at the expense of human liberty seems backwards.

International human rights frameworks already condemn torture, slavery, and other practices considered incompatible with human dignity. I believe blasphemy laws belong in the same category — they should be abolished everywhere.

CMV: Am I overlooking cultural, legal, or practical reasons why blasphemy laws should remain?

1n8kicn,"CMV: Men and women, broadly speaking, are equally shallow.","I got caught in a small debate between two friends — one male, one female — over what counts as a dad bod. Friend A was making the point that she didn’t need her man to be in super tight shape to find him attractive, she was comfortable with him in his current, “dad bod” form. Friend B, and me, however had seen her husband and vociferously objected that her husband was not “dad bod” material. He was in great, great shape before they had their two kids and since then he gained maybe 15 pounds of fat. 

He was still the benefitting from 8 years of consistent effort in the gym and it showed in his biceps and quads. Friend B said real dad bods aren’t super in-shape men that gained 10 pounds, they’re Homer Simpson lol and that she and most women would aren’t attracted to that. 

The debate then moved onto *what* counts as a dad bod. But for me, it helped crystallize and articulate an idea I’ve had for awhile. 

*Most of the debates about what “women want” are men trying to tell women that they’re just as shallow as men are. They’re just in denial.*

**It’s the inverse of this common situation:** a man or men online say they’re just as attracted to “natural” girls who don’t use a lot of makeup as they are to girls who wear a “full face”. 

**Which is followed by:** women harshly point out that, actually, the natural women they cited are wearing *just* as much makeup and that they’re deluding themselves into thinking they’re more progressive then they actually are. 

Or the often beaten dead horse of “men only treat women like human beings if they can fuck them”. 

Because in their lives they’ve seen how pretty privilege favors some women over their ugly or average sisters. In the same ways, men when they debate “what women want” they’re pointing out that men who *don’t* look like Homer Simpson or have a beer gut tend to do better with women then others.

1nsrzir,CMV: Israel is purposely leaving hamas as an excuse to genocide and drag the palestinian conflict.,"Israel is purposely leaving Hamas alive as an excuse to justify what is really a systematic campaign against Palestinians. They have repeatedly shown they can carry out small tactical strikes with surgical precision, like in Iran, where they don’t need any justification and have done it. With Hamas, they don’t take that approach because they need a reason to escalate. It’s not about eliminating a real threat because they clearly could if they wanted but about keeping the narrative alive that they are “defending themselves” while slowly carrying out a larger plan against the Palestinian population.

This goes beyond military strategy into deliberate political and social manipulation. By keeping Hamas in place, Israel ensures there is always an excuse for attacks that target civilians, infrastructure, and entire communities. Every operation can be framed as retaliation, giving cover for what is effectively a campaign of genocide. Hamas is not a threat they cannot handle, it is a tool they use to legitimize violence while the true goal of controlling, displacing, and devastating Palestinians continues without challenge.",Ragu_Ugar,149,537,0.6000000238418579,0.09354572836726145,1759075219,/r/changemyview/comments/1nsrzir/cmv_israel_is_purposely_leaving_hamas_as_an/,2025,9
1nnjx9f,CMV: The political alignment of the Charlie Kirk assassination does not matter.,"You have the left saying the shooter was right leaning. Then you have the right saying the shooter was left leaning. Then over there is a study showing that the majority of political violence comes from the right and then this study here that says the majority of political violence comes from the left. Guys. THIS DOES NOT MATTER. The political views of the shooter does not matter and here are the two main reasons why.

**1. They do not share the views of the entire political spectrum.**

This is pretty obvious. If the killer is a leftist, that doesn't mean every leftist is suddenly a violent terrorist looking to kill anyone who shares a belief they don't like. If the killer is a rightist, that doesn't mean every rightist is suddenly a violent terrorist looking to kill anyone who shares a belief they don't like. Saying otherwise is entire political posturing. You are trying to demonize a large group of normal people for no reason than politics. 

**2. It sews division where there shouldn't be division.**

Kirk's assassination is horrible. In one day, a man lost his life, a woman lost her husband, two young children lost their father, and many people lost a friend. I didn't care for Charlie Kirk. I didn't agree with much of what came out of his mouth. I didn't believe he was a good debater. I did believe he was a pretty hateful person. But that doesnt stop me for having empathy on what people lost that day, and it shouldn't stop you either. Thats what people should be focusing on right now. The tragedy of it all. Not ""the killer believes this"" or ""no the killer believes that."" But instead ""This was horrible,"" and ""You're right, how do we stop this from happening again.""

At the end of the day, the political ideology of the killer doesn't change anything. It doesn't suddenly mean all leftist or all rightist are violent. And it shouldn't be used to further divide people in an already greatly divided country. Political violence has no place in the United States. If you believe it does, kindly leave. We don't want you here. This of course goes for left and right cause both are doing it across the spectrum. To change my mind on this subject, you'll have to refute my reasoning or provide a good logical argument for why the political views of the killer matter when faced with the negatives I've already mentioned. 

Edit: I've had my mind changed with one reason. That being that its important to know the political ideology of the killer to determine what views cause this kind of violence. I'll still be debating here to see if anyone can bring up more points, though, so if you have anything else, feel free to comment.

1n6laea,CMV: Blind Partisan Loyalty is why America can never find the sweet spot to get things right.,"Addressing both Left and Right-wing here.

To explain ""Blind Loyalty"". Let's compare it to sports betting as a metaphorical analogy. 

The ""Average Sports Fan"" always bets on his team out of emotional attachment, belief, passion, and hatred for the rival team. Based purely on subconscious emotional biases and any positive data they can rationalize, without objective verification or calculation. When they lose, they will always justify it somehow, and do it again next time. Most people are ""Average Sports Fans"" when it comes to politics. 

The ""Professional Sports Better"" bets on the team most likely to win based on data, not on emotions. They look at statistics, analytics, medical records, history, and so on. They will even pay insiders for classified information, hackers for access to private social media accounts, and paparazzi for intrusive personal information. If they have any emotional biases as fans, they have to shut it down for the sake of being as objective as possible.

In any Competition or Conflict of Interest. All parties are incentivized to do whatever it takes to improve and maintain a good image, while tarnishing the others. This means lying, omission, reframing, information warfare tactics. They are incentivized to say the truth ""as is"" only when it benefits them the most. Which is rare, they will always exaggerate or underrate truthful information, if they do release any.

I've been on both sides. But ever since I began investing and learning analytics. I've learned to become neutrally objective. Being bias when you are investing money is guaranteed bankruptcy.

Unlike Sports, the solution isn't two-sided. It's much more complex. All sides could be completely wrong and partially right, or one side can be completely correct. Scientists have the ""Scientific Method"" to figure out who is right. The scientific method teaches you to be agnostic with your initial ""Hypothesis"" & ""Conclusions"" and to suppress biases. Through research, debate, and experimentation, old ideas are changed based on the results. Once the correct Conclusion is proven with undeniable evidence, it will be (usually) universally accepted without doubt. 

Today we have services like Ground News that compile, sort, and summarize data for you. We have free AI chatbots. There are neutral analyst Influencers that package it for you accurately, but they are never as popular as partisan ones. Point, is you don't have to be a Data Scientist or Wall Street Analyst. Yet people still choose to go with what best reinforces their emotional biases.

To give you an example of the ""Sweet Spot"".   
Blanket immunity for police was a source of police brutality and abuse of power. Instead of sensible reforms, we went with ""Defund the Police"" which ended up increasing crime. Now we are back to even more police immunity, and as a consequence of DTP, many police departments are undermanned, so now they are ramping up recruitment and speeding up training. Which means lower quality officers with a lot more power. The sweetspot wasn't Defund the Police. It was more funding for training, higher standards for officers, and more accountability with less immunity. As seen in other countries. Even former DTP and BLM activists have come to this conclusion.

Apply this context to many other issues such as immigration, economics, and etc. We will always struggle to figure it out regardless of the situation with how we think and vote.

Just ask I can give more examples. ",NomadicVikingRonin,227,475,0.6299999952316284,0.08751211298254236,1756823961,/r/changemyview/comments/1n6laea/cmv_blind_partisan_loyalty_is_why_america_can/,2025,9
