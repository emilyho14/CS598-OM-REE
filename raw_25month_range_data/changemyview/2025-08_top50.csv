1mjgc2t,CMV: Israel is committing a genocide,"In this post, I will be using the definition of genocide as posed by the UN, as it is the most widely accepted. Additionally, it is not merely a line in the sand, but one that carries significant legal implications. It asserts that genocide consists of ""any of the following acts committed **with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group**, as such:

* Killing members of the group;
* Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
* Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
* Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
* Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

 \[13\] 

It only takes **one** of these to constitute a genocide, but I think Israel's actions can be described by the first four (as was argued in the ICJ). While the genocidal acts themselves are important, far more important (and harder to prove) is the intent with which they are committed. This will be the focus of my post.

I should note that I will be referencing the ICJ hearing on this genocide many times, and each time I will provide a link to the timestamp, as South Africa’s argument was over 3 hours long

The IDF's destruction of Gaza has been so systematic and total that it can only be explained by an intent to destroy, in part, the population of Gaza based on their being Palestinian. The goal is not simply to overthrow Hamas, but to collectively punish all the people in Gaza through bloodshed. 

As of July 30th, the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 60,000 at least. \[1\] That is 3% of the total population of pre-war Gaza, and it is almost certainly an underestimate. An article in the Lancet published January 10th found that this same estimate was underreported by 41% \[2\]. Of the dead, roughly 51% are women, children, or elderly \[1\].  An additional more than 140,000 have been injured. \[1\]

Around 90% of the population of Gaza has been displaced, fleeing for their lives \[1\], but even those who managed to escape to “safe zones” are targets. In fact, Nir Dinar, spokesperson for the IDF, has said publicly that “there are no safe zones.”\[4\] During the ICJ court hearing, which took place just 97 days into the now nearly 2-year-long conflict, it was stated that Israel had dropped 2,000-pound bombs on designated safe zones at least 200 times. \[5\]

The injured increasingly have nowhere to go, as Israel has targeted hospitals and healthcare facilities time and time again. According to Doctors Without Borders, “Currently, no healthcare facility in Gaza is able to handle the large flow of wounded people.” \[12\] On May 22, the WHO had recorded 697 attacks on health care since the conflict had started. They reported that only 19 of an original 36 hospitals remained operational, and that 94% were damaged or destroyed. “The destruction is systematic.” \[11\] 

Healthcare is far from the only essential service the people of Gaza have been deprived of. 96% of households report moderate to severe water insecurity, and 81% have reported poor food consumption. Household might be an inaccurate term, however, because 92% of housing has either been destroyed or damaged. \[1\] 1 in 5 children is acutely malnourished, and that is likely an underestimate. \[15\] This is consistent with the intentions of Yoav Gallant, who called for a “complete siege of Gaza,” because they are fighting “Human animals”.  \[14\] 

After international outrage, Israel has opened up new corridors for aid in Gaza; before then, there were three routes for aid into Gaza’s (original) 2.1 million people. \[18\] Compounding the issue, these shipments are often successfully blocked or destroyed by far-right “activists.” \[17\] The aid that does get through is severely limited by Israeli restrictions. \[19\] This is after Israel blocked all aid into Gaza for 3 months, despite the ongoing humanitarian crisis. \[22\] The journey to this limited aid is also extremely dangerous; from May 27th to August 1st, at least 1,373 people were killed while attempting to receive food. \[20\] Here is an aid truck arriving in Gaza.\[21\] This was within the first 100 days of the conflict.

As argued in the ICJ, these genocidal acts are “rooted in the belief that in fact the enemy is not just the military wing of Hamas or indeed Hamas generally but is embedded in the fabric of Palestinian life in Gaza.” \[7\] Ruthie Blum, former advisor to Netanyahu, has written that “It’s time to dispel the myth that Gaza is filled with innocent civilians.”\[8\] President Isaac Herzog has stated, “This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it's absolutely not true.” \[10\*\] Itamar Ben-Givir, Minister of Security, has stated, “When we say that Hamas should be destroyed, it also means those who celebrate, those who support, and those who hand out candy. They are all terrorists, and they should also be destroyed.” \[16\] If no one is innocent, what is to be done? Nassim Vaturi, deputy speaker of parliament, has called for “erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the Earth.” \[9\] The goal may be to stop Hamas, but in the minds of many Israeli leaders, all Palestinians in Gaza are Hamas.

The genocidal destruction of a group “in part” is established when the part targeted is “significant enough to have an impact on the group as a whole.” \[23\] It is hard to argue that the mass starvation, bombing, and displacement haven’t resulted in the whole of the Palestinian people being deeply affected. October 7th was horrific, but it doesn’t have to be unprovoked to become genocide. In fact, the UN’s definition makes clear that genocide can occur in the context of armed conflict.  \[13\]  What matters is if all people belonging to a group are being targeted, without discretion for their military importance. Were those fleeing to safe zones or traveling to receive aid of military importance? Hamas may be using human shields, but according to Article 51 of the Geneva Convention, the use of human shields does not release the opposing party of their obligation to avoid civilian casualties. \[24\] 

In the past 670 days, the IDF has systematically annihilated all semblance of a Palestinian society in Gaza. They bomb people's homes and the “safe” zones to which they flee. They destroyed hospitals and cut off the aid that the surviving hospitals desperately need. They have starved the people of Gaza and killed them as they clamor for food. They have repaid the mass deaths on October 7th 50 times over, and there is no end in sight. This is all backed up by the genocidal rhetoric of top Israeli officials, who show no signs of stopping. At a point, the mass deaths of civilians aren’t collateral damage; they’re the intention.

1mfqhe0,"CMV: the strict control over who can post at r/conservative, and the frequency with which they ban people from their sub, proves definitively that conservatives do believe in censorship and do not, in spirit, fully agree with the concept of free speech.","Understand that I am not arguing that r/conservative does not have the right to ban people, and I am not commenting on what I think about them doing so. I support their right to foster that space in their own way and control who has permission to post there. 

That said, if they are to exercise that right, then they DO believe in censorship and do NOT believe totally in ""free speech"". I need to clarify here that I'm aware that true ""free speech"", as bestowed by the first amendment, means not being imprisoned by the government for what you had to say but does not protect you from being, say, banned from a subreddit and doesn't protect you from citizens policing their own conversations. But I think we can at least agree that there's some understanding of a form of ""free speech"" that deals with allowing any and all opinions to be expressed and heard everywhere, across the board, no matter how much other people like those, and I think conservatives are very familiar with this interpretation of ""free speech"".

And so, in their own most important space, since they are exercising their abilities to silence other people and shut down conversations they don't like, they should stop acting like censorship is some awful thing and that they are the true proponents and advocates of free speech.

1msrc8g,CMV: There is literally nothing Trump could do that would make his supporters denounce him.,"MAGA is in some weird psyop where Trump can literally do no wrong ever, and he's getting more and more batshit crazy every day. He has military in American cities with zero cause, and his supporters are cheering it on. No matter how brainwashed MAGA is, it gets to a point. Like, even if I imagined myself being fed Fox News slop from birth, I still see myself questioning what the Trump admin is doing right now. Maybe when their own lives are ruined, then they'll start backtracking, but even then, they'd probably just pretend they never actually supported Trump and latch onto some other far-right figurehead. Right-wing politics right now is literally just hating the left, no matter what that entails. Denying climate change, pretending vaccines don't work, hating minorities, getting rid of regulations that literally keep us alive, shredding the Constitution to pieces and ignoring the law, allowing the President to literally own a memecoin where he takes in bribes as well as drop his own cologne and phone brand, not to mention the pedophilic sex ring, global blanket tariffs, etc. Dozens of videos of ICE literally abusing legal residents on video, but clearly they don't care about any of that. This doesn't even mention the insane shit Trump has already done years ago, such as January 6th. Not sure what else is supposed to be disqualifying for someone to be President if that isn't. All of this because they hate woke culture or something? I can't even fathom the reason. They see a video of some liberal with blue hair and suddenly want America destroyed; it literally makes no sense.

I almost hope it’s manufactured outrage that conservative outlets are harping on the issue after reading a few annoyingly far left tweets.

It seems blatantly obvious to me that he is an indicator of a failing system, one that both major parties have contributed to by selling out to the highest bidder. 

Why was Donald Trump elected? Well, it depends who you ask. But at the core, MAGA is built around the resentment everyday Americans feel about having their future torn away from them. America used to be ""great"", they say. Now sure, there are many ways to strawman MAGA, but there is lots of truth. The cost of living has skyrocketed, healthcare is a luxury, the expansion of the surveillance state impacts everyone, even fear mongering about the ""other"" comes from a place of discomfort living a median life. 

How can anyone look at such consistent US decline and honestly say that the Democrats will rise to the moment? I say it's simple: they won't. The Democrats are not coming to save you. The Democrats will have to win again at some point, but will do nothing to prevent the problems that created MAGA. They will instead sell legislation to the highest bidder.

1mfxy10,CMV: Islamophobia has made it impossible to criticize Islam in a normal & non-bigoted way.,"I’m taking specifically about the West. 

Right wingers want all Muslims to die and leftists don’t accept any kind of critique against Islam in general. You tell someone on the right that you’re not a huge fan of Islam’s apostasy laws and they’ll tell you with a straight face that they’re all terrorists. You tell someone on the left that some of Islam’s laws on warfare (like the one about prisoners of war) are morally questionable, and they’ll try to shift the conversation to Christianity, criticism against which they’ll readily accept and talk at great lengths.

Christianity in the West is a great example of a religion we can now criticize in a normal, rational, un-bigoted way in the West. That’s because there’s hardly such a thing called “Christianophobia” in the West, and thank God. In fact I think Christianity is dissected in the West in such a scientific, anthropological way that I think is so fascinating. I think the way everyone regardless of their religious beliefs (or lack thereof, in the majority of cases) felt comfortable tuning in and talking about this year’s Conclave goes to show how normalized rational, non-bigoted discussion and critique of Christianity is in the West. 

Because of Islamophobia, popular discussion about Islam in the West has only ever fallen under two categories: bigotry or blind defense. 

Obviously Islamophobia has caused a surge in irrational hatred and bigotry from the right against Muslims, that we all know, but an unintended consequence of this that people don’t really talk about is how the Western Left seems to have in many ways either blatantly defended the indefensible or become intolerant towards any critiques against Islam to kind of absorb or “balance” all of the hatred coming from the Right.

This leaves very little space for people to interact or engage with Islam in a normal, rational, non-bigoted, non-biased, and non-censored space. I feel like there exists no “centrist” space for a conversation like this, or maybe it’s just that centrists aren’t loud enough about their opinions on Islam as the right and left (I don’t really know if centrists are really loud enough about anything, coming from a leftist). You’re either fully Islamophobic or don’t think Islam’s problems should be discussed whatsoever. 

Like are there normal people who have normal thoughts about Islam? Like there are some pretty good things in there too. Bad stuff as well. Like can we just be normal? Some nasheeds are genuinely so fire. Maybe let’s not advocate for killing Ex-Muslims though. Is it that hard to have a conversation like this? 

TLDR:
Me: Islamic apostasy laws are kinda crazy I’m ngl
Right wingers: That’s why I don’t have any sympathy for the children in Gaza. Israel should finish the job.

Me: Islam allowing governments to hold prisoners of war for ransom is lowkey insane

1mfz11b,CMV: a man is never wrong for seeking a paternity test for a child presumed to be his,"4% of children born in the United States have legal fathers who incorrectly believe the child is theirs biologically. Not men who weren't sure or who suspected the child may not be theirs, but men who were confident that they were.

4% is 1 in 25. I'm in medical school, and I've learned about congenital conditions that are 1.5 in 1000 in prevalence that are considered common. Every single child born in the United States is tested for a number of conditions at birth that are 1 in 10,000+ in frequency. SCID, which is 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 in incidence, is one of them. No one argues that it's irrational or a waste of money to test for exceedingly rare medical conditions, because we correctly recognize that some conditions, no matter how rare, are serious enough to necessitate universal screening.

From the perspective of a man, how serious is misattributed paternity? How massive of a financial and emotional responsibility is it to be the father of a child?

1 in 25 isn't rare at all. It's extremely common. How do I know? Because **Cystic Fibrosis carrier status is also 1 in 25 in prevalence in European populations, and it's considered very common**. 1 in 25 is many of the people you know. It's many of the people who will read this post. It's 300 million people worldwide. The unfortunate truth is that many men misplace their trust because a lot of people are good at pretending to be trustworthy.

Given the prevalence of misattributed paternity, the fact that we consider it rational to test for things that are far less common, and the massive financial and emotional responsibility a man takes on as the father of a child, I think it's perfectly reasonable for a man to test whether or not he is actually the father of a child if he ever feels inclined to do so.",Wooden_Guest_6911,1014,2348,0.6600000262260437,0.5672289173277316,1754162869,/r/changemyview/comments/1mfz11b/cmv_a_man_is_never_wrong_for_seeking_a_paternity/,2025,8
1mzupsm,CMV: Trump is setting the stage to intentionally start a war with Venezuela or Mexico so he can then claim to be a war time president in an attempt to cancel the 2028 elections.,"Trump's moves in relation to Venezuela and/or Mexico are a misguided attempt to imitate Putin and Netanyahu. 

There have been multiple times that Trump and his followers have floated the idea of Trump being President for a third term. He mentioned the idea during a January 2025 Vegas rally ( [https://youtu.be/OXo-XBvMAUQ?t=2465](https://youtu.be/OXo-XBvMAUQ?t=2465) ). Then again during a Feb. 2025 speech ( [https://youtu.be/Vw2AZK5gEok?t=823](https://youtu.be/Vw2AZK5gEok?t=823) ). In March he said that a lot of people have asked him to run again and that, while he's focused on this term he would like to run again and that there are ways around the 22nd amendment ( [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752) ). Even as recently as Aug. 5th he's said he would like to run again ( [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/05/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-president-donald-trump.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/05/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-president-donald-trump.html) timestamp 35:58) There was even been an attempt to amend the constitution as early as Jan. 2025 by Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn. ( [https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/29](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/29) ) to make is so that a candidate can run and be elected for President up to three times. These are all tests to see how much outrage something like this would cause, how much actual support there would be for Trump continuing as President past 2028, and attempts at normalizing the idea of Trump continuing as President past his second term. Add to all this Trump's 'joke' based on the fact that Ukraine has been unable to hold elections since 2019, “So you say, during the war, you can’t have elections,” Trump responded. “Say, three and a half years from now — so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections. I wonder what the fake news would say about that?” ( [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-live-updates-rcna225477/rcrd86684?canonicalCard=true](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-live-updates-rcna225477/rcrd86684?canonicalCard=true) ) and the actions he's been taking to normalize the use of military force on American soil, like the activation of the National Guard and the Marines in California, the federalization of the DC police force, the activation of the National Guard in DC, and the proposal to send the National Guard into other American cities like Chicago and New York. 

These actions combined make the movement of the USS Gravely, the USS Jason Dunham, and the USS Sampson to the coast of Venezuela, along with his authorization to deploy US troops into Mexico ( [https://youtu.be/povVuY6L6pA](https://youtu.be/povVuY6L6pA) ) to ""fight the cartels"", which could spark a war with Mexico if done without the Mexican President's permission, permission that she has already said multiple time she will never give, seem like the first step in sparking a war with one or both countries as 2028 gets closer in an effort to then use that as an excuse to try and stall or cancel the elections.

Frankly, as a progressive, I find this deeply shitty and I have no interest whatsoever in protecting the people who did that. I don't care how many Ds they have next to their names, and I don't care if it means we lose every election from now until the crack of doom. If it turns out the entire party was in on Epstein's child trafficking operations, I want that information public. 

I don't want to be represented by someone who was a part of that vile group of monsters. And I have not encountered a single Democrat (outside of, possibly, party leaders) who want that. There is a certain level of shittiness we democrat leaning voters will put up with in our representatives, I will not debate that, but someone representing us in government after literally enslaving children to be raped repeatedly by the highest bidder? 

Yeah, that's just way, \*way\* too far beyond the pale. 

But it does seem like at least the republican leadership sees our attempts to get the files released as an attempt to root out their people and protect our own. Which allows them to feel morally justified in protecting their own child predators in party leadership.

They do not seem to understand that we are not interested in protecting our leaders. We know revealing this information might remove key members of our coalition and make our party more disorganized and rudderless. We do not care. 

But I get the sense that a lot of republicans \*think\* we care. Possibly because they don't care how evil \*their\* reps are. Perhaps they and would defend their leadership no matter what horrors they covered up, so they assume the democrats would do the same. To me it seems the most likely explanation.

To change my view, please let me know if republicans like Vance don't actually think democrats are unwilling to purge their own. I could see a world where statements like this are designed to get sound bites for their base to hear on Fox News or something and are pure bluster.   
  
You could also provide me with an alternative explanation for accusations like this showing up.    
  
Or, you could let me know if there is a similar divide between republican leadership and their base. Perhaps we are all in the same boat here and kicking everyone out who rapes children is a point of unity in our divided nation. Frankly, I hope that's true.",chaucer345,2629,314,0.949999988079071,0.5051598763555285,1754886346,/r/changemyview/comments/1mn3jdv/cmv_republicans_do_not_understand_that_the/,2025,8
1n1muai,CMV: Citizens United vs FEC (2010) was the worst Supreme Court decision of the 21st century.,"While cases like Dobbs v. Jackson (which overturned Roe v. Wade) or Shelby County v. Holder (which gutted the Voting Rights Act) get more attention, I believe Citizens United was uniquely destructive because it reshaped the foundation of American democracy itself. In that ruling, the Court held that corporations and unions have a First Amendment right to spend unlimited money on “independent” political expenditures. The practical effect was the rise of Super PACs, the explosion of outside spending, and the flood of “dark money” into elections. The change is staggering: in the 2008 election (before Citizens United), outside spending was about $300 million and dark money was under $5 million. 

By the 2020 cycle, outside spending had skyrocketed to over $3 billion, with more than $1 billion coming from dark money groups that don’t even have to disclose their donors. 

On top of that, in 2008 the top 100 donors accounted for about 15% of all federal election funding, but by 2020 they provided nearly 70%. In other words, a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals and organizations now dominate American political financing.

What makes Citizens United especially harmful is that it entrenched inequality in political power in a way that cuts across every other issue. Whether you care about healthcare, climate change, reproductive rights, or foreign policy, money now plays an outsized role in determining which voices are heard and which policies move forward. Unlike Dobbs, which can theoretically be addressed through legislation at the state or federal level, Citizens United rests on a constitutional interpretation of free speech that is extremely hard to reverse, it would likely require either a constitutional amendment or a dramatic shift in Court philosophy. That makes its damage enduring.

In my view, Citizens United didn’t just change one area of law, it rewired the entire American political system to be more plutocratic. Other rulings may have had immediate and painful effects, but this one undermines democracy at its root by giving disproportionate power to wealth. That’s why I think it deserves the title of “worst Supreme Court decision of the 21st century.” CMV.",Foreign_Cable_9530,2070,801,0.949999988079071,0.49035144697200034,1756314440,/r/changemyview/comments/1n1muai/cmv_citizens_united_vs_fec_2010_was_the_worst/,2025,8
1mxwy23,CMV: Islam is beneficial only for Arabs and a loss for non Arabs,"Look at my POV.

Converting to Islam means following Arab culture and leaving your own culture.

That's what happened to non Arabs.

Iranians left Zoroastrian culture.
Turks left Tengrism culture.
Ancestors of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis left Hindu culture.

To follow Islam, they started following many things from Arab culture and started abandoning many things from their own culture.

All muslims around the world have to pray in Arabic, do greetings in Arabic, many of them non Arabs even want to dress in an Arab way to look more muslim.

It means...When a non Arab converts to Islam, the Arabs gain a lot and non Arabs lose a lot.

A cultural gain for Arabs (non Arabs will follow Arab culture), and a cultural loss for non Arabs (they'll leave their own culture because they'll automatically believe Arab culture is superior).

So when a non Arab fights for Islam, he's indirectly fighting for an Arab culture, not for his own.

As a result, the non Arab convert starts looking a lot like a wannabe Arab.

Why don't people realize this?

1mf55ku,CMV: The fact that the Berlin Wall existed tells you everything you need to know about communism,"I write this as a person who was born in the Soviet Union in 1980 and who has many blood relations who sang to me its praises throughout my childhood. Moreover, I’m not entirely unsympathetic to the idea of communism and I believe that without the brutal and ruthless determination of Stalin’s regime, the liberal democracies would never have defeated Hitler on their own in World War II.

Having said that, all you have to really know about communism as an system of government is that its leaders were compelled to build a wall to prevent their own citizens from fleeing to lands governed by their political rivals. 

And not just in Berlin either, all communist countries required their people to obtain exit visas in order to visit other countries. What does that tell you?

What’s more thousands of people, many of whom were among the most talented and productive members of communist countries, defected to capitalism, while only a handful of people went the other way.

I am not writing this to excuse the crimes and inequities of market based economies, I am just saying that a system of government which prioritizes the abolition of private property and enterprise cannot exist along side countries where the acquisition of wealth and property is limitless. The latter system will always be more attractive to the most creative and ambitious individuals.

1n037ej,CMV: Dems are less likely to associate with Reps because they don’t view politics as a team sport,"So, one thing I think a lot of us have seen since the election is that several Republican voters are complaining about how their Democratic friends have cut them out of their lives. “Oh, how could you let so many years of friendship go to waste over politics?”, they say. And [research has shown](https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/#:~:text=Importantly%2C%20Republicans%20have%20more%20bipartisan%20friendships%20than%20Democrats%20do.%20A%20majority%20%2853%20percent%29%20of%20Republicans%20say%20they%20have%20at%20least%20some%20friends%20who%20are%20Democrats.%20In%20contrast%2C%20less%20than%20one-third%20%2832%20percent%29%20of%20Democrats%20say%20they%20have%20at%20least%20some%20Republican%20friends.) that Reps are more likely to have Dem friends than vice versa. I think the reason for this has to do with how voters in both parties view politics.

For a lot of Republicans, they view it as a team sport. How many of them say that their main goal is to “trigger the libs?” Hell, Trump based his campaign on seeking revenge and retribution for those who’ve “wronged” him, and his base ate it up. Democrats, meanwhile, are much more likely to recognize that politics is not a game. Sure, they have a team sport mentality too, but it’s not solely based on personal grievances, and is rooted in actual policies.

So, if you’re a legal resident/citizen, but you’re skin is not quite white enough, you could be mistakenly deported, or know somebody who may have been, so it makes perfect sense why you’d want nothing to do with those who elected somebody who was open about his plan for mass deportations. And if you’re on Medicaid or other social programs vital for your survival, you’re well within your right to not want to be friends with somebody who voted for Trump, who [already tried to cut those programs](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/12/18260271/trump-medicaid-social-security-medicare-budget-cuts), so they can’t claim ignorance.

I could give more examples, but I think I’ve made my point. Republicans voters largely think that these are just honest disagreements, while Democratic voters are more likely to realize that these are literally life-or-death situations, and that those who do need to government’s assistance to survive are not w political football. That’s my view, so I look forward to reading the responses.",AlexZedKawa02,1193,1490,0.7699999809265137,0.45457021568681644,1756157159,/r/changemyview/comments/1n037ej/cmv_dems_are_less_likely_to_associate_with_reps/,2025,8
1n17v95,CMV: Neither burning the Koran nor so called 'Islamophobic Speech should be illegal acts in the UK (or any other civilised country),"Let me start by getting a couple of silly caveats out of the way. Obviously, anyone burning a copy of the Koran should only be doing it with a copy that they themselves own. Secondly, it must be under safe and controlled circumstances. 

Dousing a Koran in petrol and throwing into someone's home is an act of Arson, and ought to be prosecuted as such.

However, no matter how offensive any individuals find Koran burning, it should not be illegal. In the last year or so one Koran burner did so, uploading the video to Youtube - with the burner holding some kind of personal connection to a victim of the Manchester Arena bombing (an Islamic extremist terror plot), the other was a Kurdish individual, protesting outside the Turkish embassy. Both of these acts appear to be completely legitimate and reasonable acts of protest.

Now, onto Islamophobic speech. On the one hand, I completely agree that 'being a Muslim' should be a protected class. The implications of this are that if someone fires somebody, refuses to serve someone in a restaurant, or denies someone healthcare, on the basis that the person is Muslim, then this act ought to be prosecuted as being unlawfully prejudiced. However, it is at this line that the specific protections for Islam/Muslim people should be drawn. 

Labour Party UK are supposedly drawing up a definition to allow Islamophobia to be a prosecutable offense. Certain things within their working definition are reasonable, and would apply to any other religion or identity grouping (in effect). For instance, levelling specific threats, harassing, or using slurs against Muslims (or any other individual) would already potentially be covered under laws about harassment and abuse. 

There are however various dangerous ideas within this definition, including things like making links between Islam and terror, discussing the historical spread of Islam via war/invasion (Jihad of the Sword), discussing the link between Islam and grooming gangs, discussing the marriage between Islam's prophet and his child bride.

All of the above are matters of fact, historical record and even appear within Islam's holy texts themselves. How can they be banned or proscribed, as matters of fact?

It is one thing to say that it is illegal to be prejudiced, abuse or hurt to an individual Muslim person, but the idea that nothing hurtful, negative or critical can be said about the institution of Islam itself is patently absurd. 

I suppose much of reddit leans on my side on this, with many atheist and free speech advocates already agreeing with my position anyway, but I do wonder if I have missed something here, and there is a reason that Islam needs this level of protection (or perhaps that it is just the first step towards levelling similar definitions for all religions and identity groups)",8NaanJeremy,1527,953,0.800000011920929,0.42227777163547914,1756269862,/r/changemyview/comments/1n17v95/cmv_neither_burning_the_koran_nor_so_called/,2025,8
1mkeeaa,CMV: Boomer’s have compromised America’s future more than any other generation.,"Not trying to start a flame war, but I’ve been thinking about the long-term direction of the US and how much influence the Boomer generation has had on it. Is it fair to say they’ve done more harm than good to the country’s future?

A few things stand out:

1. Economic policy and inequality
From the late 70s onward, many Boomers in power embraced deregulation, tax cuts for the wealthy, and privatization. These choices helped erode the middle class and concentrate wealth at the top.

2. Housing
Boomers bought homes when prices were low, then used zoning laws and NIMBY attitudes to restrict new development. Now younger generations are stuck with sky-high housing costs and no easy path to ownership.

3. Entitlements and debt
Boomers are collecting the biggest benefits from Social Security and Medicare, but the systems weren’t adequately prepared for long-term sustainability. The financial burden is shifting to younger workers.

4. Environmental inaction
Despite early environmental wins, real action on climate change was delayed or avoided. Short-term economic interests often came first, and now younger generations are facing the consequences.

5. Political gridlock
As Boomers took over leadership, trust in institutions fell and partisanship increased. Congress became less effective, and culture wars took center stage instead of policy solutions.

Of course, not all Boomers are responsible. Many pushed for reform, and plenty are just regular people doing their best. But as a generation, they held a lot of power for a long time. Is it fair to say they’ve left the country in worse shape?

1mlv6wc,CMV: The West Would Have Allowed the Holocaust If Nazi Germany Had Limited Territorial Expansion to Poland and Czechoslovakia,"As much as the international community likes to grandstand as if being anti-genocidal is a ""Western value,"" what they are doing now is precisely what they would have done during the years of the Holocaust. I believe that if Nazi Germany had stopped its territorial expansion (lebensraum) at Poland and Czechoslovakia and focused solely on implementing the Holocaust within those territories, the Western world would have largely stood by and allowed it to happen. My view is based on three key historical factors that demonstrate Western indifference to Jewish persecution and genocide in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

# Argument 1: Genocide Was Not a New Concept, Especially Not for Germany

# Historical Evidence (I hope you see a pattern here)

**Herero and Namaqua Genocide (1904-1908)**

* Perpetrated by German colonial forces in German South-West Africa (now Namibia). Estimated 65,000-100,000 Herero and 10,000 Nama people were killed.

**Greek Genocide (1914-1923)**

* Systematic killing of Greek populations in the Ottoman Empire. Estimated 450,000-750,000 Greek civilians were killed. Occurred alongside the Armenian Genocide

**Various Colonial Genocides**

* The murder of Native Americans during the colonization of North America over centuries. California Indian Wars and massacres (1850s-1870s). Tasmanian Aboriginal genocide (1824-1832).

This short list of examples demonstrates that systematic extermination of ethnic and religious groups was not unprecedented before the Holocaust, yet international intervention remained minimal or nonexistent in most cases.

# Argument 2: Western War Exhaustion and Isolationism After WWI

The impact of World War I created a negative desire in many nations to avoid military conflict at almost any cost.

# American Isolationism:

* **Opposition to War**: During the 1930s, the combination of the Great Depression and the memory of tragic losses in World War I contributed to pushing American public opinion and policy toward isolationism. Isolationists advocated non-involvement in European and Asian conflicts and non-entanglement in international politics.

# French Weakness:

* **Political Instability**: France, in particular, was politically weak in this period, experiencing 16 coalition governments through the 1930s.

# Argument 3: Antisemitism in Western Countries

Antisemitism was at extremely high levels throughout the world during the 1930s and early 1940s

# United States:

* **The Polls**: Antisemitism in the United States was also proven in national public opinion polls taken from the mid nineteen thirties to the late nineteen forties.
* **American Antisemitism**: Father Charles Coughlin, a Catholic radio preacher increasingly attacked ""the Jews"" after 1936... Coughlin's newspaper, Social Justice, reached a circulation of 800,000 at its peak in 1937, and his weekly radio program drew between 5 and 12 million listeners in the late 1930s.
* **Opposition**: Just five percent of Americans in 1938 were in favor of ""allowing German, Austrian, and other political refugees to come into the United States.""

# United Kingdom:

* **Barriers**: A law was enacted in the 1930s to ensure that no more than 5% of the total students in a school were Jewish, limiting the rate at which Jewish children could be admitted to state schools.
* **Refugee Hostility**: The press, which was generally not supportive of refugees, incorrectly reported that there were more Jews in Britain than had been in Germany in the summer of 1938.

# Conclusion

The Western world's has never been anti genocide, it would be more honest to say genocide was more of a western value/tradition more than anything. The entry into WWII was motivated by Nazi territorial aggression threatening their own security interests, not by opposition to the Holocaust itself.

We are only living in the future where the Western world is given praise for helping stop the Nazis because the perfect conditions were met for real action to take place. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened if Japan never attacked Japan or Germany never attacked the Soviet Union. 

Look at America and Europe today; look how easily Nazis became mainstream again. No amount of grandstanding should make anyone forget how long nations stood by knowing everything Germany did, or how much work the everyday people had to put in to get their governments to care.

1mu8d6k,CMV: Trump and MAGA have poisoned the political well and America may never recover,"This isn’t a unique take by any means, but I want to have something to hope for so I hope someone goes for it.

Currently, I see a country with 2 parties: one that relentlessly preserves the status quo of a declining empire, trying to maintain stability at all cost while the cracks are spreading. A party that doesn’t have good answers for many of the systemic issues are country is facing - political corruption, declining infrastructure and education, homelessness and drug use epidemic, and of course widening income inequality where the zoomers (me) are saddled with debt while boomers own $1 million + homes that they’ll sell above asking price. This party, like the rest of the countries politics, are captured by older (age 50+) voters that will not suffer the consequences of the issues and policies enacted today. This party also alway chooses to go high, that inaction is better than bad action, and that now is the time for passivity in the face of radicalism- this is the democrat party of 2025.

Then, there’s the opposition party. Opposition to what? To the status quo. So is it opposition to themselves if they win? No contradiction is possible because it was always the dems fault. It is a united front of negativity - motivated by defeating their opposition, the democrats, by any means possible. There are no values, principles, or truth - as long as you are white, Christian and above all: hate the democrats. It is more important to follow the leader, the president, than it is to hold party members accountable to objective reality. Instead, they have made it a daily ritual through their news networks to propagate fake news because although the news is fake, the feelings that they can instill with it is not. Stripping minorities and vulnerable groups of rights more than makes up for the pain and suffering inflicted on one self. This is the GOP in 2025, they would nuke the country themselves if it owned the libs.

And now we see the GOP in complete control of government, rapidly eroding liberal and independents trust in institutions faster than Fox News & Conservative radio were able to erode republican trust over the last 40 years. It feels like the US is approaching the end of the road, that things are in motion that cannot be undone.

It’s hard to believe that even if Trump disappeared tomorrow, that the damage he has wrought on the US by alienating its allies and causing mass instability won’t be felt for centuries. It is so demoralizing as a young person living now, that the world that we grew up in will be safer and happier than the one we will see for the rest of our lives.

So how do we go back? How do we undo the decades of minding poisoning that conservative media has done, separating rationality from tribal group think that has allowed this Orange buffoon to sell out our country to any and everyone who’ll buy a piece?

1mjiznh,CMV: A Christian “grooming gang” scandal in a Muslim majority nation-state would provoke a far more violent reaction from its public then anywhere in the West.,"To be clear, I don’t think this is a problem for Muslims in the West, broadly speaking. But outside the West: in countries like Indonesia, Egypt, Syria, Nigeria and Iraq the response would be much uglier. Because as much as pick-me leftist academics and progressives like to pretend otherwise, majority Muslim countries are far less tolerant of their religious minorities then anywhere in the West. Now add that to the resentment of colonialism and the stagnation of their countries, mix in the ever-present regulation of muslim women’s bodies and sexuality and we get a powder keg. 

What would be liable to light the fuse on that keg? Oh I don’t know, how about a series of stories on the abduction/rape of Muslim girls by western, white Christian men who assumed all Arab women were hot blooded harlots? 

There would be mass protests in the street, the Egyptian version of Fox News would be ranting about how kafirs are trying to steal their women and turn them Christian, which in turn plays into the victim psychology that plagues much of the Muslim world when it comes to the west. The feeling that secular, non-Arab, un-Islamic ideas are leaching into your society and subverting it intentionally. 

This would lead to violence in my opinion because, when you look at the Arab spring for example, it doesn’t take much for Muslim majorities to go after their minorities. In the Arab Spring case in Egypt, it wasn’t even anything their Christians did that caused the explosion of violent attacks against them. It was simple hatred by radicals who had been waiting for an opportunity to strike. Imagine if they’d been accused of what the men in grooming gangs did.

1n4i4ph,CMV: A Palestinian State will likely be a Failed State,"I don’t want to discuss what the morally correct course of action is or what ought to happen according to international law.  
Within the scope of this CMV I solely want to discuss the likelihood of if a Palestinian State would fail soon after independence were it to be made a State today without systemic reforms.

**Problematic leadership policies** – Abbas’ holocaust revisionism and PA stipends to families of terrorists are problematic policies for alleged moderates  
**Economic and infrastructure fragility** – Gaza depends on foreign aid and Israel for all of their essentials while the West Bank is economically intertwined with Israel and would lose jobs and investments if fully independent   
**Authoritarian and factional politics** – Hamas rules Gaza, the PA rules the West Bank, dissent is suppressed, and past conflicts (2007 Hamas–PA split) show violence is a common political tool   
**Corruption and governance weaknesses** – Both governments are widely accused of kleptocracy and mismanagement, undermining trust and state capacity.   
**Societal and human rights challenges** – Women, LGBT, and minorities face poor protections. Children are often taught hostility toward Israel, and public support for armed struggle remains high

I think that a Palestinian state made today will likely become a failed state soon after independence based off of these above factors unless major reforms are made prior to independence.

You can change my view by explaining how the most likely outcome for a Palestinian state is not to be a failed state. Also acceptable is debunking my raised points and explaining how they are either incorrect or irrelevant to my argument.

1mosc4g,CMV: Congress is the reason our country is a complete shitshow.,"Congress does not have term limits. Members serving terms of 15, 20, 30+ years does not benefit “the people”-it benefits their donors and their pockets. There is no logical reason a member who was elected in the 80’s should have the power to vote on bills, create bills, complete investigations, etc. in 2025. Society didn’t even have flip phones when they were elected, and we’re supposed to “trust” that these members have our best interest at heart? I understand sometimes legislation takes a long time to create and pass, but if it takes 5+ years to create and pass ONE bill, how is that efficient? How is anything the people want going to change? 

Every congressional gathering is a pissing match with streams of power spewing in every damn direction- some stronger than others. Most of the time, at least one member throws a temper tantrum that rivals my 3 year old toddler’s. The members gossip, spread rumors, and shit talk like they’re a professional internet troll on 4Chan. 

Now before you all come at me, yes I am well aware a lot of members don’t fall into that stereotype, but do you really think they’re going to go up against the big bad bullies who act that way? Did you stand up to your middle school bully? Probably not. 

Anyway. 

People always jump and blame the current president (I’m talking about in general, not just DJT) for how poorly everything is in our country, but what about the people behind the curtain? The people who actually CREATE the bills? The people who are supposed to be OUR VOICE? The people who ACTUALLY have the power of our country? 

Change my mind. Convince me that ripping off the curtain and revealing the Great Wizards of Congress for who they really are- selfish, power hungry people- wouldn’t benefit our country in a positive way.

1mfu0yn,"CMV: Islam isn't the ""obvious truth""","In every conversation i've seen among muslims, they say that the truth in islam is obvious and incontestable. They always act like every kafir secretly knows that islam is the truth, but kafirs still deny it so that they can commit forbidden acts like :listening to musical instruments, having a conversation with the opposite gender, wearing gold jewellery and traditional clothes (like cheongsam or sarees), investing in financial products that give interest etc.. this isn't even the full extent of it. 

Islam can be easily disproven:

1. The quran says that earth was made before the stars.
2. The quran describes embryology in a scientifically inaccurate way.
3. The quran says that semen originates in the spine.
4. The quran says that the sun revolves around the earth.
5. Jannat is an everlasting оrgу with 72 virgins for all men, including those who died as kids. What's interesting is that these virgins have regenerating hymens, and skin so pale that you can see their bone marrow. A real god won't make the ultimate reward so hedonistic and pоrnоgrарhic. If you search up the full description of houris, it's an absurdly hilarious list of fetishes. 
6. Quran rejects the science of evolution. You have to watch [this](https://youtu.be/lqk3TKuGNBA?si=gGP2ZQRRKJ-zJweN) 7 minute video before you try to debate this. Evolution isn't a theory, it's an observable fact. Both micro and macro evolution have been repeatedly observed and documented by scientists. Evolution ""by natural selection"", ""by genetic drift"", ""by sexual selection"" are what's labelled __theories__ , as they provide the explanatory framework around the fact of evolution. NASA defines life as ""a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution"". A lot of muslims try to rationalize this by saying that ""i believe in evolution of animals, but not humans"". Honey, humans are also animals. Humans are mammals, and mammals are animals.
7. Mohammed was a PDFile who married a 6 year old. A real god would want his army of believers to protect the innocence of children. Muslims believe that the age of accountability is 15 but the age of marriage can be 6? Excuse me what? 

You need an insane amount of mental gymnastics, blind faith, glorification of suffering, and zero inherent sense of morality to believe in islam. You need to import your morality from a 7th century book, be in denial of science, motivated by the lust for imaginary virgins. This is far from what you can reasonably call ""the objective truth"". This is why apostasy is punished with death in sharia law (according to all 4 sunni maddhabs), because they need to shield themselves from criticism of ex-muslims to avoid their logic from falling apart.

1msci03,CMV: Putting low price limits on death row inmates' last meals defeats the point of offering one.,"So when someone is scheduled to be executed, they're usually given a last meal consisting of whatever they request. Unsurprisingly, this is often things like seafood, steak, or other expensive meals. 

I'm largely talking about the US here (I don't know other countries' death penalty laws/traditions), but several states have imposed restrictions on this last meal, with some states doing away with it completely, and some imposing limits as low as $20-$25. 

Practically, I understand the reason for imposing some restrictions, (such as food that can be purchased locally and reasonable substitutions if the specific food the inmate requested isn't available, or even a significantly higher price limit) but if you're going to offer someone the kindness of a last meal, limiting them to such an incredibly low price means that there's a high chance they won't be able to get what they want. You can barely order a meal from a fast food place that comes to less than $20, much less a real meal. (Especially if you live in a place with sales tax.)

So I don’t wanna hear the I’m racist nonsense meant to shut down a conversation rather than engage in it

I absolutely despise this proud to be ghetto, unashamedly ratchet in public, Idgaf attitude in today’s culture that, unfortunately from what I see, seems to be widespread in black communities.

People will say it’s a poverty issue. I’m sorry, I flat out reject that. You don’t need money to act in a respectful manner.

Whenever I bring this up I just get with “you’re racist”… meanwhile I’m absolutely infatuated and have  tremendous respect for Jim Crow era black America. The fact that they endured so much injustice while remaining godly, intact family units, well educated, and contributed so much to the arts ( fuck yeah blues music), it just makes me sad to see what is happening the last few decades

 I personally blame the media and the glorification of hustle rappers glorifying the lifestyle. That’s who they are shown, that’s the role model image for too many and parents are failing these kids by either taking part in themselves or not doing enough to curb it

1mlsx0d,CMV: Hamas made a mistake in carrying out the 7th Oct attacks and it made the lives of Palestinian people worse,"Hi,
The 7th Oct attacks were terror attacks carried out by Hamas. They were evil from any moral standpoint. I am arguing here that they were a mistake as a “fight back” from a “resistance movement”. If Hamas hadn’t carried out the attacks the lives of the Palestinian people would have been better. I think so because:

1. It gave Israel reason and cover to attack and kill innocent civilians. Many people who otherwise would have condemned Israel were conflicted due to the attacks by Hamas. It made Palestine lose the narrative a bit.

2. It made Hamas a terror organisation. Before the attacks some people, including me, would have classified Hamas as a freedom movement but these horrific attacks solidified their status as a terror group. The way they carried out those inhumane attacks is no way to fight oppression.

3. It gave pro-Israel people a great talking point and something they can always pull of their pocket in arguments. 

4. The parading and celebration of dead people in the streets of Palestine was a really bad look for the people there. It made them looks like monsters.

I am not arguing anything about the attacks so please refrain from using the “how else can oppressed people fight” argument. I am saying that as a way of fighting oppression, this was a really stupid idea and did a lot more harm than good to Palestine.",aloo-ka-paratha,296,1189,0.5899999737739563,0.2497936187659508,1754755145,/r/changemyview/comments/1mlsx0d/cmv_hamas_made_a_mistake_in_carrying_out_the_7th/,2025,8
1mzwbxo,CMV: It is awkward to not know the language of a country you lived in for 4 decades,"Basically, im not trying to insult or hurt anyone but this is genuinely what I feel about my parents and I wished someone could convince me that Im wrong. My mom first came here (a country in the middle east) when she was a teen, and my dad came when he was in his 20's. They were here for 40 consecutive years and they still make the silliest mistakes in the language. I get that Arabic is very hard and Im not expecting them to be fluent, but it is embarrassing how they prefer to talk like how the foreigns talk in here (broken Arabic) even though they can speak better than that, they are just afraid of making mistakes. I try to correct them kindly but they don't like to correct themselves. They like to make others think we dont speak Arabic so that they don't talk to us in an advanced level of Arabic. I speak fluently, and some of my siblings speak fluently. But my older siblings are just like parents, even though they were born here. I don't understand why they are all bad in Arabic. 

  
When I try to teach them indirectly (by talking to them only in Arabic at home), I get tired. Because I have to translate and explain everything. My dad is very interested in improving his English (he is not fluent but trying is good), and I wonder why doesn't he do the same for Arabic. 

  
I understand that learning a whole new language at such age is not easy. If I went to a foreign country now, I wouldn't be able to speak like the locals ever. But the embarrassing part is having the foundation (writing and basic vocabulary and reading) and hearing and reading the language for 40 years and still speaking poorly.

I swear I saw so many foreigns that spoke Arabic much better than my parents and they had known Arabic for less than 2 years. Obviously I never told my parents I feel this way about them but I wished they would change and put an effort into learning.

Their political system is seriously  outdated and flawed. You don't have proportional voting like every other developed country. Voting is skewed by the electoral college and gerrymandering. There's only 2 parties. Representatives are allowed to own stocks. There's probably a lot more I didn't mention. The system is too difficult to reform peacefully.

The population is polarised. And there's concentration of power and wealth.

These flaws were showing themselves 100-200 years ago. The civil war. The gilded age and the great depression. The new deal and ww2 brought temporary relief but they didn't resolve the deeper structural issues.

The day to day life of most people is probably fine. The economy is still going and they have a serious lead in sectors like tech. They will elect another Biden or Obama that's okay but nothing will fundamentally change. The government is not stable anymore.

1mlz88o,"CMV: Democrats don’t win because their message is unclear, inconsistent, and overly conciliatory.","Point 1: Their message is unclear. 

I don’t vote Republican, but I understand what they’re trying to sell me. Talking points like “the wall,” “no more pointless wars,” and “lower taxes for the middle class” are spoken on repeat in terms that everyone can understand. Even if these promises are lies, they are completely unambiguous. It’s kind of to his advantage that Donald Trump speaks like a 12 year old because ordinary people are able to understand him. I’ve watched some NYC street interviews about the upcoming mayoral election, and it’s clear that voters are uninformed and don’t have a firm grasp on the issues. 

On the other hand, Democrats talk about a hodgepodge of different issues and seem to highlight the least concrete of them. In the last campaign, the issues that seemed to be discussed the most were abortion and democracy. The end of democracy, though plausible, feels like a distant reality for a lot of people. Abortion isn’t an aspect of life that most people experience every day. They hear about wars in the Middle East, feel the burden of rising prices, and experience the challenges that our broken immigration system has brought every day. 

Point 2: Their message is inconsistent. 

The reason why I think that the message is inscrutable is because of inconsistencies in what the party values. For Republicans, they’ll fall in line eventually, even if they’re not jn 100% agreement with the candidate. For Democrats, every issue is a dealbreaker for somebody. Not pro-Palestine? Stay home. Not pro-universal healthcare? Stay home. Not anti gun? Stay home. And in terms of leadership, we have seen Democrats try to sabotage people like Bernie, AOC, and Mamdami. There a very few issues that can be confidently raised to the forefront because there is so much irreconcilable division within the party. 

Point 3: Their message is overly conciliatory. 

The message becomes unclear because of Democrats’ need to be conciliatory in addressing inconsistencies in opinion. As an example, some voters really care about culture war issues. Some care more about other issues. But to placate those whose dealbreaker is culture war issues, the Democrats either (a) vaguely take stances or (b) don’t take stances at all. In simple terms, they don’t want to offend anyone, so they usually don’t take resolute stances on issues. 

There are a multitude of other reasons why Democrats don’t win, but I think these are the major reasons why voters are not responding.

1n17ywx,CMV: Democrats absolutely should remain open to a female presidential candidate in 2028,"Let’s say an absolutely *garbage* movie is a box office failure. Audience reviews reveal what they were critical about: “horribly written”; “an action movie without action”; “grade-school level special effects”; “The final scene was literally 5 minutes of one guy eating cereal…” 

And the movie directors respond to this bad reception with one conclusion: “Clearly, the movie failed because we hired a black actor as the lead role.” This producer continues with, “It is a shame that the world is still so racist that they cannot just appreciate a good movie for what it is”. And they finish their response with “I have now learned my lesson: *I will never again hire another black actor in my films*. I am here to make money and cannot risk another failure like this one.”

Rather than to *listen* to the audience who shared insightful criticisms, rather than to consider what they themselves could have done differently to improve upon this project, they find a scapegoat to hold as responsible for their mess. Yes, racism indeed exists and surely someone out there is angry about the black man. However, from numerous accounts, this film failed in many different regards that are entirely unrelated to the race of that actor. The director gets a pass from others like them for “being progressive” and “informing” about the racism that black actors face in this industry… whilst simultaneously making a *non-progressive* promise to *exclude* them from future films.

This is a close analogy to what many democrats online are doing now as they declare that they will *""no longer support a female""* democratic candidate for any upcoming presidential elections. These claims that the world is “just not ready for a woman” are based on a sample size of just *two*. Hilary Clinton actually won the popular vote, refuting this claim that “the nation is just not ready”. Kamala Harris was haphazardly thrown into an *already* impossible position for the democrats who had hopelessly anticipated a loss prior to her candidacy. It is an absolute cop out to attribute her loss to her sex. Without question, these two women could have played their cards differently and had better results. Trump (unfortunately) made the right moves in appealing to a struggling nation. He acknowledged that America was faltering and that the people were struggling (whereas Kamala, in an off-putting move, told the people that they were just wrong). And he promised to put Americans first. **Obviously, he was lying**, but he knew this was what they needed to hear. Kamala's chances were not great and she did not use the little time that she had effectively.

We have an early front-runner for the 2028 election in Gavin Newsom. Democrats have claimed, as above, that they refuse to stand behind someone as high risk as a woman. Yet, there are few that could be higher risk than Gavin. This backing suggests that democrats are not truly opposed to taking a risk with the upcoming election. For years, Newsom has been declared a corporate shill, as fake a politician as one can get, a hypocrite during covid, and disliked for not getting things done with an insane amount of CA taxpayer money. He invited and allowed a space for far-right extremists to talk on his show just months before now acting as though he has no tolerance for their BS. Even if he is taking the lead now with redistricting efforts, he has going against him the California wildfires, hoards of drug addicts/mentally unwell camping out all over the streets, theft up to $950 as security/police were not allowed to step in, and a ridiculously high cost of living with outdated, 2bd California homes now selling for $2 million in any of our halfway decent areas. He will never win a nation that has for years said they do not want to be like “Gavin’s California”. Meanwhile, we have an excellent option in Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan who is loved by her people, who is more personable than Hillary and Kamala (and Gavin), who is said to have fulfilled her campaign promises, who manages a swing state, who is not overly progressive (which is needed right now) and is well-capable of bringing back moderate/swing voters….and the only argument I've heard against her is that *she is a woman*.",srsh32,135,1090,0.5699999928474426,0.20551804914453134,1756270193,/r/changemyview/comments/1n17ywx/cmv_democrats_absolutely_should_remain_open_to_a/,2025,8

1menkvy,CMV: Liberal puritanism did not cause American conservativism to turn radical,"This view is hard to articulate precisely in a rigorous manner, so have patience.

What do I mean by liberal puritanism? It is behavior by liberals that tries to socially ostracize people for wrong thought or political incorrectness. Now, I do think that some things are extreme and deserve social ostracism (and I try to be charitably lenient while relying like everyone else on a ""I know it when I see it"" test), but this argument reasonably assumes that people accept that liberals tend to go overboard on political correctness.

What do I mean by American conservatism turning extreme? Essentially, everything Trump amplified. The racism, dehumanization of people who are different, anti-intellectualism, the moral nihilism, conspiracy theories. 

I argue thusly, liberal puritanism justifiably cause people to become disillusioned with liberal puritanism, but if American conservatives became radical, then they were forced into becoming this, but chose thusly.


I think it turned extreme because all of the flaws of American conservativism were pre-existing and already present, but turned up to 11 because irs followers willingly chose to give in to their worst natures.

I'll give an example. Liberal woke policing is annoying and I can understand why it makes people opposed political correctness. But if people use wokeness as an excuse to become racist and White nationalist, which I see in enough conservatives to concern me, then it was not wokeness that cause people to become racist. People just chose to be.

Another example: Institutions such as academia and the federal government workforce become dominated liberals may cause conservatives to distrust the claims that come out of those institutions. But a powerful part of the conservative base chose to rather than was forced to turn to conspiracy theories.

1mj4kq1,"CMV: As a society, we are too accepting of obesity","Most people know that being obese is unhealthy, and societal norms do pressure people to aim for a healthy bodyweight, to some extent. But I’m of the opinion that this pressure is misguided, misinterpreted, and unassertive.

* 1) Obesity should be tackled as a global health crisis, rather than a deviation from beauty standards

In 2022, 2.5 billion people (31%) worldwide were classified as overweight, 890 million (11%) of which were Obese. These numbers are increasing at faster rates than ever. By 2035, it is estimated obesity will reach over $4.3tn in annual costs to healthcare, around 3% of the global GDP (World Obesity Federation). Even today, Obesity costs the US around $170 billion annually, and the UK’s tax funded health care system around £6.5 billion annually. These are considerable drains to funding, but what if we look at only human aspects, rather than financial aspects?

* 2) Obesity kills and can never be healthy, no matter how much ‘exercise’ someone does.

Obesity is a MAJOR risk factor for long term diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Being obese puts a stress on your body that cannot be alleviated by working out, or eating salads. Sure, those things would help - but it’s incomparable to the effect of becoming a healthy bodyweight. There are those who push for body positive messages, and say that ‘being skinny doesn’t mean you’re healthy’. That is true, but being obese means you’re DEFINITELY not healthy. You only get one body in this life, so why take a gamble and risk your life?

* 3) The current state of (mainly western) society is sending the wrong messages to people.

We should all encourage self-love, self-confidence, and happiness. All of those things are possible to encourage while also promoting healthy living. We should love our bodies - if we do, surely we should treat it well and try and be around for as long as possible? The message to promote healthy body standards must be done without reference to beauty, but rather the health issues I stated above. People may not want to hear it, but medical education and positive lifestyle changes are far more beneficial to encourage than aimless reassurance that ‘we’re all perfect how we are’. People want to avoid stepping on someone’s toes, and instead give them the short-term gratification of body positive messages. We can, and should, do better.

1mlz2nm,CMV: Most companies could pay their workers higher wages like Costco does but they simply choose not tom,"People often say higher wages aren’t realistic for most businesses and I don’t buy it. Costco proves it's possible. They start people off at a higher wage, give them benefits, and the place still makes money hand over fist. 

People say other businesses can't because they have a different model than Costco does. Okay... and? They are free to change their model, they just choose not to.

Defending other businesses for not paying better wages is a bad argument because those companies are absolutely free to structure their company however they want. 

Note - An argument of ""well they serve a lower income population who can't pay membership benefits"" isn't valid here. The business is *choosing* to serve that population. They're not forced to.

1mg1egx,"CMV: sabrina carpenter is not for the ""girls and the gays"", and her marketing is largely based around men.","okay, hi! the controversy around sabrina carpenter's new album cover inspired me to make this post, and i'll mostly be talking about the sudden switch in her marketing/brand since Nonsense. i'd like to start of by saying that you can argue whether being male centred is good or not, but that's not exactly my point, my point is merely proving that her brand IS male centred, and not for the ""girls and the gays"".

Wikipedia defines the male gaze as the act of depicting women and the world in the visual arts and in literature from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as sexual objects for the pleasure of the heterosexual male viewer.   
  
1. The nonsense outros: all are about men. all of them. all of them are oversexualised. they centre men. it's sexual humour, but all of it centres men. how big he is, et cetera et cetera. moreover, the sexualise outros aren't empowering or subversive either. they're marketable, specifically to the men that she is singing to. it's not empowering because there's less about her sexuality as it is, and more about how her sexuality profits men. which imo makes it obvious that the nonsense outros specifically are male centred. 

  
2. the man's best friend cover (original): while she is the centre of the cover, i'd like to argue that she is the centre of the cover in a voyeuristic way. once again, it's a man's action that is highlighted, i.e, the pulling of her hair. her action, kneeling, is AGAIN in service to the man's action. the title compares her to a dog, direct objectification. how is that not male gazey? 

\-the inside of the vinyl, side A (if i'm not wrong): is once again, her being displayed for a man, she's on a bed, her hands holding the headboard (passive), while a man touches her leg. once again, it's sexualised, but it's not for a woman's pleasure, it's the man who is controlling the situation.



3. Manchild: the only single that's been released off of the album, is once again talking about a man who's problematic, and once again features her centring her life around such problematic men. ""i swear they choose me, i'm not choosing them"" even as a joke, is her being passive. 

  
4. the tracklist for man's best friend: 

1. Tears
2. My Man On Willpower 
3. Sugar Talking
4. We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night
5. Nobody’s Son
6. Never Getting Laid
7. When Did You Get Hot?
8. Go Go Juice
9. Don’t Worry I’ll Make You Worry
10. House Tour
11. Goodbye

and 6 of these titles are very obviously about men, even though they're not released. 

  
5. the short and sweet tracklist: 

1. Taste
2. Please Please Please
3. Good Graces
4. Sharpest Tool
5. Coincidence
6. Bed Chem
7. Espresso
8. Dumb & Poetic
9. Slim Pickins
10. Juno
11. Lie To Girls
12. Don’t Smile

11/12 of these are about men. if we argue espresso isn't about men, that makes it 10/12 songs.

these are all the points i could think off the top of my head. i don't see how someone could look at these examples and then claim that her marketing is for the ""girls and the gays"", just because she had one video where she was depicted as having no outfits for men, and an outfit for the girls and the gays. thank you for reading if you did!

1mfl5fb,"cmv: I want Trump to go down as much if not more than the next guy, but I feel like the Epstein files, if released in full and uncensored, still wouldn’t be enough to bring him down.","So let’s say the files release and (as could be expected) he’s all over them. Let’s say there’s a full on 4k video of him doing horrible deplorable things.

So apart from transparency and confirming what we already know, what exactly does releasing the Epstein files do for us?

1n3gl1x,CMV: Implying that a man is gay just because he doesn't find some women attractive is homophobia disguised as trolling.,"A ridiculous trend you see on social media: A man says that he doesn't find a certain woman celebrity attractive. Apparently, this triggers many women (and some men) so much that they feel the need to tell him he ""must be gay"". This is condescension and he implication is that gay men aren't 'man enough' to like women. And these kinds of comments often come from otherwise left-leaning 'allies'. 

So to qualify as a straight man, you are supposed to find every woman attractive ? Are straight women attracted to all men ? If not, do they get told ""they must be lesbian"" ? 

This is a combination of toxic feminism, homophobia and sexism that needs to be unpacked. You do not have to feel offended on the behalf of person B just because a random person C doesn't find them attractive. People are allowed to have preferences. Just because you disagree with them, doesn't mean you get to question their sexuality..

1mpjmow,"CMV: The ""recycling is a scam"" narrative is a harmful faux-progressive American myth","There is a very popular narrative in the US nowadays that ""recycling is a scam/myth/fake"", which is promoted by citing that plastic recycling is uneconomical and that companies are actually to blame for waste rather than consumers. This is all only partly-true and lacking important context.    
  
The most obvious problem with this narrative is it usually conflates plastic recycling with recycling as a whole. Even if plastic recycling were entirely not worth doing, recycling of cardboard/paper, glass, and metal are all much more efficient and sustainable. Some of you might argue that most people don't actually conflate the two and are just talking about plastic recycling specifically, but if necessary I can cite many, MANY, hit tweets where people conflate the two. I would go as far as to say that most people who reference this topic make no distinction.

Next, the notion that recycling is not worth doing because most ends up in landfill anyway also has a number of problems with it. One is that it assumes the majority of recycled waste needs to be effectively recycled in order to make the practice of recycling worth doing at all, but the bigger problem is that it's not universally true and instead reflects an Americentric frame of reference that is used to make a broad statement about recycling as a whole without making any effort to discern *why* the \[American\] recycling sorting process is so inefficient. Most other developed countries actually have significantly higher recycling rates than the US. Most other developed countries have multiple different recycling bins for different types of recyclable waste, but this is too much for Americans so they mostly just use single-stream recycling where all the different types are mixed together then sorted later at the recycling plant. This is obviously much less efficient, but what makes it so much worse is that even with the most simplified system possible the average American still can't be bother to put any effort into sorting their waste. Almost any time I see a public trash and recycling bins next to each other I will look inside to see almost no distinction between their contents. The janitor at a school my friend used to work at would just throw all the school's recycling in the dumpster for no reason other than that he was too lazy to keep them separate. Americans who move to foreign countries like Japan often experience culture shock over how much more complicated their personal waste sorting is and how much personal responsibility they are expected to take for it. The uncomfortable truth is this: American recycling being inefficient is not primarily a systemic problem, but a cultural problem tied to American hyper-individualism. When people promote the ""recycling is a scam"" narrative they just make the problem worse by giving people justification to reinforce negligent practices.

Inb4 I know some of you are going to bring up that consumer product companies have promoted recycling in an attempt to shift blame for waste onto consumers, but that does nothing to refute the viability of recycling as a practice. We can regulate corporations while also practicing socially responsible waste management, it's not a binary.",Xiphactinus14,685,262,0.8100000023841858,0.1617534803799626,1755126172,/r/changemyview/comments/1mpjmow/cmv_the_recycling_is_a_scam_narrative_is_a/,2025,8
1mlzke2,cmv: The electoral college makes voters feel unheard and should be abolished,"Voters in States that consistently vote the other way have ZERO say in who our POTUS will be, which is profundly undemocratic. I don't have exact numbers, but 36 states are considered deep blue/red.

Dems in Texas and Republicans in Illinois may as well not go voting. Is that really the way the US should work? The electoral college was invented to compromise with wary states from joining the US. This purpose has now been served and we can get rid of it, as it majorly disrupts the democratic flow of the country and we don't have to appease slave owning elites anymore.

Regardless of where you stand politically, this should concern every US citizen.

1mzgu24,"CMV: Western culture is quickly moving away from the things that made it successful and desirable, largely due to a culture of effective self-censorship and social punishment for expressions of observed reality","And the decline isn't driven by politics or formal laws, but the social cost of saying or doing things.

I was not born in a western country. When growing up, I always learned that the success of America in business, economy and research is largely due to their freedom of speech and ability to call things as they are without censorship. We were really jealous of that, and America in particular was seen as a dream place to be. 

Now, how the tides have turned. I think the predominantly experience when meeting Americans is that of frustration in them, and noticing how their private beliefs don't match public speech. We see them self-censor because they fear consequences at work or socially. That mismatch makes society feel ""fake,"" and erodes trust in western institutions and political leadership.

We went from non-westerners idealizing the western culture, to mocking it when seeing Americans punished for words, or institutions bending over backward to appear ""inclusive"". It looks weak, hypocritical, or even comical. Meanwhile, rising powers (China, India, the Middle East etc.) use that perception gap to strengthen their own image of ""realism"" and strength. That's the opposite of what used to happen!

People abroad watch in disbelief as America cancels yet another of its own globally successful citizen for something they privately said, as we see misguided attempts at favoring certain races or genders over others despite the latter being the more promising candidates, or see this enormous gap between what people believe and what they seem to be allowed to say. That creates an enormous incongruence, division, and entirely tears down the political leadership. I suspect a large number of people voted in the personification of their loudest screams they are forced to keep locked down just because he said it out loud, despite the tons of stupid things he also says later, and it being one of the underlying reasons why the US politics is in shambles.

Because the pressure for each individual to stay silent if they don't agree with the predominantly pushed belief system tends to push most further away from actually playing along. We noticed this time and time again in countries that abolished authoritarian leadership. The more you try to silence people, the more they tend to fight back towards the other extreme, rather than a reasonable middle.

In the meantime, that tension and incongruence is what creates the appearance of hypocrisy or ""weakness"" abroad. It's as if the beliefs got louder, but what you are allowed to publicly say is becoming the polar opposite of it. It creates an image of an incongruent, fake culture, destroying the reputation of the west which now appears ""weak"" compared to the other quickly growing nations that learned to be more direct and found strenght to call things as they are - the things that they learned made western cultures great at creating research more grounded in reality, and subsequently superior products in the past. And people able to express themselves freely regardless of their beliefs. As that happened elsewhere, western culture has been moving further away from the values that they correctly identified as correlating with technological, educational, and economic progress.",PastaPandaSimon,295,644,0.5699999928474426,0.15848431871159144,1756095384,/r/changemyview/comments/1mzgu24/cmv_western_culture_is_quickly_moving_away_from/,2025,8

Bush: Drives the economy toward recession in a continuation of Reagan-era policy.
