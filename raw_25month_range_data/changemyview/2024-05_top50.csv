1cywsmg,"CMV: otherwise apolitical student groups should not be demanding political ""purity tests"" to participate in basic sports/clubs","This is in response to a recent trend on several college campuses where student groups with no political affiliation or mission (intramural sports, boardgame clubs, fraternities/sororities, etc.) are demanding ""Litmus Tests"" from their Jewish classmates regarding their opinions on the Israel/Gaza conflict.

This is unacceptable.

Excluding someone from an unrelated group for the mere suspicion that they disagree with you politically is blatant discrimination.

1cwq65v,CMV: it is perfectly reasonable of the ICC prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for leaders of Hamas *and* of Israel for alleged crimes against humanity,"I’m feeling like the world has gone mad in its general reaction to this move by the ICC prosecutor.

We have Biden and others calling it outrageous to suggest equivalence between Israel and Hamas (which it would be) but that’s not at all what the ICC prosecutor has done - he’s just said ‘name’ is suspected of this list of bad things, and ‘name’ is suspected of this other list of bad things, with evidence, and those allegations are serious enough that there is potentially a case to answer. 

I’ve also seen people on Israeli subs saying although they might hate Netanyahu, the ICC has lost the plot. Like: ‘he’s a criminal but obviously not THAT kind of criminal!’, and saying the ICC should turn its attention to the real crims in Russia or North Korea instead. But, jurisdictional issues aside, why would you not want scrutiny of all leaders responsible for massive loss of life? Even the strongest supporter of Israel’s right to defend itself should surely be concerned about how exactly that defending is done? And there are lots of features of Israel’s warfare that should at least prompt cause for concern (disproportionate fatalities, friendly fire, dead aid workers, soldier misconduct)

Meanwhile Hamas says the move equates victim with executioner. Same point applies as above, that leaders on both sides might have some charges in common, but the question in each case is “did this person do this stuff?” NOT “is this person better/worse than that person?” Also I don’t believe there is any doubt that Hamas ordered deliberate killing of civilians and taking of hostages. The whole point of the concept of war crimes is that it doesn’t matter how righteous or justified you feel, or how nasty war is - you should never do them. 

Are we really so addicted to “good guy vs bad guy” narratives that we can’t bend our minds around the concept that maybe two sides, despite all sorts of legitimate grievances, can simultaneously inflict great evils on one another?

Is it perhaps that it’s such a complex situation the moderates stay quiet so the polar extremes dominate the airtime?

Or am I missing something here? I see no sensible reason for calling the ICC’s (very preliminary) move anything other than reasonable, or anything short of exactly what we should want to see in modern civilisation.

1clrqw2,CMV: future of Islamism in Europe is not promising ,"
I'm ex-muslim and I was worried about what's happening in the last few years where people in the UK chanting for implementing Sharia as well as Germany 

I don't have problems with Muslims just if you want to say I'm islamophobic but I don't want my head to be chopped off because I left my faith for the scientific errors in the Quran which is the word of God 

But I truly believe that stoning to death, killing apostates, cutting hands and doing jihad which is militarily fighting other countries to worship allah and enslaving their women and children and kill men if they defend their land and implementing jyzia to humiliate non-muslims is something bad and inhumane and terrorist 

I think that 1 scenario will happen in the future out of 2 

1. The good scenario 

Europe will organize the immigration policy and the next generations of Muslim will be less conservative and many of them will leave the faith and everything is gonna be fine (most of the ones who want sharia are either 1st generation or 2nd at most) a


2. The bad scenario 

UK will face a civil war from people who wants to implement the Sharia (and yes that's what literally in the Quran, Muslims are ordered to jihad) and eventually the UK will win but after many casualties 


Sorry if that's sounds very extreme but I'm genuinely worried because I'll encounter many persecution if people in my country knows that I'm atheist and maybe I'll be killed if they know and I'm willing to go work in the west and I -for obvious reasons- don't want to be killed there too

And it features pretty well developed press freedoms, an independent judiciary, full equal protection for all citizens under the law, enforcement of property rights, transparency and accountability of government officials, elections of legislators, robust political debates , etc. These are all hallmarks of a democracy.

1cktjcg,"CMV: If Israel is an illegitimate state because it was founded on ethnic cleansing, so is Turkey.","In 1948 Israel won its war of independence as a product of Arab states refusing the UN partition plan of Mandatory Palestine and then proceeding to not make any sort of counter-offer during this period. 700,000 Arabs either fled Mandatory Palestine or were expelled. 

In the Palestinian narrative, this is seen as the ""Nakba"". They conveniently ignore the significantly larger number of Jews who were expelled from Middle Eastern countries immediately after this.

Regardless, let's say that this narrative is entirely correct. That Israel is an illegitimate state because of their acts of ethnic cleansing justified through Jewish nationalism. Then it should also logically follow that Turkey is an entirely illegitimate state.

Turkey emerged from the remnants of the Ottoman Empire after the Turkish War of Independence (1919-1923). The establishment of Turkey happened as the result of significantly worse levels of ethnic cleansing and genocides against ethnic minorities. The most obvious example being the Armenians. 1.5 million of them were systemically exterminated in this war. The ideological justification of this is fundamentally identical to that of the State of Israel, Jewish Nationalism or Zionism. Following the war, the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne created a compulsory population exchange involving 1.2 million ethnic Greeks from Turkey and 500,000 Muslims from Greece.

This was explicitly endorsed and enforced as state policy to create an ethnically homogeneous nation. If Israel had the same intentions, they failed. This is not, and has not been reflected in the ethnic makeup of the State of Israel.

The only *possible* difference between these two circumstances that would make Israel illegitimate and Turkey legitimate, is that many Israelis came from Europe instead of the Middle East. However I fail to see how this is relevant to the actual act of ethnic cleansing and population swaps that makes Israel illegitimate in the first place. 

Out of consistency, all pro-Palestinians who think that Israel is an illegitimate state per the principles of its founding should also apply this standard to the State of Turkey and many other states around the world.

All 'anti-zionists', who want the destruction and/or dissolution of Israel entirely (not just them to stop their actions in the West Bank or Gaza and implement a two-state solution) should also be in favour of the destruction/dissolution of Turkey and right of return for all displaced Greeks (and Muslims) from both countries.  
  
The fact that Turks happened to *also* be in modern-day Turkey for a very long time is irrelevant to the question of whether or not ethnic cleansing (or 'population swaps, as it was called') makes the state that did it illegitimate. Saying that Israel is a 'European Colonial Venture' has nothing to do with the logic presented nor do I particularly care about the recklessness of the British Empire in the dissolution of their mandates.

1cqsuws,"CMV:Islam is evil, and the biggest threat to the West","First. Let’s get this out the way before someone’s chimes in with the “Islamophobic” retort. Criticizing Islam isn’t hateful. Or racist. Arabs are fine. Islam is not. I hold all 3 religions in nearly equal contempt. However the other two are in the 21st century at least. There are a frightening number of radicals worldwide. The religion itself was built on conquest and spread by the sword. Muhammad was a pedophile. And Islam actually got better for awhile. Then I want to say around the 1700s/1800s you started having these different schools of thought. Then you had Sayyid Qutb come along in the early 1900s. He’s basically the father of modern day Islamism. Let me explain two different kinds of people. 

There is a difference between radicals and terrorists. A small minority are terrorists.

15-25% of all muslims are radical in their beliefs, meaning they believe one or a combination of the following:

1.	⁠Being gay should be illegal.
2.	⁠Honor killings are sometimes justified.
3.	⁠Apostates should be killed.
4.	⁠Terrorist attacks against civilian centers is sometimes justified.

Anyone who believes those things is a radical. Regardless if Islam teaches it or some government says it. In this specific case, 15-25% or more muslims believe some of these things. There are polls recently that show close to 90 percent of Gazans support Hamas. A majority supported October 7th. 93 percent of Palestinians oppose homosexuality. Close to 40 percent of young British Muslims believe apostates should be killed. I can go on and on. And that is why I believe Islam evil and a grave threat.

I think I've seen at least ten posts a day about this with the same messages. But I do feel that as someone with barely any personal ties to these conflicts, I feel I just don't really think I can say who is right. Plus having a wide variety of friends and my knack for researching tons of information has exposed me to different views which has made it only harder to truly pick a side of sorts.

I have several friends who protested and while most of them didn't see too much fighting (their schools mostly just had a two hour rally and everyone left afterwards), the ones who did see battles like at UCLA or Columbia were much more distressed and I did spend some time comforting them as a friend even if I had told them I was more or less neutral, which they understood and had no problem with.

1csgums,CMV: It’s perfectly acceptable to care about a potential partner’s sexual history ,"It’s no secret that there is a double standard between men and women on this topic. Men’s promiscuity tends to get a pass or even praise while womens’ tends to get cringed at or shamed. 

But I think regardless of gender, it’s not an unfair standard to want a partner that hasn’t slept around a ton. A popular sentiment online is that if I found out well into a relationship that my partner had slept with 50 people, any emotional reaction I may have can only be the result of insecurity. 

Is it inherently insecure to not want a person who is willing to let their body be used by numerous strangers? At the very least I think I’m justified in thinking “ew”, and that doesn’t have to be because of my own insecurity. 

I’m no prude. I don’t think sex is sacred or anything.

1cis8r4,CMV: Standing in solidarity with Palestinians does not mean endorsing or supporting everything Palestinians believe in,"When I discuss with people here about Israel/Palestine issues, I will always get accused of supporting Hamas or condoning the Oct 7th attacks because many Palestinians do, but this is a line of reasoning I don't follow. When Nat Turner rebelled and killed more than 50 White people, abolitionists did not stop supporting abolition, in fact he is viewed quite favourably today by African Americans. Or when ANC bombed Church Street which killed 19 people and wounded 200 more, many South African Blacks saw that as justified yet it doesn't mean one should stop opposing the apartheid. Similarly, just because many Palestinians believe that the Oct 7th attacks are justified, it doesn't mean that I think they are justified and, more importantly, that I should stop supporting them in getting their right to self determination.  

The other accusation I get a lot is that I am homophobic to support the Palestinians, which is strange given that I am bisexual myself. Truth be told, when considering all matters in politics, I probably have more in common with the average Israeli than the average Palestinian, but the right to self-determination, the right to safety, and the right to basic necessities are not and should not be conditioned on someone having political beliefs that align with mine. If that is the case then I would not support most self-determination movements in the world because I am solidly on the left on most issues.

I think the converse is true as well, if someone is standing in solidarity with Israelis, I do not immediately assume that they support Bibi or the Israeli settlers (in fact odds are they don't). I am very well aware that someone can simply believe in Israel's right to self-defence without taking Bibi's actual political positions into account.

1cz17gg,"CMV: The reason there’s so much loneliness in America today is because we the people have replaced our traditional institutions of community in America with social media and the internet, which are half-measures at best and actively harmful at worst.","
Humans are, in my opinion, naturally lazy creatures who will always choose the path of least resistance in almost anything. This includes communication. Throughout most of human history our sense of community was connected to our ability to travel to meet other people or other peoples ability to travel to us. 

The postal service, mail, letters, tv radio shows and phones all altered the equation but none more fundamentally then the internet did. The internet offered something unique. The *closest* simulation you could get to having a person/people in the room with you while also being alone. It has the trappings of community but none of the soul.

Low investment, low barrier to entry. Those are the hallmarks of social media. Yes it’s monetized in variety of different ways but on the whole it’s accessible and easily available at no cost to almost anyone. But it’s this lack of investment that causes the problem. People feel less satisfied, more lonely and more disconnected because the crutches they’ve fallen back on — again the path of least resistance — are empty calories. They provide no real nutrition, no food for the soul, they can aid people in connecting but they’re a tool. Not a solution in my opinion. 

My nephew is the textbook example of social media’s failed promise. He’s probably on the autism spectrum, he’s naturally shy and as a result has almost no friends in school. But with social media, game chats and YouTube to provide nourishment it should be no problem right? 

Wrong. 

He’s almost graduated high school and god love him, he’s emotionally stunted. Idk how he’s gonna meet a man/woman, how he’ll fall in love, how he’ll build a network of friends, how he’ll even hold down a job if he’s never exercised, never developed, the “muscles” you need to form meaningful, longterm connections with other humans. 

It’s not to say people like that are doomed. They’re not. I’m not on the spectrum but I had many of the same problems as he did in school but I was forced/forced myself to develop a personality and learn how to work and be social outside of a screen.

However, this doesn't make sense. 

If you truly believe that the 2020 election was compromised by the deep state/George Soros/the Democrats/whoever Alex Jones is blaming this week, in favor of Biden, then it doesn't make sense to even bother voting for Trump.

For example Palestine, at most has lost about 1% of its population. Which is terrible don’t get me wrong but its still nowhere close to being genocide levels.

1csqdpf,CMV: Muting mics during a Biden/Trump debate actually benefits Trump's style of debating.,"Biden and Trump are scheduled to debate ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/15/biden-challenges-trump-to-two-debates-before-election.html)).

A lot of people are praising this as a win generally, but especially for Biden because it will stop Trump from interrupting Biden during his responses. I don't think that's right. In fact, I think muting the mics will benefit Trump much more than Biden.

Muting someone's mic when it's not their turn to respond does *not* stop interruptions, it only stops the audience from hearing it. Consider this: Biden is answering a question posed to him. Meanwhile Trump is talking and rambling over Biden. If Biden gets distracted by this (as any reasonable person would), then this could very easily throw off Biden's response. But to the wider audience who can't hear Trump's interruptions, it will simply look like Biden is stammering, stuttering, or otherwise ""too old"". Especially in an era where sound bites and TikToks drive political perceptions, this could end up looking really bad for Biden.

I realize Biden could also employ this kind of tactic, but it's simply not his debate style. Trump's debate style on the other hand is very suited for this kind of tactic.

There could be ways to mitigate this though. Part of the debate rules could include a requirement that both candidates are visible at all times (like a PIP), or the two can be physically separated (like being televised in different rooms). But I think on its own, the rule to mute mics for the person not responding will mostly benefit Trump in the debates.

I would like to believe that the political debates are as fair as possible, so please CMV.",Slightly_Sleepless,849,581,0.8199999928474426,0.37986891578147153,1715793821,/r/changemyview/comments/1csqdpf/cmv_muting_mics_during_a_bidentrump_debate/,2024,5

1d1h20u,"CMV: Being homeless is a situation that is next to impossible to get out of without financial assistance, and or free room and board for at least a couple of months. This could be from any source. Expecting someone to do it alone is unrealistic. ","Alright, so disclosure, I’m homeless currently. I’ve been homeless for roughly 7 months now. So I have a different perspective on this than probably the majority of people who might see this thread. I also have had the better part of a year to get a closer look at how this really works and what options are available. 

So imagine this scenario: You receive disability income at $900 a month. You do not have a permanent residence. Your disability stipulates that you can earn up to an additional $900/mo before losing benefits. You receive a check on the 3rd of every month for $900. 

Okay, so on the 3rd of, let’s say, June, you check into the cheapest motel you can find. It’s $76/night, or $350/week. No monthly rate. That means a month is $1,400. Already more than you have. The most you can afford is two weeks, for $700. Now you have $200 left. You will need to use this money for food, unless you have EBT. Let’s assume you do, and food is not a cost you have to be concerned with. Your checkout date is June 16th.

Let’s say that on day one you apply at, say, McDonald’s, and they hire you, on day one. And you begin work on the 4th of June. Both of those things are unlikely, but let’s roll with it. 

They have presumably agreed to hire you part time, and keep your monthly pay at under $900. Let’s also assume that you started work at the perfect time in the pay period, and you will be paid in exactly 1 week and 6 days. Also unlikely. You will be paid on June 17th, and will be evicted from the motel the day before you get paid. But you’re tough, you sleep in a park that night and roll with the punches. You get paid $450 before tax, so probably around $400 after taxes, generously. Congratulations, you can now afford another whole 7 days in a motel! 

Unfortunately, you won’t be paid for 14 days, with no reliable or consistent way to bridge that gap. Homeless shelters are frequently full, and rarely near where you need to be to work. They also have strict curfews, and no excuse (even working) will bypass that. You probably also haven’t got phone service, because the entirety of your money is going to your motel. This means you cannot call a shelter before heading to it to see if they have a bed, not that it would matter anyway as they don’t reserve them. So you will waste away your entire day and or night walking around to find a place to stay. 

During this time, you will more than likely be fired, as you have nowhere to sleep, no way to shower, nowhere to put your belongings (whatever they may be) no way to wash your clothes, and ostensibly no food to eat. You will try to show up for work, because you’re not a quitter, but you’re haggard, tired, and smelly, not to mention fatigued from lack of nutrition. 


This is just a taste of the struggle of the cycle of homelessness. You could change my view by demonstrating that my assessment of the situation isn’t accurate, and provide me with evidence.

1citg0m,CMV: The Man vs Bear debate is sexist,"As a backpacker I have literally witnessed multiple times the fact that women gladly pick the man over the bear. Solo women hikers are common on the trail and they never have any issue approaching me in the woods, or basically any other man. However if you tell them you saw a bear up the trail, they will likely stop and want to stick with you. I was hiking with a guy who got a call from a girl saying she saw a bear ahead so she turned around and got off the trail. So we went and made sure the coast was clear for her. When actually confronted with this choice, women will basically always do the exact opposite of what they type into social media. 

The protocol out there for a bear is to calmly back away and not look at it. The protocol when coming across a stranger is to smile and wave. To pretend the two are comparable is downright insane.

Statistically, men that will harm you are an EXTREME minority. There are around 100 million men age 15-64 in the US. There are estimated to be 500k sexual assault related incidents a year with factoring in under reporting issues. That means around 0.5% of men are committing these crimes. That is assuming the distribution is uniform, but it's not. Most of these crimes are coming from the same people over and over. 60% of them are rearrested within 5 years! 14% get arrested again before their trial is even over, More than half of rapists had previous convictions. It would be very safe to say that according to many sources I have looked at, the guys you don't want to come across in the woods make up less than 0.2% of men. Then even if you cross one, there is another percentage chance to calculate on whether they actually do something bad or not.

I am all for spreading the message. The me too movement was an awesome way to do it that opened some eyes to the reality that we do have a big problem. It didn't degrade men. It wasn't rooted in lies and hatred for men. This bear thing on the other hand is just gender war fuel. Look around, do you think it worked? No one they wanted to reach is taking it seriously because people see the nonsense it is made of. I just saw a guy being called a rapist for nothing more than choosing man instead of bear. Also just saw a video where a MAN protecting his family from a bear got clawed and it was clipped out and retitled to try to make bears look like a better choice. You can't get anywhere with a movement based on lies. There are proper ways to bring awareness, but ya'll really shot yourself in the foot on this one. The vast majority of men are with you. But when you make a ridiculous statement like ""men are more dangerous than bears"", you can only push more men away from being allies.

1cmfr1l,CMV: Dropping birth rates isn't an actual problem. ,"I've seen more and more headlines and news outlets in the last year talking about how horrible it is more people aren't having babies. Everything from blaming selfish millennials to focusing on how our economy can't be sustained without more kids. 

I have so many problems with this. But the main is that it's such a waste of time to keep circling around ""we need more babies"" mind set for our economy. 

We have advanced technology, brilliant scientists, more knowledge at our fingertips than ever before. Why are we STILL so reliant on an economic model in which human population MUST grow or society will collapse one day? Really? No one can problem solve some and spearhead some solutions here? 

Not to mention, we can't just grow indefinitely. Truly, we can't. We've already wreaked havoc on the environment and our natural habitats. We're practically an invasive species. 

Less people in the future means less cars driving to pollute the air, less consumerism, less suburban sprawl to ruin beautiful land with strip malls and mcmansions. It'd also mean cheaper homes in better locations. 

Of course, there are issues with having less young people. The older generation needing to be taken care of seems to be the biggest fear I hear echoed, but again, there could be a solution for that. For example, actually PAYING nursing home workers better and providing benefits so more people flock to the field? Maybe we'll need less schools in the future if there are less kids. Funding and resources can be allocated to the elderly. I'm not even saying that's a great idea. I am not a brilliant scientist or someone with political power. But even stupid me can see that there are ways to problem solve some of the issues rather than blaming the younger generations and forcing women to give birth. 

I'm tired of hearing it talked about. Because at the end of the day, it's a mute point. Women have birth control (for now), and we have a sense of self and the right to choose. We aren't the generations of the past who had 10+ kids. And we probably never will be again. We have to move on and focus on new ways to live rather than trying to boom a population growth spurt when it simply will not happen.

1chzwpu,"CMV: Saying that you'd ""rather meet a wild bear in the woods than a random man"" is the same kind of logic that racists and other bigots use.","To say that you would rather meet a bear than a random man in the woods requires that you believe all men are a threat, or at least more so a threat than a wild bear. This is the same kind of logic that racists use to justify their racism, and why they typically believe that the races should be separate because one race poses a danger to the other. Both points of view require a demonization of an entire group of people with a blanket assumption that that group is inherently dangerous. The first is sexist, and the second is racist.

Some counterarguments I've seen so far that I'd like to address:  
**1) Women may have had bad experiences with men, so they will have a (justified) aversion.**  
 \- If someone from Race Y has had bad experiences with Race X, they are not justified in painting all people of Race X as an inherent danger because they have not encountered 99% of the people from Race X. They are basing this fear off of a very small population compared to the overall population most of the time. Even if they've had 100s of bad experiences with men or Race X, to preemptively fear all of them is either sexist or racist. It is more rational and appropriate to assume a man or a person from another race is their own individual person, rather than treating  them as a monolith with a sexist or racist view.

**2) It's not about men in particular, but strangers**  
 \- If that were true, then the meme/saying wouldn't specify men. It would include meeting a random woman.

**3) It's not about all men, it's about random men**  
\- ""I can't be racist, I have a friend from race X."" Again, to fear *all* strangers from a group requires that you believe that group of people has inherently negative qualities, which is racist, sexist, etc, and that encountering them puts you at an increased danger than being with people from another group, or a bear.

**4) Men have power over women in society, so women are justified in feeling this way**  
\- Neo nazis and fascists will often say that Jewish people have all the power in society. This doesn't make it right for them to demonize them. Further, even if it is true that men have power over women, that tells you nothing about the random man front of you. In order to fear every man, you have to believe every man is dangerous or likely dangerous, which is sexist (or racist if we switch 'man' to 'person of race X'

I think the danger of this kind of thinking can easily be seen if you just switch out the subject. ""I'd rather meet a wild bear in the woods instead of a random person from a different race.""

A woman can absolutely feel this way, of course, but I don't think we should act like it's anything other than sexism, just like it'd be racist if this were about race.",Caseated_Omentum,20,1137,0.5099999904632568,0.2835973509208084,1714604004,/r/changemyview/comments/1chzwpu/cmv_saying_that_youd_rather_meet_a_wild_bear_in/,2024,5

1cspqkr,CMV:Misandry is deemed acceptable in western society and feminism pushes men towards the toxic manosphere ,"Basically what the title states.

Open and blatant misandry is perfectly acceptable in today's western society. You see women espouse online how they ""hate all men"" and ""want to kill all men"".

If you ask them to replace the word men or man in their sentence with women or woman and ask if they find that statement misogynistic, they say ""it's not the same!""

Not one of her friends, who are all big time feminist, corrected her or told her she is being sexist, in fact some of them laughed and agreed.

This post is not an incel ""fuck feminism"" take post.

They go to rallies, marches, post constantly online about how die hard of a feminist they are, and no one in the movement denounces them or throws them out for corrupting the message.

1cmax98,CMV: The bear-vs-man hypothesis does raise serious social issues but the argument itself is deeply flawed,"So in a TikTok video that has since gone viral women were asked whether they'd rather be stuck in the woods with a man or a bear. Most women answered that they'd rather be stuck with a bear. Since then the debate has intensified online with many claiming that bears are definitely the safer option for reasons such as that they're more predictable and that bear attacks are very rare compared to murder and rape commited by men. 

First of all I totally acknowledge that there are significant levels of physical and sexual violence perpetrated by men against women. I would argue the fact that men women answered they'd rather be stuck in the woods with a men does show that male violence prepetrated against women is a significant social issue. Many women throughout their lifetime will be the victim of physical or sexual violence commited by a man. So for that reason the hypothetical bear-vs-man scenario does point to very serious and wide-spread social issues. 

On the other hand though there seem to be many people who take the argument at face-value and genuinely believe that women would be safer in the woods with a random bear than with a random man. That argument is deeply flawed and can be easily disproven. 

For example in the US annually around 3 women get killed per 100,000 male population. With 600,000 bears in North-America and around 1 annual fatality bears have a fatality rate of around 0.17 per 100,000 bear population. So bears are roughly 20 times more deadly to women than American men. 

However, I would assume that the average American woman does not spend more than 15 seconds per year in close proximity to a bear. Most women, however, spend more than 1000 hours each year around men. Let's assume for just a moment that men only ever kill women when they are alone with her. And let's say the average woman only spent 40 hours each year alone with a man, which is around 15 minutes per day. That would still make a bear 480 times more likely to kill a woman during an interaction. 

40 hours (144,000 seconds) / 15 seconds (average time I guess a woman spends each year around a bear) = 9600 

9600 / 20 (men have a homicide rate around per 100k population around 20 times that of a bear) = 480

It's not just in numbers. I've faced discrimination by Muslims irl. I've seen Muslims I know, neighbors and classmates, say online gay people are ""sick"" and that Western women are trash. 

I'm from a Catholic third world country. An immigrant. In my country, where over 90% of the population is Catholic, I never faced discrimination. Just some stares. We recently legalized gay marriage. I consider myself Christian and I've never been treated differently by other Christian. So even though the Bible does have homophobic messages, most Christian don't hold those views.

However, most Muslims do hold those views. My friends in Belgium and France say it's worst there.  In these first world, Western countries Muslims already hold regressive views. In the Middle East, it's even worse. The regions with more support for sharia law are Palestine and Iraq, with over 90% of people there believing I should be executed.

My classmates invited us to a mosque, to ""connect"" with that group, why should I go to a place where they want me dead? Why should I care if a mosque is not allowed to be, if Muslim men are not allowed to pray at work, when they want me dead? Why should I denounce islamophobia when Muslims would hand me over to executioners without a care in the world? As long as their physical wellbeing is intact, then I simply do not care

1d3jdol,CMV: There is much subtext to the Israel - Hamas war.  But not everybody gets this.   Bad actors ON BOTH SIDES constantly shift between the specific and the general to muddy the waters and make progress difficult,"

I don't think anybody has covered themselves with glory, post 10/7. When Chuck Shumer publicly calls out Benjamin Netanyahu, on the floor of the United States Senate, then it is clear that Israel, under Netanyahus leadership, has gone off the rails. What happened after that? Chuck Shumer was called an 'anti-semite,' and Israel kept barreling down that path.

This is a lot of anger at Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, all of which he has earned, and which he hides behind the Israeli people to avoid, calling any and all criticism of his specific actions just general anti-semitism.

I also think people conflate the Palestinian people with Hamas.  Hamas, ostensibly, is the governing party in the Gaza strip, but Hamas, as an organization, derives from the Muslim brotherhood, is largely funded and fueled by non-Palestinian Arabs who are hiding among and behind the Palestians in Gaza, more than half of whom are under the age of 15.    The October 7 attack was not a legitimate piece of governance, but a specific attack on Israelis and and a continuation of the oppression of the Palestinians.

With specific regard to American protestors I think the fact that this is happening now, when the Shoah fades from living memory, and much history lies between us and World War II, is of interest. I would venture to guess that the majority of people protesting, and most of the younger ones, grew up in a relatively peaceful world with a strong Israeli nation, and don't have the historical context to understand the Jewish state: they may regard it as just another country, acting badly, and protest accordingly. This may, fairly, be regarded as a form of naivete. That is, at least, how I regard it. But there are two, small but vocal groups who have a propensity to hijack the narrative. The first is the amoral pugilist: they just love to fight and will employ whatever dirty tactics necessary to prevail. They will employ anti-semitic tropes to put people off balance and 'stir the pot.' The second is the true anti-semite, who see, in Israels present behavior, an excuse to let their hate flag fly. Both of these groups, I venture to say, take advantage of the naivete of the majority to push their anger and hate and derail any manner of constructive dialogue: call it the Yigal Amir veto, if you will. 

So it is valid criticisms of specific actions, by belligerents, (Netenyahu, et all, and Hamas)  that are then attacked as support for generalities: Pro-Palestianian is equated to Pro-Hamas, and criticisism of specific Israel action is termed generic anti-semitism.  All of this muddies the water and makes resolution of this so much more difficult, which is what the haters, on both sides, want.

1cpdcgp,"CMV: Biden's attempt to appease both sides of the Gaza issue is hurting his electoral chances, he should commit to one side and accept the consequences.","Recently, there have been multiple reports on the divide between Netanyahu and Biden, but they have been conflicting, or at least mixed messages. Here's a report by [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68984999) saying that it is ""reasonable to assess"" that arms supplied by the US have been used in ways ""inconsistent"" with Israel's obligations, but in the same [report](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-administration-says-israel-isnt-violating-us-weapons-terms-rcna151764) it says that it hasn’t verified specific instances that would justify withholding military aid, and the headline used for each outlet is different depending on what the journalist prefer to highlight. Biden has also withheld military supplies and threatened to withhold more, as reported [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68980820), but not enough to actually stop the Rafah invasion from happening. 

To me, this is an attempt by him to appease both the pro-Israel and the pro-Palestine camps within the Democratic party, but I think he's failing at both. Pro-Israel folks will see this as a severe stepback from the unconditional support US has historically provided to Israel, while the Pro-Palestine folks will still see him as complicit in the genocide in Gaza as long as the Rafah invasion goes ahead, and the campus protests are unlikely to die out anytime soon. I think the most disastrous outcome for Biden is neither side doesn't feel like they can vote for him anymore in the election, handing Trump a victory.

1csag26,CMV: There is nothing wrong with female students helping a male teacher unbraid his hair,"If you haven’t seen the news recently JaQ Lee is a teacher that went viral for making a video with his female students helping him unbraid his hair. He only asked his students to help him unbraid his hair because he had a hair appointment after school that day and he wouldn’t be able to unbraid his hair in time if he waited until after school.

Prior to making this video he had already posted many videos of his students. It is very obvious that he loves his job and he loved his students. However recently he was fired for that video. Many people think it is inappropriate for him to have his female students unbraiding his hair even though it is obvious he had no ill intentions against his students. However I have to disagree.

It is a teachers job to build strong bonds with their students. A strong bond between a teacher and their student is the main way for a student to trust their teacher. A student who trusts their teacher is more likely to listen to that teacher when they teacher and is more likely to go to that teacher if they have any issues. It is obvious that this was just another way for him to bond with his students. 

Also it is just hair. People are acting as if the students were putting lotion on his back or cutting his toenails. The students were just helping him unbraid his hair what exactly is the harm behind that.

In the black community many of us don’t have strong male figures in our lives. When a male role model does enter our life we look up to them and admire them. Majority of his students are black. It is very possible that many of his students may not have a male role model in their life and because of the strong bond they have with their teacher they look up to him and admire him. Helping him unbraid his hair is a way for his students to bond with him and show their appreciation for him.

It is very possible that now since this teacher has been fired that the students in that classes grades will drop. They had a lot of trust and respect in Mr.Lee and it will be hard for a new teacher to gain these students trust and respect. The students may not listen in class anymore leading to their grades dropping. A lot of negative things could happen as a result to this school firing an amazing teacher.

1cm7v5h,CMV: There is no valid aviation-safety-related reason for airplane mode in modern airliners,"Airplane mode makes little difference to the navigation or communication capabilities of a modern airliner. First, the bands that a mobile phone tranmit on (800MHz upwards) do not overlap with the coms radio of airliners (100-300MHz for VHF and lower for HF). Second, they largely do not tranmit on the same bands as what’s used for navigation either, and either way ground based navaids are going the way of the dodo, and what’s left that’s commonly used is only ILS systems. One could argue that they may interfere with GPS since they both use GPS, but that’s neither here nor there or else GPS would break down in a slightly more crowded area.  

The simplest way to explain my point would be, if having mobile phones off airplane mode is so dangerous, then terrorists wouldn’t need to go to the trouble of bringing a bomb or some such, they merely need to turn on their $200 phone and that would be enough.  

Finally, to clarify, I am narrowing the scope of this to aviation safety related reasons. I don’t care if your phones might impact cell towers which might just happen to make an emergency call be delayed. And I don’t care if it’s because the law tells you to.

1cmmqqx,CMV: There is still no genocide occurring in Gaza.,"
This has been a claim repeated since the day of the Oct 7th massacre. This claim that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people of Gaza. and have been attempting genocide for decades now.   


This claim has no sensible basis. I think there are are many ways I could tackle this but by far the strongest arguments against this claim is just in a simple review of the numbers.   


Hamas states the current death toll as around 35000 or roughly about 1.75% of the total population.   
The population of Gaza being 2 million.  
Therefore currently a bit over 98% of Gazans remain alive according to that number.

Now here come the important points.

Firstly Israel has the military capability to nuke Gaza, but more importantly they have enough conventional ordinance to do as much damage as nuke on Gaza would do. In fact they have dropped more than twice the explosive equivalent of the two nukes dropped on Japan.

Note that the combined l death toll of the initial explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was between 60,000 & 80,000

Gaza city specifically has a population of 590,481 and was the most densely populated part of Gaza. It was significantly more densely populated than both the cities in Japan. Currently the refugees in Rafah are just as tightly packed together if not more tightly.

This brings us to 2 points 

It is simply true, that 

1. If Israel wanted to, they could quite literally kill virtually the entire population in a night.

They haven't

It is also simply true, that 

2. the amount of bombs Israel has already dropped has had enough explosion power to kill the majority of the population. 

Yet the vast majority lives, therefore the bombs can not have been intended with a goal of genocide. 

The only logical conclusion from these two points is that they Israel has not attempt to kill as many civilians as they can but have in fact attempted the opposite thus there is no genocide.   


P.S if you’re response to this is some version of 

“so your complaint is not enough Palestinians have died yet” 

Please don’t bother commenting, it is better that you don’t waste everyone’s time.

1d1adl1,cmv: The Electoral College should not be winner takes all for each state,"I've seen, over the years, plenty of arguments about the electoral college. Ranging from it being a hallmark of our country, a cornerstone that if changed would lead to everything falling, to being a cancerous stain upon what could otherwise be a democracy.

  
From where I stand, the biggest problem with the Electoral College is that each state is winner takes all. Look at Florida, for example. It is a state which, for the most part, is 50/50. A nail biter of counting, where nobody knows who will get all of the votes. Entire elections hinge upon such counting. And then other states, which are solidly blue or red....they don't matter. Because everyone knows which party is getting all of the votes. 

  
So, where do I stand? If you get 50% of the votes in a state, then you get 50% of the electoral votes. Odd numbers go to whomever get more. Florida, for example, has 125 electoral votes. In 2020 Trump got 51% of vote, meaning he got all 125 electoral votes. I argue that he should have gotten 63. 

  
By splitting it this way, every state becomes in play. Let's say democrats get 40% of the vote in Texas. Usually that would mean absolutely nothing, but now it means 40% of the electoral votes. The same for Republicans in say, California. This makes every state a battleground state, and every vote matters. Candidates can't ignore the vast majority of the country, and nobody would be able to shrug and say that their vote doesn't matter because of the state they live in. 

  
I honestly can't see any downside to this. But when I posted something similar in a different subreddit, I got downvoted with no replies, and that means that there are different points of views. So, I'm posting this here, as  I am willing to have my view changed on this.

1ctwoqa,CMV: Conservatives aren't generally harder-working than liberals or leftists despite the conventional wisdom.,"In the USA, at least, there's a common assumption that republicans/conservatives don't have time to get worked up about issues of the day because they're too focused on providing for their families and keeping their noses to the grindstone to get into much trouble.

The argument is that committing suicide sounds like they're doing something wrong. Since you commit crimes and historically suicide, or attempts to do so were illegal.

But we don't just use ""commit"" as a crime. It's also just means to pledge, or just carry out. You commit resources. You commit to a relationship. You commit energy.

1cs557z,CMV: Disparity in any system is not automatically evidence of discriminatory practices,"This seems to be a common sentiment for a lot of people and I think it's a projection of their ideology, which is one not of equality, but equity.

For the purposes of this post I use the definition of equity as meaning ""Equal outcomes for all identity groups"". But that is not realistic or rational.

Equity is not natural and for companies/corporations for example, you can't expect the demography of the company to match the demography of the surrounding area, and for larger corporations it's especially unreasonable to expect the corporation as a whole to match the demography of the entire country. I'm talking about America, and in a place like America each state has different demography depending on the state and even the county.

But even so, you can't expect the demography of even a county to match every company in that county. People have different interests and capabilities for any number of reasons and that's normal and okay.

I don't think ironworkers are mostly men because they dedicate energy to discriminating against women. Same with construction workers. Or oil rig workers.

I don't think Kindergarten teachers are mostly women because they dedicate energy to discriminating against men. Same with nurses. Or secretaries.

I think this is just a natural reflection of the biological differences between males and females and our natural tendencies, aptitudes, and personality traits.

This could apply to ethnic groups as well, for any number of reasons. Sometimes those reasons seem arbitrary, and that's okay. But I think usually it's cultural.

In 2006, Joe Biden, remarked that ""you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent"". I guess what he meant is that most people who own gas stations and convenience stores are Indian/Pakistani/etc. I seem to recall he made a similar statement during a political debate.

People bristle at comments like these, saying they're racial stereotypes. But they're true? The statistics back that up.

I hope the anti-AI crowd will forgive me, but I had this funny dialogue with ChatGPT just now. In asking about Biden's remarks, it says:

>This remark was widely criticized as being insensitive and perpetuating stereotypes about Indian-Americans. While the comment was specifically about Indian-Americans, it does touch upon a broader stereotype that certain immigrant groups are heavily represented in the ownership of convenience stores and gas stations.

But then I asked it, ""Which demographic group is dominant when it comes to ownership of convenience stores and gas stations?""

And the answer included:

>""...one prominent group is Indian-Americans, particularly those of Gujarati descent. This demographic has a substantial presence in the convenience store and gas station industry.  
>  
>Other demographic groups, including Arab-Americans, Korean-Americans, and Pakistani-Americans, also have a significant presence in the ownership of convenience stores and gas stations.""

So...reality is insensitive? This stereotype is bad? But the stereotypes are literally true according to the data.

Does this mean that the gas station ownership industry is discriminating against white men? I don't see any reason to think so. Why is it a bad thing that certain ethnic groups dominate the ownership of various businesses? Asian-Americans owning laundromats is another one that comes to mind.

My thought is, who cares? Why is this a bad thing? I just see it as another interesting quirk of living in a multicultural society. There are certain things attributed to various ethnic groups for various reasons and that's just part of the delightful tapestry of a diverse society.

The way I see it, it's okay that we have lopsided representation of various groups in various different fields. There are many different kinds of companies/hobbies/whatever, and they have many different kinds of work cultures, required aptitudes and personality types for the employees, and this results in sometimes unequal representation. And that's okay.

I could expand on the title of this CMV to relate to many other, more ""serious"" topics, but that would make this post much longer and much more complicated.

Anyway, a lot of people seem to disagree with the idea that disparity is not automatically evidence of discrimination. Why is that?

The world already thinks that were this privileged, media controlling entity, I got a bad feeling this act will not be a good law for Jews. We have so many hideous stereotypes against us as is, this will add further to it. 

P.S. if you come here to argue about Israel versus Palestine you will be blocked and reported. My post is strictly about the new law. If you come here to talk about Israel being evil or some other antisemitic dogshit you will not be entertained. Please stick to the talking points about this potential act becoming a law.
