1hhujbm,CMV: The left and right should not argue because we should be focused on taking down the ultra wealthy instead,"I have been having arguments with family recently who voted for Trump this past election when I voted for Kamala. I had the realization that us arguing amongst ourselves helps the ultra wealthy because it misdirects our focus to each other instead of them.

It's getting to a point where I want to cut ties with them because it's starting to take a toll on my mental health because the arguments aren't going anywhere but wouldn't that also help the ultra wealthy win if we become divided?

Luigi Mangione has plead not guilty to the murder of Brian Thompson. His lawyer asserts that there is no proof that he did it. I agree that there is no proof that we can see that he did it.

There is no evidence that the man who shot Brian Thompson and rode away on a bike is the man who checked into a hostel with a fake ID and was arrested in Pennsylvania. They had different clothes and different backpacks.

1hksiq5,CMV: Reddit is a far left echo chamber.,"The general reputation of Reddit is that it leans very far to the left, and if you use it much at all, you can easily understand why. Many of the largest subreddits are filled with progressive or far-left takes, and the way the site functions tends to amplify those perspectives. While plenty of communities cater to other ways of thinking, the general culture of Reddit is slanted left. It's become sort of an echo chamber for those ideas, and alternative views really don't get much traction.

First off, many of the most popular subreddits on Reddit have to do with progressive or socialist issues. Places like r/politics, r/antiwork, and r/latestagecapitalism are filled with posts railing against capitalism, billionaires, and big corporations. The discussions go beyond just pointing out problems, too—they can get really extreme. You see and hear people quite vociferously saying that billionaires don't deserve to exist and calling CEOs-bankrupting industries for profit, specifically the ones dealing in healthcare-are something people say quite easily; from basic 'Billionaires deserves to lose everything' comments up to and including outright physical or other forms of suggested violence. These posts gain thousands of upvotes, so they are on the front page, reinforcing the leftist vibe.

The voting system on Reddit makes the echo chamber effect even worse. If someone posts a comment or opinion that doesn't fit the dominant narrative-like a conservative or moderate take-it's usually downvoted so hard it disappears. On the other side, everything that corresponds to the popular left-leaning view is upvoted and moved to the top. That means just one side of the argument is really seen, while opposing viewpoints get buried or ignored. Over time, this just discourages people with different perspectives from even bothering to engage. Why post something if it's just going to get downvoted into oblivion?

Then, of course, there is the huge role of moderation in giving shape to the overall tone of the platform. Large subreddits are run by their moderators, who are themselves often very left-leaning. They can be very quick to remove posts or ban users if they don't agree with the content, even when it doesn't break any rules. Such moderation makes a one-sided space where alternative viewpoints are not just unpopular but also actively suppressed. It's unsurprising that people view Reddit as a hostile place for anyone who doesn't align with progressive values.

Another reason has to do with the makeup of the site's users: The users go for a younger, more technologically hip audience that can easily go to the left on social issues and politics. Users interact and upvote this content as it speaks for their views, only to increase the presence of the left on this site. Now, for those right-leaning areas of Reddit-areas such as r/Conservative or r/libertarian-they exist but pale in size to the big left leaning behemoths.

At the end of the day, Reddit is not completely bereft of other viewpoints, but the way the site is structured makes it incredibly hard for them to be heard. From the voting system to the heavy-handed moderation to the demographics of the user base, Reddit has devolved into a leftist echo chamber where everything else is drowned out. No surprise there, really, when people think of it that way.

1hghe43,CMV: It's perfectly reasonable for a country to ban or severely restrict immigration from Islamic countries ,"I'm personally generally not a fan of religion. And I think Christianity is also problematic and contains a fair amount bigotry and sexism for example. However, I'd say in 2024 Islam is definitely by the far the most dangerous and most intolerant major religion in the world. Of course there are millions of Muslims who are reasonable people, who have fairly moderate or even progressive views, sure. But by and large the way Islam is being practiced today makes it the most intolerant and most dangerous major religion that exists.

A pretty large percentage of Muslims around the world hold beliefs that are extremely at odds with Western ideals such as democracy, liberty equality and human rights. According to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/#:~:text=Sharia%20as%20the%20Official%20Law%20of%20the%20Land&text=In%20South%20Asia%2C%20high%20percentages,%25) a very significant percentage of Muslims worldwide support Sharia law, and of those a significant percentage believe in things such as the death penalty for leaving Islam or stoning people for adultery. In almost every Muslim-majority homosexuality is illegal and in some it's even punished by death. Many Muslim majority countries have male guardianship laws, blasphemy laws and ex-Muslims in many Muslim countries would risk their lives if they openly came out as ex-Muslim.

And even many Muslims in the West continute to hold many of those extremely illiberal beliefs and ideas. According to a 2015 poll around half of all Muslims in the UK think homosexuality should be illegal, 39% believe a wife should always be obedient to her husband, and 23% support Sharia law. And many Islamic ideology not only has serious consequences for people in the Muslim community but also for society as a whole. The UK for example has a very high rate of forced marriages, the victims often being women from Muslim immigrant families, and the UK also has one of the highest rates of [honor-based violence and killings](https://www.jns.org/uk-honor-based-crimes-up-62-in-2-years/), much of that happening within the Muslim community.

But Islamic ideology also severely affects society as whole in non-Muslim countries. The vast majority of the most deadly terrorist attacks in Europe in the 21st centuries for example were commited by Islamic extremists. The Madrid train bombins, the Paris terror attacks, the Nice truck attack, the London bombins, the Brussels bombings, the Barcelona terror attack, the Manchester arena bombing, that's just a few of the terrorist attacks commited by Islamic extremists in Europe. Islamic ideology has a chilling effect on free speech, with the free press in Europe these days being afraid to publish material the Muslim word could see as offenseive after events like the Charlie Hebdo shooting where employees at a French satirical magazine were killed for saying publishing a caricature of the prophet.[ In the UK a teacher is still in hiding](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13276847/teacher-pupils-cartoon-prophet-mohammed-hiding.html) and fearing for his life, because he dared show students at his school a depiction of prophet Muhammed. I mean how far have we come if a teacher, not in Afghanistan, but in the UK must live in hiding, fearing for his life because they've offended the wrong people?

So in summary I think it's absolutely reasonable for a country to refuse to admit people who adhere to Islamic ideology. Many Muslims may have fairly moderate or even progressive views, and the majority of Muslims are peaceful people for sure. But given how much Islamic ideology has already affected many non-Muslim countries, no government should be expected to gamble with people's lives and admit millions of people from Muslim-majority countries, where inevitable a signficant percentage of those will likely turn out to hold beliefs and ideas that are extremely at odds with Western ideals like liberty and freedom.",RandomGuy92x,1461,1200,0.7400000095367432,0.6340288572995885,1734460517,/r/changemyview/comments/1hghe43/cmv_its_perfectly_reasonable_for_a_country_to_ban/,2024,12
1hc2wam,"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Biden’s legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure. ","Biden will be a historian’s president, loved in between the pages of a book but forgotten and disdained by your average Americans. I voted for Biden in 20 and Harris in 24’ but his presidency will be haunted by the shadow of defeat by trump. There’s no way around it. If you run an incumbent out of office saying “we’re better than this guy!” and then that same guy turns around and runs *you* out of office with overwhelming disapproval by the American public, you lost the battle and the war. 

Nobody cares about his achievements in foreign policy because America is making a turn toward isolationism again — as it’s done throughout its history at various times — nobody cars about build back better or the inflation reduction act. He will be seen as a Jimmy Carter-like figure, impotently standing on the sidelines as a former actor/celebrity rides to power in the Oval Office on Red Wave that reshaped the Republican part in Reagan’s image much as Trump has reshaped the current GOP in his. 

The only thing that spared him from a Carter landslide-like loss is his decision *not* to run for reelection in 24. A decision that came too late as it would turn out, but one saved him from being seen as a total failure unfortunately for him he’s almost 100 years old (or he looks like he’s almost 100 years old) so he won’t have the redemption arc Carter had with Habitat for Humanity.

He’ll die a one-term who will chiefly be remembered for his “senility”, the worst presidential debate performance of all time and the apathy by which most people greeted his arrival, his tenure and his departure from office.

1h44j71,CMV: Men and Women should ALWAYS be held to the same standard within any given job,"I was having a conversation with a woman about why more women aren't pilots and they had all these reasons why, and they said something that gave me pause. They said that in aviation everyone is held to the same standard but when giving the reasons why more women weren't in aviation, they didn't mention that maybe women simply can't or aren't willing to meet that standard. I think firefighting is another job where women are expected to meet the same standard as well.

In jobs such as the military, women are held to an objectively lower standard and arguably a lower subjective standard when it comes to discipline. This doesn't make sense to me as if someone is doing a specific job, regardless of their sex, there is a standard to do that job and I think everyone should be held to that standard period. This means one of two things for me:

1. If someone is unable to meet the standards required for the job then they just don't have the prerequisites required to accomplish the job and should not be hired.
2. If the standards are lowered so that a group of people are able to meet the requirements, then the standards should be lowered across the board because this shows that's the actual standard needed.

The only exception that I can think of doesn't have to do with sex but rather merit where there is something extraordinary about you which would justify waiving a standard.",TheAverageBear132,1027,1333,0.7200000286102295,0.5525103991721132,1733063614,/r/changemyview/comments/1h44j71/cmv_men_and_women_should_always_be_held_to_the/,2024,12
1hbydut,"CMV: Taxation is not theft. In fact, it is more akin to a modest admission ticket to participate in the economy.","I think a lot of people get their paycheck and see tax deductions and feel robbed. Like what do you mean my yearly salary is not actually how much I take home?"" Right? Libertarians make the the saying ""taxation is theft"" their rallying cry, often arguing that no taxation is acceptable, and the government should essentially disband or be at least decimated. 

I think this argument is intuitive to a lot of people because it does not feel like the benefits we get out of our tax dollars is not as valuable to us as the money would have been. When the average person thinks about how tax dollars benefit them they probably think about roads and maybe the mail or schools but not much else unless they receive government benefits like Medicaid or SNAP. In fact, the ways the government helps poor people are a lot more visible than the ways the might help everyone else. When poor people are essentially getting a monthly check from the government every month, I think it's easy for the average person to conclude that taxes are basically a scam to transfer money from working people to bums who don't work. 

But I think the benefit of tax dollars for the average American are actually much greater than we see at a glance, and the average American benefits from taxation far more than they lose because the government creates and manages the economic conditions that allow us to earn so much in the first place. 

Let's say you're a car salesman at a Toyota dealership. That dealership exists because cheap, safe trade is possible with Japan. This safe free trade is facilitated by the US military, which supports the defense of allies like Japan that could be invaded by China if the US were not an ally. If Japan were at war with China, the country might be blockaded, embargoed, or sanctioned by China in ways that make exports more expensive. Japan would also have to devote tremendous resources to their war effort. Domestic labor would be shorthanded and car manufacturing might have to be converted for war machines. If it were possible to get Toyota cars out at all, they would be more expensive. If China won the war they might impose trade restrictions on Japanese cars to the US to support its own vehicle industry. Also keep in mind the Japanese car industry only exists because the United States supported Japan's economic recovery after WW2 (with taxes), which created the Japanese economic miracle, which allows them to keep producing cheap cars. This relationship with Japan is only possible because the US won WW2 (with tax dollars). 

Imagine if FDR had been a penny pinching libertarian. He might have gone to war with Japan but would he have converted US industry to the extent necessary to win the war? Would he have raised taxes to fund the war effort if taxes are inherently theft? Or would he have negotiated for peace the moment he could secure non-aggression with Imperial Japan? Libertarian Truman certainly would never have approved funds to help Japan's economy recover. Libertarian FDR/Truman probably means no winning WW2, no Japanese economic miracle, no cozy trade relationship, which means no cheap cars in 2024. 

Your job selling cars at Toyota exists because of decisions made by the government 80 years ago supported by a tremendous tax burden, and tax dollars continuously spent to support that status quo. And besides you, customers benefit from cheap reliable cars. And the government collects tax revenue on the sales to make up for its expenses. This whole industry that benefits us all would not exist without the government spending money. This is how economies grow and create more wealth overall than existed before taxation.

While Toyota cars are maybe an easy example, there are so many other ways the government upholds the economy, such that this reasoning can apply to any job. Domestic cars? Made with imported steel and exported for profit that allows the company to grow and employ more people. Work at Walmart? Full of cheap imported goods. Bank? Insured by the government. Library? Government. Law? All about the government. Farm? Subsidized by the government. Healthcare? Majorly bloated with employees bc of the government. 

All of this is not to say that the government is perfect or that you should be ""thankful."" I am just arguing that we should recognize that the government is a necessary institution that requires taxes to work. Every day millions of Americans drive to work in Toyota cars on roads built and maintained by the government, kept safe by the government, to work in industries supported by the government, buy goods and services kept cheap by the government, and send their kids to schools provided at no cost by the government and wonder where all their tax dollars are going. Your tax dollars are all around you mate. 

And I know a lot of people are going to say this can all still exist with a free market and no government, but we have never seen that happen in the real world. Imagine what no government truly means. You would have to pay a toll of some sort to use a road if you did not build it yourself. You would have to pay a regular fee for police and fire protection. Your employer would not be required to provide healthcare, a bare minimum salary, or safe working conditions. You would be nickel and dimed at every turn so often that it would be just as bad as paying taxes or worse. And that's only assuming the inevitable corporate monopolies play nice and do not decide to simply enslave you. If a libertarian utopia were possible I just think it would have been accomplished by now. 

There are already places on earth in which there is no government. Haiti's government has collapsed. If you hate the government you can just move there. But it's a gang-controlled hell hole and nobody has the power to stop it except governments. People there are desperate. They would work for pennies to make iphones or flip flops or whatever but nobody can build a factory there because it would be taken over by gangs. Governments create order which creates economies which create wealth. You cannot have the economy and wealth without the government. All the government asks is a small fee in the form of taxes. 

Taxation is not theft, it is a small admissions fee to enjoy the robust, lucrative economy created and maintained by the government. Again, not perfect, but far better than the alternative. The lie that taxation is theft was created and circulated by rich people who know that less government means more power for them.

1hi0od9,CMV: Elon musk having as much power as he does is one of the most deplorable things to ever happen in america.,"This is obviously a subjective opinion. Just want to start by saying that. Im also aware Elon musks companies have provided great value to Americans. The fact that he has essentially infiltrated the American government to the point he is being suggested for speaker of the house is probably the most insane thing I’ve ever witnessed.

It is a textbook example of the worship of the wealthy and the unrestricted power of money in the US government. I find it absolutely insane that he can actually sway government officials including the president when he knows nothing about the average American outside of twitter. In a proper functioning government, what he’s done so far would be illegal. 

I don’t even see what his goal is , he’s as rich as he can get, he has more power than 99.9999% of humans on earth. He is treated like a super genius visionary by many. I mean what the hell else can he get?

The guy is insane. Anyone supporting him is insane. This is a disgrace to the human population and to the US. Genuinely ridiculous and deplorable system.

1hahwza,CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts.,"First off, I am not saying that we should be not shining a light on Israel's crimes, colonial aspirations and possible genocide.   
  
I'm curious as to why no one talks about UAE's involvement in South Sudan, a war that is just as colonial, is longer lasting and has resulted in the death, rape and misplacement of far far more civilians. The UAE has very close ties with the US and receives considerably military, logistic and financial support. Your tax dollars are funding the murder of millions of people in South Sudan.  
  
I've never seen anything on my feed or on any random subreddit about Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. Saudi receives weapons from the US and the UK (and others) and uses them against civilians, causing mass starvation and has resulted in far more deaths than in Gaza. It is currently the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe.   
  
Recently people have been posting about Israel invading parts of Western Syria and destroying chemical weapons facilities but I didn't see a single post when Turkey repeatedly invaded and occupied Northern Syria which they continue to do.   
  
In my view, it can't be lack on emotional bandwidth as all the aforementioned wars started long before the most recent invasion of Gaza. It can't be about colonialism as the UAE's ambitions in South Sudan are purely motivated by economic colonialization. It can't be about the West's support for Israel as we support the UAE just as much as we support Israel, President Mohammed bin Zayed recently visited the White House and Biden called the UAE a ""Major Defense Partner"". Every year they are growing closer with the US, the UK, etc  
  
Again, I'm not suggesting that that people shouldn't be posting about Israel's crimes, but if we care about human suffering, colonialism and our governments supporting awful regimes I should be seeing even more posts about UAE in South Sudan or Saudi Arabia in Yemen or Turkey in Syria.   
  
Is it purely ignorance or is it more sinister antisemitism or something else entirely?

1hkrean,CMV: The man who set a woman alight on the New York subway deserves to die,"I never believed in capital punishment until today, but this guy single handedly converted me.

Burning someone to death is just about the worst thing you can do to them. It is the most excruciating way to die. 

Doing that to an innocent bystander is unconscionable. In fact, that's an understatement. There are no words to describe it. It's beyond comprehension. It's unspeakable.

This murder doesn't just deprive a woman of her life. It hurts every single woman on the planet. Every day, women have to live in ever greater fear of being attacked. This act compounds that problem and actually makes it more likely further attacks will occur. I would argue that everyone suffers as a consequence of that reality.

There are two reasons why the attacker should be tortured to death. 

Firstly, as a deterrent. You will make women - and the general population - safer by punishing this murderer. Something has to be done to protect women and a painful, inhumane death will go some way to achieving that. But all this pales in comparison to the second reason. That reason is retribution.

The world gains nothing from this man's existence. His continued being does nothing whatsoever to assuage any of the pain society experiences as a consequence of his actions. And it does nothing to address the extraordinary cost those actions inflicted on the victim.

From a utilitarian, never mind a moral perspective, there is an imperative to punish this man. The only way to do that - and the only way to gain any semblance of justice and utility from the situation - is to inflict the maximum amount of pain on him. At least then we can in some way alleviate the mental anguish and suffering of society as a whole.

Then, my thoughts have shifted more pessimistic towards the Democrats, that they're just Republican-lite, that they don't care about voters - just their wallets, that they benefit either way of they lose or win because they keep getting richer, that they will never change because it benefits them. I'm 17 years old, and I've done my fair share of volunteering for the Democrats. I've written letters and sent them to swing states, I've done door knocking, I volunteered with a local organization to get people to vote for the Democrats. I used to be blue to the core, obsessed with the past accomplishments of the Democratic party. I was (and still kind of am) obsessed with the New Deal, obsessed with the Great Society because I truly believe in their policies and I still thought that there is some semblance of the New Deal in the modern Democratic Party. But now I think the ones at the top of the Democrats just don't care about progress or what's good for the people, just their careers. I believe if Harris won, she would have been infinitely better than the current elect, but that the current condition of the Democratic party would not allow the progressive ideal to bloom in America even if she got elected. I feel horribly apathetic at the current state of the Union and I severely hope to be proven wrong.",WattsAndThoughts,417,914,0.800000011920929,0.3056911883373621,1735624232,/r/changemyview/comments/1hq867d/cmv_i_dont_think_much_progressive_change_will/,2024,12
1hkwd3q,"CMV: The Democrats are not a ""right-wing"" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries.","This is something you here all the time on Reddit, and from people on the left generally, that the Democrats are actually a ""right-wing"" party on the international level and somehow their policies would be center right in other post-industrial democracies. People can arguable about the specifics of ""right-wing"" and ""left-wing"" so the more precise case I'm making is that the policy goals of the Democratic party are not out of step or somehow way further to the right compared to other mainstream, center-left parties in Europe or other Western democracies. If the policies of the Democratic party were transported to the United Kingdom or Germany, they would be much closer to Labour or the SPD and aren't going to suddenly fit right in with the Tories or the CDU. 

I will change my view if someone can read the [2024 Democratic platform](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FINAL-MASTER-PLATFORM.pdf) and tell me what specific policy proposals in there would not be generally supported by center-left parties in Europe or other Western democracies. 

In 2020, Biden ran on a platform that included promises like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, providing universal pre-k, making community college and public four year universities free, creating a public option for health insurance, among other things. Biden's primary legislative accomplishments were passing massive fiscal stimulus through the American Rescue Plan and infrastructure law and a major subsidies for green energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. He also expended a bunch of political capital on a plan for widespread student loan forgiveness that even other Democratic politicians conceded went beyond the scope of the Executive Branch's powers. I don't see how any of these things can be considered remotely right-wing. Even left-wing commentators like Ezra Klein at the New York Times have said that the Biden administration has been the most progressive administration ever in American history.

I think the assertion that Democrats are ""right-wing"" is mostly the result of people fundamentally misunderstanding the major differences between the American political system and the parliamentary systems practices in most other western democracies. The filibuster makes it so, that in practice, any major policy proposal requires bipartisan support. The last time the Democrats had a filibuster proof majority was back in 2009, which they promptly lost in like a year after a special election in Massachusetts. With their filibuster proof majority, the Democrats used it to pass the Affordable Care Act. Say what you will about the ACA, you can believe it didn't go far enough, but I don't really see how it be remotely construed as ""right-wing.""

Meanwhile, the majority party in most parliamentary systems is able to pass pretty much whatever they want with a 50%+1 majority, provided they can get their party/coalition in line. The logic people seem to employ when they argue that the Democrats are right-wing are they identify progressive policies that America doesn't have that other countries do have like single-payer healthcare, universal parental leave, etc and then reason backwards to conclude that the Democrats must be right-wing. But the Democrats explicitly call for many of these policies in their party platform, it's just virtually impossible to pass most of these things because of the Senate filibuster. 

As an additional note about healthcare, it's worth pointing out that many European countries do not have nationalized, single-payer systems use a mix of private and public healthcare options. The big examples are Germany and Switzerland. Even countries with single-payer systems like Canada still use private health insurance for prescription drugs and dental work. Just because the Democrats seem confused on whether they want to whole-heartedly embrace as Sanders style ""medicare for all"" isn't prima facia evidence that the party would somehow be right-wing in Europe. 

Finally, the Democratic party is arguably much further to the left on many social issues. One of the biggest examples is abortion. It's not clear what, if any, restrictions on abortion that Democratic party endorses. In states that have a Democratic trifecta in the governor's mansion and supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature, abortions are often effectively legal at any point, provided you can find a sympathetic doctor to provide a ""good-faith"" medical judgement that completing the pregnancy would harm the health of the mother. 

The viability standard set in Casey of around 24 weeks gave the US a significantly more generous timeframe to get an elective abortion, whereas most European countries cap it [around 12 weeks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1268439/legal-abortion-time-frames-in-europe/). Many European countries also require [mandatory counseling or waiting periods](https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/European-abortion-law-a-comparative-review.pdf) before women can get abortions, something the Democrats routinely object to. For comparison, the [position](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/europe/germany-abortion-recommendation-intl/index.html) of the Germany's former left-wing governing coalition was the abortions up until 12 weeks should be available on demand, provided the woman receives mandatory counseling and waits for three days. If a Republican state set up that standard in the US, the democrats would attack it relentlessly as excessively draconian, which is precisely what they've done to North Carolina, which has an extremely similar [abortion law](https://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/en/abortion-guide-access) on the books.",ThePurpleNavi,358,890,0.6100000143051147,0.2854252826126643,1734984967,/r/changemyview/comments/1hkwd3q/cmv_the_democrats_are_not_a_rightwing_party_and/,2024,12
1hedrsk,CMV: circumcision is child abuse,"I believe that it is child abuse to cut on the genitals of baby boys and that it should be illegal to cut on boys genitals 

The common counter arguments are religious freedom parental rights that cutting on boys genitals is medicine and the it’s legal argument 

I will address all the objections that I’m aware of 

1. As far as religious freedom I don’t believe religious freedom includes the “right” to carve your religion onto someone else’s body regardless of what holy book people quote the boy’s bodily autonomy and bodily integrity outweighs this

2. In regards to “parental rights” I don’t believe in the concept at all parents shouldn’t be allowed to do whatever they want to their children just cause “parental rights” if a parent produces child porn of thier kids they would rightfully be behind bars for their actions it wouldn’t matter if the parent who produced child porn used “parental rights” as a defense 

Likewise parents should be prohibited from being able to cut on the genitals of baby boys and people should be able to take their parents to court for having their genitals cut on without thier consent 

3. The most common “defense” for circumcision being “medicine” is the AAP statement which has been expired for years and the AAP did not renew the policy endorsing circumcision and when it was in effect the other pediatric organizations that weren’t in the United States condemned it as a culturally biased paper

And there’s an entire industry that makes billions of dollars from cutting on the genitals of baby boys and use them for biotech companies 

4. Just because it’s legal to cut on the genitals of baby boys does not mean people should do so slavery used to be a legal practice in the USA as well the fact that it’s legal only indicates who is in power not that it’s justified to cut on babies genitals

Not to mention anti cannabis laws did not stop people from advocating to legalize cannabis 

Anti abortion laws don’t stop people from advocating for legalizing abortion 

Pro abortion laws don’t stop people from advocating to make abortion illegal 

Likewise the fact that it’s legal to cut on the genitals of baby boys is not going to stop intactivists from advocating to make it illegal to cut on the genitals of baby boys and pressing for every single piece of legislation that makes it more difficult for circumcisions to happen such as defunding circumcision adding more burdens on the hospital so that they are like it’s not profitable anymore to cut on boys genitals etc.",flashliberty5467,440,773,0.6600000262260437,0.2807769799785779,1734213879,/r/changemyview/comments/1hedrsk/cmv_circumcision_is_child_abuse/,2024,12
1hk3zlc,CMV: Child Abuse is more tolerated from nonwhite families than it is from white ones.,"I know that there is plenty of abuse from white families here in western countries. However at least for the most part we as a society condemn it (Rightfully so) and see it as horrible parenting. However child-abuse is always talked about and condemned in terms of white parents. When it comes to parents from other countries and cultures, like Hispanics, Asians, and Indians just to name a few, it's talked about more casually and not condemned as much due to it being ""part of their culture"" (seriously look up videos and shorts on you-tube of people from other cultures casually joking about how their parents beat them and emotionally, and verbally abused them). I'm not trying to be ignorant or stereotype other people's culture but why are we so tolerant of abuse from nonwhite people, instead of condemning it. Also we see a good chunk of white people cut contact with their abusive parents when they reach adulthood (again rightfully so) however that rate is nowhere near the same with Minority kids as a good chunk of them I've seen online actually spend time, and act all friendly with their parents as if they forgot what they put them through and some of them even excuse it as ""they just showed their love in a different way"". This baffles and horrifies me to say the least.

1h9o6wr,CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term.,"Before I present my case, I want to get two things out of the way. One, I am a Democrat who voted for Kamala Harris, so I would very much like to be wrong. Two, this analysis does not take into account the possibility that no future elections are held. While I'm not convinced US elections are over forever, half of Reddit seems to be. Anyway, here's why I believe the Democrats are fucked even if democracy remains intact.

The 2024 election should have been a lay-up for Kamala Harris. Biden and Trump were both historically unpopular nominees, so much so that a man changed his legal name to ""Literally Anybody Else"" and ran a joke campaign. Biden was replaced by Harris in July, leading to tons of enthusiasm and small-dollar donations on the Democratic side. The economy was (and is) doing considerably better than in most other countries, including wealthy European nations. Most importantly, her opponent was a senile old man whose inaction led to the deaths of over a million people in the United States alone, was the only head of state to deny climate change, and tried to overthrow the government on his way out. Despite having the easiest possible set of circumstances with which to win a presidential election, *she still lost.*

Furthermore, rural voters are never going to vote for Democrats again. Local media, commonly cited as an antidote to polarization, has shriveled up, to be replaced by right-wing talk radio. Now, if Democrats could lose those areas by 30 points instead of 50 points, that would go a long way in the swing states. However, they don't just need swing states to remain viable as a national party (more on that later). Additionally, the 2024 election saw urban centers, people of color, and many other demographics that traditionally vote for Democrats swing violently rightward. As a 24-year-old man myself, I'm shocked but not surprised that Trump outright won men under 30. And I don't think they're coming back, because the Democrats won't embrace alternative media - there will never be a left-wing Joe Rogan. If the Democrats can't make up ground in rural areas, but also lose core parts of their base, they are doomed.

The situation is even more dire in the Senate, especially important because the Senate is the only chamber that can confirm or block nominees to the judiciary. Even with a 47-seat minority, the Democrats will still control both seats in several states that voted for Trump in this election. This includes both Arizona seats in a state Trump won by more than 5 percentage points. In other words, the Democrats are far more likely to lose Senate seats than to gain them in the long term. Even in the short term, the Democrats have just two pick-up opportunities in 2026 Senate - North Carolina (which has remained elusive for Democrats at the federal level since 2008!) and Maine (in which the unbeatable Susan Collins is likely to run again). Even if the Democrats can elect a President, they can only do so much without the Senate on their side, and if the judiciary gets right-wing enough, they will start green-lighting even more egregious voter suppression than we've already seen, which will eventually make it virtually impossible for Democrats to win again.

Finally, let's look at the media. In a craven display of anticipatory obedience, the Washington Post infamously did not endorse Kamala Harris this year. To make matters worse, MSNBC's Morning Joe (the channel of choice for the #Resistance) is already sucking up to Trump because they fear he'll try to shut them down. Trump would be foolish to shut them down, of course, because they're perhaps more responsible than anyone else for him returning to power. But in the period between the 2016 election and Trump's inauguration, I remember there being a lot more protests among both Democratic lawmakers and Democratic civilians than I see this time. That could partly be because the Kyle Rittenhouse precedent allows white vigilantes to murder protestors and get away with it, in which case I don't blame people for being too scared to protest. But the Democrats seem demoralized rather than angry, which is why I don't think they will engage in the necessary activism to resist Trump's worst policies.

2. This industry results in the preventable deaths of tens of thousands of people every year. 

Therefore, he is directly responsible for the death of tens of thousands of Americans each year. Wanting to see vigilantism against him is at least reasonable at most justifiable.

1hcxwer,CMV: Reddit's male spaces are completely broken and no longer represent men at all.,"I genuinely want someone to try change my mind on this because it's such a disparaging thought.

I've recently had a bit of an experience in r/askmenadvice that really irked me. I have found myself on the receiving end of the bullshit and seen some things I really don't like about collective male behaviour on Reddit.

Here's an example thread (on mobile so I'll edit with the link in a sec.

I have literally just been trying to argue my point that these spaces are public despite having 'men' in the name, and that we should be kinder and more considerate. There are 1000+ people reading even 0 upvote posts, who may be damaged by the casual women bashing that is so common, and many people have admitted to me that women should expect. They are extremely unlikely to participate because of the backlash.

These loud few boys do not take any accountability for how their actions affect other people. I do not care how old they are, they are simply not emotionally men yet if that's how they think. I appreciate that they are hurting, but choosing not to grow up has never been and will never be a successful strategy for coping with the real world.

In my opinion, men take responsibility. This is true for every happily married man I know IRL.

Approx 95% of the 'men' I've interacted with in these spaces are telling me the following:

1. I'm too angry/emotional with my argument - which implies my opinion as a man is invalid (feeling my emotions does not scare me now I've sought therapy)
2. That vulnerable people should not access these spaces if they can't handle it (that doesn't change that they still will)

Particularly concerning is that the sub descriptions openly have rules like 'be nice' and say that men are keen to open up their feminine side.

Staying cold and distant ain't the way to do it. Becoming a man for me has been all about understanding my emotions and exercising them helpfully.

Things that will CMV:

- Examples of reddit male spaces that aren't like this
- Genuine discussion of where my cognitive dissonance may lie on the matter

Things that will not CMV:

- Being told I am being dramatic/too angry/emotional about this. I feel very passionately about this and I will not censor myself when I've just expressed an opinion that I feel most men IRL share with me.
- Being told that's just the way it is, and I should ignore it. I believe that men can moderate ourselves and take responsibility better.

From my perspective, while I appreciate people need to vent to heal, Male Reddit is making things much, much worse. It's actually become a barrier to proper growth for anyone who interacts with them regularly and thinks it's normal.

So please CMV, because I am clearly hurting about this in the dark somewhat and I'd like to see the light.",ponderous_pete,352,623,0.6100000143051147,0.2256255123984014,1734044275,/r/changemyview/comments/1hcxwer/cmv_reddits_male_spaces_are_completely_broken_and/,2024,12
1hhai1y,CMV: No amount of gun violence deaths will result in political change and people should stop expecting it,"Every time there' is a major mass casualty incident in the United States caused by a firearm you constantly see people saying that it will be a ""Wakeup call"" and that it will somehow inspire change.

You can change my view if you convince me that people don't say that or don't believe it.

My view is that there is no specific amount of people that have to die in order to inspire meaningful change or legislation. Even after the Mandalay Bay Massacre in Las Vegas when 59 people were killed and more than 500 others injured, nothing happened.

You can change my view if you can convince me that there is a certain number that would inspire change.

The people who have the ability to make change simply don't care. They could put the effort in, but the deaths of everyday Americans does not justify that effort for them. They will continue to get elected no matter what, so they don't bother. Why hurt their political career when they could just sit in office and focus on other issues. Of course there are other important issues, so they can go handle those instead.

You can change my view if you can convince me that they do care. 

The people who have the ability to make a change will never be in danger of being impacted by gun violence. Politicians at high levels are protected, and at low levels usually come from privileged positions and will never face the threat of gun violence. They might deeply care about the issue, of have loved ones affected, but they themselves will never face that danger or experience fear of gun violence so they simply won't act. It doesn't apply to them. 

You can change my view if you can convince me that gun violence does impact politicians.

To conclude, no amount of dead Americans will inspire meaningful change. No amount of dead kids will make the politicians care. No amount of blood will make them act, unless of course it's blood of their own.

1hezsg8,CMV: Misandry isn’t Feminism,"This is something that in recent years both me and feminist friends find bothersome within the movement, and getting out of hand.

With the number of Feminism support declining, and people hating on Feminism, as well as Feminists exiting the movement, many couldn’t help but think where and how it went wrong.

Feminism is a movement that used to be about Women rights, but it never truly meant hating on men or becoming the same oppressive monsters “who think they know better for both sexes” as men once used to be towards women, making women not having the right to vote, etc. etc.

Feminism as it went forward after those past achievements, was all about one thing: Opposing PATRIARCHY and it’s rules or teachings, introducing instead more loving and empathetic ones instead. Not opposing men. Understanding that both men and women suffer under it, and wanting to free humanity from it.

But yet despite the benevolence in that… Feminism faced an insane amount of hate and opposition all over the world, and if you listen to the reasons why, you wouldn’t be surprised.

That’s when it dawned on me.

*The public hates Misandrists. Not Feminists.*

It is likely that despite the benevolence of Feminism, a population of Misandrist saw Feminism as an “excuse” to spread Misandry equal to the level of toxicity of the patriarchy and Misogyny.
Possibly turning into the very same monsters that real Feminism tried to liberate women from, except this time focusing on men.

In that sense, Misandry paints Feminism the bad image that many people all over the world sadly mistake it for. 

Instead of being a movement on love, equality, and liberation, the hatred that Patriarchy-induced Misandry brings into such “Feminism” brings the movement unironically closer towards the Patriarchy and it’s teachings, than against it.

Feminism is about gender equality. Empathy, not tyranny. Harmony and love for all, not hate.

I would rather call this type of Feminism the “Matriarchy”, which reflects more traits and behaviors in common with the toxicity of the Patriarchy. 
Rather than Feminism.",DittoBurrito123,217,653,0.6899999976158142,0.1977867279725111,1734289787,/r/changemyview/comments/1hezsg8/cmv_misandry_isnt_feminism/,2024,12

However, a few years ago, post-2020, I had the idea of a *Four Year Force* Program as a possible win-win for police reform advocacy.

The basic idea is it’d be a kind of GI Bill for people looking to join the police force (ie a free ride). 

There’d be a standardized, baseline federal curriculum for aspiring police officers, which would include:
- firearms discipline
- physical fitness benchmarks
- deescalation and negotiation training, and 
- civil rights 101

It’d also be part of an ordinary bachelor’s degree, so they’d be among other students and not separate from the population they might one day serve. Officers looking to join SWAT or similar would need 2 years of additional training.

They are pretty much exploited by default. Immigrants on work visas are already exploited enough.

Every single study I have read on the matter says that illegal immigration provides a net benefit to the economy, but the ones that go into the details find that it's the wealthy people that receive the benefit by exploiting the workers more. The working class is generally negatively impacted by this, even if the economy does better overall

There is, at the same time, no real benefit we provide the world on a meaningful scale by accepting refugees. There are specific, local scenarios where we can absolutely have a meaningful impact by accepting refugees. 

The best example of this has been how we accept Haitians. There's been general bipartisan support for accepting these people as refugees, and even Trump extended the protections first doled out by Obama after the earthquake

However, when everyone tries to claim asylum, the alternative means of entering the US that was necessary for these Haitians after their airport was shut down was made not viable. 

The only people who truly benefit off of Illegal immigration are the wealthy that exploit them for their labor

I hate the idea that we profit off the exploitation of a lower class of people

I'm open to all sorts of immigration reform but I do not wish to engage on the subject of opening up more legal avenues for immigration",Particular-Pen-4789,271,567,0.6600000262260437,0.19277208897115183,1735253390,/r/changemyview/comments/1hn0ahj/cmv_proillegal_immigration_sentiments_are/,2024,12

1h671rd,CMV: it’s not “disrespectful” or bigoted to incorrectly eat or prepare ethnic food under most circumstances,"So, let me start by saying that I do get where the other side of this issue is coming from. I’m Greek American. People incorrectly eat our food quite often. From putting dill in tzatziki (maybe some Greeks do that but no Greek owned restaurant I’ve ever been to has, nor has my family or any family I know and have eaten with), to honey mustard chicken gyros, and more. I find it annoying. However, that doesn’t mean I have a right to tell other people how they want to eat food on their plate.

If someone wants to eat a honey mustard chicken gyro or put dill in their tzatziki, go for it. Who am I to judge? If you enjoy your food, that’s what matters most.

That being said, I can see some exceptions to this. For example, if a friend is trying to introduce you to their culture through food, I’d recommend eating and preparing the food how it’s meant to be eaten and prepared. That being said, that isn’t really about cultural respect as much as it is about respecting your friend.

The other argument for the other side that I’ve heard is that there are reasons why food is prepared certain ways in certain cultures, normally for health and practical reasons. And, I get that. But, I’d argue that as long as you’re not really harming anyone, it’s fine.

I guess there’s also the argument that the food item comes from a culture consisting of people of color or oppressed groups. In which case, it’s harder for me to speak on that because I am white. But, I’d again argue that there isn’t really any harm done? If anyone has a different perspective, feel free to share it.

1hfn4kf,Cmv: Trying to be manly is ironically very unmanly,"This is a specific type of person. Guys who try desperately to be manly “alpha” men, who are very insecure about how others see them and become very emotional if anyone dares think they are not mr macho man are ironically very unmanly. They cannot do something which they consider “feminine” because they are manly men what if someone sees them. They are slaves to gender stereotypes and society. They have to try to look as “manly” as possible and anyone who does not look like that is automatically less of a man to them. What is manly is obviously not always universally defined, but going off gender stereotypes, i feel that caring so hard about being manly is not very manly. It is also the same kind of guy who is always becoming so angry at everything and yet says that men are not emotional as if anger is not an emotion. 

I feel as if being brave enough to truly be your authentic self in the world without trying to be manly and just being who you are is what is actually manly. You do whatever you want it does not matter if someone else might think it is not masculine, who cares.

1hjhtug,CMV: The 2020s has been and will be viewed as a terrible decade ,"My overall feelings on the 2020s decade will be no more or less different from the majority of people when I say that of all the decades that has transpired throughout modern time, this decade has, by far, been a consistent disaster, one after another, with a general pessimistic vibe that even in future retrospects, it will be objectively viewed as an unlikable era that will never be looked back at fondly. I will admit that despite the past decades' major downsides, they are viewed much more favorably based on various statements, regardless of the age group – from the amount of analysis I had conducted in my research, it is immensely rare to hear about how decades such as the 1980s and the 1990s are viewed negatively in the same vein as the 2020s; the disdain for the latter couldn't be more overstated as I had underwent personal struggles with anxiety and depression from recent current events. Even when I struggled from my mental disability in my childhood, I still viewed the past rather fondly. Granted, there is a theoretical chance that I could be just viewing the past with 'rose-tinted glasses', I find it to be practically impossible to imagine the 2020s to be viewed so fondly in retrospects given the overly negative reception with many past events in comparison.

So far, the 2020s decade has given people the pandemic and its after-effects within society, political unrest along with radical polarization, increased social isolation leading to depression and increased risks of suicide, the gradual erosion of democracy with cases such as Afghanistan and Myanmar, inflation along with massive corporate consolidation over housing, multiple genocides and wars, the countless mass shootings happening within the United States, skyrocketing cost of living, the increasing gap of wealth gap inequality, erosion of certain rights such as abortion, greenhouse gas emissions have increased global average temperatures, and that’s only to list a few. I understand that horrible events in the past have happened as well - it's just that so much bad has happened from this decade alone that it seems to make the events of the past pale in comparison.  I just find that the world, let alone this decade, is seemingly bleak and will not be looked back at admirably with the exception of the young adolescents and individuals that have been raised in a high class privileged lifestyle.

Ideally, there is testimony from research groups backed up by data that society as a whole is supposedly better off than before from the decrease of extreme poverty, fewer people dying in conflicts in recent decades than in most of the 20th century, the ever-advancing medical treatments against fatal illnesses, increased life expectancy along with decreased child mortality rate; those aspects are taken for granted admittedly. However, the general vibe that I have felt recently is anything but positive – I noticed that people are generally depressed overall due to various factors that have been listed. I read that the same group of adults aged 18-35 in general will note that their time in certain past decades that they lived in at that time positively whereas another group of adults within the same age bracket will persistently state that the 2020s is a terrible time to be living in. Even from reading about older generations that have lived through certain rough times with the Great Depression, the World Wars, the looming threat of the Cold War, segregation, apartheid, communism with Eastern Europe, the Vietnam War, the AIDS epidemic that those periods of time, they would state that this time of era is even worse than they they lived through which really puts the 2020s in such a negative light.

To put it in layman's terms, I am filled with confidence that the 2020s is generally despised now and that it will never be - this decade's overall vibe and reception will be no different than the 1930s.

1hp76ya,"CMV: Eating meat is a natural part of the food chain, and humans are fulfilling their role in nature by doing so.","The food chain is one of the most fundamental principles of nature, and every living creature plays a role in it. Lions eat meat, tigers eat meat, eagles eat meat, and humans eat meat too. This process is not a deviation from nature but an essential part of it. Just as lions hunt gazelles or eagles catch fish, humans consume both plants and animals to sustain themselves.

I believe humans were created by God with the ability to eat meat, and this is reflected in how we are designed. Our bodies, with teeth suited for both grinding plants and tearing meat, and digestive systems capable of processing a wide variety of foods, clearly show that eating both plants and animals is natural for us. From the earliest days of humanity, people hunted and ate meat as part of their survival. Over time, this relationship with meat became a cornerstone of human life, providing essential nutrients and energy.

Some might argue that humans have the choice not to eat meat, but I don’t think avoiding meat is a more ethical decision. Eating meat is neither unethical nor unnatural—it is simply a part of how God created us to live. Just as lions and eagles follow their instincts to eat meat, humans are also fulfilling their natural role by doing the same. Saying that humans should stop eating meat because we can is, in my opinion, like suggesting lions should stop hunting because they might adapt to eating plants.

This analogy also helps illustrate the deeper point: all creatures are part of a cycle. Sheep eat grass, humans eat sheep, and the energy continues to flow through the natural world. This interconnected system is how the world was created to function, and humans are not exempt from it. Participating in this cycle is not only natural but essential for balance.

I see no conflict between eating meat and being part of the natural world. We are creatures like any other, placed on Earth to live according to the system God created. It is no more unnatural for humans to eat meat than it is for a bird of prey to catch a rabbit. This is not a question of morality but of nature and design.

I understand that some may have personal reasons for choosing not to eat meat, but I do not believe this makes them morally superior. Just as a lion is not “wrong” for eating a gazelle, humans are not “wrong” for eating animals. It’s simply the way life works.

I’m curious to hear other perspectives and see if anyone can offer arguments that might change my view. Can someone help me see this differently?",ZookeepergameFit2918,144,581,0.6000000238418579,0.16347907702358316,1735509905,/r/changemyview/comments/1hp76ya/cmv_eating_meat_is_a_natural_part_of_the_food/,2024,12

1hpuw7y,"CMV: ""YYYY-MM-DD"" is a superior date format to ""DD-MM-YYYY""","You may have seen [this meme](https://imgur.com/5dYgqoE.png) before, explaining why the ""DD-MM-YYYY"" date format (commonly used in America) is superior to the ""MM-DD-YYYY"" format (commonly used in the US).  However, I think that it misses the mark a lot, and both of those formats are inferior to one that puts the year first, then the month, then the date (e.g. ""2024-12-30"")

I think this format is better than the other two for a few reasons:

* It matches how people normally express numbers.  Typically we express numbers in a way that is [Big Endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness); we say the largest magnitude part of the number first, then descending down to the smallest part.  For example, if you want to write the number five million and one, you would write it as 5,000,001.  You start with the ""5"" (which has the biggest magnitude, since it counts millions) and end with the ""1"" (since it has the smallest magnitude and counts ones).  The DD-MM-YYYY date format flips this (kind of, see below) and starts with the smallest magnitude and goes to the largest.

* When I said it flips it, that's only kind of true.  The numbers are still big-endian for each individual part of the date.  For example, writing the current year as ""2024"" is big-endian.  It starts with the 2 (which represents thousands of years, the largest magnitude piece of information), followed by the ""0"" for hundreds, the next ""2"" for tens, and then the ""4"" for ones.  It's big-endian, descending magnitude.  And the month and date parts are also big-endian.  So when you write with DD-MM-YYYY, you don't really end up with a big-endian or small-endian date format.  It's a small-endian collection of individual date parts which are themselves big-endian, resulting in a mixed-endian result where the magnitudes go up and down (much like the pyramid on the right side of the meme posted at the top).

* If you add in time-of-day, it becomes even more clear that you're going up and down in terms of magnitude.  We write time of day in HH:MM:SS format.  As far as I know, there's no country where SS:MM:HH is preferred.  This is big-endian, starting with the largest magnitude and then moving down from there.  If you list the date in ""DD-MM-YYYY"" format, and include the time, then you're always going to have a format where it goes up and down.  Either ""HH:MM:SS DD-MM-YYYY"" or ""DD-MM-YY HH:MM:SS""  Both of these are ""out of order pyramids"" in the illustration above.

* ""YYYY-MM-DD"" also has the nice advantage in the fact that, if you sort filenames or other pieces of data in a simple alphanumeric way, then you are also putting them in chronological order.  The other two date formats don't have this.

Ultimately, the only advantage that I can think of that DD-MM-YYYY has over YYYY-MM-DD is ""but it's what some people are already used to, so why change?"", which is incidentally the exact same reason people choose MM-DD-YYYY over DD-MM-YYYY.   

So change my view.",kabukistar,356,292,0.7699999809265137,0.15440516424210177,1735586042,/r/changemyview/comments/1hpuw7y/cmv_yyyymmdd_is_a_superior_date_format_to_ddmmyyyy/,2024,12

Lil Segway below:


Sadly, I reached this conclusion when I became overweight. I was on meds and had deep depression so I ballooned from a solid 160 to 200 in the span of 4 to 5 years. To see the treatment I am receiving is jarring. I went from eating what I want to people micromanaging my food intake. I'll never forget when I got over a weight plateau and celebrated (lost 10 lbs) only for someone to come in and call me fat within hours and how I need to lose weight. Then for me to finally fit in a dress that I couldn't wear for over a year and still be told, ""You need to stop eating so much, you need to start exercising."" The ironic thing is that I was, which is why I could fit in more clothes lmfao. 

I've actively been eating less and spacing out my meals. My one dinner has become dinner for night one and night two. My breakfast has been spread out where half is breakfast and the other half is lunch. I do struggle with eating late because tbh I never finish my meals throughout the day, yet because I have a belly, I'm dragged for it. Plus it made me realize that people don't know what weight looks like. I've weighed myself before family dinners and I am the same exact weight as when I saw them months ago. Yet I walk in the door and people are yelling at me that I got fatter and need to stop eating.

1hfv9u7,CMV: Ukraine is probably headed for a defeat in the Russo-Ukrainian war,"I've been following the war in Ukraine since the Russian military buildup in 2021, and at this point I think Ukraines odds of winning are slim to none.
Ukraine's strategy in the past year or so has hinged on defending fortified cities like Vuhledar and attriting the Russian forces to create a bloody stalemate, after which Ukraine could build up their forces to match or potentially outmatch Russian forces. However, they've been consistently driven out of their fortified cities, with Avdivka and Torersk being some of the most notable instances of this. Ukrainian defense near Pokrovsk are currently struggling under the Russian offensive, and if Pokrovsk falls, Ukraine has no fortified position behind that for quite a distance, forcing them to either give up large chunks of land or defend open and unfortified ground.

The AFU is not in great shape either. Their premier units, like the 47th Mechanized, have been whittled down to a shell of their former selves as attrition takes a major toll on them. Their rank and file is not doing much better, as many of their units around Pokrovsk are at less than 40% strength according to Pravda UA: https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/articles/2024/09/17/7475408/#

The Russian military, meanwhile, has a formidable artillery advantage and has begun catching up to Ukraine in the quantity and quality of FPV drones they’ve been using. Incentivized by large cash bonuses and salaries, Russian volunteers are currently signing up in huge numbers, ensuring that addition does not decimate the Russian army. While the Russian economy is struggling, there is no indication that anybody in the Kremlin is considering ending the war due to the economy. Countries rarely end wars due to economic pressure in the first place. For example, both World Wars bankrupted the British Empire entirely, but they never surrendered until all of their objectives had been achieved. In fact, among Russia’s political elite, the main complaint has been that Putin has not mobilized the economy and populace more. If you remember the Wagner revolt, Prigozhins complaint was that Putin was not producing enough ammunition to fuel the war effort. 

So based on what I’ve said above, I think Ukraine cannot reclaim their occupied territories, and I think their situation is likely to worsen. I also believe Russia is not going to simply give up and go home, as the Russian political elite are in lockstep around supporting the war.

1hcv5d3,CMV: Apple removing the headphone jack was an anti-consumer decision.,"I’ve heard the argument of how they “needed to” so they can improve phones at a larger rate but to me while it does serve some benefit, it’s timing makes it hard to believe it has nothing to do with selling more airpods. I don’t believe that the room for improvement increases at a rate that justifies removing this feature and the precedence it set has made phones far more inconvenient. I’ve also heard the argument that wired headphones were being phased out which I geniunely find largely untrue. Bluetooth headphones, while you can still find cheaper bluetooth headphones wired headphones are STILL significantly cheaper with some being at the $1-5 dollar range.

1hgjslt,CMV: There is nothing wrong in seeking escorts if you can't get laid,"Lots of conventionally unattractive or socially awkward men nowadays struggle to get female attention all their lives and it can continue well into late 20s. Dating apps have made things worse and further ruins their already fragile confidence. I myself have faced this and know quite a few people who do so as well. It stings when you do a lot to improve yourself, dress well but barely make any actual progress while someone with a jawline and extra few inches (vertical, not horizontal) get attention even while wearing a potato sack and looking like they haven't shaved in years.

People will say you have a shitty attitude, try to put the blame on you, call you insecure but dont believe everything they say. Nonetheless, the only way to let go of this bitterness is to accept that most women are spoilt for choices nowadays (again, fault of men only for being down to fuck anyone with a pulse) and they have a right to set  their standards, even ones who you think are conventionally unattractive themselves. There is nothing wrong if she chooses who she wants from her options. You are not entitled to affection or sex or anything really. Women don't owe you a thing.

Now coming to escort services, it is a perfectly valid alternative if you have enough money to spare. Best is to go for independent escorts only, without any middleman involved. No one should be shamed for entering into such a transactional relationship. The only concerned parties are you and the woman. Its completely understandable if you don't want to deprived of any sexual contact throughout your 20s (or more, god forbid) for reasons beyond your control and you feel these services are the only option left.

Trust me, you will feel better and lead a better life as long you don't get carried away. Its far better than letting bitterness and despair consume you. Do what's best for you. Try not get swayed by people (irl or online) who try to convince you that you are a bad person or misogynist or whatever for engaging in such practices. They are not in your shoes. Your life is not the same as them. They don't care if you remain a virgin. You are not guaranteed to be ""rewarded"" with anything if you go about things the ""right"" way, whatever that is. Women get attracted to whoever they want, which includes criminals and abusers. You can be the best version of yourself and it still doesn't guarantee you will get laid. Life simply doesn't work like that.

Life is unfair. Always think about what's best for yourself. So go out there, spend that dough and get laid guilt free and don't let any moral police get to you.",sayantaneden10,229,342,0.7200000286102295,0.1329689833726649,1734466768,/r/changemyview/comments/1hgjslt/cmv_there_is_nothing_wrong_in_seeking_escorts_if/,2024,12
1hbc4s8,"CMV: Folks who refuse to tip on ""principle"" are just throwing a tantrum aimed at the wrong group.","I understand folks refusing to tip at places like Starbucks or McDonalds where the employee is not a tipped wage earner, but I hate folks when refuse to tip even at restaurants or for delivery where it is actually expected. The system sucks, but stiffing the worker who provided you a service is just taking your frustrations out on the exploited party. If you really want to send a message, don't use those delivery platforms or frequent those restaurants that rely on tipped wage earners and vote with your dollars.

Folks act like tipping is just peer pressure from the worker when in actuality tips exist to bridge the gap between the tipped wage and minimum wage. Obviously none of us made that decision, but it is the way that the system is currently constructed. Folks who refuse to tip tipped wage earners are just throwing a tantrum over this lack of control. There are actual constructive actions you can take to change the status quo, call your representative, organize with workers rights advocates, boycott restaurant owners, but stiffing the employee just puts that person in danger of wage theft for no fault of their own, especially if they are an immigrant or lack the time/resources to pursue legal action.

For the folks saying that tipping has gotten out of control and they don't want to tip every time they make a purchase are right, so don't. Oh you feel pressured because the check out person flipped the screen around for you? Grow a backbone, hit skip, and turn it back. You are not obligated to tip everyone, but there are certain people you are obligated to tip if you receive a service from them and you should absent some extenuating circumstances.

And yes, tipping is a way for restaurants to pass costs off to the consumer. But do you really think the price of the food on the menu would remain the same if the worker received the actual minimum wage. The price you pay for food is lower because restaurants don't have to account as much for employee wage when crafting the menu. If they did, the price would increase and these same folks complaining about tipping culture would start complaining about unaffordability. Paying for services is not cheap, paying for a persons time and efforts is not cheap. It sucks that certain activities may not be cost effective for everyone, but that is the nature of discretionary spending. You can either play by the rules and try to change them if you are so inclined, or stay home and cook for yourself. Its really not so bad.",smokey2916,89,504,0.5799999833106995,0.1326650186903814,1733864368,/r/changemyview/comments/1hbc4s8/cmv_folks_who_refuse_to_tip_on_principle_are_just/,2024,12
