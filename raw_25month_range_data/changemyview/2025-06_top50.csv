1l9r3wh,CMV: There is no practical way for Israel to conduct operations against Hamas that Leftist/Progressive movements will find acceptable,"I am defining “Leftist & / or Progressives movements” as the dominating, majority attitudes and narratives of the leftist & progressive movements in western countries in regards to Israel. An argument that “not all leftists think the same” will not win me over.

I do not believe there is a way for the nation of Israel to conduct operations against Hamas that Leftist and/or Progressives movements will find acceptable. I believe this for the following reasons:

https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/880818a.htm 

In the founding charter of Hamas, it states the organizations goals are to eliminate Israel and to eliminate Jews. The founding charter rejects peaceful solutions, and states this goal must be accomplished via any violence necessary.

To accomplish this goal, Hamas has used the following tactics: 

- Suicide Bombings
- Hostage Taking and Kidnappings of Israeli civilians and soldiers
- Indiscriminate Murder when present in Israeli territory 
- Continual Rocket Launches
-  Utilized Palestinian civilians as human shields
- stolen aid intended for Palestinians
- destroy infrastructure meant to provide resources to the Palestinians instead to reuse as weaponry 

These tactics all by themselves are atrocious. However, there is the added caveat that **Hamas is the ruling government of Gaza.** This means that Hamas is using **state resources** that functioning states would use to build infrastructure, feed the population, and develop the nation, Hamas instead divert in order to conduct their war effort against Israel.

When looking at the options that Israel has at its disposal to deal with Hamas, there are **no options available that Leftist/Progressives find acceptable.**

- To prevent suicide bombings and the indiscriminate murder and kidnapping of its citizens, Israel has erected checkpoints and a border wall with the Gaza Strip. But this contributes to leftist and progressive arguments that Gaza is an “open air prison”.

- to prevent Hamas from acquiring advanced weaponry the Iron Dome would be unable to deflect and thus lead to the leveling of cities in Israel, Israel maintains a blockade of Gaza. Again, this has been met with cries from leftist and progressives that Gaza is an open air prison and stopping aid from getting through. 

- to prevent Hamas from continuing to launch rockets from a given location within Gaza territory, Israel exterminate the aggressor by liquidating the site with rocket fire. But because Hamas used human shields, Israel is met with accusations from leftists that Israel is targeting civilians with inevitably a hospital or school that is being used as a site to launch rockets ends up having civilian casualties. 

- to prevent Palestinians civilians from getting hurt in urban warfare, Israel has attempted to evacuate citizens from areas it plans to do these operations. But once again, Israel is met with accusations from leftists and progressives that Israel is trying to “deport/ethnically cleanse” Gaza.

I am making this post because Leftist and Progressives always are criticizing Israel in how it conducts itself against Hamas. These same groups, however, always fail to provide **practical alternatives** to how the state of Israel should conduct operations in away that guarantee its own safety as a nation while being deemed “morally / ethically acceptable.” I am open to hearing these suggestions, but so far no good answers have been provided.

If a blockade, border security, air strikes, evacuation zones, and military invasion are all unacceptable methods for dealing with Hamas and protecting itself **what solutions do Leftists and Progressives find acceptable**?

1l89jr4,CMV: The right only cares about “riots” when marginalized people protest something the government did.,"I’ve noticed a pattern: when protests happen in response to state violence—especially immigration raids, police brutality, or systemic injustice—the right calls them “riots,” zeroes in on a few looting videos, and dismisses the entire movement.

But when right-wingers protest (COVID lockdowns, school boards, January 6), they seem to expect nuance and understanding. Suddenly context matters.

Take the recent LA protests after mass ICE raids. The majority were peaceful, but a few people looted. Instead of separating protestors from criminals, many conservatives immediately lumped them together and accused “the left” of condoning lawlessness.

If you really care about law and order, why is the outrage so selective? Why do ICE raids that break up families not trigger the same passion as a smashed store window?

1lc3p4u,CMV: People who celebrate/justify civilian deaths in Israel (from the Iranian missiles) are just as bad as the people who celebrate/justify civilian deaths in Gaza,"I've seen so many comments across multiple subreddits justifying civilians deaths and the destruction of civilian homes in Israel.

If you spent the past 2 years (rightfully) criticizing Israel for the amount of civilian deaths in Gaza, but then turn around and start to justify or even celebrate the civilian deaths in Israel, that just makes you a massive hypocrite.

You are either against civilian deaths or you are not, you don't get to pick and choose based on what country we're talking about.

1l35ymt,"CMV: As a gay man, I believe the culture and attitudes pervasive in online female spaces judge men by extremely harsh standards they would find unacceptable if applied to themselves","Gunna get this out of the way before I continue: “Why was mentioning you are a gay man important?”

Because if I say I’m just a man, I’m going to assumed to be straight, and my opinion dismissed as when straight men normally express dissatisfaction with how they are treated and perceived in online female spaces.

With that out of the way-

I think women in online spaces dedicated to women view and treat men in ways that if they were treated themselves would be derided as unfair, immoral, cruel, and unacceptable. Men in these spaces, especially if it involved romance or dating, are judged very critically and harshly by many benign and superficial things, such as:

- the way they look

- the interest and hobbies they hold 

- the way they speak or act 

“But, but, you have to judge people by those things to make sure your compatibility.”

100% agree. 

The problem lies in the double standards.

A clear example that comes to mind is that it is totally acceptable in female spaces to judge a man for being under six foot. There’s a derogatory insult that is played off as just teasing- short kings. But if you judge a woman by her weight, it’s deemed as body shaming.

Men who like fishing get judged. But don’t dare insult women on the hobbies they like because that’s misogyny.

If an “unattractive” man shoots his shot with a girl, he’s laughed, called a troll, referred to as “that” and “it”. But if boys were to do the same to an unattractive girl they’d be called chauvinist bullies.

“Where do get the audacity to-“ is a common phrase, but if men generalize women they’re just continue  stereotypes of women.

“I can’t have my man be girly or feminine.” But if you judge a girl for having masculine interests you’re just continuing the patriarchy. 

Like…do straight men and women even want to date each other at this point? You guys sound so miserable 😭

1loiw06,CMV: Trump enacting Project 2025 was not left-wing fear mongering. It's now 42% complete.,"The project tracker is here, and cites each specific objective of Project 2025 and the Trump admin directive/policy that accomplishes it [https://www.project2025.observer/](https://www.project2025.observer/). The first year of his term is 6 months in, and they're getting close to being halfway through it already. A lot of it is has been through Trump's executive orders. 

When Project 2025 was all over the news, the main narrative from conservatives was that P2025 was just talk, it was just some weird policy fantasy from an alt-right group. Or they just stayed quiet. But a good amount of Republicans and Republican leaders said that Trump has nothing to do with it, they parroted him when he said he wasn't going to touch it, and any claims that Trump was going to do so was just far-left fear mongering. This is a quote from the [National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/project-2025-director-leaves-heritage-foundation-after-criticism-from-trump-democrats/) last July when the P2025 director stepped down

1lfbd1x,CMV: Israel settlers are terrorists and by extension Israel engages in State Sponsored Terrorism.,"A Terrorist is defined as: a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

The Settlements and the Settler movement are considered illegal under International Law. There is a well-documented mountain of evidence of Settlers using violence and intimidation (including but not limited to murder, rape and sexual violence, destruction of property, etc) against the Civilians of the West Bank and East Jerusalem with the goal of expelling the Palestinian natives and settling their lands as they believe the land was promised to them. Even the US Department of State has defied Settler Violence as Terrorism.

I define State Sponsored Terrorism as Terrorist violence that is carried out with the active support of national governments provided to violent non-state actors.

The Israeli government has been actively supporting Israeli settlements giving funding and giving subsidies to the settlers, arming the settlers, and even creating government sponsored programs to expand the illegal settlements. 

To change my view, please explain why the settlers should not be considered terrorists or that Israel should not be considered a sponsor of Settler led Terrorism ",paikiachu,2899,1747,0.6700000166893005,0.4248878505045943,1750341146,/r/changemyview/comments/1lfbd1x/cmv_israel_settlers_are_terrorists_and_by/,2025,6
1l38g9o,CMV: Calling all men predators is inherently sexist and puts off most men from wanting to understand your views.,"It is hard to engage in meaningful conversation with people from various popular subreddits when you already are being demonized as a predator under a generalized view of men. I don't want people to think I am saying that all men are perfect or anything. 

In fact far from it, an estimated 91% of victims of rape & sexual assault are female and 9% male. **Nearly 99%** of perpetrators are male. 

Anything even close to this statistic is insane and horrendous but to even pretend that a majority of men are predators is ridiculous and will just push people further away from understanding your position completely. 

Even the men who got SA'd by other men would be considered predators...

Also, you really think calling out all men for being predators is really going to make any kind of systematic change? You think the men that are predators even care that you call ""all men"" predators? 

I think if anything you are likely enabling them to be predators because now there literally is no difference between a non-predator man and a predator man because they are all predators.

Maybe people are more nuanced than I give them credit for and they don't actually think all men are predators and its just something to say in general to cope with the heinous crimes in this world but I think if you actually want to fix that inequality you wouldn't perpetuate gender stereotypes and making people feel bad for doing nothing and would instead try to have meaningful conversation and understanding. Not in a patronizing educational way but more having a clear understanding of what we can do as people to make sure everyone is safe because it seems like predators have tricks they use to try to isolate their victims etc.. and men can be a little bit socially inept so knowing when women need help when its less obvious is key I think.

This is also not exclusively women spaces or something before you think I am going into women's only subreddits and criticizing them for what they want to say to each other. 

TLDR: I don't think saying ""all"" for any group of people is really correct ESPECIALLY when its not even being used as a shorthand to refer to a majority. It just further distances understanding between men and women and leads more men to be burnt out or increasingly apathetic towards these issues and not think its even a problem when it seriously is a problem.

1ljmah1,CMV: The “work is slavery” and anti-work mindset is disconnected from reality,"I’ve seen a growing number of people who claim that humans weren’t meant to work and that we should just enjoy life and reject the 9 to 5. On here, Tiktok, Twitter, it’s like some sort of revolution of lethargic, lazy people. But their perspective ignores something fundamental. Everything they enjoy in life exists because other people do work.

The vacations they post about, the restaurants they eat at, the games they play, the clean water they drink, all of it is made possible by people who show up to jobs every day. Infrastructure, technology, public services, even the internet they use to complain, all depend on a functioning workforce.

It’s not just naïve. It is hypocritical. Especially when some of these same people push for socialist or communist systems where the idea is to redistribute the results of other people’s effort while avoiding responsibility themselves. It is not about fairness. It is about avoiding work and expecting others to pick up the slack.

You do not have to love your job. But pretending that work is inherently evil while relying entirely on the labor of others is not some enlightened view. It is entitled. Also, for those that are saying we shouldn’t work 40 hours a week, you are piled into this. Don’t expect higher wages for less work, it’s asinine thinking.

1lkchul,"CMV: I’m left-leaning, but the way the left treats the middle class is becoming alienating","I’ve always leaned left: supporting unions, progressive taxation, and public investment. But I’ve started to feel alienated by a growing tone of hostility toward the middle class, especially online and in activist spaces.

I don’t own a home. I rent, I work full-time, and I’m managing student debt and rising living costs. Still, I’ve noticed people in my income bracket (~$80K–$200K) increasingly framed as part of the problem. The middle class is now being accused of upholding unjust systems or being too comfortable to care. Just having a stable salary seems to invite blame.

I fully support holding the ultra-wealthy and corporations accountable. But when the frustration extends to people just trying to stay afloat, it feels less like solidarity and more like resentment. I want to believe in a left that builds coalitions across class - not one that turns on people who aren’t struggling “enough.”

1lb86kj,CMV: Israel attacking Iran makes perfect sense.,"Iran built its entire Israel strategy around a network of proxy states and paramilitary groups. They spent tens of billions of dollars arming Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis and supporting Bashar Al Asads regime in Syria. 

The goal of this investment was to encircle Israel and grant Iran the ability to threaten Israel on multiple fronts while protecting Iranian territory. 

This strategy failed big time and faster than anyone could imagine. 

In less than two years, Israel has nearly annihilated Hamas, decapitated Hezbollah, precipitated the fall of Asad’s Syria, and is perfectly capable of handling the Houthis who turned to be more of a nuisance than a threat. 

Iran is now alone, reasonably broke, and at its weakest. 

Israel is winning on all fronts and has retained the military support of all its allies. Add to this the potential alignment of the entire Levantine region with Saudi Arabia. 

It makes absolute sense to strongly and aggressively attack Iran right now. This is the closest to the regime falling Iran has probably ever been, and the weakest militarily.

1ldyb9e,"CMV: Hasan Piker isn’t a good representative of the left-wing because of his uncritical amplification of extremist talking points, selective bias, and toxic on-air behavior","Hey everyone,

I’ve been not followed Hasan for a long time. I have recently started watching his videos. I agree with him on mostly all US politics. I respect this role as a critical and popular voice against trump. But recently there has been a search for the face of left wing media (a Joe Rogan figure) and many people believe Hasan fits this bill. I frankly strongly disagree.Here’s why:

1. Platforming Extremist Narratives

a. He’s hosted a self-described “Houthi pirate” who openly celebrated hijacking a commercial vessel for the Houthis (a U.S.-designated terrorist group) and largely praised that action as resistance.

b. On multiple occasions he’s given airtime to pro-Hamas or pro-Hezbollah talking points—labeling them “resistance”—without clearly calling out the atrocities those groups commit.
Any right wing figure will be rightly called out for such behaviour. 

2. Selective Criticism & Unacknowledged Bias

a. Hasan fiercely defends Muslims against Islamophobia but has never publicly criticized any Islamic organizations (even those linked to radical violence).
b. He’s quick to call out Christian nationalism yet seems unwilling to hold similar standards for an Islamist or extremist-linked institutions—suggesting a religious or identity-based double standard.

For someone to be the face of diverse left wing they need to call out all extremists.
 
3. Journalistic Oversight & “Bad Journalism”
a. In a segment on a recent Kashmir terror attack, he invited a guest who downplayed the murder of Hindu tourists and refused to acknowledge known facts from multiple credible sources —yet Hasan didn’t  challenged
 those claims and just platformed his views.

b. He often frames news as raw “takes” rather than rigorous, sourced analysis, letting guests push one-sided narratives uncorrected.

4. Toxic On-Air Persona
a. I don’t find his style of masculinity healthy. It’s not better if a left wing man is shouting and showing off his alpha masculinity.

5. Is He Unique?
No. Sure, he does left-wing commentary on Twitch and reaches millions, but dozens of other commentators do the same without normalizing extremist violence or dog-whistling to their base.

My Position:
I believe a credible left-wing media figure should platform all sides responsibly, call out extremist ideology—regardless of religion or politics—provide context and fact-checks in real time, and model respectful, non-toxic discourse. Hasan Piker fails on these fronts often enough that I can’t see him as a good representative of progressive values.

CMV: I’m open to the possibility that I’m being too harsh or missing broader context. As I said I just started watching him recently so what I have written is based on the videos I watched , Reddit threads (pro and anti) and factchecking with Chat GPT. I have done my due diligence without watching all his videos as frankly I don’t want to give my time to that. What am I overlooking? Are there examples where Hasan has consistently held all extremists to account, or moments where he’s moderated extremist guests rigorously? How do you reconcile his faults with any unique value he brings?",aloo-ka-paratha,1069,1839,0.6399999856948853,0.3000063152696663,1750192966,/r/changemyview/comments/1ldyb9e/cmv_hasan_piker_isnt_a_good_representative_of_the/,2025,6
1lk296b,"CMV: Americans shouldn’t call themselves Irish, Italian, German, etc., if they are many generations removed and don’t actively live and contribute to that culture.","I’m from Quebec and there, people tend to identify based on the culture they actively live and participate in. Even if someone has Irish, French, British, or German ancestry and maybe still cooks certain traditional meals, celebrate holidays or knows some family stories they typically say “I’m Québécois,” not “I’m Irish” or “I’m French.” The identity is tied to the culture they were raised in and contribute to daily.
That’s why I find it confusing that many Americans call themselves Irish, Italian, German, etc., when their connection to those places is often distant like a great-great-great-grandparent and they’ve never been to the country, don’t speak the language, and don’t participate in the actual modern culture and society of that nation.
I feel like Americans often blur ethnicity with ancestry and heritage. Just because your family came from somewhere generations ago doesn’t necessarily mean you’re ethnically that today especially if you don’t speak the language, follow the customs, or meaningfully participate in the culture and/or current events. To me, there’s a big difference between having Irish ancestry and being Irish. But in the US, those two things often seem treated as the same.
From my outside perspective, it seems like this happens because a lot of Americans feel disconnected from a specific national culture of their own. The US is a very diverse and mixed country, and in many cases, “just being American” feels bland or culturally empty so claiming an ethnic label feels more meaningful, especially when talking to someone from abroad. It may come from a place of wanting to feel special, grounded, or connected to something old or “real.” I get that. But it also comes across as disconnected, surface level, cringey, cultural sampling and sometimes disrespectful to the people from that nation.
But when people like me from outside the US question this, some Americans react really defensively. It feels like they hear, “You’re bland” or “You have no culture,” when really we’re just trying to understand why ancestry is treated like identity even when it’s really far removed from current lived experience.
In Quebec, even when we still carry on family traditions, we don’t usually claim to “be” the ethnicity unless we were actually raised and lived in that cultural setting. To us, cultural identity is about your lived reality, not just fragments of heritage. It’s the language you speak, the region you live in, the worldview you share, and the culture you contribute to every day.
I’m not trying to mock or insult anyone. I understand people have pride in their family roots and traditions, and that’s valid. I just think there’s a difference between having ancestry and claiming identity, and I’d love to hear from Americans who see it differently. Because as someone who is also from a country that is a melting pot of cultures it’s very confusing.

Please keep it civil this isn’t meant to offend or dismiss anyone’s experiences. I’m genuinely open to having my view changed and understanding this better.

And I agree I love Russian literature, animation history etc etc… but there is another aspect that I don’t think people talk about, they have a group snug and demeaning attitude (on average ofc everyone is different). There is a culture of silence in Russia, people don’t say how they feel and there is pressure to fold to conformity as “Russia is just better and everything from the outside sucks”.  A lot generally think Russia is just arbitrarily better then other countries and so ignore evidence and statistics with their own eyes in the name of the country or whatever and it causes them to use whataboutism and fall in dogmatism, and thats one of the reasons they let themselves get fucked over by putin and his friends and ignore that to focus on Ukrainian nazis or whatever in Ukraine. Hell all the Russians I know in France are almost all fiercely anti western and genuinely believe Ukraine is full of nazis while Russia has more neo nazi groups then Ukraine ( in Russia nazi means anti Russian tho but they say that while they have been anti Ukraine since forever) and thats despite the fact they live and benefit from the west.

The simple fact is that in the two major conflict zones right now, Israel/Iran & Russia/Ukraine, at least  one side doesn't have a mutual defense pact with a strong enough country to trigger a cascade like what happened in WW1.

Iran doesn't have allies that care about it (Russia could have been seen as that, but they've publicly washed their hands of the situation), to the point that their own proxies like Hezbollah aren't getting involved.
Ukraine has the backing of the West, but no country has agreed to commit troops, and while Russia is getting support from North Korea, it's both ineffective and stops there.

1lmm5ee,"CMV: Redditors / Reddit present themselves as open minded, and supportive of diversity but in practice, it heavily censors or discourages conservative viewpoints","I always considered myself as liberal, open minded and progressive. I genuinely value hearing different perspectives and I always loved reading reddit because of that. Now I dont have any social media Reddit is only place I come to see different opinions. But over time, I have felt like Reddit has become extremely one sided, especially when it comes to political or socially charged topics. I notice that conservative or even moderately right leaning views often get treated with immediate hostility not just by users, but by moderators and even automated moderation systems.

It seems like if you post anything remotely sympathetic to views outside the dominant narrative for example, about Trump, abortion, immigration, or even certain local politicians your post either gets buried, mass downvoted, or removed by an automod before it even has a chance. I had a post about Zohran Mamdani as someone who loves NYC and it has taken down instantly, even though it didn’t say anything inflammatory and reason was irrelevant and i am writing about it because it is the most recent And i have seen others go through the same if not worse. 

Even subreddits that are supposed to encourage debate, like CMV, often feel like they only tolerate opposing views rather than truly welcoming them, actually not even tolerated. That doesn't feel like open mindedness to me and it feels like gatekeeping under the guise of civility or rule enforcement.

The part that hits me most is that Reddit seems to treat a huge portion of the country roughly half, depending on how you look at it as not just wrong, but evil. I am not even a Republican, but this has made me question whether I identify as a liberal or Democrat anymore. It’s a strange feeling, because I used to feel totally at home here. Now, I scroll Reddit and feel anxious, sad, or just disconnected. And I hate that because I still love Reddit and want to enjoy it the way I used to.

I am open to being proven wrong. Maybe I’m misreading things, or missing the bigger picture. Maybe moderation works differently than I assume. But right now, it doesn’t feel like Reddit lives up to its image as a place for real, diverse discussion.

Problem is, this is making me take harder stances on things that I dont even care that much. 

I know i ll get a lot of hate, and I know I also get heated and say things out of proportion but I am hoping to see couple of people with reason here so I still have a reason to come back here.

1l9v6g2,"CMV: There is no good reason, with the exception of special needs cases, to homeschool children in the US. Homeschooling is, again with that one exception, always a manifestation of the parent's desire for control, not of the child's best interest. Notes and Caveats in Body","The one notable exception is for a child with special needs, if you live in an area where the local public school system does not have adequate staff/training/facilities to educate your child. In that case, I would agree there is a good reason to homeschool. Otherwise, there are none. 

Common Objections-

1- But my school district sucks!: Unless you are a world class educator, which you probably aren't, even a fairly mediocre or overworked school system will still be able to provide your child a better education through the network of dozens of trained professionals your child will have access to over a given school year, than you can alone. Is the height of hubris to thing that you are equal to or better than a math teacher+ reading teacher+ history teacher+ social studies teacher+ science teacher+ gym coach+ guidance counselor, etc etc etc, even fairly mediocre ones. You are not.

2- But our schools are dangerous!: Then send them to a private school. Not all private schools are for rich people, there are middle class and even working class private schools. The tuition to these school will still cost less than the expense of your own training to properly educate, the materials, and your own time spent being a home educator rather than being out working. I get that maybe you WANT to be a stay at home educator, but again, if the best interest of your child and there education is genuinely your priority, even if your public schools are terrible, you will do better by them if you work a job and spend that wage on private school tuition. You are not a replacement for a school. If you are in a situation where you cannot afford even a low end private school, then you are not in a position to be able to afford to do a better job than your public school would anyway.

3- But my children will be exposed to (insert thing I don't like): Good! Social skills and learning how to navigate mixed company settings and social spaces with difference influences and cultures and ideas is just as important to be a properly adjusted and functioning adult as the book learning. In some contexts even more so.

  
What will change my mind: 

Some scenario, other than the single notable exception I listed above, where I am convinced that being homeschooled will actually result in a better education and better intellectual, emotional, and personal development than enrollment in a public school would, WHILE ALSO being a situation where a low end private school is also out of the question.

1ldftpo,CMV: Americans and people in the West who believe the Russian talking points about the war against Ukraine are some of the stupidest people in the world,"I understand the title comes across as harsh, but this is true as it gets. With Russians living in russia it makes sense why they believe the lies told, but for Americans and people in the west that have access to information free from the russian state, it just stupid.

Let me be crystal clear: I'm not saying that every single person who questions the war in Ukraine is stupid. Nor am I saying that questioning U.S. foreign policy will necessarily turn one into an ignorant individual. But when I hear people in the West—especially Americans—parrot talking points verbatim from the Kremlin propaganda machine, I can't help but question that we're working with some of the most gullible, uninformed, and plain stupidest individuals on this earth.

You don't have to be a geopolitical sage to see what's going on. A nuclear power dictatorship ruled by a man in office longer than the majority of Reddit users have been alive bombs a sovereign democratic neighbor. It takes land, kills civilians, and targets infrastructure—flagrant violations of international law. And still, there are Western apologists for it.

Some of the arguments I continually hear:

""NATO provoked Russia.""
Even if you believe that NATO expansion was a failure, nobody can explain an all-out invasion of a country that did not pose a threat to Russia. Ukraine was far from joining NATO when the invasion began.

""Ukraine is corrupt.""
True, but so is Russia—on a far larger and more systemic scale. Ukraine was (and continues to) work towards reforms and conduct democratic elections. Russia poisons journalists, jails opposition, and occupies neighbors. If corruption deserves an invasion, half the world is up for sale.

""The U.S. does bad things too.""
Yes, America does have a dirty history. That is no reason for Russia to be given a free pass to commit war crimes. This is the most idiotic whataboutism. Two wrongs do not make a right.

""It's all fake news, Ukraine is losing, it's just Western propaganda.""
This is astounding. Westerners with access to free media fall for easily debunked propaganda from state-run Russian sources. They gobble up blatantly staged ""news"" segments, fake maps, and appallingly terrible military analysis. If you believe that RT or some Telegram account with a hammer and sickle avatar avatar is providing you with the ""real story,"" I've got a bridge to sell you.


To believe these talking points is to disregard mountains of evidence, credible reporting, satellite imagery, war crimes reports, and the lived experiences of tens of millions of Ukrainians. And for what? To feel like you're ""not like the sheep,"" that you ""know the truth"" when in fact you've been conned by one of the most well-documented propaganda operations of the last century?

This kind of idiocy is not innocuous either. It undermines democratic solidarity with Ukraine, emboldens authoritarian governments, and mocks the very principle of truth in the public sphere. It's not ""just an opinion"" when it is grounded on falsehoods, and it is openly calling for a war of aggression.

So certain, I'll say it again: if you live in a free country that can access facts and still choose to believe Putin's disinformation, then you're voluntarily ignorant, intellectually lazy, or woefully gullible.

Today, as the conflict continues and many attempts at ceasefires have failed, I believe that Israel will continue the war until Gaza is completely destroyed and its people relocated or killed. 

It seems to me that all attempts at peace are fruitless and I haven’t seen any probable solutions proposed. Furthermore, it seems that the US will continue to provide weapons and support to Israel at least for the rest of Trump’s term.

But I just simply don't think it's prevelant in American society throughout the vast majority of the nation.

Do people who hate white people exist? Of course, but not the point to which we have a serious and persistent issue of anti white racism that is pervasive. 

The main argument I have here is the weakness of the other side's arguments. I feel like those who believe anti white racism is pervasive in America don't really have strong examples.

Many will claim either examples which the backing for is unclear or outright false examples. For instance, many will say DEI is anti white racism, but won't actually tell us how. Or, for instance, they'll use the example of the left's objection to the Afrikaner refugees from South Africa. But that would be more easily and directly explainable by pointing to the left not believing they had valid refugee cases and also Trump's spurning of refugees the left *does* believe have valid cases.

1l0xvyn,"CMV: For better or worse, Greg Abbot’s decision to bus illegal immigrants to “blue cities” was a political masterstroke and may very well have tipped the 2024 Presidential Election to Donald Trump.","For those who don’t know, Greg Abbott is the “beloved” governor of Texas and belongs to the Republican Party. For over a decade now but really in the last 5-6 years the migrant crisis at the border has been really bad for a variety of reasons both outside the United States control and within it but regardless of *why* it happened the unavoidable truth to most Texans was that there was a problem. 

And for years most on the Left dismissed the complaints as racist hyperbole by white folk that didn’t want to share their precious, racially homogenous cities and towns with brown people. When Trump rode to power in 2016, many on the Left proudly declared themselves opposed to his anti-immigration policies and supported the creation of “sanctuary cities”. 

Abbot’s response from to 21-24 was “okay, you want them so bad? Take ‘em” and began bussing hundreds upon hundreds of migrants to cities like Chicago and NYC. The rest is recent history. The migrants arrive and white liberals learn native black and brown Americans don’t like migrants anymore then their Texan fellow citizens, it becomes a toxic symbol of the immigration chaos of the Biden administration and on the Left more broadly.

This feeds into the growing consensus among Americans nationally that immigration is out of control and that we have a crisis at our southern border, which Donald Trump in turn helps use to take back the White House in 24. Greg Abbott turned himself into a darling of the Right by forcing liberals to put their money where the migrants mouth was, got rid of unwanted migrants and quite possibly changed the course of national history all for the low, low price of a bus ticket.

1lffpfd,"CMV: Israel’s attack on Iran was intended to draw the US into war, not prevent Iran from having a nuke","Israel claims its attack on Iran on Friday was about preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. I think that this is a pretty transparent lie for the reasons below.

Israel has been claiming Iran has been close to a nuclear weapon for 30 years. North Korea is significantly less advanced than Iran, but has successfully developed a nuke during that time period. 

Iran previously had a nuclear weapon program. That ended in 2003 to avoid getting attacked by the US. Since then, it looks like it’s strategy has been to use its nuclear capability for deterrence. (“stop fucking with us; we can build a nuke pretty quickly”)

It is clear that Iran does not want a conflict with the United States. Openly weaponizing their nuclear program invites that conflict. 

Of course, they could pursue weaponization in secret. But the US, UK and Israel knowingly misrepresented evidence of WMD prior to the Iraq war. It is more than fair for the public to demand proof of weaponization since one party in this conflict has previously used this exact same lie as cover for regime change.

Israel does not have the ability to inflict significant damage to Iran’s nuclear program or pursue regime change in Iran on its own. Even if they had the capability to destroy Fordow, the enriched uranium is almost certainly spread out across the country. If Iran’s entire nuclear program including the uranium were destroyed, it could still develop a bomb in under 5 years.

The only ways to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuke is convincing the regime that a nuke is not in their best interest or changing the regime. 

It’s still early, but it seems like Israel’s attack has made the idea of having a nuke more appealing to Iranians and the regime. It looks like having a nuke is the only way to deter Israel and its allies.

So why would Israel attack Iran? I think the most straightforward answer is they were hoping Iran would retaliate in a manner that forced the US to enter the conflict and pursue regime change.

Iran hasn’t taken the bait, so now Israel is attempting to present Iran as neutered by their campaign. “Iran is weak. Come over and help us finish the job”

Iran has been weakened, but they clearly have the capability to inflict more damage on Israel than they have demonstrated. The threat of offensive US involvement has constrained their response.

Once the US attacks, Iran will no longer be constrained by the threat of the US joining the conflict and will retaliate on US/ Israeli assets. The US will officially be in an offensive war that it did not initiate. This was Netanyahu’s actual calculation before Friday.

My view can be changed by concrete evidence of Iran’s nuclear weaponization and/or an explanation of how Israel thinks this bombing campaign will prevent Iran from pursuing a nuke without US involvement.

TL;DR: Israel doesn’t have the capability to meaningfully impact Iran’s nuclear program or pursue regime change on its own. They attacked Iran hoping that they could provoke a strong response that would draw the US into the conflict.

Meanwhile the Israelis continue to bomb major metropolitan areas in Iran. Yet these attacks are described as ""hitting targets"" with no mention of the civilian causulities involved. Yet when Isreali metropolitan areas are are hit we get detailed civilian casualty reports, and almost no mention of what the ""target"" was.

After the recent US attack, it is being reported that a diplomatic solution is still what US high command wants and that a ""larger protracted conflict is unlikely."" This is clearly a lie, and for it to be reported with out any context pushback or counterpoints is pure propaganda.

However currently parents are provided an option to opt their kids out of sex-ed, and prevent them from receiving it entirely. This option is somewhat unique to sex-ed, as parents aren't typically able to opt their kids out of specific parts of a school curriculum because of personal preference (I can't just choose to exclude my kid from learning about fractions).

1lke2i1,CMV: Diaspora Jews are unfairly treated and wrongly seen as a threat to the countries they live in,"I was born and raised in a Muslim-majority country as part of a small Jewish family. Over the years, I have witnessed how diaspora Jews are often subjected to unfair treatment, especially during times of international conflict. They are frequently viewed with suspicion, as if they secretly serve a foreign agenda or pose a threat to the countries they live in.

I believe this perception is deeply flawed, historically inaccurate, and socially harmful. Most diaspora Jews are peaceful, loyal citizens who simply want to live normal lives like everyone else. Yet, the moment a geopolitical crisis emerges, their loyalty is questioned, and they become targets of hate, conspiracy theories, and exclusion.

This is not just about political disagreements, it is about collective prejudice that gets triggered again and again regardless of context.

I’m open to hearing why some people might see this differently. If there are genuine reasons to be concerned about diaspora Jewish identity, I would like to understand them. But from my perspective, this generalized suspicion has no rational basis.

Many people who are pro-life actively support politicians and policies that harm low-income working-class families or even just have opinions contradicting their “pro-life” stance. 


Cutting funds/ shutting down programs such as Medicaid, WIC, SNAP, early childhood education, etc., actively harms families and children. 
There are tons of people who look down on single mothers or parents trying to get child support from the other parents. 

Some other examples of the fake pro-life stance include:
There has been a push to stop free school lunches as well as to defund public schools. 
The denial of science (vaccines, global climate change). 

I understand that the political movement of pro-life is about stopping abortions, and I agree. The goal isn’t about the care of the child after it’s born. That doesn’t mean you’re actually pro-life.

They do nothing to advocate for members of their own party, I see no justified rage, I see no action, no blame put onto republican politicians. These events are in the news for about a minute and then everyone forgets about it. 

Yet when Donald Trump gets shot in the ear by a right winger, the Republicans go off like rabid dogs in the media and blame rhetoric that came from the left and the Democrats BENT THE KNEE. The Democratic Party told their constituents to tone down their language for weeks despite valid criticism aimed at the Trump campaign. 

On top of that, Kamala Harris adopted Trump's immigration policy during the campaign and brought LIZ CHENEY on the road with her. She stopped talking about price gouging, they silenced progressive voices, they silenced Palestinian voices at the DNC, they did everything in their power to win over the imaginary moderate Republican voter. They betrayed their progessive base and expected them to fall in line due to lesser evil voting. Now seeing how much smoke Democrats have for Mamdani, I fear they have yet to learn their lesson.

Instead of countering right wing naratives, institutional Democrats have been adopting right wing talking points. Why would any Republican voter vote Democrat when for years, they've been on opposite sides of the spectrum? You come off as disingenuous when your go from ""No kids in cages"" to ""We can put kids in cages more humanely."" When you adopt right wing policies, when you campaign on having the strongest military in the world while supporting an active genocide, when you advocate for harsher immigration policies instead of talking about pathways to citizenship, DO NOT expect progressive voters to write you in out of obligation.

1lg8xi2,CMV: I have yet to hear a compelling argument against the implementation of a UBI,"I'm a pretty liberal gal. I don't believe in the idea that people would ""earn a living"", they're already alive and society should guarantee their well being because we're not savages that cannot know better than every man to himself. Also I don't see having a job or being employed as an inherent duty of a citizen, many jobs are truly miserable and if society is so efficient that it can provide to non-contributors, then they shouldn't feel compelled to find a job just because society tells them they have to work their whole life to earn the living that was imposed upon them.

Enter, UBI. I've seen a lot of arguments for it, but most of them stand opposite to my ideology and do nothing to counter it so they're largely ineffective. 

""If everybody had money given to them they'd become lazy!"" perfect, let them

""Everyone should do their fair share"" why? Why must someone suffer through labor under the pretense of covering a necessity that's not real, as opposed to strictly vocational motivations?

""It's untested""/""It won't work"" and we'll never know unless we actually try

""The politics won't allow it"" I don't care about inhuman politics, that's not an argument against UBI, that's an argument against a system that simply chooses not to improve the lives of the people because of an abstract concept like ""political will"".

1l1ry13,CMV: Sydney Sweeney is just as wrong as the men buying her product.,"IMO:

Nothing is empowering about what she’s doing. In no way, shape, or form is selling bath water helping women. She's pandering to men and normalizing grotesque behaviors. 

The bath water campaign has a very similar, if not worse, damaging effect than porn. It reinforces in men’s minds that women are objects to be paid for, and discredits the actual work of the already suffering feminist movement by defending her behavior. 

The men are just as gross for buying it. There’s no justifying paying to use the bathwater of someone else. We all know how it’s going to be used, and so does Sydney. This entire campaign reinforces the already growing preconceived notion women have that men are lustful, dangerous, creeps. 

I’ve seen so many men blaming Sydney for “selling herself”, and a lot of women saying she’s allowed to profit off of creeps, you’re both wrong. This is promoting and encouraging extremely harmful behaviors.

1loeyan,CMV: The modern left’s outrage at the far-right disappears when the far-right is Islamic.,"My thesis is simple: The modern left condemns the far right in Europe and the United States relentlessly—whether it’s MAGA, the AfD, Viktor Orbán, or rising anti-immigrant movements. Yet that same energy is rarely, if ever, directed toward ideologies that are equally or more harmful, such as political Islam, hyper-conservative religious doctrines held by so-called “oppressed” groups, or radicals whose violence is cloaked in anti-Western grievances. I don’t know if this is because of Edward Said-like ideology being very common, but it’s just incredibly hypocritical and leads to a power vacuum in western countries’ discourse, allowing advantageous, right-wing ideologies like political Islam to take advantage of our moral agnosticism. 

This moral subjectivity, grounded in a reflexive loyalty to the perceived underdog, reveals that many leftists don’t actually stand for consistent principles at all. They stand for oppositional posturing—opposing whoever holds power, regardless of what replaces it.

The Israel–Palestine conflict illustrates this perfectly. In the early days of Israel’s existence, many Western leftists embraced it as a post-colonial, kibbutznik-style socialist experiment. Figures like Che Guevara visited. The USSR was among the first to recognize it. But once the balance of power shifted—once Israel was no longer the underdog—leftist support evaporated. The legitimate aims of Jewish self-determination became suspect, and every act of Israeli defense was rebranded as aggression. Meanwhile, Islamist movements with openly theocratic, supremacist, and regressive agendas were increasingly portrayed as “resistance. Whether it’s Hamas leadership saying civilian deaths/martyrdom are a necessary cost of war, or the land will be cleansed of the Jews (not the Zionists, mind you), it is completely ignored or undermined as being the “language of the oppressed”, or as justified hatred and “the resistance isn’t perfect”. 

Another key factor leftists ignore is the binding political structure of Islam. Unlike Christianity or Judaism, which has undergone centuries of theological reform and secularization or jurisprudence balancing today’s norms with that of 2000 years ago, Islam is considered the final, unalterable word of God. The Qur’an is viewed as perfect, eternal, and universally applicable, and the Sunnah—the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad are meant to be prescriptive. In many Muslim communities, especially in places like Bangladesh or Pakistan men literally model the length and color of their beards on Muhammad’s—keeping it a fist-length and dyeing it orange with henna, just as he reportedly did. If external grooming is emulated with such precision, what other commands—regarding governance, gender roles, punishment, or war—wouldn’t also be followed? This isn’t a fringe interpretation; it’s a mainstream, deeply rooted worldview, and pretending it’s merely a cultural variant or spiritual tradition—as many leftists do—is intellectual dishonesty at best, and dangerous appeasement at worst.",Significant_Tip_9123,526,1045,0.6399999856948853,0.1644270268451707,1751307480,/r/changemyview/comments/1loeyan/cmv_the_modern_lefts_outrage_at_the_farright/,2025,6

1lg9x41,cmv: Iran's possession of highly enriched Uranium is highly indicative of them seeking to develop a nuclear weapon.,"So, I believe that , people are either being willfully ignorant, or not understanding the relationship between highly enriched uranium and nuclear weapons. There is this concept that the two are totally separate things, which is false.

First, lets look at the [IAEA report on Iran](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/25/06/gov2025-24.pdf)

>3. Iran has estimated27 that at FFEP from 8 February to 16 May 2025:    
166.6 kg of UF6 enriched up to 60% U-235 were produced;  
 560.3 kg of UF6 enriched up to 20% U-235 were fed into the cascades;   
 68.0 kg of UF6 enriched up to 20% U-235 were produced  
  441.8 kg of UF6 enriched up to 5% U-235 were fed into cascades;   
 229.1 kg of UF6 enriched up to 5% U-235 were produced;   
396.9 kg of UF6 enriched up to 5% U-235 were accumulated as tails;   
 368.7 kg of UF6 enriched up to 2% U-235 were accumulated as tails;   
 98.5 kg of UF6 enriched up to 2% U-235 were accumulated as dump.

This means in 3 months , Iran produced 1/5 of a ton of highly enriched uranium . 

This is in addition to the 83.7% uranium detected at the Fordo facility which inspectors do not have access to [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/iran-announces-start-of-construction-on-new-nuclear-power-plant](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/iran-announces-start-of-construction-on-new-nuclear-power-plant)

Nuclear reactors for energy ONLY need 3-5% enriched Uranium

To put this into context of a relatable situation, say you have a neighbor, and one day, you notice that neighbor getting Ammonium Nitrate, say about 50 pounds of it, at their door step. Ammonium Nitrate is an explosive, which has been used for several large bombings, but is also a fertilizer. You ask the neighbor, why do they have this chemical compound? They say its for gardening. But their garden is small, 50 pounds of fertilizer is for large farms. 

The next week, you see another shipment of ammonium nitrate. This time, its even bigger. You ask the neighbor whats going on. They say, its for gardening and planting. 

Now, ammonium nitrate itself, isn't a bomb. You obviously need to build some sort of bomb to ignite it. But the separation between having large amounts of ammonium nitrate as a civilian vs making a bomb does not have a reasonable difference. Anyone with large quantities of ammonium nitrate should be suspected of wanting to do some terrible things.",Healthy_Shine_8587,431,965,0.6200000047683716,0.14777424521835722,1750440703,/r/changemyview/comments/1lg9x41/cmv_irans_possession_of_highly_enriched_uranium/,2025,6

1li0ee2,"CMV: Trump's refusal to actively prosecute large employers of illegal immigrants reveals he is not running his deportation campaign for security, economic, or moral reasons.","Okay. Here's the deal.

There is a clear and obvious reason why most illegal immigrants come to the United States. It's not because they just love stealing all of our welfare and eating people's cats. 

It is because big corporations hire them. 

The reasons they do this is obvious. It lets them get cheap labor. 

But Trump is not going after them (sample citation: [https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-18/immigration-raids-employer-employee](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-18/immigration-raids-employer-employee) ). Why?

Now, letting a bunch of people into the country without any vetting is bad. We can all agree on that. And every undocumented person who comes in and is sheltered by these big businesses is a potential security risk. But Trump has made no moves to patch this hole or massively penalize companies for making Americans less safe. Thus, either Trump's current deportation plan is not about national security, or he is being extremely stupid and ignoring a massive hole in our national defense.

Let's move on to money, where the inverse is the case.   
  
Far from being a resource sink, Illegal immigrants are actually major economic contributors (sample citations: [https://americansfortaxfairness.org/undocumented-immigrants-contribute-economy/](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/undocumented-immigrants-contribute-economy/) ; [https://cmsny.org/importance-of-immigrant-labor-to-us-economy/](https://cmsny.org/importance-of-immigrant-labor-to-us-economy/) ). They also work jobs that American workers quite frankly are not able to fill: (sample citation: [https://www.rawstory.com/trump-farmers-2672410822/?u=eb87ad0788367d505025d9719c6c29c64dd17bf89693a138a44670acfdc86a46&utm\_source=Iterable&utm\_medium=email&utm\_campaign=Jun.21.2025\_8.59pm](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-farmers-2672410822/?u=eb87ad0788367d505025d9719c6c29c64dd17bf89693a138a44670acfdc86a46&utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Jun.21.2025_8.59pm) ).

Now, if Trump wanted to keep all that money flowing into our economy, he could just ignore the issue or start a generous work visa program that vetted the people willing to come into the country and work for cheap while still letting them come in. He wouldn't be hunting them down with constant, expensive immigration raids. So this can't be about money. 

Finally we move to move on to morals. A lot of people think it's just immoral to cross the border illegally and thus break the law. Even if I don't agree I can accept that. 

But Trump is actively deporting people who are refugees due to US actions (sample citation: [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/afghanistan-trump-deportation-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/afghanistan-trump-deportation-threat) ). And human trafficking victims with essential jobs (sample citation [https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-teachers-aide-self-deports-with-us-born-twin-daughters/65089409](https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-teachers-aide-self-deports-with-us-born-twin-daughters/65089409) ). Those people never broke the law at all, and (generally speaking) committed no crimes. Thus there is no moral reason to deport them.

But do you know who is being immoral and breaking the law? Large companies that are aiding and abetting illegal immigrants instead of reporting them to the authorities. If this was about the immorality of breaking the law, then big companies would be causing way more moral harm than individual migrants. And they would be the primary targets. 

So with moral, economic and security reasons for the deportations out the window, the only reasons I can think of to conduct these massive raids is racism, security theater, and/or  as a cover for something else.

1l0x318,CMV: The term “Zio” has no place in left pro-Palestine activism and amounts to support for antisemitic white supremacy.,"The term “zio” is a well-documented product of white supremacist organizations  and leaders such as David Duke who notably popularized and mainstreamed the term. It is commonly used by neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers, and their allies. 

It is unfortunately now becoming popular among pro-Palestine activists who would likely identify themselves as left-aligned. 

I contend that this is damaging and undermining to left movements in general, and to the pro-Palestine movement specifically. 

I also contend that if someone uses the term despite knowing its origin and intent, they are intentionally platforming white supremacy and spreading white supremacist tropes. This can only benefit white supremacists and it certainly cannot be anti-racist or pro-Jewish in effect.

It is absolutely acceptable and IMO necessary to harshly criticize Zionism and self-described Zionists. Things like the IHRA definition of antisemitism are wrong and attempts to conflate antisemitism with anti-Zionism are a dishonest ploy to undermine the Palestine Liberation movement. And they are dangerous for Jews in general as they conflate Israel’s genocide and other crimes with Jewish identity in general. 

The term “Zio” was invented to do exactly the same thing. It makes the line between “Jew” and “Zionist” intentionally blurry to give cover to white supremacists who want to be able to openly denigrate Jews and avoid accountability. 

If there was a unique value to this term — if it expressed something that could not be communicated otherwise then perhaps you could argue that we should ignore its original purpose and accept that language evolves. 

However the entire premise of the term when used by supposed leftists is that it is “just” an abbreviation of “Zionist.” When used by white supremacists it is intended to mean “Jew.” 

So the *only* cost to a pro-Palestine activist in rejecting the term is typing four additional letters. If one means “Zionist,” then just say, “Zionist.” 

There cannot be any good reason for left pro-Palestine groups or communities to allow this term in their midst. Not only does it actively platform and spread white supremacist tropes, but it also creates space for hasbara plants and cointelpro agitators to discredit Palestine liberation activism and creates a barrier for anti-Zionist Jews and POCs who may understandably not feel safe around activists throwing around neo-Nazi terms. 

If, for example, you have a subreddit that has policies around hate speech, racist terminology, etc. you should absolutely have a policy against this term.

1ll1kuv,CMV: ICE workers and detention facility staff will become the next generation's shameful historical example of ordinary people enabling atrocities.,"I've been hearing reports of the conditions at Migrant facilities in the USA. They already have been terrible, but with the increased quota and lack of new infrastructure its going to get a whole lot worse.

Can it get worse than causing a Pregnant woman's 5 month old fetus to die and sit inside her for days? Absolutely. It is just a matter of time - time that the Trump administration has.

They have a minimum of 1.5 more years if Ds manage to take back the house and senate and frighteningly 3.5 more if they don't. This is more than enough time for atrocities to become normalized and have numbers rack up.

Maybe they will run out of money, but that hasn't stopped the USA from spending.

I believe that if this continues, the truth will eventually come out and there will be a lot of evidence that will eventually get shared. 

When stories come out, politicians will ask for people to be prosecuted. To my knowledge ICE does not have a special judicial system like the military, which can hide crimes because of special treatment. If Ds win the presidency, then the DOJ will prosecute everyone they can and I bet enough Rs will jump in to distance themselves from Trump that it could get bipartisan support.

In this scenario, most ICE agents will be identified and at the very least shunned by society and probably the world. Migrants will tell stories of specific people who abused them. I'm sure texts and conversations will be leaked. Paper trails of who abducted whom will be available. It will be hard to hide.

This all depends on whether or not Trump / Maga lose power and I have a feeling they will when the Trump admin's policies continue to hurt the working class. You can disagree, but with Iran, up-coming medicaid cuts, increased deficit spending for rich people, and higher prices it seems more and more likely.

1lgwxlh,"CMV: There will never be full peace between Israel and all of its neighbors and there is no ""solution"" to these conflicts","Would love for someone to change my view about this, because I feel somewhat hopeless. Basically as I see it:

\- From the Arab and Muslim point of view, there is too much religious and historic significance to the land, Jerusalem, and Al Aqsa. The temptation for a leader to try to become the next Saladin, the liberator of Jerusalem, unifier of the middle east and defeater of the western ""crusaders"" will always be too great. Even if some neighbors (like Jordan and Egypt) make peace, others (like Iran) will always see the demagogic opportunity to make Israel the enemy and to promise to recapture Jerusalem -- whether they mean it or are just using it to rally their people. Additionally, the defeat that the founding of Israel represents will always be a stain on regional and religious pride and a psychic wound that needs to be avenged.

\- From the Israeli/Jewish point of view, Israel and Jerusalem will also always have its significance as the center of the Jewish religion, the subject of many of its key prayers and literature, the location of all of its holy sites. And also, the modern state of Israel will always have strong emotional significance as a place of liberation for Jews, a haven, a place of strength, and the answer to Jews' own psychic wound of having been persecuted for hundreds of years in Europe and the Middle East. Not to mention the pride of having built the state that will make it hard to let go of.

Moreover, a majority of Israeli Jews will always see it as necessary to Israel's survival to maintain a Jewish majority in the state, and therefore will never be open to a single state in all of Israel/Gaza/WB, while Palestinians will never accept a state in just some of the land.

I don't see a solution to the tension between these contradictory forces/goals. I don't see a scenario where the entire Arab and Muslim world simultaneously chills out about Israel being there, and I don't see a scenario where Israel chills out about being threatened. If Iran falls, Turkey will take over the same role. If Israel looks weak, someone will pounce. If Israel is strong, it will try to destroy those who threaten it, which will only make some people more determined to destroy it. It just seems like a never-ending cycle, unless something shifts in the balance of power.

Tell me I'm wrong.

1ll42ps,"CMV: I’m fed up with uk tax system, I don’t think it’s fair.","Unpopular opinion, maybe, but I need to say this somewhere.

I earn over £100k, so I know I’m seen as “comfortable” — and I’m not here to claim I’m struggling to survive. But I do feel completely penalised and invisible in the current UK system, especially with all the talk about council tax reform and making high earners pay more.

I’m the sole earner in my household. My partner earns very little, and I cover everything: housing, food, childcare, bills. We live in a modest but decent house (which, apparently, now makes us “wealthy” again when it comes to council tax reform).

I don’t get any help. No child benefit. No 30 hours childcare. No universal credit. And if I earn between £100–125k, I get caught in a 60% marginal tax trap because of the loss of personal allowance. That’s before student loans or pension deductions.

I’m not asking for pity — I know others have it worse. But what frustrates me is the lack of nuance in how we talk about fairness. It’s assumed that people in my bracket are coasting. We’re not.

We’re heavily taxed, not eligible for support, and now expected to pick up even more of the tab with things like council tax reform — while many genuinely wealthy people who live off investments or own multiple properties get away with paying proportionally much less.

I feel like I’m being punished for being the “easy” kind of person to tax. My income is visible, trackable, and not sheltered offshore.

I’m not against supporting those in need — quite the opposite. I want a strong safety net and a fairer system. But what I don’t understand is why there’s no space in the conversation for people like me, who are working hard, carrying a household, and feeling like there’s no upside to earning more.

Curious if anyone else here feels this “silent squeeze” too. Maybe you can make me see this differently.

1l6kziw,CMV: Democrats have learned nothing,"After the [NYT editorial by Ezra Klein](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/opinion/abundance-democrats-future.html) where he strangely seems confused why neoliberals are in love with his new book, I'm convinced that Democrats will push for the same centrist platform that has brought us two Trump presidencies.

His co-author, Derek Thompson, is staunchly anti-union ([in his own words from 2012](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/unnecessary-and-political-why-unions-are-bad-for-america/258405/); and sections in the book *Abundance* that puts the blame on unions--not oligarchs).

But this is the direction the Dems seem to want to go (aside from young, smart ones). 

I've voted 30+ years as a Dem. I won't vote for them in 2028 if it's more of the corporate friendly BS that got us here.

It's early still. My view is based on what I've seen pushed in legacy media. I just don't see the Democrats being capable to rise to this moment. Between Schumer stepping on his dick non-stop for six months, and Jeffries being wholly incapable of articulating a response that matters (and makes sense, WTF picked this guy? Oh, right, Pelosi)--and then seeing like half of the NYC mayoral candidates name Jeffries as one of the most amazing liberals in office right now, I have zero hope.",RealSimonLee,434,800,0.699999988079071,0.12820339559077282,1749411840,/r/changemyview/comments/1l6kziw/cmv_democrats_have_learned_nothing/,2025,6
