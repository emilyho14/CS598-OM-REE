1fi41o4,CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy.,"If you're voting for Trump in the 2024 election, it suggests that you either have a lack of understanding about what has happened over the last decade and have been subject to misinformation, or are actively against democracy. 

There is a minority of Trump-voters who would like to see another system in place than the current system of democratic values, because they think their values and ideals are more important than democracy. Those who would rather live in a tyranny or other aristocratic system, as long as their needs and values are met. 

The vast part of the republican voters does not want to get rid of democracy - nor is it in their best interest - and are just un- or misinformed about current events. Even if your opinions are generally in line with most of the things Trump stands for, and you're actively opposed to everything Harris stands for, it should not matter since one side does not adhere to democratic values and the other does. I understand that a lot of information that people in the US get is heavily colored in favour of one candidate or the other

All of this has been made especially clear since January 6th; if you support a candidate that attempted to commit a coup d'était, you want to subvert democracy, or you don't have the correct information to make an informed choice.

I'm open to discussion and reconsidering my views if presented with new insights, as ""they're all misinformed or authoritarian"" feels overly simplistic. My perspective comes from observing recent events, but I'm curious to see whether my view is shaped by the news I receive or if there’s a more nuanced explanation.

1fboo3p,CMV: Hijabs are sexist,"I've seen people (especially progressive people/Muslim women themselves) try to defend hijabs and make excuses for why they aren't sexist.

But I think hijabs are inherently sexist/not feminist, especially the expectation in Islam that women have to wear one. The basic idea behind wearing a hijab (why it's a thing in the first place) is to cover your hair to prevent men from not being able to control themselves, which is problematic. It seems almost like victim-blaming, like women are responsible for men's impulses/temptations. Why don't Muslim men have to cover their hair?

I've heard feminist Muslim women try to make defenses for it. (Like, ""It brings you closer to God,"" etc.) But they all sound like excuses, honestly. This is basically proven by the simple fact that women don't have to wear one around other women or their male family members, but they have to wear it around other men that aren't their husbands. There is no other reason for that, besides sexism/heteronormativity, that actually makes sense. Not to mention, what if the woman is lesbian, or the man is gay? You could also argue that it's homophobic, in addition to being sexist.

I especially think it's weird that women don't have to wear hijabs around their male family members (people they can't potentially marry), but they have to wear one around their male cousins.

1ff2phz,CMV: Pedophiles Are Treated Unfairly,"Alright, calm down. I can already hear the pitchforks. I'll clarify two things before I begin: 

1: My post refers to **non-offending** pedophiles. Those who have an attraction toward children who have **not** committed a crime. Anybody who has committed an offence against a child should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. 

2: I am not a pedophile. Many people assume that anybody who speaks up on such a topic must automatically be involved, but the reason for my opinion is two fold. I was sexually abused as a child and I now work with young people who were released from a variety of institutions (detention centres, mainly), many of whom either suffered sexual abuse, or engaged in it. I am not a doctor, nor am I a psychologist. 

  
So, my view is relatively straightforward. I believe that society has demonised pedophiles to a point that makes life less safe for children. 

I believe that every non-offending pedophile should be treated with the same respect, care and compassion that we give to any other member of society who is suffering with a mental illness. Treatment in the form of counselling/therapy or anything else that is possible, should be widely available and completely confidential. 

I believe that the rhetoric of 'kill all pedophiles' does nothing but prevent these people from coming forward to receive the help that they need to stop them from acting on their thoughts. 

Finally, I believe that if we, as a society, showed more compassion to these people, and encouraged getting professional help like we do with many major mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc) that the world would be a much safer place for the most vulnerable members of our communities. 

  
To confirm; I am speaking **only** about *non-offending* pedophiles. ",NameOk2758,1397,2236,0.6299999952316284,0.4319094794856332,1726148072,/r/changemyview/comments/1ff2phz/cmv_pedophiles_are_treated_unfairly/,2024,9
1fihxa0,CMV: there is such a thing as “being racist towards white people”.,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not white. I appear white, but most of my ancestry is Middle Eastern and Asian. I was born and raised in a Muslim-majority country. When I moved to the West, I was surprised to see how the white people here (particularly those leaning left) behave as if everything bad happening in the world is their direct fault. There is so much focus on being politically correct and tolerant, yet it seems to be the status quo to constantly shit on white people. 

I’ve had conversations with people who have this dislike for the white population, and they tell me that this hate stems from the West’s involvement in colonisation and now the white Westerners are to pay the price for the actions of their ancestors. This makes no sense. Many non Western countries out there have done horrible things, have invaded and colonised other states, waged cruel wars and the list goes on. Another argument I’m presented with is how there is still exploitation of particularly African countries by the Western nations. But how does attacking uninvolved white people help those impacted by this exploitation? Also, non Western countries also exploit other states.

There is absolutely such a thing as racism towards white people. Since I’m not white, people holding these views feel very comfortable talking bad about random white people and unironically call them colonisers in my presence. And the white folks will just take it all and apologise on top of it. Why? You never personally colonised anyone, if your great great someone did, that’s not your fault and not something you ought to make apologies for.

I don’t understand why you put up with this, especially in your own countries. It wouldn’t fly where I was born, but here it seems a societal norm even.

1fkl7y7,CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause,"I’ll start by saying I’m Jewish, and vaguely a Zionist in the loosest sense of the term (the state of Israel exists and should continue to exist), but deeply critical of Israel and the IDF in a way that has cause me great pain with my friends and family. 

To the CMV: Hezbollah is a recognized terrorist organization. It has fought wars with Israel in the past, and it voluntarily renewed hostilities with Israel after the beginning of this iteration of the Gaza war because it saw an opportunity Israel as vulnerable and distracted. 

Israel (I’ll say ‘allegedly’ for legal reasons, as Israel hasn’t yet admitted to it as of this writing, but, c’mon) devised, and executed, a plan that was targeted, small-scale, effective, and with minimal collateral damage. It intercepted a shipment of pagers that Hezbollah used for communications and placed a small amount of explosives in it - about the same amount as a small firework, from the footage I’ve seen. 

These pagers would be distributed by Hezbollah to its operatives for the purpose of communicating and planning further terrorist attacks. Anyone who had one of these pagers in their possession received it from a member of Hezbollah. 

The effect of this attack was clear: disable Hezbollah’s communications system, assert Israel’s intelligence dominance over its enemies, and minimize deaths. 

The attack confirms, in my view, that Israel has the capability to target members of Hamas without demolishing city blocks in Gaza. It further condemns the IDFs actions in Gaza as disproportionate and vindictive. 

I know many people who have been active on social media across the spectrum of this conflict. I know many people who post about how they are deeply concerned for Palestinians and aggrieved by the IDFs actions. Several of them have told me that they think the pager attack was smart, targeted and fair. 

I still know several people who are still posting condemnations of the pager attack. Many of them never posted anything about Palestine before October 7, 2023. I belief that most of them are interacting with this issue because it is trendy. 

What will CMV: proof that the pager attack targeted civilians, suggestions of alternative, more targeted and proportionate methods for Israel to attack its enemies. 

What will not CMV: anecdotal, unconfirmed tales of mass death as a result of the pager attacks, arguments that focus on Israel’s existence, arguments about Israel’s actions in Gaza, or discussions of Israel’s criminal government.

1f8d5lm,"CMV: Broadway would never allow a “Book of Mormon” style, satirical play on the Quran and neither would most Muslims","Say what you will about the LDS church but they at least have a good sense of humor about themselves. While the play is actually a love letter — in many ways — organized Christianity from atheists, it still does have many biting criticisms of the Mormon church and it takes having a somewhat of a thick skin to take them all with a smile. 

I don’t think this would be the same with Muhammad and Quran. In part because the God of the Quran is a lot more oblique and mysterious, the connection people feel with him is displaced to Muhammad instead. Hence the treatment of him as if he is god, not just a mortal man who’s his messenger. 

All this to say, there would be tons of public protests all over the world, bomb threats and gun threats in the lead up to opening day of the show. But, I think in all honesty it would be more outside America than within it. American Muslims, though they might be more upset with the blasphemous message and disrespectful tone, are pretty liberal overall and not much different from American Christians. Worldwide im sure there would be lots of “death to America and the gays on broadway” chants too. 

Nevertheless it would be an extremely volatile, toxic issue the pick-me Mercedes mujahideen type liberals who would lose their mind because they’d have to choose between treating Islam like Christianity conservatives or being “one of the good ones.” But if you’re in America, I can’t speak for anywhere else, part of the buy-in is being okay with people making fun of your religion.

You gotta be okay with jokes about Moses losing his map.

1f905a1,CMV: Voter ID is a totally sensible policy.,"Some context as to my view: 
- I’m an American dual citizen. I have been old enough to vote in one presidential election in both countries. For the election outside of the US, I needed to have a valid ID that was issued by the government to all citizens over the age of 18 in order to vote. Having experienced this, calls for voter ID in the US seem totally reasonable to me, with one important caveat. There needs to be a way for American citizens to easily get an ID. Getting a traditional form of ID like a driver’s license or passport is not universally accesible, you need to know how to drive to get a license or pay in order to apply for a passport. If you fix this by getting the government to issue voter ID cards to people who apply for free, then I really see no drawbacks to Voter ID policies.

1f7a62j,cmv: Demisexual is not a real sexuality,"This goes for demisexual, graysexual, monosexual(the term is pointless jesus), sapoisexual, and all the other sexualities that are just fancy ways of saying i have a type or a lack of one. 

but i’m gonna focus on demisexual bc it makes me the most confused. 

So demisexual is supposedly when a person feels sexually attracted to someone only after they've developed a close emotional bond with them. Simple enough, right? Wrong, because sexuality is a person's identity in relation to the gender or genders to which they are typically attracted; sexual orientation. Which means demisexual is not a sexuality by definition. 

Someone who is gay, straight, lesbian, or bi could all be demi because demisexual isn’t a sexuality it’s just when people get comfortable enough to have sex with their partner, which is 100% fine but not a damn sexuality. not everyone can have sex with someone when they first meet them and that’s normal, but i’ve got this weird inclination that people who use the term demisexual to describe themselves can’t find the difference between not being completely comfortable with having sex with someone until they get to know them or feeling a complete lack of sexual attraction until they get to know someone. 

maybe i’m missing something but i really can’t fully respect someone if they use this term like it’s legit. to me, it’s just a label to make people feel different and included in the lgbt community.

1fes0nh,CMV: Israel Should Be Sanctioned for Killing an American Citizen Today,"My view is that this issue has reached a boiling point. This is not the first US citizen that Israel has killed American citizens. Credible claims point to no less than five American citizens whom Israel has claimed responsibility for killing (one way or another) in the recent past.

The most recent incident is particularly alarming in my view and does warrant actual sanctions as a response. Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was killed by a bullet Israel alleges was aimed at the **leader of a protest.** Amazingly to me, the White House has *hatched* a completely far fetched idea suggesting a sniper bullet ""ricochet"" caused an American civilian to be shot in the head and killed.

The glaring issue for me is that (just like in the case of Saudi Arabia) I do not understand why we are choosing to keep the taps flowing on money to ""allies"" who are carrying out **extra-judicial** killings of journalists or protesters, especially American citizens. My view is that a strongly worded letter, as promised by the White House, is simply not enough. I'm fairly sure that no NATO country could get away with this, and I believe this demands a serious response that carries some sort of consequence.",FinTecGeek,970,1389,0.6399999856948853,0.2799532722363514,1726108151,/r/changemyview/comments/1fes0nh/cmv_israel_should_be_sanctioned_for_killing_an/,2024,9
1f8mci4,CMV: Abortion is an absolute right.,"What is the point of the right to life if you don’t have bodily autonomy? 

First off, what bodily autonomy is and what it isn’t. Bodily autonomy isn’t the right to do anything you want with your own body. No, you can’t use the right of bodily autonomy to defend drinking and driving, self mutilation, or harming other people. It doesn’t give an airline pilot the right to “use his body” to crash a plane full of people. That’s ridiculous. What bodily autonomy is, is the right to determine who can use your body and for what purpose. While people tend to focus on its use when it comes to abortion rights, it’s also what gives us the right to refuse blood, tissue, and organ donation, the right that makes rape a crime, even the right of terminally ill patients to request and obtain a DNR order. It is directly related to the right to remain secure in one’s person as per the fourth amendment. Without the right to bodily autonomy, and the right to deny someone else access to one’s physical body, what is there to prevent having blood drawn or urine obtained against one’s will for testing?

Where this falls into the abortion argument is that the right of bodily autonomy allows a pregnant person to refuse the use of their body to a fetus. While there are those who say bodily autonomy doesn’t give a person the right to “murder”, what it does give a person the right to do is remove another person who is physically attached to their body, and using their blood, tissues, and organs against their will, even if that other person will die due to that removal. It doesn’t matter how that person got there, if the potential donor originally consented, or what the relationship is between the potential donor and the patient. The potential donor always has the right to refuse another person the use of their body and/or remove another person from their physical body regardless of consequences.

Now, while people look at this with the abortion argument as if you deny this right of bodily autonomy to pregnant people, they are not allowed to remove the fetus from their physical bodies, and this removing this right would “save babies”, removing any right from any person is a dangerous path to tread, and I have several examples of why.

Scenario 1: Abortion.

Patient A is pregnant. She wants to have an abortion to deny the use of her body to the healthy fetus she is carrying. The right of bodily autonomy allows her to do this. Without the right of bodily autonomy, she is forced to carry the fetus to term and give birth. While in most cases of a healthy fetus and a healthy mother, while there would be discomfort and pain during the pregnancy and birth, both would come out alive. However, all pregnancy has the potential to cause permanent injury to the pregnant person or result in the death of pregnant person, fetus, or both, even uncomplicated pregnancies. By removing the right of bodily autonomy from Patient A, we are forcing her to risk her health and her life against her will to support another person with the use of her physical body.

Scenario 2: Pregnancy and medical care.

Patient B is pregnant. She is planning to carry the pregnancy to term and deliver the child. While she is pregnant, she develops a medical condition such as cancer, the treatment for which can and would cause harm to her fetus. Because the fetus is prior to the point of viability, live birth isn’t an option for her child. The choice must be made to either abort the fetus and begin treatment of the mother, or maintain the pregnancy until the fetus is viable outside of the womb, and allow the cancer to progress and the mother’s survival odds to drop. Without the right of bodily autonomy, Patient B is not allowed to make this decision for herself. This is not a hypothetical situation. This was the reality in Ireland prior to the retraction of laws banning abortion. When the life of a fetus outweighs the right of the person carrying it to bodily autonomy means that a pregnant person cannot receive medical treatment that would require the abortion of that fetus so long as it has a heartbeat, nor can the pregnant person obtain medical treatment that could cause harm to the fetus. Removing the right to bodily autonomy removes the right of a pregnant person to choose their own medical care for their own medical conditions. Medications, treatments, and even certain testing would become unavailable based entirely on the contents of one’s womb. Broken limb? X Rays can harm a fetus. Cancer? Chemo and radiation can harm a fetus. Mentally ill? Most psychiatric drugs and treatments can cause harm to a fetus.

Scenario 3: Drugs, alcohol, and pregnancy.

Patient C is sexually active, but is using reliable birth control. As a result, being sure that she cannot become pregnant, she continues to drink, smoke cigarettes, and use recreational drugs. Because her chosen birth control interrupts her period (as some forms such as the IUD, the shot, or continuous use of the pill without use of the placebo week can do) she doesn’t have her period and thus it ending isn’t a tip off. It’s flu season and all her friends are sick, so her nausea is easy to explain. When she begins gaining weight in her midsection, she goes to the doctor where she finds out she is several months pregnant. Because she has been drinking, smoking, and using recreational drugs that are known to harm a fetus throughout her pregnancy, she not only must carry the fetus to term regardless of the medical condition of the child, but she can also be charged with harming the fetus she wasn’t aware she was carrying because again, without bodily autonomy, the rights of the fetus outweigh the rights of the person carrying it. Far fetched you say? It is the reality for pregnant drug addicts, even those who may be unaware of their pregnancy in most of the US, resulting in women being forced to maintain pregnancies while being forced to detox from their addictions, give birth to children born with addictions and severe medical problems, and then be charged with harming the fetus they didn’t even know they were carrying until it was too late.

Scenario 4: Blood, tissue, and organ donation.

Getting off of the topic of pregnancy, we’re going to move on here, because removing bodily autonomy doesn’t only affect pregnant women. You cannot use a medical condition to remove rights from a person of sound mind, therefore the right would have to be removed from all Americans.

Patient D is in need of a new kidney. Potential Donor E is a perfect match, but does not wish to be a living donor. Without the right of bodily autonomy, patient D’s right to life outweighs Potential Donor E’s right to refuse the donation. As a result, Potential Donor E is forced to undergo organ donation to save the life of Patient D.

An alternate scenario in this. Patient F needs a heart transplant to survive. Potential Donor G was in an automobile accident and while on life support is brain dead, making him a candidate for organ donation. His heart is a perfect match for Patient F. However, Potential Donor G’s religious beliefs state that he must be buried with his body intact. This is important to Potential Donor G and his family, and would prevent donation of any of Potential Donor G’s organs. Unfortunately for Potential Donor G and his family, Patient F’s right to life supersedes Potential Donor G’s right to determine if his body can be used in this manner, Potential Donor G’s body is harvested for organs, Patient F receives his heart, and Potential Donor G cannot receive the funeral and burial required by his religious beliefs.

Scenario 5: Rape.

Bodily autonomy is the right that says a person gets to decide what another person can do with their body. If we do not have the right to refuse someone else the use of our bodies, then where is the crime in rape? In particular date rape, or rape of unconscious individuals where the victim is not beaten or physically injured other than the rape itself. We already see this happening in cases like that of Brock Turner, who was given a light sentence for raping an unconscious woman. Part of the justification of his sentence was that a “promising athlete” shouldn’t have his life ruined for “twenty minutes of action”, as stated in a letter written by Turner’s father to the judge as a plea for leniency for his son. When we remove the right of bodily autonomy, this becomes the case of all rapes like this. Rape is no longer viewed as a violation of another person’s bodily autonomy, because that bodily autonomy no longer exists. It becomes a matter of punishing the rapist for “twenty minutes of action” as in the case of Brock Turner. The violation of Turner’s victim’s bodily autonomy wasn’t considered in his judgement, or at the least wasn’t considered to be more worthy of protection than Turner’s status as a student and athlete.

While yes, this is a slippery slope argument, it is important to remember that slippery slopes do exist, and when it comes to removing rights from individuals, slippery slopes are especially dangerous.",Morning_Light_Dawn,173,1943,0.5600000023841858,0.2566197804189928,1725430776,/r/changemyview/comments/1f8mci4/cmv_abortion_is_an_absolute_right/,2024,9
1fctdjq,CMV: Universal Healthcare is less expensive and more efficient than the private American model,"Universal healthcare is actually way more efficient than the system we have in the U.S., and despite what some people say, it won’t bankrupt the country. Plenty of countries have made universal healthcare work for them without sinking their economies. Take Canada and the UK, for example: they’ve had universal healthcare for decades and, overall, spend way less per person than the U.S. does. According to a report from The Commonwealth Fund, the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on healthcare as these other countries but has worse outcomes in key areas like life expectancy and chronic illness management.

A common argument against universal healthcare is that it would be too expensive and would require higher taxes, which could cripple the economy. But here's the thing, Americans are already paying a lot for healthcare, just in different ways. Instead of paying higher taxes, most people are dealing with expensive insurance premiums, copays, and surprise medical bills. While taxes might go up with universal healthcare, people would actually save more money because they wouldn’t be paying for private insurance or out-of-pocket costs. Plus, a single-payer system would allow the government to negotiate drug prices, which could further lower costs overall.

Some people point to long wait times in countries like the UK to argue that universal healthcare doesn’t work. Yes, the UK has had issues with wait times, but it’s not like the U.S. system is any better when it comes to accessing care. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Americans often have to wait just as long, if not longer, to see specialists, especially if they don’t have good insurance. And let’s not forget that a lot of Americans avoid going to the doctor at all because they’re worried about the costs, even if they have insurance. So, the argument about wait times doesn’t hold up when you consider the whole picture.

Another reason universal healthcare is more efficient is that it cuts down on the massive administrative costs that come with private insurance. Right now, a huge chunk of U.S. healthcare spending goes toward paperwork, insurance claims, and bureaucracy, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). With universal healthcare, you could eliminate most of those costs, allowing more money to go directly to patient care instead of getting lost in administrative overhead.

In the end, the U.S. is already spending a ton on healthcare but getting mediocre results compared to countries with universal systems. By switching to a more efficient system that focuses on prevention and removes the need for private insurers, we could improve outcomes and reduce overall costs without bankrupting the country. Other countries have figured it out, and there's no reason the U.S. can’t do the same.",TheAntiCoomLord,1206,967,0.8299999833106995,0.25541232677626535,1725898589,/r/changemyview/comments/1fctdjq/cmv_universal_healthcare_is_less_expensive_and/,2024,9

The fake elector scheme, telling Pence not to certify the results, having states individually not certify the results, are all such damaging and despicable acts, that even if they agree with him on policy, should have stopped Republicans from voting for him in the primaries and even the general election. 

There’s no compelling evidence the 2020 election was rigged. Most of the federal judiciary at the time and the Supreme Court was made up of Republicans, many of whom were appointed by Trump, and yet Trump still lost in court. He and his supporters make plenty of claims in public, but as soon as they were under oath and had to submit evidence subject to cross examination, they had none. 

Trump’s attempt to subvert our democracy is so incredibly damaging. It’s incredibly dangerous to set a precedent where the party that loses the election can remain in power anyway. Dictatorship is almost universally a bad idea with bad outcomes. 

The arguments that Democrats do the same thing are so poor, I’m skeptical they are being made in good faith. There are one or two comments Hillary has made since losing that I think are damaging and that she shouldn’t have made, but it’s not comparable to what Trump did. Hillary conceded and did not try to remain in power after losing. She did not try to pursue illegal or unethical schemes to remain in power. Gore challenged the vote in Florida when he had a legitimate reason to think he might have won, and once he lost, he conceded and did not try to remain in power. 

If a Dem had done what Trump did, I would absolutely vote for a McCain or a Romney over the dem. Democracy is too important. 

The only possible exception to the argument that I see is for people who actually believe abortion is 100% truly murder. Unlike the 2020 election which was demonstrably not rigged, abortion is a murkier philosophical question so I find it difficult to simply dismiss their view even if I disagree with it. It is also hard for me to advocate for someone to vote for a party that is pushing for the legalization of murder.

1frekic,CMV: The “both sides” political argument is stupid ,"The voters out there that are either voting third party or not voting at all because “both sides do evil things” or “both sides support x, y, z and i can’t vote for that”. Not to mention the types of voters that somehow believe both Trump and Harris are the same type of person. Ironically, these are the same people that claim to stand for equal rights, lgbtq+ rights, and a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. If they actually stood for the rights of those individuals theyd vote for the only candidate with a chance of winning that will protect those individuals. Every time someone brings up the “both sides” argument i immediately notice how privileged they must be to feel that way. As a member of the lgbtq+ community i feel like this election will personally affect my life and it upsets me to see others waste their vote like that.

1f90400,CMV: The lack of empathy towards people who want paternity tests and prenups is completely unfair,"It's not fair in the slightest to get mad at your husband for ""not trusting you"" knowing damn well that it's something you'll never have to worry about. It's a guarantee that the child is yours as the mother, why do you get to be 100% certain but your partner is an asshole for wanting the same degree of certainty? It demonstrates a complete lack of empathy in my opinion.

 30% of paternity tests come back negative, an absolutely staggering amount. Why is your partner a bad person for making sure that they don't dedicate their entire life to a child that isn't even theirs? Seriously, imagine being 60 years old and finding out that your 20 something year old children were never even yours, that's suicide inducing shit. 

Same goes with prenups. If you're the person who doesn't have the money, it's once again totally unfair to expect your partner put all of their assets on the line in the name of ""trust"". You're bringing nothing into the relationship, which means you have nothing to lose. It's easy to judge people when they have to make a difficult decision that you will never have to make. 

  
I simply believe in equality in a relationship. If you get 100% certainty that our child is yours, then so should I, and if you get to have 100% certainty that you wont lose anything important if we divorce, then so should I. I genuinely cannot understand how these are controversial opinions.

1fjszld,CMV: I have very little sympathy with Hezbollah with regards to the exploding pager attacks,"I'm sure you've all seen the news by now, that a few thousand Hezbollah-owned pagers have exploded in Lebanon, causing wide-ranging injuries (and a small number of deaths) to the people who were using those pagers.

Israel have not commented on this incident, but for the sake of this argument, I'm going to assume that it was organised and carried out on behalf of (or directly by) Israel.

The background for this is, of course, the war which has been raging since October. After the Hamas attacks in Israel, Israel have been conducting a war in Gaza, in and around the south of Israel.

Israel were not fighting against Hezbollah at this time. They were in the south of Israel, fighting with Hamas. But Hezbollah chose to join the war. They chose to fire rockets at the north of Israel. They chose to bring the war to the north. That is the first reason why I have little sympathy for Hezbollah right now. But I'm also aware that the fighting did not start in October last year, there is a long and complicated history to the fighting, and the relationships between the many parties involved are complex. So I don't think that this argument is, in itself, enough to justify my position.

But my second point is that Israel, in attacking Hezbollah in this way, have done exactly what the international community have asked them to do. They have been widely criticised for their tactics in Gaza and the number of civilians that have been killed. The pager attacks have also affected a number of civilians, that much is true - but the nature of the attacks means that it was very deliberately targeting Hezbollah members, and doing everything possible to avoid impacting civilians. The number of civilians injured/killed will, I'm sure, be far less (by percentage) than in Gaza, or in any other war that has happened in recent times. The pagers were owned by Hezbollah members. The explosions were timed to go off when Hezbollah members would have been handling the pagers, not when they were left lying on a table in their family homes where family members might have been the closest person to them. This is an incredibly clever attack in that it targets a very specific group of individuals - it will have far less collateral damage than bombing, or attacks by ground forces, for example.

What will not change my view here is an argument that any civilian deaths are unwelcome. Of course civilian deaths are unwelcome, but that is not realistic when there is a war on. Of course we would rather that there was no war, but that is not the subject of this CMV. The facts are that there is a ware, that Hezbollah chose to join that war (or at least its most recent phase), and that this attack by Israel really does seem to be targetting Hezbollah members and minimising collateral damage.

What might change my view is anything that shows that Hezbollah were drawn into the war (the current phase of the war, since October 2023) by Israel against their will, or anything that shows that Israel were targetting civilians in these attacks. I don't believe that either of those are true, and because they are not true that I hold this view, but if you can show that either of those assertions are false it's likely to get a delta.",LondonPilot,203,1616,0.6000000238418579,0.2201722081857277,1726666585,/r/changemyview/comments/1fjszld/cmv_i_have_very_little_sympathy_with_hezbollah/,2024,9
1fnwlrq,CMV: “Racism = prejudice + power” misunderstands what racism is,"
I’m a leftist and this argument is used a lot by leftists as a way to brush off interpersonal racism against white people, but I think this is harmful because it unnecessarily combines the definitions of interpersonal and systemic racism, and it’s important to distinguish the two.

90% of the time people who complain about anti-white racism are full of shit but the right way to deal with it is to either ignore them or confront them on their argument directly. I think it’s fair to say that interpersonal racism against whites is less of a problem for a lot of reasons (either because it’s less common, it doesn’t tap into trauma in the same way it does for POC, or it has less severe effects because anti-white rhetoric doesn’t affect whites systematically). But because those arguments are more complicated and people don’t wanna take the effort to make them, they come up with this new definition of racism that makes no sense and just serves to shut up people who don’t agree with it.

If interpersonal racism is only valid when accompanied by systemic racism, asian americans who aren’t first-gen immigrants can’t experience racism, since they don’t experience racism systemically. Other racial minorities can’t experience racism from black americans since black people suffer from systemic racism in america more than any other group by far, and therefore have less power in society.

If interpersonal racism was defined by the existence of systemic racism, there would be no need to distinguish the two. But it’s really important to understand the differences between types of racism so we can be specific when talking about racism and discussing its consequences. If this means acknowledging that white people can technically experience racism, that’s fine and doesn’t contradict the struggles of racial minorities. I also think turning the definition of racism into an equation is trying to “quantify” racism and turning it into oppression olympics which is always unhelpful.

I want my view changed because if there’s a good reason for me to agree with the “prejudice + power” statement, I wanna know about it.",Ill-Cat4533,826,928,0.7599999904632568,0.20732785645907206,1727128646,/r/changemyview/comments/1fnwlrq/cmv_racism_prejudice_power_misunderstands_what/,2024,9

I've noticed the police in my short lifespan go from hawking profilers to being so lax they will see a crime happening right in front of them and just ask the perpetrator to move along. 

I go to the grocery store almost every day and over the last few years I've noticed the influx of people just walking In and walking out with shopping carts loaded with food and booze. The workers tell me the police won't do anything unless it's a felony charge. 

So now they have their own ARMED security and even they can only do so much without a threat of violence. 

Drug use is rampant on the street I can't go out for a bike ride without seeing at least one pilo being smoked out of let alone not see a needle or two.

From my perspective, Trump has all of the bad qualities of a politician with none of the good. He's a pathological liar, he's obsessed with power (to the point where he wanted to stop counting votes when he was winning, despite numerous news sources explicitly saying there was a high possibility of a red mirage.) He keeps claiming voter fraud, but does not have enough evidence to get a case in front of a court. When the team picked by him- the cyber ninjas- counted the votes themselves they found *more* votes for Biden.

1fgobko,"CMV: If you support Trump, you don't care about our country","With all the information out there, I don't understand how anybody could support Trump if they have the countries best interests in mind. My biggest issue with Trump is the Jan 6th insurrection and fake elector scheme in which he tried to essentially overrule the will of the voters and the constitution.

Not only does he not regret anything that happen that day, but he still doesn't admit he lost and just continues to lie saying the election was stolen (there is no evidence of such). He also wants to pardon the Jan 6th rioters, he hired a VP in Vance who said he WOULD NOT have certified the vote if he was in Mike Pence's shoes which would have meant overruling the guardrails holding our democracy in place. He is also saying that THIS upcoming election is already rigged, so why does anybody give him the benefit of the doubt that he would put the constitution above his own selfish interests in any scenario? This is also a man who threatens to jail anybody who participated in the 2020 election ""fraud"" in which he lost every single court case and there is no evidence. Moreover the supreme court ruling essentially giving presidents immunity is very disconcerting to me.

How can any voter in good conscious vote for someone like Trump knowing this? I'm not even going to get into Trump rhetoric and obvious selfishness because I think my view is strong enough just based on the Jan 6th/Fake elector scheme event.

1fc3l7o,cmv: there is no reason sex work should be illegal,"The number 1 argument against it is that there is a potential for sex trafficking, but this doesn't mean you ban the practice as a whole, the logical next step is that you make the job safer (which could be better done if it was regulated), not ban it unless inherently the position had some aspect of sex trafficking to it, , we wouldn't and don't apply this logic to most other facets of life, (don't drive cars because you could die in a car crash), and especially not other jobs, the reason it's illegal can't be solely based on how much harm it causes. 

The second most common argument is that it is inherently coercive, that the sex worker is inherently in a lesser position of power, and it is not completely consensual from both sides, in this case, I don't know why sex would be someone magically different than any other scenario where some inherent aspect of the person is being used for monetary gain (ignoring the fact that sex work isn't entirely based on the body of the worker anyway). You could certainly argue that by nature of their life circumstances, a mcdonalds employee is pressured into working in a job they don't want in the same way sex work couldn't be considered technically consensual because the sex worker isn't doing it for their own enjoyment necessarily, but because they have to because of life circumstances.

1fd3qbw,"CMV: Regardless of where you stand on the abortion debate, the ""unborn"" should always have fewer rights than those who are born. ","I think it's ridiculous that anyone thinks the rights of the ""unborn"" should even come close to the rights of the born. People in my conservative family and hometown all firmly believe that unborn embryos and fetuses deserve the same rights as born babies. To me, the issue can be simplified by a very simple thought experiment. 

*You find yourself in a fertility clinic that is burning down. You estimate that you have about 5 minutes to escape. You're standing next to a random toddler that's looking at you for help. You are also aware of 50 frozen embryos nearby and you know you can save a few of them if you hurry, but you can't carry very many if you're also carrying the toddler. You see three choices and have to act quick, which one do you choose?*

*1. Pick up the toddler and run out of the building as fast as you can*

*2. Pick up the toddler and try to save as many frozen embryos and run out of the building as fast as you can*

*3. Try to save as many frozen embryos as possible and leave the toddler behind*

To me, the **only** sane answer is 1. You pick up the toddler and run out of the building as fast as you can. If I chose option 2, I would be risking the toddler's life as well as my own for what I consider an unnecessary risk. Even stopping to save a single frozen embryo (and ensure it is properly stored so it does not thaw out) means precious time lost and potential smoke inhalation for the toddler and me. 

If I choose option 3, I am responsible for the death of the born person no matter how many frozen embryos I save. 

I have posed this scenario to many of my conservative family members and none of them are willing to answer the question and inevitably go off topic. 

I believe that any sane person would always prioritize the safety of the born person. Yet I see very passionate arguments from conservatives about the rights of the unborn, as if the unborn were truly just as human as a born person. 

I am not denying that an unborn embryo or fetus deserve some dignity, that's why we have laws against endangering the unborn. But my real issue is this pervasive idea that the unborn are equal to the born. We can argue about the unborn being ""50%"" or ""80%"" or on a sliding scale of equality as they get closer to being born, but at no point, in my view, does an unborn person have 100% the same value as a baby who is being born right now or is already born.

Violent sexual assault isn’t like other crimes. Most people aren’t going to therapy for years after getting smacked in the face by their parent or sibling as a 6 year old. Many people that were molested, even once, spend years dealing with the fallout from that moment well into adulthood.

1f88sgx,CMV: a one state solution is the worst resolution to the Israeli palestinian conflict ,"
The Nakba was a horrible event, and the occupation and blockade of Gaza have been a complete disaster. The suffering on both sides is appalling, and a ceasefire should have happened ages ago. Frankly, the people responsible for war crimes on either side need to be held accountable under international law. There’s no excuse for allowing this violence to continue unchecked.

Now, about this idea of a one-state solution seriously? It’s hard to picture two groups who’ve been at each other’s throats for decades suddenly living together in one happy state. The level of hatred and mistrust between Israelis and Palestinians isn’t something that just disappears because someone draws new borders. Trying to force them into a single state feels like a recipe for disaster.

The demographics alone would be a nightmare. Depending on the immigration, one group is bound to end up with more power than the other. Whether it’s Jews or Arabs, one side will inevitably dominate politically, economically, and socially, which is just going to fuel even more resentment. And honestly, the last thing this conflict needs is more reasons for people to feel oppressed or sidelined.

In the end, a one-state solution seems like one of the worst ideas out there. The violence wouldn’t magically go away. In fact, it would probably get worse. Both sides have lost too much, and there’s way too much bad blood to think that merging them into a single state would work.

Freedom of religion should only ever be allowed if it does not hurt anybody, including children, and inaction or refusal to do something is harm. 

way's to change my view would be.

1. somehow convincing me that letting a child over religion has any objective reason to happen

2. that since the christian faith and many other faiths can change and cherry pick things they want in the want in there religion to fit into society that somehow its okay for all the others to still kill there kids and not change

1fj9b69,CMV: The view “abortion should be illegal except for cases of rape” is impossible to actually have as a policy in practice.,"Let’s assume every single woman who is a victim of SA reported literally the same day and the man is arrested the same day. Even in this scenario, you’d be lucky to have your rapist charged and convicted within your pregnancy period, and if you did the baby would probably be almost born anyway. Evidence collecting, discovery, motions, trial, getting a verdict takes way more time than people realize. 

I know many of you are thinking “durrr let’s just expedite these trials.” First to that, it’s hilarious seeing the party that has prided itself on defending the rights of accused rapists take that stance, that we should just greatly diminish the rights of the accused and hold an unusually fast trial for one of the most serious crimes there is. Second, even expedited litigation wouldn’t fix the issue. Inevitably there will be disputes and issues before trial, court delays, and other things that push even expedited trials to 6-12 months after the offense.

I haven’t even taken account the fact that basically every rapist that is found takes a long time to identify and arrest, haven’t mentioned that only 10% of crimes are ever solved in the USA, and haven’t made any arguments about how unfair the justice system can be to rape victims. 

TLDR: we could never arrest and convict rapists quick enough (without greatly violating their constitutional rights) as to have a policy of abortions illegal except for rape.

1fdo64a,"CMV: ""white privilege"" would be better discussed if the termed was named something else.","Before I start, want to make this clear I am not here to debate the existence of racial disparities. They exist and are a damaging element of our society.

This is a question about how they are framed. 

I don't believe ""white privilege"" is the most fitting title for the term to describes things like the ability to walk down a street without being seen as a criminal, to have access to safe utilities, or to apply for a job without fear that your name would bar you from consideration. I don't see these as privilege, rather I see that is those capabilities as things I believe everyone inherently deserve.

A privilege, something like driving, is something that can be taken away, and I think framing it as such may to some sound like you are trying to take away these capabilities from white people, which I don't believe is the intent. 

Rather, I think the goal is to remove these barriers of hindrances so that all people may be able to enjoy these capabilities, so I think the phenomenon would be better deacribed as ""black barriers"" or ""minority hinderences"". I am not fixed on the name but you get the gist.

I think to change my mind you would have to convince me that the capabilities ascribed to white privilege are not something we want to expand access to all people as a basic expectation.",Atticus104,425,855,0.6700000166893005,0.15270352893876593,1725990698,/r/changemyview/comments/1fdo64a/cmv_white_privilege_would_be_better_discussed_if/,2024,9

They're as common as they are because the person making the accusation faces no punishments.

The common go to is ""this will stop women from coming forward because a lot of times you can't prove it"". This is a little slight of hand people use. It's not ""if you can't prove it you're going to be punished"" it's ""if you get caught lying you'll be punished"" those are 2 very different things.

It's also telling that no one else has this opinion for other crimes. For example if I have black neighbors and tell everyone ""I saw them break into my house and steal shit"" and then a month later go ""no, I was just mad at them and wanted revenge"" they would support punishment for those false accusations.

You have to have a really fucked up sense of justice where 1 person can make accusations and punish someone and then be let off the hook when they're caught lying. There's no justice for the victim at all. People will say it doesn't happen, but literally everyone knows a person who's life was ruined with a false accusation.

Furthermore, there are so many other sections of our day to day life that require having an ID: buying alcohol, flying, buying cigarettes, driving, buying a gun (a constitutional right).

The backlash against this just seems to me to be political division for the sake of political division. Republicans are introducing the laws and just for the sake of being contrarian, Liberals are opposing it.

While I do generally still have this sentiment, I think it was relatively easy to acknowledge that I was going to die, while still subconsciously distancing myself from the reality of death because ""I still have my whole life ahead of me"" and ""I'm still young"". 

After experiencing some health scares and getting a firmer understanding of just how fleeting our lives are, I've started to feel a deep dread, and sometimes borderline panic attacks, when contemplating death. The infinite void of nothingness. This amazing spark of life, then it's gone *forever*. I know that I won't experience being dead. But still, the idea of nothingness after death terrifies me.

1fpssmp,Cmv: You can absolutely be racist to white people,"I hate when people say that you can't be racist to white people. As far as i'm concerned it means ""i'm racist but i don't wanna take accountability for it so i'm gonna water it down to prejudice and use my marganalization as an excuse"" 

Let's take a look at some definitions of racism and go over them. This is the one you get by google. It comes from oxford languages.


""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.""

First of all. The definition clearly states that racism is typically experienced by minorities/marganalized people but not exclusively. If this was the case then the definition wouldn't have the word ""typically"" in it.

This definition also describes the fact that there are different types of racism (such as interpersonal racism and institutional racism) and white people can absolutely experience racism on an interpersonal level

I'll also go over a second definition by merriam webster

1
: a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race

also : behavior or attitudes that reflect and foster this belief : racial discrimination or prejudice

2
a
: the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another

b
: a political or social system founded on racism and designed to execute its principles

This clearly also describes that racism can manifest in different ways. With what was being described under section 1 would be called interpersonal racism and what would be described under section 2 would  be described as systemic/institutional racism.

People say stuff like ""you can't be racist to white people"" and ""black people can't be racist"" to justify/downplay hatred towards white people. I have even heard that ""hate crime against white people is not a thing"" BUT IT IS A THING. if you committ a crime against someone because of their race it is a hate crime and being marganalized and opressed is not an excuse for that

We need to stop giving BIPOC passes when they say something racist about white people. I see it on tiktok all of the time. I hate it when they call me ""palm colored"" just call me ""white"" or caucasian. I am not going to be anyone's punching bag. You need to realize that the mindset that one race is ""less than"" is exactly what created the system of opression in the first place and if you are truly serious about equality, BIPOC should be held to the same standards as white people. Not to a lesser standard. I honestly think saying that shouldn't even be controversial but here we are.

Hamas seems to align with everything except points 9 and 10. Hamas from what I can tell does not have ties to major corporations. However the leaders of Hamas have stolen billions of dollars. So I don't know if that could be used as proof of point 9, where the wealthy and powerful are protected, or if thats more point 13.  

I can't find info on how Hamas handled domestic law and order before the war started, so I'm not sure  about point 11.   


However Hamas is obsessed with revanchism, which is the desire to reclaim land lost in a war. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanchism)

I'm not sure what role revanchism plays in fascism, but I know if was a meaningful factor in the rise of the Nazis, who wanted to reclaim territory lost in WW1. 

Its a given that Hamas is authoritarian, but I think they are also a fascist organization on top of that. Someone prove me wrong. There are multiple definitions of fascism though, and they don't always align.

1fpsled,"CMV: Americans' current use of the term ""middle-class"" is a out of step with standard English and is a politically-motivated con.","In the broader Anglosphere, the term ""middle-class"" is used to describe the socio-economic class of households that enjoy middle-level incomes but also a suite of social practices. While there is no universal definition, many would include things like a university-level education, salaried position in a profession or ""white-collar"" job, travel abroad, considerable savings and job/financial security and so on.

In the US, the term ""middle-class"" has been co-opted to describe now something closer to what the wider world understands as ""working class"" - people who have paid employment, possibly shiftwork or casualised, often in blue-collar trades, with significant financial precarity. Many American sitcoms show ""middle-class"" (US-sense) families - like *The Simpsons*. A recent [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/02/15/middle-class-financial-security/) poll suggested only 30% of Americans consider a college education a marker of being middle class. This is not how the term is used in the UK, Canada, Australia (or other English-speakers in, for example, India).

The point of the term ""middle-class"" is to indicate there is an economic class ""above"" (in some sense) and ""below"". Using the term ""middle-class"" to describe people who the wider world describe as ""working class"" is a form of flattery (maybe) but also a piece of political theatre: ""hey, you're not on food stamps so you're middle class"" is a great way to deflect from people being systematically exploited in ways out-of-step with other English-speaking countries.

1fhpjya,"CMV: Making a roommate rental posting for ""Gujarati Only"" or ""Filipino Preferred"" is racist","There has been an increase in Canadian urban hubs of seeing immigrants (of different nationalities) post their nationality preference in the listing for a roommate. The law states that shared accommodation is not covered by protections against discrimination. While this has been occurring for over 10 years, it has come more to the forefront as there is a significant housing shortage in those same areas in Canada, and people are more aware of housing issues.

I am also an immigrant. In any roommate posting I've ever made, I posted details about myself, and then assessed whether the other person jived with me. I cannot fathom meeting someone who was a great fit, but rejecting them due to their ethnic background. I never thought to filter by race or ethnicity, since it felt so wrong.

**Summarized Opinion:**

* I'm not questioning the legality of the issue. I believe searching for a roommate on the lifestyle and principles you have is fine. You have to live with them after all. 
* **Stating your own characteristics in a roommate search are fine, eg:** ""I am from the Philippines, speak English and Tagalog, I am a vegetarian, devout Christian, 9-5 job etc""
* **Searching for a roommate with criteria that discriminates on mutable characteristics are fine, eg:** ""I would like a roommate who is clean, quiet, doesn't WFH""
* **Specifying boundaries isn't an issue, eg:** ""I don't drink, so prefer not to have parties or alcohol in the house. I'm a strict religious vegetarian, so we'd need to keep our food separate.""
* **Searching for a roommate using immutable characteristics such as ethnic background**, and by saying ""Gujarati Only"" or ""Chinese Preferred"" **is racist.**

People have said that listing all this out takes too long, isn't it simpler to list the one word that you know will match all your criteria, ie... **your racial/ethnic preference**?

The Christian view of being anti abortion relies on the biblical view of “God is the one who gives life therefore he is the only one who can take life”. Using that biblical perspective you cannot also support the death penalty as god is not the one taking that life. The reason I believe this is there is a lapse in logic when saying one is somehow immoral because god says it is and the other isn’t. The Bible also stipulates that “an eye for an eye” is not a biblical view point. Matthew 5:38-39 says explicitly “You have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That you resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.” 

Something that can change my mind: explicit verses of the Bible that disprove my original assertion

Another logical reason that the death penalty (where statistically 4% people are likely wrongly convicted) is biblically moral but abortion is biblically immoral.

1frimcq,CMV: The stereotype constantly being pushed on reddit and other social medias that Gen Z has it worse than any generation leads to them disassociating and giving up on the hope of a bright future and will be far more harmful than anything the government will ever do/not do. ,"I was talking to a 21 year old the other day who was completely convinced that he was going to be subjected to a lifetime of financial and quality of life misery and he listed off all these reasons, blaming the government, economy, job market. He said he's given up saving money for a house and doesn't think he'll ever get married because the ""country wont be around long enough for it to matter"". After going on that rant, he goes on to talk about the 2 week trip to Europe he just got back from and drives a 2023 car and was wearing designer everything. I

 constantly see this narrative across all social media and especially on reddit that the ""system"" is broken and I don't think its a good thing at all. The government has always been shady, sleazy, corrupt, inept, and there is always something you can point at to place blame if you look hard enough. It's not an excuse to give up on your responsibility of your quality of life, or your moral obligation to try and make the society you live in a better place. 

Gen Z seems to have this attitude that it's not on them to fix anything and that the government should be responsible for their quality of life, and until that magic flip switches they don't need to take accountability for their bad decisions. This is leading to more and more Gen Z's stopping caring about the future, making self destructive decisions for immediate satisfaction, financially and otherwise which makes their lives worse, and then since they are miserable they want everyone else to be miserable, and anyone who isn't miserable got ""lucky"". I think when they get older they will be suffering the consequences of these choices far more than any amount of suffering caused by who is president, what dumb laws are made or not made etc. 

Despite all of the negativity you see on reddit the following are true and don't line up with the narrative that Gen Z has it worse than any other generation:

- Gun violence and violent crime in general has significantly decreased since the 80s and 90s. 

- Police violence has been stagnant, if not declining in the last 20 years. 

- The average IQ of people has increased several points per decade

- Wealth inequality is actually **decreasing** in the US, and decreasing even more rapidly globally

- The job market is basically back to average after the pandemic

- The average lifespan in the US is increasing significantly every year

- Women have far more opportunities and choices for career/lifestyle than ever before

-We are not at risk of overpopulation and natural resources are plenty and we are more efficient than ever at using them

-The worlds hunger problem while not solved, is dramatically better than it was 30 years ago. In the US almost nobody starves to death and those cases are due to severe neglect

Our parents lived through the civil rights movement, vietnam, the cold war, the dot com bubble, 9/11, the 08 housing bubble, the 2012 recession, they ate microwave TV dinners and now are dying of cancer at a much higher rate than ever before. They were the highest risk of dying of covid. I just don't see how unless you lived perpetually online you could think you have it worse right now than anyone before you.",80poundnuts,423,487,0.699999988079071,0.1076083731837244,1727542279,/r/changemyview/comments/1frimcq/cmv_the_stereotype_constantly_being_pushed_on/,2024,9
