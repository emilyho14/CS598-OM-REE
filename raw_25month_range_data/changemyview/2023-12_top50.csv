18rjb74,Cmv: One of the worst things that could happen to a person is being born in a third world country.,"So I’m from Nigeria and I moved to the USA years ago with my father and based on my experiences I believe living in a third world country is one of the worst things to happen to a person. I’ve seen how much my parents have sacrificed just to be in this country. I know how much money my father has paid to get us papers in the United States. I honestly couldn’t even believe he had spent that much money. My dad studied industrial engineering in Nigeria and it didn’t even help him in the United States because most employers see that degree as worthless because he got it in a Nigerian university. He never studied here and so now he has to settle for low wage jobs. My dad works so hard, six days a week and we basically live paycheck to paycheck. It’s tough ngl. I just feel like our lives as a whole would be so much better and stress free if not for the fact that we were born in Nigeria, can see our country falling apart and so now we were forced to make this hard journey here. I was also in Nigeria this summer and the country is rife with so much poverty. This are getting worse every day and the basic amenities I enjoy in the United States are like luxuries over there. While I was in Nigeria, there was a time my electricity went out and we had no electricity for almost an entire day. As a result our water went out and we had to fill up buckets of water at someone else’s house just to be able to wash dishes and flush the toilet. I once spoke to my dad and I asked him “so how does a person in Nigeria live a decent life and fulfill something for themselves” and he told me he doesn’t know. Degrees in Nigeria are almost useless now as there are no jobs whatsoever. 
So in conclusion I feel like being from a third world country is on of the worst things to happen to a person because the struggles of living in one in the first place is stressful,draining and horrible, while the struggles of leaving one is also horrible as you have to endure and sacrifice a lot so either way you will suffer, unless you’re rich I guess.",Various_Beach_7840,1951,743,0.8999999761581421,0.6259749067480502,1703627587,/r/changemyview/comments/18rjb74/cmv_one_of_the_worst_things_that_could_happen_to/,2023,12
18cacyg,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,"I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating.",wettigingss,403,2949,0.5600000023841858,0.6032803690415172,1701886825,/r/changemyview/comments/18cacyg/cmv_dating_is_objectively_harder_for_men_than_it/,2023,12
18m9szu,"CMV: If trump wins it won't be the fault of the left or of young people for not voting, it will be the fault of moderate liberals and centrists for choosing bad candidates in the primaries.","1.  The left and the youth always get blamed whenever republicans win but most if not all of the time it's because moderates force through corporate democrats under the guise of ""electability"" even when that claim is verifiably false (ie: bernie being a stronger head to head matchup against trump than biden was in the polls) even against the complaints of the same people they always accuse of not turning out to vote.
If they want those groups to vote they need to be willing to make a sacrifice and support legitimately good candidates in the primaries even if it makes them uncomfortable, ""vote blue no matter who"" can't just be a slogan to browbeat the left with, it cuts both ways, they need to suck it up and vote blue no matter who even if that blue is a leftist candidate. The best way to get the leftists in your party to show up for the election is to be willing to compromise and support a candidate they can actually get excited about.

2. There is a disparity of motive between the moderates and the left. The left has legitimate moral reason to hate the candidates moderates push through the primaries due to the massive harm and loss of life their foreign policy inflicts upon helpless people abroad as well as the concessions they make to corporations, this is especially prevalent this election cycle with biden overtly funding and vocally supporting the genocide of the Palestinian people in gaza as well as admitting that he himself is a zionist, zionism being an inherently imperialist/fascistic ideology which supports the creation and expansion of an ethnostate.
The moderates however, have no such moral complaints against left leaning candidates and instead base most of their complaints in emotion and fear; making vague statements about them being ""too far left"" or ""not electable enough"" and repeating talking points from McCarthyism/the red scare which have no backing or basis in reality especially seeing as leftist candidates tend to support policies that have much broader appeal than the moderates do on a policy by policy basis and often fare better in direct match-ups against the opposition. This has been proven in real world scenarios as well with left leaning candidates winning in deep red states against republican candidates where the democratic party routinely takes losses when putting forth centrist/corporatist candidates. Essentially the left has a legitimate moral justification whereas moderates are acting out of fear and discomfort and tend to push through candidates that make them feel comfortable even if those candidates are monstrous human beings who shouldn't be allowed anywhere near power.

3. Moderates in the democratic voter base have forced this choice on the left for decades and it always results in a back and forth fight with the party in power switching every few years as things slowly get worse. Whereas in those locations where further left leaning candidates win, those areas tend to stay blue much longer as a result of the people living there seeing the positive effect of the policies left leaning candidates put into place.


4. All this to say that If moderates want to actually win elections, they need to stop supporting candidates that are widely unliked by both sides of the political spectrum and stop blaming ""the left"" when it is observably their fault that this is happening. ""The left"" can't be logically blamed when their candidates are consistently more successful when given the chance in real elections. It's moderates that are costing us elections and it's moderates that will be at fault for the US slipping into a full blown fascist dictatorship if they hand the presidency to trump by putting forth a nominee nobody likes.


Things that won't change my mind:

1. ***""It's actually conservatives fault""*** Yeah, sure I agree, they're bad people and ultimately to blame, but it's a waste of time and effort to try and change their minds. We should focus on groups that actually can change. Those are leftists and moderates and of the two moderates don't have a real justification for continuing to impose their bs on others.

2. ***""but biden did (insert good thing here)""*** Biden/any centrist doing good things on occasion, or even often does not outweigh the lives they take with their foreign policy and it certainly doesn't outweigh outright genocide.

3. Appealing to me personally to vote for him. This isn't about my vote; it's about how if he loses I won't blame leftists/the youth, I'll blame moderates who constantly saddle us with unappealing nominees that are so bad it's more surprising when they win than when they lose.

4. ***""biden doesn't actually have control over what happens in gaza/biden is already trying to stop it""*** This one I've heard a lot recently and the first part is dubious at best, israel could not do what it does without the funding the US gives it and biden has control over that the second part is easily disproven with his own words and actions.",Aberration-13,854,2186,0.6499999761581421,0.5894962352474555,1703013121,/r/changemyview/comments/18m9szu/cmv_if_trump_wins_it_wont_be_the_fault_of_the/,2023,12
18fx9zx,"CMV: If switching the gender/race/any demographic group in a statement makes that statement sound bigoted, then it was bigoted in the first place. Always.","EDIT: I was wrong to use the word ""sound"" in the title. I meant to make it more understandable, but it detracts from my point. Let me rephrase: If switching the demographic group makes it bigoted, then it was bigoted before the switching too. I used ""sound"" because a lot of people can instinctively recognize some forms of bigotry as bigotry but are blind to the exact same reasoning with just a different demographic group swapped in. I used ""sound"" because, these people blind to bigotry again some groups, they will think ""hey, if you switch the demographic groups, it SOUNDS like bigotry"". As a matter of fact, it IS factually bigoted in both scenarios, both before and after the switching - the ""sound"" was purely relating to the ability of people to recognize bigotry as what it is.


For context, I am a gay, black, Senegalese man. I was born and raised in Senegal, then went to university in France and now I live and work in the USA. The observations that follow have all been made in the USA or online in US-centric spaces.

I have personally witnessed a staggering number of times when someone makes a statement that, if made about women/queer folk/PoC, would be decried as abhorrent and bigoted, but since it's made towards men/straight folks/white people is considered ok, even funny and ""progressive"". There is a whole genre of ""humor"" (and multiple big subreddits dedicated to it) about mocking heterosexual people; I have seen PoCs straight up saying that the opinion of a white person is invalid purely because they are white, etc. Generally, those attitudes seem to come from an utter lack of empathy towards those demographics and every time I see it, I cannot stop thinking that the ""progressive"" people acting in this hateful and discriminatory way would themselves happily be MAGA if they weren't themselves PoCs, queer or women. It is the exact same mindset, casual cruelty and refusal to see ""the other"" as a human being that I see in the worst ""traditional bigots"", just with the demographics switched around.

To get ahead of people pointing out systemic disadvantages: Yes, I know that, in the US of A, white people have more institutional power, men are generally better paid and better considered in the workplace, and het people's human rights are largely secure compared to queer people's rights. All of that is correct. However:

- It does not excuse interpersonal hatred or discrimination. Plainly, if you are hateful towards someone you do not know purely because of their birth-assigned characteristics, you are a profoundly terrible human being, NO MATTER what systemic forces are in place. To use a fictional example that won't lead to people jumping at my throat while refusing all rational discussion: Take Scar from the anime Fullmetal Alchemist. He is a survivor from Ishval, member of a racial minority that was slaughtered by the richer Amestrians. Scar's reaction is to go on a murderous rampage during which he kills, among many others, two innocent Amestrian doctors who were healing Ishvalans on the battlefield, then he tries to murder their even-more-innocent underage daughter. Just because they have blonde hair, which is a sign of Amestrians. Scar associates the entire demographic group with evil people (due to trauma, and he has every reason to), yet his blind hatred of all Amestrians IS wrong, because there are many innocent Amestrians.

- The systemic issues present in the USA are really only present in the USA. I have lived on three different continents, including Africa. I have been told time and time again that ""white people have all the power everywhere"" and that ""there is not one place where PoC are systematically advantaged."" I am strongly convinced that those arguments are born from extreme ethnocentrism from Americans who are not even aware that there exists a world outside of the USA. In MOST countries in the world, white people are a minority, and while they are often seen as a ""model minority"", they don't have more power in my native Senegal or in China or Japan or India than Asian-Americans have in the USA.

- The systemic issues in question, even if only look within the USA, were not born by accident. They are the result of the fact *the majority of the population held bigoted beliefs* for long enough for those beliefs to become ""mainstream"". That's really all it takes. If the ""white people are all trash"" and ""kill all men"" mentalities were to become more popular, they WOULD absolutely shift the systemic imbalances to cause systemic discriminations against white people and men respectively. I'd argue that, on a small scale and in some specific contexts, this is already happen. 

In brief: A person who negatively judges and/or treats all members of [demographic group] just because they are members of [demographic group] is a hateful bigot, NO MATTER what that [demographic group] is.

18bff6l,CMV: I don’t think cops deserve automatic respect.,"I feel like most cops were kids that were bullied in high school, have a chip on their shoulder, and enjoy exercising their authority of everyone else.

18ljydd,CMV: Trump's comment saying immigrants are poisoning American blood is racist.,"I was born and raised in Asia. I admit I am racist as other Asians: we talk crap about non-white people all the time. 

Until Trump made the poisoning blood comment, I disagreed with accusations saying Trump is racist as he somewhat drew a clear line between attacking someone based on their race and based on immigration status or religious beliefs. But man, ""poisoning our blood""? This is a dangerous statement not only because was used by the Nazis but also because it implies certain blood is ""clean"" and certain blood is ""poisonous"". Trump did not specify what blood is clean but it can be easily deduced from the demographic of the crowd listening to that statement.

First off dreads originate from African regions dating back thousands of years and hold a religious and cultural significance, furthermore Buddhist, Christian and Hindu religions wore dreadlocks. Moving forward in time vikings adopted this hairstyle and at some point through time most cultures/ethnicities used this hairstyle. So dreadlocks aren't just subject to black culture there subject to most if not all cultures. I dont believe that someone shouldn't be allowed to have a hair style because it's part of someone's culture.

18rl1qx,CMV: It's really weird that the Holocaust has been completely claimed by Jews,"Just a few to things to make 100% clear. I am absolutely not denying that 6 million Jews were killed in an attempt of genocide by Nazi Germany. This is not an attempt to revise the Holocaust or deny any part of it. Quite the opposite, actually. I am also not saying in any way that Jews cannot or should not claim victim hood. They were massively victimized and are still today. These are not part of my point at all.

Something that's been bothering me for a while is that the Holocaust has been broadly accepted and talked about as purely a genocide against Jews. Most people I know who I've talked to about WWII or the Holocaust think that there were only (relatively speaking, of course) 6 million Holocaust victims. This is not true. There were 6 million victims who were Jewish. There was another 5-6 million who were not Jewish, but disabled, LGBT, and non Jewish ethnic/racial minorities. Anyone ""degenerate"" or ""inferior"".

You may be wondering why it matters. Here's why it bothers me:
1. Nearly half of the victims of the Holocaust are practically erased by only focusing on the 6 million Jews. It's not right to suggest 6 million is inflated and it's not right to only speak on half of the victims of the Holocaust, in my view.
2. Fascism of all kinds have similar strategies and talking points, but the Nazis and Hitler gained a special level of hatred among the general population, seemingly globally. Only focusing on the anti-Semitic propaganda and tropes causes us to miss propaganda and tropes of other groups from the same source. This is happening in the US towards several minority groups, but the parallels are ignored because we're not educated on ALL of the trash Nazi Germany pumped out and perpetrated.

To change my view, you need to explain why my concerns are moot and/or that the other 5-6 non Jewish deaths are not as ignored as I feel they are.

Also, I'm an American speaking on what I experience in America and online in mostly American communities. I don't know how Holocaust education or discourse is outside of the US.

Edit: I figured this wouldn't take too long. I had assumed that other groups were treated just as bad as Jews were, but that was incorrect. There's also the fact that the Jewish population is the only group victimized that did not significantly recover from the same event. Also, I didn't realize that ""Holocaust"" is literally a term used for the Jewish deaths exclusively and the other murders are considered separately. These things have changed my view.

18h3pt5,CMV: There is little a man can do to protect himself from false rape / sexual assault allegations,"For emphasis, this view is about **false** rape allegations.  Obviously, a man can protect himself from factual rape allegations by not raping.

I'll use gendered language in the is post, but genders can be reversed.

I can think of two types of false rap allegations:

1. Malicious allegations.  These are situations where a woman knows she wasn't raped, but makes the accusation as some type of vendetta against the man, or to protect herself from ridicule or negativity.

2. Mistaken allegations.  These are situations where the woman fully believes she was raped, but the situation that occurred does not meet the legal definition of rape.  Legally, she validly consented to sex, even if she regretted granting that consent later.

For malicious allegations, there is essentially nothing a man can do to protect himself.  Even avoiding sex all together doesn't protect against malicious allegations.  Some malicious allegations could be avoided by making specific efforts to not piss women off, but that does little for, say, a situation where a woman falsely claims rape because she doesn't want her parents to know she consented to sex.

Mistaken allegations provide for more avenues of protection for men, but at some point you just have to take your partner at their word that they are consenting to the sex and are consenting for the right reasons.  So ""repeatedly checking in and reading body language"" is really the best protection for men attempting to avoid mistaken false allegations.

But if your partner is telling you that they want to have sex (either with words or actions), when they really don't want to have sex, what is a man to do?  It's reasonable to take her at her word, but you never really know if she's consenting because she wants sex, or if it's because she is afraid of what you'll do if she says no, or because she had a couple glasses of wine, or because she thinks it means you'll be her boyfriend.  And if it turns out to be some reason *other* than that she actually wanted to have sex, the man is at risk of being falsely accused.

Note that the examples I provided above as protections a man can take to avoid false rape allegations fall within the ""little"" a man can do.  So responses of ""look at your own post, there are lots of things a man can do"" won't sway my opinion.",THEpassionOFchrist,279,1888,0.5799999833106995,0.39161030531160257,1702429498,/r/changemyview/comments/18h3pt5/cmv_there_is_little_a_man_can_do_to_protect/,2023,12

However I don't know how it isn't true. 

For example..many men say older women are used and if men are still single they would date younger prettier women. This makes me think men only care about women's body and not our hearts. My skills my talents etc..

And I think its kind of true  I've tried experiments. With older profiles and younger ones. I look the same and yet the younger age gets more matches. Its a scary thought that men, no matter how old THEY are dont want older women with experience.

18tm3i8,CMV: Social media is destroying western society slowly like a cancer.,"When people spend so much time looking at what other people are doing, they lose all creativity and chase what is “cool”. They’re wasting time on their phone accomplishing nothing other than increasing their jealousy and anxiety while they can be spending that time being productive. All independence and privacy has gone out the window to oversharing and following meaningless trends. 

TikTok is the worst iteration of this. The algorithm is specifically made to influence young people’s worldview. From the moment you create an account you’re bombarded with dangerous messaging. Gen Z is completely addicted to this, and the platform is now where the youngest generation is receiving their news. Why does China have a different version of TikTok? It’s almost like they know it’s poison, so they don’t want to give it to their youth, but are happy to give it to western youth.

18enrh2,"CMV: The criticism of Hitler's paintings as ""ugly"" is not based off of the quality of Hitler's art itself, but rather, the critics' dislike of Hitler as a person.","You would be hard pressed to find a single art critic who holds a neutral or positive view of Adolf Hitler's paintings; they near-unanimously criticize his paintings as *ugly, lacking talent, lacking merit,* etc.

Now, whether one likes Hitler's paintings or not is entirely subjective (you can Google them for yourself and see what you think of them. Most of them are sketches or paintings of buildings, architecture, mountains, scenery, etc.) But I can't help but suspect that the real reason Hitler's art is criticized so heavily by art critics is because they are afraid of the political consequences of saying anything remotely positive about it, especially in the era of social media and cancel culture.

To put it another way, if, say, Barack Obama, Greta Thunberg or Martin Luther King Jr. had painted those **exact same** paintings - or if you showed Hitler's paintings to some art critic without that critic knowing who the painter was - I strongly suspect those same art critics would either hold a neutral/noncritical view or be praising the paintings/sketches as *artistic, beautiful, well-drawn,* etc. 

Whether Hitler's paintings are good or not has absolutely nothing to do with him being a genocidal tyrant. CMV",SteadfastEnd,876,546,0.7400000095367432,0.31707401009368386,1702157917,/r/changemyview/comments/18enrh2/cmv_the_criticism_of_hitlers_paintings_as_ugly_is/,2023,12

Our leaders should be the best of us, not just the lesser of two shitheads

This is a large part of the reason why i loved Obama despite not being a democrat. He was the perfect leader. Physically and mentally strong, brilliant and charismatic to a fault. He was a damn near perfect human being, regardless of his policies. 

When other nations look at our president they should expect them to reflect us. We should only have the best of the best, the creme de la crop of our society run for office. 

The smartest, most cunning, strongest, charismatic, youthful. The best of us, not the worst.

I’ll concede on the following:

- Upper age limit should be 65, not 50

- I don’t know how to measure how smart someone is. I know IQ tests suck. I will have to delta you if you make me try to actually implement this as opposed to dream it. I will still hold thag only smart people should be allowed to run

18fx9i0,"CMV: Biden / Dems have failed immensely by not raising taxes on the wealthy, which would be beneficial to the United States economy","Dems campaign heavily on taxing the ""rich"" and reducing wealth disparity.  However we have seen basically none of that.  I think taxing the rich would reduce wealth disparity, reduce inflation, and lower the deficit, and would be overall a boon to the US economy at large, and that Dems have totally failed to implement any laws to do this in spite of their promises to do just that.

I am not necessarily talking about anything like the 90% taxes like we've seen historically, or even necessarily a ""wealth"" tax.  Even something like increasing capital gains tax to match income taxes would be reasonable, and increasing the top brackets / creating new brackets for people making 10s of millions.

To clarify my points: taxing the wealthy:

A. Would reduce the deficit

B. Would reduce inflation without taxing the poor/middle class

C. Would reduce wealth disparity and many of the negative symptoms of it

D. Could be implemented in a reasonable, measured way

E. Is something the Dems have routinely promised and failed to deliver, and these days they fail to even bring up the topic

F. Fiscal policy is extremely important and the Dems are at best clowns and at worst immoral in failing to address it.

At the risk of getting away from the subject, I would also argue that many of the topics Dems focus on pale in comparison to the importance of good fiscal policy, and Dems pander with social issues instead of fixing economic issues that would have magnitudes higher benefit to the poor and middle class they claim to champion.

I would also argue Trump failed by slashing taxes during a booming economy prior to the pandemic.  The Republicans are obviously don't even pretend to want to raise taxes on the wealthy, which is why I didn't bring them up.

18t6eoz,Cmv: The majority of people supporting Palestine in the west don't know what they are really supporting.,"I will start out by saying the Palestinians have been mistreated by Israel and surrounding Arab states and need a state but I believe Israel has a right to exist. A 2 state solution which I think is the majority view of people in the west not involved directly in the conflict.

When the college presidents were before Congress being wishy washy about the calls for genocide being a violation of the code of conduct I really believe one of the reasons was to protect there students. With the river to the sea slogan when used in the past and to certain extent today by Palestinians means a call for all Jewish people to be removed from the area and I dont think students really are aware of that so I don't think the majority of them chanting it were actually calling for genocide in their eyes even though through a lot of peoples eyes they were. I don't think students should be exspelled for not understanding the full context of a slogan and I think the college presidents understood that. A lot of students had no idea what river and what sea it was even referring too.

Another big thing I see is the right of return and a call for democratic state where both people live together I personally don't see how this doesn't end horribly for everyone involved if you snapped your fingers and made this a reality tomorrow. Even a structured right of return not overnight would end in escalation in hostility between both groups that would be a net negative for both people in my opinion. This is an amazing dream for well into the future but this is not a reality now. To give an example imagine if Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi people all returned to there homes from before partition and they were all one state do you think that goes well at all? I wish in perfect world it did but that's not the reality. I really don't think a lot of people protesting in the street realize the consequences that full right of return would have with tensions being so high.

My last point is some people portraying Israeli's as white and Palestinians as non white. I think most of the people in general would not be able to pick out who was Palestinian or Israeli in a line up. This I think comes from Americans ideas on race which don't really apply to this conflict and makes me think a lot of people saying this have never actually met a Palestinian or Israeli or even read up or watched anything longer then a Instagram story on it. 

Obviously I have a bit of bias towards Israel and I acknowledge that but I am wondering if I am way off base in my thinking?",wonwonwo,375,1227,0.5899999737739563,0.3041411843471251,1703802210,/r/changemyview/comments/18t6eoz/cmv_the_majority_of_people_supporting_palestine/,2023,12

And in the same way as that slogan, perhaps someone just means the South will recover economically or culturally or whatnot.

In exactly the same sense, yelling out a slogan about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which is entirely consistent with the Hamas Charter, which originally included a quote about rocks & bushes yelling out ""a jew is hiding here, kill him"", is too ambiguous for someone to seriously claim it's not intended (at least when Rashida Tlaib & others say it) to threaten Jews w/ genocide.

This picture is quite similar to [Dresden's bombing](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/181z60z/map_of_dresden_bombing_in_ww2_which_was/), [Cambodia's bombing](https://data.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/dataset/402115c8-03aa-4ae3-8609-ae993632f941/resource/02cd54f0-5bd0-47a9-ae8c-6d14da4a5de8/download/us-bombing-1965-75.jpg), and  [Laos bombing](https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/16b8zfm/map_of_the_bombs_that_were_dropped_on_laos_by_the/). Nearly *all* infrastructure in Gaza City, used by militants or not, are destroyed, fitting the definition of indiscriminate bombings. 

A few things to address:

* If you want to say that ""only"" 20,000 died, suggesting a low death to bomb ratio, fine, but bombing campaigns are aimed at *infrastructure*, so as long as the kind of infrastructure attacked is indiscriminate, the campaign is indiscriminate.

* If you want to say Hamas hides themselves in civilians, I'm referring to infrastructure used by militants _or not_. Unless you believe that 95%+ of all buildings in Gaza City are used by militants, then it's indiscriminate.

* Don't bring up genocide. I'm not accusing Israel of genocide in this post, so I won't entertain that rebuttal.

To close this out, here are some quotes:

> “There is one and only (one) solution, which is to completely destroy Gaza before invading it. I mean destruction like what happened in Dresden and Hiroshima, without nuclear weapons,” Moshe Feiglin, the founder of Israel's right-wing Zehut Party and former Likud representative in Israel’s parliament 
 
> “Gaza should be razed and Israel’s rule should be restored to the place."" Moshe Feiglin, the founder of Israel's right-wing Zehut Party and former Likud representative in Israel’s parliament  

>  “The emphasis is on damage, not accuracy,” declared the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).  

> “Gaza will eventually turn into a city of tents,” said one IDF official, adding, “There will be no buildings.”  

> Israel’s economy minister, Nir Barkat, told ABC News that hostages and civilian casualties will be secondary to destroying Hamas, “even if takes a year”.  

> Israel’s former chief military advocate general and the country’s former attorney general no less, who declared that to destroy Hamas “then you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas”.

I have also tried doing these things without making other people feel excluded and explaining ideas in a simple manner, but seems like most people just care about surface level discussions and somehow think discussing anything in depth makes you a pretentious narcissist.  
And this is not just limited to personal experience. In most scenarios, people club anyone bringing up anything remotely intelligent as pretentious and feel the need to one up the person by clubbing him/her into categories like r/iamverysmart or something similar. Its such a disgrace. I also feel like this stems from an anti-elitist mentality but even that is harmful for us as it hinders innovation and lateral thinking.  


However I agree that I may be wrong, so please feel free to give reasons as to why this kind of behavior is justified. And like I said, this is not just from personal experience even though that plays its own part, but this is a sentiment I have seen being echoed very frequently no matter which kind of circle you are in, so please keep that in mind as well before criticizing me or assuming that somehow I am a douche who is trying to justify his actions by calling other people out.

It's estimated that [250,000 to 500,000 Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_Holocaust) were murdered, about 25-50% of the Romani population at the time. A scholar even estimated that 1.5 million Romani might have died out of a population of 2 million. 

I did not learn about this until recent months, and I'm sure many reading this post aren't aware either. Their Holocaust was only recognised by West Germany in 1982, and many official recognitions only came about in the 2000s. The reason for that is complicated but probably due to a combination of strong anti-Roma racism in Europe, especially Eastern Europe, the lack of collective memory and the lack of documentation.

They also make arguments for emulating how other countries control guns. (UK, Canada, Japan). While at the same time saying they don’t want to ban guns. I find this contradictory because those countries have guns banned. So if you make that argument you’re essentially arguing to ban guns.

The sole defining characteristic of the genre is the sexualization of specifically prepubescent girls.

A cynic might point out that ‘fighting’ some amorphous spectre of ‘racism’ with a few D&I schemes is much cheaper for the Goldman & Sachs’ of the world than actually trying to solve wealth inequality.

The best argument for the focus on race has been to look at outcomes. Minorities tend to have disproportionately worse health care outcomes, education, incarceration etc. 

But in the U.K. at least, when you control for socioeconomics, these outcome gaps disappear almost completely. With white children even fairing worse than minorities with respect to education outcomes.

It would seem that the racial inequality we see today is largely the result of wealth inequality, rather than deliberate racism - institutional or individual.

Instead of focusing on helping the poor, we spend our time teaching wealthy kids they are ‘oppressed’ because of the identity group they belong to. Creating a atmosphere of paranoia, assuming every other person is a secret racist/bigot.

18ukstx,cmv: It is not possible for there to be “equal” reproductive rights between men and women.,"
So would consider myself to be pro choice when it comes to abortion rights which is a position that needs not much of an explanation. I do see a lot of people talk about giving men the right to “financially abort” their child in an attempt to even the playing field when it comes to reproductive rights. I think this is not a good idea. I think that it is not realistic to strive for equality in this situation.

Firstly the outcomes are different. I’m not going to get into the weeds if when a baby becomes alive or whatever. Frankly I don’t really care. I’ll just be honest. If a woman decides to get an abortion while her partner doesn’t want her to. The woman still reserves the right to get an abortion or not because it is wrong to force the woman to carry a pregnancy she does not want to because the man who knocked her up said so. The it works reversed as well, it’s wrong to force a woman to get an abortion.

Now let’s look at the other side which people are worried about. A man wants to not have a kid, but the woman doesn’t want to get an abortion. I think we can all agree it’s barbaric for a man to be able to force a woman to get an abortion. So she doesn’t get an abortion. Now things change. There is a child. The child has to eat, has to wear clothes, and be taken care by the parents.

It been observed that it is best for a child to have two active parents for financial and time reasons. Removing the other financial stream impacts the child above all else. That’s bad. And because there is now a child present the parents have to take some form of responsibilty, whether they want to or not (for both parents).

So now you can say this is unfair, however I think that given the nature of how child bearing works, it’s not possible for there to be equal rights because there isn’t an equal distribution and an equal end result when someone is pregnant without either making it so that women are forced to physically carry a baby she doesn’t want to carry, or robbing a child of much needed fincancial support.",Left_Sense_3060,288,1054,0.6899999976158142,0.25251294907672706,1703957484,/r/changemyview/comments/18ukstx/cmv_it_is_not_possible_for_there_to_be_equal/,2023,12

By moving a Navy ship into the South China Sea, the US forces all countries nearby to be defensive again. Millions of Ukrainian lives are dependent on whether the US approves military aid or not. And of course, by installing a few CIA agents in a foreign country, it has the capability to reshape the societal and political picture of a country completely.

18g78m1,CMV: The only way to stop Trump is to vote for Biden,"Voting third party is equivalent to putting your ballot in the woodchipper for one reason: only Biden or Trump (or whoever the Democrats & Republicans nominate) can be elected because that's how FPTP works. Therefore, the only way to stop Trump is to vote for the Democratic nominee, whether it's Biden, your Aunt Sadie, or the Berenstein Bears. And this should be a good outcome for third parties because Trump leaked our national secrets and tried to overthrow the government. He has told us he wants to turn the United States' two-party system into a one-party (GOP) regime, defund our freedoms, and exterminate his enemies. Even if you think it's all bluster, such an outcome seems bad enough that it isn't worth the risk just to make a point. I would also like more options, but until FPTP is replaced with ranked choice voting in most states (a move I 100% support), all third-party voting has done in recent years is allow increasingly shitty Republicans to get elected.

Growing up I've always heard that men have it harder because nobody will take of them, whereas men will almost always take care of woman (regardless of traits, employment, income).

Which I do mostly agree with, until looks are mentioned. Most men will not date, love, or take care of a woman they consider to be ugly. Being traditionally feminine, showing vulnerability, anxiousness, or being shy is are traits that are not afforded to me or other women who are considered 'ugly'.

In my personal experience, men have always treated me as if I were invisible or nothing. I have been called ugly, made fun of, and many guys have played me.

Furthermore, I've found that I've had to make up for where I lack in looks with bettering myself as a person. Raising my self esteem, not being sensitive/developing a thick skin, being more blunt, and being aloof. I also fully acknowledge that these changes will not guarantee that I will find love, as many of these traits don't matter to men at all.

18d19gr,CMV: Making fun of Incels is Cruel and Makes the Problem Worse,"I really shouldn't have to clarify some things before I get into it, because I think the ideas are all that should matter and I really am an armchair philosopher in this way where I think of society as a dinner party where we're just talking about things but I'm aware for many people it's not like that, and I also don't want to be accused of anything ridiculous. So, I'm not at all sympathetic with the ""incel"" cause or whatever that is. Many say very hateful things that should not be said, many act violently, etc. As far as I undertstand it, those that most fervently identify with the term, skew towards hatefulness.

My general impression is that they're, for lack of a better word, ""losers"" in a sense. The bottom of society etc. And because of that, I feel a great deal of pity for them. I think this sense of having ""lost"" and the judgment they feel is probably somewhere at the core of their hatefulness, and I think the media and people generally who use the phrase as a putdown, do ***absolutely nothing but aggravate the problem.***

If you're going to hold a view analogous to ""society's ills are systemic in nature"", which is a view that I hold, then making fun of someone for being an incel is the worst possible thing you could do. If your understanding of the problem is that people, almost always men, who can't get laid because they're almost always some combination of poor/ugly/weak/awkward/antisocial and we decide these things and decide that they're bad because of some combination of genetics/environment/evolution/society/blah (and I really don't mean that as an insult, more a statement of fact) that's a horrible thing to do! 

Instead, the problem should be viewed dispassionately, in one sense, and compassionately in another sense. But never, passionately hateful in retribution, which is how I see this group treated.

What would change my view on this? I suppose it could be argued that such an approach is necessary or utilitarian in some way, or that my view of it is just totally off.

18nnyyd,"CMV: ""Slippery slope"" is a perfectly valid argument to use.","Let me use drug addiction as an example.

Many ex-alcoholics refuse to touch a drop of alcohol again for the rest of their lives. There's a reason - even a single drink could push them on the path to relapse and then before they know it, they're a full-blown alcoholic again. In other words, they use a slippery-slope argument when telling friends and family why they must refuse any and all drinks, not even ""just a sip.""

Same with ex-smokers. Many ex-smokers cannot smoke again, not even just a single cigarette, because doing so could push them all the way towards total relapse again. Same with many illegal drugs, or an ex-gambler gambling even ""just one time."" They invoke the slippery-slope argument.

In business, politics, warfare or relationships (especially abusive or potentially-abusive relationships,) there are many times when one cannot yield an inch, lest the other person take a mile.

18lnxlf,CMV: Incels cannot influence movie box office numbers and cause flops in the way that is constantly claimed on social media,"I want to start by saying that I completely understand that incels exist, and that they can cause many issues for everyone; not just for the women they target, but also for men that get in their crosshairs.

One aspect where I am not believing that they have any meaningful influence as portrayed on social media: **movies and box office numbers**. Every time a movie comes out with a female lead and/or majority female cast, or a ""diversity casting"" as they constantly complain, if that movie flops, you have people screaming ""incels didn't watch the movie because they are scared of women, so of course it became a box office flop! But it's a great movie!"". If a movie is cast with a male lead and it flops, we usually do not hear the same rage from social media that ""<insert group name> did not like this movie because <reasons> and that's why it flopped"", as compared to when incels are brought up.

We have had some stellar box office numbers from female-led movies (e.g. Barbie, great film, loved it) and we've had some flops (from both male and female actors). Notable recent flop that made me want to bring this up: The Marvels. I saw the movie in the cinema when it first came out, really enjoyed it, but it was not a packed room on the opening weekend. Every time someone brings up ""incels are to blame!"" I usually answer ""why didn't women go to watch this movie since they want to support women in movies so much?"". Zero meaningful opposite responses, every time. The movie had decent Rotten Tomatoes scores, and was reviewed mostly positively elsewhere.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe that the number of incels that exist, that can influence movie box office numbers, is a statistically meaningful number. Not men in relationships (since incels are not in relationships), just incels that get constantly blamed for movies flopping. Even if incels complain on social media to try to ruin a movie by review-bombing it, it is pretty obvious when that happens; I have yet to see proof that review-bombing even works with these box office flops.",sinayion,608,446,0.8199999928474426,0.23143638332082792,1702944720,/r/changemyview/comments/18lnxlf/cmv_incels_cannot_influence_movie_box_office/,2023,12
18ffduw,CMV: Afrocentrism is a growing problem that needs to be publicly addressed in the school system,"Particularly African-Americans, I’m seeing this start to pop up all over my social media and real life. I understand where African-Americans come from when they say they weren’t taught about African history, empires, and world changing events, so they feel left behind when compared to how other societies and empires are taught in America; particularly Britain, Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and the Aztecs even, but this Afrocentrist idea of “they were all black before the modern people invaded and stole from our black ancestors” is becoming increasingly problematic social media issue and seeping over into real life. 

This all may seem out of the blue but as an Italian man, I’ve been seeing that “the original Italians were black” popping up across my feed, after seeing countless “the Greeks were black”, “the Egyptians were black”, “the Chinese were black”, “native Americans were black”. 

After getting into the classic instagram comment argument, the common argument is that, at least for European people and societies like the Greeks, Italians, and even the British; claiming that since Western Hunter Gatherers were darker skinned people than modern European populations, that these African-Americans can claim these people and societies as their own despite not being genetically, linguistically, culturally, historically related to them in anyway.

To sum it up. I think that this needs to be addressed either by better education on who these people, societies, and empires were and their modern descendants, and that sub-Saharan societies, people, and empires need to be better taught in the American educational system to combat against “claiming the next best thing as our own since we don’t know our own”. I was called racist by countless people for my argument about this but I do not believe that a people completely unrelated to my country and my culture can claim my country, my culture, and my history.",quinnbyal,436,699,0.6200000047683716,0.23025232123964912,1702247677,/r/changemyview/comments/18ffduw/cmv_afrocentrism_is_a_growing_problem_that_needs/,2023,12
18en3vb,"CMV: Leftists/progressives who won’t vote for Biden have no practical plan for avoiding, resisting or surviving a trump dictatorship.","The carnage and forced displacement in Gaza are horrific, and while I think Netanyahu and Hamas deserve most of the blame, I don’t approve of the U.S. supporting Israel while it’s doing this (even if Netanyahu might well take the same actions even without U.S. support).  At the very least, I support a temporary ceasefire in exchange for the remaining hostages, and making U.S. aid to Israel conditional on limiting civilian casualties (as some Senate Dems have recently suggested).    
So I understand anger from left-leaning people about this. What I don’t understand is a response that essentially threatens to throw Americans \*and\* all vulnerable populations overseas under the bus by allowing trump to be elected.    
All indications are that if he is, we’ll be dealing with someone determined to be a dictator, with a clear plan, and few to no guardrails.  The federal government is likely to be weaponized in every conceivable way against anyone who opposes trump.  Project 2025 provides a blueprint for purging the federal government of career employees and installing trumpist loyalists.  We’ve never seen anything like this in modern times.  They’re currently vetting 54,000 extremist loyalists for these jobs, using AI to do it.  This is certain not to end well for the country.  Trump’s flat-out said he’ll be a dictator “on day one”, and it’s been reported by multiple sources that he plans to use the Insurrection Act (which may not be reviewable by courts) to make the U.S. military his own private Gestapo—deploying them domestically to violently crush peaceful protesters, occupy blue cities, and persecute the media and political enemies.  Does anyone seriously think he’d have any compunction about seizing voting machines in the next midterm election to prevent Dems from winning (the way he tried to in 2020, but was talked out of it by people with more restraint, none of whom will be around next time)?  I know many previous elections have claimed, rightly or wrongly, that “democracy is on the line”—but in this case, a clear and detailed picture is showing us exactly how it obviously is.

Are left-leaning people ok with trump using the FBI and other alphabet agencies to lock up journalists and anyone who opposes him, on a scale never before seen here?  Do they care about what could happen to DACA recipients, LGBTQ people, or Palestinians here (whom he’s threatening to deport for their criticism of Israel)?  Do they think Congress (which is likely to be controlled by his lackeys if he wins), or a judicial system stacked with right-wing judges, will be willing to stop him—or even able to enforce its decisions if he ignores them, the way his role model Andrew Jackson did?  Do they think life will somehow just go on as it has been?  Do they think it’ll be no worse than last time, despite the lack of guardrails or any need to exercise restraint for the sake of reelection?  Do they see him promising to “root out” the “radical left vermin” and think, “Oh, it’s fine; he doesn’t mean me?”  In fascist regimes, leftists are often the first up against the wall.  Why do so many left-leaning people seem to be ignoring the clear historical parallels between this and fascist catastrophes of the past?  And why do they seem unconcerned about what would happen to Palestinians (or for that matter, Ukrainians) if trump is allowed to get power again?   
Whenever I bring up the danger of trump’s incipient fascism in debates with people who say they won’t vote for Biden, they seem to either wholly ignore it, or dismiss it with the facile, evidence-free claim that it’s just a “bogeyman” invented by Democrats (despite many of the sources being trump’s own words and his current and former employees.  Even trump’s former DHS chief of staff and former Defense Secretary, among many others, are warning about it).  Maybe this is just my experience, but I have yet to hear anyone who says they won’t vote for Biden offer any kind of practical plan for how to deal with the fascism that’s likely to result from letting trump win.  
Call me crazy, but I thought leftists and progressives opposed fascism.  So why do some seem so entirely blind to the danger of clearly rising fascism in this country?  Are they truly unaware of it?  Can they really not pay attention to more than one thing at once?  Is there no way, \*at all\*, to oppose current U.S. foreign policy, except by selling out all our rights and enabling a fascist with an even worse foreign policy?  And if the outcomes are likely to be worse at home and abroad, how can enabling trump be helpful to either Palestinians or the anti-fascist cause?  
I’m not so much interested in arguing, here, about whether people should vote for Biden.  I’m also not interested in hearing overly simplistic, propaganda-laden declarations like, “Oh, I just can’t vote for genocide,”—nor in debating whether that’s even an honest term for what’s happening.  If you’re a left-leaning person who won’t vote for Biden, what I’m looking for is a detailed explanation of what your \*practical, concrete plan\* is for stopping or limiting the damage done by a trump dictatorship, along with the fact that SCOTUS would remain in right-wing hands for even longer into the foreseeable future, as a result of empowering him.  (In your response, remember that protests are likely to be crushed by the military, and future free elections are also in doubt).  How does allowing him to win provide anything resembling a viable path to a better future?  
And for those whose answer is “accelerationism”—meaning they want to encourage a brutal dictatorship and all the suffering it’d cause, because they think it’d spark an armed revolution—I’m looking for \*practical\* solutions, so miss me with that theory, unless you can show how it’d be a \*practical, viable and effective\* course to take—one that’d actually \*reduce\* suffering, compared to electing Biden.  If you can’t show that convincingly, you’re just ineffectually fantasizing as far as I’m concerned.  Same thing if you advocate voting third-party and expect sufficient numbers of people to somehow suddenly join you—unless you can show how that’s a \*practical\* plan to beat trump, it’s not a valid response to my question.  
So how about it?  Do anti-Biden leftists \*only\* oppose the current carnage in Gaza, and they’re fine with anything trump might do domestically, or overseas in the future?  Or do they also have a \*practical\* plan for stopping fascism that doesn’t involve electing Biden?  I’m genuinely curious.  When I’ve asked people this question previously, I occasionally get a verbal shrug, or dismissal without any backing, like I said—but I usually just hear crickets.

1. The government should not have this much control over its own citizens, to decide what the citizen consumes. We pay our taxes, and we are sovereign individuals with our own will. If a person decides that they want to destroy their health with drugs, then that’s their choice. And as long as that person isn’t committing crimes, then it isn’t the government’s business. And while you could argue that the government has banned drugs to preemptively reduce crime, you cannot hold people fully accountable for their choices while simultaneously steering them into one direction. 

2. Alcohol is one of the worst drugs to exist. It’s highly toxic, destructive and sometimes lethal. Withdrawal of alcohol can be lethal for some addicts, and it is highly addictive. To ban certain drugs, even those that are less dangerous than alcohol is illogical. And the only reason for alcohol even being legal, is because of cultural norms. Similarly, the only reason other drugs are illegal is also cultural.

18uib7l,CMV: The rate at which words evolve to be unacceptable in any context has been increasing and words should never have so much power over us that they are unacceptable regardless of context.,"I had a bit of a false start with this one for a multitude of reasons, the most significant of which were not censoring the language I used and combining two different topics that really ought not have been combined.

I chose not to censor the language partly because despite every other major subreddit that I'm aware of doing so, the mods here do not censor language, something that I view favorably. I also had used these words on this subreddit prior in a similar context (speaking about censorship) in a comment that was well-received. I truly was not expecting the initial reaction I received and I was not trying to offend anybody.

After a conversation with the mods, it would seem the best course of action is to separate my two topics of conversation entirely. I'm still choosing not to censor the language. If my language offends you or makes you uncomfortable, that is indicative of exactly what I am speaking about. I'm essentially asking you to ask yourself why exactly that would be the case and ultimately, the deltas available will revolve around you explaining to me why the emotional reaction you're experiencing is correct.

The last time I posted this, it turned into a bit of a shitshow immediately. While I'm not one to phone the internet police, the mods here are pretty anal about keeping their threads clean so please keep Rule 1 (top-level comments must challenge my view) and Rule 2 (don't be a dick) in mind in your responses.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qm68p/cmv_nigger_is_a_bad_word/) is a link to the previous thread. There are several replies of mine that can give you a decent idea of where my head's at and you can even bring quotes of mine from that thread in here to use in your replies if you like.

*

I have been alive to witness at least a bit of the evolution of the word faggot. When I was growing up, it was essentially used synonymously with asshole or douchebag. I remember vividly an interview Eminem gave about the Marshall Mathers LP (2000) when I was 13 in which he said ""When I say 'you faggots keep egging me on' I don't mean 'you gay people keep egging me on'"" and I remember thinking 'I can't believe he just had to explain that.'
 
Now faggot is just as derogatory as nigger and it would seem retard is fast approaching if not there already. There was also backlash against both [Lizzo and Beyonce (and Weird Al!)](https://slate.com/culture/2022/08/beyonce-renaissance-lizzo-spaz-ableist-slur-lyrics-history.html) in recent memory for using the word spaz.

Even this website has evolved. When I first arrived (2013), both faggot and retard were commonly used in various memes, and while I can't remember ever coming across nigger (worth noting that it may have been auto-removed by most subreddits since the site's inception though I can't know that) I do recall people casually throwing around nigga now and then. Now this subreddit itself is the only major subreddit I'm aware of that does not censor language and have all posts that contain any of these words removed automatically.
 
The N-word has been the N-word since I've been alive. I was not present to witness its evolution but I would have to imagine it went through something similar. I never questioned it because for me it had always been part of my established reality. But having now witnessed this evolution happen myself a couple times along with the threat of it continuing to happen more, it does give me cause to question if words evolving to have so much power over us that they're unacceptable in any context and being essentially forcibly removed from our vernacular is the correct direction. Something about it gives me '1984' vibes.",Aggressive-Carob6256,396,530,0.6800000071525574,0.19134738704221554,1703950826,/r/changemyview/comments/18uib7l/cmv_the_rate_at_which_words_evolve_to_be/,2023,12
18ro656,cmv: I think we as a society should be doing more to prevent young men from becoming incels,"I’m saying this as someone who pretty much was an incel from ages 16 to 21. I think society is failing young men in many ways that result in the growth of incel like ideologies and why there’s been a mainstream success of red pill influencers in the vein of Andrew Tate and his acolytes. I think there should be a level of empathy extended to incels. I’m a firm believer that just about everyone deserves a chance to change, and in the case of most incels, the worst they did was post some shitty things online

I feel this way because my experience as an incel taught me that what I wanted wasn’t sex. Sex was just a symbol. What I actually wanted and what actually tormented me was that I didn’t feel like the type of person who could have sex.
I didn’t feel important to anyone, I didn’t feel desired, I didn’t feel attractive, I didn’t feel like I would escape how I felt as a loser teenager.

I was never affirmed. I was never told I look handsome except occasionally by my grandmother. I never got any attention from women my own age and as a result, I felt hopeless and ugly. 

I think that this is becoming more of an issue as dating and romantic/sexual interactions and dynamics take new shape. Women have the majority of the power in it now and men weren’t taught to adjust. I grew up thinking id have a normal dating life but as the hands shifted and women’s standards in what they want in a man physically and emotionally became out of my ability it broke me. 

I’m not saying women need to lower their standards. It’s human nature of women to pick from the top and not really acknowledge the scraps. But I do think boys need to be better equipped to deal with things and given the emotional support men haven’t gotten.",Similar_Charity9248,231,755,0.699999988079071,0.1872099047901112,1703640610,/r/changemyview/comments/18ro656/cmv_i_think_we_as_a_society_should_be_doing_more/,2023,12
18kajht,CMV: Blaming Bad Policy On 'White Men' Is Wrong And Politically Stupid,"I've been mulling over a topic [after reading it here](https://www.nationalmemo.com/ken-paxton-2666596245) and I think deserves our attention: the counterproductive and politically naive trend of blaming complex societal issues solely on 'white men'. This isn't just about being politically correct; it's about understanding the deeper, nuanced factors that contribute to policy decisions and societal changes.  
  
Consider this: Blaming 'white men' as a homogenous group for the challenges in reproductive rights or other social issues oversimplifies the problem and alienates potential allies. It's essential to remember that characteristics like gender, race, and age aren't opinions or ideologies. Yet, we often see this generalization, especially in certain left-leaning circles and media. For instance, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski repeatedly criticized Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, focusing on his race and age rather than his actions or policies.  
  
Let's take a step back and think about this. When we reduce individuals to just their physical attributes, we miss out on engaging in more meaningful, policy-focused discussions. It's easy to forget that people of all backgrounds can hold a variety of views. Texas Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar, for example, votes against abortion rights. Would it be fair or accurate to reduce his stance to his ethnicity? Certainly not.  
  
This trend isn't just unhelpful; it's politically harmful. By alienating groups, we risk pushing them towards opposing political agendas that may not align with their interests. Remember, the Supreme Court justices who established Roe v. Wade were predominantly white men. It’s about perspectives and policies, not just physical attributes.  
  
Moreover, this kind of rhetoric can be easily weaponized by political opponents. When we engage in this oversimplification, we inadvertently provide ammunition for figures like Donald Trump to rally against us, further polarizing the political landscape.  
  
So, what should we do? It's crucial to focus on policies, actions, and ideologies rather than resorting to broad, unhelpful stereotypes. Complex issues demand complex discussions, not reductive blame games.  
  
What are your thoughts on this? Have you noticed this trend, and how do you think we can shift the conversation to be more inclusive and productive?  
  
Looking forward to your insights and discussions!

18o0ha9,"CMV: Censoring a non-crude word pertaining to a difficult subject, like 'rape', is ridiculous and a category error.","I very recently saw an infographic about abortion laws in Europe by country, describing the permissibility of abortion and in which circumstances. It was a broadly informative or at least serious and non-frivolous infographic. And yet the word 'rape' was censored to 'r\*pe' in the legend -- in the context of 'abortions allowed in case of rape'.  
  
This is very far from the first time I've seen this sort of thing; in fact, it seems to be everywhere these days, and I'm mystified by it. What is going on with the censoring of normal words that pertain to difficult subjects? And how has it gotten to the point that in informational charts that's seen as an acceptable thing to do?  
  
I understand censoring words deemed to be crude or offensive, like 'fuck'. I understand as well that if I were writing a blog post and I thought my audience might be triggered by difficult concepts, I might give a trigger warning that rape will be discussed.  
  
I don't understand in the least who is being served by censoring the word itself. The word 'rape' is not a bad word. Rape, of course, is abominable. But the word 'rape' is not -- i.e, it's not impolite or crude to say the word.  
  
I see this all over the place now, but only very selectively applied. You never see 'murder' censored to 'm\*rder' or something, though I'm sure we all agree murder is abominable as well.  
  
And if the idea is indeed to censor the word so as to avoid someone being 'triggered' by it in some way -- well, censoring one letter of it won't achieve that at all, will it?  
  
There seems to be a category error going on, in which people are **censoring** the normal and accurate word in lieu of **censuring** a very terrible act. But that's completely bonkers, in addition to being infantilizing!

There's a real danger to the idea that one ought to censor a word pertaining to a difficult topic, instead of censoring crude words meant to degrade or be offensive. 'Rape' is not a word meant to degrade or be offensive (though of course the act is infinitely offensive -- obviously no argument there); instead, the word is a normal, accurate descriptor used up to and including in legal terminology to describe a heinous act. Censoring such a word is madness, not least because if it becomes the norm to do so, one might well be censured themselves for using the word uncensored. What irony.  
  
So, perhaps I've missed something. If so, CMV, Reddit. ",Ad_Captandum_Vulgus,596,138,0.9100000262260437,0.17613994544884773,1703201152,/r/changemyview/comments/18o0ha9/cmv_censoring_a_noncrude_word_pertaining_to_a/,2023,12
18t5hpd,CMV: Homeschooling should be way more heavily regulated if not outright illegal,"Homeschooling can sound like a good option to some people. Parents know their kids best, and can give their child all the attention they need and not be split among a whole class like a teacher is. That’s the idea at least. But in reality, that is not what happens most of the time. 

In most cases homeschooling is just a way for parents to have complete control over their kids lives and abuse them more easily or indoctrinate them into their own religious/political beliefs. We’ve all heard the horror stories of kids being unschooled and unable to even spell their name even as a 10 or 11 year old. Obviously cases this bad are not common, but the very fact that this is allowed to happen in the system AT ALL is a sign that it needs to be reformed. [Of parents who homeschool 75% say they do so to provide moral instruction. 59% do it to provide religious instruction.](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/tgk/homeschooled-children). Now you can criticize public schooling, but it certainly doesn’t fail to provide a moral backbone to kids or equip them to think critically about their own moral views and expose them to many different ideas. This makes me believe that these parents aren’t dissatisfied with public schools because of good faith criticisms of its curriculum, but because they don’t teach their own religious or political views as fact. Kids are not the property of their parents, they have a right to a good education, not an indoctrination into their parents’ ideas. Homeschooling often does not provide the wide variety of people and worldviews that defines public schooling and creates kids who cannot think for themselves as adults. 

Homeschooling also often fails to provide kids adequate social connections to other children. This is important not just for their own personal growth, but for them to learn what a “normal” childhood is like. It’s a lot easier to believe that parental abuse is normal if you don’t meet many kids who don’t experience it. It’s another form of control given to parents who usually are not trustworthy.  [Parents who engage in child neglect or educational mistreatment are more likely to use homeschooling as a guise.](https://digitalcommons.cwu.edu/source/2013/oralpresentations/137/). 

I am aware that academically homeschool kids tend to do a little better on standardized tests. But this only makes me more concerned, as based on the other data  it seems like parents are teaching for the test and not the actual skills the test is trying to measure. The point of social studies classes is not to know in what year Columbus crossed the ocean, but rather how to think critically about history, parse through information and different sources, and synthesize information to come to their own conclusions. Public school doesn’t do this perfectly, but it is at the very least the goal, unlike homeschooling for many people.

On the other hand, there are a significant minority of homeschooled kids who are due to having special needs, or from having suffered some negative experience at school that makes them feel unsafe. I do think this is a legitimate reason to homeschool, but I’d still like to see these types of kids returned to public school once the system has found better means to teach these kids and prevent abuses.

Ultimately I think this comes back to control. I think homeschooling gives parents way too much control over their kid’s life. Traditionally, kids were raised by and taught by the entire local community. We evolved to learn that way. Modern schools allow for kids to learn from a wide variety of people and curriculums are influenced by the entire community or nation. But homeschooling gives all that power to one or two people, who even at best are flawed human beings with blind spots. If you have a bad teacher at a public school it won’t be long before you’re in a different class with another teacher, and you have some mechanisms to remove that bad teacher. If your homeschool “teacher” is bad, there is almost nothing you can do and they teach every class. That’s just a bad system to put the future of humanity into.",LineOfInquiry,394,430,0.7099999785423279,0.17387992941338826,1703799916,/r/changemyview/comments/18t5hpd/cmv_homeschooling_should_be_way_more_heavily/,2023,12
18bgaur,CMV: I think the existence of God is unknowable.,"As the title says, I believe the existence of God is unknowable, which makes me an agnostic. I have been looking into the issue of the existence of God and I have noticed either 2 (or 3) types of proving that God exists and these are as follows:  
1.  Arguments for god's existence that end up being debunked/don't actually prove what they try to prove  
Take for the example the ontological argument, which states that God is the greatest thing we can imagine, i'd not be great for it to not exist, therefore it must exist, which can be refuted by simply replacing God with anything, like a floating island full of riches or a world where everyone lives in harmony, Just because i'd be better for X thing to exist, doesn't mean that it does exist. Or for example the cosmological argument (at least for Aquinas), which states that physical things exist now, which means that something non-physical had to bring them into existence and that something is God. But, this doesn't prove say the Christian God, that non-physical thing could just as easily be the universe, this argument just doesn't prove God.  


2. Arguments for god's existence that rely on unfalsifiable hypotheses (in the vein of say the Invisible Pink Unicorn, or the Flying Spaghetti monster or Russell's Teapot)  


An example of this would be the theological argument, or at least how some like to reply to counter-arguments to it, with this argument saying that nature looks designed, therefore it has to be designed and defenders of God usually say that is because of his omni-potent and he made the world in a way that aligns with his omni-benevolency. But why do rabbits have tails that hunters can shoot at them? Why do hurricanes, floods exist? Why do we have blind spots in our eyes and other bodily imperfections, among other things, while some say that this is because we got punished. But if he did indeed have his omni properties, we couldn't have done the first ever sin and why would a very good God create creatures that didn't share this goodness? Also, it is likely that the Adam and Eve story isn't even real and is just myth, Evolution, not creationism is the theory most grounded in scientific evidence. Although, a conclusion that can be drawn is that there is a God that is not within the bounds of space time, that does not care about us just because he is morally gray, he is everywhere and everything, or many other things that just make his existence an unfalsifiable hypothesis that just doesn't satisfy anyone, like heck it just makes the belief in him as legit as believing in the Flying Spaghetti monster.  


3. Oh faith cannot be argued for or against, you just have to look for it yourself (fideism, the Leap of Faith)  


Some, like Kierkegaard say that faith ain't something that should be grounded in reason, its like a Leap of Faith in Indiana Jones, there is a big deep gap between the two cliffs and he (Jones) can't jump over it, but there is possibility that there is one, a 50/50 one. Keep in mind though, this is possibility. Heck, there is a 50/50 possibility for anything, the probability may as well have been 1% for there to have been a tiny bridge and there may have been an even slimmer chance for him to have made onto it and heck is Indiana Jones really a good example? Heck, the course of his character is determined by a God technically, that being the film's creator, but whatever. The Leap of Faith exemplifies the absurd source for meaning in this cold, meaningless universe that will most definitely not succeed, as Camus said (yes, I do believe in absurdism). The fact is, even if faith is something that does not rely on reason as per fideism, it still doesn't solve the issue of God. If he is beyond our space-time realm, he is everywhere and everything etc., cannot be detectable, smellable, tracable, he doesn't care about us or his creation and whatever other properties we assign to him then there is to be no difference between a God and no God at all and even if we were truly under such God and not under just a universe and not some being, which we don't know then the absurd still exists but that's a whole other topic.  


Still, I am willing to have my view changed, whether it would be to fully dismiss God or to somehow bring me back to him, like basically the goal is to fill this hole of unfalsifiables and bring it, the truth to me so that I can have a clear position on this once again.
