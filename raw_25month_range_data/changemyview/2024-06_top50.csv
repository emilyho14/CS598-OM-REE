1dh7wsx,CMV: Asians and Whites should not have to score higher on the MCAT to get into medical school,"Here’s the problem:

White applicants matriculate with a mean MCAT score of 512.4. This means, on average, a White applicant to med school needs a 512.4 MCAT score to get accepted.

Asian applicants are even higher, with a mean matriculation score of 514.3. For reference, this is around a 90th percentile MCAT score.

On the other hand, Black applicants matriculate with a mean score of 505.7. This is around a 65th percentile MCAT score. Hispanics are at 506.4.

This is a problem directly relevant to patient care. If you doubt this, I can go into the association between MCAT and USMLE exams, as well as fail and dropout rates at diversity-focused schools (which may further contribute to the physician shortage).

Of course, there are many benefits of increasing physician diversity. However, I believe in a field where human lives are at stake, we should not trade potential expertise for racial diversity.",Excellent_Walrus3532,2432,1247,0.8100000023841858,0.8213917525773196,1718545524,/r/changemyview/comments/1dh7wsx/cmv_asians_and_whites_should_not_have_to_score/,2024,6
1dcajfe,"CMV: There is no reason to ever allow ""religious exemptions"" from anything. They shouldn't exist.","The premise here being that, if it's okay for one person to ignore a rule, then it should be okay for everyone regardless of their deeply held convictions about it. And if it's a rule that most people can't break, then simply having a strong spiritual opinion about it shouldn't mean the rule doesn't exist for you.

Examples: Either wearing a hat for a Driver's License is not okay, or it is. Either having a beard hinders your ability to do the job, or it doesn't. Either you can use a space for quiet reflection, or you can't. Either you can't wear a face covering, or you can. Either you can sign off on all wedding licenses, or you can't.

I can see the need for specific religious buildings where you must adhere to their standards privately or not be welcome. But like, for example, a restaurant has a dress code and if your religion says you can't dress like that, then your religion is telling you that you can't have that job. Don't get a job at a butcher if you can't touch meat, etc.


Changing my view: Any example of any reason that any rule should exist for everyone, except for those who have a religious objection to it. ",Dedli,2010,1413,0.7799999713897705,0.7774153893109061,1717985224,/r/changemyview/comments/1dcajfe/cmv_there_is_no_reason_to_ever_allow_religious/,2024,6
1di89d8,CMV: There is no moral justification for not voting Biden in the upcoming US elections if you believe Trump and Project 2025 will turn the US into a fascistic hellscape,"I've seen a lot of people on the left saying they won't vote for Biden because he supports genocide or for any number of other reasons. I don't think a lot of people are fond of Biden, including myself, but to believe Trump and Project 2025 will usher in fascism and not vote for the only candidate who has a chance at defeating him is mind blowing. 

It's not as though Trump will stand up for Palestinians. He tried to push through a Muslim ban, declared himself King of the Israeli people, and the organizations behind project 2025 are supportive of Israel. So it's a question of supporting genocide+ fascism or supporting genocide. From every moral standpoint I'm aware of, the moral choice is clear. 

To clarify, this only applies to the people who believe project 2025 will usher in a fascist era. But I'm open to changing my view on that too

1dek023,CMV: People shouldn't vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election because he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election,"Pretty simple opinion here. 

Donald Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. That's not just the Jan 6 riot, it's his efforts to submit fake electors, have legislatures overturn results, have Congress overturn results, have the VP refuse to read the ballots for certain states, and have Governors find fake votes. 

This was bad because the results weren't fraudulent. A House investigation, a Senate investigation, a DOJ investigation, various courts, etc all have examined this extensively and found the results weren't fraudulent.

So Trump effectively tried to overthrow the government. Biden was elected president and he wanted to take the power of the presidency away from Biden, and keep it himself. If he knew the results weren't fraudulent, and he did this, that would make him evil. If he genuinely the results were fraudulent, without any evidence supporting that, that would make him dangerously idiotic. Either way, he shouldn't be allowed to have power back because it is bad for a country to have either an evil or dangerously idiotic leader at the helm.

1dbv1el,CMV: The latest IDF raid to rescue four hostages debunks the “targeted operation” myth,"In the Gaza War, the IDF recently rescued four hostages. The operation was brutal, with Hamas fighters fighting to the death to prevent the hostages from being rescued, and civilians caught in the crossfire. Hundreds of civilians died and Israel was able to rescue four hostages. Assuming the 275 civilian death number is accurate, you get an average of 68.75 Palestinian civilians killed for every Israeli hostage recovered. 

This strongly debunks the myth of the so called “targeted operation war” that many on Reddit call for. Proponents say Israel should not bomb buildings that may contain or conceal terrorist infrastructure, instead launching targeted ground operations to kill Hamas terrorists and recover hostages. This latest raid shows why that just isn’t practical. Assuming the civilian death to hostage recovered ratio remains similar to this operation, over 17,000 Palestinian civilians would be killed in recovering hostages, let alone killing every Hamas fighter. 

Hamas is unabashed in their willingness to hide behind their civilians. No matter what strategy Israel uses in this war, civilians will continue to die. This operation is yet more evidence that the civilian deaths are the fault of Hamas, not Israel, and that a practical alternative strategy that does not involve civilian deaths is impractical.

1ds7o2a,CMV: we should stop using “people of color” when referring to anyone who isn’t “white”.,"I think that the term “person of color” is actually not just unnecessary, but also offensive.

And even though I’m white, it does make my skin crawl whenever I hear it because it’s basically one step away from the 1950’s, calling someone a “colored person”.

When people say “person of color”, they’re basically just saying that “person” by itself means white.

And I also think we should stop saying African-American (or even Asian-American) because they have been in this country for as long as white people have. If we continue saying those terms, we might as well call white people “European-American” and call actual Native Americans just “American”.

People don’t call Dutch or Belgians who have been here since 1870’s “Belgian-American” or “Dutch-American”. So why should we call black people who have been here since the 18th century “African-American” when they are just as American as the rest of us?

1d8511u,"CMV: Marrying someone who is straight, while you yourself are gay and hiding it, makes you a horrible person.","Over the years I've watched or heard, of stories involving gay partners coming out further along in life after marriage. 

If you know you are gay and you commit to a heterosexual relationship without conveying that information to your partner, you are a liar and a genuinely horrible person. Both to yourself and your partner.

I would like to clarify that in this post I am strictly speaking about people that know they are gay BEFORE they commit to marriage. If you find out your sexuality later on in life, that's unfortunate for the other person but not your fault.

The single most important factor in a healthy relationship is trust. Withholding something as significant as, ""not being attracted to your partner"" is the ultimate level of betrayel.

Being born into an anti-LGBTQ+ family is not an exception. You have a moral obligation to not marry someone who is hetero and distance yourself from your family. I know that sounds harsh but that's how I feel.

A really popular show that addressed this was, ""Grace and Frankie"". A Netflix series about two middle aged women finding out their husband's have been together for the majority of their marriages and the fallout afterwards. 

On twitter I saw that people really liked both the gay husband's but I just couldn't bring myself to. When I looked at them I felt anger and frustration that they would do something so backhanded and disrespectful to their partners. In the show they even said they, ""loved them"" but you don't lie to someone you love for 30+.

1dhbumr,"CMV: Small penis jokes deliberately emotionally hurt all people with small penises, not just their intended target.","Whether it’s “small dick energy” or “compensating for something” or “mushroom dick” or any other insult, I genuinely do not believe it is possible to make a small penis joke without deliberately targeting everyone with a small penis at once, even if the intended target is a misogynistic, bullying, egocentric jerk.

Simply put, these jokes imply that having a small penis is a very bad thing. That it automatically makes you a disgusting, sexist, egocentric loser. The people who make these jokes claim people with small penises must all be insecure, but then deliberately use this humour to cause that insecurity and alienate. It’s like hitting someone and then making fun of them for being in pain. They want you to be insecure and then use jokes to highlight that insecurity.

This concept must be foreign to a lot of people because it actually is possible to be a decent human being with a small penis, but these jokes imply otherwise and are designed to make people conflate small penises with being a vile, woman-hating, insecure, vain prick. Those who make them clearly do not care if they emotionally hurt normal people with small penises, and when we call out their body shaming, that’s when they say “See? You’re insecure! Lol you have small dick energy!” We aren’t defending the intended targets of these jokes, we are defending ourselves because we aren’t like the people they are targeting.

1df8pvv,CMV: Caitlin Clark is proof that a large source of what brings down women instead of building them up is other women,"Whether or not you agree with her playing style, or how good of a player she actually is, the truth is that she has done more for the building the wnba than any other person on this planet.  You would think that the other players are very appreciative and respectful for giving the women league record high sales, recognition, respect , etc.  But no, several players have specific targeted her, fouled her, badmouthed her, and even straight up assaulting her on the court when she has done nothing to provoke this expect just playing basketball and going through the motions.

Now, the same could be said about any new player entering a league including men like LeBron, however the common notion and argument I hear is that the only haters and people trying to bring Caitlin Clark down are the men, which is hard to believe given that nearly every big name in the nba has had nothing but positivity towards Caitlin Clark.  A big reason why the wnba exists is to provide an outlet that supports, recognizes, and accomplishments in women's basketball.

1dqa0ho,CMV: Democrats should hold an open convention (meaning Biden steps aside) and nominate one of their popular midwestern candidates,"Biden did a bad job tonight because he is too old. It's really that simple. I love the guy and voted for him in 2020 in both the primary and general and I will vote for him again if he is the nominee, but he should not be the nominee.

1ddowi7,CMV: The Hunter Biden Case Has Virtually No Bearing on Biden's Suitability as President,"After reading the New York Times' reporting, there seems to be a  consensus among reporters that this verdict will weigh heavily  against President Biden. I'm sincerely confused as to why that would be the case though because: 

1. Hunter Biden is not running for President.
2. Hunter Biden is a 50-something year-old man who presumably made his own choices. It's not like this was the case of a minor where the parents are ultimately responsible for his behavior. 
3. Hunter Biden does not write the President's policies, domestic or international. His conviction has no bearing on how President Biden will govern, set policy, make his budget, etc.  
4. President Biden has been convicted of nothing, charged with nothing. 
5. Donald Trump is literally a convicted felon. Shouldn't being a felon be worse for a campaign than being related to a felon?

Given those reasons, why is the Hunter Biden case even an issue? Most Americans are related or know someone personally that has a drug problem, and people who are in the midst of their drug issues are generally not known to be the best law-abiding citizens. The equivalency drawn between Hunter's court case and Trump's court caseS seems like a huge reach.

1d614o5,"CMV: People are treating mental disorders like they’re zodiac signs or personality tests. It’s dangerous and weird, but it’s the price we pay for lowering the stigma around mental illness.","I have ADD. I was diagnosed as a child and I’ve lived with it for most of my life. My mother has issues with anxiety, depression, and hoarding. My sisters struggle with the former two. None of us, however, *identify* with our illnesses to the extent that we turn it into a personality trait. We’re shaped by it but we are not *it*. This is where I think there’s a problem today. People are becoming tribal around the ideas of mental illness. Autism, ADHD, Bipolar, Anxiety, Tourettes, the more the concepts and language of academic psychology and psychiatry bleed into everyday life, the more people are going to construct their identities around it.

But I don’t think that’s healthy. I’m sure there will be plenty of people who respond to this who will say they’ve found community, connection and understanding through meeting/talking to others who share their illness. But when something as expansive yet also nebulous as mental illness is gets boiled down to 30 second tiktok video, we’re risking over expanding the definitions of illness so that they’re otherwise meaningless. Take a look at r/adhd for example. I’m a member of that group but I don’t frequent it often because the sheer amount of things people attribute to their ADD is ridiculous. People fail to understand the difference between correlation and causation and as a result we get posts like “I don’t like eating cake. DAE struggle with eating cake as an ADHDer??”

That’s a crude parody but it gets my point across. People are associating things to mental illness that are just normal human likes/dislikes. Yes, people don’t like doing laundry or brushing/flossing their teeth. Nobody, unless you love the sensation of floss on gum, enjoys doing chores. That’s why they’re called chores. If they were fun to do we’d call them “fun tasks”. But associating the dislike of chores as something inherent to ADHD is silly but when you take an idea like that, throw it into a lively internet community and combine it with the human desire to understand themselves or find a roadmap to building an identity you begin to the same “trait” adopted by others.

Most “neurodivergent” brains show no major differences from other humans brains. There are no “depression fingerprints” on the brain that allow people to identify a brain that has depression from a brain that doesn’t. The same principle applies to all other mental illnesses. It differs from person to person to person who are in turned shaped by their family, culture, and upbringing. But people want that roadmap so they’ll flatten that wide expanse into a flat binary of “ADHD” and “NON-ADHD”. Take the DSM for example, they tried to eliminate the diagnosis of aspergers and combine it with autism if I remember correctly but when people who’d identified as being “ASPIES” found out, they howled in protest at their erasure.

But, unfortunately, I don’t think there’s anyway to avoid this. The more we talk about something, the more we lower the barrier for entry. The more we lower the barrier, the more people can glom onto it for identity building. Kind of like the kids who, when I was a young, would fake cut marks on themselves to seem edgy and for personality fodder. But now we get it for every mental illness imaginable. To add a final point to this, I think the minute we start making other people’s symptoms iron laws for our own personalities is the minute we begin to limit and create reasons for why we “can’t” do something. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

We constantly talk about how much trauma there is in the world, how easy it is to be traumatized, how sensitive we have to be to other people’s trauma and how trauma trauma trauma can be and now we have high schoolers and middle schoolers claiming they have PTSD at rates combat veterans don’t have. Maybe some of them do, but I don’t think kids in the United States have it harder or that their classmates are any crueler then their grandparents generation before them. Or even my generation now. So either people have a bunch of repressed trauma a la’ the satanic panic of the 80’s that they’re discovering or people are using it as a clay to sculpt a personality from.",nowlan101,1690,300,0.8600000143051147,0.4247702455236028,1717288429,/r/changemyview/comments/1d614o5/cmv_people_are_treating_mental_disorders_like/,2024,6
1ddwxdf,"CMV: The political and philosophical arguments put forward by the subreddit r/TwoXChromosomes are extremist, inflammatory hate speech","I want to open by saying I’m a leftist politically and have never been associated with any right-wing or alt-right movements like incel or meninism or anything like that. My view on gender is that men and women are different, but equal and that they should share positions of power equally. I think the model used by many European Green parties (having two leaders, one male, one female) should be adopted by countries in respect to heads of state and other important departments. 

Ok with that out of the way, on to my main point. If you look at that subreddit on any given day their will be posts celebrating concepts such as “decentralising” men from your life which is described as switching all your service providers (doctor, therapist, electrician) to women, prioritising female friends over male ones, abstaining from any sexual or romantic relationships with men, only hiring women if you are in a position to do so etc. 

Can someone please explain how this is not just the white supremacy of gender theory? They’re using all the same talking points and philosophy that straight up fascists use? 

They regularly advocate for what is essentially a gendered apartheid system and will say that males and male characteristics need to be continually devalued and diminished in society. 

I have never heard any of these ideas said in real life, only on that subreddit which leads me to believe it is a fringe ideology on the edge of acceptable thought and should really be looked at more critically. If you speak to people in real life about gender, the overwhelming majority will agree that cooperation and mutual understanding between genders is essential for society and that increased respect between the genders can only be good for society, and this is the view we should be promoting… surely?!

Also the subreddit operates as a massive echo chamber which is don’t think is healthy, I was banned for trying to discuss the intersectionality of class and gender as from the perspective of a working-class man it seems like a lot of their views come from a position of privilege and do not reflect the realities of working-class relationships, social norms and family dynamics.

1drtg6g,CMV: The worst thing the DNC can do right now is nothing.,"The way I see it, there’s three scenarios, but only two are likely.

The first is what I consider the most likely, it’s the thought that inspired this post, and is by far the worst outcome for the DNC. They wait NC (get it?). Biden’s polling numbers don’t recover enough, and, as November approaches, they realize he isn’t going to win, panic, get Biden to step down, and announce a replacement. With a few weeks or a month or two to campaign, they aren’t able to shake Harris’ deep unpopularity and lose. Or,l they go with a different candidate, don’t get their name out enough because they’re short on time, and they lose.

The second is that they do nothing. It’s the second of the two scenarios that inspired this post. They pretend it didn’t happen, continue as before, and run Biden against Trump in a 2020 rematch. Biden, who wasn’t certain to beat Trump before, at the height of his unpopularity, runs amid his low rating, doubts about his mental ability, calls to step down from his own party, and (at least the perception of) a shaky economy and high prices. He loses.

The third, and the least likely, is the winning scenario. The DNC acts now gets Biden to step down, replaces him with a younger, more virile candidate, and all of trump’s doubtful supporters flock to the younger alternative. With the benefit of three months of vigorous campaigning, they take the win.

There is technically a fourth scenario. The fallout from the debate is minimal, Biden runs normally and defeats Trump. If this was likely, we wouldn’t be hearing calls for him to step aside from his own party and from major media outlets.",Separate_Draft4887,484,1129,0.6600000262260437,0.3904859603906674,1719721951,/r/changemyview/comments/1drtg6g/cmv_the_worst_thing_the_dnc_can_do_right_now_is/,2024,6
1djs0n8,CMV: Just Stop Oil is a strong net negative for the climate action movement,"A few minutes ago, I saw a video of Just Stop Oil painting Stonehenge with some sort of orange paint. This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it keeps escalating.

I believe that their organization is a significant net negative for the climate cause. They are so counterproductive that it seems like they must be paid actors installed by the oil industry.

I personally support climate action. However, many people around me, especially the older ones, are quite undecided. Every time Just Stop Oil commits an act of vandalism, they become more opposed to the cause because they dislike the activists advocating for it.

I also believe that gatherings and demonstrations are a great way to show discontent to the government. However, I would feel really uncomfortable attending a climate march with groups like Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion, as they escalate the protests and create conflicts with the police. I once experienced this firsthand and felt quite uncomfortable. As a result, I am less likely to participate again. I am sure many others feel the same way.

In my opinion, they also greatly harm the climate movement by pushing other causes under the guise of climate action.

I am also aware of a sexuality being a spectrum, strictly bi/hetero/homosexual isn't very common here and sexuality of everyone should be respected, always.

But the peoblem is the term ""bisexual lesbian"" sounds quite mutually exclusive, lesbians aren't attracted to men, and it can invite creeps, perverts, MGTOW-ers, redpills and incels thinking they can get any woman and girl they want, regardless of of the women's sexuality and their boundaries. Plus, it just confuses the hell out of LGBTQA+ and makes non-LGBTQA+ think the group is chaotic and senseless, the ""lesbian"" part of bisexual is already there, it means you're attracted to two genders  (pansexual is about more genders AFAIK, correct me if I'm qrong please). The term is quite an oxymoron, as if saying you can be a cat and a dog at the same time. As much as I'm trying to make sense of it, I just can't ignore the logical fallacy here.

Personal story for context: Years ago, a family member came out as gay to me and even brought a friend for support to tell me the news. I had never given any indication I cared about this information.

My response was ""Why are you telling me? If you brought home anyone for Thanksgiving and introduced them as your partner, I'd be happy for you. Why are you telling me?""

They didn't know. It wasn't an issue and we are close to this day. But it was a confusing situation.

I understand that the criticism will be ""You're straight so you don't get it."" But the reality is that we all just started dating one day and figuring out what we like.

It is an occasionally popular position in the Democratic Party to advocate for a ban on these rifles.

There are two problems with this. 1: The term “assault weapon” is so poorly defined it doesn’t ban weapons with virtually identical capabilities to AR-15s and Kalashnikovs, so it’s trivially easy to circumvent. 2: It is a proven fact that rifles are used in only a tiny portion of violent crime, as a matter of fact bare hands are a more common murder weapon than rifles, as are clubs or knives.

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls

So this proposal does not make logical sense. So-called “assault weapons” are not uniquely dangerous, they are not used in a large amount of crime, and the entire category is cosmetically defined.

I anticipate the primary argument in favor of an “assault weapons ban” to be to prevent mass shooting. This is a foolish strategy for preventing mass shootings as a person who is deranged can use almost any modern firearm to similarly deadly effect in the context of a mass shooting.

I think she’s being incredibly selfish and privileged. There are lots of parents out there, and if all of them followed her example, parking lots would become *much* more chaotic and dangerous places for cars and pedestrians alike.

Here are my very simple instructions for her: Put your kids in their car seats (or lock them in the car if they aren’t in car seats), pump the A/C if it’s too hot, and then take the 15-20 seconds to return the cart. There will always be edge cases like emergencies, people with special needs and not feeling safe if it’s an isolated parking lot, but to not return a cart as a matter of course is just wrong. If you do just a few seconds of planning it’s not that hard. I know because I do it nearly every day, by myself with two crazy kids in tow. I’ve never even considered not returning the cart unless I truly couldn’t, and then I’ll make sure it’s on a curb or something so it doesn’t roll away.

1d6iy5e,CMV: The only requirement to celebrating pride is being a proud LGBTQ+ person or a straight ally with no other political stances unrelated to lgbtq rights being necessary.,"It's pride month. I am a gay man. I'll see posts and such from friends along the lines of ""You can't celebrate pride if you're not against Israel in their conflict with Gaza. You can't celebrate pride if you don't believe in BLM.""

I personally believe both those things. But I think it's dumb to gatekeep pride with sentiments like that. That you're not allowed to celebrate pride if you're not in lockstep with other political causes. I think that logic is wrong. Here is my reasoning. 

1. You can say it's about ""gay people's protest against oppressor so that means you must be against other forms of people protesting against their oppressors"". But there's plenty of examples of people rising up against their ""oppressors"" that I'm sure most western progressive thinking people wouldn't agree with at all. It's not about standing up against oppressors in general. It's specifically and exclusively about LGBTQ+ people standing up to their oppressors, gaining rights, and creating better lives for themselves, and celebrating how far we've come.
2. I believe it holds up an oppressed minority group up to a higher standard. Simply because a person is gay that means inherently that have more of a responsibility to be support of all other causes of inequality? That's dumb. They should be against other forms of inequality because they're a human being, like anyone else should, that has nothing to do with their sexuality of gender identity. I get you can say it's hypocritical, but that's such a naive way of thinking of it. In a perfect world yes hypocrites wouldn't exist. But anyone of any demographic, oppressed or otherwise, has just as much likelihood to be a bigoted asshole. Telling an lgbtq person they're supposed to have some sort of inherently quality because they are lgbtq is exactly the type of stuff we're fighting against. 

I'm open to having my opinion changed, but frankly it's pretty inconsequential for me because I agree with most of the causes I've seen it being compared to and needing to support. The only one I saw that I was a little iffy on was being against fatphobia. I don't make fun of overweight people, in fact I'm attracted to bearish men, and I think it's great plus size people are getting more media exposure. But I see some probably rage baity things online about what fatphobia is that makes me roll my eyes so idk maybe I am fatphobic?

1d7kvdq,"CMV: ""Love the sinner, hate the sin"" is condescending and offensive.","Typically said by Christians to LGBTQ+ people. I think this and other similar sentiments while well meaning are incredibly condescending and queer people are right to be offended by it despite whatever good intentions might lay behind it.

  
I thankfully have never had someone say this to me in real life, my family and friends are very accepting but I hear about this from other queer people a lot and recently I have encountered a lot of YouTube content from Christians expressing basically this idea. What bothers me most is that the speakers in those videos and the commenters either don't realize or won't acknowledge why this would come off as condescending or why LGBTQ+ people would be offended by this.

  
Often this comes along with comparing being gay/queer to being an alcoholic or something like this. They make this comparison to emphasize that you can love someone while condemning their ""life style."" But ultimately this comparison only highlights how offensive this sentiment is. Everyone, even alcoholics, agrees that alcoholism is bad. People who are alcoholics will justify themselves by claiming not to be alcoholics (i.e. ""I can quit anytime I want""). On the other hand gay people don't see what they're doing as bad or unhealthy the way alcoholism is. I think this is why it comes off as condescending, because it assumes that we cannot discern  what is good for ourselves. ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" is condescending because it assumes queer people are ""sinning"" without even knowing it, like we're idiots but you love us anyways or something.

  
I think this is deeply offensive and feel free to call me ""triggered"" or whatever. This is offensive because most of us have struggled to get to a place where we can be happy and healthy. So many of us have tried to force ourselves to be straight/cis only to live miserable and unhealthy lives because of it.

1dmusxt,CMV: Falling birthrates are actually the best news we've seen in decades.,"The world, simply put, does not need more humans. We should be trying to improve life for the people who are already here, and to minimize our negative ecological effects. 

Right now, there is so much human life, in fact, that our society gives it no value; it allows children born in Africa—who might have the talents of Shakespeare or Einstein, but we'll never know—to die of preventable diseases because, contrary to this ruling-class gaslighting narrative of a ""labor shortage"", there is a global labor *overage*, which is why conditions for ordinary people are so atrocious. If we weren't grossly overpopulated, capital would have so little power, relative to labor, that we wouldn't even need a ""revolution"" against capitalism, because jobs would be competing for workers rather than the reverse.

At the same time, we exist under an economic system and at a primitive-enough technological level (still reliant on fossil fuels, for example) that we damage the planet irreparably for every year we exist in this state. If the birthrate drops precipitously and the population declines, we slow down capitalism's damage, giving us a chance of still having some semblance of a livable planet when we move beyond it.

The fertility collapse of educated people is one of workers using the one vote they have to speak out on the system, the prospects it has given then, and the opportunities their children would have if they existed. This movement toward voluntary childlessness isn't some epidemic of antisocial behavior; it is an outbreak of rationality and compassion. If we keep populating, we persist in a state of congestion wherein human life is assigned such a low value, our societies become terrible places to live. If we stop, on the other hand, we give the species a fighting chance. Voluntary depopulation might also be the only nonviolent way to overthrow capitalism and set us up to create something better when it finally collapses.

Don't get me wrong. Some of the reasons why birthrates are dropping are horrendous. Korean work culture and European stagnation and American inopportunity are not good things. Social isolation and involuntary celibacy (which, I suspect, afflicts many women as much as men) are signs of severe rot in our culture, and we should try to fix those problems. Not all contributors to the declining birthrates are good; some of these are serious issues that deserve address. Still, the fact itself of a negative net birth rate is something that all of us should be celebrating.",michaelochurch,675,514,0.6499999761581421,0.2712488978567553,1719172825,/r/changemyview/comments/1dmusxt/cmv_falling_birthrates_are_actually_the_best_news/,2024,6

1dp2whk,CMV: It is more likely that Trump is a criminal than that he is being persecuted,"Trump has been convicted on 34 counts and has several state and federal charges pending. This is after literal decades of accusations of criminal activity in his real estate and casino dealings. Trump himself claims he is being persecuted by political opponents:

>When you look at what's happening, this is a persecution of a political opponent. This was never supposed to happen in America. This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot. So if you can't beat him, you persecute him or you prosecute him.

Trump has a long history of skirting laws and shady behavior. This leads me to believe the current charges have merit, and are not persecution or anything like it. In particular, the documents case seems to be a clear violation of Federal Law.   
  
He famously evaded the draft based on doctors' assessment that he had bone spurs. [This doctor was a podiatrist who rented space from Trump's father. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-vietnam-draft-exemption.html)It has been pointed out that this ailment doesn't seem to have had any effect on Trump's golfing.

In the aggregate, Trump has a lot of close connections to illegal behavior. I expect one argument to be that working with organized crime is just something one has to do as a real estate developer in New York, [but none of the largest developers in New York City ](https://www.nyrealestatetrend.com/new-yorks-top-successful-real-estate-developers/)have had any of these allegations leveled against them. 

This CMV is solely regarding Trump, and whether he is likely to have performed actions that warrant criminal investigation. I don't want to hear about the other guy. 

Things that might change my mind: Compelling evidence that the charges do not merit investigation. Evidence that other prominent New Yorkers were charged with numerous crimes when they were not actively testing the boundaries of the law. Maybe something else that I have not thought of.

- Both sides suck;

- All politicians are crooks and cannot be trusted / I hate all politicians;

- The whole system is broken and needs to go;

- Etc. 

However, I've yet to come across someone who says this and votes liberal / Dem. It's ALWAYS people who vote GOP / conservative saying this. After all, if it were actually true, you'd see more of a 50/50 split among people who say this and the way they actually vote. 

A careful distinction is the word ""equally"" - the premise held by utterers of this phrase is that both sides are THE SAME level of bad; that they're six of one / half dozen of the other. In other words, this would not account for someone saying something like ""yes, the Democrats are far from perfect and have their issues, but their awfulness does not begin to approach the awfulness of the GOP."" In that way, someone is saying ""both parties have their flaws, but they are not *EQUALLY* bad."" 

My theory is this line of reasoning is merely refuge-seeking for the minority of well-adjusted people who recognize that Trump is a uniquely horrible human being, and that many GOP policy positions are reactionary and retrograde, but for whatever reason (the way they were brought up, peer pressure, their financial position, etc.) nevertheless are looking for a way to rationalize and justify their decision to continue voting for Republicans. If you can convince yourself that the other side is ""equally bad"", then it causes less cognitive dissonance & shame & embarrassment when you ultimately pull the lever for the side that's demonstrably worse.

Stand your ground is essentially castle doctrine but just apply it everywhere. But it is that application of it everywhere that is the exact issue in my book. First off, in public, you don’t have anymore right to be there than the person you believe is attacking you, so you should not be able to be the one who decides if your life is in danger or not. Additionally, it is generally much easier to retreat in public than in your home. 

Another thing is that stand your ground can be easily abused. Someone can just shoot someone and tell the police that the person they shot did x or y. 

Now, if someone does retreat and then has no choice, or is unable to retreat, then yes, deadly force is fine but this is true in all 50 states and doesn’t need a stand your ground law.

It makes sense that you can defend your castle without needing to retreat, but the entire world was never your castle.

1doohdh,CMV: We should consider abolishing or at least neutering the TSA,"The TSA costs upwards of [$12 billion a year](https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/testimony/2023/03/29/fiscal-year-2024-presidents-budget-request-transportation-security). [In 2015](https://abcnews.go.com/US/exclusive-undercover-dhs-tests-find-widespread-security-failures/story?id=31434881), an internal investigation of the Transportation Security Administration revealed security failures at dozens of the nation’s busiest airports, where undercover investigators were able to smuggle mock explosives or banned weapons through checkpoints in 95 percent of trials.

And that definetly exists and is bad. But as Europeans, or at least Western Europeans (German here), we are much more subjected to American propaganda but refuse to acknowledge that. And while Russian propaganda is pretty easy to avoid, the American one is much harder to circumvent.

1d5rgjl,CMV: Conservatives shouldn't have a problem with Islam and Muslims in their party because they virtually share the same views.,"Ever since 9/11, Conservatives and Republicans in general have waged a constant campaign against both Islam and Muslims as a collective for being supportive of terrorism and every terrible thing in society and that their views are not compatible with society. But I find this ironic because much of their party platform and views are in line with their views.

Both believe in traditional gender roles, traditional marriage, anti-abortion, family values, entrepreneurship, a heavy emphasis on religion in life, and less liberalism. As a matter of fact, many Muslims voted for the Republican presidential candidate during the 2000 election resulting in his win. They voted for him by 70% by the way.

But after 9/11 happened, that support dwindled along with hawkish foreign and domestic policy such as the War in Iraq and Afghanistan affecting them and calling former President Obama as Muslim due to his middle name being Hussein. And there was little-to-no backlash from the party and its supporters. Probably because doing so would be considered woke and politically incorrect. This resulted in them voting Democrat in for the next 20 years in spite of such diametric views because of constant scapegoating from them.

If anything this is an example of why Republicans are the party of Identity Politics and Tribalism. They always like to blame the Left for grouping every single minority group in one box and not allowing them to think for themselves when they are the ones who made them think that way. The same can be said about their views on Blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, and non-Christians in general. Hence, they had no choice but to advocate on each others' behalf due to discrimination from the majority who happen to be White and Christian. Yet all of these groups share the exact same values as they do.

As for Muslims, I'll repeat what I said. It makes no sense why Conservatives and Republicans should demonize Muslims and Islam when they believe in the same thing as they do. In fact, with much of the policy we've seen recently by Republicans in terms of abortion bans, anti-wokeness in terms of promoting LGBTQ content in schools and traditional gender roles and values, they'd be a winner among them. But they only show apathy towards them because doing so would alienate their mostly dumb White Evangelical base, which they view as ""pandering"". And quite honestly, if they do alienate them by courting and promoting Islam and Muslims, it would be better because it'll show that they've been pandered to enough and their holding and privilege in their party is coming to an end. I would like to see that happening. This way I can have the last laugh because their negative reaction will only expose that their party does indeed promote Identity Politics and Tribalism. After all, as I mentioned before, the party is mostly White and Christian with a few token minorities here and there.

1droa6v,"CMV: Human life doesn't begin at conception, but it's ridiculous to say it doesn't start until birth","Firstly, I'm aware most abortions occur early in the pregnancy, and late-term abortions are exceedingly rare. This post isn't focused on the morality or legality of abortion, but rather on when human life does or doesn't begin.

I don't believe that a fetus a week after conception is a human being. I think it's not inaccurate to describe it as a clump of cells. I don't believe human life begins at conception. But I also don't believe human life begins at birth. I'll explain. 

I have a friend who was born 2 months premature. It was uncertain if he would survive, but thankfully he did. Now, if someone had killed him when he was a month old, all people, pro-choice and pro-life, would regard that as the taking of a human life. But why would it be different if he had not been born premature, and instead his mother had opted for an abortion at 8 months of pregnancy?

It seems to me that to say one of these is the taking of a human life and the other is not, you must believe that the process of birth has some magical effect of changing a clump of cells into a human being. To me, this seems like a belief based only on faith, similar to how a pro-life Christian might say human life begins at conception by appealing to Psalm 139:13.

To put it more succinctly - there is no single, definitive moment that a fetus/clump of cells/whatever becomes a human being. Rather, it is a gradual (typically) 9-month-long process transformation.

1divqit,"CMV: If you are not having sex with your husband/wife, you are breaking your commitment to them as much as they are if they decide to cheat","I feel like I’m constantly seeing posts on Reddit from women where they talk about their man cheating on them, but then they also add that prior to the affair, they were only having sex like 4 times a year, essentially having a totally dead bedroom. 

So to me, I’m like yeah…what did you expect? 

My view is that if I marry you or am in a relationship with you, and the relationship operates under the expectation of monogamy, if you aren’t fucking me and maintaining our sexual connection, you’re actually breaking your commitment to ME. If I am supposed to be monogamous to you, but you don’t want to have sex (and won’t consult with a professional to get to the root of the issue or at least TRY anything to be able to fulfill the sexual relationship), you’re essentially holding me sexually hostage because you won’t fuck me, but apparently no one else can. 

I am not trying to justify cheating at all. I just am baffled by people posting on relationship subreddits being like “I can’t believe he cheated when I was never having sex with him!” Because to me, as a young woman, it makes total sense to me. If my partner is not willing to fulfill me sexually within our committed relationship where monogamy is expected, he is failing me in the relationship. He is breaking his commitment before I ever could if I DID decide to cheat.

1dieie1,CMV: If a draft exists and women can vote; they need to register. ,"Recently, it has been spread that all U.S. males, age 18-26, are to be automatically registered for the draft. Truthfully, I never recalled exactly registering (maybe when I got my license), but do have a draft number. It seems completely inappropriate that the U.S. government could impose such a duty upon men exclusively. Women are able to vote as well as hold office. That means that women are able to vote towards representatives who are able to vote for declarations of wars and vote to enforce conscription. There is no reason that women should be exempt from this process, for at least not one that doesn’t remove women’s rights. If women, as a whole, should be considered unable to fulfill the duties required of a drafted person, then they should not be entrusted with the duty of voting and holding office. If you can enlist in the military, you can smoke  cigarette (reference to enlistment age being 18 and smoking age being 21). Similarly, if you can vote for us to go die in war, you can come die alongside us. 

It is clearly discrimination and arguably the most significant issue of discrimination between the sexes. 

Thus, my argument boils down to:

If women are able to vote and hold office, as men are able to vote and hold office, then women must be registered for the draft, as men are obligated to register for the draft.

1d90fx9,CMV: Arabs never criticize other Arab countries. However when it comes to Israel it's the polar opposite.,"First off I'm not posting this to shill an agenda in favor of anyone, I will try to be as apolitical as possible.

As someone who has a North African heritage. Most of my family members hold strong grudges against Israel. But I didn't see any signs of grievance or complaints when other Arab leaders/countries do some sorts of violations. And it's not just my family plenty of Arabs in the Arab world keep their mouth shut when it's another Arab but when it's Israel it's the complete opposite.

Just for context, here's a list of violations and mistreatment Arab countries have done:

\- Al-Assad regime killing his own civilians during the civil war and the casualty count trample the one seen in Gaza. The regime literally used chemical weapons against its own citizens.

\- The Saddam regime in 1). Invading Iran (with the help of the west) in a brutal war where some wild warfare practices were used. 2). Invading Kuwait. 3) Repressing his own citizens and especially Shi'ites and Kurds minorities (Yes I know that Iranians and Kurds in other countries protested Saddam) but the Sunni's in other Arab countries just kept silent.

\- Speaking of Kuwait? How many of you knew that there are actually people indigenous to Kuwait and the government refuse to grant citizenship to. [The bedoon of Kuwait as documented here](https://bit.ly/3yHhhbh). Why don't Arabs protest for their self-determination like they do for Palestinians?

\- The countless Human Rights violations in the Gulf countries starting from the Kafala system (that Qatar rightly abolished after plenty of FOREIGN complaints) to the numerous inequalities women face. I can go on forever here

\- The war in Yemen that caused the biggest massive humanitarian crisis and was instigated by both Saudi Arabia and Iran, again no massive protests was seen in the Arab world to reach a ceasefire.

It seems to me that the only consistent thing here is that when the aggressor is not Arab/Muslim the protests are massively launched, even though Arabs have violated themselves to an arguably greater degree.

Another thing noticed inside the Arab discourse is that the holocaust existence is taken with suspicion and never embraced, same with the Armenian Genocide. Compare this with the war in Gaza where in most mainstream discourse it is referred as an unfettered genocide in Gaza.

Tell me in one instance a sizeable group of Arabs disapproved another Arab country/leader for a particular violation. I'm not talking about government officials, I will change my view if this instance pertained considerable members from society.",holamifuturo,442,337,0.6600000262260437,0.17772738062940857,1717620454,/r/changemyview/comments/1d90fx9/cmv_arabs_never_criticize_other_arab_countries/,2024,6
