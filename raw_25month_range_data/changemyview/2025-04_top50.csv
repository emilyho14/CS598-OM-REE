1kb1fjd,CMV: A factor pushing young men to the right is the lack of left leaning media that appeals to traditional males and their interests.,"Put a simpler way it's very difficult to find a good podcast on topics like hunting, fishing, fixing cars, agriculture, ect that isn't hosted by people with a conservative bend. And even if you go in with intention of ignoring any political comments when you're listening to or watching someone for hours each week then their views will begin to influence you whether you realise it or not.

A friend recently showed me a few episodes of the John Oliver show and while I found it interesting I kept getting pulled out of it by long, drawn out monologues about how horny he is for horses, or how much he wants to sexually assault star wars actor Adam Driver, or even multiple jokes about how scary making phone calls is. Needless to say but for your typical tradie scared of phone ringing is not relatable humour.

I don't think people realise the gap in culture between inner city office workers and more rural trades people, even little jokes that pop up constantly in modern entertainment like ""if you're part of generation ... you'll never own a house"" or ""if you're under 30 you don't have to pay attention because our next piece is about home ownership"". Most of my mates are in their 20's and already own homes so even these types of comments create a sense of unrelatability. 

So in summary I believe what could be considered mainstream left leaning humour and entertainment doesn't appeal to a lot of young guys and that is why they are flooding to people like Joe Rogan and other more conservative entertainers, because at least they're talking about something the guys are interested in.",New-Perspective6209,3869,2491,0.8399999737739563,0.8380810905277876,1745967132,/r/changemyview/comments/1kb1fjd/cmv_a_factor_pushing_young_men_to_the_right_is/,2025,4
1jw3hht,CMV: Many Americans have no grasp on reality and it’s largely why we’re in this mess.,"I was talking to my boyfriend the other night about how Americans have become so soft. Now I’m not a conservative by a long shot, I’m very much on the left. But I was talking about how if the civil rights movement or the movement for women’s suffrage had happened today, those groups either wouldn’t have achieved their goals or it would have been *way more* difficult because people just seem so apathetic and uncaring.

This led me into saying that I really think a large majority of Americans have no real grasp on reality. Sure, if you’re in true poverty or are homeless in this country, that’s absolutely gonna suck and will be a horrible and traumatizing experience. However, most people who make an average salary are doing fine. Sure, you’ll probably need a roommate in more expensive areas and I do think that’s an issue, but still… even living with a roommate in an apartment is like… fine (at least to me).

Americans are so landlocked and separated away from any countries that experience *true and intense* hardships, that I really do believe we’ve come to the ideal that not being able to buy what you want all the time is the biggest hardship of all.

I think the amount of wealth that can be gained in this country really messes with people’s perception of what is normal. It’s normal to need a roommate, it’s normal to live in a smaller house, it’s normal to have to budget. But because we see people living extravagant lifestyles, we believe that somehow… through sheer force of will, we could also get there.

I also think it makes normal salaries that are fine amounts of money seem “small.” Like, I make 70k and I live in a large city in Missouri, but it’s really a mid sized city compared to others in the country. I live in a nice apartment building, can pay my rent and bills, and still buy and do things I want every once in a while. But somehow people have decided that 70-80k is still… not that much money?

I think Americans have been sold a lie that we can forgo social services in the name of being a country where you can *possibly, but probably not* make all the money you could ever dream of and more. If we had subsidized healthcare, parental leave, etc we probably wouldn’t feel the need to make over six figures, but people have decided that it’s more important to possibly be able to become a billionaire than to have services that would actually relieve stress and money issues.

Americans don’t want to admit that maybe they’ll be average for their whole lives and that is ruining us as a country.",MissHannahJ,5722,587,0.8999999761581421,0.6178241670012043,1744305936,/r/changemyview/comments/1jw3hht/cmv_many_americans_have_no_grasp_on_reality_and/,2025,4
1kbowjo,CMV: The MAGA hat is the modern equivalent of a Nazi-era swastika armband,"Now, to be clear, I'm not claiming that MAGA supporters are Nazis, or that the U.S. today is equivalent to 1930s Germany.  But I am arguing that the MAGA hat serves a similar *s*ocial function to the swastika armband during the Nazi rise to power.  Both are symbols worn in public to signal loyalty to a political movement grounded in nationalism, identity politics, and authoritarian leadership.

[Research shows that political symbols shape group identity and public perception](https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/8/6/50).  The swastika armband marked allegiance to an ideology that promoted ethnic superiority and rejected democratic norms.  The MAGA hat, while originally a campaign slogan, has become strongly associated with anti-immigrant sentiment, misinformation, and efforts to undermine democratic elections.  [FBI data shows that hate crimes rose significantly after Trump’s 2016 election. ](https://www.newsweek.com/hate-crimes-under-trump-surged-nearly-20-percent-says-fbi-report-1547870) Studies from [Pew ](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/07/18/americans-say-the-nations-political-debate-has-grown-more-toxic-and-heated-rhetoric-could-lead-to-violence/)and [SPLC ](https://www.splcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/yih_2020_final.pdf)(Southern Poverty Law Center) indicate that MAGA-drive aggressive language by politicians makes violence more likely, correlating with spikes in xenophobia and political violence.

While the MAGA hat doesn’t carry the same historical weight or scale of atrocity, it increasingly functions as a marker of political tribalism and fear for marginalized groups.  Like the armband, it defines an “us” and a “them.”

I’m open to counterarguments and clarification. Change my view.",ansyhrrian,4502,864,0.800000011920929,0.5668182457897013,1746040799,/r/changemyview/comments/1kbowjo/cmv_the_maga_hat_is_the_modern_equivalent_of_a/,2025,4
1jz4zpk,CMV: The culture war is functionally over and the conservatives won.,"I am the last person on earth who wants to believe this, and I feel utterly horrified and devastated, but I cannot convince myself that anything other than a massive shift towards conservative cultural views, extending to a significant extreme is in the cards across the anglosphere, and quite possibly beyond, and maybe lasting as long as our civlization persists.

Before last month, I wasn't sure, I thought that there could be a resurgence, a strong opposition at least, or failing that, balkanization into more progressive and more traditional societies.

Thing is, all of that hinged on one key premise: that this was completely ineffective on recruiting women, and that between the majority of women and minority of men still believing in institutuons and civil liberties recovery was possible. Then, I saw something, the sudden rise of Candace Owens in a celebrity gossip context. She now controls a lot of this narrative, and it's getting her views from women. SocialBlade indicates that about 10% of her 4 million subscribers therabouts came from the last month, and the pipeline is real. Her channel has shockingly recent content regarding a ""demonic agenda"" in popular music as well as moon landing conspiracy theories (to say nothing of the antisemitism and tradwifery I already knew was wrong with her). A lot of women may end up down the same pipeline as their male counterparts due to the front-end content, and it scares me.

Without as much opposition, I'm terrified of the next phase of our world. Even if genocide and hatred are averted, I fear in a few decades we'll have state-enforced religion, women banned outright from a lot of jobs, science supressed via destroying good research and data, a ban on styles of music marked 'satanic', and AI slop placating the populace and insisting it's how things ""should be"", and with algorithms feeding constant reinforcement, I don't see a path out of this state of affairs.

1jslh6d,CMV: Muslims are afforded a right to be bigoted in a way other groups aren’t.,"In my experience, Muslims in the West are given almost a carte blanche to be as hateful as they please, in a way that no other group is. For example, Charlottesville was universally condemned. Nobody was justifying the angry mob yelling that Jews will not replace us. On the other hand, when Muslim students organize riots on college campuses that are in support of a terrorist organization that is racist, sexist, antisemitic, and opposed to western values, people call it free speech.

A study was published recently that showed that people were more likely to be in favor of the deportation of a European student for harassing Jews than a Palestinian/Muslim student who engaged in the same behavior. 

It seems like society is so afraid of being called Islamophobic that Muslims end up getting a free pass for behavior that wouldn’t be acceptable from anyone else. People oppose homophobia, unless it’s the Muslim city council in Michigan passing a resolution to ban gay pride flags from public property.

The MeToo movement was very talked about and of course people stood against r*pists and sexual assault. Then October 7th happened and suddenly everyone was blaming Jewish women for being sexually assaulted by Muslims or accused the victims of lying for gain.

This plays out in very dangerous ways, too. People fall into a bigotry of low expectations with regards to rampant human rights abuses in Muslim countries. People storm the streets for women’s rights in the west, but are silent when it comes to middle eastern women being forbidden from the most basic rights, such as the right to even speak out loud or choose what to wear. 

For years, and especially since October 7th, people have said that Muslims/Palestinians have a “right” to be bigoted against Jews because of perceived grievances. Those same people would never excuse antisemitism from a white person.

1kas1qr,CMV: A growing percentage of single men is not something to be “solved” by trying to figure out how to get more men access to relationships with women.,"**Disclaimer: Apologies for the wall of text. I do kindly request that people not respond without reading the entire post if they can help it. Also the context of this view is from a western (mostly UK/US) perspective, and should not be applied to societies outside of this**

The so-called “epidemic” of single men is the natural progression of a society where women have the freedom and autonomy to opt out of relationships with men, and nothing can (or should) be “done” to reverse this. As women gain greater economic and professional independence many are increasingly choosing to forgo traditional romantic or sexual partnerships, inevitably leaving an increasing segment of men without the kind of access to relationships that once was readily available to a larger percentage of men.

In my opinion, because this is a natural result of women's increased self-sufficiency, this is not something that can be “solved” (as in reversed) without infringing upon women’s ability to choose what kind of lives they want to live & relationships they want to be in.

I’m not sure I believe popular narrative that a growing number of single men reflects some sudden decline in male quality—I think, rather, a climate in which women are able (and thus increasingly likely) to choose solitude over being in a relationship. No doubt there’s some overlap between men who can’t find partners and men who are disturbingly misogynistic, immature, socially awkward, have unrealistic expectations, bad hygiene etc—but I’m not sure that such men represent the majority of men who can’t find partners rather than an obnoxiously loud minority. Instead I think many despite their best efforts just can’t successfully compete with the appeal of solitude, independence and self-fulfillment that a growing number of women now have the ability to prioritize. **To be clear, I’m not saying men as individuals shouldn’t try to compete, or be given advice to increase their chances, but that the number of unsuccessful men will likely continue to increase regardless.**

This reality isn’t likely to change as long as we live in a society that protects women’s autonomy, and that’s a good thing. **Therefore we need to start thinking about how to help men cope with this new reality**, instead of trying to engineer ways to decrease the number of single men (and honestly all the non-authoritarian “solutions” I’ve seen that boil down to this, read as denial of the fact that women’s increased self-sufficiency results in more single men).

Society should instead look for ways to offer all men alternative frameworks for meaning, identity and connection that don’t hinge upon securing romantic/sexual access to women & their reproductive labor. This is what should be “done” about the growing number of men who will likely never marry/reproduce. Or rather, done to *support* the ones who need it.

This support could begin with dismantling the cultural narrative that defines manhood (in part) through milestones related to women such as securing a partner or becoming a father. It should also include increasing men’s access to other forms of connection & emotional fulfilment beyond romantic/sexual partnerships. But before that can happen, we need to dismantle the deeply ingrained narrative around men’s emotions—the idea that emotional expression is a weakness, intimacy is reserved for romantic relationships, and vulnerability makes a man less “manly.” As long as emotional depth is culturally coded as feminine or shameful, men will continue to struggle to build fulfilling & meaningful platonic bonds and seek emotional connection outside of romance.  

It should also involve dismantling social constructs that reward men for fitting into this narrow scope of masculinity. For example, husbands/fathers are more likely to receive promotions or raises, often justified by increased financial obligation, **but also rooted in perceptions of higher competence, capability, maturity and dependability compared to single/childfree men simply because they’re fathers (despite typically not even shouldering the brunt of child-rearing or emotional labor that relationships incur).** This is called the “Fatherhood Premium”. Meanwhile, women in similar positions face the opposite effect called the “Motherhood Penalty”, and don’t get the benefit of being perceived as more competent or capable just because they’re mothers, so this perk isn’t really about supporting families as much as it’s about rewarding men for being husbands/fathers.

**Even if salary increases for men with greater financial obligations due to parenthood is justified, the broader perception of husbands/fathers as inherently more competent, mature, capable or dependable than single/childfree men is problematic**. We need to build a culture where single and childfree men (people in general but this post is about men) are not seen as lacking and where their contributions, attributes and potential are just as valued.

One of the biggest obstacles to this progress is that men with access to these perks want to keep this access exclusive to men like them (like how the wealthy want to keep wealth among the wealthy).  Afterall, it’s usually men with wives & children who control the institutions that dole out these benefits to men like them. I don’t have the answer to how we dismantle this obstacle but I believe it’s worth those who care about the wellbeing of single men collectively taking a stab.

To keep this from getting any longer, this merely the tip of the iceberg. But these are ideas that don’t boil down to “figure out why the women don’t want the men and do something about it!” The goal shouldn’t be to force partnerships where they’re not wanted, it should be to build a society where men can thrive emotionally with or without them, the same way we’ve shifted towards a society where women increasingly thrive with or without them.",bobothecarniclown,605,1804,0.6899999976158142,0.4149697035858275,1745943716,/r/changemyview/comments/1kas1qr/cmv_a_growing_percentage_of_single_men_is_not/,2025,4
1jubiil,CMV: The 2024 Election could have been stolen and there is enough evidence to start state level investigations.,"Hello Redditors,

I’m fairly new to Reddit and social media (I know, super late to the game), so **forgive me if this post is too long or doesn’t obey some sort of Reddit norm that I don’t know about.** 

I was responding to a post in r/AdviceAnimals yesterday, and I found some of the reactions to my comment a bit odd. Based on the level of evidence I've read - I believe the 2024 election could have been stolen.

I was told that there’s *“no evidence”* that the 2024 election was stolen. That it’s all baseless. That it’s over, and that people questioning the results are anti-democratic. Pretty odd given the guy who occupies the White House still denies the last one. 

But here’s the thing: when you actually look at the data (unlike the last election where there really was no data to support any sort of fraud, and yes, I looked), public records, and even the statements made inside the White House after the election, a very different picture starts to form. I’m not saying this definitively proves the election was stolen, but if this isn’t at least worth investigating, then what is? 

I’ve tried to summarize the major facts so far as objectively as possible. Let me be very clear here: **I AM NOT A LIBERAL, BUT I DO DESPISE DONALD TRUMP AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY.**   
  
I consider myself a diehard centrist or even a radical independent. There are things I agree with Trump on, things I agree with Biden on, hell, I even agreed with SOME of RFK’s stuff on food additives and such. I really strive to look at every issue independently. Now, also to be clear, I despise Donald Trump because he is a low-quality human, he implements his ideas like a mobster in the 1970s and he's turned people into douches, BUT I’m trying not to let this bias impact my assessment. 

Let me lay out the evidence that at least warrants examinations of the cast vote records in all swing states and audit each of the ballot counting machines, including any software updates that could have been done before election day.

**1. Trump’s Own Statements**

On January 19, 2025, during a pre-inauguration rally in Washington, D.C., Donald Trump expressed gratitude towards Elon Musk for his support during the campaign, particularly in Pennsylvania. He stated: 

“He journeyed to Pennsylvania where he spent a month and a half campaigning for me… and he’s a popular guy. He knows those computers better than anybody. All those computers. Those vote-counting computers. And we ended up winning Pennsylvania like in a landslide.”  

Then during a FIFA World Cup announcement, Trump veered from soccer talk to politics when reflecting on how the United States secured hosting rights during his first administration. ""When we made this, it was made during my term, my first term, and it was so sad because I said, can you imagine, I'm not going to be President, and that's too bad,"" Trump said. ""And what happened is they rigged the election and I became President, so that was a good thing.""

Sure, Donald Trump is an idiot and says incoherent stuff all the time, but two incidents and one directly referencing the “vote-counting computers” do seem extremely fishy, especially given the work of the Election Truth Alliance or ETA.   
  
I’ve seen some Reddit posts criticizing these guys, but I’ve listened to the few videos they’ve produced, and they don’t have that same aura of bias that the election deniers from 2020 had. But again, this absolutely is circumstantial evidence at best – I think hearsay would be the appropriate classification, but these comments do and Trump's past statements about the 2020 election being rigged establish motive. 

**2. Clark County, NV**

Let’s move on to Nevada. The Election Truth Alliance analyzed the Cast Vote Records (CVR) from Clark County, raw voting machine data publicly available, and found multiple quantitative anomalies that demand answers.

*a. Drop-Off Voting Discrepancy:*

A “drop-off vote” is when someone votes for president but skips down-ballot races. This is normal, but here’s the twist:

• Trump had a +10.54% drop-off rate.

• Harris had just +1.07%.

That’s a 10X discrepancy. Why would Trump voters overwhelmingly skip Senate races but  
Harris voters didn’t? That’s not just odd, it’s statistically glaring and does not line up with past trends from other swing states. In fact, in Pennsylvania in 2024, the drop-off rate was around 5% for Republicans, and in 2012, during the Obama v. Romney campaign, the drop-off was 6% for republicans. In other words, **10% is wildly high.** 

*b. Early Voting Tabulator Anomalies:*

In early voting, the more ballots a tabulator processed, the more predictably skewed the results became:

• At tabulators with <250 ballots, Trump and Harris showed reasonable variance.

• **But above 250 ballots, results converged tightly around Trump 60%, Harris 40%, across the board.**

Human voting behavior doesn’t do that. You don’t get rigid clusters from tens of thousands of individual choices unless something artificial is influencing the result - perhaps a software update from some future DOGE employees? I don't know, but it certainly seems that Elon and his group of wunderkids have the means to do something like hack into counting machines or deploy a software update to them to manipulate them.

*c. Different Voting Methods = Different Realities:*

• Mail-in ballots: Trump got just 36%.

• Early voting machines: Trump got 59%.

• Election Day ballots: Trump at 50%.

How can such wild swings exist by the voting method alone? If you believe in clean elections, you have to ask, why would someone’s preference change that drastically based on how they vote? Again, circumstantial evidence here, but these do not line up with historical averages at all.

All this isn’t opinion. It’s right there in the official public CVR data. And we haven’t even gotten to Pennsylvania yet. Granted, it takes some time and will to really read through and understand this stuff – but my god, if something is worth your time, it’s making sure that who you vote for actually counts. If not, then it’s the entire ball game. 

**3. Pennsylvania**

Pennsylvania is where historical voting patterns were flipped on their head, and no one seems to be asking why.

Traditionally, urban centers like Philadelphia vote Democrat, and rural counties lean Republican, but in 2024, heavily Democrat precincts saw abnormally low turnout, while swing counties reported turnout higher than registered voter levels in some cases.

ETA flagged precincts where:

• Ballots cast exceeded 100% of registered voters.

• Votes for Trump outnumbered total ballots submitted, based on county reporting timelines.

• Tabulation errors were “corrected” days later with no audit trail.

Are these smoking guns? No. But they’re not normal either. And in any functioning democracy, these would be red flags triggering mandatory investigations, not media blackouts and certainly not blind ignorance or calling people who question the results, anti-democratic. 

Ask yourself this: if the exact same anomalies had helped Harris win, if he had unusually low drop-off rates, suspicious clustering in early voting machines, and skewed turnout in major cities, wouldn’t the media, Trump himself and half the country be screaming for investigations?

Wouldn’t Republicans be marching in the streets, demanding transparency? You know they would.

But somehow, when the data points in favour of their guy, suddenly, the response is, “Shut up, conspiracy theorist.” Unlike the 2020 election, there is a straightforward narrative you can paint, using data and logic, that is downright diabolical if it is true.

I strongly encourage folks to go have a look and read through the materials themselves. The one thing the Election Truth Alliance is doing is providing comprehensive documentation on their efforts, unlike many of the election deniers from 2020. 

And please, if you review this material and then say, “Hey, you’ve misinterpreted something,” – change my view, please, because this is truly exhausting.

No condition that he is or conditions in the prison could be worse than him being shipped off and literally murdered there. Even if beatings/rape/slavery were the case, he is still being held in a prison in his country of origin and they could make some kind of justification for his remaining there. Evidence of his being alive doesn't give US judges, senators, lawyers any more power to get him back but would allow the Trump admin to benefit by them saying ""see liberals - you're overreacting because he is alive.""

1k1od4a,CMV: Voting Republican today is a fundamentally inhumane act.,"Over the past several years, I've come to believe that the modern Republican party—and by extension, many who support it—actively vote against the wellbeing of vulnerable people. From policies on healthcare and education to the way marginalized communities are treated, I see a pattern of cruelty, apathy, and an unwillingness to engage with the broader impact of their votes.

This has led me to a cynical conclusion: Republican voters either don't care about others, lack the critical thinking to see the harm being done, or are simply echoing the beliefs of their social circles without deeper examination. I’ve struggled to see meaningful counterexamples, and I worry that “conservatism” today is less a philosophy and more a brand that people follow blindly.

I know this is a harsh stance—and I’m open to being challenged on it. If I’m wrong, I want to understand how. Are there values in today’s Republican voting base that prioritize humanity? Can voting Republican in today’s political climate still be morally defensible?

1k1ivtj,CMV: the American Left is too disorganized and decentralized to be of any use against MAGA,"There's an old saying about politics in America: when it comes to politicians, the Left has to fall in love, while the Right falls in line. It’s a huge generalization (the first of many I’ll make here), but there may be something to it.

The Left likes to mock MAGA for being idiots, but they have POTUS, 2/3 of SCOTUS, a congressional majority, and the world’s richest men who just so happen to control the most powerful media corporations. Who exactly is the party of idiots here?

This domination of government didn’t happen by chance; it’s the result of decades of careful planning by conservative organizations. The Right is excellent at branding; they come up with a bumper sticker slogan and they all stick to it relentlessly, regardless of how counterfactual it might be. Call them sheep, but they know how to organize.

The Left, on the other hand, is a circular firing squad ready to slaughter any of their own who don’t pass an ideological purity contest. (See the opposition for Biden/Harris on Gaza even when Trump made it abundantly clear he would bulldoze Gaza.). If the Right is a pack of wolves (or sheep) the Left is a pack of cats, utterly useless at organization.

The Left is great at theatrical protests, and terrible at actually getting anything done. Take the Tesla protests for example. Why would you film yourself throwing paint all over a Tesla dealership? You go to jail, possibly get slapped with domestic terrorism charges, and they wash the paint off the next day. It’s pure theater. 100% attack, 0% damage.

They could accomplish far more if they weren’t so focused on theatrical protests. Tere are only 160 Tesla stores in the US. It would be easy to find 160 individuals willing to sneak by in the dead of night with a squirt gun full of paint thinner and do far more damage without getting arrested, but that would require some degree of organization. \[\*NOTE: I'm absolutely 100% NOT advocating vandalism or any other criminal activity. I'm just pointing out that I’m an average schmuck with no activist credentials and it took me less than 30 seconds to come up with a solution that would be more economically devastating than what these feckless clickbait slacktivists have done.\*\]

Occupy Wall Street is another great example. It was very theatrical, and made for great TV, but what exactly did they stand for? What did they accomplish? There was no unified message, so it was too easy to divide and conquer, and the movement accomplished basically nothing.

The Right has been proactive and is very well organized. The Left is reactive and disorganized.

With Francisco's death, my social media feeds filled up with posts about Robert Sarah and how he's supposedly the annihilator of ""wokes"" or something like that... All those posts (and their comments) came from accounts clearly expressing hatred toward LGBTQ+ people.

1jsox9n,CMV: America has no way to remove Trump due to its ridiculously entrenched laws for the preservation of the presidency.,"All the protests, discontents, negative poll numbers, and even a majority republican dissent will NOT be able to remove Trump from office. 

They have tried to impeach Trump twice, and it did not work. 

If impeaching Trump for actual CRIMES did not work, then the constitution has NOTHING else to enable the removal of a US president. 

He would literally have to kill an innocent person on video to be successfully removed from office. 

Incompetence, greed, selfishness, gross negligence, ignorance, egomaniacal, general scumminess, ruining the economy and foreign relation, even actual fascism will NOT be enough to remove Trump, because American laws for removing the president is so weak that nothing sort of an actual horrible crime (murder, rape, treason) can lead to a successful prosecution and removal. 

A ""No confidence"" vote is not a thing for the American presidency. 

""But sir, surely actual fascism is enough to remove the President, right?"" -- I don't think so, because by then it would be too damn late and all the laws will be changed to keep him in power, Nazi style. 

It's relatively easy to vote someone into the presidency but ridiculously hard to remove them before their end of term. 

Trump could literally turn America upside down and inside out, dragging the world down with America and STILL remain in office. 

If any American constitutional/law/presidency experts could change my view on this, please enlighten me. I would LOVE to be proven wrong because this is becoming absolutely ridiculous.

I personally don't believe it's wrong other racist for them to prefer refugees and immigrants from Ukraine over Arabic and African ones f9r 3 reasons

1-Ukranians share similar cultures, values, politics, and religion with other Europeans countries unlike Arab and Africans so Ukranians integrate way easier in Europe than Arab and African ones due culture similarities.


2- Arab and African countries do the same thing to Ukranian refugees, not a single Arab or African nation took Ukranians as refugees, but many of these nations took other Arab and African refugees.


3-Companies prefer hiring immigrants from poor third world countries over hiring locals and immigrants from developed countries because of cheap labour which hurts the local population so it's natural for locals to oppose immigration from poor countries.

1k43r3m,CMV: Citizens United was the worst thing to happen to the American political landscape,"Ever since the Citizens United v. FEC decision in 2010, I’ve felt like the integrity of American democracy has been steadily deteriorating. The ruling essentially said that corporations and other outside entities can spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections, under the banner of free speech. To me, that decision opened the floodgates to unchecked political spending, dark money, and disproportionate influence by the ultra-wealthy and powerful interest groups.

I believe this has led to:

	•	Unaccountable Super PACs spending billions with little transparency.

	•	Candidates beholden to donors, not voters, because campaigns are now insanely expensive when they likely wouldn’t be if Super PACs weren’t in bidding wars for ad time. Don’t even get me started on how some people in office can’t be bothered to attend a town hall with constituents. 

	•	Distorted public discourse, where those with the biggest megaphones (and more money than any reasonable coalition of voters could amass) shape the narrative.

	•	Widening political cynicism — many people feel like their vote or voice doesn’t matter when billionaires and corporations can outspend entire communities.

I think that in order to make a meaningful change your goals need to be specific and tailored. For example a good protest would be to go to a state house demanding that you want to be a sanctuary state. A bad protest would be to go to a state house to let them know how much you disagree with the president. 

A more effective (not the most effective) path towards social change would be email campaigns. You can directly tell the individual in power what change you want to see and why you want to see it and that you will not vote for them if this change is not enacted.

1jza96b,CMV: Donald Trump should be removed via Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution,"Section 4 of the 25th Amendment states:



""Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.



Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.""



I believe the President's Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office using this section. The 25th Amendment would also give cover to the Senate and the House to determine that the President is mentally incompetent, especially if there is evidence to support it. So it's safer for Congress to use this method instead of impeachment, because they can say that they support Trump, but that he ""lost his mental capacity.""



\*\*I think Congress would also be in their rights to hold votes through secret ballot as well, because they would like to protect their families from retaliation from an irrational President, who has shown a willingness to retaliate against anyone he perceives to be his enemy (\[see the attempted assassination of Nancy Pelosi by a supporter of his attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer in their home\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack\_on\_Paul\_Pelosi)), and who does not comply with the Rule of Law, or Due Process under the Constitution.\*\*



I think this would be a powerful argument because Trump's irrationality is self-evident through his own actions. For example, he is ignoring the advice of experienced experts in the government, he's instituting tariffs and rolling tariffs back, he's not following due process, and he's acting very irrationally. There is an unprecedented attack on our system of government, and there needs to be a determined and legally justifiable response to oust Trump, as soon as possible.



Through the 25th Amendment, the process would proceed as follows:







\- The VP and a majority of the Cabinet write a letter to the Senate President & House Speaker stating that Trump is not mentally competent, and the VP will assume the Presidency



\- Trump writes a letter back, stating that he is mentally competent, and attempts to take the power back



\- The VP & Cabinet write another letter stating that he is not mentally competent, and prevents him from taking the power back



\- The Senate and House must convene within 48 hours and rule by a 2/3 vote that Trump is or is not mentally competent within 21 days, this can be done by secret ballot for the safety of members of Congress







This is a historic moment, and I believe drastic steps need to take place to save our system of government. This is a legal method. :) People need to use their personal and institutional influence to lobby for this to happen, because our systems of government are under attack and we are at risk of losing everything.

1jsmudk,CMV: There were no protestors paid to attend the protests across the us yesterday.,"Looking at the republican subs as well as their media I've seen a lot of talk about paid protestors. Rogan famously quipped that protestors were being paid $1400 each to protest.

I've seen zero evidence of this occurring. 

Some criteria for my claim. 

What is a paid protestor? Someone who is paid to go to a protest. 

What this doesn't cover? Organizations do exist and often engage in logistics. They may print signs or bring in sound equipment, etc. This is different than the claim that protestors were being paid to attend the protests across the us yesterday. 

Organizers are not protestors. Here's why. J6 was organized by women for America first. A pro trunp organization led by Amy Kremer. This group worked on securing permits, booking speakers, getting a stage and sound system, etc. This does not mean that Amy Kremer paid those present at January 6th, and the January 6ers were also not paid protesters. 

Women for America first is also not a non profit organization which means it is far less transparent than other groups that are doing similar logistics. Unlike many non profits. The origins of the funding for Women for America first have never been disclosed. Really. We have no idea who paid for January 6. However, even in this extreme example I wouldn't argue that J6ers were paid protestors. 

What would change my view? Evidence anyone attending the protestors yesterday was being paid for protesting. ",WhiteRoseRevolt,1447,665,0.7900000214576721,0.2599223334728546,1743916921,/r/changemyview/comments/1jsmudk/cmv_there_were_no_protestors_paid_to_attend_the/,2025,4

1k2w2c4,CMV: We are witnessing the end of Pax Americana in real time,"For context, I am not American and these are my views from the stance of a person living in a Western nation allied to America.

**1. The end of the American economic order**

Donald Trump's tariffs are from my POV, completely insane. Each of their stated goals are completely contradictory from each other, way too broad and universal to have any of the useless effects a properly though-out tariff policy would have, and target many of America's allies. Not only that, when Trump started the trade war with China, they completely crumbled against the pressure and exempted China's key hi-tech industries and are begging Xi Jinping to call the White House for a ""deal"". With bilateral trade basically not existing anymore, China can still source a lot of their US imports (which from what I gather are primarily agricultural products) from other countries, but America is screwed as they relied on China for a lot of renewable and computer tech. The dollar is weakening, and China is sitting on a ton of the USD reserves they can unleash to seriously damage America's ability to finance its debts.

I really don't want to be a doomer, but the US really seems to be in a precarious position. It seems like America wants to achieve autarky and isolate from the global market, but it seems like they are approaching it in the worst way imaginable as they are simultaneously weakening their's and their allies' positions while strengthening China's. We're not even past 100 days of Trump's presidency.

**2. End of the rule of law in America**

With Trump ignoring a Supreme Court order, the judiciary is left with no enforcement mechanism to make the executive comply. That just leaves the legislative branch as the final check through impeachment, but I very much doubt this will happen even if the Democrats sweep the midterms. The Trump administration is literally wiping their ass with established norms and the rule of law, and the worst part is that it seems that a sizeable portion of the American public is either ambivalent or supportive of this.

I won't go as far as to say that this will cause a civil war down the line, but I do believe that if this trajectory continues, then America is looking at an extremely turbulent period that I would imagine would be akin to the Years of Lead in Italy. Combined with the economic troubles that I mentioned earlier, it seems very likely for America to become even more insular, unstable, and even authoritarian.

**3. Geopolitical Instability**

America has completely abdicated any semblance of responsibility over being world police--case in point, Ukraine. Now, I very much recognise that the merits of being world police is a debatable topic, however, I think its just a fact that--irrespective of whether or not you think America has the moral duty to ensure a fledgeling democracy is not invaded by an imperialist power--I think that it just makes good geopolitical sense to ensure Ukraine wins or at least stalemates against a nation that is actively hostile to Western interests. The only conflicts that Trump is willing to take sides with seems to be countries that he has personal financial interests in (I think he has or at least wants to build a Trump tower in Moscow although I might be wrong on that and he definitely has assets in Israel for example).  
  
If, tomorrow, China declares war on Taiwan, it seems very unlikely for the US to lift a finger. All it takes is one direct encroachment into what used to be America's red line, and the world will find out that the America giant has fallen asleep again.

**Conclusion**

All in all, it is very hard for me to be optimistic about the longevity of American hegemony in the 21st century. I have personal gripes about America and the imposition of their will in my home countries' politics, however, I still do believe they are LEAGUES better than the alternative of China or Russia or any other nations in the ""axis of evil"". Trump has completely set alight the power of America--both soft and hard--for no apparent reason. He is not only dumb, in my view, but also weak. Even if you take the MAGA movement's purported goals at face value and agree that they are sound, they have achieved none of it. Best case scenario is that the current Trump presidency is just a bout of insanity that will take years to recover from. Worst case is that Trump has set alight a fuse to a bomb that will blow up in all of our faces some time in the future and end the American hegemony for better or worse.

Helping other dictators achieve their goals and stay in power, while also full throatedly supporting and praising them.

Their vast fortunes are often built on the backs of underpaid labor, exploiting loopholes and manipulating systems for personal gain (rent-seeking), and hoarding resources that could be used to benefit everyone.

1kaq24g,CMV: Nothing will fix the Democratic brand,"It’s become increasingly clear the American Democratic Party is in need of rehabilitation. As I’ve discussed in a past post on here (with more of a focus on the Senate), the map of competitive states has shrunken to near-fatal levels—to hold the Senate, Democrats must hold 12-14 (depending on if they can win Maine back from the invincible Susan Collins and whether they hold the VP tiebreaker) of the 14 swing state Senate seats. Since 2008, Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, Ohio, Arkansas, and West Virginia have all become noncompetitive seats that Dems used to be able to win. Additionally, the census after 2030 makes the blue wall not enough for Democrats to win the presidency. New swing states are not opening up, nor is there any reason to believe this is possibility—if anything, new swing states will be formerly Democratic states like New Hampshire or New Mexico.

Even so, Democratic leadership is unwilling or unable to acknowledge the scale of the problem. The Senate map is the most polarized it’s been in 100 years. Every Democratic Senator from a red state has lost. The party faces a leadership crisis, but is committed to sabotaging anyone who’s too progressive who might step up (see Wasserman-Schultz’s sabotage of Bernie, Pelosi’s sabotage of AOC, the DNC’s threats towards David Hogg).

In red states, the party is perceived as radical socialists who only care about guns and gender issues, both of which are extremely unpopular, but something that the party has been unwilling to examine (see the election of David Hogg to DNC vice chair, party response to Seth Moulton’s comments expressing skepticism on the trans focus). Democrats face record unpopularity. Yet, even as Trump’s approval rating falls, the Democratic disapproval is actually INCREASING. No matter what Republicans do or how badly they fuck up, Democrats are seen as worse. Nothing suggests the party is prepared to confront their unelectability in massive portions of the country. It’s only getting worse with no reason to believe things will reverse course. I’m not even convinced that things **can** change. I think Republicans could run a Holocaust and a good 35–40% would still say “well, at least the Democrats aren’t in charge”.

1jps0hk,CMV: America is actually a really great place to be in,"Despite it's political issues, America is a really good place to be in. 

1. It is one of the most accepting countries in the world. Despite what the republicans are trying to do and what the democrats are saying about it, America is still one of the most inclusive countries in the world. For starters, there are not a lot of countries in general where minorities are accepted, and racism is prevalent in lots of the world. 
2. America is also placed in a really good geographic location. A lot of conflicts brewing are going on in Europe, The Middle East or in Asia. America has an entire ocean between these conflicts and even assuming American involvement in these conflicts (Which seems less likely with the new administration), a lot of people won't experience the effects of this first hand because of how far away it is. That means America is also relatively stable, as there is very little risk of invasion of the continental United States. And add the fact that America is moving isolationist and already has one of the smallest percentage of imports accounting for GDP means that it's extremely well-placed to weather out any storms. 
3. America also has a bright future. America is extremely unlikely to experience a ""brain drain"" and a lot of smart people from other countries are still immigrating into America. Its economy will most likely rebound after the current administration, and the country also has a lot of natural resources, which are becoming more scarce by the day. It is also at the forefront of technological innovation, with it leading multiple sectors. 
4. Americans have lots of freedoms. American are one of the freest people in the world, able to say nearly anything they want. In a lot of countries, including Korea and some European countries, free speech is limited. Americans can mock the president, make fun of the government and go out and protest which is not a very common right. Americans are also able to own guns, which is unheard of elsewhere.

1jz2qrf,CMV: NATO is a paper tiger without the US,"Let me preface by saying I am not anti-NATO or anti-US involvement in NATO. I am all for the alliance and cooperation between its members and wholeheartedly disagree with our current President’s stance on the US commitment to NATO, our other allies, and Ukraine. But.

Trump, and the Presidents before him that have said the same, are right to demand that our partners in NATO pull their weight. And never has that been more clear why that’s needed than right now.

Recently, 31 countries formed what they called a “coalition of the willing” that would step up and send troops to Ukraine to help maintain any kind of peace that would come of the war. Yet now, it is being reported that only 6 of those countries actually consider themselves ready and willing to put ground forces in Ukraine amid fears the US would refuse to join a peacekeeping mission.

Amid all the recent dumb shit decisions regarding our security commitments to Europe by the current administration, many politicians, citizens, and users online have been very vocally advocating for the rest of NATO to step up and take over where the US is failing right now, and this coalition was treated as step in that direction.

But time and time again, many European countries, Canada, and many of our western non-NATO Allie’s like Australia and New Zealand show they’re all talk when it comes to security guarantees. Their militaries are all* underfunded and facing huge recruitment crises. Yet they tout providing arms to Ukraine as a huge win while collectively providing a fraction of the US has, and usually resulting in military units being left with serious deficits of equipment to provide to Ukraine while waiting on replacements.

It seems pretty clear to me, that under the current situation there’s no feasible way NATO could remain the effective global security alliance it has been if the United States really were to withdraw from its commitments, and anyone who thinks it could without serious hard changes being made that need time to bear fruit needs to wake up.

*I should elaborate that I am mostly referring to Western Europe with these criticisms. Many Eastern European countries invest heavily in defense, but even then I don’t think they have what it takes to go it alone, many are still decades behind the US in terms of military technology, doing their best to phase out Cold War equipment.",The-wirdest-guy,373,916,0.6399999856948853,0.21645540162691246,1744647108,/r/changemyview/comments/1jz2qrf/cmv_nato_is_a_paper_tiger_without_the_us/,2025,4

1k6z9hi,CMV: Trump wasn’t wrong to demand NATO allies spend the amount agreed upon in 2014 on defense.,"And yes I know that on Reddit, Trump is always wrong. If he said the sky was blue, it'd be a nazi dog whistle.

Please leave the trump hate aside and give me a real reason why it was acceptable for our NATO allies to not spend the agreed upon amount from 2014-2022.

In 2014 after Russia's takeover of Crimea, NATO members agreed to increase defense spending to 2% of their respective GDPs.

They did this because of the clear and present danger to the east named Putin. They did they so that they would be prepared if Russia were to invade Ukraine again.

Even after Trump kept bringing it up in NATO meetings, only 6 members were spending the agreed upon amount all the way until 2022.

In 2022, what was feared happened. Russia invaded Ukraine. By 2024, a little over 20 member states are paying the agreed upon amount.

Herein lies the issue. This is like not studying for a math exam until the morning before, then asking if you can cheat off of your friend who studied for weeks.

Military spending takes time to develop, create, and stockpile weaponry. Most of the EU NATO countries are 6 years behind on what was agreed upon.

European defenses should be 6 years more developed than they are now. They should have multiple times the military stockpiles that they do.

So other than trump being hitler, what are some reasons why it is acceptable for them to rely on our military aid when they won't honor their monetary agreements?",Equal_Personality157,361,918,0.5799999833106995,0.2158082624185972,1745518579,/r/changemyview/comments/1k6z9hi/cmv_trump_wasnt_wrong_to_demand_nato_allies_spend/,2025,4
1k1jw7j,CMV: The International community unironically fueled the war in Gaza,"To start off: You won't change my mind on who started the conflict or who of the two sides is largely at fault, because today we are talking about the world's reaction to the war in Gaza - and how this reaction fueled it despite the constant calls for a ceasefire.



*1. Hamas' PR strategy fooled the entire world - and despite its success, the situation in Gaza is nowhere near good.*

There's no denying that the war has been a catastrophe for Palestinians, but what’s being overlooked is the role Hamas plays in this. Hamas has long used civilians as pawns in its military strategy, launching rockets and attacks from civilian areas like schools, hospitals, and mosques. They know that any retaliation from Israel will result in civilian casualties, which they can then exploit to fuel global outrage. 

**This strategy isn’t just reckless, it’s deliberate.** Hamas knows that every innocent death in Gaza brings more pressure on Israel to cease fire, yet it has shown no intention of changing its tactics because it gets little to no backlash, even though they are causing immense harm to its own people. Despite this strategy, Gaza is in complete ruins and the Israeli government are not even considering to end the war until Hamas' surrender and the release of the remaining hostages.



*2. The International community's one sided approach backfired horribly.*

Pushing for ceasefires and imaginary 2-state solutions don’t address the root cause of the current war: Hamas’s terrorism and the threat it poses to innocent Israeli civilians. 

The international community is only extending the war, because each time the world calls for a ceasefire without putting significant pressure on Hamas and its allies to surrender and release all of the hostages - which are, surpisingly one of the main reasons the war is still ongoing. This **emboldens Hamas AND the Israeli government.** The longer this goes on, the more extremist factions on both sides gain influence.

Which leads me to my most important point:

  
*3. Netanyahu’s political survival heavily depended on international pressure to cover his failure on October 7th.*

The international community’s insistence on condemning Israel’s military actions without holding Hamas accountable for its role in starting the war played directly into Netanyahu’s hands. The October 7th massacres was the largest single-day slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. Over 1,200 civilians were killed, shot in their homes, burned alive, raped, tortured, mutilated. Entire families were wiped out. **For Israelis, this wasn’t just another terrorist attack - it was a trauma that redefined national security forever.**

 Within weeks, the world seemed to move on. The conversation became “stop the war on Gaza"" and ""Condemn Israel"" while Israeli survivors who spoke out were often silenced and dismissed. The shocking brutality of the massacre was barely even emphasized by the UN. 

**This sudden moral whiplash devastated Israeli society - especially leftists** who had their comrades kidnapped and murdered despite many who had long advocated for Palestinian rights. They found themselves abandoned, accused, and demonised instead. 

That emotional fracture will probably never heal, and as a result **this gave Netanyahu more political support as the war continued.** The more the world pressures Israel to cease its military actions without addressing the root issue, the stronger Netanyahu’s position becomes. He uses international condemnation as a political shield as he presents himself as the lone leader of Israel facing the international community's hypocrisy.

  
4. *The hostages are one of the keys to end the war, yet they are either ignored or overshadowed by Palestinian casualties.*

A very common pro-Palestine speaking point is that the Israeli hostages are an afterthought: They're either dead already by ""Israeli bombings"" or not important as there are way more dead Palestinians - However **they are one of the keys to end the war on Gaza as stated by the Israeli public and government.** Besides some strong voices urging for their release, **most of the political pressure was put on Israel instead of dividing them equally between Hamas and Israel.** As a result to this day, Hamas continues to hold the hostages despite suffering greatly on the battlefield. Instead most of the focus and blame went on Israel.

Militarily, Hamas is doomed - they cannot rearm, cannot pay wages to their fighters and they cannot cause any significant casualties to the IDF anymore. If they were pressured both militarily and politically - there's a good chance they would have surrendered already.



*5. The international community missed an historic chance to ally itself with Israelis who oppose Netanyahu.*

Anti-Netanyahu Israelis and the International community have more common interests than they care to admit: They both want the release of the hostages, the end to the war and the ousting of Netanyahu's government. However, many in the international community point to Netanyahu and his government as if they represent all of Israel. Just like addressed in (3), the Israeli public was devestated by the world's one sided response - and this was a huge blunder.

Before this war, Israel was deeply divided - many Israelis were already protesting against Netanyahu’s authoritarian moves, especially after his controversial judicial overhaul in 2023. This wasn't just about foolish politics but a real threat to Israel's democracy. 

When the world condemns Israel as a whole, without acknowledging the internal struggles, i**t ignores those who want to see real change in their government.** This simplistic narrative makes it harder for Israelis fighting for a new government to gain momentum. Netanyahu has used the war as an excuse to silence opposition while framing it as a fight for Israel’s survival. By focusing on him alone, the world is ignoring the broader picture of Israel’s political landscape.

Netanyahu relies on this war to continue - but instead of addressing the root issue of the hostages and Hamas' aggression, it strengthens his stance by grouping the entirety of Israel with him.

And finally, one last thing to point out since we're already here:

  
*6. The voices in Gaza calling for Hamas to surrender are being ignored or outright silenced by the international community.*

Despite the overwhelming international focus on the suffering of Palestinians caused by IDF, there are also voices within Gaza itself calling for an end to Hamas’s rule. On several occasions, protests have broken out in Gaza, with people demanding that Hamas surrender and stop using them as human shields. These protests are often branded as ""anti-Israel"" or ""anti-war"" despite the calls against Hamas. Even so, some prominent protesters were brutally murdered by Hamas in retaliation. 

These calls are rarely covered by mainstream media or, ironically, mentioned by many pro-Palestinian activists who claim to stand for the rights of Palestinian civilians.



To put it all together, This war could’ve ended early - if the world had tipped the first domino. 

That domino was Hamas. Instead, the international community tried its hardest to trip the one behind it - The Israeli government, and in doing so, jammed the whole chain. The result? More death, more destruction, and the survival of the very leaders everyone wanted gone.",DragonfruitSpecial77,422,875,0.6100000143051147,0.21250749464938512,1744914229,/r/changemyview/comments/1k1jw7j/cmv_the_international_community_unironically/,2025,4
1k355md,"CMV: If a person is misled about someone’s age and engages in consensual sex with them, they shouldn’t be charged with any form of sexual assault or rape if they acted in good faith.","I want to present a perspective that I believe is often overlooked, and I’m curious to hear differing opinions.

Let’s say you’re a 21-year-old at a bar, a place where everyone is assumed to be of legal drinking age (21+). You meet someone there, they seem to be around your age, you flirt, and after some time, you both decide to hook up. Later, it turns out that the person you had sex with is underage — let’s say they used a fake ID or somehow misled you into believing they were of legal age.

In this situation, I don’t think the person who engaged in consensual sex should be charged with rape or sexual assault, assuming there was no malicious intent or clear signs of deception from their side. The individual who misrepresented their age is the one at fault, not the person who was misled.

Some points to consider:

Context matters: A bar is an adult venue, and the environment signals that all participants are of legal age. If someone enters that space and behaves like an adult, it’s reasonable to assume they are of age. There’s no obligation for a person to demand birth certificates or additional verification if everything else in the environment suggests they’re dealing with an adult.

Deception is the issue: The primary concern here is deception. If someone is underage and uses a fake ID or lies about their age, they are the ones responsible for the situation. It’s unreasonable to expect a person to be a mind reader and figure out someone's real age based on superficial details.

Personal responsibility: I understand the importance of personal responsibility, but in this case, the responsibility to verify should fall on the person who is actively lying about their age, not the one who is unknowingly misled. It’s not the person who acted in good faith based on the circumstances who should face criminal charges. It’s the one who created the false narrative.


I get that there are emotional and psychological impacts in situations like this, but I believe those impacts don’t justify criminalizing someone for acting based on the information they had at the time. In these cases, the law should focus on punishing the deceiver who used fraudulent means to mislead another person, not the person who was deceived.",ManasJain11,1305,484,0.8799999952316284,0.21118329376177167,1745093430,/r/changemyview/comments/1k355md/cmv_if_a_person_is_misled_about_someones_age_and/,2025,4
1jvpmw6,CMV: The “gifted” programs in the early 2000s did more harm than good for most kids in them.,"I was part of a “gifted and talented” program in elementary and middle school during the late ’90s/early 2000s. At the time, it felt special — we got pulled out of class for enrichment activities, harder material, or independent projects. But looking back, I honestly think it screwed a lot of us up.

It gave kids a false sense of superiority without teaching real-world skills like effort, resilience, or how to fail. We were constantly praised for being “smart” rather than working hard, so when we eventually hit a wall (college, jobs, burnout), we didn’t know how to handle it. A lot of the kids I knew from gifted programs now struggle with anxiety, perfectionism, or a fear of mediocrity.

Meanwhile, it often created unnecessary separation from other students and didn’t actually prepare us for adult life — it just made us better at standardized tests.

I’m not saying all enrichment is bad, but I think the way gifted programs were handled back then set a lot of us up for emotional whiplash.

Change my view.

1kbrkch,CMV: The United States would be a more just and united country today if the Union had imposed draconian punishments on the Confederacy after the Civil War,"This is a follow-up/enhancement to a recent post on this subreddit titled ""CMV: The American Civil War should have ended with mass executions"".  I thought that post was a good start, but I wanted to take the idea even further.  
  
The failure of the Union to decisively dismantle Confederate ideology and power structures after the Civil War was a critical mistake that enabled white supremacist terrorism and regional grievance culture to persist for generations. If the Union had treated the Confederacy as a treasonous insurrection and responded with uncompromising punishment—including executions of leadership, long-term military occupation, land redistribution, and the criminalization of Confederate symbols—then I believe the United States would today be a more socially just, racially equal, and politically united country.

**Context**:  
After the Civil War, the federal government pursued a relatively lenient policy toward the defeated South. Confederate leaders were not executed; many quickly regained political influence. Efforts to protect the rights of freed slaves during Reconstruction were eventually abandoned. This led to the rise of the ""Lost Cause"" mythology, the creation of Jim Crow laws, and racial terror groups like the KKK. Confederate monuments were erected decades later, and even today, states fly Confederate flags and debate whether the Civil War was ""about states' rights.""

I think all of this could have been prevented—or at least severely limited—if the federal government had acted more decisively in the 1860s and 70s.

**My Argument**:

If the Union had enacted a policy of **total dismantling** of the Confederacy—not just in terms of military defeat, but cultural, political, and economic erasure—the following benefits would likely have emerged:

1. **Abolition of Confederate Identity**:
   * Confederate leaders like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee could have been publicly tried and executed for treason.
   * Confederate flags, monuments, and songs could have been banned by federal law.
   * Southern schools and churches would be required to teach a pro-Union, anti-slavery narrative—preventing the Lost Cause myth from ever taking root.
2. **Lasting Protection of Black Civil Rights**:
   * A prolonged military occupation (20–30 years) could have kept Black voters, landowners, and politicians safe.
   * Land formerly owned by slaveholders could have been redistributed to freedmen.
   * A Black political class might have firmly taken root, with long-term representation at all levels of government.
3. **Economic Restructuring**:
   * Plantation landowners could have been dispossessed and barred from regaining political or economic power.
   * Northern industry and capital could have modernized the South with infrastructure and industry under federal control.
   * The region’s economy might have been diversified away from white-dominated agriculture much earlier.
4. **Suppression of White Supremacist Movements**:
   * Early iterations of the KKK and similar groups could have been ruthlessly dismantled by federal troops with legal authority.
   * Sympathy for such groups would be viewed socially and legally as treasonous rather than defensible under ""heritage.""
5. **Long-Term National Unity**:
   * The regional divide that still influences U.S. politics might have faded with a clearer victory and forced ideological realignment.
   * Racial grievance and Southern exceptionalism would be stigmatized and discredited early.

**Anticipated Counterarguments** (feel free to challenge these):

* “That level of punishment would’ve caused long-term insurgency.” → Possibly, but the South was already devastated; firm occupation could have prevented armed uprisings more effectively than leniency did.
* “You can’t force ideological change through punishment.” → Post-WWII Germany and Japan suggest otherwise—firm restructuring paired with education and democratization *can* work.
* “That would’ve been authoritarian and un-American.” → The Confederacy waged war to preserve slavery. The response needed to be just as morally clear and uncompromising.

**Change My View**:  
I'm open to hearing why this path would not have led to a better America. Would it have backfired long-term? Are there moral or practical limits to federal authority, even in the wake of treason? Would another approach have been more effective?

There were no antibiotics, no sterile surgeries, no trauma care. Nature was brutal back then. 

Now that we finally have the tools to fight diseases — yes, even if they’re “unnatural” — people suddenly want to throw it all away and go back to herbs? This is exactly how Steve Jobs died. He refused surgery for something treatable and chose the “natural” route — and it cost him his life.

1jswzwu,CMV: Refusing to acknowledge female privilege weakens feminism's moral consistency,"**The View:** This post refines and expands on a previous CMV that argued feminism must allow space for men to explore their gendered oppression - or risk reinforcing patriarchal norms. Many thoughtful responses raised important questions about how privilege is defined and applied asymmetrically across genders.

I believe in intersectional feminism. Feminism itself is not just a social movement but a political and moral ideology - like socialism or capitalism - that has historically led the way in making society fairer. But to maintain its moral authority, feminism must be willing to apply its analytical tools consistently. That includes recognizing when women benefit from gendered expectations, not just when they suffer under them.

To be clear from the start: This is not a claim that men have it worse than women overall. Women remain disadvantaged in many structural and historical ways. But the gendered harms men face—and the benefits women sometimes receive—also deserve honest scrutiny. In this post, ""female privilege"" refers to context-specific social, psychological, and sometimes institutional advantages that women receive as a byproduct of gendered expectations, which are often overlooked in mainstream feminist discourse.

Feminist literature often resists acknowledging female privilege. Mainstream theory frames any advantages women receive as forms of ""benevolent sexism"" - that is, socially rewarded traits like vulnerability, emotional expression, or caregiving, which are ultimately tools of subordination. Yet this interpretation becomes problematic when such traits offer real advantages in practical domains like education, employment, or criminal sentencing.

Some feminist thinkers, including Cathy Young and Caitlin Moran, have argued that feminism must do more to acknowledge areas where women may hold social or psychological advantage. Young writes that many feminists ""balk at any pro-equality advocacy that would support men in male-female disputes or undermine female advantage."" Moran warns that if feminism fails to “show up for boys,” others will exploit that silence.

To be clear, I’m not arguing that men- or anyone - should be treated as permanent victims. But anyone, of any gender, can be victimized in specific social contexts. When these patterns are widespread and sustained, they constitute systemic disadvantage. And if one gender avoids those harms, that’s what we should honestly call privilege.

Michael Kimmel observed: “Privilege is invisible to those who have it.” This applies to all identities - including women. As feminists often note, when you're used to privilege, equality can feel like oppression. That same logic now needs to apply where women hold gendered advantages. Failing to acknowledge these asymmetries doesn’t challenge patriarchal gender roles - it reinforces them, especially through the infantilizing gender role of women as delicate or less accountable. This narrative preserves women’s moral innocence while framing men’s suffering as self-inflicted.

Feminism has given us powerful tools to understand how gender norms harm individuals and shape institutions, and it carries with it a claim to moral responsibility for dismantling those harms wherever they appear. But to remain morally and intellectually coherent, feminism must apply those tools consistently. That means acknowledging that female privilege exists - at least in specific, situational domains.

This isn’t a call to equate women’s disadvantages with men’s, or to paint men - or anyone - as permanent victims. Rather, it’s to say that anyone of any gender can be victimized in certain contexts. And when those patterns are widespread enough, they constitute systemic oppression - and their inverse is privilege. If men’s disadvantages can be systemic, so too are women’s advantages. Calling those advantages “benevolent sexism” without acknowledging their real-world impact avoids accountability.

**What Is Privilege, Really?** Feminist theory generally defines privilege as systemic, institutional, and historically entrenched. But in practice, privilege operates across multiple domains:

* **Structural privilege** \- Legal and institutional advantages, such as exemption from military drafts, more lenient sentencing, or gendered expectations in employment sectors.
* **Social privilege** \-  The ability to navigate society with favorable expectations: being assumed emotionally available, having greater access to supportive peer networks, or being encouraged to express emotion without stigma. For example, women are more likely to be offered help when in distress, or to receive community support in personal crises.
* **Psychological privilege**  \- Deep-seated assumptions about innocence, moral authority, or trustworthiness. This includes cultural reflexes to believe women’s accounts of events more readily than men’s, or to assume women act from good intentions, even when causing harm. Studies show women are viewed as more honest—even when they lie—impacting credibility in disputes and conflict resolution.

Feminist theory critiques male privilege across all three. But when women benefit from gender norms, these advantages are often reframed as “benevolent sexism” - a byproduct of patriarchal control. This framing creates an inconsistency:

* If male privilege is “unearned advantage rooted in patriarchy,”
* And female privilege is “benevolent sexism” that also confers real advantage, also unearned, and also rooted in patriarchy—
* Then why not recognize both as gendered privilege?

If female privilege is “benevolent sexism,” should male privilege be called “callous sexism”? Both reward conformity to traditional gender roles. Why the rhetorical asymmetry?

**Structural Privilege: Who Really Has It?** Feminist analysis often responds by saying women don't have privilege because men have structural privilege. But how widespread is this in reality?

|Domain|Feminist Claim|What It Shows|Counterpoint / Nuance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Political Representation|Men dominate government leadership|Men hold most top positions|Laws still restrict men (e.g., military draft) and women (e.g., abortion rights)|
|Corporate Leadership|Men dominate elite business roles|<1% of men are CEOs|Most men are workers, not beneficiaries of corporate power|
|Legal System|Law favors male interests|Men face 37% longer sentences for same crimes|Harsh sentencing tied to male-coded behavioral expectations|
|Wealth and Wages|Men earn more|Wage gaps persist in high-status roles|Gaps shaped by risk, overtime, occupation, and choice|
|Military & Draft|Men dominate military|Men make up 97% of combat deaths and all draftees|Gendered sacrifice is not privilege|
|Workforce Representation|Women underrepresented in STEM|Some jobs skew male (STEM, construction)|Others skew female (teaching, childcare), where men face social barriers|

This shows that structural power exists - but it doesn’t equate to universal male benefit. Most men do not control institutions; they serve them. While elites shape the system, the burdens are widely distributed - and many fall disproportionately on men. Many of the disparities attributed to patriarchy may actually stem from capitalism. Yet mainstream feminism often conflates the two, identifying male dominance in elite capitalist roles as proof of patriarchal benefit - while ignoring how few men ever access that power.

**Under Acknowledged Female Privilege (Social and Psychological):**

* **Victimhood Bias:** Women are more likely to be believed in abuse or harassment cases. Male victims - especially of psychological abuse - often face disbelief or mockery (Hine et al., 2022).
* **Emotional Expression:** Women are socially permitted to express vulnerability and seek help. Men are expected to be stoic - contributing to untreated trauma and higher suicide rates. bell hooks wrote that “patriarchy harms men too.” Most feminists agree. But it often goes unstated that patriarchy harms men in ways it does not harm women. That asymmetry defines privilege.
* **Presumption of Trust:** A 2010 TIME report found women are perceived as more truthful - even when lying. This grants them greater social trust in caregiving, teaching, and emotional roles. Men in these contexts face suspicion or stigma.
* **Cultural Infantilization:** Female wrongdoing is often excused as stress or immaturity; male wrongdoing is condemned. Hine et al. (2022) found male victims of psychological abuse are dismissed, while female perpetrators are infantilized. Women’s gender roles portray them as weaker or more in need of protection, which grants leniency. Men’s gender roles portray them as strong and stoic, which diminishes empathy. The advantages that men may have historically enjoyed - such as being seen as more competent - are rightly now being shared more equally. But many advantages women receive, such as trust and emotional support, are not. This asymmetry is increasingly visible.

**Why This Inconsistency Matters:**

* It originates in academic framing. Much of feminist literature avoids acknowledging female privilege in any domain. This theoretical omission trickles down into mainstream discourse, where it gets simplified into a binary: women as oppressed, men as oppressors. As a result, many discussions default to moral asymmetry rather than mutual accountability.
* It alienates potential allies. Men who engage with feminism in good faith are often told their pain is self-inflicted or a derailment. This reinforces the binary, turning sincere engagement into perceived threat. By doing this, we implicitly accept ""callous sexism"" toward men and boys as normal. This invites disengagement and resentment - not progress.
* It erodes feminist credibility. When feminism cannot acknowledge obvious social asymmetries—like differential sentencing, emotional expressiveness, or assumptions of innocence - it appears selective rather than principled. This weakens its claim to moral leadership.
* It creates a messaging vacuum. Feminism’s silence on women’s privilege - often the inverse of men’s disadvantage - creates a void that populist influencers exploit. The Guardian (April 2025) warns that misogynistic and Franco-nostalgic views among young Spanish men are spreading - precisely because no trusted mainstream discourse offers space to address male hardship in good faith.  No trusted space to talk about male identity or hardship in a fair, nuanced way, is leading boys to discuss it in the only spaces where such discussion was welcome - in misogynist and ultimately far-right conversations.
* It encourages rhetorical shut-downs. My previous post raised how sexual violence—undeniably serious—is sometimes invoked not to inform but to silence. It becomes a moral trump card that ends conversations about male suffering or female privilege. When areas women need to work on are always secondary, and female advantages seem invisible, it is hard to have a fair conversation about gender.

**Anticipated Objections:**

* **“Men cannot experience sexism.”** Only true if we define sexism as structural oppression - and even that is contested above. Men face widespread gendered bias socially and psychologically. If those patterns are systematic and harmful, they meet the same criteria we apply to sexism elsewhere.
* **“Female privilege is just disguised sexism.”** Possibly. But then male privilege is too. Let’s be consistent.
* **“Women are worse off overall.”** In many structural areas, yes. But that doesn’t erase advantages in others.

**The manosphere is not the root cause of something - it is a symptom.** Across the globe, there is growing sentiment among young men that feminism has “gone too far.” This is usually blamed on right-wing algorithms. But many of these young men, unable to articulate their experiences in feminist terms and excluded from feminist spaces where they could learn to do so, are simply responding to a perceived double standard and finding places where they are allowed to talk about it. They feel injustice - but in progressive spaces are told it is their own bias. This double standard may be what fuels backlash against feminism and left wing messaging.

**Conclusion:** Feminism doesn’t need to center men or their issues. But if it wants to retain moral authority and intellectual coherence, it must be willing to name all forms of gendered advantage - not just the ones that negatively affect women. Recognizing structural, social, and psychological female privilege does not deny women’s oppression. It simply makes feminism a more honest, inclusive, and effective framework-  one capable of addressing the full complexity of gender in the 21st century.

1k61g2h,CMV: Pickup Trucks are (Almost) Entirely Pointless,"I live in the western United States, where pickup trucks are king. From my perspective trucks, particularly full-size and midsize trucks (which are the size of full-sized trucks of a few years ago) are almost entirely pointless other than for play-acting, and that a van (I mean a real van like a sprinter or a ford e-series) is better in almost every case. I will start with the exceptions:  


1. Stinky or dirty cargo. If you have a business picking up dog poop, by all means use a pickup truck. That said you probably don't need a full size, a maverick would hold a prodigious amount of poo. 

2. Quick or special-purpose loading: if you are throwing in trash bags, throwing out bales of hay, or getting a load of rocks from a tractor, sur, a truck makes sense. 

3. (Mildly) Large Cargo: there are some instances where something is too large to fit in a van but will fit in a pickup truck bed. Something like a small tree, or something that barely sticks out of the bed. Of course, if it is too big it will just fall out, notwithstanding efforts to tie it down. 

4. Towing a fifth-wheel: No argument here. You have to have a pickup truck for that. Of course, you ruin your bed, so that is basically a dedicated tow vehicle.  

Other than these exceptions, a van clearly dominates. Your cargo is more secure from theft, safe from weather and less likely to fall out or need to be tied down. You also have a far more versatile vehicle that can be used to travel the country in comfort, camped in, etc. The existence of shells for trucks basically show that people really wanted a van, but decided to make one themselves rather than just buy one.

Overall, I think people mostly buy pickup trucks for two reasons:

1. Big = good.

2. Play-acting. Pickup trucks can be used to tow, haul, and off road. One day I may want to pretend that I will do one of those things.

  
All of this said, I know the that the truck is deeply ingrained in the American psyche. Despite feeling this way, I have considered buying one several times (gotta love cognitive dissonance.). Maybe I am missing something. CMV.

1jpbxqn,CMV: Republican ire for DEI initiatives generally ignores the fact that the primary beneficiaries of such initiatives have been white women,"Many republicans frame the issue of DEI as wrongfully benefiting minorities. They suggest many minorities are receiving career opportunities largely not based upon merit but primarily due to their minority status. This, however, ignores the fact that the primary beneficiaries of such initiatives have not been minorities. The primary beneficiaries of such policies have been white women. 

I believe you cannot have a proper discussion about DEI without discussing this fact. If I am wrong, please kindly tell me how.

1jzxel2,CMV: MAGA and the new conservative movement that grew from Trump will fracture and die with him,"I don’t think the MAGA movement survives Donald Trump.

Not in the form it exists today, anyway. Trump didn’t just ride a wave of conservative populism, he became the wave. What we now call MAGA isn’t built on a platform or a coherent ideology. It’s built around a man. When he’s gone, politically, physically, or otherwise, I think what’s left will split, fracture, and ultimately lose most of the energy that made it so dominant.

The reason I say this is because, to me, MAGA is less of a movement and more of a cult of personality. Trump provided something the American far-right hadn’t had in a long time: a charismatic figurehead willing to be as loud, unfiltered, and combative as they are. He validated and amplified the angriest corners of the conservative base, the folks who for years felt ignored or dismissed by traditional Republicans. But I don’t see anyone else in his orbit who commands that same visceral loyalty. Ron DeSantis, JD Vance, Nikki Haley, they’re all trying to echo Trump’s style, but none have his draw. Without him at the center, the movement loses its gravitational pull.

I think we’ll see a power vacuum emerge when Trump is no longer politically viable. And history shows us that these types of vacuums rarely end with a smooth transfer of influence. Movements that are too centered on one figure often fall apart when that figure exits. Think of Ross Perot and the Reform Party, or even what happened to Perónism in Argentina after Juan Perón died. The infrastructure might remain, but the energy and direction falter.

I also think there’s a deep split coming, one that already exists beneath the surface, between the wealthy class of MAGA supporters and the working-class base. The rich Trump-aligned figures, the political insiders, donors, and media moguls, are in it because his presidency was good for their business or their access. They’ll move on and try to back whoever keeps the cash flowing or the tax breaks coming. But the working-class voters who saw Trump as their voice? I don’t think they ever really got what they wanted out of him. They got attention, but not much meaningful policy. Without Trump himself feeding that sense of rebellion and grievance, I suspect that wing of the movement will struggle to remain relevant, or at least unified.

So my view is that once Trump is gone, MAGA as we know it collapses. It might rebrand or morph into something else, but the current iteration will die without its central figure.

Change my view. I’m open to arguments that someone else could credibly take up the mantle, or that the ideology is strong enough on its own to outlive him. But to me, it feels like this movement lives and dies with Donald Trump.",superdino1234,1199,303,0.8500000238418579,0.165590007283824,1744737271,/r/changemyview/comments/1jzxel2/cmv_maga_and_the_new_conservative_movement_that/,2025,4
1k5upf0,"CMV: Trump's tarrif war isn't stupidity or incompetence, he wants to tank the dollar.","1) Doge extracts 2+ trillion from the fed as a tax break for the rich. Meanwhile Trump and his inner circle are using his tarrif war to pump the economy for bill/trillion more (it's hard to know how much but they all start investing with 10-100s billions so they can get to trill faster than any of us). They're amassing capital. 
2)Trump said on day one he wanted to declare martial law, and signed EOs to get that ball rolling (something about immigrants). He cut USAID, farmers started posting videos about losing their farms because it was subsidizing many of them. He assaults immigrants,  farmers started  posting videos about not being able to run their farms. He enacted tarrifs and farmers posted videos about not being able to supply their farms. Farmers are losing their farms, that sounds like a food shortage this winter.  And that's just the kind of ""emergency "" Trump needs to declare that sweet, sweet  martial law. So he'll let it happen, who cares if the left calls him stupid for not seeing it coming.
3) They've been warning us for decades the dollar would fail, and in recent years sooner rather than later. Trump has antagonized Canada and Greenland with annexation, rewrote who was the aggressor in Ukraine and described the EU as designed to screw the US. No one trusts us. Noone wants to invest in us or buy our debt and they're starting to worry about using our currency, the default currency (or whatever it's called). Combine that with food shortages and unrest at home and that sounds to me like a recipe for how the dollar, already  struggling, finally fails.
4) At this point, with no currency, the US would  be bankrupt.  Banks get involved, you know, the banking system everyone loves and trusts and always have.  Can you think of anyone ( see point 1) who might, recently, have acquired the capital nessassary to pay the banks? Should an entity (maybe a real estate mogul) purchase the property south of Canada and north of Mexico it would become theirs. They wouldn't be any more beholden to the constitution than someone buying an abandoned factory is to the business that originally built it.  Trump, who operates his businesses this way, would then be free to reconstitute it as his personal corporate dictatorship (he said term 1 day 1 he wanted to be a dictator and has said he'd prefer to run the country like a business).  And while international law may have something to say about our fate, does Trump seem like someone who thinks he's answerable to the international community?

----I'm gonna wander a bit off topic here, this next bit is just for ""the lefties"". The above bit, though. I genuinely want you to change my view.----


If Trump (& the Heritage Foundation) is the wannabe tyrant it seems like he wants to be.
A) A ""food shortage"" is an effective way to hold an entire population down. I'd expect it to continue. Also, power and communications black outs, ""due to the food riots "". A good excuse to send troops after his enemies? Maybe relocate people to places ""he can supply food and power to"" (the US has done it before)? While he's saving us. I'd figure communications would return quickly enough, but only things propaganda compatible would be allowed. (I'm thinking about how they say TV is in China, N Korea, etc)

B) The mid terms will be too late. What few patriots are left in government need to know  if they move to incarcerate Trump and the heritage foundation loyalist we will be there in large enough number to prevent another Jan 6. They can't act if we aren't there to protect them and prove, once and for all, that trump's will isn't the will of the patriotic United States of America! 

Time is running out. We all have to come out. This isn't politics as usual. This year we may well decide if self governance was too hard. If we fundamentally believe in freedom, liberty and happiness for all, or if we feel like the great American experiment was a failure. It wasn't. call every elected and appointed official you can as offen as you can and TELL THEM! Show up at every protest you can. Go to your town halls. Ask the 60's, it works!

For any ""righties"" who made it this far, if you believe in the constitutional USA (and I think, deep down, even the angriest of you do), I hope you guys understand everyone over here is just worried the same corporations that corrupted our (our) system of government are finally making their move.  It's not really about Trump specifically,  we just think he's in on it. We may disagree about things, but in this system we each get to celebrate our sides victories or plan to win the other side over next time. The greatest victory is converting your opponent. And for the petty among us all, you get to poke at the other side like an a.. and no one  can really stop you.( But if you start it they can preach back at you, fairs fair, ;) )

1kbmvjo,CMV:  Protesting against Hamas will help Palestinian civilians more than protesting against Israel,"Unless you have been in a coma the last two-and-a-half years, you have witnessed a great number of Pro-Palestine activists protesting against the Israeli response to the Hamas attack on October 7^(th), condemning the loss of civilian lives in Gaza. 

 I agree, it is horrific.  Not only the loss of life, but the starvation and destruction as well.

Before I continue, please do me the favor of writing your answers down to these “Yes/No” questions on a piece of paper.  Please feel free to elaborate.  
  
1) Was Hamas justified in what it did on October 7^(th)? 

2)  Is the Israeli response justified?

3)  Should the Israeli response be considered a genocide?

4)  Were the Jews right to accept the land from the British in 1948?

5)  Were the Arabs right to declare war on the Jews in 1948?

6)  Were the Jews right to keep the land they won in the 1948 war?

7)  Was Israel right to keep the land it won in the 1967 war?

8)  Does the fact that Israeli forces left Gaza 20 years ago, only to be followed up immediately with attacks from Hamas justify the Israeli response?

9)  Does the fact that Israel still had control of the borders justify the Palestinian response?

10)  Are the Palestinians being held in Israeli jails being held unjustly?

11)  Should Israel let more aid into Gaza?

 Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions.

 

Please carefully read your answers and neatly fold up the piece of paper you used.

 Now throw it in the trash.

 Why am I asking you to throw your heartfelt opinions in the trash?  Because it doesn’t matter!  None of that is relevant at all!

**Rightly or wrongly**, it appears Israel will keep going until they get their hostages back.  Palestinian civilians will continue to be killed until Israel gets their hostages back from Hamas.

 

Protesting against Israel for two-and-a-half years has not helped stop the killing of Palestinians. 

Have these protestors really missed that single very important fact?

They have been protesting against Israel for two-and-a-half years and Palestinians are still being killed.

 

So why keep doing that instead of trying something different that might actually SAVE PALESTINIAN LIVES? 

I personally would suggest trying something different.

 

I would try protesting against Hamas and try to get them to release the hostages.  That WOULD actually help stop the killing of Palestinians.

 

I am not going to pick sides because both sides have done enough crap.  At this point it doesn’t matter who started it, who’s right, and who’s wrong.  If we want to save Palestinian lives we need to try something different, and try to get the hostages released so we can end this insanity.

 I know it’s much more popular to protest against Israel as opposed to protesting against Hamas, but please consider the Palestinian civilians and Palestinian children.  Will you continue to do what is popular, but not helping?  Or will you risk being unpopular, and protest against Hamas in an attempt to save Palestinian lives?

 

Of course if you want to continue protesting Israel please do.  I’m not saying it hurts.  But please consider protesting against Hamas.

 

Yes I know that releasing the hostages will not cure everything, and it will not totally stop the bloodshed in the region.  I’m not that naïve.  But it will at least help, and at least save some Palestinian lives.

 

That’s what I’m hoping for.

1k1bx02,CMV: We should have additional qualifications to be President of the United States beyond just being born here and over 35.,"The presidency is the most powerful position in the country, with massive influence over the economy, foreign policy, military decisions, and the overall direction of society.

1jsk3jm,CMV: There is no valid proof of God's existence,"I have evaluated the various arguments presented by religious individuals as ""proofs"" of God, but none of these are valid from a logical or verifiability standpoint.

I invite you to present what you think are valid proofs of God's existence.

I define ""valid"" (logically) as: Where the premises are true, and the conclusion follows from those premises. In other words, the conclusion must be derived from the premises.

I'll give you an example of one of the many proofs that don't follow logic and are logical fallacies:  
**God is the First Cause.**

Let me clarify why I won't consider it:

1. **If God is a literal synonym for the First Cause**, then the First Cause is a synonym for God, and these terms can be interchanged. This doesn't hold, because the First Cause, by definition, doesn't have the characteristics associated with God in various religions. Therefore, God, as understood in religions, is not proven to exist since all the other aspects that make up the figure of God, and on which various moral rules and dogmas are based, are not proven.
2. **If God is the First Cause, but not a synonym**, meaning God has the First Cause as one of His characteristics, then it's not proof. It doesn't prove God's existence with His various characteristics; it simply states that, since God is the beginning of everything, omnipotent, etc., He is the First Cause. And while it might make sense that there could be a First Cause of all things, the association of the other characteristics of God with the First Cause has not been proven.

To simplify, let's define these two terms:

* **First Cause:** The first cause without any additional connotations.
* **God:** The First Cause with the other characteristics associated with the figure of God in religions.

The reasoning that is often used is: If John (God) is a president (First Cause), and we are able to contact a president (First Cause), then it must be John (God).

Here’s another example: If it rains (God) when there are clouds (First Cause), then whenever there are clouds (First Cause), it must rain (God). But we all know that clouds can exist without necessarily leading to rain.

These two examples are **illogical**, **because the premises may be true, but they do not lead to a conclusion that can be derived from the premises**.
