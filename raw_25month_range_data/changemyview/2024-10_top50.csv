1fz8a7x,"CMV: Western right wingers and islamists would get along great, if it wasn't for ethnic and religious hatred.","They both tend to believe:

* That women should be subservient to men and can't be left to their own devices
* In strict gender roles that everyone must adhere to, or else
* That queer people are the scum of the earth
* That children should have an authoritarian upbringing
* In corporal and capital punishment
* That jews are evil

Because of this, I think the pretty much only reason why we don't see large numbers of radicalized muslim immigrants at, for example, MAGA rallies in the US, or at AfD rallies in Germany, is that western right wingers tend to view everyone from the Middle East and Central Asia as a barabaric idiot with terroristic aspirations, and islamists tend to view everyone who isn't a Muslim as an untrustworthy, degenerate heathen.",Fraeddi,4573,1621,0.7200000286102295,0.730557136603631,1728415606,/r/changemyview/comments/1fz8a7x/cmv_western_right_wingers_and_islamists_would_get/,2024,10
1g016fw,CMV: Being pro-Palestine is not antisemitic,"I suppose most of this line of thinking is caused by the people who want to erase Israel from the map entirely along with its Jewish inhabitants which is as antisemitic as it gets, so to clear up, I mean pro-Palestine as in: against having innocent Palestinians barely surviving in apartheid conditions and horrified by 40 000 people (and other 100 000 injured) being killed and it being justified by many / most of the world as rightful protection of the state. I am not pro-Hamas, I can understand a degree of frustration from being in a blockade for years, but what happened on October 7 was no doubt inhumane... but even calling what's been happening over the past year a war feels for how one-sided is the conflict really feels laughable (as shown by the death toll).  
  
I browsed the Jewish community briefly to try to see another point of view but I didn't expect to see the majority of posts just talking about how every pro-Palestinian is uneducated, stupid, suspectible to propaganda and antisemitic. Without explaining why that would be, it either felt like a) everyone in the community was on the same wave-length so there was no need to explain or b) they just said that to hate on anyone who didn't share their values. As an outsider, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it's possible that I hold my current views because I'm ""uneducated"", I have admittedly spent only a relatively short amount of time trying to understand the conflict and I'm not very good with keeping historical facts without having them written somewhere... but again, I reserve my right to identify what goes against basic human principles because it shouldn't ever be gatekept, so I doubt any amount of information would be able to make me switch 180 degrees suddenly, but there is room for some nuance. 

Anyway, I'm assuming the basic gist is: being pro-Palestine > being anti-Israel > being anti-Zionist > being antisemitic (as most Jews are in fact Zionists). I find this assessment to having made a lapse of judgement somewhere along the way. Similarly to how I'm pro-Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza, I'm not anti-Israel / Jewish people, I am against (at least morally, as I'm not a part of the conflict) what the Israel government is doing and against people who agree with their actions. I'm sorry that Jewish people have to expect antisemitism coming from any corner nowadays, as someone who is a part of another marginalized community I know the feeling well, but assuming everyone wants me dead just fuels the ""us vs them"" mentality.

1fzi81j,CMV: All transportation should be free out of evacuation zones. ,"Currently there is a massive problem with price gouging by airlines (supposedly now capped...) and it made me think...

If you are under a mandatory evacuation, you should not have to pay to evacuate. You are already likely going to lose your home. You may have no work to return to. You are limited in the possessions you can bring. And now you must also spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars just to leave? 

If an area falls under a mandatory evacuation and you live in that area, the government should be funding all of that. That should be part of FEMA to ensure everyone who has to evacuate doesn't need to worry about how. It would be easier and avoid fraud as well if we just did this up front instead of reimbursing people later. 

You tell the airlines ""there's a major hurricane how many people can you transport out of the area within X time"". Figure out how much it would cost. Create the guidelines for that many people. Do the same with trains and busses. If people are driving out (which should be a last resort because the more people who drive the more people who get trapped) the gas should be freely available. 

Any amount of ""fraud"" in a situation like this would be minimal. People will either pay to travel back or call it lost and stay put or travel somewhere else. You can coordinate with multiple airports/train/bus stations so that people get out of the hurricane zone to designated spots and they can either stay there or they can pay to travel somewhere else.

But they shouldn't have to worry about if they can afford to get out of the initial area. ",adhesivepants,5963,610,0.9300000071525574,0.6306209850107066,1728444000,/r/changemyview/comments/1fzi81j/cmv_all_transportation_should_be_free_out_of/,2024,10
1fyamjb,CMV: There is absolutely no good reason to hold a pro-Palestinian demonstration today (Oct 7) and it should be seen as glorification of terrorism,"It is the first anniversary of the horrific attack on Israel, yet streets in my city are full of pro-Palestinian protesters with their flags.

I believe that there is absolutely no good reason for them to be there today and it can only be explained as celebrating the terrorist attack. They could have chosen literally any other date. Oct 7 is irrevocably connected to the horrors of last year.

I can see possible explanations like ""it was the start of the violence in Palestine"", but it really wasn't. On Oct 7 last year, there was only violence in Israel. The retribution came only days later.

Arguments of the type ""they are there to demonstrate for ceasefire to stop suffering on both sides"" seem quite disingenuous to me as well.

1g8zgxy,CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal.,"I am not a conservative or a Trump supporter, I am simply tired of liberals now being seen as some kinf of ultimate good compared to the devils on the conservative side.

Malcolm x said that the White American who identifies as a liberal is the most ‘dangerous’ and ‘deceitful’ thing in the Western Hemisphere. He said that the issues concerning black Americans were raised by white liberals as part of a vicious power politics to get back at the white conservatives. In his own words, the liberals do so in order to gain power or retain power. 

This is fully seen in how the liberal of today talks about social justice and moral issues especially on Reddit. Issues that would traditionally be seen as important to liberals causes that affect minorities, and other contentious issues are thrown out the window as soon as it seems it may hurt the chances of a Democrat winning the election.

Malcolm said that conservatives are like wolves who make their intention to destroy you plain and compared liberals to foxes that hide their hand and plot when attempting to eat you. Many liberals on Reddit say things like if you even question Whether the democratic option is a good choice or matches your policies than you are aligned with fascism or don’t care about women/whichever other vulnerable demographic they can use as a card. This is manipulative and is reflective of Malcolm’s argument.

“The American negro is nothing but a political football and the white liberals control this ball. Through tricks, tokenism, and false promises of integration and civil rights…,” he remarked. Although he is talking about black people it applies to women, LGBTQ people, and more recently Arab communities. When it’s in fashion and low stakes, then it’s okay to criticize Israel for their crimes but when it’s election time we have to ignore all of their faults and behave as their #1 supporter.

This is the same behavior that Susan b Anthony behaved in when she joined white conservatives to lift up women at the cost of the allyship with enslaved people and abolitionists.",Expert-Diver7144,2485,1582,0.7200000286102295,0.5471263009831147,1729541461,/r/changemyview/comments/1g8zgxy/cmv_malcolm_x_was_correct_about_the_white/,2024,10

Another thing to also consider is the colonialism of Latin America is entirely different from the colonialism of Africa.

If you were to choose a colonizer you’d probably pick the Spainards. Now, they went to Latin America and intermixed with the population meaning that the people there now descend from BOTH Spainards and Natives. So who exactly are you gonna apologize to? All the people that colonized left Spain and Portugal. And you have BOTH spainard colonizer dna as well as native dna.

Now the real colonizers were the English, French, Japanese and the Turks. and yet everyone would rather just say “Europeans/White People are just evil colonizers” even though not every european country participated in colonialism and the colonialism was vastly different depending on the country.",Different_Salad_6359,656,1641,0.6000000238418579,0.4063977324837928,1729017755,/r/changemyview/comments/1g4f1jh/cmv_saying_whites_or_europeans_are_responsible/,2024,10
1fxdrrv,CMV: Elon Musk speaking at a Trump Rally in PA is the greatest gift you could possibly give to the Democratic Party. ,"As the title states. 

Just finished watching the Trump rally in Butler PA… and I am astounded by how out of touch and disconnected it was. 

Obviously, Elon Musk speaking at the event is going to be taking up most of the headlines covering this event. If I were a member of Kamala Harris’ team however, I would be ecstatic about this. 

A major narrative that her team has been trying to create is that a Trump presidency would mean more tax cuts and deferential policy directed towards the wealthiest members of society, all at the expense of everyday, working people. 

Based on this fact, it seems really counter-intuitive for the Trump campaign to openly play into this obvious talking point that the Harris team has created. Musk has been outspoken about his support on Twitter… but speaking at a Trump campaign rally is a MASSIVE change. 

What would be the rationalization to justify making this decision, which I view to be a complete mistake… Obviously Musk didn’t just show up, this was a coordinated campaign event. Seems really strange for both Musk (who’s car business has always been heavily dependent on Democratic support for electric vehicles) and Trump to make this decision so close to the election.

1g76j7o,CMV: “From the river to the sea” inherently supports a Palestinian one-state solution,"In Arabic there are THREE versions of the slogan. TWO of which call for the “decolonization” of the Israeli state. These two slogans were infamous during the First Intifada: min il-ṃayye la-l-ṃayye / Falasṭīn ʿarabiyye (من المية للمية / فلسطين عربية, ""from the water to the water / Palestine is Arab"" and min il-ṃayye la-l-ṃayye / Falasṭīn islāmiyye (من المية للمية / فلسطين إسلامية, ""from the water to the water / Palestine is Islamic"")

The THIRD is the one that made it’s way into English, because it rhymes, and because it is the only reasonable one—it doesnt call for the recolonization of a Palestinian state: From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free""—the translation of min an-nahr ʾilā l-baḥr / Filasṭīn sa-tatḥarrar

So there are three slogans used by entirely different demographic geographically, culturally, and ideologically. Israelis are connected to western media, but also the immediate Palestinian sentiments surrounding them. They hear all three of these slogans. This is the true disconnect between all of these peoples. 

I often see interviews of people rallying say they support a one state, democratic solution. After all, two ethno-states where citizens of each do not have equal rights in the other would be the _definition_ of apartheid—supposedly what we are trying to end. 

That is why when I hear this slogan it means to me:

2) Belief in a one state solution.",Imjustmisunderstood,776,1451,0.6899999976158142,0.375774556948434,1729336075,/r/changemyview/comments/1g76j7o/cmv_from_the_river_to_the_sea_inherently_supports/,2024,10
1fz67ym,CMV: Haiti is not a failed state but a victim of colonization and revenge,"With the recent tragedies going on in Haiti due to gang violence and the assassination of the i president many people on this site have referred to the country as a failed nation and asked what could’ve happened to bring them to this state. I think this is an ignorant position that makes light of history.

Haiti was a slave nation where people who were stolen from Africa were traded and made to work under threat of violence rape castration lynching and murder. When they orchestrated one of the first major successful slave rebellion, pushing back the French, and allowing for the Louisiana purchase to occur they were not only not welcomed into the rest of the world but brutally punished and forced to pay back “reparations” to the French. 

The enslaved people of Haiti were forced to pay money to the people who killed, raped, and enslaved them and this debt was not paid off for 122 years. Under threat of warship they were told to pay back more than 10x the cost of the Louisiana purchase. The equivalent of 20-30 billion dollars.

Thomas jefferson worked to isolate Haiti diplomatically and strangle it economically, fearing that the success of Haiti would inspire slave revolts back home. Haitian success was perceived as a threat to slavery in America for decades, and the United States didn't officially recognize Haiti until 1862, as slavery began being abolished.

The United States  worked to isolate a newly independent Haiti during the early 19th century and violently occupied the island nation for 19 years in the early 20th century. While the U.S. officially left Haiti in 1934, it continued to control Haiti's public finances until 1947, siphoning away around 40% of Haiti's national income to service debt repayments to the U.S. and France.

This means that while other countries were taking advantage of the various and exponentially quick technological revolutions, Haiti was trying to pay its way out of a fictional and racist debt “owed” to slave holders at gunpoint. 

If you add on the effects of natural disasters and the earthquake as well as the fact their president was murdered by foreign mercenaries. It makes sense that they would be in this position, and they deserve empathy not the designation of a failed state.

1gac58g,CMV: Censorship within /r/WorldNews is dangerous,"/r/WorldNews is the largest subreddit on reddit, and controlling the narrative with permabans for widely supported views is dangerous and promotes a one sided story. It creates a self perpetuating echo chamber. 

I was permabanned instantly for saying that Israel is enforcing an apartheid. Something many extensive United Nations reports have concluded, along with the top respected humanitarian aid organizations, and the government of the country for whom the word was literally invented, South Africa. 

Being instantly permabanned for just agreeing and sharing a view with these organizations undermines any credibility for the largest subreddit, yet they are the dominant voice for international news on reddit. 

Whether you agree that for example Israel is upholding an apartheid is not the issue, it is the complete lockdown on what is able to be discussed on that subreddit.

1gehf05,CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries,"Before saying anything else, I'm going to tell you that most of my viewpoints are based on empirical evidence that I and those around me have collected over the past years and not on looking deeper into muslim culture and reading the Qu'ran, which I'm planing to do at a later point.

I live in Germany, in a city that has both a very large support for homosexuality and the lgbtq community, as well as a large amount of muslims. An overwhelmingly large amount of the muslims I met in my life have increadibly aggressive views on especially the lbtq-community and jewish people, constantly using their religion as reasoning for their hatred. I know that this problem isn't exclusive to Islam, but christians tend to have a much less aggressive approach to these topics because of principles like charity and taking a hit to the other cheek. Muslims on the other hand oftenly take a much more aggressive approach, presumably because of their principles of an eye for an eye and the high importance of the jihad. 

Furthermore, people from muslim countries tend to be harder to immigrate than almost all other cultures, because of their (depending on the school) strict religious legislation on the behavior of women, going as far as women not being allowed to talk to any people outside, leading to generations of people not even learning our language and never socialising with the native germans at all, in spite of many (free) possibilities to do so. Many also oppose the legitimacy of a secular state and even oppose democracy in general, because it doesn't follow the ruling of their religion, which emphasizes that only muslim scholars should rule the state. 

While I tried to stay open to most cultures throughout my life, I feel like muslims especially attempt to never comprimise with other cultures and political systems. Not based on statistics, but simply my own experience in clubs and bars in cologne (the city I live in), the vast majority of fights I've seen happen, have been started by turkish or arab people. I've seen lots of domestic violence in muslim families too and parents straight up abondening and abusing their children if they turned out to be homosexual or didn't follow religious rulings.

I know that this problem isn't exclusive to Islam, but barely any other culture is so fierce about their views. I'm having a hard time accepting and not opposing them on that premise.

Nonetheless, I feel like generalization is rarely a good view to have, so I hope some of you can give me some insight. Is it really the culture, or did I just meet the wrong people?",RetepExplainsJokes,1890,800,0.75,0.3297834863887621,1730160592,/r/changemyview/comments/1gehf05/cmv_muslims_and_the_quran_itself_have_too_many/,2024,10
1fzrumy,CMV: The UN resolution calling for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories in 12 months shows the UN has no real interest in peace,"Just to preface: I'm an Israeli, I fully believe that a two state solution is the only way for peace and that eventually Israel will have to withdraw from the west bank.

Last month the UN general assembly passed a resolution calling for the complete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories in 12 months, among other things. This is obviously completely impossible for 2 main reasons -

1. Currently there are around 700K Israelis living in the west bank and transfering all of them out of there in a year is simply not doable. It's not like Israel has cities, houses and jobs ready to accommodate these people. The toll such a massive transfer of civilians would take on the economy and probably military is just too high for such a move to be realistic.

2. Israel cannot withdraw from the west bank before it is stable enough to not be threat to Israeli security. Pulling the army out of the west bank would leave Israel's heartland completely exposed to attacks from militants within the territory, something Israel simply can't allow to happen as it would majorly compromise the country's security. This is obviously the main reason why such a hasty, one sided withdrawal is impossible. 

This makes this resolution, in my opinion, detrimental to peace and not the opposite. 

This is because it's a resolution that Israel simply cannot accept. The consequences of this will be that many around the world and in Palestine will have the idea that Israel continuously ignores UN resolutions reinforced and Israel will garner even more hate for it. And in Israel it feeds straight into the ""UN and everyone is anti - semitic and can't be trusted"" narrative, which only strengths and emboldens the nationalists and drives people away from peace. 
I also thinks this leads the the UN becoming less credible as what's it's point if it is pushing out unrealistic resolutions? 

In my opinion if the UN truely cared about achieving peace they would adopt a resolution calling for Israel and the PA to restart earnest talks about adopting a 2 state solution, and the fact they instead adopted this one shows their interest isn't peace, but rather virtue signaling and optics. 

Now I know some might say that the UN general assembly resolutions are non binding and it's more about sending a message and reinforcing international law, but I would still say that sending an unrealistic message is useless and causes more harm than good.

1ftufds,"CMV: CMV: Within legally recognized marriages, adultery should have clear, civil legal consequences, unless expressly agreed between spouses.","The legal concept of marriage, where spouses act as partners, is almost always built on mutual trust that certain aspects of the relationship, such as sex, are to be exclusive to the relationship unless agreed upon otherwise. Legally and financially rewarding spouses for betraying the trust of their spouse by allowing a cheating spouse to come out ahead in divorce undermines one of the key relationship dynamics in our society.

For the vast majority of people, entering into marriage is an explicit agreement that unless divorced or otherwise agreed upon, the people in the marriage will not have sex with or develop romantic relationships with other people. This should apply evenly to all genders, and if you view this as benefitting one over the other, it says a lot about your view on who may or may not be more likely to cheat.

Before I'm accused of being some kind of conservative or traditionalist: I have zero issue with any form of LGBTQ+ relationship or poly setup. I'm speaking strictly to traditional, legally recognized, monogamous marriages, which comprise the bulk of those in our society. I'm also not religious or socially conservative.

Heading off a few arguments:

1. ""The government shouldn't be involved in marriage""

Too late for that. Marriage is a legally binding agreement that affects debt, assets, legal liability, taxes, homebuying, and other fundamental aspects of our lives. The end of marriage has profound, legally enforceable consequences on both parties. It is also included in a pre-existing legal doctrine of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation\_of\_affections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affections).

2) ""But what if the spouses want to open their marriage?""

Totally fine. My post is in reference to the most common form of marriage, which is monogamous.

3) ""Adultery doesn't have a clear definition""

It does. ""voluntary sexual [intercourse](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=05826a3c56c67289&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1127US1127&q=intercourse&si=ACC90nwZrNcJVJVL0KSmGGq5Ka2Y_LZNCuz-rXf3RWbWGZD0YFuvQ0gck8iv_I-vXEsPMmDpeldPlTyUN0FJ6k9nx2_KAjj_QmEabPxsAQcdvs4E9R8NkyU%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_k-r92u2IAxVAMdAFHaqNGncQyecJegQIOhAO) between a married person and a person who is not his or her spouse."" ""Sexual intercourse"" would include all the commonly recognized forms of sex. This would have to be proven via the typical preponderance standard, which is greater than 50% odds, via typical evidence used to evidence behaviors - depositions/testimony under oath, any written or photographic evidence, circumstantial evidence, etc.

4) ""What should the legal consequences be?""

At the very least, immediate forfeiture of any rights to alimony or spousal support. Shifts in the default assumption of a 50/50 split of marital assets are another route to explore. Certainly not enough to leave anyone destitute, though.

5) ""What about children?""

Child support is a separate issue, as it affects the child, who has no say in one of their parents cheating on the other.",insect_ligaments,654,1145,0.6800000071525574,0.3000201815549924,1727805246,/r/changemyview/comments/1ftufds/cmv_cmv_within_legally_recognized_marriages/,2024,10
1g4khwz,CMV: The Israeli government and army are truly behaving like monsters right now,"Sources from the BBC state that there have been 3 hospitals bombed in the last couple of months, as well as schools being targeted in Gaza. A house has been struck with mainly women and children killed. 

There has even been (yet unverified) reports of a man being burnt alive due to a fire caused by secondary explosions and no evidence of any close by Hamas base. Even doctors without borders has verified this.

In Lebanon, buildings with babies and children are being destroyed and countless innocent lives are lost.

In the guardian, there have been reported of a 'very relaxed' approach to specific targeting - in order to bomb an area with a suspected low level Hamas operative, an exceptionally high level of 'collateral damage' is permitted. This is far different to Israel's previous strategies.

There have been, of course, many terrorists who have been killed. However, I do not believe this justifies the enormous amount of civilian casualties. If anything, this will achieve the opposite of their goals - any Gazan or Lebanese, after seeing their loved ones killed, will be radicalised against Israel even more.

Even the US, Israel's biggest ally, has been alarmed by the amount of aid being restricted in Israel and has even threatened to suspend some arms sales. The situation looks really bad, and it is becoming increasingly harder to be able to even attempt to justify Israels options.

1fz6425,CMV: Presidential Debates should have LIVE Fact Checking,"I think that truth has played a significant role in the current political climate, especially with the amount of 'fake news' and lies entering the media sphere. Last month, I watched President Trump and Vice President Harris debate and was shocked at the comments made by the former president.

For example, I knew that there were no states allowing for termination of pregnancies after 9 months, and that there were no Haitian Immigrants eating dogs in Springfield Ohio, but the fact that it was it was presented and has since claimed so much attention is scary. The moderators thankfully stepped in and fact checked these claims, but they were out there doing damage.

In the most recent VP Debate between Walz and Vance, no fact checking was a requirement made by the republican party, and Vance even jumped on the moderators for fact checking his claims, which begs the question, would having LIVE fact checking of our presidential debates be such a bad thing? Wouldn't it be better to make sure that wild claims made on the campaign trail not hold the value as facts in these debates?

I am looking for the pros/cons of requiring the moderators to maintain a sense of honesty among our political candidates(As far as that is possible lol), and fact check their claims to provide viewers with an informative understanding of their choices.

They are mistaken. ,"Two years ago in the UK, a new front in the culture wars opened up when large posters exclaiming [""Hey straight white men; pass the power!""](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYiLQixX0AEUK03?format=jpg&name=900x900) were spotted in various locations around its cities, as part of a taxpayer funded outdoor arts exhibition ran by an organisation by the name of 'Artichoke' - a vaguely progressive body aimed at making art more accessible to the public at large.

Evidently, the art was designed to generate discussion, and due to its front page news level controversy, on that level at least it was an astounding success: with the intended message clearly being that 'straight white men' have too much power, and they need to hand it over to people who are not 'straight white men', in order to, according to Artichoke's own mission statement at least, ""Change the world for the better"". 

Now this kind of sentiment - that 'straight white men' (however they are defined) are currently in power, and they need to step aside and let 'other people' (again, however they are defined) run the show for a while - is one that seems, to my mind at least, alarmingly common in liberal circles. 

See for example [this article](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lily-allens-right-white-males-9562356#ICID=sharebar_twitter), which among other things,  claims:

\>""It's white men who run the world. It's white men who prosecute the crimes, hand down the jail sentences, [decide how little to pay female staff,](http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/women-20s-paid-less-men-9560167) and tell the lies that keep everybody else blaming each other for the world's problems""

\>""It's white males, worldwide, who are causing themselves and the rest of the planet the most problems. It was white males over 45 with an income of $100,000 or more who [voted for tiny-fingered Donald Trump to run the free world](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-followed-emergency-kittens-9549099)""

Before finally concluding:

\>""Let me ask you this: if all the statistics show you're running the world, and all the evidence shows you're not running it very well, how long do you think you'll be in the job? If all the white men who aren't sex offenders tried being a little less idiotic, the world would be a much better place"".

And this, at last, brings us to the crux of my issue with such thinking. Because to the kinds of liberals who make these arguments - that it's white men who run the world, and are causing everyone else all the problems - could you please explain to me:

How many straight white men currently sit among the ranks of the Taliban, who don't merely decide ""How little to pay female staff"", but [simply ban them from working entirely,](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-07-07/an-afghan-woman-wanted-to-be-a-doctor-now-she-makes-pickles-as-the-taliban-restricts-womens-roles) among [various](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/26/taliban-bar-on-afghan-women-speaking-in-public-un-afghanistan) [other](https://amu.tv/129066/) [restrictions](https://medicamondiale.org/en/where-we-empower-women/afghanistan) ? 

How many straight white men currently govern countries such as Pakistan, Iran, and Thailand, where the kinds of crimes prosecuted involve [blasphemy (which carries the death penalty), ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68511557) [not wearing the hijab (which again, basically carries the death penalty)](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/16/iranian-woman-dies-after-being-beaten-by-morality-police-over-hijab-law), and [criticising the monarchy (no death penalty at least, but still 15 years in prison)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/thailands-lese-majesty-laws-explained-in-30-seconds#:~:text=Under%20article%20112%20of%20the,majesty%20%E2%80%93%20anywhere%20in%20the%20world) ? 

Or how many straight white men were responsible for ""blaming someone else"" for the problems of any of those [various countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_cleansing_campaigns#2000s) in which acts of ethnic cleansing have taken place, on the orders of governments in which not a straight white man sat? 

Indeed, the article preaches against the thousands of white men who voted for Trump -  ignoring the fact that more [Indians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_2019_Indian_general_election)voted for Modi's [far right](https://jacobin.com/2024/03/bjp-far-right-modi-india) BJP, than there are white men in America \*at all\*!

Now; again, I must stress. NONE of the above is to say that straight white men have never restricted the rights of women, passed overbearing laws, or persecuted minorities. Of course they have; but surely it is more than enough evidence to show that NONE of those behaviours are exclusive to straight white men, and so simply demanding straight white men step down and ""Pass the power!"" is no guarantee of a progressive utopia-  when so many countries not run by straight white men are \*far\* from such? Moreover; does it not also suggest that ideology is NOT dictated by race, and therefore asserting that we can judge how progressive -or regressive- one's politics are simply by skin tone is ludicrous? 

Indeed, the whole idea that 'straight white men' exisit as a political collective at all seems frankly baffling to me; many liberals ironically seem to know the difference between Bernie Sanders/Jeremy Corbyn and Donald Trump/Boris Johnson (delete as nationally applicable) very well, and if straight white men do act in such a collevtive spirit, as liberals often allege, then how in high heaven did England have a series of [vicious civil wars, driven in part by religious sectarianism,](https://www.britannica.com/event/English-Civil-Wars) at a time when nearly every politician in the country was straight, white and male?!

Indeed; while we're back with the UK - even if all such people did step down, and hand over their power, we would still find a great deal of conservatism in the ranks of our politics; we may even find non white MPs standing up and demanding the [recriminalisation of homosexuality](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law), or even [persecution for apostasy.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34357047) Yes, many ethnic minorities are more likely to vote for ""progressive"" parties (Labour in the UK, the Democrats in the US), but this clearly does not translate to political progressivism on their own individual part. 

Now, a counter argument to my view here may be; ""But are you not cherry-picking the worst examples? Why do you not look at those non-white societies which, presently or historically, have been more progressive?"".

And I concede; ancient India may have been more accepting of homosexuality and gender fluidity than was the norm in (white) Europe - as were several Native American nations. But this too ignores the fact that, as today, non white societies in the past also ran on a spectrum of progressive to conservative: certain Native American societies might well have been gender egalitarian, even matriarchies - but many of the Confucian states in East Asia (particularly China) were perhaps even more patriarchal than was the norm in Europe. Indeed, they were certainly as apt at [warfare](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/atrocity-and-genocide-in-japans-invasion-of-korea-15921598/7EFEAB40BC9D61D2F9E92CF8C506FB70), [genocide, ](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/qing-extermination-of-the-zunghars/6D038CADD0F808459451175C1CAD6DC5)and [ethnic persecution.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/viet-nam-and-the-genocide-of-champa-14701509/6E8490A4C5670883A94DAD24BF5C899A)

All of which is to say, finally reaching my conclusion, in which (I hope!), I have effectively stated my case:

History, foreign politics, and even the attitudes of minorities within 'white' majority countries all suggest that there is no correlation between skin tone and political belief - and it is FAR MORE important to listen to what people actually believe, rather than lazily assume ""Oh, you have X skin tone, therefore you must believe Y, and surrender your power to Z who will make the world a better place than you"". 

Again, the argument I am making here is NOT that there should be \*only\* straight white men in politics, or that non white men are inherently \*worse\* at politics - I am well aware that there are many extremely progressive POC, as there are many extremely progressive white men. 

Rather, I argue exactly the opposite; that liberal identity essentialism is entirely in the wrong, and no one group of people are any inherently more progressive or conservative than any other - thus, simply removing one group from power is no guarantee of achieving progressive causes. 

I stand of course to be proven incorrect; and will adjust my view as your thoughts come in!",TenTonneTamerlane,1156,792,0.7300000190734863,0.2665242227138733,1730040057,/r/changemyview/comments/1gdcgv6/cmv_certain_sects_of_liberals_believe_that_simply/,2024,10
1g5y5nf,CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters ,"I was inspired to write this by an exchange I had regarding this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/s/E2Mj2dgkA8. As you can see the OP made a big hit. Over 1000 upvotes at the time I write this.

But take a second to consider the implications of that meme: it suggests that there are only two groups that exist in the American electorate —people who have decided to vote for Harris, and MAGA authoritarians. That’s it.

Now, I realize this was just a silly bit of fun, but I raised a question to other users on that heavily Democratic-leaning sub: is it wise to shame and ridicule people who still might vote for Kamala, especially considering that the election will almost certainly be decided by a extremely narrow segment  of the electorate? Does it make sense to mock undecided voters under these circumstances?

My concerns were met with scorn.

“I’m tired of swing voters! If they can’t figure out who to vote for, they should just stay home!”, said one.

“Swing voters don’t actually exist. They know they’re going to vote for Trump and just pretend to be undecided for attention.”, claimed another.

“I would hate to deny a person their right to vote but if a person can’t figure out why voting for Trump is bad…”

I am paraphrasing here, but only a little. What’s worse, I hear similar ideas from my progressive friends and I believe these opinions are common in left-of-center circles.

For example there was a post not too long ago right here on this sub where the OP expressed concern that Harris was not getting enough support from labor unions. I commented that the Democrats are increasingly becoming the party of the university educated managerial class and that they are losing wage earning workers in the process and I suggested that this was lamentable. Lots of people responded that the working class is mostly composed of bigots anyway so progressives shouldn’t seek their votes at all.

Now, that point of view is totally unhinged for a variety of reasons but I do want to say that I get why people are frustrated with swing voters.

Like, how can you be “not sure” about voting for or against a convicted criminal with authoritarian tendencies who endorses dictators and threatens civil rights? What kind of person would struggle with that decision?

But getting impatient is still not the appropriate response because despite what some Reddit users may believe swing voters are real.

There are people who voted for Obama, then Trump and then Biden and who have not made their mind yet about the 2024 election at this time. The key point for me is no matter how exasperating this kind of behavior might be, we need to try to coax these people to vote for our candidate and cannot afford to scoff at them publicly.

Statistically, swing voters are less educated and less politically engaged than hardcore supporters of either party, but they will decide the election. If a person does not want another Trump presidency, it is necessary to appeal to undecided voters. There simply aren’t enough Subaru Outback-driving, NPR-listening progressives (describing myself here) in the country—or in swing states—to carry the day for Kamala alone.

And like it or not, fair or not, there does exist a perception that Democrats are elitist college students and professors with nothing but sneering contempt for those without higher education. We can count on Trump and the Republicans to exploit that feeling to their advantage.

Making posts like the I referenced above exacerbates the problem. Even if it is at a micro level, the sentiment that undecided voters are stupid is widely spread and widely disseminated in progressive circles. And perception and feelings are more important than policy or facts right now, particularly for those “low information” voters who are going to decide whether or not Trump goes back to the Oval Office.

Under these conditions, I think a little tolerance and goodwill toward undecided voters makes strategic sense right now and I’m speaking to all of us who plan to vote for Kamala Harris.

Or maybe I’m wrong. Does it make sense to be openly scornful of swing voters right now?

I just want to say off the bat. Responses that say something to effect of, “What the Republicans do is even worse!” will not change my view. I don’t want the GOP to win so if they shoot themselves in the foot, I’m happy.

And if you do support Trump, I’m glad for you. I don’t. We can discuss him somewhere else.",BluePillUprising,568,1010,0.7099999785423279,0.2639011233082237,1729190685,/r/changemyview/comments/1g5y5nf/cmv_it_is_unwise_for_supporters_of_kamala_harris/,2024,10

I cannot disagree more. Its the lack of actual diversity thats hurting the industry. Real diversity is arguments, different view points, tension, and showing that were different. Take Dragon Age: Origins. In that game it shows how elves are considered second class citizens to humans and the discrimination they face. That is diversity that builds to the lore and feels human, because diversity shouldn't be ""everyone gets along"". It should be ""even if we are completely different and im supposed to hate you we can still be friends."" It should be that we can have different view points yet still all work together.

1gdi4gm,CMV: Allowing children to become morbidly obese is child abuse. ,"As the title states, parents that allow their children to become morbidly obese are abusing them and should be treated as abusive parents. That includes CPS involvement and possibly loss of custody. 

In regards to the type of abuse, I believe that allowing a child to be some obese falls under “neglect.” Neglect occurs when a person responsible for the care of another person does not provide needed care or leaves them without care. In this instance, the parents are not providing the needed care, which I believe is a healthy diet/exercise regiment needed to maintain a healthy weight. 


While I think that enabling obesity could also be categorized as physical abuse because it causes bodily injures, I think that this falls short of the definition of physical abuse because there is a lack of direct physical contact by the abuser. With that said, I am open to a different opinion on this point as it could be argued that the physical symptoms of allowing a child to become obese is still physical abuse even if the abuser doesn’t inflict the injury with direct bodily contact. 

So how should this abuse be addressed by officials? First, CPS should be involved and allowed to investigate the reasons behind a child’s morbid obesity. If it does result from neglect, then the parents should have to work with professionals to address the issue. The cost of this care would be dependent upon the families financial situation. Failure to do so, and or failure to improve the child’s weight would result in a loss of custody. 

Maybe this is just crazy? Change my view.

1g5z1za,CMV: Trump supporters are largely delusional,"The MAGA campaign of recent years has appeared to me as increasingly cultish, with supporters seeing Trump as more of a God like figure, as an omnibenevolent figure in a world of lies constantly being fought through illegal means by the Democrats with little to no evidence, even circumstantial.

However, the way I see it is that the Trump campaign is built from a basis of lies and deception, from the blatant such as the Capitol riot and not conceding the 2020 election results to the more subtle such as the consistent talk of how loved he is around the world. Supporters seem to just believe every word out of his mouth, reading biased newspapers and dismissing all criticisms of Trump (while I accept some are false or blown out of proportion, a dismissal of all indicates a lack of critical thinking about who they support). 

In addition to this, the belief that Trump will not follow through even in small part with the Project 2025 plan also seems at least to me as deeply flawed thinking, with many leading Republicans of his previous presidency co-writing the incredibly detailed and controversial paper on a term Trump would serve, and with his clear desire for increased power through the appointment of Republicans to positions such as the supreme court (also based in part from his previous presidency). This flawed thinking stands out to me in particular in regards to Project 2025 due to its staunchly anti-abortion viewpoint, a view which [85%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/08/20/how-americans-really-feel-about-abortion-the-sometimes-surprising-poll-results-as-dnc-gets-underway/) of American adults disagree with (some more conservative estimates place this figure at [65%](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-trump-biden-election-2024-dobbs-498d14f6e2bbfe1f313f006ad089de4e)). This sweeping majority disagreeing with such a major part of the plan yet still supporting Trump shows blatant delusion and lack of research into the candidate of their choosing. In addition to this, when polled on Project 2025 just [7%](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-project-2025-broadly-known-severely-unpopular-voters-rcna172660) of Republicans say they feel positively about the plan. 

  
So all in all, I have trouble understanding what goes on inside Trump supporters heads, with the constant lies told (I understand that the Democrats also lie, but Trump is on a different scale), cultish behaviour and lack of research and critical thinking into the candidate who may run the most powerful economy of the world in an increasingly dangerous time, defunding NATO, banning abortion and destabilising the government whilst being incredibly unpopular in all other countries.",jkgill69,58,1129,0.5299999713897705,0.24661921248125035,1729192971,/r/changemyview/comments/1g5z1za/cmv_trump_supporters_are_largely_delusional/,2024,10

1g5ebf6,CMV: States shouldn’t simultaneously have no-knock warrants and a castle doctrine,"No-knock warrants allow law enforcement to enter a property without prior notification (knocking or announcing their presence).

Castle doctrine laws give individuals the right to use force, including deadly force, to defend themselves in their home without the duty to retreat.

Many states have some nuance with these laws but a lot of states have an overlap where they allow both of these to simultaneously exist. Texas for example has both.

This post is NOT arguing for one or the other but rather the fact that they both shouldn’t coexist.

If they coexist, it introduces a potential deadly threat to both law enforcement and the person defending their home and bystanders. In a scenario where law-enforcement gets a no-knock warrant and attempts to go through, the person can defend their home to this unknown intruder. This can of course lead to a gun fight.

Maybe this is a popular opinion but the fact that 30+ states have this overlap is mind boggling.",bernful,1333,550,0.949999988079071,0.22954561695767728,1729124755,/r/changemyview/comments/1g5ebf6/cmv_states_shouldnt_simultaneously_have_noknock/,2024,10

It draws attention to other places where the wall of standard/expected Dem support is cracking.

1g9o244,CMV: An abortion ban will only create more human suffering,"Banning abortion is going to create a lot more suffering, especially for kids who end up in foster care. Right now, only about 20% of foster kids ever get adopted, which means the rest are stuck in the system until they either go back to their biological families or age out at 18. For the 20% who age out without a permanent family, life gets really tough. About 50% end up addicted to drugs, and 1 in 5 becomes homeless. For the boys, more than half end up in jail, and for the girls, about 70% are pregnant by age 21.

That’s a huge problem, and banning abortion is only going to flood the foster care system with more kids, which is already struggling to keep up. The system’s broken, and we know that kids who grow up in foster care are way more likely to end up in trouble—about 80% of people in prison spent time in foster care as kids.

So really, banning abortion isn’t just about babies being born—it’s about putting more kids into a system that can’t handle them and setting them up for a hard life. If we care about reducing suffering, pushing more kids into foster care is only going to lead to more addiction, crime, and pain for everyone.",AmbassadorFar4335,595,726,0.75,0.20535137990484506,1729618719,/r/changemyview/comments/1g9o244/cmv_an_abortion_ban_will_only_create_more_human/,2024,10

I think the key word there is *inappropriate*. If someone is mocking or making fun of another culture, that’s cultural appropriation. But I don’t see anything wrong with adopting the practices of another culture because you genuinely enjoy them.

The argument seems to be that, because *X* people were historically oppressed for this hairstyle, you cannot wear it because it’s unfair.

And I completely understand that it IS unfair. I hate that it’s unfair, but it is. However, unfair doesn’t translate to being offensive.

It’s not too far off to imagine an autocratic term if Trump wins.

He has admitted that if Christians vote for him, they won’t have to do it again. 

You can try to downplay what Trump says as much as you want, but the truth is, he already tried to diminish our democracy, and he will do it again, he already said he won’t concede.

Here’s what at risk:

1. Mass deportation, including people from muslim countries and Palestinian refugees. This includes getting rid of birthright citizenship. And yes, this is anti constitutional, but Trump was given the power to commit literal crimes under the pretension of “official orders” with no consequences. Who is to say he won’t try to stay power any longer when his term is up?

Majority of people want to support abortion on a federal level, even republicans). With another Trump term, there is a chance he might appoint 3 more, for at least 30 years we could have a Republican majority in the Supreme court. With the 3 he already instated he was already able to find criminal immunity as a president and getting rid of abortion  as a right nationwide, who is to say he won’t try to do more?

3. If Jill Stein cared about Palestine, she wouldn’t try to take away votes from Kamala and she wouldn’t tell people “if you don’t vote for me, vote for Trump”. To Netanyahu, it is 100000x more convenient if Trump is president rather than Kamala, why is that? and if so, why would Jill Stein prefer someone who’s in bed with both a P*tin and Netanyahu? (not like she isn’t in bed with P*tin herself)

Aaron David Miller said: “He (Netanyahu) needs Donald Trump. And he needs the Republican Party. He's got to hedge his bets.”

4. Even if Jill Stein got “some” votes, the 5% thing is something that ONLY she pushes. There is no law that says that you need 5% to be a legitimate party, it’s a made up number to sabotage the election. She only shows up against female candidates to take votes from them, feels a but misogynistic and opportunistic if you ask me. If she actually cared about Palestine, she’d run small in local politics and tried to push change from there (like AOC does) this is more about her than it is about Palestine. 

5. If Trump wins, you might not get a chance to do anything for Palestine. 6 Supreme court judges appointed by Trump, cult following willing to do anything for this man, unwilling to accept the election results unless he wins (they’re already burning ballot boxes), unlimited power to do as he pleases under the notion of official acts, backed by Netanyahu and P*tin… realistically, either Trump or Kamala will win.

1gewuha,CMV: Dating preferences shouldn’t be considered wrong for people to have ,"This is mostly a social media thing but social media makes it’s way into real life. I’ve noticed over the years people have been against certain preferences, and to me I don’t see a problem with having preferences in your dating life. As long as you aren’t saying people who aren’t your preference are objectively less than, and we can admit that everyone has their own taste. I’ve seen people say if you wouldn’t date someone at all it’s a requirement not a preference, and to that I do agree but preference is kind of a euphemism many times in this case

But if someone only dates white people, let them who cares. It doesn’t affect anyone else, as long as they don’t shit on other races. If someone doesn’t wanna date fat people, then so what? As long as they aren’t insulting people who cares? If someone doesn’t wanna date a person with a high body count or who is a SW, as long as they don’t talk down on those people. I may only like chocolate icecream and never eat vanilla, but that doesn’t mean I’m going around hating vanilla it means I wouldn’t eat it myself.

Also I see a lot of people have an issue with this because they view it as a prejudice, and in a way dating is inherently predjudice but people feel like it shouldn’t be towards things someone can’t change. But this obviously isn’t the case. Plenty of people say they want a “smart” partner, but people can’t change their IQ. If you want a partner with similar interests to you is that fair if someone can’t control what’s interesting to them or not? Dating is inherently judging someone to see if they meet your standards of dating and there’s nothing wrong with that as long as your judgements don’t go past would I personally want to be in a intimate relationship with this person.",Accomplished-Fix1204,314,761,0.6899999976158142,0.1892840611321565,1730214400,/r/changemyview/comments/1gewuha/cmv_dating_preferences_shouldnt_be_considered/,2024,10

We're reaching a tipping point where either homes become completely uninsurable or the insurance becomes so expensive that homes start losing value. 

This will precipitate a death spiral, where homeowners start to realize that buying or owning a home in Florida is not a good investment and they'll leave the state. Supply will increase as demand falls. 

I will add one caveat here and it's that the federal government could step in and rescue Florida through a subsidized insurance scheme, but the politics of this are really iffy. Republicans would be most incentivized to save the state, but such intervention is also against Republican orthodoxy.

1g9zjx6,CMV: Women who require men to pay/support them when dating are inherently going against feminism and equality movement and is extremely harmful to dating culture,"As the title states, I believe women that require the men to pay for them if they want to be in a relationship are inherently against the equal rights movement for women. I want to first clarify what I mean by ""paying for them"". A large notion of dating culture is that men are supposed to pay for dates, rents, bills, and financially support the women in order to be seen as a romantic partner and a real man. This belief directly goes against the idea of equal rights between genders as it infantilizes women. It also feeds into the stigma held by men against all forms of feminism that women only want equal rights when it benefits them as they want to have all the positive aspects of an equal relationship while also having the upside of having your entire life financed by your partner. I also believe that it is hypocritical to believe that you are in an equal relationship if you are being completely supported by your male partner. This belief also severely impacts dating for any men who are not in a financial state to be fully paying for another person. For example any low income groups, college students. It basically makes it seem like you have to be rich enough to ""buy"" a date and a relationship. I have heard the counter argument that feminism is about being able to choose to be in this type of relationship. Before I address this I want to be clear, if you want to be in a trad relationship, go for it, however you both people have to take the traditional roles. However, choosing to be financially supported while being in an equal rights relationship and while having your own career is essentially infantilizing yourself in the relationship. You are basically stating you want a ""father"" not a partner. This is the same version as men who make their partner do all the housework while the wife also has a career. In summary, I believe that women who want to be in a modern and equal relationship while having the men to support you financially are hypocrites. An equal relationship is one that splits finances, housework, and all other aspects of the relationship according to what makes sense to that relationship. This unequal relationship causes a lot of negative effects to overall dating culture",lordamir008,392,669,0.6800000071525574,0.1761241790470212,1729649376,/r/changemyview/comments/1g9zjx6/cmv_women_who_require_men_to_paysupport_them_when/,2024,10
1gangu3,CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party,"The word ""fascism"" gets thrown around as a slur nowadays, but it was a mainstream, popular movement for a good chunk of the last century. 

* Donald Trump's former chief of staff (Mark Kelly), along with the highest-ranked military officer who served under Trump (Mark Milley), have both said on-record that the leader of the Republican party [is a fascist](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-kelly-swinging-trump/story?id=115061457).
* A leading historian of fascism, [Robert Paxton](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/magazine/robert-paxton-facism.html) (paywall, sorry), recently adopted this view and said it goes beyond the party's leader: ""It's bubbling up from below in very worrisome ways, and that's very much like the original fascisms. It's the real thing. It really is.""
* Umberto Eco, who lived in fascist Spain, defined ""[Ur-Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur-Fascism)"" in a 1995 essay as a collection of attributes that pretty much match the modern Republican party. 

I don't personally know anyone who *self-identifies* as ""fascist"" in real life. But they are not hard to find on the internet. If you go to the largest neo-nazi site on the internet, which I won't link to for obvious reasons, you will see news stories that mostly resemble mainstream Republican talking points about how immigrants and Democrats are ruining America. While some self-identified fascists are sitting out the election, most seem to be voting Republican (and as far as I can tell exactly zero are voting for Democrats). 

One big difference seems to be that the Republican party isn't antisemitic while most self-identified fascists are.

1g0rxgr,"CMV: Iran is not the greatest adversary of the United States, and saying so is a pretty brazen absurdity that demonstrates Israel's outsized influence on the country.","Iran being the ""greatest"" enemy of the United States was a statement Kamala Harris made to the press when asked about who the United States greatest adversary was, for some context, but its a statement that could just as easily of come from a Republican's mouth. 

Russia and China both have stronger militaries and stronger espionage capabilities that are currently in use in the United States. Russia in particular has strong influence over US elections in a way that Iran just doesn't. Russia's attack of Ukraine is also more of an existential threat to the West and the United States alliances and strategic interests, but China's threat to Taiwan is also important, and even a conventional war with China would be disastrous for all parties involved. 

Iran doesn't have these kinds of capabilities, and is in part propped up by Russia, so even if we pretended that the US' most vital interests were in the Middle East (Which they aren't, and both Biden and Obama has wanted to get out of the region and refocus towards Asia), Iran is still largely a Russia proxy, indicating that the real threat is Russia. Iran has less than a fourth of the GDP of Russia and around half the population. Iranian proxies limited to the region, whereas Russia has proxies all around the globe and their influence extends into South America, putting them far more into the US' sphere of influence. What Iran is, is the greatest adversary of Israel, as it and its proxies operates primarily within Israel's sphere of influence while having a solely negative relationship with Israel (Whereas Russia, Iran's backer, has a more complicated relationship with Israel where they are not adversaries).

1fuof4o,"CMV: Piracy isn't immoral, Nor is the damage from it as big as people make it out to be.","- ""If buying isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing.""

We've all heard this phrase countless times, and that's what i wanna dive into here. Companies have been and continue to get greedier by the second, and they've started to completely disregard people's conditions when it comes to acquiring a product. Streaming services deliberately serve you ads on their lower tier subscriptions in order to get you to upgrade (giving ads to paying customers is ridiculous), certain game stores have shit regional pricing or don't have it at all, game companies continue to include DRM software that damages the experience of the paying customers (cough cough, denuvo) and completely fucks up the experience of paying customers. Let's not even get into Nintendo and their abuse of the copyright system, i'll leave it for another post.

Not only is piracy these days not immoral, its actually the only way some people can acquire something they want to consume because they don't have a choice. So one could argue it ends up reaching people that would've otherwise just not consumed the product: You're not getting someone who can't buy a product to buy a product. But through pirating it they may become a potential customer. But lets digress a little.

So you, yeah, the person reading the post. Lets say you wanted to buy a game. Perhaps you'd use an online game store like epic games or steam, right? Now you own the game, and you can play it. Simple and convenient right? Except you don't own the game. If you, for any reason, get banned from the platform or lose access to your account you'll end up with either one of two things: an excruciating headache from trying to get it back or no games at all. Oh, you say you're a paying customer and you acquired everything legally? Sucks to be you! (You're also subject to the service's longevity, ToS changes, bugs, online authentication, bullshit DRM integration... I mean at least take me out to dinner before you f-- me like that-)

...Nah, for real though. The difference between getting games these days and lets say, 20 years ago, is that you actually owned the game physically. Unless you were using your CDs to cut bananas or something, you just need the game console and the CD. Nowadays you basically need to have everything online and completely depend on the company and be subject to their online authentication for various games before you can actually play them. Again, making the life of paying customers harder for no reason. 

If these companies are extremely rich and they keep buying out or getting rid of competition (cough cough nintendo), keep flipping the bird to the customers and push us to do exactly what they want once they've monopolized the market, how is piracy immoral? Doing anything about injustices legally will get you slapped around by big time lawyers and legal fees, so it is quite literally the only way that we have to rebel against these companies and make them change the way they behave. Your support ticket #2131321 is not changing shit, but speaking with your wallet surely will, especially if more people do it. Piracy isn't immoral, and it is purely a service issue. Its born out of the greed of streaming services and game companies. I guarantee it'd drop by an astounding 99% if they were to just fix the fucking way they operate, but they refuse to. So i say, sail the high seas and find that One Piece! Okay i need to stop... but anyways, change my view if there's something im missing here.

I don't even want to discuss the answer because it has been discussed to death already and everybody has come to their own conclusions about it at some point of another. 

I'm just thinking about the point of the debate in the first place. From my understanding, it was to raise awareness about how unsafe women feel around men in general and that men need to collectively understand this and do better. 

Men though, aren't a monolith. I can't force a horrible person to stop doing doing horrible things and the average man can't either. We can work towards addressing subtle sexism, evaluating the kind of jokes we make and language we use to make everyone around us feel as safe as possible but topics like SA are very unlikely to come up in a normal conversation in a way that we can simply talk the 1% of men who do these things out of doing them. I highly doubt these people are active in such online spaces and engaging in debates like these anyway.

As such, the only effect this argument has had is to make a chunk of normal men feel demonized for acts that they've never personally committed (men have feelings that get hurt at times, shocker I know) and can't do a whole lot about unless something like that is happening close enough for them to physically intervene.

1fxg8rf,CMV: Trump supporters are in a cult ,"I’ve been going back and forth for a long time wondering if his followers are actually in a cult or if they’re just a misguided bunch that will one day see the reality and find out that this guy doesn’t actually care about them or the country in which they live. But here recently after the things i’ve seen i think the first option is more likely. Id love for this not to be true because if it is i’m sad for my country, but i don’t know anymore.

The reasons i think they’re in a cult: 

-Their leader does no wrong. It doesn’t matter what crazy statements their candidate makes or how outlandish his actions/comments are, they take it as law. He’s 100% right, no questions asked, and anyone disagreeing with him or criticizing him is “brainwashed” and “drinking the kool aid” 

-Any news/media criticizing him is “fake news”. First it was the obvious. CNN, ABC, and MSNBC. They claim these are “fake news channels” “communist propoganda machines” “paid by democrats to smear trump” and bla bla bla. Even if there is video evidence to validate the criticism, they think it’s edited or taken out of context. 

- Trump is the only source of truth for them. Science says climate change is real? No it isn’t, because Trump said it’s a hoax. Trump has made several racist comments in the past? No! He isn’t racist because he says he isn’t. Kamala Harris has always been Indian AND black? Nope! Trump says she “turned black” one day, remember? They take anything he says as truth and ignore facts. 

- Anything he says, or does is 100% justified no matter how dangerous the rhetoric is.

Videos of police brutality, especially against African Americans, became viral, and millions became outraged that this was so common in America. When George Floyd was murdered, millions justifiably took to the streets to protest against police brutality and racism. Politicians came out in support for police reform, and discussions on how to reform policing (from “how to make the police better” to “defund the police”) were all the rage.

But from 2021, it seems like everything took a complete 180. Crime skyrocketed during COVID (in part of police refusing to do their jobs in protest of BLM), causing the average American to support the police a lot more. Pro-police politicians like Eric Adams were elected while pro-BLM politicians like Chelsea Boudin were ousted from their positions.

Now, absolutely nobody talks about police brutality these days, not politicians nor the general public. But has the problem gone away? No! It has only gotten worse! 2023 has seen a record number of killings by police, and I don’t expect that number to go down in the future.

I think Israel recognizes this, which is why it appears they're culling and dislocating as many Palestinians as they can and trying to get them all to move into Egypt so that when they annex Gaza; whoever is left will be a small and manageable minority.

Trump has claimed that the federal government is doing a horrible job with Hurricane Helene relief. My understanding is that republican senators and democratic governors of NC has basically said that that is totally not true and they are getting what they need, basically fully approving of the recovery effort.

The obvious counter argument is to say this is just politics but the fact that republican senators are contradicting Trump on this seems to remove the possibility that this is just partisan mudslinging and that Trump just doesn't care if what he says is true.

1g9xfik,CMV: The frequency of false rape accusations is an unknowable statistic,"A popular argument against addressing the issue of false rape (or sexual assault) accusations is that they are so exceedingly rare, that it isn't an issue worth dedicating significant resources to.  And that addressing the issue of rape and sexual assault is far more vital.

Various ""studies"" have been done to try to determine the rate of false accusations, and they typically conclude that somewhere in the range of 2% - 8% of accusations are false.  Some claim a lower number.  Others claim it is over 40%.

My view is that, because of the nature of the crime, it is simply impossible to get reliable data upon which to form a conclusion about the frequency of false accusation.  There will be some small percentage of accusations that can be proven (to a reasonable extent) to be true, and some small percentage of accusations that can be proven to be false.  And then you'll have a large percent - at least 80% to 90% - that fall somewhere in the middle and might be true, or might be false, but we don't really know to any reasonable extent.

In most accusations, there are only 2 people who know what *actually* happened and whether consent was granted, or even if sexual activity was engaged in.  If those 2 people's stories disagree on either of those factors - and they usually do - it is unlikely that we'll ever be able to reasonably conclude whether the accusation is accurate, or false.

The ones that could be concluded as true would include:

* Situations where video, audio, or eyewitness evidence of the actual act exists and shows that sex was had without consent.

* Situations where the 2 people's stories genuinely align, and the details of those stories indicate that a rape occurred, even though the accused doesn't think it should.

* Situations with significant physical evidence that indicates that both (a) sex was had, and (b) it is unlikely that consent was granted.  This would be rape of the ""stranger jumped out of the bushes and violently attacked"" variety.

The ones that could be reasonably concluded as false would include:

* Situations where video, audio, or eyewitness evidence shows that consent was provided for any sexual activity.

* Situations where the 2 people's stories genuinely align, and the details of those stories do not meet the legal definition of rape, even though the accuser thinks it should.

* Situations where the accuser recants their accusation, and there is reasonable evidence to support that recantation.  [Sometimes accusations are recanted because the accuser just doesn't want to deal with the situation anymore.  Recanting for that reason wouldn't be indicative of a false accusation].

There's probably a few other situations that could be definitively determined as true or false that I've missed.  But the overwhelming majority (80%+), are just going to be indeterminable.

On top of all that, there are additional factors that even further exacerbate the challenges of defining the frequency of false rape accusations:

* There isn't clear or consistent agreement on what counts as an ""accusation"".  Is it just criminal reports to police?  What about civil litigation without criminal prosecution?  How about Title IX reports to universities?  Or simply tell a friend group or social media that a rape happened?  At what point does it become an ""accusation"" that gets analyzed as true or false?

* There are inconsistent laws as to what legally qualifies as rape / sexual assault, and beyond the laws, there are discrepancies of whether the statistics are intended to represent just ""legal rape"", or ""moral rape"" as well - even if it doesn't meet the legal definition for rape.

*  If we're talking about ""moral rape"", people can and do disagree on what counts as rape and what counts as a false accusation.  In these cases, people could 100% agree on every detail of the accusation, but still disagree upon whether it was rape, or a false accusation.  For example, disagreement over where the line of ""too drunk to consent"" would be encompassed here.

For all these reasons, and definitive statement about a specific percentage of accusations that are true or false is simply unreliable.",JuicingPickle,137,546,0.6100000143051147,0.12840399451147888,1729643037,/r/changemyview/comments/1g9xfik/cmv_the_frequency_of_false_rape_accusations_is_an/,2024,10
1fvbizp,CMV: The reason the Iranian attack two days ago did not kill a single Israeli is not because Iran did not target civilians but because of Home Front Command guidelines and Anti-Missile defenses. ,"I've seen this take all over Reddit. I've even seen people claim that Israelis using the lack of casualties as proof the attack was unsuccessful as evidence the Israelis see success in warfare as the amount of damage caused to civilians. As well as conspiracy theories that the IDF is hiding the true amount of casualties. I think the evidence shows that the attack was meant to cause the maximum damage to military and civilians and failed due to the significant precautions the State of Israel has taken to protect its residents. 

Here's a broad rundown of events, this is basically a first hand account. An emergency alert was sent to phones across Israel and Israeli occupied territories before the attack and about a minute later once the rockets fired missile alarms sounded (except Eilat which is in the middle of nowhere). About 2 minutes later I could clearly hear loud explosions nearby which scared a dog that was sheltering with me. (So this was not targetted) About 40 minutes another emergency alert was sent that it was safe to leave the bunkers. I consider myself extremely lucky to be away from military targets, close to a bunker and under the protection of the Iron Dome. I understand that the West Bank and Lebanon do not and that Gaza is actually designed to put the maximum amount of civilians in harms way. Even a lot of Israelis don't have sufficient access to bunkers or safe rooms. Especially in the periphery where they need it the most. 

Of course we all know that Israeli air defenses were overwhelmed in the attack. That was not only known, but expected. Which is why bunkers and sirens are also used, and Israelis are well aware of the guidelines due to the dozens of drills we had to take during our life. There is this thing called the Swiss cheese model of risk management. None of the precautions alone could have protected the country 100% but together they ""cover each others holes"". Missile defenses create a lot of shrapnel which can be deadly. Bunkers can be poorly made or even locked or unavailable. People could be hard of hearing and not hear the rockets or just be apathetic to the sirens, leave the bunker too early out of boredom. The Elderly can often not reach the bunker fast enough. Also the push notification was written in Hebrew so Arabs, Immigrants and the illiterate cannot understand it. Some people don't have access to smartphones. Etc and Etc. 

The one mortality in the West Bank is a case of all the precautions failing. He ignored guidelines and instead watch the rockets fly and then was hit by shrapnel. Plus he was in the West Bank so he likely did not hear alarms or receive the notification and even if he did he likely wouldn't be able to read it. The last attack in April also had a single Israeli casualty, who was a little Arab girl sleeping in a remote village in the Negev desert with no sirens and no bunkers. Luckily she survived after intensive medical care.  

Now the reason I don't think the lack of casualties was intentional on the part of Iran is because of how much damage was caused to civilian areas. Hod Hasharon was hit the hardest where about 100 civilian homes were damaged and as far as I know there are no military targets there. A school in Gedera was hit but that's near a military base. Even Palestine was hit by some of the rockets which is why there was a mortality there. And 2 Jordinians were injured despite being far from any Israeli military bases. Nevatim Airbase was severely hit but all other military targets did not suffer as much damage as civilian areas. 

I really don't see how anyone can think that Iran had any concern for any civilians in the area, including the Palestinian Civilians who the attack was allegedly for. Trying to spin this as a success for Iran or a failure for Israel is inaccurate at best and disinformation at worse. Though if reasonable people think otherwise there's likely some merit to believing it. So CMV.

1gfx6wd,CMV: People should stop telling black men how they ought to vote,"I hate election years because its constant drama and everything is made to be political but along with that it seems like the only time everyone suddenly ""cares"" about black men. I am constantly seeing post about how black men OUGHT to vote and why voting for xyz person is in their best interest as if that was a major concern before. The amount of pandering is always annoying and often insulting. For 3/4 years black men are largely ignored and spoken down to but now in the forth year we're seen and some important demographic who's opinions actually matter.

Along with that this the person assumes they know what's best for black men in general which is racist in itself. It makes the assumption that all black men have the same mindset beliefs and values. But even then it's clear people don't actually care about that past the point of getting them to vote for their preferred candidate, essentially viewing black men as pawns

Black men are adults with the same access to all this voting information being shoved down our daily probably more since they are demographic being targeted. In fact when thinking about this, I have received countless solicitations and people telling me to vote, but not a single person has questioned why I don't vote.

all this to say that my view is that people need you quick telling black men how they should vote. We will choose who we vote for based on what we want to see, if we choose to vote at all. Black men voting democrat, republican, independent or not at all is all fine and should be their choice alone.

-Go home, jack up the car, get underneath the car, risk getting old oil all over your body/clothes/and floor

-Drain the oil from the drain pan into a disposable jug

-Take a shower, clean up because its near impossible to not get anything on you.

1fzw96j,CMV: too many people have a victim mentality these days,"A victim mentality is when a person feels like a victim even when there is evidence that says otherwise. I see so many people with this affliction these days, as in their immediate thought when something bad happens or they are stuck in life is that it’s someone elses fault. They think life owes them something, when in fact no one is entitled to anything, not even a moment of happiness or pleasure. this should make people grateful that they have the chance to better their situation but they don't. Most people don’t even realize they have victim mentality. Of course other people are going to look out for themselves first, and you get the short end of the stick.

1fz9vau,CMV: The protesting on campuses isn’t doing much,"I understand the protesting for the recent war with Israel and Palestine, but it just seems like yelling at all wall a lot of the time. From an outside perspective most of these protesters are the stereotypical people who you would think would be protesting. People who look to have zero true connection to the issue. With this they probably have a fraction of an idea of what those people are truly going through. While I get being upset most of the people seem to be virtue signaling and just getting news from biased sources. This in turn imo hurts the ones that are truly affected by this that are protesting, making their actions less.
