1aqz3a1,"CMV: The gun problem in America is too far gone, and there is no viable solution. The shootings will continue to happen forever.","I live in America. I own 1 gun for protection, and if I had to give it up tomorrow due to an outright gun ban, I wouldn't give a shit. Ignoring the fact that the US government would never in a million years even attempt this in the first place, even if they did, there are millions of unregistered guns that would just stay in the owner's possession and we'd never know.

Then you end up in a situation where all the registered gun owners have now given up their guns, but also know that most of the people they wanted to protect themselves from are still in possession of their unregistered guns, so the now gunless people will just find a gun via illegal means, and just keep it hidden at home. Millions of people will wanna do this, and now there is just a much larger black market for guns, and anyone can get one if they really want one (which they will) and we will be back where we started, where everyone still has a gun that wanted one in the first place.

I also think ""fixing the mental health crisis"" is maybe even a more impossible task. That relies on these people willingly getting help for their problems, which completely flies in the face of the macho ""suck it up or i'll give you something to cry about"" culture that every male has instilled in them growing up, and many have not grown out of as an adult. 

I really see no solution to this, and even if there was one, I think we have too many lunatics that would rather let the problem continue than give up their guns, which is absolutely insane to me.",drippyneon,1212,3111,0.7300000190734863,0.7515566625155666,1707948049,/r/changemyview/comments/1aqz3a1/cmv_the_gun_problem_in_america_is_too_far_gone/,2024,2
1azdt9d,CMV: Not cheating is extremely easy and anyone who cheats on their partner actively chose to do it.,"The idea that someone can “accidentally” cheat or that they “just made a stupid mistake” is completely asinine. If you cheat, you had to either purposefully approach another person to cheat with, put yourself in a situation where others would approach you, or be receptive to an unexpected approach. All of these are conscious choices that take more work to do than not to do, and the idea that any of them could be a “mistake” and not a purposeful action is stupid. Even if someone approaches you repeatedly while you are in a relationship, it is a choice not to authoritatively shut them down and continue to be in their presence regularly.

I would change my view if someone can give me a situation where cheating is not an active choice the cheater made and was instead a mistake anyone could have made given the circumstances.",Bagelman263,2409,488,0.9300000071525574,0.5784313725490196,1708831385,/r/changemyview/comments/1azdt9d/cmv_not_cheating_is_extremely_easy_and_anyone_who/,2024,2
1b34ir6,CMV: CEOS and executives should be forced to take paycuts and lose all bonuses before laying anyone off.,"With the sickening amount of layoffs this past year all while companies are reporting ""RECORD PROFITS"". It's clear to me that CEOs and other members of executive management should be required to take paycuts and loose out on all bonuses before they lay a single person off. It is absolutely insane that normal people are suffering while the CEOs get paid out in bonuses for laying people off and reporting these ""record"" profits.

1axovtd,CMV: For American Jews there is a de facto loyalty test to Israel to participate in vast majority Jewish spaces,"I'm an American Jew who was raised in the reform tradition. Been more and less connected to the broader Jewish community at various points in my life. As a grow older with a son of my own I would love to be more connected to the Jewish community, but I'm really turned off by the intense social pressure to uncritically support Israel. 

I don't agree with Israeli government policies both around Palestinians and the fact that Netanyahu is extremely right wing on many other issues as well. As a public school teacher my school is facing budget cuts because the government has ""no money"" but is sending Israel millions and millions of dollars every day. 

Besides that I'm an American citizen, I fail to see why my Jewishness should be contingent on my loyalty to a foreign country.  

When I go to mainstream Jewish spaces I feel intense social pressure to keep my mouth shut. If I were honest about my views I feel I would be ostracized. Mainstream Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation League have called Jews who dare to criticize Israel as ""self-hating""

I try to imagine this situation in any other ethnic group. Just imagining Chinese-Americans being called ""self-hating"" for not supporting the CCP. That would be insane. So why does it happen to Jews?

It was Hitler's viewpoint that Jews were secretly loyal to a foreign government. It's wild to me that mainstream American Jewish organizations have come around to essentially the same view - American Jews must support Israel or they are ""bad Jews.""

Anyway, I'm sad about what is going on Gaza - but also sad because I want to raise my child within the Jewish community and feel very disconnected right now. 

What would change my view: examples of large, mainstream Jewish organizations or communities which accept Jews who criticize Israel

What would not change my view: you should support Israel, you are a bad Jew. That would just prove me right. ",Oborozuki1917,1325,1310,0.7599999904632568,0.48555361143702114,1708654237,/r/changemyview/comments/1axovtd/cmv_for_american_jews_there_is_a_de_facto_loyalty/,2024,2

1apr98a,"CMV: ""not all men"" is the socially righteous position to take","Statistics help show many facts as best as census data provides.

Some of these statistics show that in some places Islamic people are more likely to advocate Sharia. However, if you use these statistics to make generalisations about Islamic people that would be racist and inappropriate, because even a statistical majority does not mean that all Islamic people are that way. This kind of bigotry should be called out.

The same is true when people use statistics to say that black people are more likely to be criminals, or in gangs, and so on.

However ""men"" as a subgroup seems to be an exception. I think it's common to see people argue that it's obvious they aren't talking about all men, or that they are talking about all men because the good ones don't do enough. This is in discourse around gender based violence, where the statistics show that men are responsible for the majority of rapes, sexual assaults etc.

However, basing your view on men as a group on statistics is as flawed as basing your opinion of Muslims, blacks, and anyone else on statistics. It's by definition prejudice, and shoobe called out.

When you highlight that not all black people are criminals and that you shouldn't assume that from their race it is  socially just. The same goes for calling out prejudice against men based on statistics.

1auuhlb,"CMV: The problem with feminism isn't that most feminists bash men, the problem with feminism is that most feminists are far more tolerant of man bashing than woman bashing","I used to think feminists in general bash men. I don't think that's the case now. 

But one thing I have noticed is that feminists do not respond to misandry the way they respond to misogyny. And I believe this is a problem for a movement that's striving for equality. I don't mean ""men are evil creatures should be forced into camps and deprived of porn and exercise so they have to kill each other to get satisfaction"" vs. ""Women are evil creatures and it's up to men to punish them."" There's a big difference there- one belief was acted on the other has only ever been a disgusting fantasy. 

I'm talking about other things. A woman talking about beating up her partner vs a man talking about beating up his partner. Women and men are both victims of domestic violence, and the gap based on what I've seen is not large. But a joke where the man is a victim might get a ""yeah that's not really funny"" while a joke where the woman is a victim might get a ""disgusting misogynist."" Both reactions are disapproving, but one is a lot more intense than the other. It seems feminists almost view misandry as understandable but misplaced anger and misogyny as a horrible entity that needs to be eradicated. 

But I'm open to changing my view and I look forward to hearing others thoughts

1azmbbp,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,"
I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating.",GorrilaRuffy,308,1619,0.5699999928474426,0.32413266227218485,1708862489,/r/changemyview/comments/1azmbbp/cmv_dating_is_objectively_harder_for_men_than_it/,2024,2
1arqgnj,Cmv: People of colour absolutely can be racist,"The notion that black people and POC can’t be racist has become more prevalent in the last few years, usually explained by saying that racism is a system of oppression and because white people have not been traditionally systematically oppressed, they cannot be subject to racism.

My issue with this is that I believe people are mistaking racism with systematic oppression.

Racism as a word, to me at least  simply means prejudice based on race. Any prejudice that is based on someones race or ethnic background is an example of racism.

Systematic racism is a form of oppression based on racial characteristics, and it’s true that white people have rarely been held under these systems.

So the mistake people make is claiming that POC can’t be racist full stop, which is untrue, and actually a racist claim in itself. 

If somebody dislikes white people based on the colour of their skin or the acts of their ancestors that is racism in its rawest form, just like any other.",serialrimmer,606,1211,0.7400000095367432,0.32041028239889546,1708031776,/r/changemyview/comments/1arqgnj/cmv_people_of_colour_absolutely_can_be_racist/,2024,2

1ajmref,CMV: Jay-Z made a fool of himself at the Grammy Awards,"The Grammy Awards aired last night and of all the great moments, Jay-Z gave a speech where he implied disrespect to his wife and hip-hop.

The unspoken part is maybe a bit of bias and racism? Also a little bit of targeting at the sensation known as Taylor Swift?

A little bit of verbal activism and righteousness without much a bite in my opinion.

Beyonce has won 32 Grammy Awards. She is the all-time winner in the history of music. In terms of the Grammy Awards and subjectiness of art... She is considered the all-time best.

Several black artists have won the top prize over the years, including pure hip-hop like OutKast.

In terms of hip-hop being disrespected, didn't they dedicate last year's show to the history of hip-hop? I believe that Questlove produced it, and 20+ acts performed.

The telecast is the telecast, but the Grammys is genre based. They still have to give awards to the best Americana and Polka albums at some point, too. It can't all be a tribute to Beyonce.

You still need time to acknowledge what artists like Billie Elish are doing as well. Pure pop music was absolutely gigantic this year.

All genres of music are represented.

1aoh83p,"CMV: Loli AND shota, although not illegal is still CP and I think you should try to get help if you like the category.","Alright, I know I'm on Reddit (home of the neckbeards) but in my defense, I am actually trying to get my view changed.

I thought this was common knowledge. That is the literal appeal. the fact that they look + act, and sometimes are children. (especially in Shotacon where they don't even use the 9000 yr old child excuse.), However, when I see people defending it, it is always trying to someone claim that either they are a child or it isn't a weird kink. both arguments I do not agree with. 

they are CLEARLY a child or at least trying to portray a child and are attracted to children, fictional, anime, cartoons, dolls. is WEIRD. 

I don't think these people are going to go out and hurt real children or look for real cp.

1b2o53w,CMV: it is impossible to ethically accumulate and deserve over a billion dollars,"Alright, so my last post was poorly worded and I got flamed (rightly so) for my verbiage. So I’ll try to be as specific in my definitions as possible in this one.

I personally believe that someone would hypothetically deserve a billion dollars if they 1. worked extremely hard and 2. personally had a SUBSTANTIAL positive impact on the world due to their work. The positive impact must be substantial to outweigh the inherent harm and selfishness of hoarding more wealth than one could ever spend, while millions of people starve and live in undignified conditions.

Nowadays there are so many billionaires that we forget just what an obscene amount of money that is. Benjamin Franklin’s personal inventions and works made the world a better place and he became rich because of it. Online sources say he was one of the 5 richest men in the country and his lifetime wealth was around $10mil-$50mil. I would say he deserved that wealth because of the beneficial material impact his work had on the people around him. Today there are around 3-4 thousand billionaires in the world, and none of them have had a substantial enough positive impact to deserve it.

Today, there are many people working hard on lifesaving inventions around the world. However, these people will likely never make billions. If the research department of a huge pharma company comes up with a revolutionary cancer treatment, the only billionaires who will come out of it are the owners and executives. If someone single-handedly cured cancer, and made a billion from it, I would say that is ethical and deserved. But that is a practical impossibility in the world today. Money flows up to those who are already ultra-rich, and who had little to do with the actual achievement, in almost all cases.

On entertainment: there are many athletes, musicians, and other entertainers who have amassed billions. I recognize that entertainment is valuable and I do think they deserve to be rich, but not billionaires. That’s just too much money and not enough impact.

Top athletes are very talented, hardworking, and bring a lot of joy to their fans. I don’t think they bring enough joy to justify owning a billion dollars. If Messi single-handedly cured depression in Argentina, I’d say he deserves a billion. There’s nothing you can do with a sports ball that ethically accumulates that much money.

Yes, a lot of that money comes from adoring fans who willingly spend their money to buy tickets and merch. Michael Jordan has made over $6 billion in royalties from Nike. But I would argue that there is little ethical value in selling branded apparel or generating revenue based on one’s persona or likeness. It’s not unethical, but it doesn’t change the world for the better. MJ deserves to be rich but doesn’t deserve billions. I’m open to debate on this.

My general point here is that if you look at any list of billionaires, the vast majority are at the top of massive companies and profit directly or indirectly off of the labor of others. You could say that’s just how to world works but that doesn’t mean it’s right. I don’t think there is any person who has individually contributed enough to the betterment of the world in their lifetime and has also amassed a billion dollars. I am open to any particular billionaires and their work that might change my mind. I also should say that this is a strongly held belief of mine so I would be hard pressed to offer deltas but I absolutely will if someone provides an example of one person who has made a billion that deserves it.",champagne_papaya,687,945,0.7200000286102295,0.2944707107267708,1709171094,/r/changemyview/comments/1b2o53w/cmv_it_is_impossible_to_ethically_accumulate_and/,2024,2
1apxvv3,CMV: Abortion pills should be as accessible as a can of tuna at Walmart,"Abortion should be as accessible as a can of tuna because it's a fundamental aspect of reproductive healthcare. Easy access ensures timely interventions, reducing risks to women's health and well-being. Restricting access disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating inequalities. Accessibility respects bodily autonomy, empowering individuals to make informed choices about their lives. It promotes safer procedures, minimizing the need for dangerous alternatives.

1amad3o,"CMV: We can throw billions of dollars at public schools all we want, but until parents care more about their children’s academic performance nothing will change","We can’t spend our way out of it. We’ve tried. Look at the NYC public school system. We’ve shoveled dump trucks worth of money into their pockets and, while seeing some *marginal* improvements among some elements of the student body, have gotten nothing for it beyond more debt. America can’t wipe our asses for us, it’s not our mommy/daddy and we need to take responsibility for our lives and the lives of our children. And that means buckling down and making sure your kid is studying, doing their homework, **going to class** and in general giving two shits about their academic performance. No amount of money from the nanny state can fix that. Unfortunately, this problem is so deep and widely rooted I don’t know how the government *can* fix it.

In addition, the racial climate in America right now is just not conducive to discussions on a child’s poor performance. 69% of urban public schoolteachers in the United States are white.

Parents are already extremely defensive about their children and then if you add the ugly history of race relations in America on top of it? Not a conducive environment for early interventions in troubled students lives. It’s the sad truth but you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. If the kid don’t care about reading, writing, or education in general you can’t force them to care. It has to come from the parent or guardian.

1b1i1rf,"CMV: The Palestine supporter who killed himself was a father, and for that reason I believe his act was selfish ","I am referring to the man who lit himself on fire while proclaiming “free palestine”. 
   
When I heard he left behind a child I really felt he acted selfishly.
   
I do believe a father can lay down his life for the greater good in a worthy circumstance. But the bar is very high. 
   
I dont believe his act will affect the status of Palestinian freedom. And I believe it would be reasonable for him to conclude this assuming he wasnt wrapped up in self righteousness or delusions of grandeur.
   
Another thing - the Israeli Palestine conflict was already mainstream global news. He hasnt shed any more light on an obscure story. Its already covered and saturated by awareness.
   
As for your children… Its one thing to leave behind loved ones - that hurts them and leaves them less than they were with you in their life.
   
Its another to leave behind children. You have a responsibility to your children to take care of them and provide them love and a knowledge of how to make it in the world.
   
There are ways you can improve the world without abandoning the most vulnerable kind of person possible that needs you - you directly. 
   
Ultimately the act becomes a shock symbol of how much he values his opinion on the conflict. We all get to stand back and admire how much conviction he had - how far he would go to make a statement about a current event - which will ultimately do nothing but rob his child of a parent.

1aszk01,CMV: Belief in religion is nothing more than believing in fairy tales or magic,"Any religion could absolutely be true, but there is 0 convincing evidence for any. There are vague philosophical arguments to be made for the existence of a soul or a creator/god in some form, but this CMV is specifically about following large religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and similar. I am more familiar with Christianity, although not fully and I plan to educate myself more, but I have very vague understandings of the others.

Currently I find myself extremely anti-religion and I want my view changed if possible to be more tolerant of those around me. I just do not understand how someone can follow a religion. Theres 0 evidence, all based on ""faith"" in a book written thousands of years ago and then rewritten and translated constantly over time. I dont see how believing in Christianity is any different to believing in magic. People I have talked to just sound brainwashed into believing it and it becoming a core part of themselves to the point where its too uncomfortable to change.

I do not see how in the modern day, belief in religion is logical. People will point to smart people believing in religion, but again, that just seems like brainwashing to me and is just trying to appeal to authority. I dont want arguments based in ""smart person did it so it must be true"", but rather why belief is logical. 

I find the argument of ""belief isnt logical, you just feel it"" or similar things also very weak. They just fall under ""ive been brainwashed and/or emotions make this belief comfortable so ill follow it"", rather than actual coherent thoughts and reasoning.

Looking back I'm noticing it's always been there but it's never been called out and was largely presented as acceptable. Numerous shows present misandry as a comedic thing even when the charater is harmed. In the show 'The King of Queens"", Carrie is extremely misandrist and abusive to Doug, who is scared of his wife, and it's played as a funny thing. I was watching paternity court and whenever a man says something like ""Women love to trap men with babies"" the judge (a woman) will go off on them but then in a different episode will make statements like ""men will tell you whatever in order to get you in bed"". 

I think one of the good things is that it's starting to be talked about a bit more but the fact that there's still a debate about it is insane to me. I can't think of any other form of bigotry that is not only present but also defended in common society.

Their war actually advances them in both of those objectives (For the first: reportedly 10K Hamas members are dead, less than a quarter of their divisions are still able to operate, and they barely manage to fire rockets at Israel anymore, For the second: a few hostages were released by force and more than a 100 hostages were released during a temporary truce deal that was achieved by military pressure), nevertheless, they didn't fully achieve either of those goals yet.  
Asking them to unilaterally stop the war is asking them to surrender and die, as Hamas continue to declare they'd continue killing Israelis as soon as they can. Their supporters in the west echo this sentiment (""no peace on stolen land"", ""from the river to the sea"", ""intifada"", ""we don't want no two states"").

It usually assumes that democracy is more moral than authoritarianism (which I agree with to a certain extant), therefore the USA's foreign policy is broadly moral.

But that's just not true.

America allies with undemocratic states all the time, most notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia today, but also in the past. South Korea and Taiwan were dictatorships until 1987. Pakistan has shifted between democracy and military rule numerous times. The USA has often directly propped up dictators in other places as well like South Vietnam and Indonesia to secure their economic interests. Sometimes they even toppled governments that were elected democratically or were in favour of democracy, like in Iran and countless times in Latin America.

This pattern in foreign policy cannot be explained by the USA's willingness to protect democracy, but its willingness to secure its own economic interest. Egypt controls the Suez Canal and Saudi Arabia controls the oil. The USA must work with these authoritarian countries to ensure control over its own economic interests.

My view: WBD doesn’t want to release the film themselves nor sell it to other studios. With that, it would be perfectly ok (although illegal) for someone to leak the film on the internet, just like they did with “Scooby and Krypto”, a movie that would have had the same fate if not for a leak.

1arpifv,CMV: Leaving NATO would be one of the worst foreign policy decisions a President could make,"In case you haven't seen it, Reddit's favorite President, Donald John Trump, has been teasing the US stepping back from NATO, [telling his aids he's considering withdrawing America from the alliance](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html). It seems that MAGA conservatives and left-wing radicals alike are open to isolating the US from our NATO allies, which I think would be a generationally awful foreign policy blunder, ultimately resulting in bloody war in Europe. 

While this may have been a different discussion in early 2020, Putin has now made his imperial ambitions and willingness to wage war clear. His invasion of the sovereign state of Ukraine was an unprecedented violation of all the laws and norms of war Europe established after World War 2. Putin has made his ambition to recapture other former Soviet Republics clear, and it seems self-evident that the only thing stopping Putin from eventually invading NATO allies is his fear of triggering NATO's Article 5 and falling into a war with the United States.

While other NATO members have their own armies, they suck. [All other NATO allies combined have a smaller fighting force than Russia or the US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/584286/number-of-military-personnel-in-nato-countries/), and their technology and training are generally regarded as woefully inadequate. Turkey is the only other NATO ally with a decent army, but they're also the most unreliable in the alliance (along with Hungary). Without the guarantee of US mutual defense, I don't think that the threat of European NATO allies alone would be enough to deter further Russian expansion once they finish the war in Ukraine, and have the time to rebuild their army.

1ahyd7d,CMV: The sentence of Bryn Spejcher for stabbing her boyfriend to death was ridiculous.,"I'm refering to the California woman who stabbed her boyfriend 108 times after consuming cannabis and only sentenced last month to 100 days of community service.

This case reminds me of Sarah Halimi's one in France where an elderly lady got thrown off a window by a man who had just taken cannabis before his rampage and was considered not criminally responsible penally.

Although, contrarily to that other murder I do think that Bryn was indeed in a serious state of psychosis as she not only stabbed her boyfriend but her dog, and herself. And when the police intervened, even taser and baton strikes were not very effective at stopping her.

That being said I do believe that the sentence she received was highly problematic (way too low) for these 4 reasons:

* Even if marijuana frenzies can potentially happen on rare occasions, I just don't believe a mentally stable person could reach such violence with only marijuana. This led me to believe that she either consumed other additional substances or that she has some sort of mental instability that can lead her to become violent in some instances. And if that second hypothesis is true, then she needs psychiatric treatment (which was the decision for Sarah Halimi's murderer)
* Maybe the most important of my 4 points: Her not being aware during the killing doesn't mean she isn't responsible for it. The fact that she willingly decided to take psychotropic drugs that could potentially cloud her judgment meant she was responsible for putting herself in that state. Correct me if I'm wrong but if a person after consuming alcohol becomes violent a attacks others, he will be convicted. Removing all responsibility for marijuana sounds like encouragement for murderers to use this excuse and be cleared of charges.
* Receiving only 100 days of community service after brutally killing someone is shameful and a total disrespect for the deceased and his family. It just isn't right.
* Let's not fool ourselves, she only got this miraculous judgment because she was an upper-class white woman. If it was a man, poor or of color that sentencing would have been different.

And for these 4 reasons are believe that Bryn judgment was not only unfair but dangerous.",vuzz33,544,621,0.8299999833106995,0.21271705709824096,1706973492,/r/changemyview/comments/1ahyd7d/cmv_the_sentence_of_bryn_spejcher_for_stabbing/,2024,2

I am a current Criminal Justice student and I interact with a lot of police content, both from the pro and anti side. I've seen enough horrible things to fully support police reform in this country, especially in rural departments that still operate like it's 1960.

The view that I hold is that 6-8 weeks of training is NOT enough for law enforcement officers, period. This is my second semester and we are barley scratching the surface. We spent an entire week on Search and Seizure case law and that was just the intro class, there is way more to learn in Constitutional Law and Legal Ethics.

The concepts we're just starting to get into this semester are very complicated and nuanced and require vast amounts of context to fully understand. I can't fathom how a police officer can learn enough at the academy when most of the training hours are spent on tactics and police operations.

Is eight weeks enough time to learn how tactics, firearms, and operations? Yes!

Is there enough time left over after all that to get even a baseline understanding of the law? NO

My post is probably going to sound like a screed from the John Birch Society, but I have a lot of loose thoughts here.

There was a meanness and sickness to the culture at times, that we simply might have forgotten.

As someone who has followed politics, I can't stress how wild and nutty the Obama v. McCain election cycle was. Those McCain/Palin rallies were full of unhinged and crazy people. It's true that McCain was a relatively measured man, but the lines of people outside his rallies were pretty much the same MAGA people without the label yet. They were the eventual “tea party” people. I've never believed the myth that rank & file MAGA loyalists were non-political and simply got woke up in 2016.

It's the same usual suspects. They have just put their former campaign accouterments in storage.

There was a nastiness in popular culture for a while. 

All those daytime talk shows like Jerry Springer were common on all the networks. Go back and watch clips of these shows. Audience members take the microphone and call people on a panel, “BIG FAT SLUTTY PIGS!” to the roar of the crowd.

I was a massive Howard Stern radio show fan. An era where he would get disabled people to fight with the Klu Klux Klan, or openly use the “n-word” on terrestrial radio. Trump was a frequent guest.

There were just a lot of sleazy things that wouldn't be around today. A popular television commercial was for “Bum Fights,” a mail order VHS where someone got homeless people to attack each other.

Never mind Tucker going to Russia. Late '90s and early 2000s political media was horrendous. Anyone remember MSNBC's Michael Savage? He was telling people to get AIDS on TV.

This was the tone of the media. Bush v. Kerry was a wild and crazy election cycle, too. I remember Zell Miller challenging Chris Mathews to a duel on live television, or Ann Coulter calling Al Gore a ""f*g"" on TV, without much notice in pre-Twitter world.

Trump comes from celebrity popular culture. My first board game as a child was a Donald Trump one. He comes from this world.

He was a character. Comedy Central did a celebrity roast for him right before he became a candidate. They've never re-aired it, and simply pretend it never existed. Most of the jokes were about how he could grab any “pussy” he wanted because he was rich.

Trump was a long-planted seed that finally produced fruit. I've known that some populist crazy celebrity was going to eventually arrive. WWF wrestlers were becoming Governor in Minnesota.

Therefore, the birthrate per woman in an urbanized liberal society will always be below replacement. Case in point: not a single Nordic country has managed to get to replacement level fertility despite their heavily subsidized childcare as well as other welfare programs.

The ugly truth is that replacement level fertility in urbanized populations can only be the result of society-wide cultural and/or economic coercion, so, for example, European countries' only choices are replacement migration and regression to a pro-family culture that would by definition stigmatize childlessness.",KitezhGrad,269,830,0.6800000071525574,0.18922991690194235,1707249228,/r/changemyview/comments/1akitl9/cmv_replacement_level_fertility_is_impossible_in/,2024,2

1armn1r,Cmv: Kids are disrespectful toward the school system because it's disrespectful toward them.,"When I was in school I remember clearly, the overarching message coming from the teachers, staff, the entire school system in general was this: ""We don't care how you feel, we don't care what you think, you're here to do what we tell you to. If you don't do what we want, you're worthless to us."" 

Students who did poorly were often singled out and mentioned by name as examples of what not to be. Students who obviously came from neglectful homes were given no extra help or leniency, they were just treated as failures when they were clearly suffering and not allowed basic hygiene at home. How can you expect someone to get their work done when they don't even have a clean table at home? The students who were treated fairly were the ones who lived in the same subdivisions as the teachers, the ones who live in the neighborhood and who's parents hang out with the teachers as friends. 

There was a clear rift, if you could afford to live in the middle class subdivisions you were worth something and the teachers treated you like a person, if you couldn't afford to live there you were treated with disrespect. Poor kids were seen as a bad influence on the middle class subdivisioners, and so didn't deserve respect. They were always bad right from the start to the teachers. 

There were times I walked up to the teacher to ask for help, and they would stop and make me go away when one of their preferred students would come ask for help, or sometimes refuse to help at all. 

When I see teachers talk about problem students online they don't talk about the factors that cause them, and chock it up to ""lack of discipline.""

1aktlq9,CMV: talking about politics early in a relationship (even on the first date) is healthy and shouldn't be frowned upon especially in the United states,"I was inspired to post this here after reading an article in late 2022 early 2023 after the Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion (the Dobbs decision) that overturned roe v wade. 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/29/relationships-post-roe/&ved=2ahUKEwif6JzHkZiEAxXsm4kEHQ-1AmQ4ChDF9AEoAHoECAsQAg&usg=AOvVaw1d0y_ODgBmhuXN63xJR_KK

It says that more and more couples are reevaluating their long term relationships with their partners or spouses over the controversial dobbs decision in June of 2022. Many hadn't had that conversation with their partners or considered their partners postions at all. In the article it states how many are asking new partners or dates how they feel about it early on to see if they would be on the same page or if they should end the relationship before it gets more serious.

Now that got me thinking. I believe that it's extremely healthy for dates and new couples to talk extensively about politics in the beginning of relationships. When you think of it politics controls alot of out lives whether its a supreme court decision like dobbs or roe or a local issue like the town council expanding a local park both those issues involve politics. So how does not talking about politics early in a relationship not benefit people really by seeing if a potential spouse and you have the same values in life. Even ben Shapiro agrees with this 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dr1cK1WoL2HE&ved=2ahUKEwi59cuplpiEAxU_jYkEHc4ZBzIQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2QWbRsuE0M6ksLhrHZza3O

Now many will say politics doesn't equal values and that you shouldn't limit yourself or not want to date people bases on their political opinions. A famous couple who are in a relationship like that are democratic strategist James Carville and his wife republican strategist Mary matalin make it work (despite her joining the libertarian party with the rise of trump). I argue relationships like that came to be in an Era when Americans weren't ""political"" in a sense but since 2016 America has become a very political nation like European counties. Which can be shown with this study from the United Kingdom 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dating-relationships-tory-politics-b2095705.html&ved=2ahUKEwjNkr78pZiEAxXsjIkEHXkgDkcQFnoECBQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0Q6gE6zFYeFPiTgHYYsdoN

So I think debating and learning someone's politics early in a relationship is a healthy thing to do. Why would I want to invest time and energy in a relationship with someone whom I don't share my values (this is especially true if your non religious) why would I want to buy a house with someone who doesn't think climate change is real and wants to buy a beach house because nothing will happen. Why would I want to date someone who treats a homeless person with disdain if I value empathy and especially with bodily autonomy why would a woman want to date a man who doesn't value her bodily autonomy and why should I who might value euthanasia and ""pulling the plug"" want to date someone who doesn't belive in that either. Americans have (albeit an increasingly less) interest or stomach for giving their political opinions in public especially in the dating world and I think that in order to not waste either parties time that should and need to change.",SnooPeripherals2455,511,510,0.8199999928474426,0.18802781917536016,1707277436,/r/changemyview/comments/1aktlq9/cmv_talking_about_politics_early_in_a/,2024,2
1b35xqj,CMV: Abortion should be legal and fine,"let me start off by saying that, yes, I'm pro-choice, but pro-life people seem to not understand half of what being pro-choice means and are mainly Christian (probably the reason why there's so many people who hate abortion or are pro-life), the reason I think abortion should be legal and available is because of many reasons, let's start off with the main ones. Let me, who the actual hell thinks it's alright for a rape victim to be forced to carry the child of someone who not only raped them, but traumatized them beyond comprehension, why should they have to carry the child of there rapist? Some may say, ""it's not the baby's fault!"" I'd argue that even if it's not the babies fault, the women shouldn't be forced to keep the child of her rapist, it's not only a constant reminder of what they went through but life three threating in some cases and it's also the fact that they didn't choose to have the child forced into them, why should they be forced to hold the child of there rapist, the person who ruined there life in many ways, why should the victim not only have to take the consequences of there rapists actions aka have a whole ass child from the very same person who traumatized them in multiple different ways, why should the victim be forced to go through the pain of labor and pregnancy pain for months on end and then go through hours of extreme pain just because of someone else's actions? Why should the victim have the change or make a life time long change that could ruin there life against there will and if they want to keep it, they can but I'm talking about those who were raped and don't want to ruin there life because of someone else. They shouldn't be forced to is what should be the answer of any sane human being.

second main reason; what about children (specifically teens or younger) who got raped, for them it could be even worse, a teens body isn't ready for that type of pain yet, it could also damage there internal organs and nor are teens financially, mentally, emotionally, nor physically ready for that responsibility, so why should a teen, be forced to potentially ruin her life in every way possible because of someone else's actions? Again, the answer for any sane and mentally well human being would be that the teen shouldn't have to unless they want to. This also goes for teens who weren't raped, there teens, hormones hit like a bitch, there not gonna be worrying about protection because when they have the chance to have sex with someone they like, there gonna take that chance, and teens also can't purchase condoms either which makes my point even stronger.

third main reason; What about incest? the whole reason why I say this is obvious, the child is the product of incest and would have a whole list of disorders and wouldn't live that long, the child would also, (if it lives) have a bad life in public and in school, people these days will sit there and shit on your for existing and point out all your insecurities and more, just to make you feel like shit, an incest baby would live one of the worst lives, not only having parents that are related and having a huge list of disorders and disabilities, but would be absolutely picked on and bullied or worse, people these days [do.Not.Care](https://do.Not.Care).

fourth main reason; what about women or men who poke holes in the condom? for females, that's basically rape and forcing the male to be forced to pay child support (because if you found out your partner did this, no way in hell any sane man would stay with her) and for a male, it's the same thing, it's basically rape and forced impregnation and she wouldn't know until it's to late, again, not her or his fault that there partner did this to them.

fifth main reason; what about the fact that it's her body, she's the one that's gonna have to be in pain while carrying and giving birth to the child, it's the women's body, not yours, your not the one carrying the child, she is, it should be her choice if she's ready for a child or not.",imadethistocomment15,132,969,0.6600000262260437,0.1831349651920054,1709227697,/r/changemyview/comments/1b35xqj/cmv_abortion_should_be_legal_and_fine/,2024,2

Here's what it feels like has happened: Because libertarianism deeply complicate the liberal-conservative or anti-facist-facist binary that makes political polarization possible and keeps social media discussions conveniently simplistic, liberals have intentionally begun rhetorically conflating libertarianism with fascism while attempting to ideologically co-opt the attractive freedoms of libertarianism.

Here is the link if you haven't see it before. It's not necessary to watch it to respond though.


https://youtu.be/m4Z_fNDq_Pc?si=ryV4z7PPu35dbBdy


It's almost like Neil expected an ""obviously no I wouldn't"" and was surprise that that wasn't the answer.

Honestly it's a bit ridiculous that not only was he expecting the answer to be no but also was surprised by the possibility of the answer being yes.

Like yes Neil, some people don't like the idea of being dead. That's surprising to you?

If anything it should be the more expected position for the average person until they say otherwise.

Anyways, I'm full on board with Larry here. Rip to him he died a while ago btw. I, like him, can't stand the idea of not being alive.

But I want to adress Neil's argument more here.

He says that the absence of death means a lack of urgency and why would you even get out of bed because there's always tomorrow.

I believe this is a dumb argument. If I lived forever I would maybe stay for longer in bed. But that means because I have more time I can relax more which is not a bad thing at all.

I don't think Neil would say this is a bad thing which means it's more likely he meant you would have people stay in bed for... ever?

Like never get out of bed? Spend all day eating popcorn and watching TV?

Ummm no Neil, people would still want to improve their lives today rather than tomorrow.

But perhaps it would be this year rather than next.

Like sure it would he easier to put things off but that doesn't mean I still wouldn't want to get things done. 

Besides if I do more per day with a finite life, that doesn't mean a finite life is going to make you do more.

An infinite life you could still do more if you work only 10% as hard, which again I'm not suggesting people will do.

So why the hell is a finite life better?

Infacy with a finite life your appreciation of your accomplishments will come to an end when your life is over.

With an infinite you can appreciate your life achievements for longer and you'll have more to appreciate.

Yes the urgency won't be as high in an infinite life but 1- that's not necessarily a bad thing and 2- there will still be a sense of urgency because people want to better their lives",murkylai,350,612,0.8500000238418579,0.17100490646414743,1708005860,/r/changemyview/comments/1arg4wp/cmv_if_i_could_live_forever_i_absolutely_would/,2024,2

1apbsy8,"CMV: Within 15 years, universal basic income will be a necessity as AI replaces the majority of jobs","We all know that AI usage has exploded in the last few years. While there is an undercurrent of fear regarding the eventual sentience of AI, the more practical and current concern is how AI will eventually change the job market.

Companies are now laying off employees and replacing them with AI, like [Google firing 30,000 employees](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-plans-layoff-30000-employees-fight-between-ai-humans-nath-esj8c/). While some have speculated that AI won't take over the majority of jobs, only improving workflow, I find this thought to be naive.

AI is not the printer press, the cotton gin, or the automobile. While those innovations did replace certain industries (the automobile made blacksmiths and ferriers unnecessary since everyone eventually stopped riding around in horse and buggy), they also created new industries that increased production within the overall job market.

This is not what AI does. AI does not simply make one or two industries obsolete; it has the potential to make the *majority* of human workers in most industries obsolete. It does not have the means to increase production beyond what it takes away from the job market.

This isn't simply, ""Oh you lost your job due to innovation? You should find new skills."" Because beyond labor workers (construction, trade skills, military, etc.), *all* skills can eventually be done by AI and done better.

And people are skeptical saying, ""Well, it can't write code write now."" or ""The blogs it writes are terrible."" While that may be so, the exponential growth means that AI will eventually be good enough to replace the majority of white collar and creative jobs.

It's not simply a new innovation. It will eventually be (and I presume very quickly) an entire restructuring of work. Why should companies pay actual humans that are falable when they hire however many workers to run the AI and produce whatever the organization needs for exponentially cheaper?

Eventually, and I'm guessing within 15 years, AI will reshape the job market to the point where universal basic income will become a necessity for people to simply get money and survive.

I'm hopeful that someone can change my view on this because I certainly don't want this to happen. I would like the majority of people to keep their jobs, but I currently don't see a future where one of three things happen:

1. UBI is mandated.
2. Laws are passed that require companies to have X% of human workers.
3. A combination of the two.",MiltonRoad17,336,533,0.7400000095367432,0.1554022544035886,1707773885,/r/changemyview/comments/1apbsy8/cmv_within_15_years_universal_basic_income_will/,2024,2
1b0tbbq,CMV: I am not convinced that a one-state solution is the best solution for the Israel-Palestine situation,"Let me make it very clear from the start that I am not trying to have a debate here on the legality/morality of Israel's actions in Gaza right now.

I've been seeing a rise in popularity in the ""one state solution"" to this conflict, particularly among progressives and especially among progressive commentators.

The one state solution from what I am understanding would mean:

\- (In theory) Free and democratic elections

\- Equal rights for all, regardless of ethnicity, religion, or any other identifying characteristic

Whether it's called ""Israel"" or ""Palestine"" or something else doesn't really matter.

I don't really have an issue with this premise. It will solve the issues around territorial disputes and settlements, two issues that have been sticking points in two-state negotiations for a long time. It also resolves the Palestinian right to return issue, which is another major hurdle in negotiations. Both parties will also have free access to important religious sites.

I think practically this won't work though, and here's why I think that (let's assume both parties' representatives agree to the one state):

\- Both Israelis and Palestinians have been scarred by this conflict and I don't see a world where Israelis in particular feel safe/OK sharing a country with people they perceive to be hostile to them

\- I am almost 100% certain in this new state there will be systemic racism towards Arabs/Muslims

\- I'm pretty confident that, while Hamas/other militant groups will lose a lot of support with the advent of freedom/democracy for all, separatist groups will still persist and commit acts of terrorism (like we saw with Spain and Ireland)

\- I fear the implications of acts of terrorism persisting in this single nation. With the case of the Basque in Spain, for example, while democracy and autonomy really plummeted support for the ETA (the Basque separatist/terrorist group), attacks persisted by a faction who were dead set on having the Basque Country be an independent sovereign state, or ""free from Spain"". While Spain, after the death of Franco, ceased collectively punishing the Basque for their terrorism I am not confident that this single state (which, let's be honest, is likely going to see Jews hold the majority of the power in government) is going to take kindly with the likely scenario that acts of terrorism will persist by separatist groups

Since the whole ""one state solution"" seems to be quite popular with progressives, and since I agree with the premise, I'd love to be convinced that this is a favorable solution to the two-state, but I personally just don't see it as a practical/realistic solution.",_Richter_Belmont_,138,780,0.7099999785423279,0.1540042103442851,1708982827,/r/changemyview/comments/1b0tbbq/cmv_i_am_not_convinced_that_a_onestate_solution/,2024,2

1atg59o,CMV: A requirement to be associated with a “well regulated militia” would be a great start to curbing gun violence.,"IMO guns are awesome. Some of the best days of my life have started with a trip to the dollar store to get a bunch of nicknacks, putting those nicknacks on a berm and making said nicknacks into many smaller nicknacks through the liberal (no pun intended) application of freedom pellets. 

However, I would give that up tomorrow if I never had to read about a school shooting ever again.

I get that “a well regulated militia” meant something else when the bill of rights was written and that the Supreme Court already ruled that the right to bare arms is an individual right. However, this isn’t the 18th century anymore and our founders gave us the opportunity to amend the constitution. Why can’t we make state militias a thing and require gun owners to join the militia with requirements to train on gun use and safety? Gun ownership is a responsibility. I can think of several people I know who don’t practice the absolute basics of gun safety, but use their firearms regularly.

At the very least, this would allow a regular check in with gun owners and an opportunity for people to raise red flags if someone seems “off” or doesn’t practice good safety practices.

We can’t agree to anything related to the second amendment but we can all agree that gun violence sucks. Would it really be such a bad thing to have a practice that ensured that everyone that owned a gun knew how to use it properly and safely?",ChuckyShadowCow,162,726,0.6000000238418579,0.1503066490054773,1708214008,/r/changemyview/comments/1atg59o/cmv_a_requirement_to_be_associated_with_a_well/,2024,2
1ajlwj2,CMV: Parents have no right to hit their child. Spanking a child is a form of physical abuse that requires intervention and counseling by CPS or other authorities.,"  
It is commonly agreed that denying a child food or medical care constitutes child abuse, because of the adverse impacts on the child's health, physical and emotional development, and wellbeing. We have reached this conclusion based on numerous long term research studies that have demonstrated the adverse impacts of these practices. Drinking while pregnant with your child is similarly considered a form of child abuse, because of its negative effects on child development.  


However, despite decades of scientific research and an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that spanking or corporal punishment in children creates a host of adverse effects on the child, we still accept that parents have the right to punish their children in this manner.   


**What does the research say?**  


* A landmark meta-analysis published in 2002 showed that **of** **27 studies on physical punishment and child aggression,** **all found a significant positive relation,** regardless of the size of the sample, location of study, ages of the children or any other variable. (Gershoff ET. Corporal punishment by parents and associated child behaviors and experiences: a meta-analytic and theoretical review. Psychol Bull 2002;128:539–79)  

* Physical punishment is **associated with a range of mental health problems in children, youth and adults, including depression, unhappiness, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness, use of drugs and alcohol,** and general psychological maladjustment. (Turner HA, Muller PA. Long-term effects of child corporal punishment on depressive symptoms in young adults: potential moderators and mediators. J Fam Issues 2004;25:761–82)  

* Intriguing results are now emerging from neuroimaging studies, which suggest that **physical punishment may reduce the volume of the brain’s grey matter** in areas associated with performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III). (Tomoda A, Suzuki H, Rabi K, et al. Reduced prefrontal cortical gray matter volume in young adults exposed to harsh corporal punishment. Neuroimage 2009;47:T66–71)  

* Physical punishment can cause **alterations in the dopaminergic regions associated with vulnerability to the abuse of drugs and alcohol.** (Sheu Y-S, Polcan A, Anderson CM, et al. Harsh corporal punishment is associated with increased T2 relaxation time in dopamine-rich regions. Neuroimage 2010;53:412–9)

&#x200B;

* Researchers are also finding that **physical punishment is linked to slower cognitive development and adversely affects academic achievement.** (Straus MA, Paschall MJ. Corporal punishment by mothers and development of children’s cognitive ability: a longitudinal study of two nationally representative age cohorts. J Aggress Maltreat Trauma 2000;18:459–83)

  
Similarly, research has demonstrated that there is a high correlation between spanking and serious physical abuse.  The Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS 1998) showed that 75% of substantiated physical abuse of children occurred during episodes of physical punishment.  Another large Canadian study found that children who were spanked by their parents were seven times more likely to be severely assaulted by their parents (e.g., punched or kicked) than children who were not spanked. In an American study, infants in their first year of life who had been spanked by their parents in the previous month were 2.3 times more likely to suffer an injury requiring medical attention than infants who had not been spanked. (Crandall M, Chiu B, Sheehan K. Injury in the first year of life: risk factors and solutions for high-risk families. J Surg Res 2006; 133:7–10) This indicates to me that allowing corporal punishment opens the door for other forms of more severe physical violence.   
**To me it's simple: parents have no right to permanently damage their child's brain, whether that's drinking while pregnant or hitting it after it's born. Any action which permanently harms a child's brain development is a form of child abuse that requires intervention.** ",Plastic-Abroc67a8282,46,817,0.5299999713897705,0.14085579110479707,1707153653,/r/changemyview/comments/1ajlwj2/cmv_parents_have_no_right_to_hit_their_child/,2024,2
