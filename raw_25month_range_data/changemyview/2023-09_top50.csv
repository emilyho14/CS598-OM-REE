16glz0r,CMV: The right wing's obsession with trans issues is largely because they have nothing else to talk about.,"I'll be honest. I don't know what the hell is going on with the whole trans thing. I think having a thousand genders is silly and alot of the pronoun stuff also seems weird. 

But I just don't notice it in daily life (and I live in a very liberal city). Trans folk are such a small part of the population, but you would think that there's one in every neighborhood, just waiting to break in and mutilate your family's genitals, considering how the right wing talks about this issue online.

I'm sure that there are many who would genuinely take issue with this stuff anyways, but it seems pretty clear that the *obsessive* nature of the right wing's focus on this issue is because it's an easy, convenient one for them to use as a draw.

They can't talk about the economy

They can't talk about civic health or integrity in office

They have nothing else to appeal to voters, but they can run endless, contextless clips of needledicks like Ben Shapiro or Matt Walsh **""ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING""** some blue-haired college sophomore who doesn't know how to formulate an argument yet. 

It's lazy, it's cynical, and just indicative of the emptiness of the GOP platform.",DiamanteVerde,4175,2241,0.7900000214576721,0.9680451127819549,1694508305,/r/changemyview/comments/16glz0r/cmv_the_right_wings_obsession_with_trans_issues/,2023,9
16ia8w6,CMV: Changing Snow White's race is parallel to changing Black Panther's race,"A new remake of Snow White is currently being made and they've, controversially, changed Snow White’s race. I disagree with this; it comes off as virtue signalling. The character's race was changed to be more diverse, presumably.  
  
Now, I don't see what makes the change in Snow White's ethnicity any different to changing Black Panther to a different ethnicity or race. Snow White’s ethnicity and complexion are integral to her character, hence her name. One relatively 'big' part of the story is her complexion and how she is the ‘fairest of them all,’ and unique because of it. Similarly, Black Panther’s name originates from the Black Panther party and his race is relatively important compared to most characters. \`  
  
Even as a person who leans left (essentially centrist), there is the double standard that much of the left holds. The double standard is the opinion or view that changing a white person’s race is okay, or perhaps even great, but changing a black person’s race is racist and deemed whitewashing. I understand there is some nuance here but I still believe the two things are on a similar level. Whitewashing is bad because it pushes forward the message that being black is ‘bad’ or not desirable. Blackwashing should be seen as bad as it pushes forward the message that whiteness is not desirable. Perhaps the intention of blackwashing in media is to be diverse, but again, I find this to be virtue signalling and there are better ways to go about this… just make new characters or new movies.  
  
In my opinion, race should not be changed if it’s an original and old character, particularly if it’s relatively integral to the character’s identity. Just make new characters.  
  
I assume that I will get replies that point out that Snow White is not Disney’s story and there are many different versions, thus, it’s not necessarily race-swapping characters. But that’s wrong:  
  


>  
Snow White is a live-action remake of the Disney animation classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" which debuted in 1937. However, it appears that Disney is approaching the seven dwarf characters in a new way in order to avoid reiterating prejudices from the first animated feature. The lead actress Zegler also hinted at the story's contemporary revisions meant to appeal to the progressive audience during the D23 event.[\[1\]](https://collider.com/snow-white-disney-live-action-remake-release-date-cast-plot/)

  
  
The issue is that Disney and other massive corporations are making *\[x\]* and then advertising it as *\[y\]*. The only reason for this is because these corporations want a bigger audience so they grab nostalgic stories such as Snow White and other classics and then reboot them to get a guaranteed audience. For example, Velma, a TV series where they race-swapped Velma, is hardly the original character- neither are the rest of the characters, really. They marketed the series as Scooby-Doo characters to gain instant and free traction despite the fact they are hardly even the same characters.   
  
So yeah, that’s basically my view. I just don’t agree with the race-swapping of random characters and I think that race-swapping Black Panther is of the same nature as race-swapping Snow White.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

16hxvf8,META: Transgender Topics,"# The Rule Change

Beginning immediately, r/changemyview will no longer allow posts related to transgender topics. The reasons for this decision will follow. This decision has not been made lightly by the administration of this subreddit, and has been the topic of months of discussion.

# Background

Over the past 8 months, r/changemyview has been inundated with posts related to transgender topics. I conducted a survey of these posts, and more than 80% of them ended up removed under Rule B. More importantly, a very large proportion of these threads were ultimately removed by Reddit's administrators. This would not be a problem if the topic was an infrequent one. However, for some periods, we have had between 4 and 8 new posts on transgender-related issues per day. Many days, they have made up more than 50% of the topics of discussion in this subreddit.

# Reasoning

If a post is removed by Reddit or by the moderators of this subreddit under B, we consider the thread a failure. Views have not been changed. Lots of people have spent a lot of time researching and making reasoned arguments in favor of or against a position. If the thread is removed, that effort is ultimately wasted. We respect our commenters too much to allow this to continue.

Furthermore, this subreddit was founded to change views on a wide variety of subjects. When a single topic of discussion so overwhelms the subreddit that other topics cannot be easily discussed, that goal is impeded. This is, to my knowledge, only the second time that a topic has become so prevalent as to require this drastic intervention. However, this is not r/changemytransview. This is r/changemyview. If you are interested in reading arguments related to transgender topics, we truly have a thorough and complete treatment of the topic in this subreddit's history.

# The Rule

Pursuant to Rule 4, any thread that touches on transgender issues, even tangentially, will be removed by the automoderator. Attempts to circumvent automoderation will not be treated lightly by the moderation team, as they are indicative of a disdain for our rules. If you don't know enough to avoid the topic and violate our rules, that's not that big of a deal. If you know enough to try to evade the automoderator, that shows a deliberate intent to thwart our rules. Please do not attempt to avoid this rule.

# Conclusion

The moderation team regrets deeply that this decision has been necessary. We will answer any questions in this thread, or in r/ideasforcmv. We will not entertain discussion of this policy in unrelated topics. We will not grant exceptions to this rule. We may revisit this rule if circumstances change. We are unlikely to revisit this rule for at least six months.

Sincerely,

The moderators of r/changemyview",LucidLeviathan,373,1910,0.6200000047683716,0.4435846102281652,1694636928,/r/changemyview/comments/16hxvf8/meta_transgender_topics/,2023,9
16tvzqy,CMV: The U.S. Government Should not be Allowed to Shut Down.,"Typically when an indispensable group of people have an upcoming deadline, they are expected to work day and night on a solution.  Instead, members of congress were sent home. 

This should not be an acceptable outcome.  Those in high levels of office should be expected to work as long as it takes until a solution is reached.  It is unacceptable for the ineptitude of 535 people to shut down an entity employing millions, forcing federal employees to go without pay.  

There should be harsh consequences for allowing this to happen. Members of congress should not be able to adjourn until a solution is reached, and those who choose to leave Washington during important negotiations should forfeit their right to participate in all future discussions.  If there is to be a shutdown, Congress should be expected to work day and night until a budget is passed. 

As a side note, it is also absurd that members of Congress continue to be paid when there is a shutdown, but I can accept that risking loss of pay might force people to make hasty decisions and so changing this would do more harm than good.",CabalRamona,1859,579,0.9399999976158142,0.3435620488346615,1695848626,/r/changemyview/comments/16tvzqy/cmv_the_us_government_should_not_be_allowed_to/,2023,9

16t2565,"CMV: I plan on voting for a Biden presidency for 2024, for those people that are voting for Trump, can you explain why you think a Trump presidency would be better for the country. Aside from Age or health, purely policy points.","I feel like Trump is an overwhelmingly alienating figure that's purely guided by his ego and the crowd's cheers. I don't think he has any ideological integrity and the majority of his policy is just to be contrarian for the sake of being a contrarian. A lot of his policies seem to be hard-set on nationalism and isolationism while throwing scapegoats under the bus as a rallying cry without actually addressing the issue. Things like threatening to leave NATO, his policy towards Ukraine, and starting the trade war with China. He's undoubtedly left a negative impression with our allies (setting tariffs on Germany and the UK) and generally being a joke amongst their citizens.

I'm not completely against everything he did during his presidency, like trying to get NATO allies to spend more on defense or restructuring NAFTA. But, things like constantly using an us vs them mentality has really divided people, not to mention encouraging rumors like Qanon or his poor response to rioters (the capital included). He seems have little to no mind for compromise and completely disregards moderate/bipartisan policy. He's done tremendous damage towards our institutions, things like going after the director of the FBI and undermining the authority of the NHS despite having never taken an upper level biology course. He doesn't even seem to be a republican, just a reactionary populist, while spending money on ridiculous ventures.

This is not to say I'm happy with Biden, in fact I'm not voting for Biden for Biden, but for the administration behind him. Even if they have to keep him in a hibernation tank between speeches, I'd rather have the policy of that administration over a guy that tries to purge federal bodies and pack it with loyalist yes men. I don't even blame Trump for how the pandemic was handled, I don't think any leader (Hillary included) would have produced any significantly better results and feel the same about the economy now. Sure it's sluggish and the fed is still trying to control prices, but that's the boom and bust of the market, he would have the same outcome. If Biden were reelected, I think it would be significantly better for workers rights, not to mention set up the infrastructure for energy independence.

169vziy,"CMV: If you wear MAGA swag, chances are you’re an asshole.","Not saying all Trump voters are assholes (I know many, including in my family, who are great people.) 

But if you believe in Trump’s message so fervently that you’d deck yourself out in Trump/MAGA iconography, it’s more likely than not that you’re probably a dickhead who believes in the worst, most emotive parts of his message. 

Many republicans/independents voted for him the past two elections either because he was the closest one to their position, not necessarily because they liked him. More of an anti-Democrat, pro-Republican vote than a pro-Trump vote.  If you’re sporting the red hat, or the bumper sticker, or have the flag pinned up somewhere though, it likely indicates that you’re a fan of the man himself, and by extension the more venomous elements of his platform (rabid anti-immigration in particular), rather than just lowering taxes. 

Totally open to changing my mind on this - I know that probably the counter-evidence would be anecdotal in nature and that’s fine (seeing as how my argument is based on anecdotal evidence as well - ive yet to come across a MAGA-branded person who, accounting for my own bias, wasnt a prickly cunt).

It’s not good enough, though, to just say “My dad is a good man and he loves Trump and wears the hat” - many racists/assholes/fuckheads are great with their family and neighbours. You’d have to show that they wear that shit *and* don’t subscribe to the shittiest parts of Trumpworld (I suppose you can try to argue that supporting something like family separations doesn’t make you an asshole, but I would disagree).

16wfk2f,CMV: I am a 16 year old Incel who believes he will always be single and wants to change his toxic and misogynistic views on women and dating and let go of my resentment and envy.,"\[Last post got removed due to title not being descriptive enough or something. I got permission from mods for a repost\]  
I dont even know where to start. I decided to make this post because school has started again and I often see people my age and even younger kissing and dating and it upsets me so much. and I dont have anyone to turn to and ask for advice.  
I am 16 years old and havent even kissed a girl yet. I know people say i am too young to worry about that but im sick of it. so many people have sex and date in their teens when they are around my age and when they are even younger. the average age here in the UK is just 16!  
and people all over other places like the usa also have sex and date and it just kills me to know that so many people are easily able to experience what I struggle with so much.  
I fucking hate it when family members, friends, and coworkers ask about who im dating. i hate it so much. I overheard 2 women in a store talk about their sons and one of them said their 13 year old son is a big boy and already has a girlfriend. fuck that just made me seethe so much with envy.  
I have discovered the incel movement and couldnt help but sympathize with them. and I dont mean the psychopathic murderous things. I dont wish harm on anyone.  
Women/girls are the choosers and they always seem to choose some of the douchiest, stupidest, biggest fucking losers and its hard to respect women because of it. its why i have grown to resent them. Some of the girls i have known have cried and complained to their friends how their boyfriend left them, cheated, or doesnt give them much attention. girls for some reason, always seem to go for the brutes that really dont care about them.  
and I wanna make it clear I do not think I am entitled to anything (gosh i despise it when people just throw that word at us). I just feel envious and perplexed at how guys, including some of biggest jerks, easily get girlfriends while i am stuck with my hand and virtual girls. it feels so pathetic.  
I hate having desires to kiss and date girls. if i could turn gay or get rid of these desires i would in an instant. so many guys seem to take it for granted. it seems amazing to be able to hold hands, kiss, and even have sex with girls. girls are just pretty.  
There was this senior girl I had a HUGE crush on. When I walked past her I heard her talking with a friend about her having sex with a guy at her house and how he said he loved her neck.  
I later found out it was this fucking nerdy looking freshman. I saw them kissing outside of school and then I found out she slept with other guys. Before graduation, I planned to ask her out or try to flirt with her and I did but guess what? she fucking rejected me.  
The dudes she slept with werent even anything special. They werent in some band, or in the sports team, nor were they talented or rich.  
yet this fucking loose, shameless, disgraceful, skank of a whore still chose to have sex with these absolute losers.  
as much as i wanna have sex with one, I would happy with just kissing and dating. some of the things i wanna do is take a girl out to a very fun place like a bowling alley, zoo, a carnival, or an aquarium and see sharks and sea lions or even take her to eat ice cream with me at a park. i wanna have fun and live a normal teenage life but i cant because the universe seems to fucking cuck me so much. Girls seem so dirty and horny as guys yet none of them are ever interested in me. NONE. its like im destined to stay single and a virgin.  
not only do i feel pathetic and less of a man and human being in general for not being able to do what billions of people have done and what millions of people, including teens are doing as we speak, but i feel like theres such a void in me that i cant fill. i just wanna cuddle and kiss with a girl who likes me back but none of them do.  
i dont wanna date and have sex when im older. it seems boring and much less fun because you have much less free time and grownups seem so miserable all the time. i wanna do it now that im still young and have lots of free time and energy.  
Plus, I know that not ALL girls are shallow or like toxic assholes. but the ones that dont are always taken. all the good, smart, beautiful girls always have boyfriends.",_Furry_Potato_,645,1055,0.6600000262260437,0.29758803195613787,1696102207,/r/changemyview/comments/16wfk2f/cmv_i_am_a_16_year_old_incel_who_believes_he_will/,2023,9
16kcvv6,"CMV: it is morally and logically inconsistent to advocate for two murder charges in the event of the homocide of a pregnant woman, and to be believe that abortion should be legal at the same time","

So, I’m not against abortion  and I’m certainly not defending murderers of pregnant women, I just think this is an interesting test for moral consistency. Also, moral tests are inherently not easy situations, so there’s gonna be an outcome that feels shitty to a lot of people if moral consistency is achieved in this case, at least in my view. I’ve realized this also applies to cases where miscarriage is brought on by physical violence, I’m not gonna edit the whole thing to say that but just know that it is is included in every point unless it’s specifically about abortion. And to clarify, in this case I’m obviously not saying it’s morally inconsistent to charge the person who violently caused the miscarriage with *any* crime, just the murder of the fetus. 

I think it’s pretty simple reasoning: if someone believes the murderer should get an additional charge for the death of the fetus, that means the fetus should be classified as a human being in the eyes of the law. If someone gets an abortion the fetus goes from being alive to being dead, if a fetus is classified as a human being, there’s no reason this shouldn’t count as a murder. In fact, it seems like it would fit the criteria of solicitation of murder, with the mother (and anyone else who supported the abortion) being the solicitor, and the doctor who performed the operation (along with anyone who willfully aided specifically the abortion) being the actual murderer. To claim that it’s different when the mother does it while carrying the child would mean that the perpetrator of a killing determines whether it is lawful or murder. Apply this to self defense and it gets… real bad real quick. I understand that there is a difference, that difference being that the mother is carrying the fetus in the womb, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a human life being killed, if we accept that premise from the charges of murder for the fetus.",LEMO2000,283,1208,0.6899999976158142,0.2861896257610093,1694884829,/r/changemyview/comments/16kcvv6/cmv_it_is_morally_and_logically_inconsistent_to/,2023,9
16f3ker,CMV: Writing a letter to a judge as a character reference does not imply you don't believe someone did the bad thing they were convicted of,"This is spurred by the backlash to Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis writing letters as a character reference for Danny Masterson, but it can be applied to many things. 

People convicted of many crimes have others write character references to the judge prior to sentencing, and I don't believe that when that happens they necessarily think the person is innocent.  They are speaking to how they know them outside of the crime committed.  All this is so the judge can get a better picture of the person outside of the crime they have been convicted of and that can influence sentencing.   But at no point is that saying the person is innocent. 

I feel like a lot of the flak Ashton and Mila received is a bit unfair.   They were asked to do this as people who have known him for 20+ years.  They could have said no of course, but he was already going to jail for some period of time.   It didn't say he was innocent.  It didn't say they didn't believe the women who accused him.  All it said was that ""this is the person I know and this is what he did for me"".  

If you feel that these character references have no place in the justice system, that is fine.  But I think being upset that people write them at the request of lawyers is a bit much. 

I also feel that many people would do the same for someone they have known for 20+ years, and people are being a bit hypocritical.    I know if my little brother or close friend committed a crime and was going to jail, it would be hard for me to refuse to do it, even if I agree that they deserve to go to jail.",illini02,777,849,0.7099999785423279,0.27037218795491724,1694360865,/r/changemyview/comments/16f3ker/cmv_writing_a_letter_to_a_judge_as_a_character/,2023,9
16n2hy7,CMV: The only way someone can believe in a religion like Christianity is if they deliberately hold it to a much lower standard of evidence than they hold everything else.,"Most people who are religious practice perfectly sound judgment and fact-based assessment in most other aspects of their life. 

For instance, if you were a car dealer and you tried to sell a Toyota to a Christian, saying, *""This Camry can give you 300 miles per gallon,""* that Christian wouldn't believe it - and rightfully so. The Christian would demand, ""Give me a tremendous amount of evidence before I'll believe such a wild claim."" 

Same if a finance manager told a religious client, ""*Give me $10,000 today and I'll invest it and make it become $1 million in five years.""* The religious person would be rightfully skeptical. That sort of return on one's money would be well-nigh impossible, barring all but the most extreme circumstances or massive fraud.

Yet somehow, when it comes to all the far-fetched claims - that the Red Sea were literally divided in two so people could walk on dry land, that a Flood drowned all humans save eight but also that animals walked pair by pair into the Ark (including several million species of insects and spiders as well - imagine that), that dead people can resurrect, that Jesus was God Himself on Earth.........many Christians believe those to have literally have happened as well. (Yes, I know, not all are Biblical literalists, but many are.)

Then the only logical way to describe this is that these people hold their own religion to a much looser, lower standard of evidence than they demand of everything else. They hold everything else to a strict standard but hold their religion to a loose standard. (Except for religious people who are also conspiracy-theorist quacks - they hold *everything* to a loose standard.)

16w65yu,"CMV: Gun violence in the United States will continue to increase, and there is nothing we can do.","My argument is basically a two-point case. I believe the following:

1. Gun control will never be passed in the United States at a federal level, which is the only way it could work, because otherwise someone truly determined to commit a mass shooting can just go to a neighboring state with more lax gun laws.
2. Even if gun control were passed on a federal level, it wouldn't work.

POINT 1: 

Look, it's no secret that the massacres keep happening more and more frequently. I tend to agree with that British journalist who said that Sandy Hook was the end of the gun control debate. Gun violence has gone from a generation-defining tragedy to something that happens every day in America. Events like Uvalde that remain in the news for a few weeks are the exception, not the rule. Plus, the general public seems to care less and less about the fact that the US is a total warzone. As an example, Greg Abbott, a very pro-gun violence politician, won 60 percent in the vote in Uvalde County even after the Robb Elementary massacre. Other countries have started putting travel warnings against the US, and still nothing ever changes even as our foreign relations suffer. I don't have any serious expectation that things will change enough for gun control to be passed federally. However, that's not even the biggest obstacle to putting an end to this plague.

POINT 2:

To those who would say that other countries have solved this problem, I'm not going to deny that. However, Canada, Australia, Germany, and other countries never had the same gun culture that we did. The US has twice as many guns per capita as fucking YEMEN. If gun control were passed tomorrow, I expect gun sales to massively increase the way they do after every high-profile mass shooting. The Second Amendment people will say ""They're trying to take our guns!"" and they'll arm up even further. Even if that doesn't happen, there are still too many guns floating around, so the only real solution is for the government to forcibly confiscate them, which would probably end in even more violence. *Even in the best-case scenario, gun violence would continue, it just wouldn't increase as exponentially as it is right now.*

16u7f78,CMV: the expansion of NATO is NOT what prompted Russia to invade Ukraine,"More specifically, my current position is that the expansion of NATO would have been an insignificant factor in the decision to invade, even if it did enter into a cost-benefit analysis. 

My reasoning for holding this belief is that:

1) NATO's expansion was not carried out actively or with aggressive intentions, but was a passive process of allowing countries in central and eastern Europe to join, due to their own security concerns. It is unlikely that the Kremlin could have seriously perceived this as a threat, since NATO is fundamentally not a war-mongering organisation, and would only ever engage in *retaliatory* combat.

2) Invading Ukraine would have been an idiotic - indeed nonsensical response, if it *was* a reaction to the NATO threat; and I don't think it's plausible that Putin and his advisors could have gotten it so wrong. Here's why it doesn't make sense:

* It always ran a significant risk of strengthening NATO (which it in fact has)
* Since the Crimea annexation, it has driven Ukraine further into the arms of the west (since they rightfully fear for their own security)
* A diplomatic approach to wooing Ukraine would have been feasible (since a majority of Ukrainians were against joining NATO prior to the Crimea annexation)
* Supposing Russia is successful in claiming Ukraine - this doesn't really help their security situation anyway; they are still directly adjacent to NATO countries.

A secondary belief, which you can engage with or not, is that the main driving force was Putin's personal desire for glory and respect, and to leave a Peter-the-Great-like legacy. I don't hold this view very strongly - so I'll also give deltas to anyone who can provide convincing arguments that it *is* correct.",CaptainQueero,479,843,0.7400000095367432,0.233430432368346,1695878942,/r/changemyview/comments/16u7f78/cmv_the_expansion_of_nato_is_not_what_prompted/,2023,9
16sssne,CMV: The Ukraine war shows that the much-hated military-industrial complex is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have.,"Few industries are despised more in the West than the military-industrial complex. Prior to the Ukraine war, progressive politicians (and some conservatives as well) constantly railed against the defense industry, questioning why the United States was spending $800 billion a year on the military when that money could have gone towards \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert your cause of choice: education, healthcare, social cause, etc.) instead. Western European nations, by and large, spent relatively little on defense (despite a NATO pledge for each member to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense). When you asked liberal voters what government item they wanted the most to see big budget cuts on, they would almost invariably say the military.

But the Ukraine war suddenly changed the tunes of many such folks. The same folks who decried the billions of dollars spent on weaponry production suddenly fretted about whether the U.S. would be able to manufacture enough 155mm artillery shells in time to assist Ukraine. The same people who thought of the U.S. defense industry as a useless pit for taxpayer dollars to be wasted now complain that we're not sending enough Abrams tanks, ATACMS, Javelins, Stingers or F-16s to Ukraine. The Daily Kos, a very left-leaning publication, has suddenly featured numerous pro-Ukraine articles detailing the need for U.S. military support of Ukraine and the amount of such.

And not to take anything away from the courage and ingenuity of the Ukrainians, who have fought more bravely and cleverly than perhaps any nation we've seen in decades, but it can clearly be seen that if it weren't for the massive amount of Western military assistance that had been given to Ukraine in the form of artillery (Ukraine was on pace to run out of its small Soviet-type artillery arsenal a year ago,) intelligence, portable anti-tank and anti-air missiles, anti-air defense (Kyiv and other major cities were repeatedly vulnerable to Russian air attacks until recently, when Western Gepards/NASAMS/Patriot/IRIS-T arrived), Ukraine would be in a far worse position than it is today. None of that would have been possible without a substantial military-industrial complex in the West.

You can't get this sort of thing on short notice. If the West had neglected defense and a war like the Ukraine conflict had broken out, it would have been impossible to spool up in time. Modern advanced military systems take years to develop. 

All of this shows is that the defense industry of the West - particularly the United States' - is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have. The whole point of a military is similar to that of the function of a fire department - it's not something you **want** to have to use, but you need it to be there for emergencies. (Assuming your military is used for defense, not offense, of course.) Furthermore, the same progressives who complain about $800 billion spent on the military often overlook the fact that the United States spends far **more** than that on healthcare, Medicare, Social Security every year. The military is actually a relatively small component of the U.S. federal budget.

Of course, there are major issues with over-pricing and bloat in the U.S. defense industry (there's no excuse for F-35 development and production to have been the SNAFU that it was,) and much reform is needed. But the Ukraine war has shown that a military-industrial complex is something people like to hate in peacetime, but learn to grasp the value of in wartime.

16sc1lv,CMV: Police should have to be exemplary members of society and constantly abide by the law or lose their job.,"This isn't a debate on law breaking or if its ever ok. It's calling out the double standards of law enforcement.

Everyone can agree that police should at minimum have sound judgement, not be racist, as well as be trusted to protect and serve their community.

Unfortunately that's not common enough. But let's not stop there.

How many cops have you seen driving around on their cell phones? Speeding without their lights on? Illegally parked and not on a call? Making illegal uturns? Expecting free/ discounted food? When I worked in customer service I even had a cop have a tantrum that I couldn't give them the police discount when they were off the clock (I recognized them, as they were a regular)

Yet when starving, hungry people steal food they throw the book at them and put them in jail. They park where nobody else is allowed to park looking for others speeding, when that's all they do all day. Giving tickets for not stopping long enough for right on red and they don't even brake at the red light when nobody's coming. Etc. But it's a hell worthy offense if anyone else does any of this.

Imo an officer should have a dashcam on them at all times in addition to body cams. If they're speeding with no cause, they lose their job. Riding around holding their cellphones? No job. Any offense they ticket others for, if they are caught doing it, no job.

They can't even follow the law and they're supposed to enforce it? The hypocritical cops should just get fired. If they don't care enough about the law to follow it themselves they need to find a new line of work.",JollyMcStink,900,406,0.9100000262260437,0.19257975277515144,1695696792,/r/changemyview/comments/16sc1lv/cmv_police_should_have_to_be_exemplary_members_of/,2023,9
169zp5h,CMV: Involuntary treatment of psychiatric medication makes me very uncomfortable,"So as a psychiatric patient of over 8 years who has been on several medicines, I have experienced some unpleasant side effects. I have also been involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. I was also administered medication against my will because of my severe mental health issues. This bothers me because these medications cause nasty side effects and psychiatrists, PAs, and NPs have the nerve to gaslight patients into taking their medication. Gaslighting is a separate topic but ties into this. Apparently doctors can gaslight psychiatric patients into taking medications by saying...

&#x200B;

>You're mentally ill. You think the medications are poisonous and you are agitated. This proves that you are mentally ill and cannot think rationally to make your own decisions about medication.

Therapists also gaslight their patients but again, this is a separate issue. The idea that you can be given medication whether you like it or not is bothersome. There always need to be informed consent to treatment. Coercion and force is an abuse of power that makes patients distrustful towards their healthcare providers. We don't advocate for coercion or force when it comes to sex, then why not medication treatment? 

Psychiatrists also threaten patients into an *alternative outpatient treatment center* to ensure compliance. This again is bothersome since a patient should have the right to refuse any treatment, especially in outpatient settings. Why do we have court ordered mandates and alternative outpatient treatment centers for psychiatry but not other disciplines?

I live in MN with some of the worst winter's in the country, so while I appreciate the need for all-wheel drive, I know with certainty it's not an absolute need. And if it is for the rare case, most families have 2 vehicles, other another SUV with AWD capabilities.

Most American families live in the suburbs and do not go off-road. The purchase of an SUV is therefor mostly for show. Minivans sit as high as SUVs, so sight is not an issue. The carrying capacity of minivans is equal to or greater than most SUVs. The gas mileage is equal to or better. The technology and safety features are equal to or exceed SUVs. The ""styling"" or ""craftsmanship"" is, to me, a dubious excuse due to the following: the only thing most SUVs for families has over a minivan is simply a reputation. So, I beleive most families purchase an SUV to impress others or signal a status to other people.

16tmynl,CMV: You did not defend or protect our country if you have served in the American armed forces in the last 80 years,"Let me quickly get this out of the way: I am an American, and anyone who enlists in the armed forces has my respect, as they are committing to a profession that is hard, dangerous, and often scary. They put more on the line than I ever will in my career...

That being said, I pity our armed forces. Anyone who says that our veterans and active duty personnel ""fought for or protected our country"" is lying to themselves. There has not been a direct threat to America since WW2. I respect the hell out of WW2 vets, for example, as they put their lives on the line to truly protect their country, democracy, and human rights.

But since then, any conflict America has been in were conflicts they arguably shouldn't have stuck their nose in. Whether they were trying to make a statement, were overblowing the threat, or were using it as an excuse for some alternative motive, they were all conflicts that posed little to no threat to America.

Anyways, this post isn't about whether we should or shouldn't have been involved. It's about how I pity our armed forces, as they have been brainwashed to believe they are ""protecting and defending out country"" when, in reality, they are putting their lives on the line just to be a pawn for what the USA wants to do. The military masks the reality with patriotism, selflessness, and the call to duty. This is all bull shit meant to appeal to men and women who are easily persuaded and have few options for their future. (i.e. Living in a small town with no career opportunities, or unable to attend higher education after high school, or people who seek a ""purpose"")

It just makes me sick seeing the military commercials or ROTC recruitment at high schools. They are so blatantly trying to appeal to kids who don't know better, making them feel important by throwing around words like ""patriotism"" and ""duty"" and ""a higher calling."" It's all BS, no different than a cult who recruits their members by telling them exactly what they want to hear even if it's a lie. They are giving these kids a fake purpose just so that they will make sacrifices to accomplish their greedy ambitions. 

It's so messed up and I wonder why no one else sees through it. We blindly praise veterans and active duty personnel for their service, when, in reality, I don't think their service is anything I should be thanking them for. The only people who should be thanking them are the higher ups who gain from their sacrifices.

It knows how unpopular it is, so it plays the long game. It buys influence. It gerrymanders. It stacks courts with its own decision-makers. It closely examines the rules and plays them in ways unanticipated. It uses religion (A tool built to cement power.

16mnb8a,CMV: Millennials and Gen Z are Screwed. Perhaps Irredeemably So...,"In the past decade and a half, the media has been full of stories about how [entitled](https://incafrica.com/ryan-jenkins/this-is-why-millennials-are-entitled.html), [lazy](https://africa.businessinsider.com/careers/gen-z-workers-are-lazy-some-bosses-say-they-dont-do-anything-unless-every-second-of/57pqptd) and unambitious the millennials and gen z cohort are. I do not believe this is entirely accurate for the following reasons:

1. **Academic Inflation (Modern Job Market > Kumite) :** The increased number of kids going to college has been a double edged sword. On one hand, the increased amount of college educated kids means that we have a more sceptical and literate populations which may be good for society. However, while research does seem to suggest that Gen-Z and Millennials are by some metrics the [most educated generation in many countries history's](https://www.businessinsider.in/policy/economy/news/millennials-have-struggled-to-find-well-paid-jobs-despite-being-the-most-educated-generation-its-because-there-are-more-college-degrees-but-fewer-jobs-that-require-them-/articleshow/93913920.cms), it also means that there is suddenly an abundant supply of talent for companies. And all of this ignores the effects of automation, introduction of minorities into the workforce and immigration. The end result of this process is academic inflation which that it has gotten a lot more difficult for the young to secure [jobs](https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/gen-z-set-more-qualified-29264859). Most people that know a Millennial/Gen Z have probably heard of one horror story of how tough it seems to be to get into employment in the modern job market. I believe that this situation is unsalvageable because increasingly we start to see power law distributions being caused by a Matthew effect (i.e. Those lucky enough to gain experience are hounded for jobs while those without are stuck in a loop in which they become more and more undesirable as candidates.) 
2. **Wage Stagnation (Where'd All The Good Jobs Go?):** Following up on my previous point of there being an oversupply of labour, companies have felt no real incentive to hike wages to keep talent. If talent is no longer scarce and can be obtained for cheap due to market . All this has been going on while the cost of living has been on the rise making it a lot [harder](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/wages-have-fallen-43-for-millennials-no-wonder-they-ve-lost-hope/) for people working in these positions to keep up with the cost of living. 
3. **Climate Change (Don't Look Up...No Really):** This one is a lot more controversial. It is well known that our climate is changing. Most of this change is being driven by human activity and is set to have [devastating effects](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/harvard-experts-discuss-climate-change-fears/) on life as we know it unless something is done about it. However, most big polluters seem [disinterested in slowing down](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/china-avoids-climate-change-discussion-despite-extreme-weather-2023-08-11/) any pollution efforts if it comes at the cost of their prosperity. Such trends mean that short of a string of very successful scientific breakthroughs, the younger generation seems condemned to live in a world that has far less habitable land area and more susceptible to extreme events. Geoengineering remains a deeply controversial area of research [for many reasons](https://time.com/6264143/geoengineering-climate-scientists-divided/). If things remain as they are, it means we are only left with few other alternatives, the main one being, accept that the situation is irreversible (at least for now,) and buck up and take it.
4. **Sex Recession (An Indicator of Deeper Problems)**: It has been discovered that [marriage](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/does-marriage-make-you-happier/675145/) provides human beings with happiness that is unsurpassed by very few things. This is yet another facet of life in which Millennials/Gen-Zs have been caught lacking by circumstances outside of their control. Due to some of the reasons mentioned above and a lot more that I have left out of this argument, [younger folks are not marrying](https://sundial.csun.edu/168571/print-editions/fact-check-why-younger-generations-are-saying-i-dont/) at the same rates or even showing any interest in performing acts that would make it easier to have a family [(such as engaging in sexual activity.](https://nypost.com/2023/06/01/gen-z-is-having-a-sex-recession-and-here-are-the-reasons-why/)) The impact (and presence, frankly) of hook-up culture has largely been [overblown by the media](https://time.com/88092/hookup-culture-myth-study/) and current statistics show that Gen-Z/Millennials [have a lot less bedroom traffic than their predecessors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2016/08/16/millennials-are-having-less-sex-than-other-gens-but-experts-say-its-probably-fine/?sh=4bc66ee6d958). As [Japan](https://www.newsweek.com/japan-population-decline-births-deaths-demographics-society-1796496), [South Korea](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Work/South-Korea-looks-to-foreign-workers-to-solve-demographic-crisis) and even [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/upshot/china-population-decline.html) will tell you, this is a very difficult trend to reverse. Once men and women are not interested in coming together and starting families, population collapse is almost a certainty.

To end I wish to give the definition of the word, ""entitled"" which is ""Believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment."" From this information, it would seem that such a label cannot apply to Millennials and Gen-Z.  In the words of John Burn-Murdoch, chief data reporter for the Financial Times, ""They have done everything they were told to do, yet the fruits of their labours are proving elusive.""",Zero-zero20,534,448,0.8100000023841858,0.15751934727037153,1695119280,/r/changemyview/comments/16mnb8a/cmv_millennials_and_gen_z_are_screwed_perhaps/,2023,9

16faldm,"CMV: the federal and state governments going after DJT is a good thing, and in general the USA needs to continue its strong stance on election denial.","On the fact of it, the Biden administration has essentially been at a legal and ideological war with a large portion of the right, but what really justifies it for me is the why. 

Biden started off this battle by being brutally honest with the American people. He made it very clear that anyone who denies elections poses a serious threat ar to the USA by doing so. A good American accepts the results of elections; they don’t deny them. We can disagree on the big issues, but you’re not a good American if you deny that the election was fair *without proof*. And I think Biden emphasized that point perfectly. If you’re an American who denies elections, American is just a description of your passport, not who you are. An American who *didn’t* have contempt for everything that we stand for would not deny elections, again, without proof, and **especially** they would not deny their elections in an illegal manner.

Of course, words should be backed by actions, and, while of course Biden can’t charge anybody, his DOJ has done a great job cracking down on election denial when it’s done in an illegal manner. For example, the DOJ has arrested multiple people on Jan 6 charges and while most are under-sentenced, it sends a good message. Same with the Jan 6 charges related to Trump and charges related to asking Georgia to overturn their election. The government has done a good job of letting the good people know that election deniers will not be tolerated. The best way to stop election denial is to absolutely crack down on it. With the Trump arrests and most importantly the Jan 6 arrests, the government has let it be known that we will *not* let election deniers harm the very fabric of this country. 

Now, to be fair, I’m not saying we can’t complain about the electoral process itself.

I accept that many Americans are perfectly sincere in this belief, but that doesn't make it true. **Most Americans** are richer than ever, and richer than most people in the world. The evidence shows that they consume more than ever, \[live in bigger homes, etc\](https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/housing/). Most of the people complaining are objectively some of the luckiest people in world history, and the rest of the world is tired of their narcissistic whining. There are lots of actually poor people in the world  (and even in America itself) who deserve our sympathy and help far more.  
  
2 Counter-arguments I reject  
  
**1. Prices have increased therefore Americans are poor (e.g. recent post-Covid inflation; long run increases in house prices, university tuition, health care. )**  
  
I don't deny that prices for many things have increased in recent decades, and this reduces the amount of those things that people can buy. However, this does not necessarily mean that Americans are objectively poor, or poorer than they used to be. Price changes are a normal part of economic development (e.g. as an economy gets richer, food and manufactured goods get cheaper in hours of work you have to put in to get them, while labour-intensive services like education automatically get more expensive). When prices for certain things increase, people have to make trade-offs they didn't have to before, and this may feel unpleasant because they can't have everything they thought they could have (or exactly what their parents had). But they can still buy plenty of nice things, including functional substitutes that are much better than what their parents had.  
  
**2. Inequality: America is rich, but the top 1% took it all**  
  
It is true that poor people in America are poorer than poor people in other rich countries because the US has unusually high level of income inequality. So I don't deny that **some** Americans are poor. But not most Americans, or the average American, which is the claim I see constantly.  
  
I also don't deny that a disproportionate share of the economic gains of the last 40 years have accrued to the already rich, or that social mobility in the US has declined. One can certainly complain that this is **unfair**, and that the average American would be even richer if economic policies had been different. But that imaginary counterfactual doesn't mean that Americans in general are actually poor against any reasonable benchmark, whether that be meeting their basic needs; the rest of the world; or Americans from previous generations.",phileconomicus,64,650,0.5600000023841858,0.143420727467371,1694874482,/r/changemyview/comments/16k8wdg/cmv_americans_are_not_as_poor_as_they_think_they/,2023,9
169qn9x,CMV: Politicians should be subject to perjury as a part of their official duties.,"Politicians can have an incredible effect on the lives of people in the country, whether those people are constiuients or otherwise.

When politicians can knowingly lie without fear of consequences it creates a rift on uncertainty and inherent mistrust between the Civil Servant and the people they represent.

I believe that a sworn in Politician who at any time they are acting in an official capacity should be subject to perjury charges if it can be shown that they knowingly lied.

My first thought regarding this is freedom of speech of the politician, however there is already a precedent for temporary removal of that right with members of the Armed Forces, so I don't see why Politicians can't have a similar requirement.

""United States v. Caldwell, 75 M.J. 276 (in the context of freedom of speech in the military, servicemembers do not possess the same broad rights of expression that civilians enjoy; this principle holds true even in regard to interactions between superiors and subordinates).""

I don't think this can be applied to Canidates prior to being sworn in as they haven't yet made an Oath of Office.

16cj4ib,CMV: Most people's religious beliefs are largely influenced by their societal and familial upbringing rather than a personal search for truth,"I've been thinking a lot about the influence of culture and family on our personal beliefs, especially in the realm of religion. It seems to me that the majority of people tend to follow the religion of their parents or the dominant religion of the region they grew up in. For instance, someone born in a predominantly Christian region might naturally grow up with Christian beliefs, while someone born in the Middle East might be more likely to adopt Islamic beliefs.

While I acknowledge that many individuals do undergo personal spiritual journeys and might change their beliefs over time, I can't help but think that for a significant portion of the global population, religious beliefs are more a product of upbringing and societal constructs than personal exploration.

16q2x1q,"CMV: All schools should have a mandatory subject about ''after school life'' which cover topics such as student loans, politics and basic law/rights.","The reason for a CMV about this is because to me this sounds like it's obviously a good thing and should most definitely be done, but I'm also fairly certain that there's a reason it's not. I just can't think of a *good* reason as to why it isn't compulsory other than the education system as a whole is outdated and needs an overhaul but it doesn't happen for whatever reason. I don't know too much about this, so excuse the ignorance.   


A subject like this should be compulsory for all students, but passing/failing it has no impact on whether or not they pass school. It should however impact whether or not they're able to apply for a student loan. If they're unable to pass a basic test about how student loans work and what they'll end up paying and the laws about it, then they simply should not be able to get it. It seems irresponsible to have an 18 year old kid take out a contract like that without them understanding the basics of it.   


Other topics covered by this subject should include stuff like basic politics and how the political system works. The consequence for failing this part should be that they're unable to vote ( or at least unable to until a certain age ) with the ability to retake the test as many times as they want, at no cost. I understand some people would strongly disagree with this because they may feel like it's some kind of discrimination and I imagine these would be the same type of people who disagree with voters requiring ID, but I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of people would agree to this. Oh, and also a government ID should be issued to them too at school. Absolutely no reason to not have one. I'm from South Africa and got my ID in grade 10. And if a country like that can get this right, I see no reason for a ''first world'' country to mess it up.   


Of course, this isn't a perfect list of topics that ''should'' be covered, but this is a rough idea on my thoughts. Nitpicking at an oversight or tiny detail is not going to change my view, rather fault the idea itself. The reason I believe this to be the right thing to do has nothing to do with discriminating against illiterate people or people one might believe to be stupid, it is simply there to help someone better understand the world they're stepping into. Failing to understand the basics of something like a loan should be viewed in the same way as failing to understand the contract you're signing where it says '' sign here to  confirm you understand the T&C '', except that this is a test to ensure that you do actually understand the basics of the T&C's

This will surely ruffle a few feathers but I really am wanting to understand how someone with a different perspective than me would respond to this. 

In the US, it is legal to have differing views on religion and to not be religious at all. A Christian cannot be forced to be atheist just like an atheist cannot be forced to be Christian. Everyone should be entitled to their own beliefs. 
So that being said, if it is a Christian’s belief that abortion is murder (and this belief is usually heavily rooted in religion) but a non Christian believes that abortion is not murder, why is there a need to create a law that heavily aligns with the Christian side? If we want to create a land where everyone feels accepted regardless of what religious views they hold, what need is there for a law that only agrees with specific religious groups? 

I’d also like to add I know not all Christians are pro life and not all non-christians are pro choice. This is just a common trend I’ve seen on the media and I want to understand an outside perspective. 

I guess I find abolishing abortion somewhat ironic. Someone who is christian and pro life should absolutely be accepted for who they are and that belief.

16ii0kt,CMV: Bad moms don't deserve their child's forgiveness and their presence in their lives,"Even if they change later in life, what happened can't be erased and they basically ruined a huge part of their child's life. 

I know there might be a debate about what a ""bad mom"" is. I would say that if a person considers that their mom played a big part in their unhappiness during their childhood/teenagehood then she is to be considered a bad mom. 

My mom is definitely one of them and I don't think she deserves to have a good relationship with me today, or any relationship at all. 

Around the age of 11 she stopped being affectionate with me. No more hugs, no more kisses, no more cute nicknames, no more good nights in bed.

In middle school, she would criticize my only friend and call her weird, and told me I was becoming weird like her (I became insecure)

She called me an idiot very regularly during that period, compared me to others, belittled me.

She constantly criticized and judged my personality, the way I ate, the way I spoke, the way I behaved, what I talked about, the fact that I was close to my friends...

She wasn't the type of mom who talked to me, asked me how my day was at school, laughed with me, was affectionate, smiled at me... when she spoke to me it was only criticism and negativity.

She was always grumpy and moody. I very rarely saw her smile at home and she always looked at me with side eyes and disgust when I passed in the living room. Because of that, I stayed in my room a lot and almost never spoke to her. She blamed me a lot for that.

I wasn't allowed to invite friends. I wasn't allowed to go to my friends' houses. I wasn't allowed to go out with friends after school, on weekends or during vacations even when I was 20 (or even alone, I never went out except to go to school). I wasn't allowed to have a phone or wear makeup until I was 18. She never gave me money so I couldn't buy anything on my own until I was 18 when I was finally financially independent. I was never allowed to cut my hair. I wasn't allowed to dye my hair either. I wasn't allowed to go to parties even when I was in college. I wasn't allowed to have a boyfriend, especially if he wasn't Muslim. My life was just school and home, I could only go out with my older sister or my mom and my aunt. I would do things behind her back and lie to her because all I asked was ""no"" 90% of the time. No concerts, no trips, no movies, no sleepovers, no beaches, no festivals, no parties, no birthdays even when my friends invited me. She deprived me of many of the pleasures one experiences at that age.

Every time I did things that went against her, something she didn't like, she became very aggressive. She screamed, insulted me (whore, crazy, scum..), grabbed my neck or my arms aggressively, squeezing, spat on me and became even crazier when I held her arms to stop her from hurting me. Sometimes she closed the shutter and the door of my room and forced me to sleep even at 7-8 p.m. after her tantrum.

Her grudge would last for days. She would remind me that she is the mother and that she has all the rights, that I must respect her and do everything she says. She threatened me that I wouldn't go anywhere and that if I tried to escape, she would find me. She had her crazy moments where she would tell me that she wished that I would get sick and disappear so that she would be alone, or that if I tried to escape, she would take a knife and  would stab me and go to jail for that. She's already had phrases like ""you're not my daughter anymore"" (when I was in middle school) or ""shouldn't I have aborted that one?""  in a fit of anger.

Today I'm 26 and I no longer live with her. She changed and became nicer, she has made efforts to sort things out and wish to have a good mother/daughter relationship with me. I still don't think she deserves to have me in her life. Same for other moms who did similar things. I know it's hard being a parent but nothing justifies abuse and toxicity.",Petite_Curious,618,308,0.8799999952316284,0.13833946142802114,1694696840,/r/changemyview/comments/16ii0kt/cmv_bad_moms_dont_deserve_their_childs/,2023,9
16uvn4r,"CMV: Abortion is technically murder, but at the same time women should be paid to have children","**Regarding Abortion**

First of all, I want to clarify that I am not advocating for a total ban. Rather, I believe we need to change the way the practice is both viewed and restricted. Note that everything below pertains to regular cases of abortions, not abortions due to rape/incest which many would agree should be treated with a separate considerations:

* Generally agree with the Ben Shapiro argument, at least in so far as to why fetuses should be considered humans. If it is properly taken care of for a long enough, a fetus that lacks pretty much everything will develop into an infant with under-developed senses, then a pre-teen with under-developed reproductive organs, all the way until they are around 25 y.o. when their brain is fully developed and the aging process begins. Under a Roe v. Wade style policy we draw the line at the first stage of development (""senses""). I believe this is problematic since we're essentially saying that it's ok to kill a human if they have no awareness of it, which can also apply to many grown adults. The same problem happens regardless of where the line is drawn, not to mention the whole mess when it comes to premature babies. This clearly puts abortion as a form of human murder in my view.
* However, this doesn't mean that this form of murder should be completely outlawed because *we don't actually do that*. We justify killing criminals, terrorists, and even home invaders if we believe they either have caused or have the potential to cause great harm. (think: the baby Hitler argument scaled way down). Going even further, would you, say, shoot down a few hundred innocent civilians on those planes knowing that many thousands of lives would be saved on that day and tens of thousands more from the war? Many would say yes, including many who have sacrificed their lives on one of them. Strangely, the same argument can be applied to innocent fetuses if their potential life will most definitely ruin the potential life of at least the mother. My point here is that I also see the motivation behind a left-leaning stance. Most of us are willing to accept certain immoralities/externalities behind things like eating meat, driving cars, or even participating in a capitalistic system because it's a fact of life. Big fishes eat smaller ones every day regardless of how ""innocent"" the small fish is.
* To add to that, I do still agree that it is ""better"" to kill a human fetus than say a human infant precisely because of the ""awareness"" factor. This further justifies the act, but just because it is ""better"" doesn't mean it is not murder. We must properly recognize the moral weight of such a decision.
* Overall, the point is that I believe we should approach abortion with at least the stigma of it technically being a murderous act, rather than ""it's fine if it is done early enough."" Though it is still a grey issue, the moral weight here should be quite a lot higher than most pro-abortion stances suggest. Furthermore, the current restriction system disadvantages the poor on a moral level as well. It's one thing to commit murder if it would otherwise ruin your life, those around you, and ultimately force a child who did not ask to be born to grow up impoverished. It's another thing to do the same if you have the means and having an unexpected child is - at least relative to others - an inconvenience.
* So what's the alternative if it makes little sense to draw the line based on the pregnancy calendar? This I don't know for sure. It could maybe be a limited strike-based system, or maybe special case-by-case evaluations that adheres to more holistic standard. It'll never be perfect since this is a problem that likely demands a one-size-fits-all solution. Regardless, I believe at the very least we need to move away from the current moral framing around the debate.

**Regarding Childbirth Support**

The above section ultimately poses a right-wing POV against abortion in that it should be treated with greater moral weight and hence more restricted (albeit through different means) compared to a standard Roe v. Wade position. 

However, it bothers me that in the 21st century we have yet to address the fact that women bear the brunt of child-bearing/raising responsibilities without much in return. Yes, we have established things like 50/50 divorces, alimony, pregnancy grants, post-pregnancy support, childcare, paid maternity leave etc. but the overall economic payouts of all of these combined is no where near enough to compensate for the true effort and sacrifices involved with carrying and raising a child, let alone the fact you need to meet certain standards to qualify. The way I see it, this imbalance represents much if not most of what remains in the fight to bridge the gender inequality.

Since we can't make men bear child, I believe the next best form of rebalancing is simply financial compensation/support. Not a few billion a year, but a few *hundred* billion:

* Let's start with some statistics. The average cost of raising a child in the U.S. is around $300k. There are around 4 million births annually. Women on average have slightly less than 2 children in their lifetime. The median household income is around $80k and the median household net worth is around $120k. Our federal budget in 2022 is around $6.5T.
* With these numbers in mind, giving a $100k grant to every woman for the first born child would cost a little over $200B/year (100k \* 4M/2). You can compare this to whatever major social or discretionary programs you'd like, but it's basically nothing in the grand scheme of things.
* I believe the correct amount should be closer to $200k-300k, distributed over different age ranges based on expected cost until the child turns 18 on the simple condition the mother meets the regular social services standards in caring for the child. This amounts to $400B-600B/year. There are many reasonable ways to find the money. I believe it should mostly come from an additional progressive tax (maybe weighted more heavily toward men with children) but maybe some cuts to related social programs like education/childcare could also be appropriate.
* Why I believe this is a good idea:
   * I alleviates the quandary behind the majority of what would have been abortion cases.
   * It tackles gender inequality and simultaneously serve as a wealth distribution program.
   * The UBI argument: The program simply recycles cash in the hands of citizens who can then make free market choices. It is also easy to understand and execute, meaning that there is no real reason to invent large overheads and/or involve any form of privatization, hence less room for inefficiency and corruption.
   * Also UBI: The benefits are both uniform and progressive. Every child comes with their own challenges and every woman is compensated equally, but lower-income households will feel the impact more strongly.
   * It could potentially be another deterrent to illegal immigration by furthering the gap between how easy it is for legal and illegal citizens to get by. If you don't see this as a pro then we'd need to get into the whole immigration can of worms.

**Preemptively Addressing a Few Potential Counter-arguments:**

* Abortion:
   * What about ""my body my rights""? The argument doesn't really hold here if we've established that abortion is technically murder. So if you disagree with that premise then CMV.
   * Killing fetuses without their ""consent"" is definitely unconstitutional if we've accepted that they are humans - Yes, but I would like to focus this discussion from a moral/logical POV rather than on the basis of an old and ambiguous legal document.
* Childbirth Support
   * Money can't solve everything. What about the emotional cost of raising a child? Yes, but it's the best straight-forward, one-size-fits-all solution in my view. If you have a better idea to rebalance the child-bearing/raising gap then CMV.
   * What if the $200k or so is not used to benefit the child? The idea of the grant is ultimately compensation to women for the opportunity cost of child-bearing/raising, but I also believe in most cases both should naturally come hand in hand. 
   * If this is a form of UBI, wouldn't it cause inflation? No this is ultimately a redistribution program. The recent inflation was caused by excessive money printing and UBI just got a bad rep by association. I believe UBI can be effective if applied correctly.

There you have it. This is my first post here and I'd have to admit I'm not a political junkie so please educate me if I'm misinformed on anything.

16p8ny1,CMV: US Immigration policy is a total shitshow,"I’m the definition of an immigration dove — I love immigrants. I love seeing the varied cultures people bring with them and learning about the values that people of those cultures bring with them. I love hearing the different inflections in the voices of immigrants. I love being able to access foods of dozens of countries in my community. I love the idea that my country could be so great that people uproot their entire lives and those of their families to come here and start over and improve their well-being. 

There are also numerous objective benefits immigrants bring to the USA. I remember one of my college history professors saying that one of the major reasons that the US didn’t undergo a revolution or major social upheaval in the 30’s was the large immigrant population. Our national unemployment is roughly non-existent and our companies need people to work jobs to continue to grow and prosper. If there was ever a time in the last century to have a generous, functional, effective immigration policy, this is it.

Which is not what we have right now. What we have is a total free-for-all at the border, that ultimately serves neither the immigrants hoping to establish a new, better, life in the USA, nor the country as a whole. Let’s start with basic questions of security:

Our federal agencies have very limited operational control of the border. People constantly cross between ports of entry. It’s widely known among federal agencies that cartel operators funnel migrants to mass and cross at particular locations in order to occupy Border Patrol, so they can smuggle contraband in the vacated crossings. The shear mass of numbers of migrants crossing overwhelm the ability of Border Patrol to vet them, allowing only the most cursory of background checks, which will completely miss any criminality in their home country. And this is only for the migrants who surrender themselves/are caught by Border Patrol. Some of the contraband that the cartels smuggle over are human beings who, for one reason or another, want to stay off of the federal government’s radar.

The way most of these migrants are hoping to normalize their status in the United States is the asylum process. Many of them are unaware that at best this is a temporary patch on a system that will eventually leave them in legal limbo. It is easy to claim asylum, but not so easy for it to be granted. To claim it, you pretty much just have to say that you have a credible fear of being persecuted back in your home country. At this point the migrant will receive a notice to appear (NTA) before an immigration judge where that claim will be adjudicated. At the point, the migrant is generally free to go where they please. They may apply for a work permit six months after making this claim. So they can start their lives, get a job, etc. while they are waiting to be actually granted asylum, but what many do not understand is that asylum is only granted for credible fear of persecution based on a narrow set of criteria. Even though it takes years for those asylum claims to be adjudicated, at the end of the day only about 15% of claimants are granted asylum. Because ICE only prioritizes deportations of serious criminals, those who are denied asylum still generally remain in the US, but they have no legal status and are extremely vulnerable to changes in policy or political leadership.

Both of these are batshit crazy ways to run a country: a functionally open border, and a pathway to status normalization that fails 15% of the time. The alternative for a migrant, of course, is to apply for a visa in the legal way, but this is a laughable solution. There is no visa category of “economic immigrant.” You either need to have a family member who is already a citizen, highly educated, professional job qualifications in specific fields, or lots and lots of money. There is NO legal pathway for someone who wants to just come to the United States to be a roofer, or a restaurant worker. Actually, that’s not totally true. There are H2B visas. However, the US only gives out 66,000 of those a year, and they are by statute temporary visas with no pathway to permanent residency. 

This is no way to run a railroad. I have no problem with the number of immigrants coming into the United States, but I do want the government to be sure they are the right ones. Certainly most who are coming are decent people, but the government needs to at least have the ability to sort out the few bad actors and deny them entry. Allowing bad actors and contraband through is a great way to radicalize public opinion against immigration and stoke racial and ethnic resentment and paranoia. It also needs a sane visa process for economic migrants. Having millions of rejected asylum-seekers living underground lives, open to exploitation, and in a precarious legal condition is a terrible way to bring in immigrants. 

I hated the idea of Trump’s wall when he ran on it in 2016, but it pains me to say that I think it needs to be built. It’s definitely not a solution in and of itself, but it can at least start the process of creating an orderly immigration system. Some might ask how the US would pay for improved border security and visa processing (I don’t see this as an ingenuous concern considering US federal spending practices, but it can at least be addressed and knocked down). Well, cartels are charging virtually everyone who crosses the US border between $5000 and $10000 each (taking advantage of our ineptitude to enrich their coffers). Even if we undercut their prices by 50% to charge immigration fees to applicants, these fees would offset much of the cost, and allow migrants to use the remainder of their savings to take routes from their home countries to the United States that are safer than a trek through the Darien Gap and a 1000 mile ride on the top of a Mexican train.

This is long enough already, but one final thought I need to include is that another direct result of this ineptitude is the enabling of the explosive enrichment and growth of the cartels. It’s created an opportunity for them to charge these enormous travel fees to migrants and smuggle contraband of all kinds across the border. Their annual revenue has ballooned into the billions of dollars and the US runs the real risk that in the future they could completely overrun the Mexican government and establish a true narco-state just across the border. (For those thinking that I’m being hyperbolic, Mexico’s annual tax revenue is $22 billion. The cartel’s estimated annual revenue is $13 billion. I know who my money is on in the long term, considering how much more the government has to spend money on other than security compared to the cartels.)

Maybe that’s the kind of thing that will be necessary before the United States takes immigration seriously, but at that point any hope of the sane, generous, orderly immigration policy that I think we need will be lost. There’s no way that’s happening once our southern neighbor become the Republic of Sinaloa.",solishu4,288,457,0.800000011920929,0.12993796867418045,1695384714,/r/changemyview/comments/16p8ny1/cmv_us_immigration_policy_is_a_total_shitshow/,2023,9
16m25zs,CMV: Far-left “tankie” media is harmful to democracy.,"I know the word “tankies” has had a lot of meanings throughout history. For the purposes of this post it refers to the modern way it’s commonly used, i.e. far-left “anti-imperialists” who tend to hate the nebulous West. 

I’m talking about the Grayzone/Multipolarista types, the Max Blumenthals, Ben Nortons, and their ilk. To them, the concept of democracy is secondary to the demise of Western power. 

They present themselves as anti-imperialists because they ostensibly support the liberation of smaller “global south” nations under the grip of global hegemony. Now, I’m all for anti-imperialism in principle, every country should have the maximum amount of self determination possible to shepherd their people into as prosperous a future as possible without some big power boot on their neck. 100%. 

The problem I have with tankies in this context is that anti-imperialism should be pro-democracy. But that is not what’s emanating from these circles. 

In practice, what it looks like is simply being anti-West. If the US, Europe, or their allies are in *any* way even tangentially involved in some geopolitical conflict or dispute, it doesn’t matter what the conflict is, or where it is, or what the motivations are, or who is involved, or what they are doing, the other side is *always right* to these people. 

They seem to giddily support all manner of autocratic brutality as long as it is done in the service of damaging the West’s influence in the world. Everything is a zero-sum game, and the West must never win it no matter what the cost. 

They deny atrocities and push any manner of conspiracy theories (White helmets being false flag terrorists. China not committing atrocities against Uyghurs, no chemical weapons use in Syria, etc.) that would put their favorite dictators in a bad light and, by extension, advance the Western position. 

Look at Syria, Russia, China, Venezuela, Cuba, etc. There is seldom even the slightest, most tepid condemnation for the crimes that these governments impose on their own people and others, because they are “fighting” or “resisting” western influence, and by virtue of that, they can do no wrong in the context of this great power struggle. 

I have yet to see any evidence that they would be willing to forcefully condemn “non-west” dictators for anything they do, as long as the US/Europe oppose them, or any evidence that they would support a democratic cause if it would somehow benefit the west at the expense of great power rivals, but I'm open to hearing opposing views.",BrokkenArrow,234,469,0.6399999856948853,0.1259771684700774,1695059287,/r/changemyview/comments/16m25zs/cmv_farleft_tankie_media_is_harmful_to_democracy/,2023,9
16lc5e2,"CMV: Elon is using Twitter for power, not money","I apologize if this has been brought up before, but the discussions on Musk and Twitter are probably missing the main point. Musk is using Twitter for power, it doesn't matter how much money it's losing. Running Twitter lets him exert outsized influence in world affairs without ever having to be elected. Hell, it even lets him wave his Lil Elon around without having to be a very good businessman (I don't know enough to say whether he is or isn't btw).

Also, all of his decisions with checkmarks, and bans, and renaming are flexes. People may complain, but they're not leaving. All the impotent hate probably amuses him and stokes his shitty ego.

And I can bet he will continue using his fortune to keep on subsidizing Twitter even if it's losing money. In the greater scheme of things, keeping it is probably good for his bottom line. In that sense, Musk isn't running Twitter into the ground, he's running it to exactly suit his needs. Musk is history's first billionaire influencer.",Quick-Ad9335,479,319,0.8199999928474426,0.12399016503334184,1694984715,/r/changemyview/comments/16lc5e2/cmv_elon_is_using_twitter_for_power_not_money/,2023,9

16i2l1y,CMV: The far left overall does not have more compassion and empathy towards others than those to the right of them,"One thing I've noticed, in many conversations with far leftists, is that I often feel like a worse person afterwards. Like sure, maybe logically my ideas are sound (sometimes), but I just don't have that level of empathy and compassion that they do. The level of compassion and empathy that would make it so when I walked by a homeless person living on my street my first reaction was  ""I'm so happy that they are able to camp on my street, but lots more needs to be done they are suffering"" and not ""are they going to ask me for money, are they sane, are they violent."" And then I would feel actual joy upon seeing them. 

And I feel like this is an idea the far left has perpetuated- that they are the most caring and compassionate and empathetic. Maybe not the most logical always, but the most emotionally connected to others. And they are able to present all sorts of whacky ideas under the guise that they are superior in this way. And the anger you see when somebody challenges them- well that's natural they are so deeply connected to the suffering person that they feel the pain for the other person. 

But I think, if anything, the far left overall is less compassionate and less empathetic than their more moderate counterparts. Many of them are in their most self centered years (college students namely.) They tend to be more hostile towards opposing ideas. Less able to handle criticism. More willing to act out. Traits that are more closely associated with vulnerable self centered ness, not empathy and compassion. Some of the worst people I've met, people who valued power, were also very far to the left. 

My general view is that the extreme left and extreme right have less compassion and empathy for others, but according to the extreme left people to the right of them have less empathy and compassion than them. 

Obviously my view concerns groups, not individuals. I think the far left as a group wants to appear more empathetic and compassionate, but I don't think they actually are. But I'm curious to hear others opinions and open to changing my view.",ICuriosityCatI,0,577,0.41999998688697815,0.12050960735171261,1694648128,/r/changemyview/comments/16i2l1y/cmv_the_far_left_overall_does_not_have_more/,2023,9
16ujn7u,CMV: Israel and Palestine are both victims of bad actions by Arab countries,"Time is 1948, Britain decide they had enough and pull out of the middle-east, dividing the land between Israel and Palestine, under the ""UN Partition plan"". 

Israeli government accepts and declares independence. Palestine government rejects and declares war on Israel. Surrounding Arab countries: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria - declare war on Israel and invade both Israel and Palestine. 

Short version, the war ends with Jordan ruling the West Bank (most of modern day Palestine), Egypt ruling the Gaza strip (Southern Palestine where Hamas is ruling today), Israel surviving and leading an offensive campaign with territorial gains. 

Biggest losers of the war, and the reason for the crisis today: 750,000 Palestinians expelled, no more Palestine. 

Israel was fighting an existential war, so while I cannot justify the atrocities, I can imagine doing whatever is necessary to survive. But Egypt and Jordan were under no circumstances at risk of being invaded by Israel, yet they decided to take advantage of the war and expand into the two most significant areas of today's Palestine. 

The crazy thing is that both Egypt and Jordan made peace with Israel, but never took responsibility for what they did to the Palestinians in 1948.

Imagine a world where the Arab countries don't invade Israel/Palestine in 1948. Israel is not in existential war and can behave rationally. And Palestine is not forced into an all-out war with Israel by its Arab neighbors. This ends with peace, I think. Or at least something better than what we have today...",yoadknux,237,434,0.6800000071525574,0.1190265083867353,1695916347,/r/changemyview/comments/16ujn7u/cmv_israel_and_palestine_are_both_victims_of_bad/,2023,9
16lkv3o,CMV: It's morally wrong for a pregnant woman to neglect her health if carrying to term.,"I believe it's not just irresponsible, but morally wrong for a pregnant woman to disregard her physical health if she plans to give birth. 

Of course if it's her body it's her choice, but as soon as you decide you want to bring the baby to term, that's no longer a valid statement. It becomes two bodies that you're fully responsible to care for. 

I'm not just talking about smoking or drinking. I think you have an moral obligation to do basic exercise and eat healthy, nutritional foods, if a human being is developing inside of you and relies on your actions.

Not to say can't occasionally eat a sugary snack when you're craving something. But if you're stuffing your face with fast food and candy all day, and not doing any physical activity, you're directly harming yourself and more importantly, your child. 

During pregnancy, a fetus is at its most vulnerable point of development. Every cell that makes up it's body is coming from what you injest. Living an unhealthy lifestyle while pregnant can result in a lifetime of problems for the child.

Every pregnant woman should feel morally obligated to put their child before their own desires, just as every parent should after they're born.",CheeseIsAHypothesis,91,513,0.5600000023841858,0.11804106073567151,1695008657,/r/changemyview/comments/16lkv3o/cmv_its_morally_wrong_for_a_pregnant_woman_to/,2023,9
16mswb7,CMV: Whiteness is largely an illusion,"The whiteness illusion is the idea that we can mark any point between different ""races"" and think, or behave as though, there is some significant underlying difference, some difference that should matter to us, between those ""races.""

There are three proofs that I know of, that it is an illusion, and probably others I don't.

1) half a million years ago, every single one of my ancestors was black... and that is true of every single living human being.  If black is real, we're all black right now.  If you go by the one drop rule.

2) if we run the one-drop rule in reverse, and make one drop of white blood evidence of whiteness, it would change everything, and be totally arbitrary.  And so it's clearly fictitious.

3) geneticists tell us, and I believe them, that genetic variability within ""races"" is far higher than variability between them.

Now when I say whiteness is LARGELY an illusion, I'm adding in the knowledge that, in fact, some populations left Africa at different times a long time ago, and their geographic situations and circumstances (evidently) produced small but real genetic differences in the populations.  And so appearance provides a certain amount of real evidence of geographic and circumstantial differences in ancestral populations.

Feel free to add proofs I haven't thought of, and CMV if possible.  Thanks!",tolkienfan2759,149,473,0.6600000262260437,0.11663294963956797,1695134558,/r/changemyview/comments/16mswb7/cmv_whiteness_is_largely_an_illusion/,2023,9
16ke9vd,CMV: Children Shouldn’t Have Tablets at Dinner.,"I work in fine dining and often times have seen children glued to their tablet, phone or gaming station (like Nintendo Switch) during dinner. If you as a parent bring in some sorta entertainment system to babysit your child, you’re a bad parent. It is paramount to child abuse. 

As adults, I’m sure many of us have experienced waking up on some morning and inadvertently finding ourselves looking through short form content or doom scrolling Reddit, suddenly unable to be productive through the day. Imagine if that was your life and such circumstances were facilitated by your family. 

Children who grow up with these environments will almost certainly be diagnosed with ADHD. How couldn’t they be? 

If you have personally done this, you’re an inadequate parent. If you use T.V. or other devices to babysit your children, you’re a bad parent. If you’re typing an excuse for why you do it, you’re still a bad parent and your child would be better off without you.",SeasonedFinonacci,144,473,0.6499999761581421,0.1160341472443584,1694888477,/r/changemyview/comments/16ke9vd/cmv_children_shouldnt_have_tablets_at_dinner/,2023,9
16pj8qm,cmv: the US should have a national ID with photo only issued to citizens instead of SSN,"First, I think that should automatically issued at birth and be free. And most importantly should ONLY be issued to US citizens.

It should have the person’s full name, ID number, date of birth, and photo on the ID and stored in a government database.

Only on the ID (not stored online) it should also have the person’s fingerprint, blood type, organ donor status, and important medical conditions for emergency personnel 

It should also have security features similar to cash to make almost impossible to fake (special paper, security ribbon/thread, etc.)

16n1skp,CMV: Lauren Boebert's most profitable career move right now is to actually launch an OnlyFans page,"With the attention this video has received coupled with her dwindling hopes for a meaningful position in the Republican party, I believe Lauren Boebert has a huge opportunity to mimic the success Joe Rogan made through podcasting by launching an OnlyFans page and embracing adult content creation.  I base this off the following:

1.  She nearly lost her last election and likely has a more difficult one coming up where she's probably lost a significant amount of support after this fallout. Losing her Congressional seat could be the end of her tenure in DC which also diminishes her national profile. 
2. Politically she seems to be in a hole that may only be put past her by becoming Trump's VP. It's possible Trump would enjoy the optics of being next to her on the campaign trail (and I mean this in a literal sense since it seems insiders have labeled MTG to ugly for him) but I think this is a long shot.
3. Sex work has never been more accepted in this country and it's possible Boebert abandoning politics could quickly win people over by championing the legitimacy of adult content. This kind of brand change would get massive attention and be the wind behind her new platform. This country loves giving celebrities second chances and there are PR firms that could turn her into a folk hero in just a few weeks. 
4. I can tell you as a matter of fact that there is nothing more non-partisan than a penis and you are in denial if you don't think people from every political affiliation would not be interested. The amount of interest and money she would bring in would be astounding right now and may be an easier and less stressful career for her. 

Someone change my mind.
