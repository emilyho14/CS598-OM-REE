193i39g,"CMV: Jordan Peterson and youtube personalties that create content like his, are playing a role in radicalising young people in western countries like the US, UK, Germany e.t.c","If you open youtube and click on a Jordan Peterson video you'll start getting recommended videos related to Jordan Peterson, and then as a non suspecting young person without well formed political views, you will be sent down a rabbit hole of videos designed to mould your political views to be that of a right wing extremist.

And there is a flavour for any type of young person, e.g:

* A young person interested in STEM for example can be sent to a rabbit hole consisting of: Jordan Peterson, Lex Fridman, Triggernometry, Eric weinstein, and then finally sent to rumble to finish of yourself with the dark horse podcast
*  A young person interested in bettering themselves goes to a rabbit hole of : Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Triggernometry, Chris Williamson, Piers Morgan, and end up with Russel brand on rumble

However I have to say it has gotten better this days because before you had Youtubers like Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux who were worse.

1aeuoo0,"CMV: A major reason the Trades are dying is not because younger people are lazy, but because the work culture is awful and no one is willing to train apprentices.","When between jobs previously, I had occasionally considered working in the trades. I enjoy working with my hands, and I think some trades such as electrical work sound very interesting on top of that. However, one thing always stopped me. When I was younger, I used to work security on a few construction sites and noticed something that put me off the trades permanently.

The work culture was just beyond awful. Plenty of verbal abuse (screaming curses, insults, and slurs) from bosses towards the apprentices, plenty of racist, sexist, and homophobic talk, and plenty of generally nasty behavior across the board. It didn't matter which site I was at, or which company was working there, there was a similar trend.  This was only half the issue though - the other half I noticed is that for all these construction companies and tradespeople complain about their dying industry, none of them are even willing to train anyone as an apprentice unless they're a family friend or paying for it through school which presents the same issue of accessibility as university. Half the people at those sites were perfectly competent men who were working for total peanuts as temp laborers in the desperate hope that they'd get chosen as an apprentice.

And, you know, who honestly wants to do any of that?

You can call me weak or a snowflake, and that's fine, but the fact of the matter is that younger generations overwhelmingly don't want to deal with that kind of work culture. I am sure many people would be willing to do a trade, if it was actually accessible work without grinding away your body at dangerous temp labor work in the vague hope of getting chosen and if the industry wasn't rife with casual bigotry of all kinds. If the trades are so desperate for new blood, they should work to be a more welcoming and less abusive environment.  I am aware that making mistakes in trades work is much less acceptable than some other industries, but employers don't need to be abusive in order to get this point across and should be focused on teaching and fostering new talent to continue the most important work in human society instead of pushing away anyone they deem emotionally weak because of dudebro locker room culture.",funwithdespair,2068,680,0.949999988079071,0.6276755538865941,1706637491,/r/changemyview/comments/1aeuoo0/cmv_a_major_reason_the_trades_are_dying_is_not/,2024,1
196nl2d,CMV: doctors should not circumcise baby boys unless there’s a clear medical reason for doing so,"Not sure how genital mutilation of baby boys is even allowed in a developed country like the united states.

Why would doctors conduct this completely unnecessary procedure? It doesnt matter if the parents are religious. No doctor should say yes to mutilating a body unless the baby clearly needs it done medically

I believe doctors should not do elective surgeries on children when the child literally has no say in the matter. I can imagine some elective surgeries should be allowed on children if the child has a strong desire to do so. However babies can not consent.

Not only that, it’s almost certain that no child would strongly desire genital mutilation. And even if they strongly desired it, the doctor should still think twice about executing on such a surgery. 

This is a barbaric norm and absolutely unacceptable even if the child’s parents are religious.",slimsippin,1076,1825,0.7599999904632568,0.6028133945296639,1705259686,/r/changemyview/comments/196nl2d/cmv_doctors_should_not_circumcise_baby_boys/,2024,1
1afie1j,"CMV: The Palestinians' fear of getting ethnically cleansed is very real and valid, and it needs to be taken seriously.","It was reported yesterday that 11 cabinet ministers and 15 coalition members of the Knesset attended a conference calling for a ""voluntary migration"" plan of Gazans. Let's call a spade a spade, this is textbook ethnic cleansing. It's no different from when the US ""asked"" Native Americans to move to reservations, or when Soviets conducted population transfers in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. There's no ""voluntary"" here when their homes have been destroyed by the IDF.

The people attended this conference were not some fringe figures as well, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich were both there, they are the Minster of National Security and Minister of Finance respectively. They are also in the war cabinet. Despite the fact that the government has denied these plans, it remains true that these people have real power and real influence in the government. 

When it comes to public perception, the plan is not deeply unpopular or fringe as well. 33% of Israelis support the resettlement and annexation of Gaza and 56% oppose it. Governments all around the world have implemented policies much less popular than 33%, just ask Netanyahu's protestors last year. A proposed policy that only a slim majority of Israelis oppose has a very good chance of becoming actual policy if the political climate changes, even slightly.

If you're a Palestinian, I think it's valid to have fears of being ethnically cleansed from your homes when the climate in Israeli politics is so in favour of such a policy. We need to recognise that and take concrete steps to reaffirm that that's not going to happen, by drawing red lines, or punishing problematic officials, etc.",WheatBerryPie,1063,1608,0.6499999761581421,0.5589267387241597,1706709332,/r/changemyview/comments/1afie1j/cmv_the_palestinians_fear_of_getting_ethnically/,2024,1
1920kb7,"CMV: People who complain about children being ""indoctrinated"" are usually upset that they aren't the ones doing the indoctrinating themselves.","I've known many conservative fundamentalist-Christian parents to complain about children being ""indoctrinated"" by LGBT in public schools, about how universities are indoctrinating their kids into becoming progressive-liberal, how environmentalism, atheism, etc. is all indoctrinating kids.

But these parents were the parents who would force their kids to go to church on Sunday, force their kids to read the Bible, force them to pray, force them to go to religious summer camps, shelter them from outside influence, etc. - in many cases, also heavily censoring what their kids were allowed to read or watch. If anything, the upbringing that they raised their kids was even more focused on instilling a certain message or agenda of the parents' preference in the kids' minds than anything the schools did. Somehow all of their raising of their children this way didn't count as ""indoctrination,"" but the schools or media promoting a pro-LGBT message was ""indoctrination.""

1ach425,CMV: The idea that Wikipedia isn’t a reputable source is a myth bred from the school system.,"We all have heard from teachers that we can’t use Wikipedia because it “isn’t a reputable source.”

In reality, teachers only say that because of how easy Wikipedia makes assignments. And any smart person *still* used Wikipedia for assignments.

You simply scrolled to the bottom and clicked on the sources that were linked, then cited those in your work, even if you just got the info from Wikipedia.

As a website developer myself, who even once put up a fake news website to humor my friends, anyone can make a website. So nothing is really reputable if it’s not peer reviewed.

Teachers accepted non-peer reviewed articles, and articles listed as sources on Wikipedia, but not a Wikipedia link itself. Simply because they knew it was too easy.

Now years later, we have people who still believe Wikipedia isn’t a reputable source and will disregard any information coming from it if used in an argument.",Aspiring-Programmer,1341,705,0.800000011920929,0.45659581368288554,1706379374,/r/changemyview/comments/1ach425/cmv_the_idea_that_wikipedia_isnt_a_reputable/,2024,1
192eqb6,"CMV: It is now in men's best interests to stop using dating apps, disconnect from them entirely, and force society to find a new way for people to meet and date.","39M here, FWIW. The culture of dating apps has established itself in such a way that men have arisen as the unequivocal losers in this game, basically like playing a football game where you start being down by multiple scores and it's already the final quarter of the game. 

We all know the statistics: men get about [1 or 2 matches a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/11btxok/men_how_many_matches_do_you_get_a_day/?rdt=52564), across all dating apps. That's going to be roughly equal to the number of LIKES they get since most men are liking the vast majority of profiles they see, a strategy they are probably justified in using since there's no point in being selective with so little working in one's favor. Women, on the other hand, get [hundreds of likes a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/163amr9/how_many_matches_for_women/?rdt=42121), all of which can translate into a match if they so choose. If I conservatively pick the number as 200 matches a month, that means women are having ONE HUNDRED TIMES THE SUCCESS THAT MEN ARE HAVING. One. Hundred.

That's clearly a losing game for men. So why should we continue to participate? Clearly it is in the best interests of men to collectively agree to stop using dating apps, to delete each and every one of them from our phones and, I dunno, at the very least force us to meet people the old-fashioned way, by meeting people at bars, getting set up with a friend of a friend, asking out your cute coworker, etc. These options are all on the table right now, obviously, but a lot of women aren't even leaving themselves open to the opportunity because they know they've got their ace-in-the-hole on a dating app somewhere. So why risk things with your coworker or do the socially awkward thing of approaching that dude at the bar when you can just rely on these dating apps to do the guesswork for you on whether the dude is even available and if he's interested in you?

It's a losing game for men and we men should collectively agree to stop using dating apps completely. Keep in mind that my viewpoint is not so concerned with how FEASIBLE it is to suddenly get all men to stop using dating apps; it's more about what I think would happen if we could snap our fingers and make it happen. But also, I don't consider it to be completely NON-feasible, since generally it is easier to not do something than it is to do something, right? If I can do my part to do my fellow men a favor, of course I will do that, and I think this move right here is in our best interests.

1991b9g,CMV: The trouble young men are having with dating right now is exaggerated and mostly caused by stunted social development rather than anything young women are doing.,"It has become common in certain online circles to complain about how many young men are single. It does seem to be true that singleness among young men is particularly high right now, but the reasons for this are not what many dejected young men say they are.

Those in the so-called ""manosphere"" or the various ""pilled"" communities generally blame women for their singleness. They accuse women of ""hypergamy"", IE dating men of higher social status than themselves. They accuse women of having unrealistic standards and say most women will only date a man who is over 6 feet tall with an income above 100,000 dollars. Some end up just hating women in general. 

I do not think these people are correct. What I see is a generation of young men who, relative to previous generations, rarely go out of the house and rarely socialize with women in real life. So many young Gen Z men are socially and even physically under-developed because their primary sources of recreation and socialization have been virtual for their whole lives. When you talk to these young men in real life it is clear that they have not developed the social skills and hobbies necessary to interact normally and healthily with women they're attracted to. Moreover, the way these young men talk about women online makes it absolutely clear that they do not regularly interact with a variety of women in real life and do not have a realistic understanding of women.

To put it simply, most women are not interested in dating socially awkward and physically under-developed men who spend all day on the Internet. I think we can all understand that and accept it as normal.

How big is this problem really? Online, it's huge. In real life, I don't think it's all that serious. The great majority of these dejected young men eventually grow up, acquire real life jobs and hobbies, and learn to interact with women like human beings. Once they do that, they generally find women much more interested in them and live a perfectly normal life.",Grandemestizo,682,1383,0.6800000071525574,0.4245631626465113,1705510461,/r/changemyview/comments/1991b9g/cmv_the_trouble_young_men_are_having_with_dating/,2024,1
19brluv,CMV: Sex offenders with more then 10 victims should be chemically castrated and sterilized for the betterment of society,"As harsh as it sounds I really do think it’s necessary. Nobody stumbles into the life of being a serial rapist. It’s not like some sexual assault cases where there’s some, if not nuance, then grey area. To be clear, the assault happening is unjustifiable and wrong no matter what, but the college frat boy who rapes a girl while she’s passed out at a party is different from a predator following a woman to her job, her gym, her house, waiting for a moment to kidnap her and get his rocks off. More time, planning, obsession and in some cases violence go into the latter type of offender.

The frat boy, in most cases I’ve seen, is opportunistic. They want sex. They’d prefer it consensually but if the girl is drunk and too fucked up to say “no” they’re fine with that too. Serial rapists however, they get off on the lack of consent. They get off on the resistance. They want the person to scream, fight and try and run. Domination is inextricably bound up with their sexual desire. 

Did anybody watch The Last of Us on HBO? Well, there’s a character just like that in the show. Someone that gets off on resistance. Someone like that can’t be reformed, retrained or redeemed. They’re wild dogs. And even if you could “tame” them, it’s still too risky in my opinion. A drunk who relapses will likely hurt themselves, either via alcohol poisoning or just your run-of-the-mill self-destruction of their lives. A junkie will likely be the same. Though the risk they betray a friend or family member and rob them for a quick fix is also a factor. They too are more likely to just OD and die.

A serial sex offender though? If they relapse someone is getting raped.

That risk is too much for me. Humans are animals, no? If an untrained/abused/mentally ill dog bites two or three kids, not matter how much their owners might love them, they’re getting put down for the benefit of society according to the state. Even if you could put them on meds or put them in a different environment there’s always the risk that down the line something could set them off and then it might not be a bitten kid you’re dealing with but a dead one. I feel like this is a happy medium for the criminal justice reformers and the tough-on-crime crowd. Because when the offender is “fixed”, we release them from prison free of the “urges” that would make them want to attack someone again, we save billions of dollars that would be otherwise spent on feeding and housing them, and the “law and order” crowd can sleep soundly knowing these guys are castrated and, though they’re free, will remain on a list for the rest of their lives.  

So what do we think?",nowlan101,1073,786,0.8199999928474426,0.40700732002635154,1705800408,/r/changemyview/comments/19brluv/cmv_sex_offenders_with_more_then_10_victims/,2024,1
1acfvhn,CMV: Men are becoming more conservative because progressives refuse to talk about men's issues.,"The way I see it. There's few people who want to speak to men about the issues the face in a way that doesn't either center women or blame men. I took multiple feminist studies classes in college and something I noticed as the only man there was that how patriarchial standards harm men was also said as a footnote, minimized, or implied that men were holding the boot on their own heads. 

As a man born in 2001 who has literally no political or socioeconomic power other than my own ability to vote, I could easily see how this would be frustrating. I feel there are issues I have to deal with that women do not have to. I also feel that it's not other men that cause 100% of those issues 100% of the time. A lot of women who believe they are feminists don't want to acknowledge this because they feel conceding any point to women having any aspect of life easier than or playing into certain patriarchial roles anti-feminist and pro-men.

Men are struggling to date more and more. I mean I saw some statistics that men age 18 to 30 were twice as likely to be single than the same age group. Many young men are struggling to find romantic partnerships. The ""feminist"" view to that is to tell them that they're not entitled to romantic love. The Petersonian view is that men are struggling and they should be allowed to feel what they feel and it is a problem that so many men are lonely. g that hates you.

With this I think there's been a bit of an overcorrection to casual misogyny that women specifically in my generation do where they call for an end to casual misogyny (valid and correct) while combating it with casual misandry. Again, seeing both of these views perpetuated by what you believe feminist are and by someone who calls themself a feminist, you're not gonna want to look into it. You'll view it as something counter to you and something that hates you.

This is such a common belief that the average man's exposure to ""feminism"" is likely going to be from social media and turn him off from feminist ideals. I mean why would he? If some 19-year-old dude keeps seeing online that not only is he oppressing women but he's also the cause of his issues, he's not gonna see feminism as a positive thing. st, you're not gonna want to look into it.

19dyanb,"CMV: The ""Free Market"" doesn't work with goods and services that are necessary to sustain life. An choice of purchase or die is not a free and voluntary exchange entered into by equals, its an ultimatum.","I think the free market, such as it is anyway, works pretty well for about 90% of the normal consumer good related market activity most of us engage in.

The ""free market"" breaks down, it's internal check and balance mechanisms, become self destructive, when the good or service is one that cannot be refused on pain of death or substantial material deprivation. 

This is why healthcare, housing, and food are so often the ones that require the greatest government intervention to stabilize and are most prove to radical exploitation is left to their own devices. Everyone needs to live somewhere, and everyone is eventually gonna need a doctor, everyone has to eat, and one cannot freely opt to refuse these services, well you can, but in the same way you can freely choose to not give a mugger your wallet and get shot. It's not a ""free"" choice, it's a coercion and an ultimatum. It is widely accepted that a choice made at spearpoint isn't a free choice. Whether that spear it literal or in the form of not being able to afford insulin.

Without the consumer being a free agent, able to enter into an exchange with the purveyor as equals, able to arrive at a mutual beneficial transaction, the inherent self-correcting mechanisms of the ""free"" market break down, because at that point the market, at least the market for that good or service, is not free. It is obligatory. 

When a good cannot be refused, on pain of death or severe material deprivation, the purveyor is free to jack up the price as high as they wish, they are free to price a large swathe of people out of the market entirely, accepting their demise as chaff if it means the profit they pull in off of the substantially higher price on fewer transactions still proves more fruitful than lower profit on more transactions.   


There are only two ways to address this. At a certain point, people, as in the bulk of the people, the mass of the people, will not merely accept dying cause their job doesn't pay enough. That state of affairs will eventually lead to civil unrest of uprising. Which of course will see a breakdown of the market. To avoid this happening, an institution, usually the government, must put their hand into the transaction in some way to ensure the populace has access to the service, either by subsidizing the purchasers or placing price controls on the purveyors. 

&#x200B;

But long story short, in the case of an obligatory good or service, the market can never be free. The choice is coercive to the buyer by default, and can only be corrected by institutional intervention, or dismantling the market entirely (usually violent revolt). But all three scenarios are not free markets.",Jimithyashford,1014,592,0.8500000238418579,0.35631724520635605,1706042224,/r/changemyview/comments/19dyanb/cmv_the_free_market_doesnt_work_with_goods_and/,2024,1
190eajj,"CMV: Anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic, though both Zionists and Anti-Zionists can be antisemitic","From the Jewish Virtual Library, Zionism is defined as the national movement for the return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. It is NOT just the self-determination of the Jewish people. To disagree with Zionism is not to deny Jewish people of their right to self-determination, but to resist the maintenance of **Jewish sovereignty** in **Israel** and maybe Palestine depending on which form of Zionism one is talking about.

It's not anti-Kurdish to say that Kurds shouldn't have their own state, or anti-Scot to say Scots shouldn't be independent in Scotland, or anti-Roma to say that Roma shouldn't be granted a state. Therefore it is not antisemitic to say that the Jewish people shouldn't have their own state. If, however, Zionism is PURELY the self-determination of the Jewish people, then anti-Zionism can be associated with antisemitism, but that's not what Zionism is.

Furthermore, saying that Jewish people shouldn't have their own state is not the same as saying Israelis shouldn't have their own state, just as saying Whites shouldn't have their own state in England is not the same as saying the English shouldn't have their own state in England. There is a leap of logic that Israeli == Jews for that equivalence to hold true. One can hold anti-Zionist position while believing that Israelis living in modern-day Israel deserve a state, which is also my position.

On top of that, it's not antisemitic to say that a people shouldn't have inherent sovereignty in a country. If someone says ""There should be White or Black sovereignty in America"", you are not a racist to criticise that person.

Lastly, no group is entitled to return to their homeland. Americans of German descent are not entitled to anything in Germany, the Romani people are not entitled to anything in northwest India. Chinese diaspora in Singapore are not entitled to anything in China. Singaporean Chinese can't just move to ShenZhen and start claiming the city belongs to them. I am not anti-German, anti-Roma, anti-Chinese for pointing all of these out, so why am I antisemitic for pointing this in Zionism out?

With that being said, there are anti-Zionists and Zionists that are antisemitic. On one hand, it's not uncommon to hear things like ""Zionists control the media/the bank"", ""Zionists are too rich"", etc. in the anti-Zionist camp, these are antisemitic statements and should be condemned. On the other, many neo-Nazi parties and fundamentalist Christians are vehement supporters of Zionism yet they hold some very antisemitic views.

1ae4b6a,"CMV: No group of people in history would willing allow the enactment of anything like the Zionist project on their own land, and no group of people would, in the Palestinians' place, respond to Zionism with anything but hostility.","For me, the most frustrating thing about the discourse surrounding Palestine-Israel is the way in which the Palestinian people are routinely portrayed as irrationally extreme, violent, or anti-Semitic, when in fact their deep hostility to Zionism (and Israel in general) is the most obvious and predictable thing imaginable. I am convinced that **no group of people in history would willing allow the enactment of anything like the Zionist project on their own land, and no group of people would, in the Palestinians' place, respond to Zionism with anything but hostility.**

Imagine the following scenario in *your* country:

* A group of people are immigrating into your country in massive numbers, and *they have made it explicitly clear they want their own state on your land*. They go from a trivial percent of the population (\~2%) to almost a third of the population in around a generation. A foreign power retains control of your immigration policy and doesn't allow you to stop the influx
* As soon as this group arrives, they begin lobbying foreign powers to grant them their own state on your land. They'd love all of it, but they'll take as much as they can get for now
* They buy up land from absentee owners and kick off native tenants. They enact terms on the land that makes it illegal for it ever to be owned or worked by anyone but them ever again
* Eventually they succeed in making their case to the reigning superpowers: despite representing less than one third of the population and being mostly foreign-born, they are granted over half of your land — including half the coast and virtually all of the best farmland. Additionally huge numbers of your people will now have to live in their ethnostate, while none of them are expected to live on your side.

Given this history, the Palestinians rejected the 48' deal. Can someone seriously tell me that they are surprised? How do you imagine *your* people would respond? Do you really think that your people would have accepted that deal? 

Or, to put it differently, if the Zionists had wanted Connecticut or Cornwall for their state, do you think the US or UK would have considered that proposition for a single second? Do you think they would have handed over a single acre of their territory for a Jewish state? And if not, why should the Palestinians have been expected to?

Here is some additional evidence:

* The 30s and 40s were a massive litmus test of the Western world's decency toward refugees, and virtually everyone failed. There *were* hundreds of thousands of Jews looking for a home then, due to Nazism, and every single country turned them away. As an American, I think it is to our eternal shame that we did not go out of way to take in the whole of European Jewry, but if the US — a far larger and richer country with a much, much larger Jewish population (at the time) — was unwilling to open its doors, why are we surprised that the Palestinians weren't crazy about Jewish immigration, when it clearly meant the death of their society?
* I was once arguing with a Zionist about the right of return. And he said: ""Of course we can't offer them a right of return. It would mean the end of the Jewish nature of Israel."" He was right of course — that would be the result. He was also right to imply that *obviously* Israel is going to implement policies that protect it from being overwhelmed demographically; obviously, Israel is going to behave with the instinct towards self-defense that all functioning societies do. But to him the Palestinians were simply not human enough for him to have to consider the obvious: the entire existence of Israel is predicated on the Palestinians having been denied the right to do this very thing, to protect their society's integrity
* Far smaller rates of immigration create tremendous controversy throughout the developed world. Think about how controversial Muslim immigration into Europe is. Right now Muslims represent around 7.5% of France's population, after 80 years of immigration. In Palestine, in less time, Jews went from 2% to 30% of the population. And it's funny: most of the folks that are pro-Israel are also anti-immigration. They would absolutely lose their minds if they were made to tolerate the rates of immigration the Palestinians had to, especially if their immigrants were making it known they wanted their own country!
* In fact, I cannot think of a single country that currently allows the rates of immigration seen in Palestine in the early 20th century.
* I cannot think of a single people in history that has willingly allowed such a massive demographic change to take place on its land. If you can think of one, please, by all means, share.
* I cannot think of a single people who have willingly traded away any of their land for the sake of others' national aspirations
* I expect to hear the common Zionist talking point that ""There never was a Palestinian state, and Palestinian identity only goes back to the early 20th century."" This is undoubtedly true, but, for the life of me, I cannot understand what the implication of this is supposed to be. Are they saying: ""because the Arabs of the land of Palestine never had a nation state, it's okay to swap out their society for another one""? This logic looks remarkably like that used to colonize the Americas and Africa: they don't have a state, so they don't count politically. If this means something else, please let me know.

Well I live in a town with an obscene homeless population, one of the largest in America. 

Anti homeless architecture does not reflect how hard a city is trying to help their homeless people. Some cities are super neglectful and others aren’t. But regardless, the architecture itself isn’t the problem. I know that my city puts tons of money into homeless shelters and rehabilitation, and that the people who sleep on the public benches are likely addicted to drugs or got kicked out for some other reason. I agree 100% that it’s the city’s responsibility to aid the homeless.

But getting angry at anti homeless architecture seems to imply that these public benches were made for homeless people to sleep on…up until recently, it was impossible to walk around downtown without passing a homeless person on almost every corner, and most of them smelled very strongly of feces. But we’ve begun to implement anti homeless architecture and the changes to our downtown have been unbelievable. We can actually sit on the public benches now, there’s so much less litter everywhere, and the entire downtown area is just so much more vibrant and welcoming.

190573g,"CMV: As an Asian American, voting for the Democratic Party is the only viable option for me, as they are the lesser of two evils","As someone deeply engaged in the upcoming election, I remain aligned with the Democratic Party as an Asian American, especially considering I reside in California. This state is the wealthiest in the nation and holds a remarkable economic standing, with a GDP that, if considered independently, would rank among the top 10 globally.

On top of that, the GOP has this habit of throwing around racist remarks, which just doesn't sit right with Asians. It's the kind of stuff that could be used against them, especially when we're talking about the surge in hate crimes against Asians.

While Asians encompass a rich tapestry of ethnic diversity, I want zero in on the ""holy Asian trinity"" (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) due to their numerous and influential representation among the Asian community. Democrats tend to lean towards supporting social safety nets and regulations, and this tends to resonate more with educated minorities.

Education holds immense significance in Asian culture, exemplified by phenomena like cram schools in East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan, where students attend supplementary classes to gain a competitive edge in entrance exams to some of the most competitive colleges in their respective country.

Drawing a comparison within the U.S., states under Republican governance tend to exhibit lower academic achievements than their Democratic counterparts. This discrepancy is often attributed to the Republican Party's inclination to reduce funding for education, resulting in lower academic outcomes.

While there is a consensus that schools could benefit from increased cost efficiency, the solution does not lie in defunding education.

And if we help in *too* much or in the wrong ways we get called cultural imperialists sticking our white noses into brown/black people's business and messing up their countries. If we don’t help enough, as the case shows in Rwanda or the current Latin American refugee crisis, we’re a callous, settler-colonial nation who couldn’t give two shits about the plight of the black man or the brown man suffering just beyond our borders.

The history of human life on earth is in large part a study of the various empires we created over thousands of years and based on our predecessors, I’d say if America is an empire, we’re by far the most benign and just the world has yet seen. We’re grading on a curve of course but does anybody else here reasonably think we’d be better under a Pax Russia? Pax China? Pax Britannia? How about the slave empires of the antiquity such as Rome, Greece, or any of the Islamic Caliphates? 

There should be some middle ground between giving the appropriate credit to countries that have made enormous strides in terms of lifting their citizens out of poverty, ending hunger and raising the standards of living while also acknowledging the role, where it’s appropriate, of the US in facilitating it. For example, China lifting hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty is a major humans rights achievement. China is/should be very proud of it. But it never would have happened with out the aid of US markets, US credit, and US help. And we should take pride in that as well. But liberals think they’re above the low hanging fruit of patriotism, “why do we even need to be proud of our country? That’s weird.” — because it’s so associated with the political Right.

18ynlm7,CMV: Identifying as Agnostic is more scientific and fact-based that considering yourself an Atheist while strict Atheism is not that far off from religion,"Hey everyone,  
so in my personal circle, many identify as atheists, an most of them reason that it is the most logical conclusion, based on facts and science. They argue that concepts like God and an afterlife are historical constructs born out of a desire to explain the unknown.  
My perspective differs. I think the most factual and scientifically backed stance on topics like afterlife, god-like entities etc. is considering oneself an Agnostic (aka I don´t know if a God or an Afterlife etc. exists, but I will not say that I´m certain that they don´t). I believe we lack the knowledge to assert certainty on these matters, distinct from claiming nothing of that sort exists. I'm referring to general concepts, not specific religions. Consider the questions science currently can't answer: the origin of life, the true operation of the human mind, and the purpose of human intelligence. And much more.

So at the end of the day, if you are saying ""No God exists, no Afterlife, all that is complete bullshit"", that is like defending a Religion to some point, since YOU DON´T KNOW FOR CERTAIN. You just feel better because you have fact based science behind your back (allegedly), not some old book. But that is viewing science backwards.

And I´m gonna make an argument with, you guessed it, science.

Here are the things we know (read know as in it is scientifically proven to the best of our current level of knowledge and understanding) and what that does this imply regarding the mentioned religious concepts:  
The universe didn‘t always exist. It was created or popped into existence at some point, most likely a few billion years ago. We don‘t know what caused that though.  
The laws of physics we base all our understanding of anything on, did not always apply, even after the creation of the universe (Plank Epoch). They don‘t even apply universally after that (Black Holes). And we have no idea of what was before all of that.  
We currently use two big theories to explain what we know about the universe, Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, and they conflict with each other. So what we do with those is always a approximation, no matter how well the models work.  
So, the laws of physics as we understand them today don‘t always apply, even within our universe, and our theories of explaining them are at the very least missing some key factor(s)we don‘t know of and they even could be entirely wrong.   
Also the universe did not always exist, which implies that there could‘ve been something before that (before is a complicated term to use here as time probably didn‘t exist, at least not the way it works now).  And that also opens the possibility that that „before“ didn‘t stop existing when the universe was created. So a state where none of the laws of physics apply, time doesn‘t exist etc., something that is literally unimaginable for humans, could exist outside the scope of our universe.We have no idea what is going on there, if this “plane of existence”, should it exist, or if it can interact with our Universe.  
So is there any proof of one or several god-like beings/entities or something resembling what we call the afterlife existing? No.  
Is there enough „wiggle room“ in what we currently know that there could be? Yes.  
Why is it considered to be unscientific to believe in that kind of stuff? Because we have no proof of it.  
Is the „not having proof“ thing kind of inherently tied to those concepts? Kind of, I think?  
Like, most established religions base their believes on stuff that supposedly happened a long time ago, where a god-like figure made connections with humans, which is unscientific. Believing in what the Bible, the Quran or the Torah says is unscientific, since there are way more plausible explanations why those religions were created and those texts were writtten etc.   
But what I‘m saying includes that it is not completely impossible that those books are right, for all of you guys out there who actually are practitioners of a Religion, but it is very far from just acknowledging that those general concepts could exist.  
And those concepts like god-like figure(s), an afterlife, a force outside of the universe that created life+intelligence+consciousness are not disproven by science by any means. I actually think categorically denying the sheer possibility of the existence of those things is human hubris at its finest.   
We don‘t understand our universe at this point, we don’t even know how far we’re away from understanding it, with all the scientific advances we have made over the last 10000 years.

1952r0z,CMV: Zombies Would Be Much Easier To Survive Than People Think,"We’re going based off the stereotypical zombie here. They’re slow, want brains and don’t have much of a consciousness. If you get bit, you turn into one.
That being said, I feel as though it may be earlier to survive one than people make it out to be. When pictured, people usually think of a post apocalyptic world but I think we could go about life pretty normally.
For starters, if this disease eats away at the host like it portrays in some media’s, it’s going to eventually get rid of their ability to see, hear, touch and even bite meaning they’re not really all that dangerous. Even if it doesn’t, and it only starts to infect the dead the only real threat are really only people who have recently passed away as their body has not been corroded yet, and likely still have full functionality. But I feel like this doesn’t make things all that harder because everyone would steer clear of the zombie once it first becomes infected, hence creating less infected and making it easier to contain. Again, the zombie is slow so you have plenty of time to react.
Suppose there is a hoard anyways, they don’t have much of a consciousness and will probably just follow whatever noise they hear if that sense still remains. So we can just gather them up with a large radio or something. But if it doesn’t work as planned, then just stay inside. They probably won’t recall how to use a doorknob let alone have the strength to open it. So as long as the windows are fairly strong you should be fine. If this disease removes an individuals senses, why not the rest of them? Meaning all we have to do is wait it out from here. Of course, food is an issue, but assuming you are at home, in a grocery store or mall we could just ration it. If not, then growing micro greens whilst you wait for other bigger plants to grow could work due to how long we can go without food. After the majority of the zombies are either caught or decayed we can return to our normal life. Even if there are some left, people will be more wary of it, so much so we’ll likely have a set of instructions on how to avoid or deal with a zombie when we see one.",Lost-Candy1084,510,373,0.8799999952316284,0.19334133999045594,1705085925,/r/changemyview/comments/1952r0z/cmv_zombies_would_be_much_easier_to_survive_than/,2024,1

1adsjhe,CMV: Black-and-white Us-vs-Them thinking prevents us from resolving most social issues yet is impossible to avoid,"*I am starting this one with a genuine hope that someone can change my view. Please, change my view, I really hate having it.*

This problem comes up everywhere, but I'll explain on the example of gender debate as it's what I'm most embedded in. I realise it's massive in politics but it's not what I'm focusing on here.

The one thing I battle with the most is the tendency to paint all men or all women as being this or that, and using it to justify dismissing them and their problems, saying they're not deserving of something, justifying being mean to them, discriminating against them while claiming they asked for it, punishing an individual for the sins of the group, and so on.

Very often B&W thinking is underlined by some painful personal experience with one person or more, which is then generalised to the entire gender. Sometimes it's super overt, like [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0g2drvCUYj/) (men think of their families, women only about themselves) or [here](https://medium.com/@donna.gratehouse/society-does-include-men-but-whenever-society-is-being-called-upon-to-address-mens-problems-it-s-6ea30fe2f4ac) (women want to help men but all they ever get in return is violence). Other times it's by implication, like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiDpvn77eqE&lc=UgyZ5Bm0GnM23wIQ5wR4AaABAg) (highlighted comment implying that all women want marriage and will make it a disaster for men) or [here](https://medium.com/@lelper/10-things-for-guys-not-to-do-on-dating-apps-5680ce34ffd9) (men are shit at dating, listing 10 sins which are hardly things only men do). I'm literally just picking a couple examples I've got fresh in my mind, but there are millions around. 

It's usually examples of the [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error). 

* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the good ones and everything **we** do is good or, if it's bad, it's because **They** provoked us or deserved it anyway. Meanwhile, when **They** do something bad, it's proof of their wicked evil nature.
* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the innocent victims and underdogs and **They** are the perpetrators in power.

Those basic narratives are so powerful and play so hard to the tribal thinking we evolved with, that it's incredibly hard to break out of them. The simplicity of this heuristic just makes it win with the complex truth that the world is not B&W but all shades and colours, that everybody is different and you can't just treat groups as monoliths. They might have power in this domain but we have power in another, many people in the group might have power but not necessarily this person, some of us are also pretty shitty sometimes while some of them are actually great, and so on.

Of course, there are many who know this. When you explicitly ask people about it, many will say this. But in practice, most still act and overwhelmingly think in terms of black-and-white. And it's a constant in human history - it's as much of a problem now as it was in Ancient Greece, we have evolved nothing.

What does this mean? It means that it is just such a bloody pain to get through to people! To help them stop spending so much energy on fighting each other and instead use it on making the world better for everyone. We keep fighting culture wars with imagined enemies and make everyone's lives miserable, while all it would take is to just stop and admit that there is in fact no us and them. That we're just all people who make mistakes and can get better.

But so I go, trying to promote this view, yet every time I feel like I succeeded on some small scale, I just see more and more of that everywhere else. It seems so inescapable.

This is more likely in europe because they are getting really good treatment compared to some other refugees from other countries so they are more likely to just stay and assimilate. The longer the war keeps going, the higher the chance of them not returning and assimilating

Second of all, aid is declining dramatically. US officials have stated that they would keep supporting Ukraine but not on the levels from 2022-2023. Decline in aid could have dramatic consequences for ukraine because they have gotten more aid in 2 years than the aid the USA gave the soviets in ww2(https://www.statista.com/chart/28489/ukrainian-military-humanitarian-and-financial-aid-donors/) so Ukraine is really depended on this aid.

Okay at the very top. I am fully aware that buying a woman a drink does not entitle a man to anything from that woman. That is not something I am here to debate. My point is that I think this is a rude thing to do. By the same token, I think the idea of sending someone a drink and demanding something in return is shitty. I'm not going to debate and argue about whether or not a woman could assume the drink is just a nice gesture. It's not. We all know this. I'm talking about real human interaction, not an academic debate. This is something everyone except severely socially inept (or what's more likely here argumentative contrarians) understand. If a man is offering to buy a woman a drink, 99.9% of the time it's because he's interested in her.

So I think that in a nightclub or bar, romantic interactions are pretty superficial. It's not an environment where ""getting to know someone"" thrives, it's based on first impressions which are mostly carried by looks. If a guy is good looking a woman may be interested, if not, he's SOL. So I think by the time a man says ""Can I buy you a drink?"" she's already made that first impression judgment and knows whether or not this is someone she'd be interested in. 

What I think is rude is when that judgment is a 0 and not a 1 and the woman accepts the drink. I don't think ""leading on"" is the right term, but it's just rude to kinda give someone false hope like that when you know you have no intention of going further just because you want a drink.",External-Shop-4957,19,920,0.5099999904632568,0.17733132452673683,1706141502,/r/changemyview/comments/19evq5n/cmv_its_rude_for_a_woman_to_accept_a_mans_offer/,2024,1
190cmeb,"CMV: The Democratic Party platform of ""vote for us or lose the right to vote at all"" is not the strong ""saving democracy"" platform that party leadership seems to think it is.","Note: in this post I'm using ""democracy"" to describe any system of government where power is derived from legitimate elections. The debate about whether our representative form of government was ever a true ""democracy"" is another topic entirely.

The US has long had a two-party democratic system. Now, one of the two parties is openly un-democratic. They support a candidate who already attempted one coup to overthrow an election, and who openly wishes to be a dictator. So from my perspective, that party is no longer participating in the democratic process, which leaves us with a... one-party democracy? Is that even a democracy at all?

In 2020 Biden ran on the premise of saving democracy from Trump. Now, entering the next election, democracy seems *even farther* from ""being saved,"" and Biden is running on the same premise again. Frankly, it seems a lot like the rhetoric from self-labeled but widely accepted to be undemocratic regimes like Russia and China; ""you must vote for THE party or doom us all.""

It seems to me that the only way out of this situation is to create a viable third-party (or rather, 2nd party, if you assume that the Republicans are not participating in democracy). If the Democratic Party is serious about ""saving democracy,"" then they should be acknowledging the vast differences between their constituents (currently, anyone who still wants the US to operate as a democracy), dividing themselves into factions (sub-parties or new parties altogether), and forming a coalition of those factions to elect leaders through a democratic process (e.g. serious primary elections for president).

19a0ir3,"CMV: My teen spends much more time Online than IRL, and I believe it's an unhealthy balance that will impact his future relationships.","As a parent, I'm concerned about my 13yo son's social engagements, which is mostly online, through gaming. He has friends from school, but rarely sees them after school or on the weekends outside of school. I worry about the long-term effects on his social and emotional development as a person spending so much time online.

I'm in my late 40s, and grew up in a time before smartphones and online communities. In my experience in-person interactions benefited me greatly: getting a deeper understanding of friends through nonverbal cues, a sense of true connection with friends when you're just hanging out, and the opportunity for more meaningful conversations when there are fewer distractions around.

These things seem to be missing in my son's online interactions, which are often limited to in-game discussions about strategy, or even which game to play next, and then lack any in-depth (or even mundane talk) that happens naturally when you spend time together face-to-face. Also, he ends up meeting a variety of online-only friends and those relationships are more fleeting and never get that deep and real. I think spending more time with fewer, but real in person friends would be better for his social development. He'd have more opportunities to learn social skills - listening, empathy, resolving conflicts, social cues, etc.

I advocate for a much more balanced approach, ideally splitting his social time equally between online and offline. We already don't allow him to play games during the weekdays when school is on.

19fhzm8,CMV: No drug should “be tried by everyone at least once”,"I’ve heard it plenty of times by users, mostly referring to psychedelics but marijuana as well. I’ve tried these substances and experienced how potent they can be and alter your perceptions and outlooks for the better, but to say EVERYONE should give them a try is simply absurd.

Abusing psychedelics can lead to psychosis, HPPD, schizophrenia, worst case scenario a psychotic episode leading to death of the user or those around them. There’s a news article I saw getting popular recently about a woman having a psychotic episode off of marijuana and stabbing her boyfriend over a hundred times. 

Of course cases like these are relatively few and far between. Responsible users would take all of the necessary precautions to ensure the risk of an event like this happening is as minimal as possible, but not everyone is a responsible user. Even if you include controls like being of a mature age, having no history of mental illness in yourself or family, being in a safe environment at the time of effects, etc., the risk of mishaps is higher than 0% and must be considered.

I believe psychedelics and marijuana have the potential to give wonderful experiences and alleviate some of the stress that life carries, but these are powerful substances that must be respected, and the potential risks of everyone trying them just once outweighs the rewards.

196irbd,CMV: anyone who's serious about sustainability should change to a plant-based diet,"  
Studies have shown the best way for us to reduce deforestation, land use, fresh water use, eutrophication, and biodiversity loss is to change from omnivore diets to plant-based diets.  This is because animal agriculture is the leading driver of all of these factors, and switching to a plant-based diet can reduce them by as much as 75% (example source [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00795-w), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00343-4), [3](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216)).  Per the FAO, animal agriculture also emits more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector.  
  
We need to protect what is left of our biodiversity and change the way we interact with the environment. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) states we've lost an estimated [69%](https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/) of wild animals in the past 50 years, with losses as high as 94% in places like Latin America.  We've already changed the world so much that [96%](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1711842115) of mammalian biomass is now humans and our livestock.  
  
One of the most common rebuttals to the above is a plant-based diet isn't healthy, and therefore isn't a viable solution for sustainability.  In fact, it can be a major improvement over what many in the west are currently eating.  My country (USA) gets 150-200% of the protein we require and only [5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124841/) hit the recommended minimum daily fiber intake.  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the largest nutritional body in the world with over 112,000 experts, and [its position](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/) is a plant-based diet is healthy for all stages of life and can reduce the chances of getting the top chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers.  I say this to focus the discussion around other topics that are much more likely to change my view.

Corporations and governments won't lead the charge alone against the status quo, so it's important that we as consumers take responsibility at the same time.

The dominant diets in developed nations are based on societal and behavioral norms, but are far from optimal.  It's true that diet is a personal choice, so I hold it is better to choose a diet that is much more sustainable than what we're currently eating.

I am a progressive so there's an understandable bias on both sides, but I do feel I'm less biased and emotionally invested in this idea. I have little emotional investment in Disney and I acknowledge right wing money is a lot more plentiful and influential than left wing money.  
  
I'm not a Disney fan myself so I haven't watched much from Disney recently. The last Disney thing I did was go to Disneyland Tokyo with right wing family members.  
  
I don't perceive Disney as progressive at all. Pretty much every progressive person I know who isn't an animator hates Disney, and have hated Disney long before any right ring backlash against Disney.  
  
My perception is the MCU is too complicated for people to catch up with. That's the main reason I never watched any MCU movie aside from Guardians of the Galaxy and 2008 Iron man. Disney also quite possibly has issues of attempting to appeal to everyone and appealing to nobody, but I'm not sure about that over my lack of knowledge.  
  
I have never seen anything to particularly suggest Disney has progressive messaging in its media. The only political messages I've heard of are the really generic non-message of Black Panther and the genocide defending message of live action Mulan. I guess a bit more for their small cartoons like Owl House, but I don't see anyone suggesting Owl House had any impact on Disney's revenue.

TLDR; rather than being an epithet, being a DINO or RINO should in fact be considered a badge of honor.",SteadfastEnd,214,487,0.6399999856948853,0.14317903994200926,1704919744,/r/changemyview/comments/193ir08/cmv_america_does_not_need_fewer_dino_or_rino/,2024,1
194axin,CMV: It Should Be Illegal for Politicians to Tell Blatant Lies,"This is Trump-inspired. I was just listening to Trump speaking to reporters not five minutes ago after coming out of his civil trial in New York where he has already been found guilty of massively inflating the value of many of his properties and holdings and they are determining what the punishment/fine should be. He stood in front of reporters and stated, time and again, that ""this was the new way Democrats were stealing the elections"" and repeatedly said that all of these trials and charges he is facing are being coordinated by Biden. 

I understand that the news media can rebut these claims and can follow-up his conferences with fact-checks, but I don't think that is sufficient as he is consistently allowed a megaphone in which he can state huge, incredibly damaging lies that hurt our country and there is no reprecussion for doing so. 

I do not believe that politicians should be held liable/that it should be illegal for them to tell lies in that for example, they say they will do ""X"" for their constituents but then that doesn't happen. What I mean is it should be illegal to make such incredibly damaging and damning claims when there is literally no evidence to support it. This is because the types of claims Trump is making are the type that can lead to true disarray, hatred, anger, and potentially even civil war if allowed to carry on unpunished. 

When Trump tells people that Biden is coordinating charges against him when there is literally no evidence of this his supporters believe it. And this type of claim is the type of claim that angers and infuriates his supporters. They truly believe that the election was stolen (even though he had many, many chances in court to prove his claims and failed in every single one) and they truly believe that Biden is somehow coordinating an effort to put Trump behind bars.

The simple fact is, Trump clearly was told by many, many individuals that there was no evidence of fraud in the election but he plowed forward with ""stolen"" claims anyways. He called the Georgia secretary of state and asked him to find just enough votes for him to win. He did all these things and there are consequences. He brought this upon himself, not Biden. 

Why shouldn't it be illegal for candidates to tell these types of lies? In a world where gaslighting the public leads to true national division, can we really continue to allow such dangerous lies to be legally okay? What is the end of this type of lying? Where does it lead? It can't lead anywhere good and it infuriates me that he is allowed to just straight-up lie without consequences.

I'm genuinely curious why it's okay for candidates to do this.",VTHockey11,324,335,0.800000011920929,0.1412355431658569,1705003330,/r/changemyview/comments/194axin/cmv_it_should_be_illegal_for_politicians_to_tell/,2024,1
19d39cc,"Cmv: The houthis are not a group of freedom fighters, but rather another opportunistic Jihadist militia.","Much has been made in some circles about the role that the houthis are playing in the Gaza conflict by deliberately attacking ships in the red sea strait to try and force international pressure on the west to back down support for Israel.

However I don't see this as a noble cause by the Houthis - this is nothing more another fundamentalist religious group - accused of slavery, sex trafficking, child marriage etc that is backed by Iran - who has direct geopolitical goals to try and force a proxy conflict in the middle east.

The issue is that they're seen as being 'the only fighters for Gaza' but they're just another group using gazans being murdered as a political tool.",elderlybrain,266,408,0.7900000214576721,0.1409186785601963,1705949901,/r/changemyview/comments/19d39cc/cmv_the_houthis_are_not_a_group_of_freedom/,2024,1
