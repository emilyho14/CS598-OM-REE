1eh4u8e,"CMV: The word ""weird"" is going to destroy Trump's campaign","For those who haven't been following the election and the memes, basically the Democrats, mainstream media, and social media are attacking Trump's campaign by calling Trump / Vance and their supporters ""weird."" It's a similar tactic that Trump has used (i.e. Low Energy Jeb, Lyin Ted, Crooked Hillary, etc.). While this might sound like silly playground tactics, we've seen how well this works if the label actually sticks.

Well in this case, ""weird"" has really struck a nerve with the right wing and it's really sticking. The right wing Trump supporters have been getting really mad and angry about being called weird, like it's very tangible that it gets under their skin. Even Trump himself is not handling it very well.

In my opinion, there's 2 reasons why the word ""weird"" is making them so mad

(1) Because, let's be honest, it's true. Trump and his supporters are weird. The whole world outside of the US thinks they are weird. People in the US who aren't part of the core MAGA fanbase thinks these people are weird. Trump himself is weird. 

(2) Conservatives hate the idea of not being normal. This label doesn't work against progressives, because progressives generally embrace people who don't fit into traditional social norms. Conservatives are all about following traditional social norms, so when people start to call out that Trump and the MAGA core are abnormal oddballs, it really hits their ego.

Ok so why is this attack going to destroy Trump's campaign? Because nobody wants to sit at the lunch table with the social outcasts. Obviously the die hard Trump voters are going to vote for Trump no matter what, but basically the election is now framed as Kamala being the option for normal people and Trump being the choice for weirdos. Obviously this is whole thing is very silly and you could argue it's just name calling, but if I'm being honest, it's about time the Democrats started getting mean with their election strategies. I also think Trump and his supporters have acted like bullies for the last 8 years, so it's pretty satisfying to give them a taste of their own medicine. Call it petty, but it's an effective strategy. I might be biassed, but I really think the Democrats have found a banger political strategy with this, all it took was using Trump's own tactics against him ",CanuckP,5144,3017,0.7300000190734863,1.0,1722477159,/r/changemyview/comments/1eh4u8e/cmv_the_word_weird_is_going_to_destroy_trumps/,2024,8
1f2pjou,CMV:  Democrats are getting overconfident about the possible debate between Kamala and Trump. ,"I wanted to make this post for quite a while but couldn’t find time to respond to people who will respond to my post.

Before the first debate, I read a lot of left-wing blogs which kept saying Biden would trounce Trump in the debate.  At that time itself, I felt that he should not debate Trump because there is no benefit for him and nothing that Trump says will hurt him with his base. In other words Biden has all to lose and Trump has nothing to lose.

The debate went magnitudes worse than I had ever feared and it culminated with Biden, eventually, dropping out. 

 I now see the same thing with people eager for a Kamala vs Trump debate. I stand by my position that Trump has nothing to lose in this and Kamala has everything to lose. Trump could get on stage, crap his pants, and sling his poo at the audience and he would still not lose a single supporter. Granted, he won’t gain any supporters from such behavior either . Kamala on the other hand could make a mistake like she did against Tulsi in 2020 and could destroy the campaign as it is. 

So there you have it. That’s my view. Change it.

1evrkc0,CMV: I don't really understand why people care so much about Israel-Palestine ,"I want to begin by saying I am asking this in good faith - I like to think that I'm a fairly reasonable, well-informed person and I would genuinely like to understand why I seem to feel so different about this issue than almost all of my friends, as well as most people online who share an ideological framework to me.

I genuinely do not understand why people seem so emotionally invested in the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian Crisis. I have given the topic a tremendous amount of thought and I haven't been able to come up with an answer.

Now, I don't want to sound callous - I wholeheartedly acknowledge that what is happening in Gaza is horrifying and a genocide. I condemn the actions of the IDF in devastating a civilian population - what has happened in Gaza amounts to a war crime, as defined by international law under the UN Charter and other treaties.

However - I can say that about a huge number of ongoing global conflicts. Hundreds of of thousands have died in Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Ethiopia, Myanmar and other conflicts in this year. Tens of thousands have died in Ukraine alone. I am sad about the civilian deaths in all these states, but to a degree I have had to acknowledge that this is simply what happens in the world. I am also sad and outraged by any number of global injustices. Millions of women and girls suffer from sex trafficking networks, an issue my country (Canada) is overtly complicit in failing to stop (Toronto being a major hub for trafficking). Children continued to be forced into labour under modern slavery conditions to make the products which prop up the Western world. Resource exploitation in Africa has poisoned local water supplies and resulted in the deaths of infants and pregnant women all so that Nestle and the Coca Cola Company can continue exporting sugary bullshit to Europe and North America.

All this to say, while the Israel-Palestinian Crisis is tragic, all these other issues are also tragic, and while I've occasionally donated to a cause or even raised money and organized fundraisers for certain issues like gender equality in Canada or whatnot, I have mostly had to simply get on with my life, and I think that's how most people deal with the doomscrolling that is consuming news media in this day and age.

Now, I know that for some people they feel they have a more personal stake in the Israel-Palestine Crisis because their country or institution plays an active role in supporting the aggressor. But even on that front, I struggle to see how this particular situation is different than others - the United States and by proxy the rest of the Western world has been a principal actor in destabilizing most of the current ongoing global crises for the purpose of geopolitical gain. If anyone has ever studied any history of the United States and its allies in the last hundred years, they should know that we're not usually on the side of the good guys, and frankly if anyone has ever studied international relations they should know that in most conflicts all combatants are essentially equally terrible to civilian populations. The active sale of weapons and military support to Israel is also not particularly unique - the United States and its allies fund war pretty much everywhere, either directly or through proxies. Also, in terms of active responsibility, purchasing any good in a Western country essentially actively contributes to most of the global inequality and exploitation in the world.

Now, to be clear, I am absolutely not saying ""everything sucks so we shouldn't try to fix anything."" Activism is enormously important and I have engaged in a lot of it in my life in various causes that I care about. It's just that for me, I focus on causes that are actively influenced by my country's public policy decisions like gender equality or labour rights or climate change - international conflicts are a matter of foreign policy, and aside from great powers like the United States, most state actors simply don't have that much sway. That's even more true when it comes to institutions like universities and whatnot.

In summary, I suppose by what I'm really asking is why people who seem so passionate in their support for Palestine or simply concern for the situation in Gaza don't seem as concerned about any of these other global crises? Like, I'm absolutely not saying ""just because you care about one global conflict means you need to care about all of them equally,"" but I'm curious why Israel-Palestine is the issue that made you say ""no more watching on the side lines, I'm going to march and protest.""

Like, I also choose to support certain causes more strongly than others, but I have reasons - gender equality fundamentally affects the entire population, labour rights affects every working person and by extension the sustainability and effective operation of society at large, and climate change will kill everyone if left unchecked. I think these problems are the most pressing and my activism makes the largest impact in these areas, and so I devote what little time I have for activism after work and life to them. **I'm just curious why others have chosen the Israel-Palestine Crisis as their hill to die on, when to me it seems 1. similar in scope and horrifyingness to any number of other terrible global crises and 2. not something my own government or institutions can really affect (particularly true of countries outside the United States).**

Please be civil in the comments, this is a genuine question. **I am not saying people shouldn't care about this issue or that it isn't important that people are dying** - I just want to understand and see what I'm missing about all this.",wellthatspeculiar,1500,2278,0.6700000166893005,0.5233282781707185,1724036641,/r/changemyview/comments/1evrkc0/cmv_i_dont_really_understand_why_people_care_so/,2024,8
1ex7bwp,"CMV: There is no justification for the October 7th attack by Hamas, it was a terrorist attack, committed by a terrorist organisation and should be condemned ","I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not supporting what Israel and the IDF are doing and I condemn all the war crimes that they commit, however this seems to be causing people to overlook the other side of the conflict.

While I am sure that a lot of the pro Palestinian protestors don't support Hamas, or the 7th October attack and are just supporting the innocent civilians who are caught and killed in the crossfire of the Israel/Palestine war, however there seems to be a growing number that do, and it should be a security concern in all countries, that there is growing support for Hamas which is a recognised terrorist organisation.

From my view, the October 7th attack is one of the worst terrorist attacks in history, it was an attack on civilians, and if the population size between the US and Israel are scaled equally, it is many times worse than the 9/11 attacks (and not just in death toll).

A lot of pro Palestinian protestors seem to always fail to answer (yes/no) if they are asked if they condemn the October 7th attack or Hamas and usually do one of the following:

1.  Start talking about what Israel has done and the civilians they have killed to deflect the question 

As I mentioned at the start, I absolutely condemn and am against what Israel has done to civilians, however this should never justify any attack on civilians, when this argument is used this is often spun as an ""oppressed people fighting back"" narrative, and while I agree that the Palestinian people have definitely been oppressed, the October 7th attack is not how oppressed people fight back, oppressed people do not brutally attack civilians, victims of the Nazi's holocaust did not start brutally attacking German civilians, and I think most can agree that German civilians did not deserve to suffer after WW2 because of what the Nazi's did.

2. Outright denial the attack ever took place/claims no civilians were killed 

I don't really have anything to say that people who genuinely think the attack never happened other than that Hamas recorded themselves doing this attack for the world to see, has made their intentions clear that this attack is what they wanted, and that they will do it again. (Very few genuinely believe the attacks never happened, but there are some)

3. Israel knew about the attack / let it happen / didn't respond to it to use it as justification for the war

I am not certain about the truth of Israel's knowledge of the attack, and I don't think we could ever be certain of it and I don't deny that the above could be true. Regardless, this can't justify the killing of innocent civilians who certainly did not know they would be killed that day, this is like saying the Nazi's were justified in killing civilians in France and Poland when they invaded, because the French and Polish governments could've easily known that Hitler intended to invade and commit genocide many years before. 

Overall, I think Hamas must absolutely be eliminated and destroyed once and for all, and Israel has a right to defend itself from Hamas, but Israel and the IDF needs to also be held accountable for war crimes against civilians, and there needs to be a clear distinction between pro Palestine supporters who only want to support the innocent civilians vs the Hamas supporters who are supporting a terrorist organisation, otherwise we could reach a very scary point where extremism on all sides of all conflicts is already rising, where a large number on both sides will support/justify the killing of civilians.",Le_Corporal,1076,2399,0.6499999761581421,0.502168247221164,1724188682,/r/changemyview/comments/1ex7bwp/cmv_there_is_no_justification_for_the_october_7th/,2024,8
1epsqlh,CMV:  Democrats aren't taking the possibility of losing the election seriously enough!,"It seems like since the assassination attempt on Trump didn't boost his numbers, Harris became the nominee, and declared Walz her running mate, democrats have acted like everything magically flipped, and now they're more likely to win.  This is how we got 2016.  They need to be really pushing the narrative that only by every  person specifically actually voting, and preferably doing more than that, do they even have a chance at winning.  Especially since a close election resulting in a win still may not be enough to actually win it.  I believe democrats are being entirely too recklessly optimistic, and it could result in voters skipping the election which could easily result in a loss.

1eivpyy,"CMV: i understand the ""man or bear"" problem, yet it's still inherently mysandrist ","

So, at least in my opinion, I think I understand the ""man or bear"" thing, some women feel so in danger that they prefer the objectively more dangerous option to a man, so the mature emotional response would be to understand them and help them get over their social ""trauma"" (probably an improper term sry), meanwhile laughing at them doesn't really help anyone.

BUT it's still inherently Mysandrist and shouldn't be accepted; men do commit the majority of violent act and the majority of sexual assault, that is a mathematical fact, but its also a mathematical fact that (at least in the US, I'm not American but I'll use america as an example) black people commit a lot more crimes than white people per Capita yet a phrase such as ""better to be locked up with a gorilla than with a black man"" would be seen, rightfully so, as racist and this phrase would be rejected 

Therefore just because a minority of men commit horrible, and victims have a right to their suffering and should be helped, it doesn't make mysandry acceptable",FAbbibo,0,2699,0.5,0.44729864103413985,1722663524,/r/changemyview/comments/1eivpyy/cmv_i_understand_the_man_or_bear_problem_yet_its/,2024,8
1epa315,CMV: Most Muslims only care about Islamophobia when it’s done by “the West” or by “the Jews”,"Islam, despite the fact that the most populous Muslim nation on the planet is in Southeast Asia, is still haunted by a profound thread of arab chauvinism. It’s been this way since the beginning when you see conflicts in North Africa between the indigenous Amazigh and the invading Arabs that conquered the land. Arabs were given preferential treatment, their Islam was more pure, their language more civilized. 

The Amazigh were barbarians being rescued by the Arabs and the Prophet and raised to civilization. 

Today not much as changes. Arabic is still used in almost every mosque on the planet, regardless of the languages of the region, most imams are Arabic and the Muslim world is still generally oriented around Muslims. It’s why whenever there’s any news about injustice being done to Muslims in America or in Gaza you’ll see massive protests among Arab Muslims in those same western countries or even, despot the dangers, the repressive theocracies of the Middle East. 

Yet notice how they never make a peep over the blatantly anti-Muslim tactics of China or the Rohingya in Myanmar? That’s because they’re just some Asians to them that happen to be go to a mosque. Not Muslims with caring about. Not Muslims worth caring about when compared to the idea of THE JEWS OR THE US oppressing them.

1enf4mh,CMV: Kamala's shutdown of hecklers at her Detroit rally can't reasonably be interpreted as a stance on Palestine,"The timeline as I understand it: 

* Kamala met with the protest group and talked to them prior to the speech.
* The protesters get rowdy and disruptive during the speech and Kamala reminds them that, while they have a voice, it's her time to speak.
* They persist and she shuts them down more harshly
* People who didn't think it through, didn't know the context, or just don't care make a big deal out of it and try to shame her and everyone else as being ""pro genocide"" as if those were related.

So basically, I want to know what possible perspective or information I missed that makes this wrong. There certainly seem to be a lot of people (bots?) who are just going nuts over this issue turning all their frustration and hostility about the middle east against Kamala and anyone who points out that this was about interruptions, not anything else.

What would change my view - information that changes the context of what happened, some other reasoning that what she said could reasonably be interpreted the way some people are taking it.

1et0lpa,"CMV: most criticism of ""incels"" is useless/unproductive because it relies too heavily on a just world fallacy. ","To start off. When I say ""Incel"" I mean the dictionary definition ""involuntary celibate"" somebody who wants a sexual relationship but for whatever reason is struggling or incapable of finding one. 

And the fact that I have to place a clear definition here is part of my view. Most of the conversations I see regarding incels turn into semantic arguments because people have a very specific stereotype in mind of a ""misogynistic overweight neckbeard who doesn't bathe and hates women because they don't want to sleep with him"" 

This I feel relies too heavily on a just world fallacy that dictates that these people must inherently be struggling due to personal/moral failings. Because if they weren't misogynistic/unhygienic/antisocial they wouldn't be having difficulties. 

I feel as though the world is not so just. And that there is a silent majority of incels who are struggling to find partners due to issues like neurodivergence and unhealthy or unrealistic standards placed on men (aka, toxic masculinity) in the realm of dating. 

As such, the advice most frequently given to this group to ""shower more"" and ""treat women like people"" is redundant and not at all helpful. Because it comes from a place of presumption based in the aforementioned just world fallacy. Because society at large isn't really willing to admit that mens success in dating is still predicated on successfully performing the same outdated male gender roles as 50 years ago.

1f4aebw,CMV: The 'both sides are do nothing corporate stooges' attitude that many far leftists hold is wrong and dangerous,"I've seen a lot of people on the far left saying that Democrats and Republicans are very similar and both doing the bidding of their corporate masters. 

As a Democrat, I vehemently disagree. I do acknowledge that large corporations contribute a significant amount to Democrat campaigns, but Democrats have also passed-and tried to pass- policies that limit corporate power. 

For example, reducing the cost of insulin. Big pharma doesn't want those limits.

Democrats attempted to pass build back better but a now independent and another now independent allowed it to fail. That was major legislation that would have helped a lot of people and Democrats fought tooth and nail to pass it. 

Democrats have also implemented additional regulations around things like food safety. This does not help big corporations in the slightest. 

That's why I think the attitude is wrong. I think it's dangerous because of two far more critical differences. 

First one side is trying to undermine Democracy while the other is trying to protect it. And the idea that at the end of the day both parties are do nothing corporate stooges completely misses the very real threat of somebody who will not concede even when it appears they know they've lost. 

Second, one side is going to great lengths to fight a major existential threat-climate change- and the other seems to still be dragging their feet. And while I think Democrats need to do way more to fight climate change, at least they have passed policies to help with that. 

To be clear, my view isn't that the far left thinks the two parties are identical. My concern is that they're being grouped and this makes it seem like what's happening right now is normal politics. The GOP is its own nightmarish thing right now, something highly unprecedented and dangerous. If dangerous individuals are seen as just more corrupt candidates in a two party system, then that makes it seem like they're a reasonable but not great choice. Not an aspiring dictator.

For example, the idea that an immoral CEO will be voted out of power. It seems to me that an immoral CEO will use their power to influence/interfere with the vote. The idea that they're going to play fair seems bizarre to me

Also, the idea that the leader of the socialist society- typically whoever led the rebellion- is going to do the right thing.

1emk4vd,"CMV: Saying ""Tax the rich"" and then discussing income tax is a misinformative bait and switch.","As far as I know there is not a single person who became a billionaire primarily through income. Every billionaire became a billionaire by buying or inheriting some asset (property, land, stock, etc.) that increased in value to a billion+ dollars. 

I suspect this is also true for the majority of millionaires, saving up a million dollars through income is doable, but there are loads of people who just bought homes in CA or in big cities in the 70s and are now millionaires through housing inflation. 

Also this is tangential to my main view, but I think someone who made a million in income has 'earned' their wealth way more than someone who just got into an asset market at the right time or is snowballing generational family wealth. 

I understand that there are practical problems with taxing asset wealth

* Evaluating how much an asset is worth isn't easy. 
* Taxing someone based on their asset might force them to sell the asset, which might drive its value down and create a lot of other problems.
* People with a lot of asset wealth would probably just move somewhere else to avoid the taxes. 

(I also think [land value taxes](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty) solve a lot of these problems in an elegant way.) 

However instead of discussing any of this, what I see a lot of people in political discussions do instead is just fall back on income taxes as if they're a real way of combating wealth inequality. When I see politicians go ""We need to address wealth inequality, here's my proposal to increase income taxes on people making over <X> a year"" it just feels like a sleazy way to give the appearance of doing something to people who are angry about wealth inequality but don't know much about it. Maybe this is overly cynical but at best it seems like a way for old money to keep out new money.

It would be different if someone requested, for example, an LGBT themed cake (like with the rainbow flag on it).

1ejeap5,CMV: American Politics Alienate Moderates,"I live in a swing state so maybe this issue isn't relatable to non-swing states. I consider myself politicly moderate and the I have never felt more alienated. Political ideologies between democrat and republican are more polarizing than ever, and if I make the mistake of speaking of anything remotely political during an election year to someone who affiliates themselves with either party as soon as I express a viewpoint that is contrary to theirs's they act like I may as well be burning down the capitol. Most political ads focus on tearing down their opposition instead of their plans or policies. I know some of this is a result of first past the post voting, and it's a combination of this and the electoral college that makes my vote and viewpoint in politics feel alienated. I also can empathize with the fact that being blue or red in a non-swing state that is the opposite color can make voting feel even more pointless. I believe in democracy, but I feel like the nature of politics is driving a wedge between people that's hurting us as a whole.

I know a lot of this is subjective... but I really do want this viewpoint of mine to change and this seems to be the place on reddit for that.

1erlpti,"CMV: A lot of incels have standards for a partner that are not in-line with their own value. They could date people, they just don't want to date the people that they could reasonably attract. ","My post is going to focus specifically on male incels FYI. 

So if there's a man out there that in general women would perceive as low value on the dating market, I do believe that they're generally not going to be able to attract a partner that is higher value than them. 

However, there are also women that are perceived as low value by men and many of these women would like to have a long-term partner, potentially get married, have kids, etc. 

Who do incels think these women are marrying if not men that are equally perceived as low value on the dating market? 

I think a common thought amongst incels is that these low value women are able to date ""out of their league"" because higher value men are most willing to do that. I think that's probably true but I think that most of the time those relationships are short-term in nature which leads me back to my original question, who are these women marrying? They're marrying other people that are of a similar value or slightly higher as them.

What is preventing incels from just lowering their standards? Lower them, give it a try, if you don't have any success then guess what your standards are probably still too high. 

If I have a car that I want to sell for $X amount and I attract no potential buyers then I'm not involuntary unable to sell my car, my expectations are just not in-line with the reality of the market. 

I think it's pretty certain that a lot of incels would have to lower their standards to such a point where they would no longer be interested in dating the people they could reasonably attract. However, does that make you involuntary celibate? That sounds voluntary to me because you would be making the choice that you are not interested in dating the people that it's possible for you to date. 

TLDR: Incels need to lower their standards. There are plenty of women out there that are also perceived as low value out there that are looking for long-term relationships and they generally will end up with a partner of a similar value to many incels.

Most rich countries have been maintained population stability/growth through immigration, but countries like Japan and South are unfortunately headed for a slow decline and demise. Immigration isn’t a long term solution to this problem though, since the entire world’s fertility rate is projected to drop below 2.1 by the end of the century, and there will be very few countries left with fertility rates above 2.1. 

Eventually the world economy will go the way of Japan and South Korea, and there’s really no good solution that can prevent this.

1exwwiv,CMV: gifted programs should not be removed from any STATE. ,"The Seattle school district and many other left-leaning states are planning to remove gifted programs for children due to a lack of racial representation in these programs. I believe this is unjustified and doesn’t make sense. It would be like making professional athletes go back to playing in an academy.

As someone who was part of a gifted program in high school, I found that regular schoolwork wasn’t challenging or engaging. It made me dread going to school, as it felt like placing an adult in a kindergarten class to learn 1+1 and expecting them to be excited about it for the next three years.

It’s also unfair to teachers and administrators, who are expected to adapt and create convoluted curricula for each individual when students are not separated by performance. They’re already underpaid and are being further burdened by the government to do extra work.

What happened to academic meritocracy? Why are we equating racial segregation with intellectual segregation?

Imagine if sports teams had similar policies, where instead of always picking the best players, they had to meet a racial quota.

Some might argue that gifted students have greater access to resources, which allows them to perform better in school, making it unfair for them to access better education and opportunities. But that same logic could be applied in reverse to any aspiring athlete: If someone had better access to equipment, nutrition, and trainers, should they also be excluded from gifted athlete programs?

No taxes on tips means lower Social Security earnings, which will reduce benefit payments when workers retire. 

I don't see a benefit to this proposal bc restaurant workers are often in the lowest tax brackets, so their taxes are usually minimal and their taxable earnings are often reduced to under $20,000 and offset by things like the earned income credit and child tax credits.  

While a few extra in tax savings seems like a great idea, in the long-run it is bad bc of reduced payroll tax receipts and reduced Social Security benefits for restaurant workers.  Please CMV.

I've seen this a number of times near me: a patron at a bar or restaurant sneaks a puff from their vape as soon as the bartender or server turns their back. It's easier to do, since it's quicker than lighting a cigarette and the vape pen can dispense just one puff unlike a cigarette. Clearly they know it's not allowed, or they wouldn't take measures to hide it too. 

The only argument I've heard is that ""it's just water vapor"", but that's just not true. The vape smoke has nicotine in it (that's sort of the point), as well as other chemicals to give it it's flavor/scent.

It may not be common knowledge, but the chemicals themselves have harmful effects on the lungs. If the smoker isn't aware of that, that might be (comparatively) understandable. However, they should be well-aware of the second-hand nicotine smoke they're blowing at people. Ignoring this seems selfish, and therefore dickish.

1eugkeu,"CMV: ""States' Rights"" has never been an argument for freedom; instead, it has been used to oppress people.","##The Founding.  


In the US, the phrase ""states' rights"" has been used at times to call for a limitation on the power of the federal government. For those outside the US, our government is comprised of ""states"" which are supposed to be sovereign entities united under a ""federal"" government.  

In theory, this distinction was supposed to ensure that each U.S. state could operate as its own territory with its own government. The ""federal"" government was envisioned as some kind of entity which could both serve to unite the states and protect them on a more continental or global scale, and to bind them together locally so that each US state could consider its neighbors as allies and fellow citizens of some kind. 

This has, of course, *always* been a messy, imprecise concept. From the very beginning, the framers and anyone knowledgeable about governments disagreed on what the roles of these entities was supposed to be. We started, of course, with a failed concept known as ""The Articles of Confederation"" which was supposed to serve the same role as above but was entirely too weak to accomplish anything at all. The framers of the US constitution, it turned out, realized that any government entity **needed** to have enough power to actually assert its will over the people and territories, otherwise it simply couldn't. 

So the Articles of Confederation were a failure. It was an attempt to ensure the sovereignty of the states by limiting the power of a federal government, but that limitation proved to be its demise as absolutely nothing of meaning could be accomplished, rendering the system pointless.

##States' Rights and Slavery.  


So the state delegates got together to change them, but instead scrapped them entirely and wrote the US Constituion. This established the current United States of America. Among the debates and disagreements at that time was the issue of slavery. And what did they do? They ""compromised"" in the spirit of ""states' rights."" 

It was argued that the southern states had ""a right"" to practice slavery if those in control of those state governments wanted to do so. And those in charge of those state govenments were white slaveowning men. So of course, *they* decided what their ""states' rights"" were to be. 

#The concept of ""States' Rights"" has never been used - nor has it ever been needed - to expand human rights; instead, it has been used primarily to divide humanity and oppress marginalized groups.  

##States' Rights and Abortion.  


The phrase has been used in countless political debates, but few as conspicuously as the question of slavery. Most recently, it has been used on the question of abortions. 

 *Roe v Wade* was a Supreme Court case decided in 1973 which established that a person has an inherent right to privacy in their medical treatment to Due Process under the 14th Amendment. In general, this is the case which prevented US states from passing laws that restricted abortion. 

Come to *Dobbs v Women's Health*, the 2022 Supreme Court decision, and *Roe* is completely overturned. And on what basis? In large part, that the question of abortion *should be decided by the states.* This notion of ""states' rights"" was in the majority opinion, it was in the oral arguments, and it was flung around by media pundits and repeated by the casual conservatives celebrating the decision. 

***""States' Rights.""***

But what interest does ""a state"" have to ""rights?"" A state is nothing more than an abstract entity comprised of people making decisions ""as a state."" Why should ""a state"" have more authority to make decisions than a ""federal government?"" Why is that intrinsically more just than either a federal government or an individual? 

In short, it isn't. Pushing abortion to the states means pushing abortion to many legislatures that are interested in oppressing women, just as pushing ""slavery"" to the states was nothing more than pushing slavery to legislatures interested in oppressing people with African ancestry. It's a cushion; a dodge; an abdication of responsibility for deciding what is just in this country. 

If the federal government is infringing on ""states' rights"" by restricting abortions, how in the ever-loving ***fuck*** is a state not infringing on women's rights by restricting abortions? 

##States' Rights and the Electoral College.  

The Electoral College (EC) is another example of asserting that ""states"" should.have power, but not individuals. It was established in the US constitution in conjunction with the 3/5 compromise, which determined that enslaved people would count ""as 3/5 of a person"" in the state for the purposes of population count, representation in Congress, and therefore, in the Electoral College for presidential elections.  

Modern arguments in favor of the EC often say that the states with smaller populations would be forgotten and their interests ignored if it were abolished. This ensures ""the states"" all have their interests heard. But that is what *Congress* is for. The states with smaller populations *already have* representation in both the House of Representatives *and* the Senate. Both of which give greater weight to less densely populated (and, coincidentally, conservative) areas.  

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in the vote for president than *the people?* 

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in governing abortion than the people who can get pregnant?  

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in protecting slavery than the people who are being enslaved?

The answer is that the logic is unsound, because the question of ""states' rights"" has always been a messy and logically inconsistent affair. 

If you want to make a case for limiting government, do so without permitting lower-level governments to oppress people.

So here I am dredging it up again, like an insane person. First, some priors about the hypothetical I'm addressing: 

* Let's discount the oft-cited cube square law which posits that a horse-sized duck would immediately collapse under its own weight. In the spirit of the hypothetical, let's assume physically viable animals whose strength and bone strength etc. has scaled linearly with their mass to allow for normal function. 
* Let's assume we have no weapons, or at least no sophisticated, pre-made weapons. I'm working from an assumption that we're totally unarmed, but if you want to argue a situation where we could pick up a stick or a rock or something I'm happy to engage with that as well. 
* You are allowed to wear normal clothing, e.g. let's say you are given 10 minutes in a normal department store to pick out an outfit. I'd be okay entertaining a scenario where you're naked, too. My main point is that you don't have access to armor or anything (though i think having armor would make the answer even more obvious.) 
* The animals in question fully understand that they are in a fight to the death against you. 
* The question is very specifically about who you think you are most likely to defeat; any questions about gaining glory or other social consequences are outside the scope of this argument. 

Okay so on to my position: 

**Picking a horse-sized duck is not only obviously wrong, it's downright foolish.** 

Let's start by focusing on the horse-sized duck and (an incomplete list of) the opportunities it has to kill us vs. how we could kill it:

* The duck would be *much* stronger than you - strong enough to break your bones with a peck or claw attack. Strong enough to kill you outright with a properly-landed blow. 
* The duck's beak is huge, rigid, and would be capable of devastating bludgeoning damage. 
* The duck's beak would be plenty big enough to grab you by the head, a limb, even your torso. 
* The duck's beak would likewise be able to bite you with great force, possibly enough to break your bones. 
* The duck has claws on its feet that it could use to rip you open. 
* The duck can *fucking fly*. And even if we agree for some reason that it can't, it's still a massive animal that can kill you in a single blow. 
* You have basically no method to kill the duck unarmed. Maaaybe you could get lucky and break one of its legs, but you're still left with an extremely large, angry animal that can easily break your bones by just flailing around. The duck's neck is too large and strong to be choked out. Possibly you could stuff yourself or objects down its throat until it chokes? But even then, you are attempting a precise maneuver against a massive animal that is also trying to kill you. 

Now to contrast let's examine the duck-sized horses:

* The horses would be *much* weaker than you - any individual horse would be unable to do much more than lightly push you a bit. 
* The horses' mouths, while formidable in a horse-sized animal, would be too small to even gain purchase on most of your body. When naked, you'd run the risk of maybe getting the tip of a toe or finger bit off, or maybe a light pinch on your shinbone or something. If you were could dress yourself, wearing basically any clothes at all would render you nigh-invulnerable to this attack. 
* That leaves their kicks, which would be an annoyance but unlikely to do any real harm besides light scratches and bruises. Their hooves are not particularly sharp and are certainly not designed to puncture or rip skin. The blunt-force damage that makes a normal horse so dangerous would be rendered basically moot by their relatively small size and lack of strength. 
* Horses are not particularly intelligent animals and are not capable of any kind of meaningful tactical collaboration. This massively mitigates the potential problem posed by the large number of horses. 
* Similarly, horses cannot climb or grapple you, so your exposure would be limited to a few horses at any given time. This fact, combined with the previous point, means that there is very little threat of being overwhelmed and dragged down. At least until you have already worn yourself out to the point of exhaustion. 
* Horse legs are notoriously spindly and fragile. While scaling them down would reduce the risk of broken legs, it would still be pretty easy to break their limbs and incapacitate them. 
* You could kill or at least incapacitate the horses with normal kicks and stomps. You could easily pick up a horse and snap its neck, especially given the extra leverage offered by their long heads. A hundred is a pretty big number, but every individual horse would be trivially easy to defeat. The main challenge here is cardio, not fighting skill. 

Please note: I am NOT saying that I, or anyone, would obviously defeat 100 duck-sized horses every time. I am very specifically talking about the choice between 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck: on this question, I think the average human has about a 99% better chance of defeating the horses than they do the duck and I seriously question the judgment of anyone who picks the alternative.",tsaihi,630,433,0.8799999952316284,0.13299641842931528,1724520014,/r/changemyview/comments/1f0aj6r/cmv_in_the_would_you_rather_fight_100_ducksized/,2024,8
1esk1k8,CMV: Dogs shouldn’t be welcomed everywhere,"Tonight I went to an outdoor concert under the summer sky. Gorgeous evening at twilight attended by about 30 people. 3 guests brought their dogs. The dogs were barking throughout the performance, about 1 bark/min. It really punctuated the atmosphere. (Importantly, this was a free orchestra concert, we didn’t pay to be there.)

One lady kept turning to her dog and saying “No…” Lady. IT’S A DOG. It doesn’t understand. I love that my fellow millennials strive to be nonjudgmental but one upshot of this is that when we violate social norms, maybe we won’t be corrected. Sticking around with your barking dogs at the expense of everyone else was not cool.

1ehibx3,"CMV: If you don’t even vote in your local elections, then you have no right to bitch and moan about national/global politics.","I will never comprehend the egregious levels of self-important cuntiness it takes for people (especially on this platform, but elsewhere too) to make political ideology the largest facet of their personality, while taking absolutely zero action within their own sphere of influence.

You are not important enough nor are you educated enough for your perspective on geopolitics / macroeconomics to matter one fucking bit. Don’t flatter yourself. You care so much about these things because you lack a sense of control in your personal life, and pontificating about things much larger than you is simply a mechanism for escapism. Herein lies the truth of your mental illness masquerading as virtue and competence.

You chose to focus on large-scale issues for several reasons. First, the more wide-reaching the scope, the more morally superior you get to feel about yourself for caring about it. More accurately, being *seen* to care about it. To that end, national/global issues have a larger community surrounding them, which is a necessity for placating your narcissism. How else would everyone else know how wonderful of a person you are? And, the biggest reason of all:

You only care about large issues because you know that you have, and will always have, exactly zero impact on the outcome. As long as that’s true, you can skirt any sense of responsibility when it comes to making a difference. You get to have all the emotional feel-goods of being part of a cause, without ever having to contribute any effort. You avoid smaller-scale issues because you could actually do something about them. This would create a sense of responsibility that spoils any and all appeal. Since you have no ability to impact the outcome of far-reaching policies, your opinions and ideas have no need to be based in reality either, since they’ll never be tried. Your ideas don’t have to actually make any sense or have any chance in hell or working. All they have to do is come with some sort of virtuous vibe to get you the sense of moral superiority you crave.

For the vast majority of people (99.999%) your ideas are not novel. In fact, someone more powerful than you probably told you what to think, so you’re not a free-thinking genius either just because you hold some radical, contrarian opinion.

This is not to say that you are not allowed to have opinions on national / global issues. You absolutely can. What you cannot do though, is paint yourself as this bastion of human decency, focusing only on abstract bullshit you have no control over, all the while ignoring the parts of our flawed society that you can influence.

At the end of the day, it does not matter one fucking bit to the average person who is president. Your personal life will be impacted much more directly by the mayor of your town, your county’s board members, and the president of your local school board.

Until you’ve done your part to make a deference in those areas, shut the FUCK up about Ukraine, Israel, China, the military-industrial complex, Wall Street, gas prices, inflation, “capitalism,” “communism,” “socialism,” and UBI.",statisticalmean,499,485,0.6700000166893005,0.12888096922003928,1722523157,/r/changemyview/comments/1ehibx3/cmv_if_you_dont_even_vote_in_your_local_elections/,2024,8
1euk12y,CMV: Marxism doesn’t *have* to be authoritarian,"
A lot of people conflate marxism with communist authoritarianism, I want to address this issue. Marxism, in my opinion, has historically been a victim of ideological bad faith, both regarding the regimes that touted its philosophies and the regimes that contested (and thwarted) its proliferation elsewhere. I would challenge people to find Marx’s descriptions on class, value, or politics that are inherently authoritarian. If you can’t and instead you choose to believe that the practical evocation of marxism will always be authoritarian, even if the ideology isn’t, then my challenge would be to delineate why it’s an ideological issue. 

The Soviet Union, for example, stole the spirit of Marxism but never actually implemented its theories. Lenin tried to forcefully evoke Marxism by creating what he called a political ‘vanguard,’ which launched a coup and basically called his communist, fascist government ‘marxist-Leninism.’ Not to mention Russia at the time was suffering from immensely embedded political corruption and was also suffering economic loss and political sabotage from drawn out competition with the Western world. Here’s an example, alongside many, of marxism failing not due to marxist ideology, but due to geopolitical conditions when attempting to bring about marxist ideology (especially if it’s done in bad faith, how the nazi socialist party was to socialism) which ultimately failed in ever achieving a reflection of marxism. 

If marxism was evoked through grassroots organization in a gradual manner, something that needs time and can’t be necessarily forced, I believe it wouldn’t need to be corrupted by authoritarianism (which is inherently anti-marxist).

1em8hr4,cmv: abortion should be a right,"I want to share my perspective on abortion and why I believe it should be a right. To provide some context about me: I am personally pro-life (even though I am a man). If I were to father a child, I would commit to taking responsibility and supporting the child as best as I can, assuming the woman decides to keep the baby.

However, I also believe that I do not have the right to dictate what a woman does with her own body. If a woman becomes pregnant and is not in a position to safely and effectively care for a child, it would be wrong to force her to do so. Mandating childbirth in such situations can lead to a difficult life for both the mother and the child.

I’d like to hear different perspectives and have a respectful discussion about why or why not abortion should be considered a fundamental right.

1ehn4hl,cmv: Calling adults pedophiles for dating other adults have always been crazy to me.,"I just witnessed this man get called a pedophile because he’s 27 years old dating and 21 year old. I also witnessed another man get called a pedophile for dating a 26 year old at the age of 35.

Pedophiles are a group of individuals who are adults or older adolescent that experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.

This misapplication not only misrepresents the nature of these relationships but also dilutes the gravity of actual pedophilia, potentially undermining efforts to protect children from sexual abuse.

The age gap police need to calm down. It's understandable to want to protect younger partners from being taken advantage of, but labeling someone a predator just because their relationship doesn't fit your narrow view of what an age gap should be is unreasonable. This kind of reaction is excessive and unfair.

Two people of the same age can be at different stages of life due to various factors such as career paths, educational pursuits, personal choices, and life experiences. For instance, one 25-year-old might be advancing in a corporate career and contemplating home ownership, while another might still be in school, exploring different job opportunities, or traveling the world. 

Conversely, two individuals aged 21 and 29 can be in the same stage of life if their circumstances and life choices align. Both might be recent graduates starting their first full-time jobs, exploring new cities, or beginning to establish their independence and build their careers. These examples illustrate that life stages are not strictly bound by chronological age but are influenced by individual experiences and goals.",Unique-Technology924,659,316,0.8500000238418579,0.11642511383136822,1722534853,/r/changemyview/comments/1ehn4hl/cmv_calling_adults_pedophiles_for_dating_other/,2024,8

It’s almost like hearing god wanted your child to die, now look to him for guidance through your grief. These people usually say “everything god does is for a reason” or “god works in mysterious ways”. Then when a family does receive support from a Good Samaritan they’ll say god sent them. I understand most people who say things like this are trying to console the grieving family, but in my experience it just adds an extra layer of hate.

1f4roqi,CMV: The binding of Isaac in the Bible perfectly illustrates the problem with religious fanatism,"I am refering to [the story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac), first mentionned in the Hebrew bible and present in the religious texts of the 3 abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity an Islam).

In this story, God orders Abraham to sacrifice his only son to him as a test of faith. Abraham agree but is stopped at the last moment by an angel sent by God who tell him to sacrifice a ram instead.

One prevalent moral can be made for this narrative, faith in God must be absolute and our love for him must be equal to none, even superior to our own flesh and blood.

Which lead to two critisims I have, one directly tied to this tale and the abrahamic religions and the second about religious fanatism in general:

1. God is considered benevolent or even omnibenevolent (meaning he has an unlimited amount of benevolence) by his followers. That story (yet another...) directly contradict that fact as it depict him as egoistic, jealous, tyranic and cruel by giving such an horrible task for Abraham to perform. How can he remain worshiped if we have such depiction of him in the scriptures.
2. Considering God as more important and deserving more love than any of our relative is a way of thinking that I despise profondly. I don't consider having a place for spirituality in our live being a bad thing in itself but when it become much more prevalent than the ""material world"" it's when it can easily derail. Because when we lose our trust in the tangible and concret concepts we can basically believe anything and everything without regard as how crazy and dangerous it can be. After the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo occured, I remember listening to an interview with a muslim explaining how terrible insulting the prophet is for him because his love and respect of him are even greater than the one he have for his own family. How can this be an healthy belief ? How can this be compatible with our current society ?

I choosed this story because it seems to be quite prevalent in the abrahamic religions and displays how far one's faith can go. If you consider that God is so benevolent, his word absolutes and thus him ordering someone to kill his child is acceptable, there is something wrong with you.",vuzz33,215,565,0.6899999976158142,0.1145341960616125,1725012890,/r/changemyview/comments/1f4roqi/cmv_the_binding_of_isaac_in_the_bible_perfectly/,2024,8

I honestly don't think Trump knows what to do and I'm not convinced he'll figure it out before the election. What is funny, is that other Republican candidates had an idea that this would happen and yet Trump seems to have been caught completely and utterly off guard by Biden deciding to pass the torch.

I also believe she'll carry Democrats over the finish line in both the Senate and the House. The reason I say this is similar to the 2016 election is because this election comes at a time of uncertainty. Trump represents what Clinton represented in 2016. A product of a political system that most Americans think needs washing. Harris now is what Trump was in 2016. This isn't like 2020 where Democrats were of course happy to vote Biden in but weren't all that enthused about him.

Almost all Muslims discussing i have seen on the internet and in real time say that homosexuality is a sin and are very intolerant of it.

1) home prices will raise directly commensurate with any subsidy. Sellers know there's excess free cash and will seek to capture.

2) Subsidies will flow directly to current homeowners offloading property or to developers who were sitting on property and seeing land prices skyrocket. 

3) tax payers are ultimately footing the bill of government expenses via direct tax payments or through resultant inflation... Effectively, we have a direct payment from the government to homeowners.

4) This policy is liable to create runaway demand for housing which outpaces the $25K due to people leveraging that money into a loan. This will in turn create another round of house price increase, and as a result, the property owning class is further enriched.

1ej4fvu,CMV: China peaked in 2019 and it is all downhill from here.,"There are so many crash circles happening in China. One really important thing to remember is that in 1990, almost 95% of the land in China was owned by the provinces. For 35 years now, the provinces have provided almost all social services and infrastructure projects by selling off land to developers. Now that developers are bankrupt and not buying land anymore, the provinces have no real income. They have no system set up to bring in taxes like a normal regional or state gov't can do... and as they do find ways to tax residents directly, that is putting pressure on consumer spending.

The other real death cycle is the number of middle class people who are paying a mortgage for a home that was never finished. You have a huge amount of people being forced to pay a mortgage and rent at the same time. In some cases it is even worse because the people got multiple mortgages thinking they could rent out their other homes. Having to pay double housing costs means people have far less money to spend in the economy on other things. Which leads to deflation.

Deflation is bad, even inflation under 2% is bad, because it means if you are a consumer, there is no reason for you to buy items today, because you know that in a month the item will be the same price or cheaper. This is why the USA and most EU countries have an inflation goal of 2%. It is low enough that it doesn't really hurt anyone, but it is high enough that it encourages consumer purchases. This keeps the economy churning. Deflation is also terrible for businesses, especially retail items like food, because if you buy an item for your store today, it might sit in your store for a month and have a lower price when you can actually sell it. This is crushing for low-margin businesses like supermarkets and retail stores.

This is all terrible, but equally bad is the covert ' decoupling ' by western companies, which have similar effects on the economy, and the current President Xi Jinping is doing all the wrong moves to save the economy. It's now even more censorsious, and even more authoritarian. 

Youth unemployment is nearly 40 percent, and number of desperate homeless people litter in every street. China's economic miracle is over and it'd be lucky if it can even be in Japan's lost decades, because at the rate things are going, it's going to turn into North Korea's lost decade.

1f1xm6c,CMV: All recreational drugs should be legal (including hard drugs),"Marijuana is now legal in many states, including my own (IL). But I personally think that all recreational drugs, including hard drugs, should be legal for adults/people over the age of 21+ (obviously not for kids). I know that a lot of people might think this sounds crazy at first, but hear me out.

There are many reasons why I think they should be legal:
- Making something illegal doesn't stop people from doing it, which the Prohibition taught us.
- It would be safer for drug users because they would know exactly what was in their drugs since it would be regulated, helping prevent accidental overdoses.
- People ultimately have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies, even if it's harmful, which is why drinking, smoking, eating unhealthy/being fat, and being promiscuous is legal.
- It would help stop illegal drug trade because there would be less demand since people could just buy drugs legally. This would help stop the cartel in Mexico.
- The government could tax it like they do with weed/alcohol/cigarettes, which would generate a lot of tax revenue.
- Statistically, most people who try drugs don't actually become addicted to to them (despite what DARE might have told you), including hard drugs like cocaine. There are also high-functioning addicts.
- For people who are addicts, they need help, not jail time. Jail would likely just make the problem worse, and it incriminates struggling people, making recidivism more likely.

They don't seem like sports. 

I heard that Ballroom dance has been petitioning for a long time to be considered an Olympic 'sport' but not been successful and then pivoted to champion Breaking but that competition seemed vague and out of place. Even the staging seemed odd and out of place with MC's trying to hype an Olympic crowd. 

I don't get these 'sports' as sports - they are dancing with atheletic elements. I would argue Dressage, Synchronised swimming shouldn't be part of the Olympics either. I'd rather see Darts or Shuffleboard!  

Now the obvious counterpoint is Gymnastics as there is some performative element but the presentation of these events highlights difficult moves and then grades them against execution. It is presented with judges and there seems to be a process for quantifying clear cut winners and losers and has mutliple judges to iron out subjectivity. The same could be said of diving.

1exu442,CMV: Obesity being treated as a mental health issue is the best course of action,"Obesity, as I currently understand it is mostly a mental health/distress tolerance problem. Think about how snappy you get when you get ""hangry"" that is what someone on a calorie deficit is going to feel like every day (for the most part). Ozempic I would even consider a mental health medication because it essentially removes the ability to experience the negative emotions we experience when our bodies start freaking out about perceived food scarcity (hunger).

One of the best indicators of adulthood obesity is having an ACE (adverse childhood experience) score of over three. The beginning of our current understanding of childhood trauma literally started at weight loss clinics.

With this in mind I present the following.

1.) Psychiatrists and Psychologists should be allowed to prescribe obesity managing medications. 

2.) Obesity should be a valid reason for mental healthcare to be covered by whatever system you get services from, wether the one we have in America (gross) or one run by your countries healthcare service

3.) Obesity should have talk therapy as a primary intervention. 

4.) Obese patients should be taught DBT ( Dialitetcal Behavioral Therapy) skills and management strategies  to increase their ability to deal with the negative emotions that come with being in a calorie deficit

5.) Obesity needs to be reframed to the public, it's not just that someone needs to eat less. It's someone needing to find a way to intake less calories (generally this is the cause of obesity), without the restriction becoming to miserable to be sustained.

 Managing obesity is something that is going to take trial and error and open communication between patient and provider, that happens way more often with a therapist than any other healthcare worker. 

Additionally there are ties to hunger levels and stress levels. Moving to a less taxing and stressful society also needs to happen if we want obesity rates to fall. It's real hard to sustain changes that make you feel bad when your material conditions also make you feel bad.
