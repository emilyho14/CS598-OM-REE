16ek8u3,AITA for telling my daughter that life doesn’t stop for others because hers isn’t going well?,"I have 3 kids, and my daughter (27F) hasn’t had the best luck in her romantic life. She’s gotten cheated on many times, and her previous relationship were unhealthy. I also believe shes in a toxic relationship with her current boyfriend.

My nieces and nephews, along with my other kids are all happily married, some starting their own families. 
 
It was my sisters birthday recently, and she and her husband had planned the trip for the family. She helped with expenses if needed but for the most part everyone payed for themselves.

My daughter was the only one going by herself.

We did things as family, but there were times when we split up to do something with just our partners. So sometimes my daughter was by herself or basically being a third wheel.

At the end of the trip my daughter complained to me how she hated going on the trip. That she felt like it was a cruel joke that she was there by herself, and that the others should not have show affection to their partners when she was around. This is not the first time she complained about something like this, she’s done it after holidays and birthdays as well. 

I’ll admit i’m tired of my daughter complaining about this. So I told her that just because her life isn’t going well doesn’t mean others will stop living theirs. She hasn’t talked to me since, and that was almost two weeks ago. My husband is on my side but i’m worried i’ll lose my daughter.

16qh017,AITA for 'belittling' my sister and saying she shouldn't demand her husband help with their baby at night?,"My husband and I (29M, 27M) went through the surrogacy process and had our son 4 months ago. We were thrilled when my sister (31F)  announced her pregnancy and we found out we would be having children very near the same time. Our niece was born a little over two months after our son.  
  
My situation and my sister's closely mirror each other. Our husbands both work typical 9 to 5s with 30 - 45 minute commutes. My sister is a SAHM and I do freelance work from home.   
  
For the first two weeks after our son was born (the first of which my husband took off of work), we would both take partial night shifts. Once I felt like I had at least some of my bearings on parenthood, I offered to take over completely on week nights, while he does mornings before work + weekends. It's a collaborative process and that breakdown of parenting just made sense to me. My husband was the one leaving our home to work every day, he was the one who had to be up by a specific time and make a drive.  
  
At 4 months, we no longer have this obstacle anymore (and to be honest, I kind of miss the sweet, quiet bonding time those extra night feeds provided now that he's settled onto a nice sleep schedule and usually only wakes up once.) Still, I think we got it down to almost the perfect science before we exited the newborn stage. My sister, on the other hand, is very much still in that phase and struggling.  
  
This has been a recurring problem for her from the beginning. She has been coming to me saying she's scared she's going to fall asleep holding the baby, that her husband won't help her with the night feeds, etc. I tried to give her tips since I've been through it. I suggested she let her partner take over in the evenings (\~6 to 9pm) so she can go to bed early and catch a few more hours, nap when baby naps, etc.. She shot down everything saying ' that wouldn't work for them' and that she just needed her partner to do some of the night feedings.   
  
I reminded her that her husband is the one commuting in the mornings and falling asleep while driving was a very real possibility, and that I had lived through it and so could she. I then offered to watch her daughter for a few days so she could catch up on sleep. She took major offense to both of these things. She said I was belittling her experience and acting like I was a better parent. She said I couldn't truly empathize with her or give her valuable tips since she had been pregnant and I hadn't, and that me offering to watch my niece just felt like me saying she needed help raising her own daughter.  
  
My intentions were definitely not malicious and I'd like some outside perspective here. AITA?

168h2xd,AITA for refusing to share my half of the inheritance money with my niblings?,"My sister (40f) and I (34m) recently lost our last remaining parent. We are both devastated, but regardless, the logistics all need to be worked out. Our parents were very clear in their will that our inheritance and all property are split evenly between the two of us. It’s to the tune of around $1 million. Here’s where the problems start. I’m gay, I live with my partner who I’m not married to across the country from the rest of my family. My sister and her husband have 3 small kids under 11. My sister said that since it’s highly unlikely I’ll ever have kids (which still remains to be seen, I haven’t decided that yet) and because I live a comfortable life currently, that I should take at least a quarter of my inheritance money and open bank accounts for her kids. Instead of using her own money to do that, she wants to buy a McMansion to get out of their smaller cramped house. Basically implying that her and her family need the money more than I do since they’re married with kids and I’m not. She thinks my parents were unfair when they created the will and that I should “do the right thing” to make up for their mistake. Our entire family is split on the issue. My BIL is obviously on my sister’s side and says I’m being greedy and don’t care about my niblings’ future. Our aunts and uncles and cousins all have differing opinions, with the more homophobic side of the family saying I’m being a greedy asshole. This is causing a major rift and I’m worried that eventually she’ll cut me off and wont let me have a relationship with the kids anymore. Part of me thinks maybe I should just let the money go.

16i10qu,AITA for turning around and going back to my parents with my baby when I got home because my husband let his homeless brother move in and everyone had lice.,"I recently went to see my parents with my newborn. It was just for the long weekend so my husband stayed home with our three older children. 7/5/3. 

My husband called me when I was out of town to let me know his brother needed a place to crash. I said that he should give him a ride to a shelter or something because it was a bad idea to let his brother in our home. He has stolen from us before. 

When I got home there were five very itchy people in the house. I immediately got back in my car and went to my parents house. My husband was calling me the whole time because he needed help dealing with the lice. I didn't call him back until the baby was settled back in at my folk's place. 

I told him the pharmacy had the shampoo and comb for lice. He said he needed me to come home and take care of it.  I noped. I said that he let his brother in our home against my wishes. His brother gave them all lice. I also reminded him that when our oldest got lice from kindergarten he didn't help me at all. 

I hate lice. They freak me out. I dealt with it because I had to.  This time it's on him. He said that he would have to use up his sick days to take care of this. I said tough shit. 

He did it. He took his brother to a shelter, he deloused himself and the kids, and then he spent three days cleaning all the bedding and the furniture. He called me every day begging for help. I did not come home until his mothe confirmed that everything was done. 

He is pissed that I stuck him with all that by himself. I know I should have helped but it was too much.  I'm still not 100% from the baby. It was just too much.",Weird_Theme_2795,16422,1311,0.949999988079071,0.6569683908045977,1694644178,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16i10qu/aita_for_turning_around_and_going_back_to_my/,2023,9,AmItheAsshole,2023-09-13 22:29:38
16gboda,AITA for telling my sister gender reveal parties are tacky and attention seeking,"My sister (25f) has always been a bit of an attention seeker. She would always announce her grades, new jobs, raises, etc. whenever the family was together. It killed me when she used to tell the entire family she got a 100 on her test in a class that we were taking together even though she knew I only got a C- or D+ and they would ask me how I did after her announcement. She was always the golden child and I (26f) was the screwup.

We're both pregnant right now, both of our first kids. She's married with a great job and a house and I'm on my own in a studio right now. A couple weeks ago I got an invitation to her gender reveal barbecue/pool party. I didn't want to deal with her showing off to the entire family in front of me so I told her I won't be coming. She asked why so I told her that I didn't want to deal with her friends and our family. She insisted it would be fun so I told her that gender reveal parties are tacky and I don't want to deal with it. 

She, again, insisted that it would be fun and just to think of it as a barbecue with colored cookies. I snapped at her that I didn't want to go to a stupid party to watch her show off to our family just like she did when we were younger. She hung up on me and now our parents are upset at me for being rude to her.

16rb5mt,AITA for insinuating a woman was fat?,"I (35F) am currently 8 months pregnant. Something I've learned (fun news for anyone aspiring to follow down that same path) is that a LOT of people, mostly older women, feel that if you get pregnant they suddenly have the right to both comment and touch your body without permission. Sometimes/often without warning- even total strangers. I'm an intrinsically private person and while I don't take offense, it does encourage the inner snark to come out. 

I started showing around 5/6 months. I have two fibroids that are each quite large, think softball size. This causes me to look bigger and further along than I am. I've also not really gained elsewise (yes I'm aware it's a good problem to have, but I do look disproportionate) so it's REALLY apparent even under hoodies. Fast forward to last weekend.

I was in our local grocery store and an older, larger woman walks up to me and says something akin to ""aw hunny, congrats! How far along are you?"". Kindly, sure, so I smile, step out of touching distance (this is usually when they go for a belly feel) and say ""8 months"". She looked at me with a shocked expression and exclaims ""Oh hun NO I would have guessed any day now! YOU'RE HUGE!!""

So... I smiled sweetly back at her and said ""aw thanks, you too"". 

You can imagine it didn't go over well. At one point she said something about it being medical, and so my one interjection was ""hey me too""- but it didn't do much to diffuse the situation. Eventually she huffed away and I carried on my business.

I don't really feel bad, but I am trying to gauge the assholiness of my response. I strongly feel that there shouldn't be a stigma that pregnant women suddenly become public property, but acknowledge I could have once again been the 'bigger person'. Or responded with ""yeah I have two tumors in there with her"" which has historically gotten a sputtering apology from people too. (Fibroids are benign tumors so this is technically true, just aimed at making people uncomfortable).",Silver-Butterfly-767,9799,2289,0.8999999761581421,0.5724158666465087,1695595268,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rb5mt/aita_for_insinuating_a_woman_was_fat/,2023,9,AmItheAsshole,2023-09-24 22:41:08
16jqw93,AITA for shutting down a girl’s attempt to diagnose me with an eating disorder?,"I lost my left leg when I was very young from a hospital acquired infection. I have a prosthetic leg which I use for walking and another one for running and exercise. When I was on my parents health insurance growing up I got refitted regularly as I grew up. Now I’m too old to be on my parents insurance and while my company’s insurance is considered very good, getting a new leg or getting adjustments for body weight changes are still expensive. I expect to be paying a fortune if I get pregnant. So I try my best to stay the same weight and if I gain some weight I can immediately feel it becoming less comfortable to walk in.


Anyway a friend’s gf and I were talking and she began remarking on how I’m not eating much. We were out to dinner and I just was having a soup and salad and everyone else was having baby back ribs. I’d stolen a few of my bf’s plate but generally I was trying to eat light. I said I was trying to lose a few pounds and she immediately assured me I was beautiful the way I was and I didn’t need to lose weight. I told her I know I am but losing weight helps with my mobility. She began “diagnosing” me with an eating disorder. Saying I must have a delusion I was very heavy and having issues walking. I was pissed and she sounded super condescending and blurted out she had no business talking down to me about my weight even if it was to tell me not to change it. The other people overheard and the gf got really embarrassed and left with my friend soon after. 

With long loose pants it’s often hard to tell I have a prosthetic leg. I don’t know if she knew but I didn’t feel like justifying why my weight needed to stay the same.

When my wife and I met my facial hair admittedly was patchy. But as the years have passed and I have aged my facial hair is now full and supple. I have always wanted to grow a nice long beard like the masculine men I saw growing up. I always admired it. Throughout my relationship with my wife I have normally kept just scruff on my face. But I have also told my wife about my desire to grow out my beard. Her reaction is always to tell me who that's gross or you need to shave you look disgusting.

16wk6vv,AITA for refusing to give up my airplane seat to a tall person?,"Hey everyone! Bit of a weird situation and I’m not sure if I am TA or not. Happy to have my perspective challenged.

Last week I was taking a 12 hour flight that I had booked months in advance. At the time of booking I paid extra to choose my seats. The seat I chose was $55 extra and right at the front of the plane (trying to arrive somewhere on time upon landing). The seat also happened to be an extra legroom seat and I am a 4’11 female.

I check in, board, sit in my seat as usual, but as soon as the seatbelt sign was switched off I had a man come over and ask to change seats. The first time he asked politely saying that he is 6’4 and flying is painful for him can we please change seats. I was open to it until I saw that his seat was way in the back of the plane and so I told him no sorry I paid extra to sit up front. He kind of got increasingly mad and wouldn’t leave saying that there’s no reason someone of my height needs extra legroom (I told him I paid to be upfront). I suggested that he ask the other people in those seats if they could swap but he refused saying that he wouldn’t want to bother other men or split up couples. He kept getting rude and angry so I just called over a flight attendant who told him to go sit down. For the rest of the flight he would walk past for no reason slamming into me (I was sitting aisle).

Was I in the wrong? Should I have swapped with him? TIA",Such-Error-34,5916,1857,0.949999988079071,0.402466177625473,1696113531,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wk6vv/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_my_airplane_seat_to/,2023,9,AmItheAsshole,2023-09-30 22:38:51
169bc2f,AITA for wearing scrubs even though I’m not a nurse,"Five years ago, when I was in high school, I got a job as a kennel technician at a pet store. when I got the job, I was told to go get a few pairs of scrubs, and that I need to wear scrubs to work every day. I helped people out around the store just like all of the other employees, but my main job was to help the vet take care of the puppies. Obviously, the vet did the heavy lifting and I was just there to assist. I don’t know for sure why I was required to wear scrubs when the most medical thing I did was give the dogs their medicine, and I’m pretty sure it was just so the kennel techs looked professional (the owner was a bit pretentious and was always concerned with appearing professional). 

Three years ago when I started college, I had to quit my job at the pet store. I was determined to pay my way through college and not take out any student loans, and as much as I loved that job, it did not pay very well. When I quit, I got rid of all of the shirt scrubs, but I kept the pants because as it turns out, nurses have been holding out on us, and scrubs are really comfortable. I treat them like sweatpants. They are comfortable and just something for me to wear around the house on my day off, but I would never go out in public wearing them.

Fast forward to two days ago, when I went out to go check the mail while wearing some of my old scrubs without thinking about it. Our neighbor who lives in front of the mailboxes was out watering her garden and she perked up when she saw me. She she got all excited and told me about how her daughter was a nurse, and how she knew I was in college but she didn’t know I was going to college to be a nurse. So I of course cut her off and said oh I’m actually in college getting a degree in history and I go on to explain why I had the scrubs and all that. To say she was mad about me wearing scrubs would be an understatement. She compared it to stolen valor, when people dress up like veterans and first responders when they aren’t. She went on and on about how hard her daughter worked to become a nurse, and that nurses “have earned the right to wear scrubs.” I was honestly a little baffled, because I wasn’t trying to pretend to be a nurse, and now, one of my neighbors who I barely know is lecturing me in the middle of our neighborhood. 

She posted on Facebook that afternoon that she saw someone out in public wearing scrubs, and that when she talked to them it turned out they weren’t even a nurse. It was very clear that she was talking about me, but I do appreciate that she said it was a stranger at a grocery store since she is friends with a lot of the people in our neighborhood. I didn’t even consider that I could be in the wrong until I saw how everyone who was commenting on her post was agreeing with her. So am I the asshole?",Capn_Frogger,10027,490,0.9700000286102296,0.3639602642656263,1693782475,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169bc2f/aita_for_wearing_scrubs_even_though_im_not_a_nurse/,2023,9,AmItheAsshole,2023-09-03 23:07:55
16bzzj6,"AITA for refusing to change the color of my sister's bridesmaid dress, even though she hates it?","I can't believe I'm posting about this but I really need some insight.

I (23f) am getting married to my fiancé (25m) in November. We're really excited and the day is fast approaching.

I have 5 women being my bridesmaids, one of them is my sister, Millie (21f). Millie has always been more of a tomboy growing up but doesn't have an issue with wearing dresses for formal events.

I want my bridesmaids to wear matching dresses, which everyone knew when they accepted. I bought and paid for the dresses. They're a relatively simple style and in a pastel pink color.

Millie is now angry and saying she won't wear the dress because it's pink and ""too girly"". She's even threatening to not attend the wedding anymore unless I return her dress and pick out another color.

I'm distraut that she'd make such a problem out of a dress color when she knew I wanted the bridesmaids to match. I think Millie is being dramatic and could deal with wearing the dress for one day but tbh my feelings are really hurt that she'd threaten to drop out of the wedding over this.

My fiancé thinks I should kick her out of the wedding party before she causes bigger problems closer to or on the day. My parents got themselves involved in this and told me to just exchange the dress for the same one in a different color and that we're both acting like children.

Our marriage fell apart when Mia was still in diapers. Sarah was having an affair with my younger brother and she became pregnant with my nephew, Caleb (M20).

Sarah and my brother ended up getting together, although eventually my brother abandoned them and packed his bags and moved to another state when  Caleb was around 2 and to this day never sees his son.

We had shared custody of Jamie and Mia but they gradually chose to spend more and more time at my home when they became teenagers, as they felt that their mom liked Caleb better than them.

Since lockdown, Sarah has changed a lot as a person. She ""rededicated her life to Christ"" and joined a very cult-like online church.

Recently, someone from his college outed Caleb as gay and Sarah has disowned him as her son, and ever so graciously gave him a week to get out of her house (sarcasm of course).

I reached out to Caleb and told him that he is welcome to stay with me for free so that he can finish college, there's no way I could watch a family member become homeless without trying to help them. After some talking things out he moved in, and I had him take Jamie's old bedroom. My kids haven't lived at home in a while now so I have the space, and it's actually quite nice to have Caleb's company.

The problem is that Jamie and Mia are both extremely upset with me for letting Caleb move in, considering their history with him and Sarah showing him favoritism. They say that there are other family members who could've taken him in (my parents offered but they do live in another country) and that I should've asked them beforehand to consider their feelings.

16ixm2q,AITA for not making an effort to increase my child support payments after coming into some money.,"I got divorced five years ago and I lost a lot. My ex got the apartment and out car. I was okay with it because she had our children and I wanted everything to be as stable as possible for them. I ended up moving in with my grandmother to make ends meet. 

My ex and I were doing a decent job of being co-parents I think. I spent a lot of time with my kids and I have never missed a child support payment. 

My grandmother became I'll during COVID and I was basically her caregiver. She made it through but it knocked her on her ass. She passed away about two months ago. 

I am an only child but my parents are both irresponsible which is why they couldn't help me out when I needed somewhere to live. 

My grandmother made me her main beneficiary when she passed away. All that she said was to take care of my kids. 

I sold her house after I gave everyone their bequests. I took the money and the rest of the estate and I bought myself a house and a car. Her house was old and not in a great neighborhood for kids. I also put money into my children's education fund. 

When my ex found out what I did she got upset. She said that I owed her more child support now. I checked with my lawyer before I did anything. Money from an inheritance, the sale a house, or a lottery win does not count as income. If I had invested the money instead then the interest would count as income. 

She thinks I intentionally screwed her over. I think I now have a good reliable car for work and a nice, small house in a good neighborhood for when I have the kids with me.

My parents joked about him being colorblind since my uncle (my dad’s brother) is. He continued this claim, constantly mentioning it to others, which has always annoyed me because I’m sure he’s lying. I’ve told my parents, but they brush me off, saying I’m just jealous of the attention he gets.

Last week was my birthday. I had a gathering at home with about 25-30 people on the weekend. The topic of his supposed colorblindness came up again, with everyone asking him to identify colors. I, feeling frustrated, asked him to take an Ishihara test on the TV. He agreed after some hesitation. I went up to my room to grab my computer to plug to the TV. But instead of a genuine test, I used a fake Ishihara test, one that anyone could pass. He pretended not to see some numbers, and once the test concluded, I revealed to everyone that it was a fake test, aiming to show he was lying.

The mood turned sour. My brother and parents were furious. My family tried to brush it off, making jokes, and my friends found it amusing. Post-party, my parents were livid, they labeled me as an “attention seeker” and a jealous asshole and grounded me for embarrassing my brother.

I feel like had he been honest, he wouldn’t have been humiliated. So, AITA?",Confident_Cookie_241,5607,1013,0.959999978542328,0.2920044267082145,1694559026,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16h5u91/aita_for_using_a_fake_test_to_expose_my/,2023,9,AmItheAsshole,2023-09-12 22:50:26
16qj1fi,AITA for saying that my cats health is more important to me than my 4 year old nephew?,"I promised my sister to look after my 4 year old nephew Alex while she goes out for a dinner. Anyway, I woke up that morning and noticed that my cat cheese wasn’t feeling well. He was refusing to eat or drink and being overall very lethargic, after a few hours of him not getting better, I decided to take him to the emergency vet so I immediately called my sister and told her that cheese isn’t doing well and I was gonna be taking him to the vet and that I’m very sorry but I won’t be able to look after Alex. 

She lost her marbles. She didn’t even ask what’s wrong with cheese, she instantly started blaming me for ruining her night and claiming that it’s prob nothing serious and saying that it ridiculous that I care more about a cat than my nephew… I told her that that wasn’t true but I wasn’t gonna leave cheese to suffer all day till the next morning, after going back and forth I told her that yes I do care about my cats health more than my nephew. My cat was a life of death situation, my sister could’ve called a baby sister or asked someone else to take over but my cat could’ve potentially died. 

I love cheese, it’s just me and him at my apartment so he’s a huge part of my life and not just a pet that can be replaced so I truly don’t think I did anything wrong.

My mum called a few days later and told me that I should apologize for saying I care more about cheese than my nephew but I refuse to do so unless I get an apology about how she talked about my cat.

16a6jls,AITA for telling my wife she can do all the old people stuff but I'm not interested yet.,"My wife is six years older than me. I'm 54. I still enjoy skiing, scuba diving, hiking, etc. My wife used to be my partner in all that stuff. Now she is happy reading, gardening, watching TV, and being a grandma. 

I love being a grandpa. But I like taking my grandchildren out to the pool, or the park. I do play games at home with them as well. 

My wife says that she doesn't want to do the things we used to do any more.  She says she doesn't have the energy any more. I don't mind doing them on my own. For example this last winter she got to stay at the hotel, the chalet, and town while I went skiing. This summer she didn't want to come down to the Carribean to go scuba diving. I would have loved her company but she said she wanted to help with the grandkids more. I said I understood but I still wanted my vacation. So I went. 

When I got back she was upset with me. She said I was an asshole for taking a vacation without her. She could have come. I just wasn't interested in hanging around the city for an extra two weeks. She said that she felt like I abandoned her. I said I worked hard my life so I could enjoy it not to lay like a potato. She said her new hobbies might be sedentary but she enjoyed them. I said that was fine but I didn't want to do old people shit until I absolutely had to.

16kkvpk,AITA for suggesting to cancel my stepkids’ trip to Paris and Kyoto?,"  
My husband has 2 kids from a previous 9f and 7m. The kids have been with my husband 100% of the time since my husband and his ex broke up. She has not been very involved in their lives since the youngest was just a year old. They do not have a relationship with their mom, however, her mother and grandmother do visit the kids, but not often. I’ve known the kids since they were 3 and 5.   


  
I’ve traveled a lot during my childhood and as an adult. It’s something that the kids are really interested in. I go on vacation multiple times a year and unfortunately, my husband and the kids could never travel with me outside the US. The kids need a letter of permission to travel abroad, which was hard for us to get since his ex never answered his emails.  


  
My family and I have been planning a trip to Paris and Kyoto to visit my maternal grandmother and paternal grandparents for Christmas and New Year. My entire family is going on this trip, my parents, in-laws, siblings, cousins, nieces, and nephews. We’ve been planning this trip for over 2 years and we finally bought our plane tickets after my son was born eight weeks ago. My husband’s ex has also signed the letter of permission, so everything is already in order for the trip.   


  
Last weekend my husband’s ex sent him an email regarding our trip. She basically asked if we could cancel our trip, so the kids could spend Christmas with their great-grandmother. Their great-grandmother is supposedly ill and they’re not sure if she’s going to be here next year.  
My husband immediately wanted to reject that idea, but I asked him to think about it.  


  
I think it might be good for the kids to stay behind with their grandma. They’ll get to see their great-grandma for maybe for the last and they’ll also see their mom. I know the kids are very excited to travel abroad, but do think this is more important than Paris or Kyoto. Both are just cities they won’t go anywhere and we can visit in summer. I told my husband all of this and he argued that we’d probably not get the money back we already spend. I told him that we bought business-class plane tickets and I know we’ll get that back.   


  
My husband just got angry and told me that we’re not going to discuss it anymore. My parents and siblings are on his side, but I feel like they’re only looking at the money. When I was a kid my parents also left my siblings and me in Kyoto with my grandparents to go on a trip. At the time I was also angry about it, but as an adult am very happy that I got to spend that time with my grandparents.   


  
I think this is also the case for the kids. They probably won’t be happy about it now, but will really appreciate it when they’re older. My husband disagreed with this and told me I was not looking at the kids’ situation and was angry when I again suggested canceling their trip.

16i1t09,AITA for defending my parents choice to take money for my sisters surgery out of her college fund?,"
I(17f) am a freshman in college, as is my sister Leah(18f). 

Our parents weren’t the best off growing up, but they always set aside money for us to go to college. 

Leah played soccer, and before her freshman year of high school our parents sat her down and told her that if she played, she needed to be careful because if she got hurt all the money to pay for it would come out of her college fund. Several schools in the league our high school is in are pretty good with a reputation for playing rough, and she isn’t the biggest person, so she knew there were risks involved. 

In our sophomore year she had a pretty bad non contact injury that ended up needing surgery and several months of physical therapy. All this money came out of what would be contributed to her fund, and I don’t know an exact number but all the appointments and stuff were at least several thousand. 

Now we’re both going to similarly priced schools, and she will need more loans than I do. In a group chat we’re both in I made a joke about how expensive college is and she responded “now imagine paying thousands more because your parents don’t want to pay for your medical bills”. 

I privately messaged her and told her I didn’t think she should be sharing personal stuff like that and that she knew the risks of soccer and chose to play anyway. She said that she was free to share something that really upset her and that I needed to stick up for her against our parents(she’s argued about this many times). She said that they paid for my medical bills so they should for hers and that I was a “shitty sister” and is asking for me to tell our parents they should’ve paid. I don’t think I should have to, they clearly outlined what they would and wouldn’t pay for and the risks she chose to take aren’t my problem.

16b318x,AITA for not looking after my infant niece while my sister had to run errands?,"I feel really bad and need an unbiased opinion.

I (28f) am currently living with my sister (32f) and my niece who is 5 months old. My sister asked me to move in with her as she was separating from her partner and needed someone to help with the bills. I cover the majority of rent payments for the house and bills since my sister is not fully back to work yet. On the days she is working it is usually our mother who looks after my niece.

Now I mainly work from home and due to how loud both my niece and my sister are and the job specifics I wear good noise cancelling headphones (I also have a room with my own bathroom). I have told my sister multiple times if she needs anything and I haven't responded to a knock she needs to come into my room and tap me to get my attention otherwise I would simply won't hear her and wouldn't know if she needs anything. However my sister keeps forgetting it.

Last Friday was very hectic at my work so I ended up working 12 hours and had some snacks to get me going. I had no knowledge of my sister asking anything of me since I sit opposite the door I also haven't seen her coming into my room since she didn't tap me on my shoulder as we agreed. Apparently she had to run a few errands at work and had noone to leave my niece with and decided to leave her with me since she would be a few hours. Because I had no idea of her plans and she hasn't followed what I have asked her to do, my niece was left unattended for over 3 hours and was crying her eyes out for god knows how long. I only found out about it when my sister returned home (I was still working and had my headphones on) as she ripped the headphones off my head and started shouting at me and calling me an asshole for not attending to my niece, even I have explained to her I had no idea she was gone or my niece was crying (to add, I don't look at my phone during work hours and after I have checked there was no messages or missed calls from my sister)

16h6lbq,AITA for telling my sister it's her own fault our family doesn't help her with her kids?,"I (f21) have a sister Chloe (f32). Chloe has three kids, f8, f6 and m1. She and her husband both work and the youngest goes to daycare. Ever since the youngest has been born, my sister has had a bit of a personality shift. Getting more into organic food and ""holistic living"" as she calls it.

Chloe and her husband started leaving the kids with our parents for the whole weekend, every weekend, so that they can get a break. My parents are doting grandparents and seemed to enjoy it but around a month ago they refused to do it anymore, their reason being that they are too tired to keep up with the kids.

They then started leaving the kids with my other sister Avery (f27) every weekend. This had a similar ending.

After Avery started refusing, Chloe asked me if I could babysit the kids on the weekends. I stupidly told her yes. I only babysat for 3 Saturdays and had to call it quits because Chloe was driving me nuts.

First of all, she has a very very long list of rules for the kids while they're babysat. Some aren't so difficult to follow, like organic foods only (which is only what Chloe has in her house anyway), but others just feel silly, like no holding the baby for 'too long' and no shows or movies from Disney. There are more but this sub has a character limit.

When I was babysitting, Chloe would be calling me every 30 minutes, and she gets angry if I don't answer straight away. Every time Chloe came home, she would berate me over something, anything. Not answering the phone quick enough, letting the baby nap too long, etc.

When I told Chloe I'd no longer babysit, she got upset and said no one ever wants to help her anymore and her village is disappearing. I couldn't really pretend and I told Chloe it's her own fault, and people would be more willing to help her if she wasn't a helicopter parent. She blew up at me and said she's demanding basic respect.",Flaky-East-7161,5747,431,0.9700000286102296,0.2265830932572929,1694560871,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16h6lbq/aita_for_telling_my_sister_its_her_own_fault_our/,2023,9,AmItheAsshole,2023-09-12 23:21:11

(and some other family members),"My(15F) parents divorced when I was 3, my dad quickly remarried after that to my now step-mother, no kids between them, tho my Step-mom (whom I'll call ''Dora'') has a 16 y/o daughter (Sam) who quickly bonded with my dad because her bio dad has never been in the picture, he loves her and treats her as his own, but we're not close and we don't really like each other so anyway. She also lives primarily with my dad while I spend friday night to monday morning at his house and around 3-5 weeks during school break.

Now my paternal family is really outdoorsie, we like to do a bunch of things around that Sam is included and we just ignore each other during them while enjoying our time with others, however, my dad, grandad, aunt and I have a special treasure hunt we do around Christmas that it's really special to me. It's like the only real time I have with my dad because, while Sam is not as bitchy as some I've read here, she really likes to demand both my grandad and dad's attention and since they consider me ''tomboy-ish'' they kinda ignore me to coddle her which sucks.

My dad asked me around my 10th  birthday if he could invite Sam and I said no. I've been saying no ever since and while he doesn't like it, he respects it, he does other stuff with her without me and I don't complain. This year, however, Sam is very adamant on going and I just don't want to, my dad is pressuring me to let her come as well as Dora,  while my aunt and grandma are insisting he just leaves this thing untouched between us but my dad doesn't want to hurt ''his little girl's feelings''.

168g7uk,AITA(23F) for telling my siblings that we have to practice saving food for everyone else.,"My mom passed away 2 months ago, and my fiancé and I quickly became the sole guardian of my 3 youngest siblings(16, 14, and 11). As much as I loved my mom, I know how hard it was growing up under her and how we didn’t have a lot, so when I left for college I did feel guilty leaving my siblings there knowing they wouldn’t have much, but I did so for this very reason, so that I could make enough money to get house that allowed me to house all of them if needed. They understood why I had chosen to go away to college and didn’t resent me for leaving them there, which I’m so grateful for. 

Although i am in the position where my siblings can stay with me for however long they need to, I won’t lie and say things haven’t been hard. Especially financially wise, I mean I went from just caring for myself, my fiancé, and our 2 dogs to caring, clothing, housing, and feeding 3 children who need stability. It was such a shocking flip to my world and I’m just trying my best to do what’s best for my siblings. However one thing 3 teenagers can do is eat. And I fully understand that we grew up in a household where we would have food one week and then be home dry the next two weeks, so we truly never knew when we’d eat a full meal again outside of school. Yet that is not a worry my siblings have had to face here, it takes some saving and budgeting but my fiancé and I have come up with a way where we can spend $1,400 a month to fully stock up the house. I have had small conversations about my siblings needing to be considerate of everyone in the house when it’s regarding food and telling them to just take what makes them full and leave enough for others to be full as well. I understand the resources guarding mindset is very hard to get out of, I really do, but what else can I do? Things got bad when my fiancé and I went grocery shopping at Costco on Thursday, and we usually buy a few snacks for the kids to snack on or take to school. We woke up Friday morning and within less than 24 hours all of the chocolate chip cookies were gone and it came in a pack of like 50. 

I called everyone down and explained to them that I will never restrict access to ANY food from them, however they needed to be 100 percent considerate of everyone else in the house who also needed to have access to the same food and snacks as them. I told them that we were going to start learning about portion control and saving food for others and they all said that they understood and that was sort of the gist of it all. 

The reason I’m asking if I’m TA because I went to my group for other people who have the same situation as me and talked about it, and another group member told me that I was being a terrible person by controlling what they ate, and that I was going to give them an ED. Im absolutely not trying to control their eating habits, I’m  just trying to make sure everyone eats.

16t3981,AITA for asking my MIL to stop telling people I’m English?,"I (29f) recently moved to the US with my girlfriend Emma (27f). We met 3 years ago when she moved to the UK to get a professional qualification that took 2 years, then she worked in the UK for a year before we both moved to the US together. I had never met her parents in person before moving here, but I had met her older sister Jane (29f) and I know that they both had spoken to their parents about me. 

I’m Scottish, have lived there for my whole life, as have my parents, grandparents, great grandparents etc. what I’m saying is my family are on record here since the Scottish census began in 1801, and know my family line goes back several hundred years before that. It doesn’t really come up other than when Americans tell me they’re Scottish, which doesn’t normally bother me. Yet when we were at Emma’s parents’ last weekend for a family gathering members of the extended family kept coming up to me and telling me how happy they were that Emma is back from England and how they thought it was interesting I’m English which was confusing because Emma studied not far from my village in Scotland, and I’m not English. I politely corrected them and they all looked confused but changed the subject. After the 10th person — that’s not an exaggeration— I talked to Emma about it and she was just as confused as I was.

About an hour later and after several more instances I was in the kitchen with Emma when her mum (54f) came storming in and asked what I’d been telling people, I was confused bc I had talked to lots of people about lots of things. Then when she clarified I told her that I’ve been telling them I’m not English bc I’m not, and that Emma studied in Scotland bc she did. She went off saying how England is just what they call the UK and it’s the same. I told her that it’s not the same. She said I was letting politics get in the way. I told her that regardless of politics it’s still not the same bc England and Scotland are 2 separate countries and I want her to stop telling people I’m English, and to say Scottish or British instead. Emma agreed with me and we told her that we know she didn’t mean offence, but it is confusing and a tiny bit offensive. Bizarrely, she then said that she was referring to the continent and accused me of trying to make her seem stupid when I pointed out that would make me European. She talked to neither of us the rest of the night, neither Jane when she agreed with us.

Somehow since then it’s ended up being Emma, Jane and I vs their parents and everyone else since then and I kind of regret saying anything.

16uvx4g,AITA for not wanting to sleep in the same bed as my girlfriend's body pillow?,"I (25m) have a girlfriend (26f) who's autistic. Normally I wouldn't bring this up, but it is relevant to this story. She's pretty high functioning, but the main way her autism effects her is a really strong special interest in one specific fictional character. I've never had an issue with this, and I try to keep up with whatever's going on in the fandom for her and listen to her infodumping about her favorite character on a regular basis. 

About a year ago, my girlfriend got a body pillow of her favorite character. I didn't really have an issue with it, as we have a very large bed with more than enough room for something like a body pillow. The body pillow wasn't even that weird as far as body pillows go, it's just her favorite character wearing her normal outfit on one side and a simple dress on the other. Definitely not weird compared to other kinds of body pillows out there. 

Recently, my girlfriend told me she's getting more covers and another pillow inner so she can have two body pillows to sleep with at once. I was more apprehensive about this, as our bed is big, but two five feet long pillows plus two people feels like it would be pushing it. She assured me that if it was really an issue, she could go back to only sleeping with one, or alternatively lay one of them Lincoln style and use it as a regular pillow, so I agreed to it once again. 

The real issue arouse when the pillow covers actually arrived yesterday. She did get another cover of her favorite character, as I'd expected, but what I hadn't was that she'd also gotten a cover featuring her favorite character's DAD. I'd always known she had a little crush on him but I never thought it would go THAT far. Worse, this pillow isn't just him in a normal outfit like her original one. One of the sides full on has his dick and balls out for the world to see. 

I told my girlfriend that I'm putting my foot down, and I refuse to sleep in a bed with another man, even if that man is a pillow. She said that that's ridiculous, it's not like he's real, and one of the sides is SFW so if I'm really uncomfortable she can just keep it flipped to that side. 

I said that I still don't feel comfortable with that. I know I wouldn't be able to forget the uncomfortably detailed dick lying in wait on the other side of the pillow, especially if I have to sleep right next to it. She said she can put the pillow with her favorite character (who's female) between us, and keep the dad pillow firmly on her side of the bed, but I said I just don't want him in my bed at all. 

She's pretty pissed about it. Her body pillows are pretty expensive, since she has to get the art custom drawn and then custom printed, and it's not something you can return. The dad character really doesn't have any superfans other than her, so it's not like there's some other girl she can possibly try to sell him to either. I know she's been saving for this pillow a long time, so I do feel guilty saying she can't cuddle with it. AITA?

16eks1y,AITA My husband treats my kids horribly compared to his own.,"Some context here, We’re both 44. When we met he was a single father who had sole custody of two kids. The mother hadn’t been in the picture in years, big time drug user and lost all her kids. I was a single mother with three kids. One of the things (There were many things but this really got me as my kids are the most import thing in my life) that I found appealing was that he was legally raising and loving another man’s child as his own! The first few years together were great, some minor disagreements with parenting, like him calling my 3 and 4yr olds sissies because they needed a night light to sleep. 

Blending families always has learning curves I thought, best to discuss with him and we can iron out a mutual parenting plan. It seemed to work for a few years.

We had all been living as one family for about five years. He proposed, 3 months after our wedding things started to change. Little things at first, comments that weren’t mean just mostly sarcastic Then it turned into yelling if a chore wasn’t done to his exact standards.

Each kid had 1 chore a day. I was not okay with this yelling and bickering that occurred daily, once again we talked but he wasn’t receptive and got very defensive  “You let the kids get away with everything and they have no consequences.” I’m a firm believer in not double punishing kids. So if a chore wasn’t done correctly I would tell to remember next time that this is also part of your chore. For example if one was taking the trash out but didn’t put a new trash bag in the trash can, it’s not defiance it’s a typical kid’s forgetfulness. To clarify all five of the kids had this issue. 

He started harping on the kids more and his kids point blank refused to do their chore. This went on for 2weeks, he didn’t say anything. So I brought it up and his response blew me away. He said “Your kids can do my kid’s chores for awhile seeing as how yours don’t know how to do chores correctly and mykids need a break”  

After that, It was he was yelling at my three for everything and it said it my kid’s fault that his didn’t do their chores. We both worked 40 hours a week, I handled the bulk of the household chores with the kids having small tasks like trash, putting the dishes away, folding clothes, sweeping, feeding the dogs and I rotated the chores every week so each kid didn’t get stuck with the same chore. 

Tired of only me and my kids cleaning up the house we all lived in, I decided to give those that did their chores a reward of extra screen time. His kids-still not doing chores- complained about not getting the extra screen time. He bought his kids each a tablet after denying my kid a tablet for her 12th bday. I put parenting software on the tablets and only allowed them time if their chores were done. He said I was an asshole and I had no right to stop them using what he bought them. Is he right and I’m the asshole?",EnvironmentalRoll317,2814,868,0.9399999976158142,0.1896049524257479,1694303227,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16eks1y/aita_my_husband_treats_my_kids_horribly_compared/,2023,9,AmItheAsshole,2023-09-09 23:47:07
16byu49,AITA for taking money out of my son’s allowance?,"
I(41F) have 3 sons(twins who are 12, and a 10 year old). All of my sons started doing chores around 8 and started getting allowances for their chores at 10 years old. Chores are only mandatory 5 days out of the week, I don’t care what time a day they choose to get them done. As long as they are done by the end of the day. I made it clear to my boys once they started earning money that they would be getting 10 dollars a day for everyday they complete their chore. If they fail to do so, then 10 dollars would be deducted. It has been that way for 2 years for my eldest boys and a couple of months for youngest. Allowance is always paid out every Wednesday, and I encourage them to save enough to take with them on the weekend to their dads in case they go somewhere fun or see something cool that they might want but dad might not be okay with spending money on. This system has worked swimmingly for us since it started, the boys have always complied with completing their chores.

However, one of my 12 year olds refused to do his chore of the week (sweeping down stairs and wiping down surfaces) for 3 days. The first 2 days he did so without problem, but when his friend asked him to play on Fortnite with him, my son asked for 15 minutes to complete his chore before he got onto the PlayStation. His friend asked what chore he had to do, so my son told him. In response, my son’s friend said “it’s a good thing my parents don’t make me do girl chores.” I spoke with my son and explained to him that knowing how to clean was not specific to any gender, that it was a life skill everyone needed to know. I also told him that I understood that other family’s functioned differently; however, in our family, everyone did an equal share. Even after speaking with him the first day he decided to not do his chore, he still chose not to do his chores, so like agreed I took 10 dollars out of his allowance for each day he didn’t do, which allotted to him only having 20 dollars in his allowance; whereas his brothers had 50. 

The problem comes where my son was so upset about the lack of money in his allowance that he called his dad about it very upset. My ex husband then proceeded to call me and tell me that I’m in the wrong for only giving him $20 and to imagine how it makes him feel that his brothers got more than he did. I explained to him that our other sons actually did their chores for all 5 days, so they were rewarded accordingly. And assured him that if he had decided to start giving the boys an allowance then he can run allowance however he wanted, but this was ultimately the system I had come up with. My ex husband told me that I am being insensitive and humiliating our son.

The mom said turn the lights off and tell them to go nighty night. my fiancé responded to the message saying we thought you would be back at 10. What’s the ETA? My sister responded asking if I was irate to which my fiancé said we both have an early morning in the morning. When the two moms got home They were very not remorseful for being two hours late and then not apologize or say anything about the fact there are two hours late. i went to the kitchen to grab my keys, one Mom asked if the kids went down all right I replied Yep and walked outside. my sister texted me apologizing, and I said we both  (me and my fiancé ) felt very disappointed and taken advantage of. I then said you can Venmo us. My sister, said wow, really.
I tried calling my sister to talk about it and explain how upset I felt and hear her out as to why she was upset. My sister has ignored my calls since yesterday and has gotten my mom in the middle of it telling my mom I stormed off and was rude to her friend.

16csnas,AITA for yelling at my husband for asking the temperature of the soup,"My husband and I just got back from a trip where I contracted a nasty bacterial infection in my chest and my sinuses. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that sick before, I’m still sick but no longer feel like I’m dying. Yesterday in the morning I made my famous Get Better Soon Soup that I only make when someone in the family or friends circle is sick. Chopping and slicing and general cooking stuff wiped me the F out, but it was so worth it. Husband was at work and I wanted soup, no big deal. We often bring his mom food since she lives nearby and we like to help/spend time with her. When my husband came home to me laying on the couch much like a dead fish lays on the beach, he declared the soup smelled amazing and then asked me to put some in to go containers for him and his mom to eat. I just looked at him and very slowly and very quietly said, “I’m still really sick, and I’m the one who had to make the soup, it really took a lot out of me, can you Please do it yourself.” I did not succeed in keeping the annoyance out of my voice. He said yes, also a little annoyed. And as he approached the stove he asked “do you think it’s hot enough for us to eat right away, or will I have to heat it up when I get there?”. And then I lost it. I yelled, I couldn’t help myself, I was so annoyed and shocked at his first question, I really couldn’t handle how incredibly incompetent this new question was. I said “Give me a break, please lord you have to be kidding me. You are a grown man, with hands, and a brain. You cannot be asking me about the temperature of something you’re standing over. Tell me you’re fucking with me.” He was standing there shocked and a little hurt, I felt bad, but not that bad! All he had to do was ladle the soup into the to go containers, he’d be able to feel the heat through the container. Or he could have tried it. Or he could have done literally anything other than ask me that question. Stick your wingwang in there for all I care! He really didn’t say much, just packed up the soups, and left. Everything is fine, he seems to have chalked it up to ‘she’s sick and in a bad mood’ and has forgotten about it. I did not apologize, nor has he asked nor seemed like he needed one. Everything’s all good but I told my mom this story and she said I was a jerk and should apologize.

He could’ve used the guest bathroom to shower so even though my comment wasn’t nice… I think it was somewhat justified as he knew I didn’t want to shower together.

16lem3c,AITA for making my daughter share a room with her son?,"I am father of 5 biological children and 1 adopted nephew. My 3 oldest children are adults in their 20's and have previously moved out. My youngest 2 are teenagers aged 16 and 14, and my nephew is 8. My in-laws also live with us. We have a 6-bedroom house so each of the kids have a bedroom, my wife and I have a bedroom, my in-laws have a bedroom, and we previously had a spare bedroom for my older children to stay in when they visit.

My oldest daughter moved to my home country at 18 to attend university there. She met and later married her husband, and they have an almost 4-year-old son together. Things went south in their relationship a few months ago. My daughter moved out with their son, and she was able to stay with my brother for the last few months. 

A couple weeks ago she was able to leave the country to move back home with us. My 16-year-old daughter moved into the spare bedroom so we could turn her bedroom (that is bigger and has its own bathroom) into a room for my daughter and grandson to share. 

The whole family pitched in to decorate to my daughter's taste and to create a nice area for her son with a small loft bed. 

When she came, she was initially grateful, but she did express not being too fond of sharing a room with her son. 

Last week she suggested that my nephew and grandson could share a room instead. I told her if she was staying in my home it would have to be in a shared room with her son. She mentioned it a few more times so I asked my nephew if he would like to share his room.

16jsx4z,AITA for telling my sister her daughter's eating habits are out of control and need addressing?,"I am 30F. I'm raising my two kids, 7F and 4M. I have a younger sister, Megan, 28F. Megan has a daughter, Ava, 5F.

My daughter Ruby turned 7 last week and she wanted a laser tag party. I planned her a birthday party at our nearest laser tag centre, and I allowed Ruby to invite two friends from school. It includes a few games of laser tag and a pizza dinner afterwards for the kids.

Both of Ruby's friends are vegetarians but luckily the laser tag place has plain cheese pizza that they can have.

I invited a few family members as well, including Megan and her daughter. Megan declined, her reasoning being that Ava will not eat pizza and she'll feel left out.

For context

Ava has been a picky eater for a while. Whether this is due to neurodivergence or not, my guess is as good as anyone's because my sister has never taken her to a pediatrician about this (we live in a country with free healthcare, cost is not the issue). Megan just caves and plays restaurant with her all the time and never has her try anything new.

According to Megan, the only things Ava will eat are chicken nuggets, plain cheese sandwiches, mashed potatoes and waffles. Megan just acts like this is not unusual or a problem at all, and says Ava will grow out of it eventually.

The problem started because Megan suggested that we change plans and after the laser tag games, we take all the kids to McDonald's. I told Megan about two of the kids at the party being vegetarians and that she's more than welcome to bring her own food to the party for Ava.

Megan kept trying to persuade me and said Ruby's friends can bring their own food instead. I told her to stop because I'm not changing the plans, she can either come or not, at this point I was getting annoyed. Megan snapped at me and said the girls are choosing to be vegetarians, her daughter isn't choosing to be a picky eater, and I should prioritise my niece. I said it's not about priorities, I'm just not changing plans that are already made and booked. I told Megan she needs to address her daughter's eating habits because they are blatantly out of control.

My sister said there was no need for me to be rude and that I have no right to comment on her parenting, Ava isn't my child and I have no say. She said if I have a problem with that, I can go screw myself.

Megan ended up not going to the party and my parents are intervening and saying that they understand why I said what I said, but it's still not my business and I should've just left it at ""I'm not changing the plans"" and I should apologize to Megan for the comment.

I (23F) have a sister ""Janine"" (26F). Janine is married to her husband (41M) and they have an 18-month-old son together

Since I was a teenager I've always been a private person. I don't do social media, at work I don't talk about my personal life and I only talk about work-related stuff. When I'm with family I don't discuss my work life. 

Because I'm a private person my family has no idea what I do for work, what my salary is and they also have no idea what university I went to or what degree I picked. 

I'm just going to give a tiny bit of context of my family life. When I was 15/16 my mother, a single parent, started getting sick and I became her carer. By the time I was 17, she couldn't do anything other than stay in bed. By the time I was 18, my mother had passed away. I'm not going to lie it was a struggle because I was doing my GCSEs and A-levels and managed to just pass them. I explained my extenuating circumstances to my five choices of universities and all five accepted me. 

Since my nephew was born my sister has become obsessed with taking pictures of her son every single day and is constantly sending them to me. I don't have any insecurities about my body but I just like leading a private life and I haven't taken a picture in five years. 

Every time I come around to see my sister, BIL and nephew, my sister is constantly trying to take pictures of us together and has only managed to successfully take two. Whenever my sister has her phone in her hand or is near her phone I will step away from my nephew as I know she wants to take a picture.

Something came up yesterday and I asked her if she could take Liam and I'd be like 20 minutes late. She could leave or wait in the waiting room when I arrived. She said okay. 

When I arrived, neither my son nor my ex was there. I asked the front desk if they ever came and she looked confused. She said Liam came in with his dad and they were waiting for the doctor. I said, well I'm the dad. I asked if she meant my son's stepdad Chris. She said that makes sense and explained a lot (they look nothing alike).

They told me to go to exam room 5 and the doctor was having my son do some squating thing and sure enough, there was Chris. 

I whispered to Chris thanks for dropping Liam off and then there was there super cringe awkward moment when the doctor asked my son to pull down his underwear in front of us. My son's drawstring wouldn't untie and Chris instinctively tried to untie it but couldn't. So he just pulled his pants and my son almost fell down and Chris looked at me and shrugged and joked ""well it's not anything I haven't seen. I've been his stepdad for awhile.

I told my son that's not how physicals usually work out and I'm sorry I was late. He didn't say anything which is unlike him. He did ask to stay at my house (he is with his mom Monday through Wednesday and me the rest of the week).

I told him I'd ask his mom. I did call her and she wanted to know why. I said he's had a rough day. Leave it at that. And you should had told me you weren't going to make this appointment instead of Chris. She asked if something happened with Chris and I said no something happened with you not communicating with me. It mattered.

Chris texted me this morning and said he wanted to take Liam and the rest of the kids out for ice cream after school. I knew he was trying to make up for what happened.

16wlt8a,AITA for telling my son he either has to sell his car or move out.,"My son is 24 and he has a Charger that my dad left him when he passed away. It is a beautiful car and I wish my dad had left it to me but that isn't the point. My son and him loved working on it together. That's why my son got it. 

In the last year he has also gotten four speeding tickets and just capped it off with an impaired charge. 

It is too much car for him and he is irresponsible. I told him that he either had to move out of my house, where he pays for basically nothing, or sell the car. 

He says that it's all he has from his grandfather, not true his grandparents laid for his education. He says that he was just a little over the limit and that it is a first offense and that I'm being unreasonable. 

I want him to grow up and realize he could hurt himself or others.

I made sure to tell him that our kid was looking to move out and that he was welcome to take him in.",No-Plum1998,1174,521,0.8999999761581421,0.0981250008749126,1696117644,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wlt8a/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_either_has_to_sell_his/,2023,9,AmItheAsshole,2023-09-30 23:47:24
16b3mrb,AITA for ruining a wedding by not telling my friend I was on medication?,"My friend Sarah was getting married, and I was lucky enough to be in the wedding party (not MoH, but bridesmaid). She had an outdoor wedding that had limited bathroom availability. Obviously because it was outdoors, she rented four of those, not a porta potty like you would see at idk a construction site, but a nicer portable one that's longer that they might setup for more sophisticated outdoor events like tennis or polo. Two for women, two for men, four total. The wedding in total was about 150-200 ppl.   
  
I should also mention that due to some health problems, I started taking a medicine that has possible side effects as diarrhea. When you look up medicines which have a million side effects, you tend to just take that and say, well they have to say it has all that, I still need to take the medication. I didn't think to mention this to anyone for a number of reasons 1. As I just side, medicine side effects vary depending on what it is, and commercials and scripts usually overstate them. 2. What am I going to say to her before the wedding, that I'm taking his medication and it might have side effects in general? I've never struggled with incontinence or IBS or anything like that in the past.  
  
It's a little while before the ceremony is about to start, and I'm being pulled into a million directions helping out, and I start to feel a bit of a stomach ache, and then we all get shuffled up to the front without warning. Whatever, I'm at the wedding, I can't go run out for tums, it will be fine. Pachelbel starts playing, everything is in place. 

  
All of a sudden, I feel a deep pain in my bowels. For twenty seconds I'm just standing there thinking, do I have to go, what do I do, just, idk, trying to process the situation while remaining composed. It happens. I'm not going to go into detail here because it was embarrassing and traumatizing, needless to say I excused myself. 

  
After dealing with the whole situation, I was there standing outside the bathroom not sure what to do next. I had assumed the ceremony had continued to go on, do I go back? There's no way. They're in the middle of their vows, and here comes shit girl. So I waited a while as to not interrupt anything.  
  
Two of the other bridesmaids found me crying eventually and told me that Sarah was upset and said I should leave, so I did, in shame. It all happened over the weekend, and its now Tuesday night. I had sent an apology text to Sarah, but I haven't heard anything from her or anyone else in the wedding party. Am I the asshole for ruining the wedding and not letting my friend know about my medication?  
AITA?  
  
TLDR: Had an accident at a wedding in the wedding party, was told to leave, and did. Now my friends wont talk to me. Should I have said something beforehand about the meds I was taking? That's the only way I see having prevented this.

16s5q4a,AITA for lying to my son about the reason our cat wasn't there anymore?,"I (52F) have a son who I will call Asher (18M), and a couple years ago we had a cat named Luna who was our family's pet for 19 years. Around 2 years ago, my husband passed away in his sleep from a heart attack related to complications from his Diabetes.  
  
After my husband's death, Asher went off the rails. Accused me of trying to get rid of my husband. Accused me of cheating. Accusing me of wanting to get rid of our cat. Even threatened to get rid of my late mother's ashes. He ended up having to get hospitalized where the doctors told me he had schizophrenia, and I was advised to rehome our cat by several family members. So I contacted a close family friend and asked her if she was willing to take in the cat, which she took in the cat while my son was in the hospital.  
  
When my son got home, I told him that Luna had gotten very sick and stopped eating while he was gone, and the vet decided she had to be put down. It took him a while, but eventually he accepted it as the truth and mourned the loss of his cat. I felt so bad lying to him like that, but I was worried if he knew the cat was still around, he would have a worse outcome.  
  
Recently, while at a family dinner, one of my nieces told him that Luna was still alive and told him where she was at. Asher ended up confirming that what happened was the truth, and went off on me. Yelled at me for lying to me, for daring to get rid of Luna. I told him I didn't feel like she was safe here and that multiple family members advised me to rehome her. He wasn't having it, and has since stayed shut in his room for a week. He only begrudgingly comes out for dinner, where he yells at me and calls me a terrible mother, and drags his food back to his room.  
  
Am I wrong here? Did I do something bad by not being honest to him? Was I wrong for getting rid of Luna? These questions keep me awake for hours on end sometimes, and now more than ever do these questions haunt my mind.",Few_Temperature_7624,1706,361,0.9200000166893004,0.0951656962135178,1695680061,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16s5q4a/aita_for_lying_to_my_son_about_the_reason_our_cat/,2023,9,AmItheAsshole,2023-09-25 22:14:21
16i1g5p,AITA for taking my son away from my husband?,"I (38F) am married to my husband, Mark (40M). My husband is christian and I'm atheist. Earlier before our marriage, our relationship was tough because his family didn't approve of me being atheist and wanted me to convert to Christianity but I refused. Eventually they came to respect my decision and though I'm not best friends with them, we maintain civility.

When me and Mark had our son, Jay (9M) his family sprung into the picture wanting to baptize him because he was a ""Christian"" baby. I respectfully declined and this caused a lot of tension between me and the family. I made it clear that my son was not to be indoctrinated and that he'll find his way to Christianity if he wants to. Me and Mark agreed on this even though his family didn't like it. 

Just yesterday, we were going to sleep and I went to check on Jay and to my surprise, I find him kneeling and praying. I thought it was cute and watched him until he noticed me. What really shocked me was him instantly stopping, looking freaked out. He then started apologizing and asking that I don't punish him. I was so confused and asked why I would do that, only to find out from him that my husband has been secretly indoctrinating him into Christianity, which happened during times I was not around or when they went to my in laws. Mark told him to keep all this between themselves because ""I've been affected by an unholy spirit, which would make me severely punish him if I found out he was christian"".

I felt sick after hearing about all this and I told him to keep this conversation between us and that he can pray any time he wants to. I ended up sleeping in his room, disgusted with the thought of being next to Mark. Today after Jay went to school, I confronted Mark about all of this and at first he tried spinning this as if Jay was the one who wanted to be christian but eventually admitted it, justifying it with that his family pressurized him and that it's the ""correct"" way to live. I ended the conversation and we both went to work. After work, I took Jay and packed some of our stuff then headed to my father's house before Mark came back. I plan on staying there until me, Mark and his family have a long overdue conversation and to determine whether this marriage is still worth it. I really can't believe any of this is happening. I feel stupid for not seeing this would happen eventually. However my decision feels rash and that I shouldn't keep Jay away from his father because he has no idea what's going on.

16i1uhe,AITA Husband's side of the family is pressuring us to give them a Greencard,"My husband's family is Ukrainian living in Russiaand Italy at the moment

We have invited his dad to visit us in Washington, and while during the week that he stayed with us he managed to throw a huge temper tantrum because he demanded that we apply for a Greencard for him right away. We agreed, but told him we needed to find out more about the process and how he will support his family of 5. He has 3 young kids 17, 13, 11.  He was not satisfied with that and yelled at us about how we are betraying the family and not moving him to the US.

He is a wealthy business owner in Belarus and Russia, and when we asked for him to bring the family for a vacation to the states, he refused. My only condition was to meet the family and talk about moving to the US and all the financial decision involved. He has refused to come and visit us. 

He is now living part time in Italy and part time in Russia and constantly berates my husband and I about how we are betraying him. This is causing me so much stress and anger that I can't sleep for nights at a time.

167n3n4,AITA for telling my wife that I didn't care about her feelings?,"sockpuppet account for obvious reasons.

my wife and I are in our mid-30s. We've been together since 2014, married since 2019. No kids. 

about ~4 times per year, my wife has what I can only describe as a rage attack. She has an (untreated) disorder that causes her emotional regulation issues, and she sees a therapist (though not a psychiatrist). They are very frustrating to me. She is functionally ""unreachable"" as she goes through them, and she just... gets mad. At me, obviously, but just everything in her life, no matter if it makes sense or not. It's like her amygdala just freaks the fuck out at a tiny thing (mild conflicting opinion from me, or not being able to find her phone, etc) and pumps out anger hormones. 

she returns to a baseline afterwards, apologizes earnestly and honestly, and returns to her normal self. Her normal self has big emotions too, but I almost enjoy them - I don't feel emotions as deeply as her, so it's nice to feel along with her, if that makes sense. 

three nights ago, she had one. We had a little disagreement, so I went into the kitchen, and she threw something at the wall and started just *yelling*. She wouldn't let me leave the kitchen. Again there is no reasoning with her when this happens, words mean nothing. 

I escaped, told her to go to bed, cleaned up the mess she made, and that was ""that"".

The next day, she came home from work and started apologizing, and I told her that I wasn't really willing for this to happen again, and she has to take action to prevent this from happening. We kept talking and a couple minutes later she said, ""I feel really bad, you know"" and my response was **""right now, I don't care how you feel. I'm telling you this can't keep going on.""**
we dropped it and moved on.

a couple hours ago, she brought up that it was hurtful that I told her I didn't care about her feelings, but I think that's a pretty reasonable way to respond when I was on the floor of our condo cleaning up her rage choices the night before.

16ix6hb,AITA Older woman is trying to “mother” my bf and ice me out. I think she’s overbearing and I need some boundaries.,"TL/DR: My (25F) boyfriend (25M) has a family friend (50sF) who sleeps in his bed, walks around in her bra, and watches us cuddle. His mother just passed. Now 50sF says she considers herself his “mother” and is trying to ice me out. AITA?

We’ve been dating for 1y +. Three months in, his mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He had to move home several states away. I moved out (at his request) for 3 months (got my own place). His mom and I got along amazingly, she even left family jewelry to me in her will. 

He’d told me about his friend (25F) who’d had a crush on him in high school- fine. He also told me that he’d stayed at her apartment for a night when he’d gotten there- also fine. But things got weird when I met her mom…

We went over to hers for dinner, and she and her mom only talked about how close he was to them. They told me that when he’d gone over to 25F’s house, he’d stripped down to his undies so she could do his laundry, and that she did his hair. (He’d never mentioned this.) They have a special nickname for him and tease me for not using it. The daughter even went upstairs to change into the same outfit I was wearing. 

The mom was even more possessive. For months now, she’s iced me out over and over…I didn’t hear from him for 2 days and later found out she’d taken him on a trip to NY. When he moved back, the mom flew in to help and asked him to stay in her hotel room for the night. (He could have stayed at mine.) 

I asked “one bed or two?” He said my suggestion was gross, she’s like a mom to him. 

She keeps crossing boundaries- she takes sips of his drink at dinner. When I take a bite of his food, she immediately asks him to “make her a bite.” This summer, they insisted that they all take a vacation together- I wasn’t invited.

A few days ago his mother passed. He decided to stay in his condo alone for the night. 50sF flew in at 1 AM and went straight to his condo. There’s no couch and it’s a 1 bedroom. She slept in his bed for two days. 

I was shocked but I didn’t say anything, this is NOT the time- he can barely talk and is processing his grief. But I was so appalled and insulted. She also told me not to come over to check on him. She even asked me to drive her around and run errands for her. I ignored that and went over. 

Every time I tried to get close to him, cuddle in his bed, sit next to him, she took my place or made him move. Then she got ice cream on her shirt, and she took it off in the living room(!) As I was laying next to him, she hovered over us.

His uncle and grandparents seem to have an issue with her too. He told me that she and his family were “fighting over him.” 

He never stops her from crossing the line. He needs to solve that, or I need to eventually walk away because I can’t feel like an intruder in my own partnership forever. WIBTA to ask for some boundaries here? Or am I being jealous and controlling?

Edit - *UPDATE*

I called him this morning, I haven’t heard anything in three days. He was asleep (whoops 😬). He said he would be driving back with her either today or tomorrow. He’s taking the family dog, and it’s a 14 hour drive. I asked him to let me know when he’s coming and keep me in the loop. 

My current plan is to show up when they get in, regardless of the time, and tell her she needs to get a hotel or she can even sleep on my couch (ughhhh but they might get in at a weird hour where she can’t check in, preferable over sharing his bed). She is not sleeping there. I feel sick to my stomach and am trying to do calming breathing but I can’t imagine letting another night in a shared bed go by. 

That’s all I’ve got for now! I’ll update what happens when they get here, lemme know your thoughts on the current plan!

EDIT *UPDATE 2*

So he texted me saying he was in the car headed back, and I couldn’t stop myself. I said something, and I’ll provide exact quotes from the texts below, the links to see the screenshots can be found on Imgur [HERE](https://imgur.io/a/1n9B0iN) as well if you want to see it that way. 

—-

ME: 
Have a safe drive, but I need to be upfront with this: where is (the friend) staying tonight? I think she needs to get a hotel room. 

HIM: 
I don't care to be honest. She's like a parent to me so its never made me uncomfortable. I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable I don't have my couch yet otherwise I would sleep there. 

But I'm not going to make her get a hotel when she's like family to me 

I need you to be ok with this right now please. I can't handle more questioning about my decisions than my family has already done every single day for the past week.  So please just say you are ok right now. We can talk about this a different time if you want to but I'm barely keeping my shit together

—— 

So I just…wow. I was speechless. I know he’s struggling hard but I couldn’t believe he would blatantly say her staying over was more important to him than my clear discomfort. I do want to have an in person discussion about this with him, for those who would say leave now (I hear you, but it’s hard to do a 180 in a day!)",derpypets_bethebest,1134,466,0.9399999976158142,0.0903218733770369,1694733478,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ix6hb/aita_older_woman_is_trying_to_mother_my_bf_and/,2023,9,AmItheAsshole,2023-09-14 23:17:58
16vqlbg,AITA for taking my teen daughter side over my girlfriend,"I'm a 48-year-old man, separated from my 40-year-old wife for the past eight months. We were together for 18 years and have four daughters aged 17, 14, 5, and 4. Despite our separation, my wife and I remain on amicable terms. She resides in our marital home, while I'm currently living in our rental property.  
  
Approximately four months ago, I rekindled a relationship with a former college girlfriend who's 47. We were together for five years back in the day, but parted ways because she wasn’t ready to settle and have kids. She now has a 13-year-old daughter.  
  
A notable issue has arisen between my eldest daughter, who's turning 18 soon, and my girlfriend. My daughter is assertive, outspoken, and holds strong to her principles. She's very bonded with her mother. On the other hand, my girlfriend is quite strict with her own child. She sets clear boundaries, including computer usage limits, basic phones, no TV during school days, and has various disciplinary measures. In contrast, my wife and I have been much more relaxed parents. Our kids have more freedom with their devices, social activities, and we're more lenient when it comes to discipline.  
  
Last night, a situation escalated. My daughters, girlfriend, and her child gathered at my place after school. The plan was for the kids to finish homework, have dinner, and then for us to have a family game night. However, my oldest was engrossed in Instagram and YouTube, which led my girlfriend’s daughter to request similar screen time.   
  
When my girlfriend suggested my eldest put away her laptop to join the game, my daughter declined. My girlfriend insisted, emphasizing the importance of family time. My daughter firmly reiterated her decision to abstain. As I entered the scene, my girlfriend, in front of everyone, said I should intervene. My daughter, clearly frustrated, asserted that my girlfriend isn't her mother and left the room.  
  
I communicated to my girlfriend that while my daughter’s tone could've been better, I’ve never imposed strict family time, and she was preoccupied. Upset, my girlfriend promptly left with her daughter. She later texted me, expressing her belief that I'm permitting my daughter's purported disrespect and criticized our parenting approach.

16vqp7v,AITA for making a Tiktok that somewhat exposed my influencer parents?,"I'm (16m) banished to my aunt's house right now and while she agrees with me that I'm not an asshole for having these feelings, she says she agrees with my parents that i was an asshole for the TikTok that I made about our real lives. Without saying too much, my parents had me while they were in college and i lived with my grandparents until they graduated and got married. I have three younger siblings and we all live in a large city together. My dad has a real job and my mom basically just writes a blog and has social media accounts. She NEVER mentions me. I'm never in pictures. My siblings are because they were written about from the time my mom was pregnant with them, after they got married. She writes a lot about our ""lifestyle"" and brags about how thrifty she is and simple but she doesn't tell people that my grandparents give us money and that she blows it on really expensive things like buckets and sweaters. Trust me when I say that NONE of what you see online about my family is true except for where we live and our names. Anyway, I vented a little bit to my friend about how my parents go back and forth on pretending to be poor but then not and then back again, depending on who they talk to. And i said that sometimes that meant that my mom buys something expensive and stupid to brag about but then I have to hear about eating less or being ""more simple"" about birthday wishlists because life is too expensive. So we made a Tiktok at my house. I pointed out stuff like ""here's my mom's ONE sweater that cost $400 and that's why i got this for Christmas"" and pointed to a kid's art set. I pointed out some stuff that she told her readers she was gifted that she actually bought, too. My Tiktok doesn't get much attention at all but one of my friend's showed it to her mom and her mom showed my mom. My parents are mad and say that doing stuff like this hurts the whole family because it could affect sponsorships and maybe book deals and Dad said i was an asshole for doing the video. So, am I?

177c2tj,AITA for refusing to let my wife name our kid something stupid?,"Me (25m) and my wife (23f) are having our first child together. She is currently 9 months pregnant and could give birth anytime in the next couple of weeks. The only major fight we have had throughout her pregnancy happened a couple days ago, and it was about what we were going to name our kid.  
  
 It all started when we found out the gender of the baby. We didn’t do a gender reveal and decided to find out the gender at one of her checkups because we didn’t want to spend time making two lists of names then have to get rid of one after. So after we found out we were having a boy we sat down together and made a list. Almost all of the names she suggested were normal, until the one that caused me to write this post. She suggested we name our son Mune. She told me the name was from this movie she watched when she was younger and that it always stuck with her. I told her the name was a little out there and he would get made fun of for it. She claimed he wouldn’t and we started going back and forth trying to decide whether to add the name to the list or not. Eventually she agreed to keep the name off the list, we picked some that we liked, and I thought that was that.  
  
 Later on in her pregnancy her mom decided to throw a baby shower as it was her first grandchild, and my wifes pregnancy was almost over and we hadnt celebrated once. It was fine for the most part until we started to open the gifts. Most of them were normal baby things like diapers and bottles, until we got to her moms gift. My wife opened the gift bag and pulled out a blue handmade blanket. It seemed normal enough at first until my wife unfolded it and low and behold there was the name Mune written on the blanket. When I saw it i was pissed but didn’t want to cause a scene so i stayed quiet. After that reveal I had family members come up to me and ask me about the name and why i hadnt told them. I didnt know what to tell them as i didnt have a clue about this either and just had to embarrassingly tell my family that, which pissed me off even more.  
  
 Once the event ended and me and my wife went home I started to question her about the name. She got defensive and told me that it was a good name and that i was overreacting about it. I brought up the earlier points and told her it was a stupid name for a kid and if she wanted to name something Mune so bad she could use the name for a dog. She got upset and called her mom to come get her. After she left she called me and told me she wouldn’t be coming back for awhile. Everyone ive talked to about this has said im not the asshole, but now that my wife has been gone and ive been thinking about it I feel like I could have handled the situation better. Aita?

My husband is a blue collar worker in construction. He works long days, his job is pretty physical, and he works really hard. He gets up at 5am and gets home by 630. My days are usually around the same, give or take an extra hour in the morning.

Every single day my husband gets home, he wants to go to the bathroom and take a shower the second he gets in the driveway. This would be one thing if he was quick--but he takes at least 25 minutes on the toilet and 25 minute showers, and I cannot start dinner with the kids hanging off my legs. They just scream and cry every single time. I've started to ask him to wait until they go to bed, given I really only have a 2 hour window to get dinner ready, eat, clean up the dishes, clean up their chairs, get them ready for bed, get them baths etc.

He complied at first, but he's now telling me it's very unfair to ask him to sit in dirty clothes and be a sweaty mess for two hours until they get to bed. Which I understand it's uncomfortable, but you know...I've just been alone with the kids for 13 hours straight. Every day. I have stuff I still need to get done, too. My kids are in their tantrum phase as well, which has been really hard. 

He got really snippy with me today and said I was being incredibly selfish when I asked him to wait. I said I felt he was being selfish by running to the bathroom for almost an hour every time he gets home when he *knows* I have stuff to get done, too.

So, AITA here? Or is he?",Aware_Objective9275,2885,6347,0.7699999809265137,0.5983232226842069,1698789515,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kwlaj/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_shower_when_he/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-31 21:58:35
17eyun2,AITA for laughing at how my friend used her inheritance?,"I decided to post this with the help of my husband (who is unsure if my behavior was over the line). Here's what he thought was important for the sake of the story:

\- My friend of about 17 years (Delilah, 37f) had a very problematic childhood. She barely went to school because her only parent was addicted to substances among many other problems. I don't know how she slipped through the system for so long but she was pretty much a lost cause by high school because of how little discipline she had. 

\- At 23 her dad died and due to the matter of death, Delilah won a somewhat large sum of money.

\- Once she got that money, Delilah chose to go to a community college. I guess she learned to love learning and had so many interest she never knew about that she went to several schools in most of her 20s and came out with several degrees.

So my view: I've held my tongue on her wasting so much money on school. I guess if it was my money I'd want to save it or explore then get a degree, not go head first. She has 6 degrees and to me it's just silly. The real kicker is my husband is an engineer and makes more than she does, despite all her side jobs and projects. 

Well we were visiting her and she mentioned how she wanted to study history and maybe take a class or two online for the fun of it. I laughed and asked if any of her inheritance was still even left. She said that shouldn't be my concern. I admitted it was ridiculous, she could have just bought a nice house with that money, instead of blowing it on degrees that she doesn't even use.

She told me all her degrees served a purpose, she loves what she does now and loves learning because she was deprived of it as a child. She told me she wasn't going to defend herself to someone who did not grow in a similar situation.

My husband told her to calm down. After is now awkward and I'm not sure if I need to apology or not. AITA?",FattyPatty4,6845,2698,0.7699999809265137,0.4458247062236446,1698104885,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17eyun2/aita_for_laughing_at_how_my_friend_used_her/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-23 23:48:05
17gii96,"AITA For accidentally letting my sisters friends I have a ""crunchy vegan baby""?","To preface: I do NOT have a crunchy vegan baby and I think this is mostly a misunderstanding. 

My daughter is six months old and breastfed. I am vegan, my husband isn't, and our toddler is vegetarian/vegan-ish (he doesn't like animal dairy but will ravish eggs). We don't cook meat in the home, although my husband eats it out of the home, and our toddler isn't a fan. Before anyone jumps on my ass he has been introduced to it because his dad eats it. He just prefers fries. (Same, kid).

Anyway, I took my daughter to my parents house about a week ago. My mom is also vegan so we were eating our tofu and rice. My daughter has just started solids so she was also going ham on my plate. My parents dog ate more than I did.

My younger sister (15) had her friends over. They were having burgers or something and watching me with my daughter. After I ate I nursed her and one asked if I was vegan. I said yes, she got this weird kinda look, and asked if my baby was going to be vegan.

I just kinda shrugged because, you know, she could be a dairy hating fry fiend like her brother or a cheese-aholic like her daddy. Maybe, maybe not. My sisters friend nodded and spoke to me a little more before leaving. 

I thought it was a little odd but shrugged it off. Teens are weird creatures sometimes.

Anyway, unbeknownst to me, this teen had decided I was a crazy vegan ""crunchy"" mom. Theres a few tiktokers who are apparently stupid about their kids safety and happen to be breastfeeding vegans. Like yours truly.

I thought all was well - my sister sent me a link on the importance of a balanced diet for kids among a few other bits and eventually I called her. I was like, what the hell? And she started going on about how I was a bad mom.

I told her to watch her mouth and she blew up and said I was the one with a ""crunchy vegan baby"". 

So, turns out, her friends are all convinced my children are terribly abused by my veganism, and because she'd never seen my toddler eat meat it was clearly true. 

I told her to calm the fuck down, explained my parenting, yada yada.

She them got mad because all her friends think I'm a terrible mom and I should have been clearer and not just shrugged her friends question off because I should have known what they would have assumed I meant.

I think she's being dramatic. They were worried, wires got crossed, all is well. She's still acting like its the worst thing in the world.

So, basically, aita for making a mistake and having my sisters friends think I've got a crunchy vegan baby?

As a side note, my husband was feeling petty so he went and got ribs for lunch. Filmed little lady eating her first rib. I can now firmly say she will not be a vegan, vegetarian or anything of the sort.

171q8sd,AITA for telling my wife nobody cares about her small business?,"My wife (27F) owns an Etsy shop where she sells handmade jewelry. She has some real talent and the jewelry she sells is genuinely very nice and high quality. She gets a surprising amount of sales on there too, and has great reviews.

The issue is that EVERYWHERE we go, EVERY conversation she has, she slips in something about her shop and tries to promote it. Talking to a friend? She'll casually mention a big sale she made or a custom order she got and not-very-subtly mention that she'd give her friend a coupon or something similar. Talking to our waiter? She'll mention that she has a pair of earrings on her shop that would compliment their eyes. Talking to someone online? She'll somehow manage to say ""as the owner of a small business.."" She literally cannot have a conversation anywhere with anyone without trying to sell them her jewelry.

The other day was a family member's birthday, and they were having a decently-sized get-together with just other family members and a few close friends. I went with my wife, and she's a pretty social person even outside of promoting her shop so she was quickly making conversation with my family. Of course not 5 minutes later she was showing someone the bracelet she had on that she made and mentioning that she sells them and talking about how since they were family she would happily give them a 25% discount. She probably had that exact same conversation with at least 5 people during the 2 hours we were there.

As soon as we left I spoke to her and said she needs to quit doing that. I told her if people were actually interested, they would ask her about her store, but not every single person she talks to wants or needs to hear about her art. She got upset and said that she just wants to spread her product and doesn't see what she's doing wrong and hasn't spoken to me much since. I feel like I'm the asshole since I will admit I had a pretty harsh tone and could've been a lot nicer during that conversation, plus I get she's just trying to sell her products, even if it gets obnoxious.

17ky8my,AITA for telling my daughter she needs to get over me grounding her as a teenager?,"When my daughter (now 26F) was 17, I left her home alone for a week while I was on a business trip; while I was away, she threw a party behind my back which ended with her and her drunk, underage friends trashing a significant part of the house inside and out. All told, they did a few thousand dollars in damage (including two broken TVs and damage to the car); the place looked like a warzone, or the aftermath of a bad teen movie. So, I told her she would have to pay me back, and that she was grounded until she did; no electronics outside of schoolwork, strict curfew, no friends over and absolutely no more parties, and she had to get a part-time job to start paying off her mistake.    
    
I wanted to teach her to take responsibility for what she'd done, and that meant no exceptions to the rule. It isolated her from her friends, I admit, but that was the consequence. She hadn't paid me back by the time prom came around; she tried to persuade me to let her go, but I was firm. She was basically grounded right up until she moved out.    
    
The thing is, she's basically resented me ever since. It feels like we haven't had a single pleasant conversation in nine damn years; she refused her college fund because she didn't want anything from me (she chose not to go to college at all - she went full-time at her job after HS); and even now it feels like every other conversation we have is her complaining about her senior year and how unfair I was. I've tried getting her to understand it was her own consequence, that I did it because I love her, the works, but she's still convinced it was all just me being awful.    
    
What's really brought things to a head is that recently her and her boyfriend had their first child. I've offered to help with anything they need, but I've been rebuffed at every turn, and when I asked if they were sure my daugher blew up on me. Apparently I'm not allowed to see my own granddaughter until I ""accept that how I treated my daugher is wrong"" and apologise for grounding her and forcing her to miss prom; my own kid told me that until I did that, she didn't trust me to look after or even be around her child in case I treat them ""the same way"".    
    
I told her that was enough; that of course I'd never be cruel to a baby or young child, that the punishment she earned was appropriate, and that she needed to accept she ruined her own damn senior year by being immature and doing things behind my back. In response, I got a long text from her and another from her boyfriend about how I'm an asshole and apparently I ""haven't changed"", and how I'll never be in their kid's life now. I've been talking about it with some close friends since, and while some of them are on my side, others have said I was too harsh on my kid at the time and that she's allowed to be upset. I've also had angry messages from some other family members about it, as well as some of support; it seems everyone's picking sides now.

16xgnuw,AITA for blowing up on boyfriend about him not doing shared housework and that his ADHD isn’t an excuse? I called it a misogynistic dynamic.,"My boyfriend (m35) and I (f33) have been together for a bit over year and living together for 5 months. Overall, we’ve both shared that we enjoy living together. When it comes to daily housework, we do a good job of sharing tasks like washing the dishes, making the bed, laundry, etc. 
There are certain tasks I find myself doing more, like cleaning kitchen surfaces and sweeping, and tasks he does more like mowing and grocery shopping. 

My issue lies with the less frequent, but equally important tasks. Things like changing the bed sheets, mopping, scrubbing the toilet, wiping down windows and mirrors, wiping off furniture surfaces, cleaning the shower, dusting baseboards, etc. He has done them just a handful of times since we’ve moved in. He sees me doing them, so he knows they are things that need to be done, and theyre overwhelming completed by me. I’ve brought up to him multiple tjmes that id like him to contribute more. He usually became defensive or gave excuses. He says because of his ADHD he doesnt notice when it gets dirty or forgets. In the end, he says he will do better and then takes up some of those tasks for the day, but theres no long term improvement. 

Today i found myself again working my ass off on these chores. i approached him again about my frustration and he got very defensive and downright angry. we both escalated quickly and it turned into mutual yelling. He again cited his ADHD as the cause. i said he does amazing at managing his adhd in his career and in other tasks by using strategies like setting reminders, alarms, putting things into a calendar, etc. He should implement them for housework too if he cant remember. he told me to write him a list of what needs to be done and when. i said no because im not taking on the mental load of being the household manager and sent him a video about how it is unfair when women have to manage and delegate tasks and schedules for their spouse to do their share of the work. Eventually i just sent him a chore list and schedule i found online because im not sitting down for an hour to make one. 

the fight dragged on and at one point he brought up that i do things that annoy him too.. like when i left a candle burning and a throw pillow got a burn mark (we were both in the room when this happened and the pillow was accidentally nudged from the bed to the nightstand). i thought that comment was unrelated to the real issue. it ended in me saying i wasnt going to end up in a misogynistic household where the woman is expected to do most of the cleaning and manage when others clean. 

am i being unreasonable? AITA?",beigewoodtable,3119,2398,0.8600000143051147,0.2952062847667387,1696203068,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xgnuw/aita_for_blowing_up_on_boyfriend_about_him_not/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-01 23:31:08
17jfokn,AITA for signing away a house to my baby mama even after finding out she put me on child support?,"The mortgage is in her name but she put my name on the deed when our son was born. We were pretty much in agreement that it was her house. 4 years later, I keep our son on the weekends.

3 months ago, BM lost her job. She had me sign a piece of paper that said, handwritten, “I no long live at this address” because she can’t get public assistance unless she has proof we don’t live together.

My gf, who works in child support, says that she’s trying to put me in child support. BM had always said she’d never do that, but then my gf showed me the statues and. I ran this by BM and she said she withdrew the application when she found out.

Weeks later, BM says she can’t get mortgage assistance unless my name is off the deed. My gf says that something seems off. I signed the docs anyway, but BM told me the sig wasn’t valid so we agree to meet again to re-sign.

The morning of, my gf says “i just got an email that a letter addressed to you from DSS is on its way”. I text BM. She says she got a call about it and was gonna tell you about it this evening and says it’s probably just a notice, and that if she wanted me on it, she wouldve done it by now. My gf says she’s BSing and explicitly tells me NOT to sign the deed over. Says that I need to file for 50/50 custody. Gf tells me to call DSS asap.

Gf texts me an hour later with a voice memo with a rep from public housing assistance saying I do NOT have to be off the deed for BM to get mortgage assistance. I call DSS back and find that BM deliberately went and submitted the child support application. Gf tells me to stop all contact with BM and that this is now a legal issue.

But none of this was consistent with what I knew about BM. I called BM and she admitted to everything, but said she didn’t know about not having to have me off the deed. She said she is only using public assistance until next week, and then she is revoking the child support case. None of that explained why she had to have me off the deed nor why she deliberately put in a child support application. I stated that because i don’t NEED to be off the deed, I will wait to sign it over. She hit me with “so now you’re trying to withhold my own house from me?” And knowing her, if I pissed her off by not signing it, she would keep me on child support permanently.

My gf argued that I shouldn’t give up the only asset that may help pay off the child support one day. I asked my family and coworkers and they disagreed. Saying trusting her is my best option and that it’d be best to sign over the deed to keep the peace.

My gf said my BM controls me and that I am spineless and that I had no reason to give away the only asset I had. She even went all the way to say that she felt betrayed and that I chose to appease my BM over protecting our household finances. We have been fighting all weekend, but I genuinely felt like I did the morally right thing, as well as the only thing that’ll make BM drop the child support case.",throwRAbowlofchow,3231,2264,0.8500000238418579,0.2884671705504774,1698622012,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jfokn/aita_for_signing_away_a_house_to_my_baby_mama/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-29 23:26:52
178s9hl,AITA for not wanting my autistic sister to come to my birthday party?,"I (15F) am turning sixteen soon and I’m having a pretty big party to celebrate. I have a stepsister (16F) who is autistic. She is fairly high functioning but very spoiled and throws tantrums whenever she doesn’t get what she wants. When I was little, she would always ruin my birthday parties so I stopped having parties with my mom’s family. I usually have parties with just my dads family and my friends. This year, I’m turning 16 so I’m having a bigger party which my dad is mostly paying for but I’m inviting my mom, stepdad, stepbrother and half siblings (13M and 11F). I’m having a party with about 90 people and over the weekend my grandma is gonna take me and some of my friends and cousins to their cabin in the mountains.

I do not want my stepsister to come to the party or to the cabin. I know she’s going to ruin it. She gets jealous whenever I get anything and my dad is planning to gift me my dream car at the party so I know she’s gonna throw a tantrum. She always steals the attention from me and I just don’t want her there. I’m not inviting her to the cabin either because it’s just for my cousins on my dad’s side and my friends. I’m not that close to my stepsister. Besides, we’re going to hike, boat, ride horses, and do other outdoor events that I know my sister can’t handle. She’s gonna start crying if we try to go on the water and she can’t walk further than half a mile without getting tired.

Yesterday my stepsister told me that she’s really excited for my party because it’s at the zoo and she loves it there and she has never stayed in a cabin before. I told her that she’s not invited and she started crying and ran to her room. My mom called me an uncaring brat for not inviting her and telling her so bluntly. She said that her and my stepdad aren’t coming either if she’s not invited. I don’t think I’m the asshole because it’s my party and I don’t want her to ruin it.


UPDATE: I don’t think my moms family is coming. My stepbrother is coming because he’s 18 and doesn’t care if my stepsis is invited and I wish my little siblings could’ve come, but I’m not inviting her. I might do a smaller celebration with just them, but I don’t have the money to pay for that myself so I can only do that if my mom pays for it (which she probably won’t).",Due-Sale4970,5123,1170,0.9200000166893004,0.2667656709602367,1697412822,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178s9hl/aita_for_not_wanting_my_autistic_sister_to_come/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-15 23:33:42
17h8g6q,AITA for leaving sexually-explicit messages where my colleague could see them?,"I (35f) am a teacher at a alternative school where each class has two teachers. My coteacher (34f) is very in-your-face, in-your-business and doesn't understand boundaries very well. She is always looking over my shoulder, she will straight up yank my laptop away from me and look at what I'm typing, if my phone goes off she goes ""oooh who is that?!"" and things of that nature. I've gently tried to explain to her that I don't want her touching my stuff like that, she'll say stuff like ""oh, well I'm an open book, it's no big deal!"" When I've explained less gently to her, she borderline cries and gets into an anxiety loop where she accuses me of being mean and/or mad at her.

I'm currently in a long-distance relationship and my boyfriend and I rely a lot on sexting to keep our relationship fun. He's in a different time zone, so the things I send him at night won't get responses until the next morning some times. Today I noticed he was sending me (text) responses to photos I had taken last night about what they made him want to do with me. I want to point out quickly that there were no kids in the room at this time, and even if one had wandered in, they're too short to get my phone and too young to read. I decided to leave my phone on a tall standing desk by my own laptop while going to get a cup of coffee, knowing my coteacher would probably look at it.

When I got back, my coteacher told me in a very serious voice that I need to be careful about what I am doing at work because she saw my disgusting and inappropriate texts. I told her she wouldn't have seen them if she hadn't been looking for them, and she said that wasn't the point, that she felt sexually harassed but wouldn't go to HR about it ""because the children wouldn't be able to handle a change in teachers.""

When I got pregnant, I told my husband I wanted my sister (29f) to be in the delivery room with me. My sister is my best friend and I wanted to share this moment with her. Because the hospital we're going to has pretty small delivery rooms, mothers are allowed only 1 birthing partner. My husband was upset and kept asking me to reconsider because he wanted us to meet our child together. I understood where he was coming from but I was firm that I wanted my sister there and her support. He eventually got over it and I thought it was a thing of the past.

A few days ago however, my BIL's father passed away in his native country so both he and my sister travelled there for the funeral. Since this happened all of a sudden, my sister told me she is not sure she can make it back for the birth and needs to help her husband and his family sort through the estate. I was disappointed of course. I told my husband he could in the room with me. He just replied 'ok'.

17bx2pa,"AITA? My wife says I'm asking her to ""mask"".","Hi reddit. Sorry for this sockpuppet account. I am 34m and my wife ""Polly"" is 32f.

Like a lot of couples, we debrief after our workdays. Polly works in a high-touch, high-interaction job, so we usually say our hellos, make dinner, and then eat separately so she can wind down a bit. Then, afterwards, we sit in the living room and shoot the shit.

Polly has a mild neurodivergence that means she tells... let's call it ""branching"" stories. She will get bogged down in sidestories and background stories and details that, frankly, add nothing to the core story about her workday. That's usually fine, but I've noticed it getting a bit worse, to the point that, by the time she's done, it's basically time to watch a show and go to bed. I mean, I'm spending upwards of an hour just listening and adding ""mmhmm"" and ""oh wow"", because she says she gets even MORE distracted when I ask questions.

I brought this up with Polly, and she said that I am asking her to mask her disorder, and that's just how her brain works. I get that feeling, I really do, but I am starting to feel like I'm a side character here, because she takes up all the airtime that we set aside to debrief.

Here's why I might be an AH: I said ""well, we all change our communication styles based on context, right?"" And she said that's different, and that masking is not code switching.

178rrnv,WIBTA if I said I had a problem with my fiancée adding a ring enhancer to the engagement ring I just gave her?,"I’m not sure how I should feel here.

Last week I celebrated my 2 year anniversary with my then gf, & really went all out to make it an amazing weekend getaway, finishing it all off with a surprise proposal at the very end.

I got her a beautiful ring, simple classic style with smaller diamonds running down on the face of the band with a 1ct diamond sitting on top, it also came as a set with a matching wedding band that really makes the whole thing look amazing. I basically worked 2 jobs for months to be able to save up and buy this for her along with the rest of the weekend plans. The proposal went great, she was completely surprised & I even had a photographer lined up to be there inconspicuously to capture the moment without her noticing.

All week long after, she’s said how much everyone is telling her they love the ring & giving me kudos on the selection, etc. I didn’t have much to go off for figuring her style out because she’s not huge on wearing jewelry, which game me some anxiety regarding that so hearing that made me feel a lot better.

The ring size was a tad bit big so we had planned for her to get it resized sometime this next coming up week. Fast forward to today, she goes to church with her mom and is taking her & her daughter to a museum while I’m at work. While at her mom’s house, suddenly she texts me saying she might not need to have her ring resized after all now because her mom just gave her a nice ring holder to keep it in place, & sends me a picture of this ring guard/enhancer that, admittedly is very nice, but it almost swallows up her whole ring finger and completely changes the entire appearance of the ring I just gave her.

I told her I don’t think that is going to work after we add the wedding band to the ring, to which she replied she thinks can be split further apart to make that space. She then tells me I didn’t like it she didn’t have to wear it, but in the same text says she really loves it  and mentions this ring holder her mom is giving her is $3,000 so it was a very nice gift. 

Well, not that the monetary value is what matters here, but I spent just shy of 10 grand on her engagement ring/wedding band and diamond set. So I’m a little offended that she even feels the need to add the enhancer to it, which I’m still not positive will accommodate the wedding band after that is added after the wedding. & I just don’t like the fact that a wedding/engagement ring is meant to be from me and she wants to add more to it from someone else, even it it is her mom. To me, the enhancer is so big completely swallows & hides the ring itself.

AITA for feeling like this? Should I pretend it doesn’t bother me & hope I’ll get used to it, or that she’ll decide on her own to stop wearing it?  I’m worried she will take it this the wrong way if I try object to it, so hoping for some guidance on how to best approach it if my feelings are valid.",JackkHammerr,2262,2066,0.9300000071525574,0.2398449165535981,1697411348,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178rrnv/wibta_if_i_said_i_had_a_problem_with_my_fiancée/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-15 23:09:08
17jexkn,AITA for telling my grandmother off when she brought up the fact that I’m not married with children yet?,"I (24 F) am unmarried, with no children. Frankly I don’t have the most positive attitude towards marriage given how I’ve seen men treat my girl friends and the women in my family, and I don’t even think motherhood is for me. Now my grandmother is one of those people who are super old school (different times, I know) and my mom likes to remind me that she was already married and managing a household when she was my age, especially when I make mistakes. For my mom I brush the comment off but i tell my grandmother straight up not to bring up the subject of marriage with me and that I am not interested.

Today I served my grandma food and she was complaining about the presentation of the food. She was telling me “you eat with your eyes first. Is this how you will serve your husband food when you get married?”. To which I got mad and replied “I don’t want to hear marriage advice from a woman who got cheated on dozens of times and stayed while blaming everyone else but the man who owed her loyalty. You wishing for me to get married is you wishing me pain and suffering”. 

Grandma got mad and wouldn’t speak to me. My mom and dad said i was out of line, my siblings said she had it coming.

170w5oo,AITA for telling a bridesmaid she can't bring her dog to the bachelorette party?,"I (30F) am the maid of honor for my sister (32F)'s wedding. We're planning a bachelorette weekend in Vegas since my sister has never been before and has always wanted to go. We plan to be out of the hotel as much as possible, making the most of our trip. 

One of the bridesmaids (28F) recently asked in the groupchat about accommodations for her dog, a fifty-pound Australian shepherd. 

I was confused...she wanted to bring her *dog?* 

The bridesmaid said the dog was an ESA (emotional support animal) and that she likes to have her dog there on planes (we live on the east coast and will be flying to Vegas). 

We literally flew to Istanbul together not six months ago without this dog and there was no issue whatsoever. And when we get to Vegas, does she plan on just...keeping her dog all cooped up in her crate the entire time?! The hotel we're booking does have dog-friendly rooms, but doesn't allow pets to roam freely around the hotel room unsupervised - the dog would have to stay in that crate for god-knows-how-long each day. That can't be great for the dog. On top of that, our other younger sister coming on the trip is very allergic to dogs. We don't have the money to just let this one bridesmaid book her own room for just herself and the dog to prevent my younger sister having an allergic reaction. Unless this bridesmaid was willing to pay for a room herself, I told her she couldn't bring her dog on this trip.

I thought that was going to be the end of it, since this was definitely reasonable on my part (in my opinion), but this bridesmaid is now being super pissy with me and saying how it's sooo wrong and horrible of me not to let her bring her ESA. Bearing in mind she's been absolutely fine without the dog in the past on much longer flights. Bearing in mind I even told her she could bring the dog IF she was able to pay for a room of her own so that my sister doesn't have a reaction.

179jpz6,AITA for “disinheriting” my daughter?,"I didn’t actually disinherit my daughter it’s just what my wife claims. 

My first wife had drug problems and still got primary custody of our son. I was young and didn’t fight her on custody and when he got older we weren’t close so I felt awkward asking him to live with us. She tried to prevent us from communicated and moved around a lot so it was always hard to spend any time with him until he got his own phone. But now I have spent more time with him and now we are close. 

My second wife is hard working and very financially successful as an engineer. In fact she makes more than me. Our daughter takes after her, she is a straight A student and is going to be back in school to be a nursing practitioner soon. 

My wife is angry with me because my daughter and I aren’t close. She goes to her mom for everything and doesn’t speak to me much. We were close when she was young but since high school it’s like she pretends I don’t exist. I try to reach out but it’s met with silence. I think my wife poisoned her against me because I have spent most of my money on my son. My wife told my daughter I didn’t pay for an cent of college for her and my wife did all the saving for her college fund. 

I didn’t really contribute to my daughter’s college fund.I didn’t pay for any piano lessons etc. I did pay for half of the family expenses with my wife like the mortgage but my extra money has been going to my son. Partly child support but I’ve also been contributing outside of that. He didn’t finish school with good enough grades for college. I gave him money to upgrade his grades and helped him get a place to start college. He got 2 semesters in and then left because he was depressed. He has a lot of issues from growing up with his mother and I feel partly responsible because I didn’t try to fight for custody. I give him money for rent and he has issues holding down a job so he needs support. 

My daughter recently reached out with an schedule for her and her fiancé’s wedding. It had his and mom’s dance but not the father daughter one. I was confused and asked my daughter about that and she replied “we aren’t close enough for that”. I was shocked and asked her why she would consider us not close and she said “well you basically disinherited me”. I called her and asked her to explain and she said because her mom paid for college and will be helping her with her NP degree and I didn’t give a crap about her after middle school because of my son. I explained everything I said above to her and she said I should have split my funds and time between them. I told her I felt like I did and she got angry and said I didn’t and it’s like she was raised by a single mom and that’s why she is uncomfortable with having a wedding dance with me because it would be a lie.",Vegetable_Bet404,3562,1036,0.8799999952316284,0.2030093118390608,1697497934,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179jpz6/aita_for_disinheriting_my_daughter/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-16 23:12:14
17de736,AITA for refusing to sleep on the couch?,"I (32M) and my wife (31F) got into a heated argument after her friend accused me of hitting on her. The other day, on my way from work to home, I came across a friend of my wife and she looked like she was carrying heavy stuff so I asked if she wanted a ride home. At first she declined but as I was leaving, she changed her mind and got into the car. We had a nice chat whilst driving and all was well. I even told my wife about it when I got home.

Yesterday, I was confronted by my wife because I allegedly ""hit"" on her friend. I obviously denied it and told her the version of events but apparently I was persistent with said friend when offering her the ride. I only asked twice, and the second time was asking if she was sure. My wife insisted that her friend isn't the type to just lie about something like this. Naturally, I asked why she trusted her friend more than me and then she told me about how her sister's husband cheated with a friend. I was angry at how I was being compared to someone else based on a mere accusation and we ended up arguing. Then we were just about to sleep and she told to sleep on the couch because she didn't feel comfortable with me. I argued that I wasn't going to be punished for something I didn't do and after quite a back and forth, I eventually let her have the room and slept in the other one instead.

I woke up in the morning to yet another confrontation about why I didn't sleep on the couch. I was obviously baffled and asked why I would sleep on the couch when there's an entire other room. According to her, if one spouse tells the other that they should sleep on the couch, then they should do as asked to show that they're sorry. I pointed out that it was ridiculous, especially when you add the fact that I didn't even do anything. Things are now tense all because I gave someone a lift.

1781c9v,AITA for publicly telling my step-sister that the quote from her book can't be stolen from her because it isn't hers?,"My (F30) step-sister (F42?) wrote an autobiographical book related to a war in a region that's currently experiencing significant disturbances again. In her book, she used a quote that has been widely circulated for years. I googled it and couldn't find the original author, but people have been quoting it on Twitter, blogs, forums, and YouTube since at least 2012.  
My sister made a post on IG and FB, shaming another account for sharing this quote without crediting her as the author. She also included a portion of her book that contained the quote. In the FB comments, I sent her links to several places where this quote had been used over the years and pointed out that it's a popular saying, so she shouldn't take it personally. For content published in 2022, she said it was after her book's release date; for 2021, it was after the date she submitted the manuscript; and when I showed her posts from 2018, she asked what my problem was.  
I then messaged her privately, explaining that I didn't have an issue with anything. It's just a well-known quote, and many people often come up with the same ideas simultaneously. However, I mentioned that it's bad PR for her to claim rights to a quote that, on the first page of Google, doesn't link back to her book al all but to various other people and their content from years before her book's publication.  
She responded, saying I was insulting her intelligence. She said I'm entitled to my opinion, as is she, but accused me of publicly dragging and harassing her. She ended the conversation, then deleted and reposted her original post, removing my comments.

170wv5z,"WIBTA for ""telling on"" my neighbour for ""locking me out"" of a group meeting by refusing to engage the automatic door (I'm in a wheelchair).","  
I live in a co-op that has both disabled and non-disabled residents. I came up with the idea for a peer-support/help exchange roster, where people could help each other out if interested.   
Another resident and I set up a meeting to share the idea, get feedback, and potentially some money out of our ""social fund"" that people pitch into at the beginning of every year to finance group activities. The day of the meeting my wheelchair battery almost completely stopped working, and even though my co-presenter and I had agreed to arrive 15 min early, the meeting was almost about to start by the time we arrived, due to my wheelchair moving so slowly. I was right behind her, attempting to enter the room when she let the door close in my face. I gestured for her to hit the auto-door opener because there was only one on her side of the door. She neither let me in nor told anyone that I was outside waiting for the door to be opened. Instead she told them I couldn't make it because of wheelchair problems so people we pretty surprised when I finally found someone to push the door open for me.   
Later on my co-presenter admitted to doing this purposefully, she said ""why would I tell them, you already made us late I wasn't going to allow you to disrupt the meeting any more."" (We weren’t late, just not early, and once able to enter, it took all of 45 secs to join the group.) She also admitted to wanting to replace me with someone else because my wheelchair problem had frustrated and annoyed her. Note: this project is titled Advancing Accessibility and Good Neighbourliness, and the ideas all mine. I asked her not to use the language & materials I'd produced and she said ""I'll use whatever language I please"" and said I was ""deluded"" for thinking people wouldn't understand why she couldn't ""let"" me attend that meeting. (Anyone not using a wheelchair could just stroll in, I was the only she could've one kept out like that.)  
It feels so unfair and underhanded, so I really want to inform the rest of our neighbours who went to the meeting about what she did. Part of me thinks that's petty because it happened months ago (she only just admitted what had happened) and I still did get to attend the majority of the meeting.   
Am I the asshole for wanting to exposing her bad behaviour, thus potentially torpedoing a project that could help other people with disabilities?

175rrgb,AITA for telling my friend’s GF to stop this shit when she pulled out tarot cards?,"I put a TLDR right at the bottom

My (24m) best friend Lewis (24m) has a girlfriend who is super weird, not just in the way she acts but her whole personality too. She believes in tarot cards, palmistry, crystal energy and all that sort of crazy stuff.

He started to bring her to group meetups & she seemed like a relatively chill person, she was just chatting and smoking some pot and stuff. One time when I was at Lewis’ house though she started to ask me what my zodiac sign is & telling me what crystals “match my energy”. There was another time when one of our other friends was going through a breakup, and she just straight up said to him “i guess that’s what happens when a Virgo dates a Aries”.

It’s just my personal opinion that anyone who believes in this stuff probably has a screw loose up there. But I didn’t say anything cause that’s his girlfriend. She started to talk about this shit more and more. 

I invited Lewis round to my house one day and when he arrived his GF was there too. I wasn’t rude or anything, but also wasn’t super friendly to her because I didn’t even invite her. For a while we were watching a movie, until she pulled out a pack of those tarot cards.

She started telling me that she wanted to give me a reading, I said no thanks. But she started pushing saying that she just wants to see what my reading comes out as. I think the fact that this was in MY house and that I hadn’t even invited her made me fly off the handle, and I ended up saying loud, but not shouting at all, “I have a reading for you : stop with this shit and get real”.

She asked if I was being serious and Lewis thought I was joking. I kept a straight face and said I wasn’t, and that I was fed up with all this psycho shit. His gf started crying & calling me names and Lewis said “why are you being such a dick” before leaving.

A few other friends that know us all have literally agreed with me, saying that she tries to push that shit on anyone and they’re fed up too. But some others say that I should have just let her do it to get it over and done with. AITA?

TL;DR - My best friend’s GF believes in crazy spirituality shit. When she tried to give me a tarot card reading, i said no but she kept pushing. i finally told her “I have a reading for you : stop this shit and get real”. They got upset, but some of my friends don’t blame me. AITA?

Edit because I forgot to mention and someone’s comment made me remember : I don’t know if this is true or not but Lewis has said to us once that his GF has some kind of personality disorder but wouldn’t specify what. Idk if that’s part of the reason for her behaviour (I see some people saying that I’m assuming she has a personality disorder because she likes tarot, PLEASE READ PROPERLY. I said that Lewis has literally said to us that she has one, not that I think she does).

Last edit : wow I went to sleep, woke up and checked my post not too long ago and I’m very very surprised at how much attention it got. It seems to be mostly ESH but because there’s LOADS of responses I can’t really tell. I understand now I went too aggressive and should have just said no again. I guess that the fact it was in my house and she wasn’t invited along with the things she’s said to me & my friends in the past (e.g the example i gave at the start when my friend broke up) was what made me get angry a lot faster. I’m gonna apologise to Lewis (idk about her though) and then see where our friendship goes from there.

176jndn,WIBTA If I didn't pay for my stepkids private schooling?,"I (36f) have one (13F) child. My husband (46) has 4 kids (13F,11M,8F,6F) with his ex wife. Their divorce was very amicable and he gladly pays for his ex’s home and cash support as she was a SAHM. This amounts to close to 8k a month. He makes 250k (15k month net) while I make 400k (around 23k a month, varies). I would guess his ex makes 60k a year now.

We live in a high cost of living city so Ex's house is only 3 beds and ours is 4 beds (almost 10k a month). Before marrying me he lived in a studio down the street and he would take the kids during his days but put them to bed at her house. I lived in a two bedroom paying 4k, so my daughter had her own room. Now, his kids share a room at our house when they are here 30% of the time. We have an uneven amount of kids and can’t afford a 6 bedroom. I have put my daughter in her own bedroom. She’s only 2 months younger than my oldest stepdaughter and is with us almost all the time. Her father is out of state and I receive meager child support.

Between that and my daughter attending private school (started 2 years ago before we married), I pay a little less than half my salary every month to tuition and mortgage payments.

Ex wife is now asking my husband to either allow my oldest stepdaughter or stepson to have their own bedroom, and to send all the kids to private school. Quite frankly, we can’t afford it. I am making great money now but was basically paycheck to paycheck most of my daughter’s life. I pretty much decimated my retirement and got into big debt (100k) to start my business that just started thriving last year.

She is claiming I am treating my child like the favorite. I have always instilled academic values in my child- she has never received anything less than an A and has a lot of dreams. The other kids are great kids but they do not value education as much. I’m not judging, just evaluating, but the kids are different. They have been raised differently, and that's fine.

I told my husband we can consider private school for each kid individually as they get older and  they possibly get more academic rigor but sending 5 kids to private school is just out of the question. I feel like I am being expected to foot this bill because I am successful but I also have my long term financial security to work out. He has a healthy retirement (to which ex is entitled to half) and I have nothing to fall back on if my industry gets a downturn. My career is half his career’s age, I do not have wealth like he has.

I asked my daughter if she was ok sharing a room with her stepsister, and she said she would prefer not to since the kids are messy.

AITA for not wanting to pay for all my stepkids private schooling and changing up rooms?

Edit: My four stepkids share two rooms at my house which mirrors their living situation at their moms (13F & 11M) and (8F & 6F). This weekend we are going to figure out a room divider.

My fiancé’s step father married his mom when he was 3 and raised him like his own. His mom died from breast cancer when he was a teenager but his step dad let him stay at home until he was 26 and even trained him to be a mechanic like himself. I have a lot of respect for his stepdad raising a child that’s not his own and helping us both when we needed it. He co-signed for our first place because neither of us had regular jobs and income and when we bought a place he and my fiancé did all the renos. 

My own father is a deadbeat to me. He dated my mom when they were both young and then left when I was born. He didn’t give us money and my mom never asked which is crazy if you ask me. I found out after I as an adult that he never wanted me but she did and felt guilty because he wanted her to get rid of me. So it’s not like he wanted me to exist. He visited me a few times in my childhood but never let us see his other family so I have half singling I only met when I was older. My mom and I were pretty poor growing up, we had government aid and when I got older I realized my half siblings were raised in a middle class home and my mom and I suffered for very little reason.

17k7mvl,AITA for telling my husband to talk to his mother re: our newborn,"My husband and I just had our first child together after a couple years of trying and dealing with infertility. Our son came early, a month and a half - we spent three weeks in the NICU and it was a very emotional time for me/us.

Fast forward and we are now home and getting used to everyday life with a baby. We have been getting visitors pretty often compared to what we’re used to, and his parents come every couple of days. 

Lately, I have had extreme anxiety when they come over because his mother has been incredibly overbearing to a point where I feel insulted. Each time they visit, she is constantly staring and analyzing how I am taking care of my child and making comments on what I “should” be doing or what she would do. Mind you, my husband was born in the 80s and she has not taken care of a baby since. This came to a head the other night when she flipped out on me for sitting my child up to burp him. She for some reason believes you can’t do that to a newborn, even though it’s exactly how they showed us on the NICU. It would have been one thing if she actually had advice, but what she was saying made no sense and how she said it to me was incredibly rude and condescending. She also went on to comment on how he was dressed (not enough layers), how he was being fed (because he was drooling), and kept calling him by his middle name (see below).

I’m not a confrontational person, so when they left I asked my husband to talk to her re: her behavior. My husband also did not stick up for me as any of this was happening. This quickly spiraled into an argument, which yes is partly my fault because I was so heated about my MIL, and he told me that I’m overreacting, constantly miserable around them and I should “get over it”. Now he is saying that he wants to move out and raise our child separately.

I do want to add my husband and his parents are from a different country. They have lived in the US most of his life, but there are barriers at time culturally. Regardless, I’d like to know if I’m TA and overreacting - is this “just how I’m laws are”?

Last add: while my husbands reaction is extreme, other things I “complained” to him about my in laws leading up to this: his mother telling me I gave birth “the easy way” (emergency c-section), his father for some reason feeling comfortable grilling me about breastfeeding (I’m not for multiple reasons), his mother texting me two days after giving birth asking me not to name our child the name we DID end up choosing bc she does not like it (now she refuses to call him by anything but his middle name), his parents questioning what I was doing that caused our son to come early..",DreamerInTheThreads,3639,368,0.959999978542328,0.1530102499078657,1698710363,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k7mvl/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_talk_to_his_mother/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-30 23:59:23

The side effects and healing process from the procedure are at their worst yesterday and today. I'm not supposed to do anything strenuous including hiking, kicking, jumping, or running for two weeks. 

My in-laws came into town for a week and we haven't seen them in 9 months. My spouse booked a reservation for a tour at a national park a few months ago, not knowing I would be undergoing this medical treatment.

On the 3 hour car ride to the town with the national park, my spouse decided he wanted to stop by an additional national park to hike. This is a national park we hiked at previously last year. I was not feeling well. They went to hike while I waited in the car. I was annoyed but it wasn't a big deal.

Today, after a hotel stay, we went on the tour. It involved hiking 3 miles downhill mostly. I was mostly fine but in pain towards the end. To my surprise, my spouse decides to go on another hike at the national park from yesterday. It's a 4 mile hike. I'm in too much pain from the 3 mile hike I wasn't supposed to do in the first place today. I say I don't think it's fair to ditch me in the car alone like this. They all leave anyway.

I'm currently alone in the car by myself and shocked I have signal. I'm pissed and I don't think I plan on talking to them the rest of the day. I'm tempted to just take the car and drive off.. I feel like it's extremely selfish to ditch me here at a park only a couple hours away from home which we've all been to before, not just yesterday, but previously when I was able to hike.

174589z,AITA for telling my MIL she can no longer have contact with my son?,"I’m a single mom (F42) of four- Arden (F13), Briony (F11), Robin (M10), and Kaya (F7). All of us, except Robin, are Deaf, with ASL as our first language. Arden and Briony’s dad (M46) left when the girls were 4 and 2, and I met Kaya’s dad, Alex (M43) shortly after. He had just come into custody of his nephew, Robin.   
Robin’s bio mom (Layla, F47) gave Robin up to focus on recovering from her long-term drug addiction. Robin is fully aware of who his bio mom is, but considers Alex to be his dad, and has called me his mom since the age of 2/3ish. Layla has told me in the past how grateful she is for me filling that role, and that she feels more like Robin’s aunt than his mom. All this to say, when Alex was diagnosed with cancer two years ago, it was pretty clear to all of us that I would continue to raise Robin as my son after Alex’s death.  
Alex passed away in June, and ever since, his mom has been causing problems. While she’s never been outwardly hostile towards me/my children, she often complains about our use of ASL (Most of the family learnt at least some basics to support communication, but MIL insisted she was too old and couldn’t do it) and has made comments in the past about my inability as a mother due to my deafness. My older girls are practically non-existent to her, and she often ‘forgets’ that Kaya is her grandchild too and focus solely on Robin.  
MIL spent most of the funeral telling people that I was ‘unfit’ and trying to ‘steal Robin away from his real family’. It was hurtful, to say the least, and made me uncomfortable welcoming MIL into my home after that, but I convinced myself that it was for the benefit of the kids- they’ve just lost their dad. I didn’t want to take away a grandparent too.   
Last Saturday, Robin came back from an outing with MIL looking miserable. He wouldn’t talk to anyone about what had happened and spent the rest of the weekend shut away in his room. I tried to ask MIL what was going on, but she didn’t answer any of my messages. Finally, Robin broke down in tears, asking me if ‘Grandma was really going to take him away’. It turns out that MIL has been repeatedly telling Robin that she’s going to take him away from us, even telling him she’ll call CPS on me to have the kids removed. On Saturday, MIL had gone even further, saying she could just drive away with him, and he’d ‘never have to see us again’.   
I immediately sent MIL a message informing her that she was no longer welcome in my home or near any of the kids, and let Layla know what was going on and that she was still welcome to visit/have Robin to stay, if MIL was nowhere nearby. My phone has been blowing up ever since, with people asking me to reconsider. I haven’t said anything about what happened, so can only assume MIL is spreading false information, but all the negative responses are making me doubt if I’m actually in the right here.

178red6,AITA for telling my sister her jealousy over something that happened at my wedding is stupid and pointless and that it’s really not my problem causing her to cry?,"Sorry for the long title. This whole situation is unbelievably stupid.

I (40M) recently got married to my girlfriend of 3 years Lexi (36F) but I’ve known her for 12 years and this is a second marriage for both of us. We met through work but were both very good friends for many years before we got together. So I knew her when she was married to her ex-husband and she knew me when I was with my ex-wife. She came into the relationship with 2 daughters, Hannah who is now 14 and Daisy who is now 6 and I’ve had the joy of knowing them as the kids of one of my best friends and as my own stepkids. Their father left when Lexi was pregnant with Daisy and nobody has seen or heard from him in 7 years, so he completely abandoned Lexi and the girls. My own marriage broke down a year later in 2017 due to my wife cheating. It was a shitty time all round and Lexi and I relied on each other a lot but our friendship didn’t progress romantically until 2020.

I love both Lexi and the girls very much but I have never tried to force myself as a father to them, since I knew Hannah remembered her bio dad real well and has struggled immensely with his abandonment. It happened naturally when Daisy called me Dad one day and hasn’t called me anything else since. Hannah has also  started referring to me as her dad but still calls me by my first name. 

Anyway, at the wedding reception once all the speeches and stuff were out of the way, my mom grabbed me and told me that Lexi and the girls had a surprise for me. Basically, I was pulled away and Hannah and Daisy asked me to officially adopt them. I never expected this and was so over the moon I cried tears of joy so of course I said yes. 

Word quickly got out and ever since my sister  Claire has been insanely jealous. She has stepkids of her own and they have a mom very involved in their lives snd they do not view Claire as a mom at all. She has tried to push it and it’s caused bitterness between them. My sister has made some incredibly bitchy comments saying it’s not fair that she’s been involved with her stepkids a lot longer and she is only viewed as their dad’s wife whereas after just ‘3 short years’ I’m already a dad.

I’m honestly sick of her trying to ruin my happiness so I told her her jealousy was both pointless and pathetic and it’s really not my problem at all that her relationship with her stepkids is different than mine and I made her cry.

She is now saying I’m an insensitive AH as she doesn’t have bio kids and it’s the closest she’ll get even though I don’t have bio kids myself.
My mom says she is being childish but some others think I need to show compassion.",regulardadsunite,3703,168,0.9700000286102296,0.1394359486244147,1697410283,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178red6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_jealousy_over/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-15 22:51:23
17cp1kz,AITA for throwing my friend’s girlfriend out of my house?,"I (35F) have been friends with Alex and Adam (twins 35M) since our mom’s were pregnant with us. Literally grew up together including them being only 3 days older than I am. Alex got engaged several months ago and the wedding is the weekend before Halloween. I love his fiance, Kelly (30F) she’s a beautiful human. Adam started dating a girl a few weeks ago, Jordan (28F). Jordan is the definition of spoiled brat. Only child who has never been told no and quite obnoxious about daddy’s money.

Alex and Kelly have their wedding planned already and are just waiting for the day to arrive. Ever since Jordan came into the picture she’s been trying to insert herself into the wedding. I’m currently 6 months pregnant with my third and final kid. My other two littles will be ring bearers and my husband and I are both in the wedding party. Jordan has apparently pulled Kelly aside more than a few times asking to replace me as a bridesmaid so I don’t “ruin the aesthetic” of the wedding. Kelly declines every time because we’re basically family at this point.

Kelly has told me each time she’s done this and spoken to both Alex and Adam. Alex as her fiance has taken her side, but Adam is staying neutral at best, avoidant at worst. My husband and I had both couples over last night for a chill dinner. Jordan immediately upon seeing said I look like a beached whale. So 6 months pregnant, not exactly small but I’m size 6 when not pregnant. I was livid. I told her at some point my belly would go away but she was stuck with her ugly personality and kicked her out of my house.

Kelly, Alex and my husband all think I was within my right to throw her out, even if what I said wasn’t exactly nice. Jordan did some more name calling and yelling before dragging Adam by the arm out of the house. I told him he could stay if he wanted and she called me a “boyfriend stealing bitch.” Doesn’t make sense but ok. Today Adam texted me saying I took a low blow and needed to apologize for being as asshole to Jordan. I don’t feel like apologizing, but am curious, was I out of line.

Update: (thanks mods) Adam came over earlier today and we spoke at length about Jordan’s behavior. I told him I hated the way she made me feel in my own home, and worse that she did it in front of my kids. I told him I can’t control who he dates, but if he wants to keep seeing her I would not be attending hangs when she is present. Adam said he and Jordan argued from the time they left my house and most of the day yesterday. He broke up with her and threw her out! He hasn’t responded to any of her messages. He showed me some of them and they are FOUL. He apologized to me for his role in all of this and not sticking up for me in the moment. Alex also apparently ripped Adam a new asshole yesterday and told him Jordan wasn’t allowed at the wedding. Adam told Alex about the break up and let Alex know if she shows up Adam will direct security to escort her out. Adam also apologized to Alex and Kelly. Adam told me he is embarrassed on behalf of Jordan and her behavior and told me hopes this doesn’t change anything between us. I told him we are family and that doesn’t change. I did ask him to choose better girlfriends moving forward.",Fun-Government-148,3347,314,0.9700000286102296,0.1388046664428689,1697845621,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cp1kz/aita_for_throwing_my_friends_girlfriend_out_of_my/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-20 23:47:01
16z704f,AITA for telling my aunt I will ban her from seeing my parent in skilled nursing if she doesn’t stop being so judgmental?,"I (45f) am the daughter of a wonderful parent, who, unfortunately, is facing the final chapter. My parent needs full time care, as they suffer from Alzheimer’s.  My aunt recently came to visit her sibling, and had an attitude the entire time she was here. When I finally pressed for an answer to “what’s wrong are you okay?” She went off on me about how my parent shouldn’t have to live in this place. She told me I am selfish for not having my parent at home with me, and was very critical of the care my parent is getting.

The facility is very highly rated.  I vetted several recommended through a social worker before I chose this one. Is it perfect? No.  Nothing is. But they are safe, which is the main worry with an Alzheimer’s patient. 

Also, my parent is combative. My aunt doesn’t see it, but it is true. My aunt lives across the country and only makes it out here a few times a year. 

I have a full time job and two teenagers at home. I cannot care for my parent full time. I just can’t.  I feel bad enough about this without her piling on the guilt trip. 

I am the sole power of attorney.  I told my aunt I can have her banned if she doesn’t keep her opinions to herself, and of course that only made her even madder. She does not get how hard this is.  My grandparents died in a car crash and she never had to deal with this horrible disease and these difficult decisions.

1700z9v,AITA for telling my SIL I paid for her honeymoon?,"Throw away account because family drama.

Before we were married my (34F) and husband (42M) were in a horrific car accident, both almost killed. Since we were unmarried we each received separate 8 figure settlements. Literal fuck you money as we were hit by a major carrier 18 wheeler in 2016. We both still work full time, I have a 6 figure salary my husband 7 figure salary. Sounds braggy, sorry, but it’s important. Now to the point.

My brother, Mike (38M), proposed to my now SIL, Alice (32F) in 2017 and married in 2018. I love them both and would burn the world down for them no questions asked BUT I think they see my husband and I as an ATM. Post settlements, husband and I paid off all our student loans. I have a master’s he a Ph.D. so not cheap. I also, without his knowledge as a surprise, paid Mike’s student loans with the help of SIL. Would have paid SILs too but she had a full scholarship so no loans.

Mike and Alice paid for their own wedding as Alice’s family couldn’t afford it but chipped in where they could. It was a beautiful wedding. They stayed within budget but Mike realized he wouldn’t be able to take their dream honeymoon and asked if my husband and I could loan him some money for the cruise he wanted to take her on. We agreed and asked him to pay us back within a year of the trip. He agreed. To this day we haven’t seen a dime but aren’t mad over it. Alice and Mike hit a rough patch with some health issues, then covid and now here we are.

My SIL can be a lot. She also likes to tell me how to parent my kids (5M, 3M, and 1M). She and Mike don’t have any and don’t plan to. Fine their choice. My oldest had his birthday party over the weekend and in true 5 year old fashion asked for a trucks theme. We decked the house out. Day was going well until Alice made a comment about my 3YO having a meltdown over not getting any presents. I told her he’s little and expressing emotions how he knows. Not a super big deal for me as he’s pretty easily redirected. 

She commented how I’m enabling him to become a “Karen” later in life and how she wouldn’t tolerate it if she had kids. I quipped it was a good thing they weren’t planning on having any and went back to my little guy. She said something to the effect of “poor parenting” and in a snap judgement I told her I paid for her honeymoon and she and Mike owed me $7k and once I got that money back I would take her input into consideration. She grabbed Mike and stormed out of the party. That night my brother, SIL and her sister blew up my phone calling me an AH for telling her. My brother is pissed because it was “supposed to be between us.” Something I don’t recall us talking about. I thought she knew the whole time.

17bx0zh,AITA for telling my wife that she's not welcome at my parents' house anymore because she's too loud?,"My wife, Karen, and I have been married for 5 years. She's a great person, but she can be really loud. She laughs loudly, talks loudly, and even snores loudly. It's not a major problem at home, but it can be really embarrassing when we're in public or at social events.  
Recently, my parents had a big party for their 50th wedding anniversary. Karen and I were both invited, but I was really worried about how she would behave. I told her beforehand to please try to be quiet, but she didn't seem to listen.  
As soon as we arrived at the party, Karen started laughing and talking loudly. She was also making a lot of noise with her jewelry and bracelets. I tried to subtly hint to her that she needed to quiet down, but she just ignored me.  
At one point, Karen was talking so loudly that she interrupted my mother during a toast. My mother was really upset, and she later told me that she felt embarrassed.  
After the party, I had a serious talk with Karen. I told her that her behavior was unacceptable, and that she's not welcome at my parents' house anymore until she learns to be more quiet.  
Karen is really upset with me. She says that I'm being oversensitive, and that she's not going to change her personality just to please me.

I chose not to abort, but soon after she was born, I realized that I could not handle having a baby while being a freshman in high school. My older sister (26 at the time, now 42) and her husband can not have biological children. They adopted my baby when she was three months old and I gave up all my rights to her. It was a difficult decision but it was right for me and her. I no longer see her as my daughter, but as my niece. She does not know that I gave birth to her.

A few days ago, I was having dinner with my mother and she suggested that I tell my niece that I’m her biological mother because she’s sixteen now and old enough to understand. I refused. I have a good relationship with my niece and I’m afraid that revealing the truth will ruin our relationship because she might think I abandoned her. I love her as my niece but do not have any maternal feelings for her anymore. She is my sister’s daughter and I don’t want to ruin their family either.

17jee5t,AITA for expecting a full refund for my daughter’s birthday cake.,"Today was my daughters 2nd birthday party, I went with a new girl that was recommended to be for the dessert. When I spoke to her over a month ago I sent her two different examples of what I wanted both decently easy. Price was not an issue, we would have paid whatever was quoted. 

We settled on an option for a 35 person 1 tier cake (marble cake with pink and white frosting with some glitter and white chocolate ghosts on it) and 40 ghost cake pops wrapped for part of the party favors. The quote including deliver was $180. We have been in contact almost every day this week confirming all the details. 

She was supposed to deliver it today at 9:30am to the party venue. Delivery cost was included. I paid in full in advance, and added a tip. $200 total. At about 9:45am she texted me that she was running about 40mins to an hour late, and would not be bringing the cake pops at all due to “an issue” and would refund us for them. At this post we are already at the party and guests are walking in, my husband ran to giant next door and grabbed plain cupcakes as a last minute resort. 

She finally arrived at almost 11am with a cake that looked nothing like discussed and was not even decorated as it should have been. She put the cake down and ran out of the venue. I texted her multiple times for a refund with no answer, she has since blocked me on all social media, and sent me $100 refund (half the total amount) the cake was awful and after cutting into it and trying it we ended up telling the venue to just trash it and went with the cupcakes instead.

176kogp,AITAH for feud w/ deceased husband's ex??,"My husband and I were married for 12 years before he passed away. We have 2kids together. He also has 2 kids from a previous relationship. When he passed away his ex expressed wanting to keep things the same and have the kids spending time together. However she meant the custody schedule meaning I still have her kids 50% of the time. I missed my husband and was always close with my step kids so I agreed. 3 years have passed and his kids are 15&16 and I still want them in my life however I want to start forming my own habits, traditions and vacations without her imput such as vacations on ""her off time"" and not taking them, me not spending enough on birthdays, her asking me for money for their sports and interests. 

When I brought this up she threw a fit, literally said I was abandoning them ""just like their dad"" and I'm showing my true colours and clearly I never loved them like I said I did. I explained they can still come over and will still have their own rooms but if I want to up and go to my parents that live hours away I don't want to have to clear it with her anymore because I also don't want them at my house unsupervised (not because I don't trust them but because they're still young). 

She has literally hired a lawyer and is trying to establish that I agreed to a custody arrangement and she wants child support since we always had more money. My husband had money set aside for his kids when we met and when he died I sold assets that were his and split the $ between all 4kids. His life insurance was also split in 5 for all of us. The house was mine so it was never written to be left to his kids. 

The estate lawyer set it up where they get money at a certain age and she got monthly amount to help raise them. I dont believe I owe her more. Some people in our life are split since it seems like I did agreed to custody but I was just trying to be a stable figure for them still.

I took Anne to the Prego Expo, along with our mom. We started talking about the baby shower and doing a little planning during and following the expo. Today I go a text message from Anne, telling me the date and location of the baby shower. I asked her why she was doing it in that location since we talked about another location. She said her husband's brother and his wife liked that place and they wanted a DJ at the baby shower and for it to be a party. I was taken a bit back since I thought mom and I would be doing the planning. Especially since mom will be paying for the location and she has a limited income.   Anne then proceeded to send me screen shots of table center pieces and shower decorations that she wanted me to make for the shower. I was upset and it took me a minute to understand why I was crying. My plan was to ignore her for a few hours while I settled my feels. But she kept messaging, demanding a response and I finally texted her back. I told her I was upset about not being a godmother and that I felt her husband's family was taking over the planning and how my feelings where hurt. Anne texted back that its her husband, that she never confirmed the location and that I'm making no sense. I texted Anne back, telling her that  helping plan means involvement, and that I felt like I was not involved instead I was being told when things are happening and rudely being told I needed to do the decorations.  I also texted Anne that I clearly misunderstood my level of involvement and that I felt I was justify upset but that I will get over it. She has not responded.  My mom is now mad at me for upsetting Anne and she worried it will affect the baby. So now I feel like crap. I know it's Anne's decision on how much I am or am not involved in. My feeling where hurt and I should have kept them to myself since Anne is pregnant and it can affect her baby... Am I the asshole...

175qy8m,UPDATE: AITA for “ruining” my daughters graduation?,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bpmf2e/aita_for_ruining_my_daughters_graduation/)

Hi. It's been a while and I'm not sure if anyone would even care at this point but I accidentally logged into my throwaway on an old laptop and remembered this.

Quite frankly, I'm really embarasssed and ashamed to reread my original post. My attitude was terrible and it's one of those moments I wish I could go back in time and shake some sense into my past self. As many people in the comments predicted, I know longer have a relationship of any kind with my daughter, or two of my other kids. COVID and lockdowns did a number on our family, I'll just say that.

I've been doing a LOT of reflecting and therapy over the last year and I realise I've not been the kind of mother my children have needed in their lives. I have no contact with my daughter now - who has married and moved abroad now - and, from her wishes, this will not be changing anytime soon. I also have very little contact with two of my other children. My relationship with my final child is strained and I am doing everything I can not to break it.

After having logged into this account again and seeing that post, I find myself desperately wishing to go back in time and maybe I could've stopped the breaking of my family if I'd behaved differently here.

I don't really know what I want to say here. Maybe just hopefully encourage one person who has been deemed 'the asshole' to reflect sooner rather than later and maybe their lives won't go the same way as mine.

ETA: I'm going to log out of this account again now. Maybe I'll pop in again in another four years with better news. Thank you for the comments and advice I've received. And to those who think I'm beyond redemption, I truly hope you're wrong.

16xgjla,AITA for getting upset about my husband's sexist joke and telling his sister the truth?,"I am a married woman with a husband who sometimes makes jokes that bother me. He says it's just a joke and that I shouldn't take it seriously, but I think he's being disrespectful.

Last weekend, we went to a family gathering at his parents' house. During a private conversation, he made a joke that really upset me. He said I should stay in the kitchen with the other women and make lunch for him and the men in the family because that was my role. He laughed at his own joke and expected me to laugh too, but I didn't find it funny at all.

I got angry and told him he was being sexist and that I wasn't his maid. He said I was overreacting and that it was just an innocent joke. He said I had no sense of humor and that I should relax.

I walked away from him and went to the living room. His sister (my sister-in-law) noticed that I was upset and asked me what had happened. I told her the truth, and she was furious. She said her brother was an idiot and that she was going to talk to him. She told the other women in the family what he had said, and they were all outraged. They all went to talk to him and criticized him for the sexist joke. He felt embarrassed and tried to justify himself, but no one accepted it.

When we got back home, he sulked and said that I and the women in the family took his joke too seriously. He said it was just a joke, and I shouldn't have said anything.

Then he told me his religion doesn’t allow him to live with a dog and asked me to rehome my dog. I said no to that. I told him he can’t expect me to rehome my dog for him. He was really angry at my answer and shouted at me that I was a bad brother. I replied that he can take his religion to some place place because it doesn’t apply to me and that he can’t shove it down my throat.

17k5zqa,WIBTA if I get married in my friend’s wedding dress?,"I (29F) am getting married next May to my boyfriend of 11 years (29M). We have been engaged since the birth of our kid 5 years ago. Due to a number of circumstances, chiefly finances, we have had a long engagement.

I have been friends with Caitlyn (31F) since grade school, and although we are not “best friends” we have had a long and joyful friendship that means a lot to me. I went to Caitlyn’s wedding to her college sweetheart, which happened when she was freshly graduated at 23.

Unfortunately, her husband was found in a bathroom stall with his coworker at the reception. My heart broke for her, and I was part of her support system in the aftermath. She is now happily remarried with two kids of her own.

In planning my wedding, the one thing I’ve been struggling with for years is the dress. My body image is poor, and I have an unusually large chest that makes all clothes shopping awful. But I went thrift shopping last week, and found THE DRESS. It was everything I could have dreamed of, and it FITS ME! I literally fell to my knees crying in the dressing room. Right away, I sent a photo to everyone I could think of, including Caitlyn. She called me immediately. I didn’t see it then, but when I got home, I saw that I had multiple missed calls and texts from Caitlyn.

So, it’s her wedding dress from her marriage to her ex. Apparently, she finally decided to let go of it. Since it was so long ago, I genuinely didn’t recognize it. It’s also not as if she goes around parading her wedding photos. Once she said it, I remembered right away. It also made sense, as one of the things she and I bond over is boob size. I tried to laugh it off, but she said, “I’m sure they’ll let you return it, under the circumstances.” I felt sick to my stomach because it was obvious she didn’t want me to wear the dress, and I was already super attached to it.

I stopped engaging for the rest of the night and talked it over with my fiancé and some other friends. Opinions are split. Some know how hard this process has been for me, and think Caitlyn is being petty. Honestly, I don’t. I get where she’s coming from. But I literally cannot keep looking. And it was $30. I have a 5 year old. I would love to spend wedding dress money on her instead.

Some say that it’s not only a bad omen, but disrespectful to ask Caitlyn to look at me in her dress. Imo, Caitlyn has moved on and has a family. If the roles were reversed, I would be thrilled for her. That said, I do understand that I could be the AH by reminding a friend I do love of one of the worst day of her life.

I tried talking to her about it the next day, but she has been firm on not attending my wedding if I wear the dress. She actually said she is rethinking the friendship in general. I am gutted, and don’t really think that’s fair. I would love to find a solution that allows me to keep the dress and my friend, which is why I am posting here. AITA?

174yb8g,AITA for not defending FIL in a feud on my pregnancy announcement post?,"When I announced my pregnancy on social media 3 weeks ago, FIL was upset that baby would be taking my last name. He commented that his last name sounded “much better.” My brother and a couple friends responded to him. They told him he was being weird and he insisted it wasn’t weird to expect his grandchild to have HIS last name. My brother called him stupid (not saying I agree with this but it happened) and it snowballed from there. 

I never once intervened but my MIL called my bf to complain about me. She said they’re tired of dealing with me, they refuse to keep eating my “shit sandwich” and they will not walk on eggshells. She was upset her husband got attacked in my comments. I ended up taking the phone and told her it was not my responsibility to moderate a feud that he initiated and publicized on MY announcement post. Basically we argued for an hour. She insisted I was in the wrong, I should’ve stuck up for him and I had no reason to be so upset and I am too sensitive (no one ever even told her I was upset?). 

I called FIL after because MIL told me that’s what I should do. He told me he doesn’t give a fuck about me or the baby anymore as it won’t have his last name. 

I really don’t see the issue in me not defending him. I think he has been a bully his whole life and wants to whine now that someone stuck up to him (I don’t necessarily agree with my brother insulting him but I also don’t see how it’s my fault that he did). I refuse to apologize for not intervening and they have cut contact completely until I do.

17ioa5q,AITA For Not Giving Stuff To People Having a Second Kid?,"I got SO MUCH of the same stuff that are extras and I'm trying to sell them on Marketplace for some extra cash because we are struggling a bit right now, as bfs hours may change.

My MIL informed me of someone in the family who is expecting a baby any day now *this was a few weeks ago, she's now had the baby, which is apparently their second or third kid, according to my Bf* 

My daughter is now in size 4 diapers and we had a package of 3s left, I have no problem with her bringing that to the family member, I've given away free diapers before just because our baby shower had an amazing turnout and we didn't need to buy diapers until the 5month mark. 

Anyway, my MIL sees me listing this bundle, it includes 3 teethers, a toy I have THREE of, and do not need another of, and a 3 month clothing item. I'm selling it for $15, which is cheap considering the entire bundle is $30-$40. I also said I'm giving away more 0-3 or 3-6 freebies if they buy the bundle. Kids are expensive, kids!! 

She calls me, furious that I didn't think to give the bundle to the family considering they have a girl. I asked my boyfriend beforehand if it's their first kid, or second? I feel that that matters mostly because it shows they either do, or don't need it. My MIL is PISSED saying ""How dare you assume they can't afford this child! How stupid do you think they are!?"" I tell her, I'm sorry, but when people plan to have a second (third???) Child together, typically they make sure they can afford it. I also have over 11 listings to try and bring in around $70, I want to give my daughter a fantastic birthday/Christmas.

She's not happy I'm not giving away the bundle. So, AITA?

Edit; OK, I'm getting mixed responses here saying I'm TA about my attitude towards having second children. In my opinion, if you can't afford kids, you should not have them. So many women/families can/are living off of welfare with 6+ kids being neglected. Also *huge disclaimer* I'm not just giving away gifts from the baby shower. I'm giving away all the extras or things that simply do not and will not fit. She has at least 100 outfits, many of which are duplicates! 

Edit #2, I guess since people don't understand what i am saying; 
I am solely referring to people who legitimately take advantage of the system, people who are drug addicts with no business having children (hiya, that's me, I was born to a drug addict and adopted!) People who FAKE disabilities, people who sell their food stamps, I could keep going on. Because it's very true people take advantage of the system. I am not one of those people. I am trying to get on disability and also still work part time to provide, due to a chronic illness that popped up immediately after pregnancy and hasn't ceased since. I understand why people would find me to be a hypocrite, but when I say we have so and so to our name, this is genuinely the first time it has ever happened, as my free phone STB and I need a phone plan; it's not like I'm a lot of people, who DONT use protection then are shocked Pikachu face that they're not invincible to getting pregnant, and, again, up until this point we've had assistance such as snap, wic, medicaid, and hopefully soon SSDI. 

Edit #3; I see what many of you are saying and why my attitude about eugenics is wrong. One person even said I as being racist (????????) It's definitely hypocrisy, but at the end of the day, the entire reason I'm not giving these people the things I'm selling is because #1, ive never met them, #2, bf has never met them, #3, I already gave them a package of diapers, and #4 I automatically assume if this IS their second or third kid... well, then, you would hope that they would still have some things leftover from the first, money saved up, (ik, ik, hypocrisy because for the first time ever we are struggling. Thankfully our child has everything under the sun and more) financially well off, etc ",Chickpeapee,1143,560,0.8600000143051147,0.0830697299136138,1698530495,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ioa5q/aita_for_not_giving_stuff_to_people_having_a/,2023,10,AmItheAsshole,2023-10-28 22:01:35
17rqn50,AITA for asking Future MIL not to tell my toddler they make her sad?,"My (28F) oldest son is 3yo My fiancé’s (32M) Mom came over few weeks ago & when leaving, asked my 3yo for a hug. He initially said “no” & walked away. Came back unprompted & hugged her. She said “oh good bc I was going to be sad”. W my fiancé’s, aunt’s &bestfriend’s edits, I sent her this:

(Summed up):
“We’re teaching 3yo that he’s in control of his own body & self-defined boundaries regardless of how it makes someone feel. If he’s trying to make someone upset on purpose, that’s a different story. We don’t want him to go against his boundaries to make someone feel better. I’m sure you just want to show he’s important to you but we’d appreciate it if you could show it in a different way.”

FMIL: “OP, I’d appreciate you not sending me these kinds of messages and we have these conversations in person. Thank you”

OP: “I don’t really see a difference to be honest. I would’ve said the same things in person. I didn’t see this topic as one that needs to be discussed too much. If you have a response I’m obviously open to hearing it, but it won’t change the fact that saying things that could make my kids feel guilty & responsible for other’s feelings will be accepted. Again, you can show that you care for the boys but not in ways that make them feel bad.”

FMIL: “Bc having adult conversation via text I believe are pretty cowardess. When you address me or any other adult, via text, it’s not really appropriate, so I will end this conversation with if you can't talk things over with me instead of telling me what ""not"" to do then that in itself is a problem. So I'm done.”

OP: “Again, I would say the same words to you in person, nothing cowardess about the method I choose to say these words. The reason I didn’t see it made sense to do it in person is bc I’m essentially asking you a favor & it’s your choice to acknowledge it or not. I wasn’t looking for a debate about it, just asking that you please not make certain comments to my babies.”

I’m alright if she’d prefer me to discuss something like this in person, but why ignore my initial message? Seems like blameshifting/diverting to me.

She then went to my fiancé & txted him “so by now I’m sure “OP” told you she was messaging me, if you guys have something you need to say to me just say it”. They had a 30min phone call & my fiancé told me she said:

- she’s already distanced herself from coming over & she’ll distance herself more if she has to
- it’s not something she was doing intentionally (I never said it was intentional, just bringing her attention to this and potential repercussions)

Chose to message her bc I’m HORRIBLE at having deep/stressful convos in person (I have ADHD so can’t process what I want to say & what other person is said & formulate responses,etc) also this is a boundary so not rly up for discussion or debate. Either she chooses to stop or doesn’t.

1834tvx,AITA for not changing my dog's name when my new neighbor's child had the same name?,"I (36M) am the owner of a Great Pyr/Australian Cattle Dog mix named Charlotte (6F). I live in a lower-middle class suburb in an unspecified United State. I have lived here for about a year now, and I let Charlotte out to go potty roughly six or so times a day. It's always the same routine: I open the back door, Charlotte runs outside to pee and ""patrol"" the yard (apparently it's a Pyr thing), and doesn't typically come bounding back to the door until I poke my head out and call her name.

About a week or two ago (maybe longer if I didn't notice) new neighbors moved in across my back alley. I had no intentions of interacting with them whatsoever, like ever, except today when I was executing the last step of Charlotte's aforementioned potty protocol.

I stuck my head out and called her name, but this time, alongside the familiar sounds of my dog galloping up the porch steps, was an adult human voice shouting something along the lines of ""WHY ARE YOU CALLING MY DAUGHTER??"" At first I thought it might just be my new neighbors getting into a spat, until a couple minutes later I heard pounding on my front door.

I opened the door to an angry man about twice my size glaring me down. He said something like ""Why the eff are you calling my daughter into your house"" and I responded ""Your daughter's name is Charlotte?"" and he just kind of kept glaring at me?? In absence of a response I followed up with ""Charlotte is my dog's name, dude"" and he rolled his eyes at me and said I ""better"" change my dog's name because he doesn't want his daughter (2F) getting confused and running into my house.

I told him that's not going to happen because not only did my dog have the name first, we also lived here first, plus I don't like strangers making demands of me before even attempting to be polite. What I DIDN'T say but really wanted to say is that teaching his child stranger danger is his responsibility, not mine.

He called me stupid and said that a human child obviously has priority over a dog for a name. I shut the door in his face and stared at him through the peephole for a moment before he eventually walked back to his house.

This last potty break, I went out with Charlotte and stayed in the yard with her until she finished her business, but this guy just kind of stood in his yard with his arms crossed and glared at me the entire time.

TLDR: I think it's unfair that this father demands I change my dog's name just because he chose the same name for his kid \[RUDE AND UNNECESSARY COMMENT REDACTED\]. But on the other hand, most humans think humans have priority over dogs for just about everything. AITA?

17vg85i,AITA for saying to my wife that I’m the one who gets to make decisions about my niece?,"My (43M) niece (14F) is being raised by my wife (40F) and I - it’s a long story, having to do with my sister getting herself pregnant from a deadbeat and proving overall unfit to be a mother. Bottom line is, I see my niece as my daughter and love her just as much as my own biological children (11M/8M). I know my wife also loves her the same way, however I’m legally my niece's sole legal guardian.  
  
My niece has practiced gymnastics for the past 10 years, and when she was about 7 or 8 one of the coaches at her gym took notice of her potential and suggested she could really make it as a professional athlete. I personally believe my wife and my niece/daughter were taken by this promise of future glory (“can you imagine if she competes in the Olympics one day?”, my wife said). I was always VERY cautious because I do realize the shots are slim; I also knew that could cost us a lot of money going forward, but the coach believed so much in her that they managed to cover some of the costs of her training on the gym’s dime.  
  
And when I say training, I mean TRAINING – some serious hard work. I told them I was fine with the idea as long my niece was happy doing gymnastics and it didn’t majorly impact her life. And then, last month, she tore her ACL during practice. We do have insurance, so the medical costs were covered. However, she’s going through a painful recovery, all the while wondering when she’ll be healthy enough to get back to the gym. But I told my wife I don’t want her to do this anymore. Seeing her get hurt and in pain made me realize this is a dangerous sport, and the toll it's taking on her body is simply not worth it.  
  
My wife said I couldn’t make this decision without considering what my niece wants; I said I can because I’m the adult here and she’s still a child. So my wife said there was still the matter of her disagreeing with my view, and that we were supposed to make this parenting decisions together. I then said that's true regarding our boys, but not when it comes to my niece. All I meant is that I'm the sole guardian in the sense of being responsible for her; what my wife got is that I was undermining her as a surrogate mother. AITA here?

My family and I (39M) traveled to visit my wife’s parents for Thanksgiving which involved a 5ish hour drive one way. My daughter (13F) had gotten the new Zelda game for her birthday a couple weeks ago and spent the drive playing basically nonstop.

When we got out, my wife and daughter were already in the car, so we got back on the road.

Not even half an hour later, my daughter announced that she had to go to the bathroom and asked if we were stopping soon. I’m not a dickhead (maybe an asshole?) so I wasnt *mad* but I was confused. I asked her if her stomach was okay, and she said that yes, she felt fine, and that she didn’t have to pee when we stopped but had to pee now. I gave my wife a look, and she stammered that she (daughter) said she didn’t have to go. Fine. Whatever. Dumb, but whatever.

I asked my daughter if she needed us to stop right this second, or if she could hold it for a bit. She said that she had to go, but could wait.

Another 10 or so minutes passed before she frantically asked if we could stop because she really couldn’t wait. I told her I would get off at the exit with a bathroom.

Needless to say, she didn’t make it. My wife is annoyed with me for not stopping immediately, I’m annoyed with her for letting her say she didn’t have to go when I suspect she just wanted to get back to her game, and we’re both annoyed with my daughter for wetting herself when it was easily, *easily* avoidable.

17qz4iv,AITA for telling my friend she is ungrateful about being a stay at home mom?,"The other day, I went to lunch with 4 mom friends of mine. I'm a SAHM and so is one of the other moms. Of the other other three, one works part-time and the other two full-time.

One of the moms that works full-time mentioned about how they had started to pay for a cleaner to come in every other week. They both work full-time and have two kids and were finding they couldn't keep up with all the chores. 

The other SAHM was agreeing with her about finding it difficult to keep the house clean when her husband does only a few chores inside the house. She told us her husband's main jobs are cooking dinner, cleaning the bathrooms, and looking after the yard. 

In my opinion that's a more than fair distribution of chores considering her husband works full-time. They have one child (10F) and no pets. I mentioned to her that it actually sounded pretty fair and that my husband has zero cleaning chores and mostly only cooks on the weekends if he wants. 

I told her as he works full-time to provide for our family, I consider it my job to do the majority of the household chores. This isn't gender related in my opinion, if we both worked I would agree about splitting chores equally or if I worked and he didn't I would be expecting him to do the majority of the housework. I have five children, the youngest two aren't in school and I'm a carer for my husband's grandmother yet still it's easy to set aside a couple hours a day for household chores. 

She strongly disagreed with me and she thinks her husband should be doing more and told me couples should split housework equally. I told her that I think she's being ungrateful to her husband who allows her to be a SAHM even now their child is older. 

In the end lunch was ruined, she called me anti-feminist and an asshole. Two of our friends took her side telling me off for judging her(?). Was I the asshole here?

18729yz,AITA for brushing my daughter’s friend’s extremely matted hair out so she avoid a drastic cut?,"My daughter has a friend, A (13F), who has been going through some health issues that I don’t want to put here. A’s mum passed away when she was little so it’s just her and her dad. Since he has started dating his girlfriend (we’ll call her C) A’s needs have been pushed to the side a little and he’s just not noticed that A has been struggling. She’s doing better now after getting the help she needed.

However, A’s hair has been extremely matted as it had not been brushed for months. A had been hiding her hair under hats and hoods at home and trying to disguise it at school in buns. She stayed over at the weekend and I only found out about her hair when they came downstairs after getting a comb stuck in A’s hair trying to fix it. I comforted A as she was ashamed about her hair but had hoped that she and my daughter could fix it. My daughter convinced her to tell me about it as she had been scared to say anything to anyone as she thought she would be judged as her dad’s girlfriend has made comments about her appearance when she was going through her health issues. When A was going through her issues, I made it clear to her and my daughter that our home is a judgement free zone and if she ever wanted to come to me or my husband for help then she would get it. A then asked for help detangling her hair. So that’s what I did. We put on some films and worked on detangling A’s hair. It took hours, but it was doable.

When A went home on Sunday, her hair was completely detangled and neatly braided into two dutch braids. She was happy and thanked me for helping with her hair. Then Monday I got an angry phone call from C because she was meant to be taking A to get her hair cut due to how matted her hair was. Apparently C and A’s dad had noticed how bad it was and C had told me that she would get it sorted. C is mad because the salon they were going to had charged her a cancellation fee for cancelling the day of the appointment. C wants me to pay her back for the cancellation fee as it’s my fault for fixing A’s hair when they were going to get it cut out. I told her that I wouldn’t be paying it, I just did the right thing by A instead of going to the extreme option straight away. C then said that A was no longer allowed to be friends with my daughter and they would sue me for the cancellation fee. It was £60 (half the cost of the cut).

My daughter told me that A knew about C wanting to cut her hair and A didn’t want the hair cut which is why she went to my daughter for help. A like my own daughters has long hair, so cutting the matted hair out would have meant her losing well over half of the length of her hair.

AITA for brushing out A’s hair so she avoided getting a drastic cut.

Update: This got more attention than I thought it would. I would just like to clarify a couple things. 1. While I am not going to go fully into A's health issues, the matted hair is the result of a depressive episode. Once things got better, she was just very embarrassed by the state her hair was in but didn't know how to fix it. So she hid it and it got worse. She is able to brush and wash her hair when she's ok. 2. A isn't being neglected by her dad. He knows he hasn't been the best dad to A and is trying to be better when it comes to her. Since A's health issues, he has been seeking help. I'm not going to report a man who I can see is trying to get better as a parent.

A's dad (I'll call him J) came round earlier as he wanted to talk to me. A and C had gotten into a shouting match yesterday because of the cancelled appointment. C had told A that she wasn't allowed to see my daughter anymore until I paid the money I owed - this was news to J - and A told C that she was going to continue seeing her friend. A also told C that she hated her and that if anyone was going to take the place of her mum it would be me because I care about A as a person not just her appearance. J wanted to know what had happened with A and why I owed C money. I explained it all to J and he was horrified to learn that C was going to cut A's hair short instead of helping her. He had been under the impression that the appointment had been to get her hair detangled and wouldn't have consented to A getting a big chop. He hadn't realised how focused C had become on A's appearance with her hair. He told me that he wasn't going to stop A coming around as he knows how important my family is to her. When her mum died and he fell apart, we provided the stability they both needed. I told J that A is always welcomed here and she knows it, but it's her dad that she needs. She needs him to be there for her and to support her through whatever she is going through, having her dad will mean more to her than having me there. J agreed with this, and that he knows he's not been the dad that she needs and is going to try and be better for her. He's asked if I could recommend a family therapist who could help them, and I gave him a few names. Since A started going through her issues, J has stepped up. He's not the same dad that he was when they started but he does still have a way to go to be dad of the year. 

Since speaking with J I've had angry texts from C, furious that I 'went behind her back' and spoke with J when she was dealing with the issue. In the string of angry texts she sent me, she said horrible things about myself, A and my daughter. I'm not engaging with her anymore, she's a walking red flag. I screenshotted them before blocking C and sent them to J's work phone (J gave me his work number when he started dating C because she had been screening and deleting messages before he saw them. She doesn't have access to his work phone.)  My daughter has been messaging A making sure she is ok, and she will be coming to stay at the weekend as she doesn't want to be at home when C collects her stuff. I'm not sure what is going on with that relationship, nor do I want to know but it does sound like J is finally putting A first.",NiorNightingale,7449,806,0.9700000286102296,0.4896412126281054,1701297605,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18729yz/aita_for_brushing_my_daughters_friends_extremely/,2023,11,AmItheAsshole,2023-11-29 22:40:05
1871n7d,AITA for not taking the baby as soon as I was asked?,"Our daughter is 7 weeks old. My wife is a full time SAHM (both of us want this until our daughter is at least 5, starts school and can openly communicate with us). I work full time making $25 an hour and while the pay is good, I've been looking for something a bit better just so we have more fun money, basically. I get home from work today at 3pm and she asks me to take the baby. As soon as she asked though, I got a phone call that I suspected was from an interview so I said ""hold on a second"" and took the call. It was an interviewer and he wanted to do an over the phone interview and asked if it was a good time. I said yes.

About 40 minutes later I go back in and my wife is cooking dinner with the baby strapped to her chest. I said I could take the baby now and she said ""looks like I've got it"" and dismisses me completely. She then turns off the stove (dinner was done) and goes in to the bathroom with the baby and takes a shower, with the baby. I go in and say she's being ridiculous and that I had to take a phone call and she snapped. She said ""I take phone calls while holding the baby all the fucking time. I cook, clean, shower, shit and shave while holding the baby. Your excuse is pathetic."" AITA for not taking the baby immediately?

17z9yjw,AITA for telling a coworker she isn't Native American?,"I was speaking with coworkers and the topic of a nearby town came up. The town has a difficult to pronounce name and my coworker made a comment about what kind of idiot came up with the name. I pointed out that it was a word is from a Native American language. My coworker replied with ""well, I'm allowed to make fun of it then. I'm part Indian, Native American.""

My coworker appears very white. From what she has told me, her family has lived in the same rural area for years and this is the first time she has mentioned anything about this. Curious, I asked her what nation she was from and she said she had a Cherokee ancestor. I ask if she is registered with a Cherokee tribe and she says no. I ask who the ancestor was and she said her great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess.

Here's where I might be the asshole. I am white and know very little about Native Americans but I DO know that white people love to claim to be Cherokee without any evidence to back it up. And that the Cherokee nation doesn't have princesses. I know this because my estranged aunt used to say the same thing while everyone else in my family said they had literally NEVER been told about Indigenous ancestry. A DNA test of another aunt proved this later on. We're just white. 

So (and this is where I might have been rude) I tell her that the Cherokee don't have princesses and she's probably wrong. She got really defensive and insisted it was true. I told her that lots of white people claim to be Native and aren't, and that with DNA tests there isn't really an excuse not to look into it. Needless to say the vibe became awkward quickly and this coworker has been ignoring me since and seemed pissed at me.

Another coworker said I should have just let it go and not said anything. My reasoning is if she's going to say ""I'm Native American so I can make fun of them"" she better be damn sure she's ACTUALLY Native American. And if she is Cherokee, I feel like she still can't make fun of a DIFFERENT tribe's language anyway! So AITA?

17sguih,AITA for deliberately ruining my housemate’s romantic date night with his boyfriend because they planned to use my bathroom?,"I (21f) live with my best friend (John-21m) in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom flat. I have the main bathroom and John has the en suite bathroom. My bathroom has a shower/tub combo, sink and toilet and John’s bathroom has a shower, sink and toilet. When we first moved in, I didn’t have a preference about which room so John took the bedroom with the en suite. 

The issue is that recently, John has been using my bath without permission. Normally I’m not super territorial about my space, but here’s my issues:  
1-	John is having baths that last 2+ hours  
2-	He moves my stuff around (shoves them into draws) and puts my loofas and flannels on the floor which is just unhygienic  
3-	He doesn’t clean up after himself  
4-	I’m not allowed to use his bathroom when he’s occupying mine because he doesn’t want me to go into his bedroom

I’ve brought these up to him and he always says he won’t use to bath anymore but he always goes back to it. He claims his knees are acting up (he’s being testing for arthritis in a couple of weeks) and that the commute to and from work kills his joints. It's been like this for 2 months. Every time I get home from work, John is soaking in my tub so I can't shower, pee, etc. It might seem like a small thing but it's incredibly annoying.   
  
Fast forward to a couple of days ago and his boyfriend (Sam-19m) is visiting. He’s seemed pretty sound and has always been nice to me. I go from the kitchen to my bathroom and see the bath has been turned on so I turn it off. I go into my bedroom to grab my towels and clothes and when I get back, Sam is in my bathroom, sitting on the toilet seat watching the bath fill up. I ask him what he’s doing and he tells me him and John are planning on having a ‘romantic bath together’. I turn the bath off again and say ‘well this is my bathroom and I need a shower so get out.’   
He stands in the doorway for a few minutes texting John. I managed to push him out and I had a nice, long 'everything' shower. The entire time, John is texting me asking me to 'hurry up' because him and Sam had plans and I was ruining them. I responded and said 'I'm in my bathroom. I've told you not to use my bathroom because you leave it in a state and you spend hours in there.'   
When I get out the bathroom, John and Sam are sitting on the sofa watching a movie. As I walk past them, John says 'are you happy? You ruined our date night.' I just shrugged and got food.   
  
However I guess John went and vented to our mutual friends who are split on who is right in the situation. But the general consensus is that I should have just sucked it up and let them use my bathroom for their date night.

17vf9b2,AITA for “dressing up” too much at my kids school.,"I F42 was told by my husband M51 that I shouldn’t dress up to go to our child’s elementary school. 

I love fashion and do tend to dress up. I don’t like wearing jeans ( I don’t like the feel and it’s hot we’re I live). So I wear a lot of skirts(usually tea length or to the knee and trouser type pants. I love finding interesting prints and cuts. I usually wear heels and only wear active wear to the gym.  I’ve spent a lot of hours cultivating my wardrobe.  I volunteer at my daughters school often, am on the PTO board,and do pick up and drop off so I’m there a lot and the teachers know me pretty well.  I’m also one of the older moms in elementary and my husband is the oldest dad. 

We were at an awards ceremony. I was wearing a printed jumpsuit with an asymmetrical neckline. One of the teachers told me I always look like I just walked of the set of Sex and the City.  I took it as a compliment, since it’s an iconic show. My husband said it wasn’t and she is saying I’m always over dressed.  He also said the other parents don’t appreciate me trying to show off since they mostly wear jeans or active wear. 

My husband is retired and rarely dressed up. Which is fine with me, especially since he had to wear a suit everyday for 30 years. It’s all personal preference I think.  I just prefer different.  He use to love my style, but seems over it since he retired.

I didn't say anything but the time passed by and it just seemed to get worse and worse. One day I saw her mother at the end of the class. For the record my students is black girl. She was adopted and her parents are both white. When I asked her about her daughter hair she just responded that she wasn't going to try to learn how to style them cause there is no point. I didn't respond to that and just told her I could do it if she gave me the product , I was already doing it for an other student and it didn't bother me at all.

184n60w,AITA for telling my BM that I’ll die before our kid graduates high school?,"Alright it’s probably a weird story but I really need the second opinion.

Me (23M) and Kate (22F) are parents of Mark (4M). We split up before he was born, and to be honest I’m not very involved with the parenting besides being generous with child support and occasionally having Mark over.

I have a chronic and terminal condition that recently landed me in hospital. I had a really horrible flair up and had to be admitted to ICU. To make it worse, it happened during the time I was supposed to have Mark over. I was unconscious and on life support and so I couldn’t answer Kate’s calls.

When I woke up, I checked my phone and saw all the missed calls and messages. Kate was very upset as I basically ghosted her, and she sent a lot of rude and judgemental messages. So I snapped a pic of me in the hospital bed with all the tubes attached and sent it to her with the caption “sorry was busy trying not to die”.

Kate obviously freaked out and apologised, and I, being high on meds, told her that “it’s okay just a normal day having X”.

Turns out Kate didn’t know about my condition. We didn’t really have a relationship, she was just a girl from my school whom I hooked up with and it didn’t end very well. And we don’t have much contact aside from Mark-related stuff. I don’t know why I didn’t tell her, probably forgot or something.

Obviously it made her freak out even more. Kate called me and started crying and yelling at the same time, basically having a breakdown over the phone. She said I should’ve been upfront with her about it back then, that it’s my fault if Mark ever gets sick (it’s not a genetic neither a transmittable condition so he’s okay btw). She also said it’s unfair that we made a baby who will lose his dad at a young age, and this is where I might have been TA. I said “you know what would be more unfair? Fucking dying before my only son graduates high school.”

It upset her even more and she said that I’m the asshole for making her and Mark go through this. I said it’s not my fault, she said it is because if I was upfront with her, she wouldn’t have hooked up with me.

187vzpq,"AITA for not being happy that my parents invited my son to my ""welcome party""?","I'll try to make everything as easy to understand as possible, but of course I can answer questions if I have to. 

So, when I (m29) was 21 I got a scholarship to study in Japan (I was a college student in the US). I was very excited to go, however a girl I was seeing ended up pregnant (we were not together, but were exclusive). Of course I didn't want a baby with my fwb, and also it would ruin my opportunity to go to Japan. 

I begged her to have an abortion, since why would any of us want that baby? We were definitely not committed to each other. We had discussed abortions before (as many other subjects), so I knew that she didn't have a problem with abortions. However, she decided that she was going to keep the baby. I told her that honestly I didn't want to be a father, but that I'll wait until the baby's birth because maybe I'll feel different then. I didn't change my mind when the baby was born. So we agreed that I wouldn't be an active father, but I'll fullfil all of my responsibilities. 

I had to cancel my trip to Japan to get a better job so I could pay child support. Thankfully my parents also helped me so I moved in with them, I almost had to drop out of college but thankfully I was able to graduate. I still wanted to go to Japan, so when one of my ex classmates moved in there to work I asked him to let me know if there was any vacancy at his company. I got a job there and moved in October 2019. 

Ever since, I couldn't come back to America, because of COVID and also because the rhythm of work there is harder, so I was always working and trying to advance in my career. Of course I continued sending the money for my son. 

Well, the thing is that I have vacation now and I travelled for Thanksgiving. I got here the week prior to thanksgiving and my parents prepared a ""welcome party"" with our family and friends. They apparently got very close to my son when I was not here and they invited him and his mother. To be honest I don't have any problems with them, but we don't have a close relationship either. 

When I went to the backyard (where the guest were) I greeted them both, but I was feeling awkward and we didn't talk much. When everyone left my parents told me off because they expected me to be way happier about seeing my son. We got into a bit of an argument and now my mother and father are upset at me for being so cold? I don't understand why they expected me to be happier, I don't know my son too much, he wasn't very excited to see me either. But it's been far too long and they're still upset, si I need some outsider pov since my friends are agreeing with me, but they might be doing it just to not argue with me.


Edit: I'm sorry, I didn't realize this was not clear in the post. But I didn't kick my son or his mom out of the party, they stayed till the end. I greeted them, I asked him about his school and his martial arts classes and he told me he's doing fine, so I congratulated him. His mother hasn't texted me at all to tell me that the kid's sad after seeing me.

My mom explained the cheating when I was older and realized how weird the situation was compared to friends with divorced parents. I have feels about it, but he’s my dad so I try to not think about it a lot. I know my dad’s wife hates me and is the reason I can’t see him more, so yeah, she has a reason to be mad at him, but also screw her.

So a couple of months ago, my dad started asking if I would like to spend whole weekends with him. I said I would be ok with it if it wasn’t at his house. He said his wife wants me to come and she’s had a change of heart. Sounded really sus so I said no. Then this weekend she wanted to come have lunch with my dad and me. She said that she realized how important I am to my dad since they can’t have kids now and that she would like to make up for it all and be my step-mom if I would let her.

It really made me mad because my whole life she’s made it really hard to see my dad and now she wants to be nice? I might be TA because I told her that if she can’t have kids that’s karma for how she treated me and she’s never going to be anything but my dad’s wife. She started crying and my dad told me later that was a terrible thing and I need to apologize. My mom said that she put me in an unfair situation and I should probably avoid talking to her right now because she’s having to deal with infertility and hasn’t really gotten over things.

AITA? I feel like she kind of deserved it.",_forestspirit_,4560,1172,0.9399999976158142,0.349592929930182,1700522931,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1802hkh/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_that_shes_getting/,2023,11,AmItheAsshole,2023-11-20 23:28:51
185gfj7,AITA for not letting my autistic BIL hold my newborn?,"My fiance (24M) and I (19F) had our first baby last week. He was born healthy but giving birth was very traumatic and hard on me mentally/physically. I had an emergency c-section after being in labor for three days. I still feel extremely foggy and out of touch with reality.

I only wanted my fiance's parents present to meet the baby in the hospital. The rest were welcome to Facetime us, but they would have to wait to see our son after we'd gone home and had time to adjust to having a newborn. 

I'm not close with my family because I left home at 18 to escape their abuse. Almost none of them are allowed contact with my child because of the way they treated me and my siblings. 

My fiance's family are a very close-knit group, and all of them have been very kind and welcoming to me up until this point. I wouldn't be marrying in if they weren't. The only one I've had issues with is my fiance's brother (30M) who has autism. He makes a lot of offhand comments and jabs that get passed off as 'dark humor'. 

When my in-laws got there, they brought my fiance's older brother who they care for and let live with them. He's diagnosed with autism but does not have any severe disabilities. I wasn't happy that they'd brought him against my wishes, but I didn't say anything after everything I'd gone through. 

My fiance's brother was adamant about holding our son. He was loud, had an attitude, and smelled terrible. His clothes were dirty and his hair was covered in grease. It was like he hadn't showered in weeks. Again, I didn't comment on his hygiene, but I tried to preface that I didn't want anyone holding the baby right now except my in-laws. I was as kind as possible. 

My in-laws told me that he didn't mean any harm and that he could wash his hands. I told them no again, and my fiance backed me up when they didn't calm down. My FIL law took his son home and my MIL stayed and apologized, but my fiance's brother is apparently 'deeply hurt' and texted my fiance to tell him not to marry me because I'm ""driving them apart"" and ""a bitch who wants to keep him from his nephew"".

I'd like to preface that my fiance himself has confirmed that his brother was not always this limited, and was fairly normal until high school when he seemed to start to play up his diagnosis for sympathy.  He hasn't worked a day in his life and lives off of his parents. He does not shower or even bother to apply deodorant before leaving the house. He would literally live in the same clothes for months if not for his mom doing his laundry. I have no ill-will for people with autism or disabilities (my youngest brother had down syndrome and cared for him as a identified child.) My issue is solely with my brother in law.",Ok_Substance_3119,4433,568,0.9399999976158142,0.2978818222098169,1701125683,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185gfj7/aita_for_not_letting_my_autistic_bil_hold_my/,2023,11,AmItheAsshole,2023-11-27 22:54:43
18346j8,AITA for telling my sister she has more than enough children?,"My (32F) sister (36F) already has 6 kids with her husband (40M), which is way more than they can comfortably provide for given what I know about their financial troubles, and also way more than both of them can handle, since it came to a point where my older niece (15F) is treated as an unpaid babysitter by her parents and constantly expected to help with her younger siblings.

My sister recently went through a miscarriage on her seventh pregnancy, and I understand this can be a painful experience, but as I was talking about this with her, I told her at least she has other 6 children in her life already and that maybe that’s enough. She got very offended by my comment and told me I was being very insensitive and that her family choices have nothing to do with me. (Actually it has because I had to loan her and her husband money in more than one occasion so they could support the household, but I didn’t tell her that as to not make things worse).

Anyway, am I really the AH here?

Edit: to be clear, my sister wasn't 7 months along when she had the miscarriage. She was in the early stages of her seventh pregnancy.

17xqlvd,AITA for asking my daughter to take in her grandmother for a few days?,"I (55M) live with my MIL (82F,) wife, and two sons in the suburbs. Recently, my MIL has had trouble meeting her friends in the city, and her whole day has been disruptive. She spends most of the day at home either getting in the way of chores or watching TV. It's not healthy for her, since she doesn't really talk much to anyone or go out. 

I remembered that my youngest (30F) lives alone in the core of our city in an apartment, so I asked  MIL if she'd want to move in with my daughter so she can see her friends more often. MIL liked the idea and even seems excited.

Next time I spoke to my daughter, I asked her if she could take MIL in for a few days just to try it out. My daughter kept saying no, that she has no room and she can't move anyone in, but I said that she could just put out a mattress and let MIL try living there for a while since she likes the idea. She asked me if I told MIL about the idea. When I said yes, she just hung up on me and she hasn't picked up any of my calls since.

17yhsua,"AITA for reminding my brother (42m) how old our mom was when she died, after he mentioned trying for a child?","My mother and father had my brother at 20 but waited on me until they were 40.

My dad died a few years after that because of health problems. My mom also had a long line of issues between and her family that resulted in immobility and lack of capacity. I was never really a kid because she needed someone to care for her and we didn't have the money for outside resources. She died when I was 19. Because I want fair judgment, I'll admit I'm resentful of my parents for having me when they did health-wise (not age wise - if they did not have so many health issues and had me at 40 I would feel differently). The roles just felt reversed. Maybe that's clouding my judgment. 

Many of their issues were genetic or a combination of genes with also negative health choices. My brother is now 42, in similar health as they were, and has expressed no desire to change or take steps towards reducing his risks of certain diseases. 

Him and I do not talk much and when we do it's very quick. He told me recently his wife and him were trying for a child. I didn't say anything because I didn't know how to reply. He later text me what was wrong? He said to be honest because it was clear I didn't like what he admitted and I told him both our parents died very young because of health reasons. I don't say that to scare him, but I was barely adult when mom died of things we are susceptible to. It's not up to me and he can do what he wants, yet consider how tough it can be to lose parents at such young ages and the impact it can have. 

There was no reply, but both his MIL and wife text me to say my mom was a brave woman and I need to get over what happened because she loved me, just like my brother will love his potential child. 

My brother wasn't around when our parents became very sick so I don't think it had a similar impact on him.

17n6ozb,AITA for ruining my wife’s friendship?,"My wife(34F) and her friend have been friends since high school. They are pretty close and she was a bridesmaid for our wedding. Recently another friend invited them to go to Italy to their family’s vineyard as their family was going to Spain for the month. So accommodations are free but the flight, food etc were extra. They left for 2 weeks. 

I was not aware of this trip until a month before it was suppose to happen(they booked it 2 months out). Recently I lost my job and had to get another one. It pays around half what my job originally did (120k>66k). My wife only has cashier experience and barely makes more money than it would be worth it for her to work as we have 2 kids (4 and 1). My wife isn’t the best with money, she does spend without thinking and she agreed to this trip without telling me. She had to beg her mom to look after the kids after she said yes to the trip and her friends booked the tickets. Her mom is from another city and came to live with me for 2 weeks as I had to work and couldn’t take care of them when I’m working.

I was extremely mad at her but allowed her to go as I know she’s been depressed since the baby and it was too late anyway. She asked her friend to cover her for the flight and she would pay her back. I knew it was hard for us to pay her friend back but it was a non refundable anyway.

She came back from the trip very happy until her friend asked for the flights. She had spent $1400 on the trip not including the flight and her friend wanted the $1200 that was the cost of the flight that she had put onto her credit card. We had $300 left in our account and already have credit card debt. We are thinking of downsizing our house to an apartment but it’s hard because as soon as landlords hear that we have kids they don’t want to talk anymore. It really sucks but I told her we can’t pay her friend back until I get a better job.

It’s been 3 months since the trip and her friend is getting angry because she promised to pay it back and we no longer have money. It’s not like her friend needs the money back, she makes six figures and has a house already, she’s not struggling. I told my wife we don’t have enough to pay her back and she will have to explain to her friend. They clearly did not have a good conversation as her friend blocked her and told their other friends about her refusing to pay her back.

17rpoot,AITA for showing up to the wedding even after bride said she didn't want me there?,"This involves me, JJ (Bride) and Calvin (groom). 

Calvin and I grew up together as sandbox kids/neighbors. Took baths together, spent every waking moment of the first 14 years of our life together from preschool to trips our parents would take us on. Our parents always said we were destined to get married and even as kids, Calvin would always say I'd be the one he'd get married to. High school, we grew apart. There was no bad blood, we just had different interests and I was an unattractive nerd while he was star of the football team as cliché as it sounds. We'd still see each other on occasion through holiday parties and neighborhood dinners. 

Now we're 30. I feel much better about myself and have found success in my single life. Calvin then announced he was engaged a year ago to JJ. There was a holiday party with our families again and my parents went (I was out of town). Apparently both families and Calvin mentioned me when sharing his baby photos and that they always thought it would be us engaged. It didn't seem to be in a bad way, just kind of a joke. According to my mom, afterwards, JJ seemed to be really intimidated by me and the past. 

Apparently the families are still hanging onto the idea that I still wanted to marry Calvin. Sure, I was a tiny bit disappointed but it was like letting go of a childhood crush on Peter Pan, I'm not heartbroken about it and don't feel like anything was taken from me. 

Move on to JJ. She found me on facebook and contacted me saying that she would appreciate if I didn't go to the wedding because she saw me as an 'ex' despite us never having a relationship. I left it on read and went anyway to support my friend and he was thankful I was there. Wished them well at the dinner table and went back to minding my own business and chatting with the other neighbors, Calvin's family, etc. 

JJ reached out to me again and told me she was really disappointed in me and that me being there ruined her image of having a perfect wedding. I haven't shared this with anyone and don't think I will. I don't feel close enough to Calvin anymore to put a damper on his relationship. She seemed nice enough from what everyone's said, so that had me thinking if I really did ruin her wedding by being an AH and showing up anyway.

17qxw6f,AITA for giving my adult daughter money to make up for missing out on her senior trip?,"I have three kids we'll call Brock (24M), Misty (21F), and Ash (19F).

Misty graduated from high school in 2020.  Due to world events, her senior year was spent at home.  Things like her senior trip, spring break, and prom got cancelled.  Her school never planned a ""make up"" trip or prom for her year and instead went back to business for the class of 2021. 

Misty, props to her, never complained about it.  She accepted things with a sense of resignation, if that makes sense.  Regardless, I can see that it hurt her to see her brother and sister get to do the things she couldn't do.

A few weeks ago, Misty reached out and asked if I can help her out with something.  Her favorite actor is going to be performing on Broadway next spring and she desperately wants to see that show.  She's in college and has a job, but needs help paying for a ticket.    

She made it clear that I didn't have to pay her if I didn't want to.  But given what happened three years ago and how she took it, I felt bad for her.  What she went through wasn't fair.

So I bought Misty a ticket for opening night.  It was expensive, yes, but frankly it was about the same amount that was spent for Ash's prom or Brock's letterman jacket and banquet.  

My husband doesn't agree.  He thinks that I'm spoiling Misty.  He doesn't see how it's fair to give our adult daughter money for a trip but not do the same for the other kids.  To him, what happened in 2020 happened in 2020 and you can't do anything to fix it.  

I disagree.  Brock and Ash got to go on trips, banquets, and prom for their senior year and Misty spent hers under lockdown.  She really had nothing to commemorate senior year.  And if anything, the money I spent on her ticket came out to less than all of the senior year expenses for either of our other children.  

I need an outside perspective.  AITA?  Or is my husband in the wrong?

Edit:  it’s late.  I’m going to talk some sense into the dingus I married. I’ll update if possible.

My brother Chris (37M) and sister in law Rachel (33F) have two kids 4F and 2M. I’ve taken an extended maternity after my most recent delivery due to some complications and won’t be back at work until after the new year. My husband went back when our little one was 4 months. 

Chris and Rachel came to my husband and I about 2 months ago saying their daycare could no longer keep them as the center was closing unexpectedly and they were in a bind and asked if I could watch the kids while they worked. I told them I would be willing to so long as it was temporary and not long term. Both assured me they were seeking out a new center that could take them both. Both were appreciative of our help as they were told on a Wednesday the center’s last day of operation would be that same Friday.

The first few weeks were fine but as it’s been longer and longer, my husband and I are staring to doubt they are actually looking for a new center. They’ve never offered to pay me for watching the kids, but I’ve never asked either. Until this past weekend. We took all the kids to a park on Saturday and I spoke with my brother about whether or jot they had found a mew daycare. He said they had done some tours but were told there weren’t spaces for the kids yet and had been wait listed. I told him I completely understood and reminded him me keeping the kids was supposed to be temporary. I asked him if he and Rachel could start paying me $100/week for both kids. He called me outrageous for even asking citing “we’re family.” 

I tried explaining how much more money my husband and I were spending having them in the house 5 days a week and he called me lazy for still being on leave when my baby is 8 months old. At this point, I told him I would no longer be watching the kids and not to bring them Monday (yesterday) morning.

181ltdb,AITA for doing what my wife told me to yet she claims I threw her under the bus?,"Simple story - happened yesterday.

We have a 7 month old baby that is watched by a nanny most days but on some days, my parent's come over during the day to help out. Yesterday was a busy work morning as I essentially had to run out for a few meetings just as they arrived so I handed off the baby and gave them a quick status update. Wife is upstairs at home sitting on Zoom meetings.

I get a text mid-morning from my wife saying that she's hearing the baby fuss excessively for over 20 mins and for me to call my parents to suggest that the baby may just need a bit more food. I do just that - I call mom and say that my wife hears the baby fussing and that he's probably hungry. Mom says that dad was already prepping a bottle and that the baby was fussing just for a few minutes since they came back inside. Mom asks why my wife didn't come downstairs to say anything or check up if she was concerned and I just tell her that she's in a work meeting. I carry on with my meetings and carry on with my day. Nanny switched parent's off later on that day per schedule.

In the evening, wife asks me what I told my parents - I told her that I conveyed what she told me. ""Wife says baby is fussing, he's probably hungry, probably a good time to make a bottle, she's in a meeting and can't come down to check up."" That made wife very upset, says I threw her under the bus and made her seem insensitive and inattentive. My response was simply - ""But I did what you told me to...""

17yin8d,AITA for not telling my brother I got engaged over a year ago?,"So, this is obviously a thorwaway, also I am dyslexic, so tell me if I need to fix anything please.

I(29F) have an older brother (32M), we were raised by a single mother, and don't have any extended family, so we grew up pretty close.

I moved across the country 11 years ago to attend college, then stayed in the new state because it has better job opportunities for my field. My brother, on the other hand, remained close to my mother.

8 years ago he introduced his girlfriend to us over Christmas, and also told us that he got engaged. She asked me to be a bridesmaid and I accepted, but when she told me that their wedding date will be close to my finals, I warned her that I might not be able to do everything she needs me to do. She was very sweet, and said that that's ok, she just wanted me to be involved.

3 months before the wedding, my brother called me, he said that my ""lack of involvement and enthusiasm for being a bridesmaid"" was stressing his fiancée, and that they decided that I should just be a normal guest. I said that that was fine, apologized to him, then called her to apologize too.

Fast foreward to when they finalized the seating chart, and apparently I was seated in a back table, with some of my brother's coworkers, not even close to the family table. I was upset when mom told me, but didn't want to make a scene. My mom on the other hand demamnded they change my seat, which resulted in me being uninvited. I renember my brother telling me that his wife deserved the wedding of her dream, and that I was ""stressing her"". I asked my mom to back off, didn't go, but still sent a congratulations text and a gift. 

But I also stopped reaching out to my brother, and it became obvious that I was the only one keeping us in contact. We rarely met after that, mainly because they spend holidays with his in-laws, and then COVID hit.

I met a man during COVID, we hit it off, it became serious, and he proposed last year. I asked my mom to only tell my brother if he asked about me, and she respected my wishes. Also I don't have social media at all, so there was no announcement or anything like that.

We just sent out invites, and my brother got his, and for the first time in years, he called me upset, because I didn't tell him that I had a serious partner, let alone a fiancé.

I let him rant and rave, then just told him that it was not a secret, and if he bothered to ask me or my mom about my life, we would have told him. He said that I should have reached out to tell him, but I said that I did not want to stress him or his wife with my presence.

He called me an AH, and said they would not attend, to which I said ""it's your choice"", which made him even angrier, so AITA?",Charming-Corner-6235,3281,311,0.9700000286102296,0.2124349138371493,1700348605,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yin8d/aita_for_not_telling_my_brother_i_got_engaged/,2023,11,AmItheAsshole,2023-11-18 23:03:25
17q8foj,AITA for reporting my kid's teacher for being stupid?,"I got a call from my son's school on Thursday that he was being taken to the ER. His PE class was playing baseball and he got hit in the face with a ball and got knocked out. 

Fortunately the ball was a soft foamy texture. He had CT, MRI, and a host of other exams. They diagnosed him with a slight concussion and had a gnarly black eye and abrasions on his cheek. 

He was cleared to go back to school and looked a little fucked up. Everyone knew what happened and some of his teachers emailed us to see how he was doing. We emailed them to keep an eye on him.

Today my son came home and said his teacher asked what happened to his face. He was confused. Like everyone knew. He's a 6th grader and even the 7th and 8th graders and their teachers knew. The fucking ambulance came to the school.

His teacher held him at lunch  today. Ms. D said he could tell her the truth because his face didn't look like a baseball hit it but ""someone"" did. He said no, it was a baseball. She asked how he was being treated at home. He said fine. She said she didn't believe his story and would have to tell the principal. My son said okay.

When my son told me this, I started to laugh. No way is his teacher this fucking dumb. Well, sure enough I get an email a couple of hours later from the VP saying a staff member submitted a report that they were suspicious of my son's face. The VP assured the staff that it was from an injury at school. Like everyone knew.

I was so mad that I emailed Ms. D and told her I knew she submitted this report trying to start shit. How could she be that fucking stupid? She knew about the accident but she didn't think a baseball to the face would leave a blackeye. This caused all of us so much needless stress. I think she was trying to get brownie points and look busy. 

I also replied to the VP that my son now has extreme anxiety going back to her class and we're worried that he'll start experiencing headaches from being stressed out over his dumbass teacher. This could had gone real bad. He replied that he was taking this seriously and she won't be in my son's 3rd period class tomorrow.

17nyame,AITA for saying what I said to my sister because her and my wife are leaving me out of their trip and expecting me to pay the bills when they are gone,"
I (29m) and my wife (27f) moved into my sister's (31f) house about 8 months ago when I lost my job, against my will. My wife decided that we couldn't afford our life anymore despite her making a sizeable income and accepted my sister's invitation to move in, and has been spilting the bills with my sister since. Even though we are only two people and she has her children (3m and 6f) in the house as well so should be paying for 3 peoples portions, which I've mentioned several times.

  Yesterday they told me that in December they are going on vacation for two weeks. My wife, my sister, my sister's kids, and my sister's boyfriend.  When I questioned why I wasn't invited my sister rolled her eyes (passive aggressive as always) and my wife said that since I didn't have a form of income that I wouldn't be able to afford it, but they know that if I had enough time in advance I could've lent money from my mother, which is why I suspect they hadn't told me sooner but they say they just decided.

   I told them that it was completely unfair to go on a trip now that I have no money and never before when I could've come too. My sister loudly, i assume to embarrass me (this was in the front yard), implied I wasnt trying hard enough to get a job even though I have been trying and even louder told me not to go begging to mom. My mother doesn't mind lending me money she usually says don't even worry about it,  and I think they left it to now because she doesn't make a lot so if I need to borrow that much i need to let her now a couple months in advance.
  
  I asked my wife if I could get some help from her if I could get the plane ticket covered by my mother, and she insisted she couldn't despite her large savings account (it was over 10k last year) so now I'm thinking they just don't want me there and I got upset and here's where I may be the asshole I said maybe if she wasn't covering half the bills while my sister is not paying appropriately for her children's power and water usage she'd have the extra.

  My sister blew up and screamed at me for what was probably minutes, calling me a loser and a bum and many other hurtful things and said that if angry about whos using what i can pay the bills for the 2 weeks they are gone, despite me obviously not having the income to. My wife said I was out of line, and i do feel as if I may have somewhat overreacted but AITA",Quirky_Upstairs_3731,2279,864,0.7900000214576721,0.1951618375761674,1699139563,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nyame/aita_for_saying_what_i_said_to_my_sister_because/,2023,11,AmItheAsshole,2023-11-04 23:12:43
17twd4x,AITA for crying after I didn't like what I got for my birthday?,"It was my (16M) birthday yesterday and I was opening the gifts that my parents had bought me. 

I've never been interested in sports I find it really boring. I like painting and art way more and my parents know that. Almost every birthday they give me sport related gifts, footballs, some team merch, etc. I don't even know what some of it is because I couldn't give a shit about sports.

I asked my parents to get me a specific set of pens for my birthday, I've wanted them for ages.

I opened my present and every single one of them was sport related. I just sat there and started crying in front of them. I didn't mean to cry it was embarrassing but I feel like they never listen to me. They've spent all of this money on expensive gifts that they know I hate and will never use. I told them this and they accused me of being ungrateful and said that I've ruined the day.

They sent me to my room and I haven't really spoken to them since.

At a small cafe/restaurant while spouse and I ordered things at different counters for a quick dine-in bite, someone else placed a bag on the last open table, “claimed” the table as his and went somewhere else. 
When I was done with placing my order, I came and sat myself on the “claimed” seats since no one was physically sitting there except a lonely shopping bag on top of the table. 
Then my spouse came, sat himself and we started chatting while waiting for our food to be served.

This guy who had “claimed” the table earlier, came and angrily told me that he was sitting there, even though no one was sitting there except the shopping bag. I told him off by saying, “I didn’t see anyone sitting here. Besides, this is an open cafe not a DTDC bus where you get to claim a table by placing your belongings on it.”

Had he asked to share the table, I wouldn’t have mind it. But the tone he used, pissed me off.

184nwuy,AITA for having our neighbor move their fence off our property,"Throwaway. My son helped me create an account to post this AITA.

A neighbor hired a contractor to build a wood privacy fence.  I came home after the posts were set and immediately suspected the fence posts were on my property.  We live in brand new homes and so I asked her to meet me outside with her survey.  I had already staked out the property line, and it was clear to see the posts were on my property.

 Before I could say a word, she said ‘you can’t tell where to put a fence with a survey’ which astounded me and left me shaking my head.  After a few minutes of trying to explain that a survey is absolutely the way to determine where your fence should be, she threw her hands up and said ‘my contractor has my survey’ and walked back in the house.  

The next week, the contractor continued to finish the fence without moving anything.  We emailed her and called her and she ghosted us.  I paid $900 to have a surveyor do a site visit and write a report that clearly showed the fence was on our property.  We sent that to her from our lawyer and she finally responded ‘there must be some mistake’.  Only after more legal threats did she get her contractor back to move it off our property.  

Meanwhile she trash talked us to everyone she could and labeled us bullies etc and has half our new neighborhood believing her.  She won’t talk to us, which is actually fine by us, but it really pisses us off knowing she has created this negative impression about us. 

 I should mention that our lots are pretty small and we had a very large backyard project done this summer and the fence was taking up valuable real estate that we needed to fit our plunge pool in.  We tried to deal with this in a polite neighborly way and she forced us to bring in our lawyer. So, AITA?

**edited to add relevant information: in the survey I paid for, the fence was measured at 12 inches into my property line. Not an insignificant amount if you ask me!** ",AITAthrowawayFence,2662,324,0.9700000286102296,0.1776220117537231,1701040264,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184nwuy/aita_for_having_our_neighbor_move_their_fence_off/,2023,11,AmItheAsshole,2023-11-26 23:11:04
17pfiz6,AITA for using a disabled bathroom without a physical disability?,"I (f16) was studying in my local leisure centre while my sister and dad were swimming, and instead of going into the regular bathroom I went into the unlocked disabled one, it isn't one that needs a key, I've been diagnosed with tourettes for about 8 years now, and I feel uncomfortable in the regular bathrooms because I get loads of weird looks and just kind of like ""what the fuck is wrong with her"" kind of whispers behind my back from girls my age

I didn't see a problem however whenever I left a woman (about 30 or so) started telling me off, saying that I was ""a disgusting ableist for using the disabled bathroom without a disability"" I tried to explain that tourettes was a disability but she wasn't hearing it, I told her if she needed to use the bathroom she could and I was sorry if I inconvinenced her, but she told me that she didn't need the disabled bathroom because she ""wasn't disabled and didn't want to take those resources like I did""

I ended up walking away but she got a member of staff and the staff member asked for my proof of diagnosis, I didn't carry it with me and I explained that, the member of staff ended up telling me off and not to use the bathroom, and any time I ticked throughout this, she'd point at me and go ""she's doing it again!!"" 

But now I'm not sure whether I made the right choice in using the disabled bathroom for my own comfort without a physical disability

17mfxd9,AITA for not letting my family take what they want?,"Me and wife are moving to another country. Instead of selling our stuff, we decided to gift it to our families because it will improve their lives. Most of our stuff is high end compared to what either of our parents have. 

First we thought about what they needed so we gave them that. Study table for her sister, washing machine for her mom, an AC for my mom, fridge for my parents house, etc. Then I invited my parents and hers on separate days to ask what they’d like to have and make a list for us. The lists came out that everybody wanted everything. 

Then we made our decision together and told them who gets what which of course isn’t ideal for either party. 

Now both my parents and hers are appealing to emotional side of us, telling each of us how the other one is facilitating their family more. They also claim they are not materialistic but the other family is. At the end of it, both sides are unhappy and both sides are blaming me for inequitable division. Her family thinks I took advantage of her and didn’t value her efforts. My family thinks my in-laws are materialistic and taking my hard earned money and things for granted.

17rpk5j,AITA for telling my friend we don’t care about pics of her cats right now?,"I (29m) am going on an early group “Friendsgiving” trip to Colorado in five days. All together there are five of us going but the one person I may have been an AH to is Sarah (28f). We have a group chat where we discuss planning for the trip and we all agreed to keep this chat exclusive to trip info so we don’t have important info being buried by random conversations. Two days ago we found out our Air BNB was canceled due to snow damage breaking a hole in the ceiling and we’d been scrambling to find a new place to stay. We couldn’t find another Air BNB so we settled for two, joining, rooms at a hotel that Sarah managed to find a deal for. We asked Sarah to text us the info for the hotel and she said she would, five minutes go by and instead of the hotel info we get a bunch of pictures of her two cats as well as a video with the caption “My two widdle fur babies are so precious, I’m gonna miss them so much.” Another friend reminded her to keep the chat relevant to trip info and asked again for the hotel information. Sarah replied with “Well screw me for missing my cats.”

Here’s where I may be the AH; I replied with “Sarah I’m sorry but we don’t care about your cats right now, when we’re trying to put our trip back together, can you please send the hotel info?” She sent the info and tagged it with a “F*ck you” to which she’s received heat from everyone who will be attending the trip. She has since apologized but I feel like my comment has put a damper on the vacation before it’s even started, AITAH for saying what I did?

Edit to add: All five of us were looking in to new hotels or Air BNBs, Sarah just happened to be the first one to find a good deal on something that we all agreed on, she wasn’t the only one looking.

Edit 2: To answer the question I’ve been seeing asked; why was it so urgent we get the information if we had five days. I apologize but I misspoke in the post. Sarah hadn’t actually booked it, she found a deal for it on one of those booking sites and we needed her to send it so the guy handling finances could pay for it.",AITAH_Viewer,2444,251,0.9200000166893004,0.15966230943737,1699570644,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rpk5j/aita_for_telling_my_friend_we_dont_care_about/,2023,11,AmItheAsshole,2023-11-09 22:57:24
17qx9vr,AITA for holding my husband to the same standards he holds others too?,"I (F31) have been with my husband (M37) for 4 years.  He is constantly complaining about my two kids and how they always do the bear minimum when it comes to chores. But never says anything to his son about his chore being done minimal. For example he was complaining to me about my daughter's (F13) clothes still being in a basket in her room but has said nothing to his son (M14) about the clothes that are all over his room and not even in a basket. He also complains my daughter is on her phone to much mean while his son is on the Xbox from the time he gets off school (he is in a video game club at school and stays after twice a week to play games but even on the days he don't stay he comes home and jumps on) until it is tome to shower which he has to be told to do. Mean while I work a full time job and deal with all the finances and he is a stay at home dad. I then come home and have to finish the dishes that are not done and sort through the laundry that he has washed that day and give the kids theirs then fold the towels and my own clothes. ( I refuse to put my husband's clothes away and they sit in a basket in our room). So I finally tell him ""look until you can tell your son to do all his stuff properly and make sure his stuff is done properly don't tell me my kids are lazy and don't do what they are supposed to do. Also until you as an adult can put your clothes away don't complain about my kids clothes. For me here is the real kicker. I tell my kids daily what chores they need to do and if they are not done they get grounded. I also tell my step son what chores he needs to do and when they are not done I try to ground him and then get told ""no I'll have a talk with him it will get done"" and it don't get done.

17t71hr,AITA for refusing to host an all-vegan Hanukkah?,"My partner David and I are in an interfaith relationship and host both Hanukkah and Christmas every year. We enjoy hosting and especially cooking, and have zero problem catering to people's dietary needs. A few members of my family keep kosher and my cousin Ruth is vegan – all of them get a full meal (main, three sides, dessert) and drinks just like those without dietary restrictions at all of our holiday celebrations.  

My cousin offered to host Hanukkah at her house this year, which of course meant an all-vegan menu. The vast majority of the family said that they would prefer to have our normal arrangement at our house, as they were not interested in celebrating a holiday with a vegan menu, as they'd be missing out on many traditional family foods and recipes – many of which have been in our family before the Shoah. 

Ruth then came to us and asked if we'd be willing to cook an all-vegan Hanukkah, especially as we're both good cooks and she was sure that people would come round to the vegan dishes we made if they gave them a try. My partner and I politely declined, but asked her if there was anything we could do, prepare, or cook to make her feel more welcome. She said a lot of very hurtful things in response and has not spoken to us since.

17t7jpd,AITA for refusing to thank my MIL for a gift card she sent my husband and I for Christmas?,"My(41F) husband's(43M) parents live a few states away from us and we only see them maybe once a year. They are extremely well-off ... not that that matters,  but I figured I'd mention it. We both work full-time jobs, but there have been times when we have struggled financially. A time or two my husband has asked his mom for help paying a bill,  and she has reluctantly helped us. While I am extremely grateful  for her help, and have expressed my gratitude wholeheartedly..she's the type of person who will never ever let you forget about every cent she's ever helped out with.  She would constantly bring it up, and  it just kind of felt demeaning in a way. Especially because I  HATE asking anyone for help, but these were times when it was a last resort.

Fast forward to a couple Christmases ago, she mailed us a $200 gift card for Christmas. I work retail and Christmas is kind of a crazy time of year for me. I work late nights and long hours. When the card arrived I was at work, and my husband FaceTimed his mom with our kids to thank her for the gift. I intended on personally thanking her, but I just got busy and forgot.

A couple weeks of my life consisting of  basically just working and sleeping go by, and my husband mentioned that his mother hadn't called him in a while. He ended up calling her to make sure everything was okay and she WENT OFF.

She asked my husband why I hadn't thanked her for the gift card. He told her that when he thanked her, he was thanking her on my behalf as well, and that I've been working a lot.

She said it was unacceptable, and that I needed to thank her, because, to her I looked ungrateful.

When he told me that his mom was angry and that I should just thank her I flat out refused. Not because I wasn't grateful, but because she made such a huge deal about   it. She obviously only sent it as another thing to throw in our faces, and not out of the kindness of her heart. 

Since my husband defended me, and I never thanked her, she blocked both of us on social media and hasn't attempted to contact us or her grandchildren in years. 

My husband knows she's ridiculous for  taking it that far, but every once in a while he'll say something like ""you know,  you could have just sucked it up and thanked her"".

On the other hand, her brother has a job and position where he can come and go as he please so he helped with our children. The three of us took turns taking the kids to school and picking them up. The kids sometimes stayed with him for a day or two. When they grew older, our work schedules stabilized so we didn’t rely on him as much. However, the kids are incredibly attached to their uncle to the point it seems like I’m being replaced.

Once when our daughter ran out of panty liners, she called her uncle to ask him to pick her up some. My wife was at work but I was working in the yard and she didn’t think to ask me. A year ago our son was questioning his sexual identity and instead of coming to me or his mother, he went to talk to his uncle and then my BIL told my wife about their conversation. I was the last to know about it. On our daughter’s last birthday, she was most excited about his gift because he got her the exact model and color tennis racket she wanted. She didn’t take a second look at my present. The last straw happened earlier today when our son was sick at school.

Instead of calling me or his mother, he called his uncle. BIL texted us about the situation and asked my wife to call the school so that he could pick up our son. I was home and no one asked me to do it. I was very angry when BIL dropped our son off. I confronted him about over stepping our family boundaries and we got into an argument. I told him to leave our house and leave our children alone. My wife just got home from work and we got into an argument. She doesn’t like the way I talked to her brother but I don’t like the way I’m being left out of my children’s life. She said we’re lucky to have him help us out but I don’t want his help anymore.

I confronted my dad about upsetting my kids and he said it was my fault for not setting boundaries. My mom chimed in to say that no real lady wants to be called baby, much less by her own kids.

My son joined in, dressing up his stuffies. It was so cute that I took a pick and put it on FB. Also, while researching her I found out my doll is a Just Like You #11 which are a bit rare & go for $100+-$300+ online. always fun to find valuable things at the thrift store for cheap!

Fast forward- today, a few days after Black Friday I got tagged in a friend of a friend's post. ""Kay"" is asking if anyone has an AG doll to sell. She had tried to buy one online for Black Friday but couldn't find anything within her price range. I instantly had Kay in my DMs offering me $50 for my doll. I declined.  telling her that I don't know why my friend tagged me cuz my doll isn't for sale. 

She replied about how she had promised her 6yr old granddaughter ""Mia"" a doll for Xmas. She was now worried if she ordered a more expensive doll online it wouldn't get to her in time & offered me $70. I again declined & said my doll was something I had wanted at Xmas as a kid & waited a long time for.

Kay immediately countered. ""See you know what it's like not getting the AG you wanted so badly. Please! You could make this Xmas so special for Mia! You can use the money to get a brand new one!""

I thought about it. I really did but I told her no thanks. Finding mine at the thrift shop felt special- like it was meant to be. I suggested if she was worried about the doll not getting to her in time she could get one of the much cheaper AG knockoff Walmart dolls & have it ready just in case & return it if the AG doll makes it in time.

Kay didn't want to get a cheap doll. She then switched tactics. Asking me if I would even be able to look at my doll again knowing that not selling her meant I ruined Xmas for a little 6yr old girl?

Yes I can Kay because when you decide to be manipulative is where I draw the line. I immediately blocked her. maybe this makes me the a-hole but I don't really care. I'm sorry little Mia.

184oall,"AITA for going against my boyfriend's ""family rules""?","I've been dating Marc for the past six months and he's been a nice guy so far. Has all the qualities I would want in a partner. He's nice, kind, an amazing cook. We do everything together and have never had problems in our relationship thus far. 

Marc took me to meet his family for the first time ever two days ago. My period was a day or two late this month so I wasn't surprised when I started menstruating in the middle of playing with Marc's neices. I didn't think much of it and told Marc's mom (who was playing with the neices alongside me) that I needed to use the bathroom since I've gotten my period. I was not expecting to see disgust on her face. 

She looked really panicked and disgusted when she stood up to lead me to the bathroom. The whole time, she kept telling me not to touch anything or anyone, and to maintain a safe distance from the food on the dinner table. It was bizzare to me but I kept my mouth shut until I could get a tampon inside me. 

When I came out, I noticed that Marc's mom seemed wary of me. I asked her if everything was okay and she said that everything was fine but that I couldn't touch certain things in the house, especially the items made out of cloth. This included the couch. I had to sit on a random wooden chair. I would not have minded if not for the context. 

This whole situation made me extremely mad as she was treating me like I was impure and untouchable. The other women in the house did not say anything and the men pretended to not hear the commotion. I told Marc's mom clearly that I was not going to be following these rules and would much rather prefer to be out of the house. 

Marc had gone out to get ice creams for everyone so I did not get the chance to tell him before I stormed out and went back home by cab. He wasn't upset with me but he did say that I could've waited for him to come back even though it wasn't completely necessary. 

My sister in law says it was kind of an asshole move to just up and leave. I could've dealt with it for one, for Marc's sake. But I'm torn.

181mnhy,AITA for bringing up my aunt's ex-husband after she kept pushing me to get married?,"My (32F) aunt (55F) is one of those nosy ladies you'd think only exists in romcoms. When I was a teen she asked me when I’d get a boyfriend, when I was in a steady relationship she asked me when I was getting married, and the marriage inquisition became even more invasive after my younger sister (28F) got married this month – which probably gave my aunt probable cause to label me as the family's “spinster”. 

In the wedding party, she kept asking me why I had broken up with my ex-boyfriend, she said how she always thought we’d ended up married soon, and she advised me to get serious about this if I ever plan to have kids, because I’m not getting any younger. It came to a point where I couldn’t keep my mouth shut anymore. Granted, I could have just asked her to stay out of my business, but since she was bringing up things about my personal life, I assumed it was fair to do the same. 

So I said something like: “even getting married is not a guarantee you’d be with someone forever, look at you and Uncle X, I’m sure you thought it would be eternal love yet now he’s with someone else”. It was the same as slapping her in the face; she accused me of being disrespectful and left the table on the verge of tears. My mother (her sister) came to ask me what I had said, because my aunt was crying in the bathroom, and she told me to go after her and apologize. I refused.

183waoi,AITA for refusing to go the fanily dinner?,"Me (30f) and my twin brother live in different cities. Before last Christmas, I was speaking about gifts woth my brother and he was unsure what gift to get his wife (30f). During this conversation, I mentioned that I got her a book she really liked in a library when they came over on a previous visit. He asked if I he could pay me to have the gift for her, and I would get her something else. I agreed. But since the next day I was travelling to their house for the Christmas dinner, I got her a last minute bath set.

During the gift exchange, she absolutely loved the book from my brother, and was polite about my gift. However, later during the evening she mentioned how she ""understands when money is tight"" and that I ""could get more thoughtful gifts next time"". It did not feel good. Then we travelled back home and never spoke about this again.

Today, I am speaking to my brother on the phone and discuss about Christmas gifts. I tell him that for my sister in law, my gift is a wool sweater that she specifically mentioned she liked a while ago. My brother asks again that I let him give this gift to her and that I get her something else.

I said no, especially after last year. He had no idea that my sister in law made any comments and said that maybe I interpreted wrongly. The he said he actually remembers my sister in law speaking privately with him afterwards and saying that gifts are a reflection of love and that I clearly don't put much thought in her gifts. I asked him to just get her something else because I put thought in my gift, and have no idea what to get her otherwise. After some back and forth I agreed to let him have the gift, but I told him I am not coming for dinner this year as I don't want to hear any more comments. He said that I am a baby, and to think about it.

I am quite upset that he does this thing of asking for my gift. I also don't put that much pressure on myself when it comes to gifts, but I make an exception with my sister in law as she often discusses the gifts she normally gets.

Everyone seemed really friendly, and we were just doing introductions when this one guy, ""Dee,"" introduced himself and volunteered that he was Haitian. So I responded in French ""Let's speak in French! How long have you lived in the United States?""

17q6i3h,AITA for not wanting my MIL to fly over to visit when my baby is born?,"My MIL has no job, no savings, no husband, and lives in a different country. She divorced my FIL when my husband was a kid and have only remained in touch via Facebook. When she heard my husband and I were getting married she started messaging my husband more and more often and was telling him everyday how he is her favorite son (my husband has several half siblings -same mother different fathers). My husband paid for her trip to our wedding because she allegedly told him that her money was “tied up” at the time. 

Fast forward to now, we are expecting a baby in the new year. When she heard the news she immediately told my husband that she’s going to visit us to take care of the baby. When I heard my anxiety just went through the roof. 

1. I don’t want “help” from her. If anything I would rather have my mom here - I have no plans on entertaining this woman while I am recovering from child birth and learning to be a first time mom, especially when my husband has decided not to take any paternity leave 
2. She will somehow need us to pay for her trip here AND the food while she’s here - my husband and I are already worried about living on a single income while I am on leave 
3. I have a gut feeling that once she is here, she will never leave and we will be stuck

17n86pq,AITA for telling my husband to back off about me getting more active?,"Over the past couple of months, my (37F) husband (39M) has been losing weight. I'm really happy for him. He has high blood pressure and he's morbidly obese. I've been cooking healthier for the family as a whole and making sure he has salad ingredients every week for his lunches. 
I am also morbidly obese. I'm making healthier choices, vastly decreased my fast food and treat intake, and am making a conscious effort to take the kids outside more. 
We live in a 3rd floor apartment and a week or two ago, he mentioned something while we were walking up about how I needed to get more exercise. I guess I wasn't walking up as fast as he wanted or he heard me breathing hard. Whatever. I agreed with him. 
A few days ago, we were discussing daily life and he asked what I do when I take the kids to the playground. I told him that I play with the kids a few minutes, sit on my phone a few minutes, walk around playing Pokemon Go, sit for a few more minutes, etc. He said I needed to start walking more. I just said, ""okay."" Because it honestly rubbed me the wrong way. Like what I was doing wasn't enough. 
Today, him and I were at a local park and I was scrolling through FB videos and stopped on a video of a larger woman working out. It was a before/after type video. He looked over my shoulder and said, ""yeah, like that!"", pointing at the video. I'm responded, ""what?"" He said i could be doing that. 
I (calmly) told him that he needed to stop harping on me about my weight. I guess technically he's only harping on my exercise frequency. He said, ""I don't!"" I told him, ""yes. You have brought it up 3 or 4 times."" My tone was conversational, but I truly did want him to stop. He started to say ""no I haven't"", but one of our kids ran up and I turned to the kid. Then he muttered under his breathe ""fuck this."", got up and sat in the car. 
I honestly don't want to deal with this. I don't want to make a big deal about it, but I want his comments to stop.

UPDATE: I was asking if ITAH for what I said.  So far, no one has said I'm the AH for that. Just that I'm the AH for existing in a fat body. I know I'm a fat fuck, but I want to know if I'm the AH for what I said. 

For some context, I'm not at the highest weight I've ever been at. I've lost 50+lbs at least 4 times in my life. But it has ultimately always been unsustainable. Which is why I'm taking a ""slow but steady"" approach this time. I'll do what works for now and when that doesn't seem so arduous, I'll add something new.  The one time I lost a substantial amount of weight while living with my husband was between my two pregnancies. He was not losing weight at the time and would bring me desserts, sodas, etc after I'd ask him not to. We had to have a full out fight about it before he got the message that I don't want those things. Yes, I'll eat them, but I didn't buy them because I didn't want them in the house because I'll eat them! 

Also, I'm autistic and communication is not my strong point. I tend to just be quietly annoyed until I blow up. So I thought I was doing well by calmly telling him that I don't appreciate the comments about my exercise level and I want them to stop. I understand now that there is no way for him to bring up these concerns that won't annoy me, and that's a me issue, but him. Also, I just made the connection between his comments and all the comments my mom would make when I was a kid and she wanted to push me to lose weight/ eat less/ not eat sweets/ exercise.

18cgr86,AITA for expressing to my in-laws that I don't want to be their server for their family's Christmas dinner?,"So, I'm a newlywed, and my in-laws are rolling into town for Christmas and staying my husband's and my new house. They mentioned wanting to dine out for Christmas dinner, but I offered to whip up a home-cooked feast instead. Unfortunately, they turned down the offer.  
Now, here's where it gets interesting. I am currently working as a server in our town after recently being laid off from my corporate job. Lucky for me, the restaurant is closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas.  
Well, turns out my mother-in-law had other plans. She called up my workplace without speaking to me beforehand and asked for me to be their server for their entire Christmas dinner. I found out through my husband that I'd be playing the role of their server for their festive family celebration, and my Christmas ""gift"" would be a sweet tip and takeout from my restaurant.  
Seems a bit odd, especially since our restaurant isn't even open on Christmas Eve or Christmas and I'd be available to spend time with them on those days. They're scheduling this dinner the day before we close and making it their designated family celebration. 

I politely declined because, let's be real, being excluded from Christmas dinner while working as their server? That's a hard pass from me.

Jasmin and I aren't that close but we're friendly to each other.   
  
She got pregnant a few months ago and she had her gender reveal party about 2 weeks ago. Everyone was so excited and happy when we found out she was having a girl.  
  
During this year's family Christmas dinner, she announced that she was going to name her kid Madelyn, but spelt differently of course! (as if that made it any better) Her daughter's name was going to be Madilyn. I was completely shocked. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect that Jasmin would want to name her kid Madelyn as well. If she told me before we named our daughter, I probably would've taken that into consideration before naming her.  
  
I asked Jasmin why she would want to name her daughter the same name as mine, and she said that technically it wasn't the same name since it was going to be spelt different. She also said that her great aunt's name was also Madilyn and that she thought that Madilyn was a cute name. Jasmin also mentioned that Madilyn was supposed to be the name of her kid before she had a miscarriage (this was before Madelyn was born). I never even knew that was what she wanted to name her kid because she never told anyone!  
  
I was really upset and told her she could've just told me before I named my daughter that she also wanted to name her daughter Madelyn. She said that I was always such a witch and that I probably would've named my daughter Madelyn either way. I don't even know what I ever did to this woman. I then asked what we were going to do about the confusion of them having the same name and she told me we could use my daughter's middle name! Like, what? I told her if anything, we should be calling her daughter by her middle name since my daughter came first.   
  
We went back and forth a few more times before I decided to leave early with my husband and Madelyn. My daughter was also pretty confused and asked why her aunt would want to name her daughter the same name as her. I'm still really upset and hopes she changes her mind, but this morning my BIL texted me and said that I should try to better understand Jasmin and her feelings.

18gy5rr,AITA for not passing on an “heirloom” to my daughter in law?,"I am 48F and my eldest is 22M. He’s been with his fiancée (DIL) since they were 20 and he wants to marry her.

I’d always liked her before now, she’s a smart girl, she fits in well with the family, she’s driven, and she makes my son happy. Everything was all roses until they got engaged.

Now since I was little I was fascinated with jewellery. When I was older and married and had my own income I started to collect rings.

I would “design” them myself, used to ask friends and family to give me cash I could put towards them, and save up my disposable income towards whatever ring I wanted.

*Edit 2: Okay apparently this above paragraph is controversial. It is the custom of my family since always to give cash in celebrations. It’s also very normal in my community to ask your friends to give cash - I have done this myself for my friends.*

*HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF EACH PIECE OF JEWELLERY WAS ALWAYS BORNE BY ME. Whatever I got from birthdays was a bonus top up - not something I relied on to be able to afford it.*

It would be less than 10% of each piece definitely not the bulk. 10% being the highest but mostly it was around the 3-4% mark if any.

*Sorry but quite a few comments are being derailed by this*

I wasn’t buying one every year but over time I have a nice collection of rings. My favourite are a sapphire with a halo of diamonds, an emerald in a trilogy with 1ct diamonds either side, and a Ruby set in a pavé band.

After son got engaged and we invited him and DIL to dinner at home, DIL asked to speak to me. She said she’s been seeing my emerald ring over the years and she has always wanted one.

She pointed out that I wear it least often, which is true, and demanded that I gift it to her as an heirloom engagement ring. This is in addition to other wedding gifts and expenses we had discussed as a family during dinner. This includes gold to the value of approximately £6000 which is honestly more than my entire wedding cost, and which I still think is a significant amount.

This rubbed me the wrong way and I admit I accused her of trying to pick through my estate before I’m even dead. I told her the ring is mine and I can even sell it on my deathbed if I want to; she has no right to expect it and she’s being a rude brat by demanding it.

She yelled at me that something like this can’t just be sold, it should be an heirloom and it’s normal for heirlooms to
Be passed on while the wearer is still alive.

I told her to leave if she was just in my home to demand my property and she stormed out, taking my son with her.

She’s mad at me and son says I should’ve just passed the ring to her since I have others and it would
Be a nice gesture to welcome her to the family! He says it’s no different than his sister occasionally borrowing some of my pieces.

My husband and my daughter are on my side but this is the first time my son has shut me out like this so AITA?

This is not a case of her being proposed to without a ring.)",Existing_Ring_,8427,2636,0.959999978542328,0.7091707118806563,1702419209,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gy5rr/aita_for_not_passing_on_an_heirloom_to_my/,2023,12,AmItheAsshole,2023-12-12 22:13:29

She was uncomfortable and asked what other songs they sing. He couldn't list any, but she asked for a list on Monday and got one. Theres a couple ""Jesus"" songs, basically. 

She was pretty upset when we sat down for dinner. I told her it was no big deal. He doesn't suddenly believe Jesus was the messiah because he sang about a shiny star. He's three.

She argued that its setting up a precedent, its worming into his subconscious. I told her she was being dramatic. Like half of his class is muslim and they are also taking part. It's just music.

She got pretty upset, said it was different and that she ""didn't expect"" me to get it. On Tuesday she spoke to the nursery nurses and told them she didn't want him to partake. They said they didn't have that option but she was free to take him out until after Christmas. 

She brought him home, to me, who works from home. I took him back. It's seriously not that serious. 

I told her she could take the time off work if she desperately doesn't want him there, but he already knows the songs so whats the point? Friday is his last day anyway.

She made a fuss this morning about having it noted in hia chart following that they need to make accommodation for him when celebrating religion. 

We've been fighting for a while over it. Everyone we know is evenly split - some think she's dramatic, some think I'm an asshole for making such a deal out of something that clearly means a lot to her.

18epys4,AITA for refusing to switch my son to an all vegan diet?,"I (22F) have a three year old with my ex (27M). When I found out I was pregnant we were together for two years and he had proposed two months before. It was public, we both posted about it. At first he was excited but when I was seven months he broke up with me and moved out. I asked if he was going to be involved and he said no and blocked me everywhere.


Our son is three now. Earlier this year he reached out to me saying hes matured and regrets not being in our sons life. I asked how hes matured and whats changed in the three years hes been no contact and he said that he has a new lifestyle and this and that. Come to find out hes married to a hardcore hippie vegan and living a completely different life. He lives on a farm now and has a lot of animals, none he makes profit off of. I was beyond shocked. He also doesnt smoke or drink and is just so… different. I spoke to my boyfriend, friends, and parents and they said to give him a chance.


He offered to start paying for his daycare and has been since May. I allowed him to meet my son in a supervised setting at the farm (I wanted to see the horses and animals lol) and met his wife. She inherited the farm and completely redesigned it. She was teaching me and my sisters about her raw organic vegan lifestyle and fed us a potato stew she made. It was really good and I thought things went well. They seemed trustable.


We’ve done a few more supervised visits throughout the year and I only now feel comfortable letting him stay overnights alone. They feed him vegan and I dont mind. The issue is they sat me down recently and asked that I start feeding him vegan full time since its much better for him and the world and that since he wants more involvement it makes sense he has a plantbased lifestyle. I said no, I myself am not vegan and they are not even the vegan chicken nuggets from Walmart type, they are the strictly raw fruits and vegetables type and thats asking me to learn a whole other type of cooking. They offered to meal prep during my time. He said in 2024 he wants 50/50 custody but that if I be “difficult” he will go for full custody siting our age and income difference and that I still live with my parents. I told him by threatening me he can see me in court and left. 


One of my sisters that came with me to a few of the visits has been vegetarian for many years now and she says Im being unreasonable since its healthier for him and they even offered to cook all his meals. And that by eating vegan for a while, it will mess up his digestive system if he eats meat and to just choose one and that since its a lifestyle for them and he will be involved in it, to just agree or Im the asshole?

18oqjjy,AITA for not buying my son a car like I did for the rest of his siblings.,"I (49M) have four kids, twin boys (both 27), one girl (25F) and another son (21M). This post is about my youngest son, Jack. Since they were children, I promised my kids two things, one, I’ll fully pay for all of their college expenses (housing/tuition/food etc) and two, once they graduate college, I will buy them a car. I kept that promise for all my kids, except with Jack and now I want to know if I am an asshole for that. I paid for Jack’s college expenses, but I am refusing to buy him a car, below is some of the reasons why:

1. I co signed my name on the lease for Jack’s room that he rents with a friend, and I send Jack his portion of the rent every month. The friend started taking advantage of my name being on the lease and stopped paying for rent too, knowing I will cover the amount because I don’t want missed payments on my credit score. I asked Jack multiple times to ask his roommate to pay his portion, but the boy did not care to even respond to me and I ended up paying for six months of his friend’s rent too until I finally solved the problem by getting my name out of the lease.
2. Jack have a very rude and entitled attitude. He speaks to us like we are his low performing employees, the only time he contacts us is when he wants money and goes no contact otherwise, and we don’t know what we ever did to him to treat us that way.
3. Last year when my wife had to be hospitalized, all of my kids flew back home to be there for their mother. Jack didn’t want to but one of his siblings bought him a ticket and talked him into flying out. Instead of being glad to be beside his very sick mother at the hospital, he spent the entire visit making everyone run errands for him (his sister has to cook a very specific type of meal for him/we had to drive him to the gym at a very specific time he demands etc) and acted like it was one huge inconvenience for him to have to fly out.

I even talked to my other kids about  whether we were bad parents that caused Jack to act this way but all my other kids don’t know why he ended up so entitled and spoilt. The rest of my kids are extremely different  from Jack, we all get along with each other and care about one another.  For the rest of my kids, I spent maybe $100K on each kid’s total college expenses.  With Jack’s  careless spending habits and unwillingness to save us any money, Jack’s college years ended up costing me $180k. So I refused to buy the promised car. Jack’s upset and has gone to his grandparents complaining about me. My MIL already hates me and now is calling me an asshole saying I am playing favourites because I bought everyone a car and not Jack.",Ill_Air_2551,5730,1170,0.959999978542328,0.4034649748479615,1703283670,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18oqjjy/aita_for_not_buying_my_son_a_car_like_i_did_for/,2023,12,AmItheAsshole,2023-12-22 22:21:10
18n7j4y,AITA for my girlfriend having to wait to be picked up from the airport,"So my girlfriend (F26) went out of town for the weekend and I (M26) dropped her off and picked her up. Her flight was scheduled to get back at 7:40pm Sunday night. On Sunday I went to dinner at my parents house and was going to go directly from dinner to pick her up. 

During dinner I was checking her flight status to make sure I was going to be on time. The last I checked was at 7pm and it said her flight was going to arrive at 7:28. At 7:12, as I was leaving to go to the airport, I got a text from my girlfriend saying she landed, followed by a text asking why I was still at my parents house. I said I was just leaving and would be there in about 35 minutes. She texted back and said she was “so fucking pissed”, and “don’t bother, I’m going to get an Uber”, “it’s extremely irresponsible”, “you better have a damn good excuse”… to quote a few of the texts I got on the way to the airport. 

Anyway, she ended up having to wait about 15 minutes for me to get her. She says that she shouldn’t have to wait to be picked up at the airport and that I should have given myself more time just in case her flight was earlier. To me, I don’t understand why I should have to be the one to wait in the cell phone lot, especially when I’m doing a favor (which she says me taking her to the airport and picking her up is not a favor, just something I should do). In my opinion, for a flight that landed 16 minutes before the flight tracking said it would, waiting 15 minutes is not that bad and should be understandable. 

But let me know if I’m wrong! She said she talked to people about it and they all say she’s right… and I don’t like talking about relationship issues with people that know both of us.

189gl9c,AITA for telling my “boyfriends” kid I don’t intend on being her mom?,"TLDR: I helped my casual BF out by watching his kid while he went to a job interview. She didn’t want to abide by my house rules because “I’m not her mom and never will be” and I told her “I’m not trying to be your mom. I have my own kids.” 
**writing on mobile**

Context: 
I’ve (34F) have been in a casual long distance relationship for 2 years with “Matt” (40M). I set boundaries at the start of our relationship. We will never live together, he will not be involved with my kids or family, I won’t be involved in his. My kids have a dad that’s very active in their lives and we coparent amazingly. The relationship I have with Matt is just that, with *him*.  Matt agreed to these terms. Everything has been great. We never argue because we have nothing to argue about. We have our separate lives and when we’re together it’s like a break from the real world. 

Matt is relocating closer to me because he’s grown tired of the city and wants to live in a more rural place like I currently live in. He will still be roughly over an hour away so it’s within comfort. His daughter “Ava” is 12 and he was unable to leave her home as his mom had a slip and fall and wasn’t comfortable watching Ava while she was on heavy medication, she just wants to rest. He wasn’t comfortable leaving her at the hotel alone so he asked me to watch her. I agreed and we both understood it’s a one time thing. 

He tells Ava I’m an old friend but I’m guessing she’s heard my name before (it’s not a traditional American name) because of what follows.

 She was being hateful to my daughter “Rose” (11), making fun of the blemishes my daughter has on her chin. I asked Ava if she wanted to go to the basement to play any of the games down there, she said no so I told Rose to go to the basement. She did.

I then catch Ava slowly opening the basement door and I ask her to go to the living room. She refuses and opens the basement door all the way. I tell her she is not allowed down there right now but she’s welcomed to the Wii in the living room or she can pick a movie to stream. We go back and forth, then I walk to the basement door and shut it. She starts screaming at me that I’m not her mom so don’t try to act like it. That’s when I told her “Baby, it never crossed my mind because I have my own kids to parent. I have no intention of trying to be anything to you, I’m just helping your dad.” 
She went to the living room and occupied herself with her phone. I made lunch, served it, she didn’t touch it (it was sopita and cheese quesadillas). Her dad picked her up later and when he got back to the hotel he called me about what I said. He said he understands why I said what I said and it is true, but it was out of pocket to say it TO her.

18huhjo,AITA for staying with my parents and refusing to come home unless it is in the condition I left it whenever my in-laws visit.,"My husband cannot control his family. Or at least he refuses to. When his parents visit and give us shit for ""forcing"" our kids to do chores he gives in and the house slowly becomes a mess that I have been left to clean up. When his siblings visit we are expected to clean up after them. I never agreed to this so now I leave. 

I lock my office up and go to my parents' house. I meet up with his family at restaurants or other public places. 

His parents have learned now that when they visit they have to clean up after the kids or get them or my husband to do it. They tried saying that I was abusive for refusing to do housework while they visited. So I posted a picture of my home before they came and one I took during their last visit. I asked them why the house was so messy and dirty and did they have anything to do with it. They said it wasn't their mess. I replied that the house was clean before they showed up. Once they started getting dogpiled for messing up my house they threw the kids under the bus. They said my kids were uncontrollable and it was their mess. I pointed out that there was no mess until they came so obviously my kids were able to clean up.after themselves when there weren't people telling them not to. 

My husband's siblings have cancelled plans to visit because they know I won't be there to clean up after them or cook so they will have to cook or spend money on takeout and restaurants. Great outcome in my opinion. 

My husband says that I'm being unfair putting all the work of cleaning up on him. I said he has two children to help him as well as ADULT guests who should be able to not make a mess. I also told him he could just pay a cleaning service out of his discretionary funds if he wanted to let his family run rampant and not clean up after them. 

He said that I was being mean by not contributing and making him spend his money. I asked how much he normally spends on cleaning the house. The answer is nothing since the four of us keep the house clean and tidy when we are on our own.",Adept-Entrepreneur44,5263,517,0.9800000190734864,0.3000301044776981,1702510149,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18huhjo/aita_for_staying_with_my_parents_and_refusing_to/,2023,12,AmItheAsshole,2023-12-13 23:29:09
18dziyq,AITA for telling my son's mom she can have him for Xmas if she pays for a summer vacation?,"I share custody of my 8yo son Elliot with my ex. It's mostly split and we have a calendar that we revise if needed. Usually we swap him every week but around holidays we extend the times. So the ex gets him for half of this month and I get the other half.

The reasoning for this month's schedule is that she was planning on spending Xmas with her SO back at his home state. I wasn't planning on traveling. Just Xmas at home. This week the ex said her SO wanted to take her and Eli on a skiing Xmas holiday and could she actually have him the last two weeks of December. 

I said so let me get this straight. You have him for two weeks already and now you're asking for another two weeks. Where does that leave me? She told me we can talk about afterwards. I said no, we can't. I'll tell you what. You give me money upfront so he and I can take a summer vacation. 

She said that was outrageous. I said not as outrageous as asking me to give up my time up front and your refusing to give me anything up front in return. And yes, I'd be willing to negotiate if I aaked her to give up her time and let it be known and not hang up like she did.

18a5kxa,AITA for kicking out my sister in law after she lost my son while babysitting,"Over the past three months, my husband's sister has been staying with us until she got back on her feet. As part of her contribution to our household, she generously offered to babysit our kids, including our 3-year-old son with autism and with both delayed speech and language, without expecting any compensation.

However, about three weeks ago while she was babysitting, our son managed to slip out of the front door without her awareness, wandering around for approximately half an hour before a concerned individual alerted the police. 

Rather than immediately notifying my husband and I about the situation, she spent an hour searching the neighborhood before involving law enforcement. We only became aware of our son's disappearance after she had already found out that the police had picked him up and safely returned him home. There's uncertainty regarding whether she would have informed us if the police had not explicitly instructed her to do so.

In the aftermath I asked her to leave our home. My husband believes that my decision to kick her out was overly severe, labeling it as an honest mistake that could happen to anyone. He also emphasizes her lack of alternative living arrangements, arguing that it was “unjust” to leave her with nowhere else to go.

18g6dpz,AITA for not wanting my wife to send explicit pictures to a friend.,"I [34m] do not want my wife [30f] to share explicit photoshoot pictures with her friend.


Recently my wife asked me if I would be OK with her doing a sexy photoshoot, initially I was hesitant however I thought this might be a good confidence boost for her. For the record I always have found her very attractive but she has struggled a little for body confidence since having our 2 kids so after some thought I encouraged her to go ahead and offered to front half the cost to support her going.

Fast forward a few weeks after the photoshoot and she is invited to view the pictures online via a meeting. She asked me to sit with her and pick out pictures I liked so I obviously obliged, it's not every day you get an opportunity like this, right?

After picking out maybe 10 photos and receiving them electronically she then proceeded to say she was also going to share them with her friend.

I wasn't sure how to feel about it. At first I thought she was maybe joking, she repeatedly said 'oh 'L' is going to like these'. I quickly realised she wasn't.

I told her Im not sure I'm comfortable with these being sent to others (for pretty obvious reasons) friend or not. She responded by swiftly walking away.

Am I overreacting? Overthinking? Should I be concerned? I want her to feel great about herself, she's amazing and deserves to feel that way. In light of the tough time I've been having mentally I'm not sure she fully understands how this is making me feel even though I've communicated this the best I can without making it awkward.

Please help.

18bobt5,AITA for making a big deal about my supervisor eating tuna?,"Throwaway, on mobile. 

I (30F) am 18 weeks pregnant. I had a very rough first trimester with morning sickness which is now tapering off, but I still have it some days. During my first trimester, I found out the hard way that the smell of tuna will trigger vomiting for me. 

My supervisor, let’s call him Dave, whose office is about 10 feet from my desk will usually eat tuna and crackers for lunch. I disclosed my pregnancy to HR and Dave in the same meeting, and HR shooed him out to discuss my maternity benefits. I took the chance to question if I could ask Dave to refrain from tuna until I felt better as it triggers my morning sickness and I can smell it at my desk when he eats it. I was told I can certainly ask, but that HR cannot enforce anything as it isn’t a documented allergy, which I was ok with. 

Talking to Dave one-on-one, I asked if he could not bring tuna in, or at least eat it in the break room that’s a good 50ft from our office area. He said yes without hesitation as he doesn’t want to be the cause of me being sick or interrupt my work flow. I profusely thanked him.

12 weeks later and I am feeling much better than I was. Last week we did a test run in the break room to see if tuna still bothered me, and it does. I apologized and Dave was a bit huffy about it, but I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Which brings us to today. I came back from lunch and Dave’s door was closed which is not unusual. I’ve been sitting for about five minutes when Dave pops out to chat with one of my coworkers and the tuna smell instantly hits me. Goodbye lunch.

Dave starts telling me I’m overreacting and just being dramatic. That I can’t expect everyone to cater to my pregnancy. My coworker tell him to back off and helps me get to the bathroom to clean up. I come back to my desk about 5 minutes later, someone used Febreeze but the tuna smell is EVERYWHERE and I get sick again. I grab a paper mask to try to mitigate the smell, but tuna is still all I can smell. 

After 20 minutes I can’t take it anymore and request if I can go home early. Dave huffs and asks if I can’t make it the final 3 hours. I told him no, and he hits back with that my leaving early will affect my end of year review. I said “so be it” and got  out of there.

On my drive home I get a call from HR. Dave told them what happened, and they again reiterate that they cannot keep Dave from eating whatever he wants in his office. I ask if my desk can be moved further away at least, to which I got “we’ll look into it, but don’t expect anything”. They ended the call by saying to should seek other medication from my doctor so my illness isn’t an office problem. 

So now I’m home, feeling like crap and waiting to hear back from my OB.

18t89ry,AITA for telling my daughter she needs to move out before getting engaged?,"Leah is 20 & is currently working part time while attending community college part time. She contributes a small percentage of her income (less than 20%) to help with rent/utilities/household expenses and the rest is hers to save/spend. She doesn't have a car and doesn't pay for any other expenses (insurance, etc) as those are all covered.

She's been dating her girlfriend Sophie for almost two years now and they're serious about each other. They're long-ish distance (about an hour away from each other) and only see each other once a month or so. Sophie lives with her family still as well, only she doesn't pay for household expenses and isn't responsible for any chores. Recently they seem to be getting really hype on talking/fantasizing about getting married and picking out engagement rings &tc. 

Last night Leah was telling me all these plans. ""Sophie is going to get me a sapphire engagement ring when she proposes"" ""I think I'm going to wear (x)"" 

And I was like ""It all sounds really nice hon, but I hope you're keeping your priorities in line. If you're grown enough to put a ring on your finger, you're grown enough to move out and support yourself.""

Leah wasn't happy to hear that and said they can move in together when they get married, and being engaged wouldn't really make any difference so why should she have to move out right away if they get engaged.

& I told her that personally, I don't believe in marrying someone you've never lived with. I think it's terrifically short-sighted, especially because Sophie is 21 and her mom still does everything for her. But also because neither of them truly understand the responsibilities and pressures of supporting themselves. Especially in the current economy. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with having these fantasies and dreams with a partner, and I emphasized that. My intention was to caution her against getting swept away in it/prioritizing it above other milestones that would help her survive independently.

She told her aunt (my sister) about the conversation later and her aunt called me and chewed me out for spitting on a harmless romantic fantasy. I said if it's really that harmless, she shouldn't be bothered by the idea of having to wait.

18or5p8,AITA for asking my daughter to check up on our house while we were away for vacation?,"Back in the summer, my wife, son and I went to Singapore for two weeks for vacation. Our daughter had to stay behind for work.

I am 64. My wife is 61. Our son is 20.

Before we left, I asked my daughter to drive by our home while we were away to check on it every once in awhile. I even gave her our keys.

The day she picked us up from the airport, I asked her if she had stopped by our house while we were away. She said no, which honestly was disappointing and confusing. Even if she didn't remember my request, I thought my daughter would be thoughtful enough to check our home to see everything was okay. But, I decided to not ask more about it and left it at that.

A few months after we got back, my daughter took an apprenticeship where she had to live only an hour away from her apartment. She asked our son to occupy and housesit her place for 6 weeks, a much bigger request then we were even asking of her to just check our house for a 2 week vacation.

All of this has felt like a slight, and a bit self-absorbed on our daughter's part. I didn't feel it was a big enough point to bring up to her, but I did want to get it off my chest, so I have mentioned how I felt about this to my wife and son a couple of times.

I just learned today that my son told our daughter about what we've been saying. He said that her explanation was that she simply ""didn't think about it"" (checking our house during the two weeks), but that's my point: the carelessness bothered me. As well, she said it's unfair to compare the two, but I feel differently.

Its terminal and hes expected to pass within a year but that *could* change if we are lucky but with the type of cancer its unlikely. 

I just want to focus on giving my brother the best time for the time he does have left. The problem is our mother. She is putting her grief onto my brother and he has to sit around helping people grive the life hes going to lose rather than giving him a great life for how ever long he want. 

I understand grieving, i am too but i dont put that on him and its not like i want my mum to go through it alone but my brother is NOT the person to share her greif with. 

The other night i saw out mum just crying and holding him saying she doesnt want to lose him. Afterwards when my brother was asleep i told her she needs to stop grieving for him in fornt of him and if she cant do that she shouldnt at all. That shes making her own dying son deal with her own grief when hes already dealing with his own mortality. She should be supporting him, not the other way around. If she wants support she can talk to me, dad or a therapist but don put your shit on him. 

I do think i was a bit harsh, but it comes from a place of frustration.

18epdol,AITA for not giving up my seat for a woman with a baby?,"So we went to the city today with the public transport bus. I am 27, have a walker because of MS and cannot stand up easily. The aisle of the bus is not wide enough for my walker to go through. I took one of the seats for people with a disability. Parked my walker in front of me. 

A couple of stops later, a few women got in with a stroller. They looked very annoyed seeing me sitting there and basically expected me to stand up and give up my seat. The bus was extra large with a connection bit in the center. My spot could be used for disabled people but also for strollers. 

Her friend offered to move the stroller to the second part of the bus, where there was lots of space to put the stroller. The mother of the child refused to do this, saying she doesn't want the stroller to be lifted in the air. This wasn't necessary, as they could have gotten out of this part of the bus and into the second part of the bus. 

She asked me if my stroller could go there, I said no because my stroller is too wide for the aisle and I will literally fall without the stroller. Also, it takes a lot of energy for me to move. She raised her eyebrows and put the stroller in the door opening with the door closed. No passenger could get out of that door. Meanwhile she kept looking angrily at me.

I texted my brother (30M), her father, to see if they had gotten my gift. He just said yes. I thought this was a weird, short answer (I mean, he didn’t even say thank you or anything else), so I followed up and asked if my niece liked it. Eventually, after some hesitation, my brother told me that his wife (31F) read some of the stories with my niece and she (my SIL, not my niece!) thought they were disturbing and inappropriate for a 6-year-old.   
  
Bear in mind, I read those tales myself when I was her around my niece's age. It’s the original version of those classic tales like Cinderella and Snow White, except they don’t sugarcoat the darkest aspects of the story. It didn’t traumatize me in anyway and millions of children have read them throughout history.

18or36x,AITA for refusing to speak to my husband over his Christmas plans,"My husband is Jewish and I am a culturally Christian atheist (went to Catholic school, grew up celebrating Christmas and still celebrate w family and friends). A few weeks ago I mentioned I was getting two extra days off from work at the holiday and that I thought we should use the time to start prepping the nursery. I'm 5 months pregnant and the room needs some work- furniture and guest bed removed, sickeningly bright green walls repainted, carpet deep cleaned. At the time he agreed. Well it turns out not only did he NOT take any additional time off himself (he has weeks and weeks of unused vacation), he has made plans to spend Christmas with his (Jewish) parents. They apparently invited him since he didn't get to visit on his dad's birthday or Hanukkah because of COVID in their household. I just found all this out today when I said we should start the nursery on Christmas day, since we usually visit my family on Christmas Eve and I'll be busy Saturday doing last minute shopping and wrapping.

I'm floored. My husband chose to disregard our plans and spend the holiday with people who DO NOT celebrate it rather than with his wife who DOES. And he wasn't planning to tell me about it. I already knew he struggles to ever say no or set boundaries with his overbearing parents (who could have easily scheduled time Friday or Saturday before Xmas Eve or next week to gather), but this seems so beyond anything I would have expected from him. I'm starting to feel like we're not even married anymore. He didn't consult me on his plans for *Christmas*. He's leaving me alone that day and the next to deal with the nursery *on my own*.

18d7ray,AITA for not letting my brother take credit for a pricey gift I got for his daughter?,"Heya Reddit!

So some backstory to start: I (32f) have an older brother Rob (37m). Rob has three kids (15f, 8m, & 6m). His two younger boys are he and his wife's kids, where as his oldest (who I'll call Kat) is from a previous relationship. 

Kat splits time 50/50 between her mom and Rob. This xmas she'll be with him. Usually Rob&wife+kids, our parents, and myself do a Christmas dinner/gift exchange together but it usually revolves around the younger kiddos nowadays. Rob and Kat's mom are both saving up to buy Kat a vehicle when she starts driving; Kat is aware of this and knows this means less 'big' gifts until then, but I felt kinda bad that all she's not getting that much for xmas.

Kat is very into gaming/mods/3d renders & has wanted a nice gaming PC for a while (all she has is an older laptop at the moment). I've got few expenses and a disposable income, so I figured ""what the hell"" and decided to go ahead and buy one for Kat for xmas. I told both Kat's mom and Rob about my idea for it before purchase; they both signed off on the idea. I found a nice prebuilt for around $1700 and ordered it. When I showed Rob the PC, he seemed taken aback and said he didn't realize it was an *ACTUAL* PC and *that* expensive.

Rob wants me to give the gift to Kat as from ""Mom, Dad, and Aunt \[MY NAME\]"". He's offered to purchase a monitor to include with the PC to make it ""fair"". I told him no, and if he wants to buy a monitor that's great, but a $200 monitor isn't the same as a $1700 PC. Rob isn't happy with this, and says I'm trying to undermine him and make him look bad to Kat.

1) I think thats crazy, I just want to do something cool for my niece.  
2) why is it bad that I want credit for a gift I researched & purchased on my own?  
3) wouldn't it be unfair for Kat's mom to ALSO not get credit if Rob does?

Rob wants me to either let him and SiL to also claim credit for the gift or wait until her bday (in 8 months!!) to give the PC so he isn't 'overshadowed' by me.

18llxr8,AITA for refusing to go to my BF's son's wedding?,"This is a burner account (obviously) as I don't want any trace back to who I am.

I (31M) have been in a relationship with an older man (65M) for 2 years. The age difference surprises some people but it's fairly common in gay culture + he is a sweet, intelligent, fun-loving man who looks fantastic.

Let's call this boyfriend James. He was married for a few years and while very civil with his ex-wife, they have been divorced for a long time and their marriage - each has admitted - was toxic. They had one son (Junior). James struggled coming out for several years but has proudly been out and proud for a few years prior to us meeting.

James's son, we will call Junior (Jr), has known about his father's sexuality for years and was polite to me at first but quickly soured after about 6 months when it was clear I was not just a fling.

Junior is a few years older than I am - which was weird at first but I think it's time he gets over it.

James and I love to travel, try new things, etc. and due to the fact James sets the plans and - let's be frank - its farther along in his career elects to pick up the check 90% of the time. Junior (the son) has started calling me ""the sugar baby"" or just ""the baby"". 

I don't cross paths with Junior very often and to keep the peace, simply have to let any negative experiences go to not give James any undue stress.

I know how our relationship looks - and James and I have had many long conversations on the subject. We are both comfortable, having fun, and have great communication.

NOW

Junior (the son) is getting married in a few months. I was not directly invited but James naturally has marked me down as his plus one. Junior is marrying a lovely girl closer to my age. Last week, during a rare dinner that we were all present for, Junior was really nasty to me and made some unkind remarks.

It is clear that Junior has resentment toward his parents for their divorce, toxic family life early in his life, etc. He also thinks I am trying to weasel my way into the father's life for financial benefit (James built several companies that do really well).

LOOK: I am not without sympathy - if my father started dating someone a few years younger than me - regardless of gender - I would be taken aback and weirded out AT FIRST.

After 2 years though it is clear - to all of James' friends and his employees - that I am good for him. He is happier, taking more time away from his businesses, and just overall most pleasent.

I have done my best but I am done being a punching bag at every event the son and I are together at.

**I am refusing to go the wedding and while James is trying to be understanding - he is clearly hurt.**

I have made it clear that I fully support him going or even taking someone else as a date. I am not trying to spoil the big day - but I can't put myself in the firing line again.

18u01nt,AITA For Not Letting My Ex Wife See My Daughter?,"
I just got through a rough divorce. My wife of 8 years was caught having an affair with another man and when I found that out I was devastated and went immediately to start filing papers. It’s been 4 months since we officially separated and my daughter is taking the lack of maternal figure hard as she’s just starting to hit puberty and it will be harder for her without someone with experience in that regard to guide her.

I’ve tried to go no contact with her but she refuses to leave me and my daughter alone.
My daughter was 2 when her mother, the love of my life passed away. About 3 years later I remarried to my now current ex wife Stephanie. She was really close with my daughter and did a great job helping raise her I will admit. My daughter views her as her mother since she was too young to remember her real mother.

Since the separation I’ve been adamant I do not want Stephanie in mine or my daughter’s life. My daughter was heart broken and while she was furious at  Stephanie, she didn’t want to cut her out of her life. I get it’s hard for my daughter who now feels like she’s lost her mother, but the last thing I want is Stephanie to try and act like she has some right to seeing my daughter or for her to try and get my daughter to think I’m at fault for the divorce.

This week  Stephanie came by the house when I was at work and brought my daughter presents and stayed at the house for several hours waiting for me to come home. I assume she thought since she brought gifts and my daughter was there I’d let her stay. I told Stephanie to leave before I call the police and my daughter started having a panic attack. Stephanie left and on the way out she told my daughter she’d call her. I said no she wasn’t and I’ve since had my daughter’s number changed and deleted Stephanie’s contact from her phone so she couldn’t remember the number.

My daughter is taking this really hard and I do feel so bad for her, but she needs to understand that Stephanie isn’t her mom, is a bad person, and doesn’t deserve my daughter in her life.

18g73xa,AITA for taking my earbuds out of my wife's sister's hands?,"Ever since I was a teenager, I(39M) have been dealing with anger issues. My folks sent me over to an anger counselor when I was 16.

I have earbuds that I've had for over 5 years, and I take them and just listen to music away from everyone else. I have a special anger playlist I’ve been working on for a while, I’ve assembled all kinds of songs on it.   


This has helped me a lot but it's not always easy. For instance, my wife and I were having a huge argument over something that I'm not going to talk about. It started small, but escalated, largely spurred on by her sister, who was also participating and almost subtly egging me on.  


I told them both that I had enough and I stood up(I was in a sitting position). I took my earbuds out of my pocket and headed outside to my spot, but my wife's sister blocked the door. I tried to pull her away from the door but as I reached my hands she took my earbuds. At that point, I was so over everything, I told her to give my earbuds back, she said that we needed to talk about this and that I can't just leave, I told her again, but she tried to give my earbuds to my wife so I quickly grabbed them out of her hands and then loaded up my ""anger"" playlist.  


When I got home, my wife locked me out, and made me wait outside for 30 minutes. When I was finally let in, my wife's sister had left, but my wife said that what I did wasn't ok. I thought I was deescalating and preventing anything from happening, but my wife said that I scared her and her sister.

18rkmse,AITA for calling my bf out for asking my son ‘what is wrong with you’ after my son used his foot to close the car door?,"AITA for getting pissed that my boyfriend asked my son ‘what is wrong with you?’ after my son used his foot to close the car?

We [me (36f), my boyfriend (33m), my son (11) and my daughter (14)] were coming home from Christmas at my mother’s house (2 hour drive, rainy weather). My boyfriend drives a nice car, worth roughly $60k. My 11 year old son was getting his belongings out and used his foot to close the door. 

Yes, he was wrong to do this. We all know how much pride my bf takes in his car and how nicely it is kept. My bf said (voice raised) ‘woah woah, don’t use your foot, what is wrong with you?’  

My son turned red and quickly said ‘I don’t know, I don’t know what I was thinking’. 

I agree that something should have been said. And I know I can be a bit over protective. My son is on the spectrum, although very high functional/low support is needed. I do have to repeat things to him. 

It just felt like a punch to the stomach to hear that. I value feelings over things, and although my son has brushed it off, I don’t want him to hear these types of things said to him. 

We also have not had the nicest things and my car is old and gross and I don’t treat it with respect. I do take the blame for that. My bf says I have rose colored glasses when it comes to my kids and he views it as disrespect to use your foot. I view it as his hands being full and not thinking in the moment.

188q7b6,"AITA for Making my Boyfriend think he Ate Chicken when I Substituted it For Quail, and Did Not Tell Him About it?","I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend (22M) for 2 years. He is a very picky eater, despite the fact he comes from a family who enjoy eating seafood and other stuff. The only meat my boyfriend eats is chicken and mutton, and it is sooo frustrating since I LOVE trying new things and love seafood, sushi and the like - however I can never share that experience with him. 

&#x200B;

Today, I decided to make some curry with naan bread - that's how a relative of mine made me try Quail meat when I was young - and told me it was chicken. And I LOVED how flavourful and tender it was. Thinking that Quail is a safe bet since it is so similar to chicken, I thought why not do the same? 

&#x200B;

So last evening I prepared an elaborate meal and he LOVED it. Thought the texture was a little different but I told him I treated the ""chicken"" with baking soda before grilling it and tossing it in the sauce. He took three full servings of it and that made me so happy. Onto worse things now. 

&#x200B;

Later as we were getting ready for bed, I quizzed him about the meal and asked for his thoughts. And then I revealed to him that what he ate wasn't chicken - but Quail meat. His facial expressions immediately contorted and he started interrogating me. I told him I had good intentions at heart and only wanted him to be a bit more open minded and if I had told him what I was cooking he would not even had a bite. He grew angrier and his face lost some colour.

&#x200B;

And he made himself throw up in the bathroom. What the fuck, were my thoughts. It was embarrassing. We are not talking now. I am utterly disappointed at how disrespectful he is being by throwing up the food I took so long to prepare. And he isn't talking to me.

As the wedding approaches, Jess drops a bombshell – she's uninviting Will because of how he treated me during that challenging time. I understand her concern, but he's genuinely changed and even gifted them money for their wedding photos. I tried explaining our progress, but she remains firm.

18o0mzh,AITA for excluding my BIL on our Christmas gift to my in-law?,"My wife and her siblings decided to go in on a big Christmas gift to their parents instead of giving them a bunch of little gifts. After months of looking around, they decided to get them a new sofa set since the one they have now is a little old and crusty. They aimed for a price of about $3000. They decided that we will cover $2000 of it and they will split the remaining $1000. Their brother has been out of work and can’t afford to chip in so my wife decided to cover his portion and still add his name to the gift. She asked me about it and I was perfectly fine with it.

The problem started when we went to look for it. We spent weeks driving around looking for perfect set and he never once joined us. Despite not having a job, he never had the time. That annoyed me but I let it go. The other day we went to a local store and saw the perfect set but it was the last one they had and they can’t deliver until January so we had to take it with us. My BIL has a truck so we called him to come help us get it but guess what? He was busy. I ended up calling a couple of work buddies and they came to help us pick it up, take it to the in-law, and set it up. At this point my BIL has put in zero effort.

Her parents are out of town visiting relatives and will be returning around Christmas. Last night I told my wife that we’re not covering her brother’s portion and if he wants his name on the gift, he’ll have to come up with his portion or the other siblings can cover it. We got into an argument about it and she accused me of cutting him out of the gift because I know they can’t afford it. I argued that he can’t just expect to show up and take credit after not doing anything to earn it. She said he’s been sad since he’s been out of work and I said he can still drive his truck and lift boxes while being sad. I said my buddies have done more than him so their names should be on the gift. She called me an AH for saying that but I obviously disagree.",WorkingBarracuda3550,1642,203,0.959999978542328,0.0988821998071003,1703201570,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18o0mzh/aita_for_excluding_my_bil_on_our_christmas_gift/,2023,12,AmItheAsshole,2023-12-21 23:32:50

Today I saw that our energy usage was nearly £14 by 8pm. I asked my wife to use energy more consciously, and to be considerate of things like multiple tumble dryer loads rather than just the immediate needs and to hang the rest, not to treat every red light as a race track green light when it appears, etc. 

Her response has, in short, somewhat taken me by surprise. She has suggested that:

If we are short of money, she will return the shirts she brought me today. 

That asking her to consider hanging washing rather than tumbling it is to utilise time she does not have. 

That I had used energy being at home, having a shower, and using my laptop all day. At her insistence no less as my plan had been to go into the office today before she asked me not to. 

Her parting shot before going to bed was that “top job, I haven’t even had a shower today” .. when no less than 3 hours precious I had asked whilst cooking dinner if she was in the shower or not, and she said she’d rather have one tomorrow.

18orrfi,WIBTA for not attending vegan Christmas dinner?,"Background: my sister went vegan about two years ago. She went to culinary school and is by far the best cook in the family, so she usually cooks Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner, though I also cook and host sometimes. This year, she wants to host and cook all vegan food for Christmas dinner. I will and do eat vegan food with her, but this year has been really hard for me (for unrelated reasons) and I would prefer to eat things with butter and cheese on Christmas. 

I asked her if she would be willing to cook vegetarian food, but she said no. I asked if we could eat out instead, so that she could get something vegan and I could eat non-vegan, and she said she didn't want to do that. I responded that I would skip Christmas dinner, in that case. She and other members of my family are quite upset at me.

I feel I've tried to compromise and she hasn't. I feel I may be TA, though, because she wasn't opposed to me cooking my own food and bringing it over, but I would have rather eaten out than made an entire separate meal and transport it.

Every year, we give the kids money to spend on other family members, this year they got $100 to spend on each sibling, $50 on us, their cousins, and their grandparents and $30 on aunts and uncles. The 3 oldest can pick stuff that they think the others would like fairly easily, obviously, we substantially helped our 2 year old pick gifts.   
  
Earlier this year, Liam saw a tiktok of some guy going to a thrift store and finding basketball merch, Liam plays basketball and wanted to see if he could do the same and he found some really nice stuff. Ever since then, Liam has been a huge fan of thrifting. He has found $50 or $100 items for a few bucks. Liam also wanted to thrift gifts this year, and the vast majority of the gifts he got were thrifted, this also means he was able to get each person quite many gifts, my husband and I had to get some big black trash bags to fit them all.   
  
The kids all shop for Christmas gifts seperately, so they didn't know which stores each other were going to. Last night, we were in the living room watching The Polar Express and my husband had paused the movie to make hot cocoa during the hot cocoa song/scene. We had started talking about Christmas and Liam had mentioned he got some gifts at various different thrift stores earlier in the day. Kayla said that was ""gross"" and ""you better not have gotten me any gifts there"", she said that she was ""above that filth"".   
  
I will admit, we are quite priveleged and live in a priveleged area, so when my daughter said that, I asked where she learned that, she said her friends said similar things. I told her that was not nice and she needed to apologize, she refused and we started arguing until my husband intervened and said he would come up with something. After talking to me once the movie was over, we agreed that Kayla should have to write an apology letter to Liam for insulting him and why thrifting can be a good thing to do.

18uzbge,AITA for giving my child the same name as my friends stillborn baby?,"I (26F) am currently 7 months pregnant and a few weeks ago we found out that we were having a little girl. My husband (28M) and I had already decided on what to name our baby depending on the gender, and upon finding out that she was going to be a girl, we announced that we would name her Adelaide. I first heard of this name when I was a kid and thought it was beautiful, and decided that if I ever had a daughter, I would name her Adelaide.

After hearing this, one of my friends (27F), who I have been close with since we were at University, began acting distant towards us. Throughout my pregnancy I have tried to be sensitive to her feelings, as I knew it was a sore point for her. Two years ago, she tragically lost her baby girl to a stillbirth. I can’t even begin to imagine how heartbreaking this must have been for her and I made sure I supported her through this devastating loss. Despite her trauma, she has never been anything less than kind and empathetic towards me, up until that day. A couple of weeks later, she confronted us, suggesting we change the name of our baby, to which we rebuffed. She kept on trying to convince us, suggesting different names, or saying that Adelaide was too old-fashioned or that it wouldn’t suite our child. We kept on denying to change her name, until eventually my friend started crying and revealed that Adelaide was the name she’d chosen for her stillborn baby.

When she was pregnant, she refused to tell anyone her baby’s name, as she wanted it to be a surprise for when she was born. After the stillbirth, she decided she would keep the name to herself because it was personal to her, to which we understood. Until recently, no one knew what her baby was going to be called. She claims that, by keeping our name, we are disrespecting the memory of her baby. She said that if I chose the same name then my daughter would be a living reminder of what could have been.

188oxx1,AITA for not pretending to like my husband’s gift?,"I (33F) have been married to my husband (37M) for 10 years. He’s a great husband and father but he is absolutely terrible at gift giving.

Several years ago, I told him I wanted a specific, inexpensive t-shirt with a funny to me saying on it for Christmas.  I showed him the shirt on Etsy multiple times. I thought it would be super easy for him to order and he didn’t have to worry about coming up with his own idea. He did not buy me the shirt.

The next year, I mentioned the shirt again and, once again, he did not buy me the shirt. 

I could have purchased the shirt myself, but at this point I became petty and let it stew over the years.

Flash forward to this year. At Thanksgiving he was bragging to my SIL that he always pays attention to me and gets me great gifts. I replied “Really? I asked you for one thing - X shirt - for years and you never bought it.” 

Today, when I got the mail, we had a weird package from a known knock-off t-shirt company. I immediately realized he must have finally ordered me “the shirt.” I searched for the phrase I had wanted and found that they had multiple designs with the same phrase but none of their shirts look like the original one I had shown him and wanted. The one I wanted had basic block text in black and the designs available on this site were multi-colored with cartoon drawings and are 100% not my style. 

I peeked in the package and can confirm, it is a shirt with the saying but in a design I absolutely won’t wear. 

AITA if I tell him I don’t like the shirt when he gives it to me and make him return it for the one I want?

1af0v6p,AITA for coming to dinner basically topless?,"I've dreaded posting for a while because I'm afraid I might be the AH. But i just gotta know. So here goes. 
My parents in law and brother in law came to visit and stay for a month with my husband (27M) and i (28F) after i had my baby.
For context if it makes any difference, I'm German, husband and his family are Italian. 
The baby was 3 months old at the time and i breastfeed her. Usually I'd just nurse on the couch in the living room but because company was staying, I'd go to my bedroom. 
After i nursed her, she'd fall asleep and take a nap and I'd have some free time. Since family was visiting, i tried to plan her naps around our mealtime to spend time with family uninterrupted.
My mother in law has this thing that when food is on the table, you be there pronto.
Sometimes I'd be late coming to a meal because babies can be unpredictable and she wouldn't fall asleep right away or nursed longer than normal. To this my mother in law would barge into my room and annouce food was ready, all impatient. This startled the baby and made the process last much longer than it should have. The result is I had to eat much later than everyone else, alone, and the food was cold. It left me fuming. More work to do with the baby and I'm secluded. 
This happened several times. I asked my husband to talk to her and explain i can't always come on time.
He talked to her but she still did all this anyway. So i simply decided to stop being late to the dinners. 
The next time she barged in my room and announced food was ready, i came without hesitation. I came to the table exactly as i was. No shirt, half a bra, baby hanging on one tit. (nothing was seen as the baby's head covered up everything anyway but still) 
Ensue uproar. Goes something like:
MIL exclaims what the hell I'm doing at the table like this. I'm indecent, there are men at the table. I should be ashamed. I yell back what the hell does she keep calling me to the table for if I'm not yet ready. I have no reason to be in my room alone with my baby while everyone else is out having a great time together. 
Brother and FIL are trying not to get in on the argument. Husband ushers me back to my room and scolds me, taking his mother's side. He means he gets I'm frustrated but this action didn't help anything. But... 
After that MIL didn't bother again while i was busy with the baby. So what if i came to some meals a little after everyone had started eating. The roof didn't cave in!
Anyways everyone lived happily ever after. The end.

19euvrm,AITA for refusing to share my vacation home with my in-laws for six months after they sold their house without consulting me?,"
AITA for refusing to share my vacation home with my in-laws for six months after they sold their house without consulting me?
Background: My husband (35M) and I (33F) have been married for five years. We own a beautiful vacation home on the beach that we built ourselves and use throughout the year. My in-laws (60s) have always been welcome guests, visiting for a few weeks here and there, and contributing financially towards maintenance costs.

 Last month, my in-laws suddenly announced they were selling their house to ""downsize"" and move into a tiny condo. Apparently, they've been secretly harbouring this idea for months, never mentioning it to me or my husband. They plan to close on the sale in two weeks and then... move into our vacation home for six months while they ""figure things out.""

I was floored. This house is our sanctuary, not a retirement home extension. We use it frequently, have friends and family booked to visit throughout the year, and rely on the income it generates during peak season. My in-laws, on the other hand, haven't lifted a finger on the property themselves and contributed only minimally.

 My husband, bless his sweet heart, is more understanding. He feels bad for his parents and believes we can ""make it work."" His in-laws, sensing my resistance, are now guilt-tripping us, claiming they have nowhere else to go and offering to pay ""significantly more"" than their usual contribution.

1ae8maz,AITA for choosing my wife instead of my niece?,"I (m25) have a niece (f6), I'm her godfather, she's the only kid in the family for now so she's quite spoiled

Her birthday party was last Saturday, my sister said that my niece wanted a Disney themed birthday (Encanto), so my sister asked me to dress up as one of the characters. This is something that we usually do for my niece, since she likes it and it's fun. I said yes like three weeks ago, so please have that in mind. 

My wife (f25) is pregnant, she's nine weeks along, but she's already having a lot of symptoms and she doesn't feel great. She has a lot of nausea, some smells get her very sick and she's just feeling tired/ moody since she's not getting a lot of sleep either. 

The day before the party she had been sick most of the night, so we didn't sleep well. The party was at 2pm, my wife actually told me to go to the party *** because she could stay alone, she was tired and feeling quite needy but she was mostly ""fine"" (no nausea at the moment, she was able to eat something and was a bit more comfortable) but I felt terribly leaving her alone. So I decided to stay with her so we could cuddle and rest.

I texted my sister to let her know that I'm not coming to the party at around 1:45 or so. Now, I know my sister, I know that she and our family would've called me and send me texts to try to get me to go, so my wife and I turned our phones off so we could have a peaceful nap. 

Just as I thought, hours later when I turned on my phone again I had tons of calls and missed texts. I read the texts and it seems like at some point my niece made a big tantrum because I wasn't there (because I promised her to go as one of the characters of the movie and play with her/ the kids. She refused to do anything and listen to her parents, so long story short they had to end the party early. My whole family is absolutely blaming me for ruining the party. My sister said I'm an asshole because I promised her daughter to be there dressed up and then didn't show up, I remind her that I said yes three weeks ago, so a lot of stuff can change in those three weeks. I told them what my wife was going through and why I wanted to stay with her.

They called me off and said that she (my wife) is somehow trying to get me away from them, they said that she's an adult and doesn't need to be pampered all the time, she could be a couple hours alone. I told them off for acting and talking like that about her, and said that I can do whatever I want with my time and I told my sister that if she would've raised her daughter better than she wouldn't have made that scene. We had a big argument which ended in insults. 

Now almost everyone is on their side and not mine, am I really wrong here? I feel like they're not trying to understand the reason why I didn't go to the party, like I'd rather have my wife feel great and go to the birthday party than this. They say that I'm acting selfish but to me they're the selfish ones. Please give your opinions and I'll answer any questions if there's any

*** My wife told me to go to the party if I wanted, but she preferred me to stay since she wanted cuddles. She wasn't feeling very sick physically at the moment, but she mostly wanted emotional support

Please bare with me if I don't explain myself too well, we're Spanish 

I can't answer all the comments I'm sorry!! 

My family knows that my wife is pregnant for those who were wondering. My niece is six years old, not sixteen!! I told them I wasn't going fifteen minutes before because I was debating weather to go or not. My wife said to go but she wanted me to stay since she needed emotional support, she's needy and emotional for now... 
I know that turning off the phone is rude, sorry, I'm just used to doing it since my family is too much sometimes and they can't take a no when I do something they don't like, so I wanted to prevent that or at least postpone it

Also this was my niece's birthday party but her actual birthday was another day, that's why I didn't mention telling her happy birthday or something like that, I greeted her on her birthday day (last Wednesday)",Affectionate-Rip5017,5206,3210,0.8999999761581421,0.5134659027086081,1706568310,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ae8maz/aita_for_choosing_my_wife_instead_of_my_niece/,2024,1,AmItheAsshole,2024-01-29 22:45:10
196uaoo,AITA for refusing to pay rent in my bf mom’s house for staying there?,"So I (F19) and my boyfriend (M20) live separately. I have a place of my own that I rent, but my boyfriend lives with his mom still because she’s pretty sick and has no one else to care for her. 

I stay over there pretty often (maybe 2-3 nights a week) because my boyfriend works night shifts and his mom still needs someone to look after her, so I’m more than happy to stay over and do whatever needs doing. 

However, now she is asking me to pay $350 a month for staying round so often. 

This honestly baffles me, because I literally only stay there overnight a few nights a week, I barely use her food, I have the odd shower but that’s IT. I certainly dont use $350 worth of her stuff a month. This is on top of the $350 that my boyfriend pays her, which is fair enough because he lives there full time. 

Why should I pay rent on her house when I already have a place of my own that’s quite expensive?

I told her no, that’s not fair, but now she’s angry at me. My boyfriend is on my side but i can’t help but feel like I could be an AH.

EDIT: thank you guys so much for the support and advice, i really appreciate it. 
I just wanna clear a few things up for everyone. I’ve seen a few comments stating that I “don’t do anything” for my boyfriend’s mom. 
It was my mistake for not stating it in this post, so i’m sorry about that. I did address this in the comments but I understand that not everyone will see that. 

My boyfriend’s mom is bed bound and needs assistance into her wheelchair to get around. She can’t wheel the chair herself as she has arthritis (amongst other things) , so wheeling her chair would be much too heavy and strenuous for her. 

She needs assistance onto the toilet, into the bath, reaching into kitchen cupboards etc. Everything in her house has been adapted to be as accessible as it possibly can be, but she still needs a lot of assistance for her daily activities. 

I do a lot of these tasks for her during the night, as she sleeps a lot in the day so at night she’s pretty awake and is wanting food/water/bathroom visits. It was very clumsy of me to state in the comments that i “literally just go there to sleep and make sure she’s okay”, as that’s not the case, I just djdnt think before typing. I hope that clears things up! Again thank you for all the advice <3",Prettyintrusion,5784,2437,0.949999988079071,0.4690010019453182,1705276541,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/196uaoo/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_rent_in_my_bf_moms_house/,2024,1,AmItheAsshole,2024-01-14 23:55:41
1af1tlx,WIBTA if I press charges on my MIL for selling my collection of vintage skeleton keys to buy a new phone?,"This is somewhat urgent. My MIL is insanely entitled. And my wife's enabling of her has made our marriage very hard at times. MIL has come to us for money many times because she keeps spending herself into a hole because she's a hoarder. Recently she came to us wanting me specifically to buy her a new smartphone. And she threw a massive fit when I refused.

I had quite a collection of vintage skeleton keys. And I mean good ones. Like ones to particular hotels, the large ornate Sargents, brass railroad keys, etc. My collection as a whole should have easily been worth two to three thousand dollars. I kept them in a locked display cabinet. But yesterday I came home to find my entire collection gone. The cabinet had been forced open. I checked the CCTV for the living room, and saw my MIL force open the cabinet with a small crowbar. I called MIL and demanded she return my entire collection. She nonchalantly told me she sold the entire collection at pawn already, and used the money for her new phone. Then said it was my fault, and she had to do it because I wouldn't give her the money.

My wife was seemingly on my side, until I said I was going to call police. Now she's begging me to just drop it. And even suggested I just start a new collection. A lot of those keys are irreplaceable, and I spent 10 years building that collection. MIL has been trouble in the past. But this is the first time I know of that she's stolen from us. I need help!

194fwpj,"AITA for buying something someone had already ""claimed""?","So I (22F) was at Goodwill the other day looking around. On one of the shelves I noticed a basket turned upside down, picked it up to look at it (I was looking for a container to put my jewelry in) and found this really pretty little marble statue underneath. Like one of those ones of a lady with the arms and head cut off. I really liked it and it was only 5 bucks, so I decided to get it. But this lady near me noticed what I was holding and said ""Uh oh. This other lady was looking at that. I think she hid it under the basket so no one else would see it"". I asked if she was gonna buy it, the lady said she wasn't sure. She looked around and said she didn't see the woman anywhere. I felt a little bad, but I carried it around for a while looking at other stuff, and figured if that lady saw me holding it she could come argue with me if she felt like it. 

After maybe 10-15 more minutes of looking, I was ready to leave and went to the checkout. Right when I set my stuff down I heard this voice say ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" And this older lady came up right next to me and put her hand on the statue. I noticed a man was with her, probably her husband. ""I was gonna buy this, I hid it. It's mine"" she said. I don't like confrontation, but I was also kinda mad that she was already getting in my face. I said ""I've been carrying this around and you haven't come up to talk to me about it until now. I didn't know you were set on buying it""

""Well didn't you notice it was hidden? I was making up my mind and I hid it so no one else would see it. And I decided, I'm gonna buy it"" 

""Someone told me a lady was looking at it, but I didn't know you were gonna buy it. I'm sorry, I'm already getting it"" And we both looked at the poor cashier, who kind of shrugged and said ""yeah I mean she's already up here buying it. And you can't really call dibs on something, you haven't purchased it yet"". Then the lady's husband gets involved and says ""cmon kid, let her have the statue. We're gonna put it on the dining room table. Where are you gonna put it, your desk?"" And I said YEP I am because I'm buying it. 

They both just kind of scoffed and looked at each other like I was some young punk who had just disrespected them or something. I give the cashier my card, I sign for it, he hands me my bag, meanwhile they're still standing there. I don't think either wanted to do something as blatant as physically take it from me. The lady said ""You want it that bad, even though I already was gonna buy it? I've been looking for a decoration like this for months. Are you gonna die if you don't have it? And I said ""yes I am"" and I walked out cause I didn't feel like fighting anymore. Meanwhile they followed me outside (and lucky me we parked near each other) saying stuff like ""no respect!"" and ""unbelievable!"" 

And I swear to God I think the woman even said ""what a little bitch"" before she closed her door",sunny543,6387,1044,0.9800000190734864,0.3699115541276527,1705015606,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/194fwpj/aita_for_buying_something_someone_had_already/,2024,1,AmItheAsshole,2024-01-11 23:26:46
194gbbk,AITA for not letting my ex husband to bring his now wife to our daughters birthday party,"(I will be using fake names btw)

My ex husband (David) and I were married for 5 years and last year we divorced. We have a one  daughter (lily) who recently turned 7 this year.

Lily's birthday was around the corner so I was busy with decorations,  the cake and the invitations. I asked her who she wanted to attended her birthday party and she said she wanted her aunts , uncle's,  cousins basically everyone she knew from both sides .

I wasn't bothered with  lily inviting anyone from her fathers side because we were both familiar and comfortable with them . I called David and I told him about the invitations and he was cool with it until he bought up his wife. He told  me that he will bring his wife , he didn't ask me , he told me like he was forcing it because he knew I would say no and I did say no . 

I told that I was not comfortable with his wife especially her meeting lily and lily doesn't even know her that much   and I haven't even had a proper talk with her before she can see my daughter. The only thing I knew about this lady was that she did something wrong with my husband knowing very well he's married and has a daughter and I was supposed to feel comfortable with that. 

He then told me that I was making this about me and not lily , that lily is child , she doesn't even know anything yet and he really wants lily to meet his wife and she also wants to meet her . I said to him that if she really wants to meet lily then she has to speak to me first and see how she really is before I can trust her with my baby. 

He replied to me by saying that I was jealous and that I didn't want lily too see her new family and be comfortable with them and that i was hurting his wife because I wouldn't let her see her step daughter who is like her own daughter. 

I was done with him and told him if he didn't want to come then it's fine it's not like he payed a single dime for anything for the birthday party and he was crazy for me to say yes to a woman who ruined my marriage and is the reason why my daughter has to grow up with separated parents .

EDIT: The step mom does know lily and lily knows that she does have step mom but they haven't met which is not my responsibility and yes David does have visitation rights so I don't know why he doesn't introduce them to each other. That's reason why step mom said she also wants to meet her.

19bocje,AITA for dressing inappropriately in front of my BIL?,"So to start this off, this issue is with me 22f, my sister 26f and her husband 30m. 

To add some backstory, basically ever since they started growing, my breasts have been large, I have a very small frame otherwise and I am 5ft2, so almost my whole life I have thought that my body looked weird. I have always covered up as best as I could with large hoodies, big t-shirts and so on. I have always dressed this way as I genuinely was ashamed and hated my body. I started working at 16 knowing my main goal was to afford a breast reduction, last year I was finally able to afford it and got them done. They are still a bit on the bigger side, but I have never ever felt so comfortable and happy in my own body as I do now (not to mention the weight that has LITERALLY been lifted off my shoulders!?). 

So this last weekend my sister and her husband came to visit our family, and we had planned a dinner at a restaurant. It was nothing extravagant, but still a pretty nice place. I just wore jeans with a tight fitting shirt, it did not show my breast but since it is tight fitting you can see the outline of them. I thought everything went well, we all chatted and talked like usual, but a bit in I noticed BIL was staring at me extremely much. I got kind off uncomfortable and I think my sister also noticed and she was silent for almost the whole night after that. I thought she was mad at BIL and that she could see that I was uncomfortable with his stares.

But the same night she texted me, telling me that I did not need to dress so inappropriate in front of a married man, that I need to have some self respect and that she did not think I was the type to try and seduce a married man. I texted her, explaining that it was not my intention and told her that I actually felt uncomfortable with his stares. She texted me back just saying that if I did not want him to stare, then I should have not dressed that way.

I was extremely upset by all of this and talked with my mother, but my mother agreed with my sister. I am starting to feel like I should’ve thought about covering up and do more, especially since my mother also thinks I was an asshole for this..",throwaway2847362662,4712,1063,0.959999978542328,0.2992081384868963,1705791263,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19bocje/aita_for_dressing_inappropriately_in_front_of_my/,2024,1,AmItheAsshole,2024-01-20 22:54:23
192thmi,AITA for not wanting to spend the entire vacation sun up to sun down with my husband’s family?,"My husband and I were planning a vacation for us and our 2 kids. We’ll be gone for 8 days in the summer. We’ve saved for this trip for years and were super excited.

This place is about 3 hours away from my husband’s family. They invited us to spend some days with them. However, from the start I said I wanted alone time with just the 4 of us. With the kids getting older, we don’t get a lot of time with them. We don’t have the money to travel often. I suggested 3-4 days with his family, then we’d go to the actual vacation spot. I also set the boundary we’d stay in a hotel. They all seemed to agree.

Then out of nowhere, my husband’s family decided to go to our vacation spot for the full 8 days. That’s when the hints began that we all get a house to rent. I said no. I love my husband’s family but it’d just be too much and I wanted time just us. We don’t need to be around each other 24/7. After that, my SIL started making plans for all 8 days that included us. 

I put my foot down to my husband and said no. We could spend 4 days with his family, maybe 5. But I wanted just a few just us. We never get to go on vacation. And his family visits once or twice a year so it’s not like we don’t see them.

My husband says I’ve hurt his family’s feelings. When I spoke to my SIL she said I should understand why it hurts I won’t spend the entire time with them. I asked how they’d feel if they planned a trip and we tried to change the plan. She said family does this stuff for each other.

Now, I’m already dreading the trip and wonder if I’m being over dramatic and should just give in to avoid drama.

195zlrv,AITA for cooking dinner for my girlfriend instead of taking her out like I promised?,"My girlfriend (f22) and I (m22) have been dating for little over a year.

We're both in college. Tbh I don't feel like going out most of the time, so I almost always suggest my girlfriend to stay in my apartment and order something/ cook something instead of going out. I often don't want to go to parties or such with her, which annoys her a lot. 

The other day my girlfriend mentioned a new sushi (I think, or Asian food) restaurant in our town and asked if we could go. Originally I agreed, I said that we could go on Friday. However, I didn't feel like going out last night, so instead I cooked dinner for us and when she came to my apartment (so we could go to the restaurant together) I told her that we could leave it for another day and eat at home. She was annoyed and said that I always do the same thing, I told her to chill because we could go another day. It's not like the restaurant will go anywhere, right? 

I cooked carbonara pasta for dinner, but my girlfriend said that she won't have it because she wants fish, not pasta. I told her ""okay, we can order sushi if you want"" and rolled my eyes, which made her go off on me, telling me that she feels like I want to hide her? Like if I'm embarrassed of her or something, when it's not the truth at all.

She knows my family and friends, I make all the time I can to spend time with her and I'm certainly not ashamed of her because why would I be? I'm just not an outgoing person and she knows it. She had said something similar a few months ago because I didn't post enough about her on social media (I post like twice a year). I also got upset over her comment and told her to leave if she didn't like how I am, and she left.

1abvevj,"AITA for letting my Stepdad tank my mother's birthday, ""To Make Myself Look Good""?","So, it was my 20F mom's birthday, and it was her 40th, which my family regards as a milestone birthday. This birthday is a bit more important, because my mother is anxious about her 40's. Her father passed in his, so it was important to me that she begins this decade on a positive note.

My mother has been married to my stepdad for 9 years, together on and off for 16 years. My stepdad is notoriously bad at birthdays. So since I was 17, I've planned my mother's birthday, mother's day, Christmas, etc.. I've tell everyone what we're doing, what she may want, who is allowed to know what, etc. She's been noticeably happier with that arrangement. Which has left a dent in my stepdads ego. So he said he would be planning my mother's birthday, without any of my ""ornery"" supervision. He made it very clear he did not want my input. So I let him do it, sure I gave him a good example to go by.

However, as the day approached, it became clear that his plans weren't turning out as my mom would have wanted. He didn't celebrate because he mixed up the days, and took the wrong day off work, so he planned for the day before. He ordered a marble cake with whipped icing, tickets to The Color Purple, and a reservation to an Italian restaurant. Her favorite cake is chocolate with buttercream, she hates musicals, and her favorite thing to eat is steak w/ lobster tails. He didn't invite me or my siblings, to any of these plans either, as the cherry on top. Worried that my mom might be disappointed, I discreetly made backup birthday plans, thinking it would be a nice surprise.

So when the day before came, I let my stepdad give her the wrong cake, a musical, and a plate of pasta. He also lied and said he had mandatory overtime at his job on her actual birthday. Obviously she did not have a good time

 So the next day, I surprised her with ""everything"". Flowers, breakfast, spa day, comedy show, and a dinner at a steakhouse, with all of her children included. And she cried happy tears into her chocolate w/ buttercream cake. Overall a wonderful success.

When my stepfather found out, he was furious, feeling like I undermined his efforts and made him look bad. He argued that I should have trusted his plans and not taken matters into my own hands, for the sole purpose to make myself look good.

I explained that I only wanted to ensure my mom had a special day, and the backup plans were meant to be a thoughtful gesture. Despite my intentions, tensions escalated as he felt his authority was challenged.

Now, I'm left wondering: AITA for trying to salvage my mom's birthday, or did I overstep by creating backup plans without consulting my stepfather?

EDIT/INFO: First off, thank you for the kind responses. I did go into it wanting to make my mom happy, and I'm happy the consensus is that it was all that mattered. Now to answer a few questions.

1.Why did my mother's husband not know jack ish about my mama? - He does know these facts about her, and I've mentioned all of these things to him before. Apparently, he got all of these ideas from his mother. Because she's the best source of information about my mom. And her words override everything I ever said about her.

2. How do I know she was upset with his plans? - The first sign is the fact I know she doesn't like those things to begin with. 2nd HE was upset with her for being quiet/short with him since dinner, he was fussing at her since they came in the house. 3rd She came home and went straight to bed, without speaking to anyone. The difference between that, and how my events ended, are very apparent. I'm not pulling that out of my behind.

3. Why did I allow him to make the plans at the expense of my mother's day? - I didn't ""allow"" him to do anything. He's a grown adult man, and I'm not a babysitter. I had nothing to gain from his failure, but a sad mom. I probably would've said something if he had bothered to celebrate on the proper date. She still had a great time at the end of the day. 

4. Do I dislike my stepfather? - No. I don't happen to like him though either. My father was present growing up, so he wasn't comfortable taking a parental role, or really any role, in my life growing up. So he's really just the guy my mom is married to.

5. Why is my mom with him? - She was young mother with 3 young children, his apathy towards is made her feel we could be safe in the same household with him. Now though, she's just comfortable with the status quo. She's really no fuss, so this is really only an issue on special milestone, holidays. Like for their 10th anniversary this year, she wants something really nice. But for their 9th last year, they went bowling, and she was happy. He what she needed in the beginning, now she has no reason to get rid of him, because she doesn't feel mistreated.

6. What does my mom think? - She doesn't know this wasn't the original plan. She really thinks I planned that dumpster fire, to make her birthday seem more special, because my stepdad couldn't attend. She hasn't asked me to clarify, so I won't say anything unless she does ask. So she's still happy with everyone.",Expert_Tomatillo5401,4508,436,0.9700000286102296,0.2340549545799807,1706309444,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1abvevj/aita_for_letting_my_stepdad_tank_my_mothers/,2024,1,AmItheAsshole,2024-01-26 22:50:44
1acnria,AITA for telling my aunt her miscarriage doesn’t make her special?," I(18F) have an aunt(48F) recently had a miscarriage. My sister(12F) has been really hyped up about her 13th birthday this July, I admit it’s far away from now but she’s turning into a teen so I can see why all the enjoyment. Today I came home from school to find my sister in tears( Her school isn’t open right now) when I asked her what’s wrong she said our aunt had said that she wasn’t special and that its irritating hearing her talk about it and that she is being selfish. My aunts baby was supposed to be born the same day as my sister and I know it must be hard for her but I got mad that she would say that to a little girl so I went in there to confront her.

1aco6ek,AITA for not wanting to give my step-cousin my new dress?,"My (16f) whole family (grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) is attending a formal event in a couple of weeks.

My step-cousin “Jen” and I are the same age, and her dad married my aunt when she was 6. Jen’s dad doesn’t make a lot of money, so Jen didn’t have a lot of things growing up, and my mother would always give my old things to Jen rather than throw them away. Especially for formal events, which we all attend quite often because of my grandparents, my mother would always take the dress I’d worn to the last function and give it to Jen so that her dad didn’t have to buy one. As we’re now older and not growing, I now only loan the dresses to Jen.

I assumed it would be the same this time, so a few days ago when Jen and her family came over for dinner I took Jen upstairs to give her the dress. Jen saw the new dress I had for the event and asked if I would loan her that one instead. She said she’d never got to wear a dress everyone hadn’t already seen me in and it wasn’t fair she always had hand me downs. I said no, because I’d bought the dress to wear to this event, I was being nice to lend her a dress, she doesn’t get to demand it be the new one. 

Jen and I were arguing and eventually the adults got involved. My parents stick up for me and said I don’t have to share the dress, but Jen was very upset and her dad took her side, saying it wouldn’t kill me to wear one of the many other dresses I have and just let Jen have the special one for once. I then said if she wants a specific dress he should buy it, not try and take it from kids, which set him off. 

The parents are now fighting over this dress drama, and part of me thinks maybe I should have just loaned Jen the dress. I love that dress and I was excited to wear it, which is why I didn’t, and my parents say I absolutely shouldn’t. But I don’t want everyone to fall out over it.

19aw9yl,"AITA for being a ""choosing beggar""?","I'm (27f) currently in a bit of a financial bind. I have some collectibles that I'm selling for a decent price (little cheaper than market price) for money. Some of these are limited edition video games, out of print edition books, and some rare manga. Most of them would sell for $150-300 because they're collector's items.

I listed the manga for Cowboy Bebop on eBay and the start price for the auction is $75. I paid that much when I bought them and the median price for all 5 volumes seems to be about $150-200.

My friend messaged me and said she wants the manga for her boyfriend's birthday. I asked her how much she's offering and she said $30. I said no and the price is firm, even for a friend. Then she upped the price to $35... Still too low. I sent her a link to the auction and said she could bid on it like everyone else. I added that if she doesn't like it, she's not worth being friends for such a lowball offer knowing that I'm in a bind.

1ae9e6r,AITA for getting my co-worker an allergic attack and getting her sent to the hospital?,"So I (22M) and my co-worker Lukas (23M) decided to surprise our co-worker Lily (25F) for her first year anniversary. With permission from our boss we decided to fill up her entire office with balloons, normally we start working at 9AM but for this we came in 3 hours early at 6AM.  


Together we spent around 50$ worth of equipment to do this, we finished this within 2 hours and started waiting until Lily came to the office. After 45 minutes she arrived and she went up to her office, once she got to her office she opened the door and the entire room was filled with balloons. But since there were so many, alot of them escaped the room and fell onto Lily.   


She suddenly started screaming and backed off really quickly, we went out of hiding and surprised her.  Then she said she was very allergic for latex, but I didn't understand. She explained that balloons are made of Latex, and that I should've known that she was allergic for Latex.  


After 30 minutes the allergic reaction became so severe that she had to be rushed to the hospital, I didn't mean to do this since I thought balloons were made out of rubber. It's been 2 days and she's recovering at home since returning from the hospital today.

1adgype,AITA for not wanting to help my mom after she didn't buy me food?,"I am 16f and I live with my brother 17m along with our parents. Since I'm an artist my mom asked me to paint something for a project she's working on. At first I was hesitant, and originally not going to do it since I don't make art for free, but she was being very persistent so I agreed to help just to get her to stop asking. Today she went to drop off some library books and asked me to go with her. 

She told my brother (17m) that she was going to stop to get some lunch and asked him what he wanted, he said he wasn't very hungry and not to get him anything. She never asked me what I wanted, but I assumed since I was going with her she would ask me once we got there. We dropped off the books and she started making her way home. 

I asked her if we were still getting lunch and she said ""no, your brother isn't hungry"". I said ""well I'm hungry, I haven't eaten today and there's no food at the house"". And I'm not exaggerating, we are out of food because my parents need to go grocery shopping, my mom said she'd do it tomorrow, so we won't have anything to eat until then. If we had ingredients I would just make something but we don't even have enough stuff to make a homemade meal. She called my brother and once again asked him what he wanted to eat, he said ""I'm not that hungry, just get me something small."" She never asked me what I wanted. 

We pull into the drive thru and she still didn't bother to ask me what I wanted to eat, she orders what my brother asked for and something for her self, then without asking me if I wanted anything or giving me enough time to spit out my order, she said ""that will be everything"". Then drove through the line. I was shocked, and really upset. But what really irks me is she seemed completely oblivious to what she did. She was just like ""you didn't want anything, did you?"" After we got the food.

Of course I wanted something, I told you before we pulled in that I was hungry and didn't eat anything today. She wasn't even going to get food, ahe was going to drive straight home until I said something. Then she had to audacity to tell me that I need to work on her stupid project when we get home. I'm really fed up that she keeps demanding I do this for her, without even offering me compensation, or at the very least getting me something to eat so I'm not working on an empty stomach. When we got home I told her she can do it herself, and that I won't be helping her with it. She called me rude and entitled, and maybe I am, but I feel disrespected, and I won't take that from my own mother.

Which is in my driveway. I asked her before to move her vehicle, but got nowhere. Yesterday I had it. I was pulling out and as I was nearing her car she laid on the horn for at least two minutes. She got out and started screaming “If you hit my car ill sue you for every dollar you make.” Along with some insults. I had it. I called a tow truck and they impounded her vehicle today because it was on my property.

1af0zdl,AITA for not disclosing cakes are dairy free,"I’m a hobby baker not a professional. I make cakes/cupcakes/treats for family and friends of family. I’m also lactose intolerant.

I’ve been used to cooking and baking dairy free for years now and it’s just become second nature to me. Due to regular baking I often bulk buy supplies such as dairy free butter. In all my baking I use the dairy free butter and I’ve never really thought anything of it, so unless there’s a specific flavour that’s been requested, the cakes or cupcakes are essentially dairy free.

I’ve never hidden the fact I use dairy free butter but I’ve also never made it a big deal either. Everyone always compliments the cakes and I’ve never had someone say they notice the cakes/icing etc were dairy free.

Last week I made a chocolate cake for my cousins birthday. We had a party and during the party I had a piece of cake (dark chocolate and cocoa powder are naturally dairy free so with dairy free butter the entire cake was dairy free) another cousin noticed me eating and commented on the fact that I would end up with a bad tummy. When I explained it was dairy free, she absolutely kicked off claiming I was trying to force my beliefs down everyone’s throat and that I should be declaring the fact it’s dairy free. Also should note, she had already eaten some cake and said it was lovely 🤷‍♀️ she started getting everyone involved. Some knew I tend to do dairy free and didn’t have any issue, others didn’t know and were still ok with it, and some were annoyed about it and said if they had known they wouldn’t have had the cake. Again no one disliked the cake in any way. I then got told from now on I should make sure there’s dairy in all the cakes, cupcakes and treats which means if it’s for a family event I can’t eat them.

Now I’m at the point where I don’t want to make anyone else anymore cakes for people. There was no maliciousness on my part. I understand that years ago, dairy free was a massive deal and quite often the food wasn’t tasty but nowadays things have changed. It’s not actually that big a deal anymore.

So AITA? Should I have been telling people that most of the cakes were dairy free?

  
\*\*edited to add as it’s been mentioned a few times- I always ask about any other allergies. theres a few different allergies in my family and I always try to cater to everyone. if there’s someone I don’t know that has an allergy they’ve often asked what they can eat and I direct them. In this case the only allergens in the cake was egg & wheat which no one In my family were allergic to. the butter used has no main allergens.

190bwx2,AITA for telling a doctor I don't need their consult?,"I was born with a cleft lip and had extensive surgeries to correct it. Now it's significantly less visible and the result was told to be impressive. On the unrelated note, I also have a wax issue with my ears so I have to see an ENT specialist doctor from time to time to get the wax removed.  
  
It happened to me before to have doctors (which are supposed to just remove my wax) to marvel at my cleft lip and the whole work done around it. For me it's weird because 1) I don't consider it THAT ground-breaking and 2) they're doctors, shouldn't they be more USED to that? However, I usually don't say much about it.  
  
Anyway cue doctor Jane who was supposed to remove my wax for the day. I scheduled an appointment SPECIFICALLY for that. She does it and then proceeds to ask me to open my mouth (although I told her the issue is with my EARS). I comply, foolishly imagining it's gonna be relevant to my problem but she begins talking about my cleft lip and how great the result is and wants to examine my nose point at which I stop her. I tell her there's nothing wrong with my nose and ask her if she suspects there might be an infection spreading to my ears or something. She says something like ""No, I just wanted to have a look and see more about your cleft lip..."". I stop her again (literally pushing her hands away) and keep asking if she's done with my ears. She says yes and KEEPS TRYING to see the work for my cleft lip.  
  
I told her to quit it, that I'm not sort of a museum piece that she gets to look at from all the sides and that for my cleft lip problems I see other doctors. Meanwhile I got up from the chair and started to get my stuff to leave. She said that there's no need to react like that and all she did was try to help me. I explained all the help I needed from her was with my ears and if I need more, I'll let her know. By then I was already dressed with the hand on the door handle.   
  
She kept telling me this is no way of behaving and I'm disrespectful to her. I (almost) snapped but told her as calmly as I could that for me this is not an ""interesting case"", but a lifelong condition and I'm not fond of people pointing fingers at it. I explained to her I find it unprofessional and rude. I then just left to avoid further conflict. Was I wrong?

1af2d42,AITA for asking my sister to leave because she took a nap after moving into my new house?,"I(F 23) recently bought a house. My partner and I spent 2.5 months remodeling as much of it as we could before our lease was up and we had to move in. We were over there almost every day working on it. It was really draining and I feel completely burned out. My sister(20) and friends helped us on weekends.

Fast forward to the move in date, I was so mentally, physically and emotionally drained at this point. Move in day went as smooth as moving does, we had friends to help us. My sister was going to help us but she had been asked to sing for a funeral which understandably was important for her and was at the same time we planned to move and so she planned to show up for the last part of it and stay to help us unpack.

She did exactly that and showed up as we were clearing out the last 10 boxes from the uhaul. She went to change and realized she didn't bring socks for her tennis shoes. She asked me for some and I was a little annoyed because NO, I can't find you socks right now. I have no idea where anything is  and I've been moving heavy things for the past 4 hours. I'm also disabled (I broke my pelvis when I was 17 and have mobility issues and chronic pain) and this day was really hard. She refused to do anything unless she had socks, so my boyfriend found some of his and gave them to her. She did put them on and helped with the last few boxes.

We all took a moment to eat lunch. My sister ate with us and our frineds left. My sister still planned to stay and help me unpack. I had to return the uhaul first, and I had to be the driver since I was the verified driver. I asked my sister if she would come with me to return the uhaul and she stated that she NEEDED a nap. She then proceeded to climb over all of the furniture we just moved in. She found a spot on the taken apart sectional and asked me to get her a blanket. I asked her again if she was sure she wasn't coming with me and she said no, she really needed a nap. She showed up for 20 minutes. It felt so inconsiderate. This is reacurring behavior and I feel like this was the final straw. There's history that's hard to get into. She never seems to care for anyone but herself.

I had to fill the uhaul up with gas before I returned it and got stuck trying to turn out of the gas pump area. It was a 20ft uhaul and I accidentally hit the side of it into a pole. No one was there to help me manuever it and I was doing the best I could. I was reallly upset that my sister didn't come with me because she could have helped me and this wouldn't have happened. I will have to pay for the damages.

When I got back to my house, she was still ""sleeping"" for another hour even though I was playing music and unpacking dishes loudly.

I (35M) have a stepdaughter turning 16 this Saturday. Recently she told me that she doesn't want my biological kids (17M and 14M) at her birthday party. When she told me this I was confused. I asked her why and she simply stated, ""I just don't want them there."" I asked for a reason but then she got defensive and started yelling at me and told me that it's her party and she doesn't want her step-siblings there.

She NEVER yelled at me before or even talked back so this really hurt me surprised me. I told her that if she doesn't want her step-siblings there, then there won't be a party. She then started crying and told me that she didn't ""fucking care.""

I talked to my kids and asked how they felt about their step sister because I thought that maybe she wasn't telling me something. However, the told me that they have no problems with her and were confused on why I asked. I shared this with my wife, and she supported my decision, and said that her daughters behavior was disrespectful. We both tried talking to her, but she's locked in her room, ignoring us and just crying. I decided to let her stay home today since she refused on coming out.

My wife  was aggravated and tried talking to her sister who sided with our stepdaughter. She said that she has the right to choose who attends her party. My wife stood firm with our decision, but her sister is threatening to tell to the rest of the family and I'm honestly worried and confused.

19boljy,AITA for locking my boyfriend out of the house?,"My boyfriend, Cody (27M) and I (25F) live together. However, I don't like it when his sister, Jessica (23) visits because 9 times out of 10 something in my closet always goes missing. I've confronted her and she admitted that she took some clothes (allegedly with my boyfriend's permission) because she likes my style and was hoping to return them. NONE have ever returned. So I talked to Cody and we agreed he should not allow her to come into our room when she visits, going as far as to lock whenever she's around.

That was nothing because she started taking other stuff from around the house, ranging from some food and at extreme, an entire kettle. I put a stop to this and threatened to open a theft case and that I didn't want her in the house anymore. Cody agreed with me and I thought we had an understanding.

Yesterday I came back home and at first I didn't notice but as I spent more time around the house, I noticed that some stuff was missing. This included a few pots dishes, cups, silverware, groceries and other honestly a lot more. I literally thought something broke in so I called Cody, who told me he lent Jessica his keys for her to take a few things from the house because she was supposedly ""having it rough"" lately. I argued that way more was taken and that he should have talked to me but he promised he would buy the stuff back.

It wasn't until I went to thoroughly look around our room for anything missing that I reached my breaking point because some of my clothes, hair dryer, straightener and unused lotions were gone. I called up my boyfriend again and he told me not to fuss about it as he was just gonna buy all of it again. I was beyond livid at that point.

When my boyfriend came back, I refused to let him in until he got back everything his sister took. He didn't take me seriously at first but I was not letting this go. It was either he got my stuff back or I would open a case. After about an hour, he left and he's slept over at Jessica's but is still yet to return. To no surprise, Jessica thinks I'm being petty.

Cody isn't taking my calls and I think I hurt him by refusing him entry. I'm afraid it may affect our relationship.

196tokp,AITA for refusing to speak to MIL and cancelling our wedding?,"I (f35) and fiancé (m30) are considering cancelling our wedding because of MIL

MIL has never tried to have a positive relationship with me. She makes sure I’m not included in conversations, belittles my achievements & talks down to me.

Things escalated when I was planning fiancés 30th. MIL fought me on every detail and accused me of not knowing my fiancé at all. (I planned a golf weekend away for him and his family) he loves golf. 

Fiancé confronted MIL and asked why she doesn’t like me? MIL admitted she doesn’t like me. (Doesn’t like my partner driving to events, didn’t like it took me a month to find employment when I moved to a different town to be with fiancé. Fiancé receives calls and texts from MIL daily. If he doesn’t respond, she blames me. 

Fiancé told her if she doesn’t stop this behaviour toward me he will no longer speak with her.

I agreed to meet with MIL to smooth things over and try to move forward. MIL never took me up on it. But things seemed ok for a time. 

Fast forward to fiancés brothers wedding. 

Wedding day arrives and we were to be at the venue at 4pm. Five minutes to 2pm fiancé receives call from MIL saying the family photo shoot is in 5 minutes. We hadn’t been told of a family photo shoot? MIL demands we arrive at 2pm for it. We frantically get ready and arrive at the house where the wedding was. There was never a photo shoot planned. MIL comes out and tries to hand my clothes to iron. I refused. 

MIL snaps at me asking where my son is. He was never coming. He’s at the hotel. MIL continues stating everyone thought he would be there. I respond he was never coming and we RSVP just us. She has been told multiple times he wasn't coming.

The ceremony is over & I started to have guests come up to me asking where my son is. I don’t even know these peoples names. I tell them he’s at the hotel. Looks of disgust are thrown at me. My new friends stopped talking to me. I realised these people were being told my son was at the hotel but not telling them how old he is (teenager)The wedding was a place of ridicule and disgust on me.

Christmas Day at MIL house. Her family scurry away from me on arrival, refusing to hug or greet me. One man, whom I had met once 2 years ago, aggressively accused me of leaving my son alone on Christmas Day. (Son was at fathers place this year). The rumour has continued and now not only does the MIL hate me, so do her family. 

I made up an excuse to announce the fact my son was a teenager whom just finished his first year of high school at the top of his class. Everyones jaw dropped. None of them knew he is a teen. MIL hurried out of the room.

Now fiancé wants to cancel wedding and elope because of MIL.

1999qzl,AITA for not giving up my plane seat?,"I 23 (f) recently had to fly across the Country to attend my sister Wedding. At the Airport there was a mom (around 40) with her little son (6 or 7) and the whole time she was demanding things from the airport staff. 
When we boarded the plane i went straight to my seat which was a middle seat, sat down and took out my earphones when the mother and the son arrived. 
They had the window seat and the seat and the aisle seat. Directly the woman demanded that she MUST sit next to her son and i MUST sit at the aisle so she could sit next to him.
 I dont like sitting in the aisle seat very much so i told her (friendly) that i dont really like giving up my seat as i dont like sitting there and she then started to yell that it is her right to sit Next to her son.
 I politely told her that i would be willing to change seats with her son (who had the window seat) and she continued yelling that she NEEDED the seat and that she wont accept that her son has to give up his seat as he is a child and deserves the window seat. In the end a Stewardess came and i got to sit in my originally seat. 
The mom kept 'accidentally' kicking me the whole flight and made her son annoy me on Purpose so i might give up my seat. 

When i went to the toilet i thought it was finally over as she might have accepted it but when i came back she was in my seat and my jacket and my bag which i left there were thrown into the aisle. I called a Stewardess and they made her get back onto her place.

1916dia,"AITA for not paying attention to the kids at my niece's(4) birthday party when the other adults left the room without making me aware that I'll be alone with the 7 kids, which resulted in an injured kid?","I (35f) love kids, always worked in child care jobs. During gatherings of friends or family I somehow always ended up in the kids room, helping the birthday boy and his friends assemble the new Playmobil fortress (because he asked me for help) or something like that. While the other adults eat cake around a table. Nothing wrong with them. I just always wonder how I got myself sitting on the floor surrounded by tiny humans.


But lately my health took a nosedive. Burnout and other stuff. I'm no longer good with noise and crowds or focus. I'm on disability because I can't work. My family knows this. 

When my niece had her birthday I was invited but I had a really, really bad day. I knew their apartment would be too crowded and noisy for me during the party, so I told my brother I had to cancel and come the day after. Discussing the reason, my brother convinced me to still come over for a little while, eat some cake and hug the birthday girl ""to show up and not disappoint her"". I made my limitations clear, that I can't help and that I might zone out. He said it'd be no problem.

When I came over, I sang happy birthday with them all, gave my niece her birthday hug and gift and sat myself in the living room with them, eating cake. The kids were playing, I didn't know the guest parents, it was as overwhelming as I suspected, so I stuck to my piece of cake and zoned out a little.

I don't know how much time had past, but the next thing I knew was that there was a scream from my niece and when I looked up, there were no more adults around, my niece had fallen down from a bar stool she had climbed and had a bloody knee (nothing more serious, luckly). When I got to her the other adults rushed in from the balcony a room over. My niece got checked over, got a bandaid and was already playing again 5 min after. But my brother asked me what happend and why I didn't prevent her from climbing. And when I told him I zoned out, he got angry and blamed me for her accident. 

It's a few days later now and I got several messages and calls from family, how irresponsible and asshole-y I am because I was not paying attention to the kids. I thought it wasn't my fault, because I wasn't made aware that I was the only adult left in the room. But I'm beginning to doubt my point of view. Am I the asshole here?",throwaway34578891,2857,293,0.9700000286102296,0.1498338066511209,1704670861,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1916dia/aita_for_not_paying_attention_to_the_kids_at_my/,2024,1,AmItheAsshole,2024-01-07 23:41:01
1ae8c67,AITA For telling my wife I don't want her sister at our house all the time,"My wife (38F) and I (39M) have been married for 12 years and have 3 kids (10, & 7-year-old twins).  About 8-months ago, my wife's sister Ann (29F) went through a pretty traumatic time.  She found out she was pregnant with her long-time BF of 6 years.  It wasn't planned, but that didn't lessen the heartbreak when she lost the pregnancy at 10-weeks.  To make things even worse, her BF left her 2 months later.  Ann lives about 15-minutes from us so obviously we were there to support her with anything she needed.  Neither my wife nor Ann are close to their parents at all so we are pretty much the only family Ann has.  

Ann was understandably heartbroken by what happened and was struggling pretty hard.  My wife was very diligent about making sure Ann didn't do anything stupid when her mental health was struggling so she pretty much included her in everything we did so she could keep an eye on her.  This included turning an extra room in our house into a bedroom for Ann.  The room had previously been a gaming/play room.  

For the past 6-months Ann has been staying at our house 4-5 nights a week.  She still has her own apartment, but she spends the vast majority of her time at our house and is included in pretty much all of our family plans.  

At first, I was understanding and knew my wife wanted to keep a close eye on Ann because she was struggling so bad.  But having another adult in our house pretty much all the time has been wearing on me.  Ann doesn't do much of anything to help around the house and anytime there is a mention of chores or cleaning, she will scoot off back to her apartment with some excuse.  Whenever I bring this up to my wife she will make excuses for Ann and say that she is a ""guest"" so we can't expect her to help around the house.  

Ann is also now very different around our kids.  She used to be a very involved and fun aunt and would babysit for us so we could have date nights.  But now, she refuses to be left alone with the kids for even short periods of time because she says it is bad for her mental health after what happened.  

The other day I asked my wife if she can ask Ann to watch the kids on Valentine's day so we can go out together and she refused and said I should know we can't ask that of her.  It started a fight between us about Ann and I expressed a lot of frustration with how Ann is always at our house and I don't like it.  I made the mistake of saying ""It's been 6-months, how much longer are we going to do this?""  That pissed off my wife and she called me a heartless asshole.  

Before anyone asks, yes Ann is in therapy and from what I can tell she is doing much better emotionally and mentally.  I've never said anything about this to her, but her BF breaking up with her was a blessing.  The guy was a loser and I don't think he would have been a good father.  

I understand my wife feels responsible for Ann, but I also feel like she has a responsibility to keep me happy too.

19e1hra,AITA for confronting my SIL that she was trying to make our wedding a showcase for her kids?,"My husband and I recently got married and I felt that my SIL tried to make our special day about her kids.

  
I proposed to my SIL's kids if they could be our flower girls for the special day. The kids were so excited and said yes! Everything seemed to go according to plan until two months before the wedding when my SIL asked me if the kids should have two dresses for two entrances (wedding ceremony & dinner reception). I told my SIL that the kids will only have one entrance, as our flower girls, during my wedding ceremony. My SIL looked upset and said ""they MUST walk during the dinner reception too."" Note that my wedding ceremony and dinner reception was at the same location and the wedding aisle was long (85ft long) so it takes some time to get from one end to the other (especially for kids).  
  
I am not the confrontational type, so I asked my husband to tell his sister that her daughters will only walk down the aisle once. My husband agreed and told his sister. My SIL disapproved and said to my husband that he is the kids' only beloved uncle and that her daughters will never get a chance to be flower girls again.

  
I thought everything was sorted out... until the big day. The wedding ceremony went as should and the flower girls were so beautiful; however, when the dinner reception time came and my husband and my entrance to the dinner reception was about to happen, the SIL inserted her kids in front of us with fresh baskets of rose petals. The SIL never told me nor my husband about this entrance.

  
I was blindsided. Turns out that my SIL went behind my back and told my MOH to tell the wedding MC (emcee) to announce the flower girls first to the dinner reception. The flower girls entered the dinner reception laying out a fresh set of rose petals down the aisle once more. While I was surprised, I was not angry (nor sad) because it was a special day and I did not want to let bad emotions ruin the day. I was also going to let the MC introduce and thank the flower girls during the reception anyways, so I did not mind.

  
This quickly changed when my SIL planned a surprise dance by the daughters in the middle of dinner as a gift to us. The MC once again announced the flower girls and they started dancing down the aisle onto the main stage again. So, all in all the kids ""walked"" down the aisle not once, not twice, but three times! My husband and I were supposed to have our first dance during this time, but instead her daughters danced on the stage, while my husband and I had our first dance on the side...

  
After the wedding I told my husband how upset I was at his sister and said she was trying to make the day about her kids. I confronted my SIL about this, but she shrugged it off and said that they were just kids and I am being a bridezilla/an a-hole. Instead my husband apologized on her behalf, which angered me more since it was not his fault.

19a2vih,AITA For Trying to Show My Houseguest How It Feels When She's Constantly Whale Tailing?,"okay, so i'm a stay at home mom, 36. We thought it would be a nice experience to host an exchange student, so a person from argentina has been staying with us. For the most part, things have gone great. She's in her sophomore year at a university nearby, and so she usually gets back from classes around the time my sons get home from school and we'll have dinner together, maybe do some tourism stuff on the weekends.

There's just one problem. one very awkward problem. For whatever reason, she doesn't seem to wear pants that fit her. That's the polite way of saying that her thong is always hanging out. I'm talking like manny santos levels of whale tail going on. I had no idea that it was back in trend, I had thought I had left those treacherous days behind me, but apparently it's back with a vengeance.

and just to be clear, I don't mean that her underwear is visible every once in a while when she bends over. I mean that her thong is right there, every time we get dinner in a resteraunt, or go golfing, or meet friends.
This places me in a pretty awkward position. she's 18, and she's not my kid, and it's against my general moral compass to tell other adults how to dress. however, I'm awfully tired of looking at a random persons bum floss in my own home.

I did try talking with her about it, but she brushes it off as if it was just an accident. 10 of 15 minutes later, I see her casually lift the band of her underwear so that it's back to being above her pants.

So, here's what I did about it. I needed to go run some errands and give her a ride to the the post office. Only, as soon as we arrived at the grocery store, her eyes went wide when I stepped out of the car. In the back of my drawer, I had found the loudest most bedazzled thong that I owned, and was wearing it a proud several inches above my own pants. I knew that the best way to make it uncool would be to adopt it myself.

I could see her dying inside, but I pretended not to notice and told her how seeing her thong made me remember back to the 90s, how it was so cute and I was inspired to try it again, how fun it would be to whale tail together etc etc. Needless to say, she didn't say very much for the rest of the evening. If her thong wasn't out of her pants, I would act pouty and tell her that it would be fun if we were matching. 

Since then, she's been really stand offish with me, to the point that other family members have noticed (nobody but me knows about my little prank). It's making me start to wonder if perhaps it was too far.

199a6r5,AITA Telling my roommate her boyfriend can't visit her,"I am a freshman in college and got randomly assigned with my roommate. In the first semester her long distance boyfriend, who is 4 years older then us, came to visit twice. Once when I was away for the weekend and once during a break when I went home. Both times he stayed a day longer then I was away. The first time this happened I slept in my own bed sharing a room with them. The second time my roommate asked if I could give them alone time and I slept on my friends floor.

Recently she asked if I would be traveling this month and I said no. She informed me that she was hoping for her boyfriend to come visit and stay in our dorm room for 3 nights as hotels are expensive. I told her that I did't feel comfortable sharing a room with them for 3 days and didn't want to sleep on my friends floor again. She said that her friend has an air mattress I could borrow and I told her I didn't want sleep on a random persons air mattress nor did I want to impose on my friend and her roommates room for 3 days especially as she wanted him to come during a time when I have exams and need my room to study. I asked her if it would be possible for her to wait till spring break to see him or to visit him as he has his own apartment rather then him come here. She said she really wanted him to come here. And I repeated that I didn't want him to come. She then left the room.

When she returned it looked like she had cried and she told me that it makes her very sad when she can't see him for a long time and that I'm not letting her see him and that if my long distance bf came to visit she would gladly sleep in someone else's room.

1af13u3,"AITA for refusing to ""cover up"" in my own house?","I (f19) am fairly well-endowed. I have a size 40D chest that is pretty difficult to hide unless I layer.

This morning I walked out of my room in a 
tank top with no bra underneath. The tank top had one of those ""built-in"" shelf bras, but that is certainly not supportive enough for me, and my boobs don't defy gravity, of course. So, I had a lot of cleavage showing.

My mom (f50) was the first person I saw when I walked into the kitchen, and directly after saying hello to me, she added, ""you need to go put on a shirt, your dad is home and you have way too much showing."" I replied with ""I *have* a shirt on,"" and then changed the topic to food, since she was looking through the fridge.

We sat down to share a big sandwich, and at that moment my brother (m16) got home from school. He took a piece of the sandwich and started eating, hardly even looking in mine or my mother's direction. My mom repeated again, ""you *seriously* need to go cover up, you are way too obvious. Go put a shirt on.""

Again, I said, ""I have a shirt on."" She said, ""it's not covering you enough."" I said, ""yes it is, I'm sitting in the privacy of my own house."" She said, ""it's not *your* house, your male relatives are around."" I said, ""my male relatives shouldn't be looking at me in that way."" (Mind you, my father was nowhere to be seen and my brother was silent.)

She got up from the table in a huff, rambling angrily as she put things back in the kitchen. She said that I am disrespectful and insinuated that I think I know everything because I am a legal adult. She ended her monologue with, ""get a clue about the real world."" 

I didn't say anything to that, because I was confused. The real world? We are not talking about walking around in public, we are talking about sitting at home in comfortable clothes.

She was still standing in the kitchen when I went to put my plate away, and as I washed it, she said, ""you know, that's like if your brother was sitting in the living room with his testicles hanging out of his shorts, refusing to cover himself because it's 'his house.'"" I started to say that I am certainly not exposing my genitals, but I couldn't get more than two words out before she said, ""no. No. You want to be disrespectful, don't talk to me."" She headed downstairs and I went to my room.

The thing is, my chest size did not magically happen. I had to get these genes from *somewhere,* and that somewhere is my mom! Hers are even bigger than mine, and absolutely nobody makes a fuss when she sits at the dining table with no bra under her tank top. Because there's no sane reason to. 

My opinion: sexualizing your family's bodies by telling them to cover up, lest their father/brother/son state? That is weird. I should be able to be physically comfortable in my own house. But this isn't the first time she has said something like this, so am I the asshole?",WolfAndAHalf,1188,712,0.8500000238418579,0.1153286758179433,1706652997,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1af13u3/aita_for_refusing_to_cover_up_in_my_own_house/,2024,1,AmItheAsshole,2024-01-30 22:16:37
190ccru,AITA for telling my boyfriend he deserved to get humbled.,"I (18F) and my boyfriend (19M) have been dating since we started college in October 2021. For the past I’d say 8 months my bf has become very interested in UFC (mma? idk what to call it). He gets up at like 3AM to watch fights and often has play fights with his friends one of these friends are important in this situation (I’ll call him S). We had a very large group of friends,we all graduated in summer but we all kept in touch over summer until now. Now these play fights or “spars” as my bf would say were all fun and games but they actually led my bf to believe he could actually fight because S (who says he does mma) said he’s naturally good. 

This led to a massive ego and he said he wanted to have a actual fight, and one of our other friends dad owned a gym with ring and he said he could let him fight there (idk if that was even legal). S proposed a guy for him to fight and it was a guy back from school I’ll call A. S was friends with A(not close friends) and I knew A because we used to sit next to each other in class. S said he’ll try get a hold of him. A agreed, shockingly. 

When A agreed I did express some concern to my bf (multiple times) and he didn’t listen. A was a quiet guy, but as we sat next to each other for a year I knew probably more than others about him, he was pretty much just one of those traditional masculine males in a physical sense, worked out 6 days a week, rode horses and did archery, owned large dogs but was one of those guys that looked intimidating but was actually a nerdy and friendly guy. My bf didn’t like A or A’s friends, and neither did the rest of the boys in our friends group. I always questioned my bf on this as A had literally never even spoken to him, and my bf used to say it’s because A is so arrogant and thinks he’s so good looking, this led to a lot of arguments with my bf, because why did my bf care if other women were attracted to A when he had me?

Nobody knew if A could fight but S said he told him something about he had been training in some form of martial arts. The whole build up to this my bf was acting so childish, he’d constantly try insult A in a group chat that was made and A wouldn’t even open them 90% of the time and I dont think he responded once. When the fight came along there was only one outcome from the start,  A was visibly towering over my bf, and he had clearly bulked up. On top of that, turned out he could fight, my bf lost in i’d say 90 seconds. 

After it I didn’t bother consoling him, I berated him because I expressed my concern multiple times and he picked not to listen to me.

1958726,AITA for refusing to eat my food because my aunt put stuff on it,"My aunt lives pretty far away and my parents and I were staying with her, my uncle and 2 cousins for a week. They’re like really obsessed with eating healthy food so they only have organic stuff and like no sugar. They also live in the countryside and there’s only one little shop near them to get food from (unless you order online which is what they do.) I’m autistic and there’s a lot of food i don’t like. I’m not picky or anything and i still eat healthy stuff but i just hate a lot of foods too.

My aunt had nothing that i like eating (apart from a few little things) so i mainly just had pot noodles from the shop (they didn’t sell much i like either) but i don’t mind because pot noodles are my favourite food because they always taste the same they never change it’s great.

My aunt offered to make me a pot noodle because i was looking after my cousins when i went to eat it though she’d put lettuce and peppers and stuff in it. Basically making it into a salad. I don’t hate salad i just don’t want it in my noodles it ruins it and it makes it taste different and ew. I told her i’m not eating it and i got kinda upset at her for messing with it. She told me that i was being unreasonable and she was just trying to make me something healthier. My parents agree with her and said i should apologise.

196u0uv,AITA for telling my sister and her family to leave my house after my sister started to curse at me,"AITA for telling my sister and her family to leave my house after my sister started to curse at me.

My sister, her husband, and my niece come to my house almost every weekend. This weekend, my daughter had committed to my niece to help her put together a lego set. They arrived at our house and when they came in my daughter was playing a game, my niece was eating some dinner they’d brought for her and my sister was eating but also was clearly expressing some anger/frustration with her husband who was in the family room playing video games with my husband. This was the plan all along— for our husbands to play games and my daughter and niece to build legos. It was super early in the night (maybe 5:30/6ish) so there was a lot of time for everyone to get to everything because they are usually here until 10:30 or 11 on a weekend. 

My niece finishes her food and my sister was fussing. I actually said to my husband I may leave and run some errands because I don’t like the energy in here. I packed up the food my niece didn’t finish and put it in a bag for her. My niece starts to open the legos. She’s 7 and capable to start this task—- we were letting her do her thing. My daughter was still playing her game. 

My sister says “Sarah, are you going to get up? Jane is opening everything and she’s ready.” Sarah responded that she was coming in just a bit. My sister goes in and starts helping my niece and says “well now you need some scissors. I thought the teen almost young adult was going to get up and help you”. 

This is when I chimed in with, “Sarah doesn’t have to hop up just because Jane is done eating and ready. She will be in in just a minute” and I put the pair of scissors on the table. 

After about 3-4 minutes Sarah goes in and starts helping. My sister is on the phone and grumbling about something else and then says “oh Sarah it’s okay I don’t want your mom to think I’m forcing you to come help”. 

I respond, “hey that’s not really necessary” and try to explain that I was just saying they both could be patient while Sarah finished what she was doing. My sister cuts me off and I say “listen whatever you’re upset about you don’t need to take it out on me.”

She proceeds to start yelling and cursing at me. Telling me I need to shut the fuck up and I really need to not take this to another level because she’s already not in the mood and she about to “go there” with me. 

Without yelling I say, “you need to go. You gotta go home.”  

She says fine and said “I didn’t want to come over here today anyway.” I didn’t say anything and let them leave. 

Later my husband says “you and your sister ruined us(him and my brother in law) hanging out.” I asked okay but was I wrong? I don’t think anyone should be able to come in my home and disrupt my peace because they are in a bad mood. 

My husband responded “you don’t put family out of your house”.

1961ihz,AITA for prioritizing my mother’s feelings over my wife’s disdain?,"AITA for prioritizing my mother’s feelings over my wife’s disdain.

My father died unexpectedly in an accident last year. He was only 50. 

My wife (30) has had issues with my mom for the past 3 years. While we were dating, my mom made the comment that she didn’t feel we were “right for each other”. Since then, there has been a heaviness around them. Mom has apologized and always says I love you. But my wife hasn’t really accepted and has not ever said “I love you back”. She doesn’t accept the apology and thinks it only came after we were married because she had “no choice but to accept [her].”

Fast forward: my wife and I move 20 minutes from my mom after my dad dies due to a job change. Tonight, my siblings made plans for the family to eat dinner in the city- about 1.5 hours away. The weather’s a little dicey, so my mom called and asked if we could ride together. She could meet at our apartment, and then we could drive into the city together. 

My wife told me to tell her “no” and that she’s a grown woman and can drive herself. That giving her a ride we are enabling her “helplessness”. My father did everything for my mom including driving through bad weather and into the city. 

My wife and I got into it and I told her we are giving my widowed mother a ride to see her kids and grandkids.

1af24np,"AITA for ""keeping score"" with my family and ruining dinner?","I (27m) am the 3rd of 4 siblings and have always felt like an afterthought. Laurie (33f), Chuck (29m), and Jade (25f) have always gotten the first and best from my parents and each other. I get the leftovers if I'm lucky. I haven't gotten a birthday present from any of my siblings in about 10 years, but I still get asked to pitch in for group gifts for each of them every year.

On Friday night we were having a family dinner and it honestly felt like every other sentence was a dig at me or a less than subtle brag by my siblings about something they have been given by my parents that I was denied.  They talked about how nice almost all of our weddings were, but made sure to mention it was ""ok"" that my wife and I had a small low-key wedding. And it was Ok, we loved it. But they brushed over the fact that my parents paid for all of my siblings weddings... but not mine. Because somehow they couldn't afford it... because they were saving up for Jade's wedding.

​They brought up how little student loans they have… because my parents helped them. All of them lived on campus at expensive 4 year schools. I lived at home and went first to a (very prestigious, very hard to get into) watchmaking school. I got paid to attend this school… so I paid rent at home. My parents paid for my tools. And I appreciate the help. I really do. But they paid 120-150k each for my siblings... they gave me 7k for tools. But to them it’s equal. When I went back to school on my own I didn’t ask for money and wasn’t offered it. When my brother went back to school they covered EVERYTHING without him even having to ask.

There were many other small moments (comments about cars and other lifestyle choices) but what made me snap was my brother and his wife mentioning their marriage being so great because they do things like spontaneous dates, like the one they had the prior Friday night. The Friday night where my parents called my wife and I last minute to cancel plans they had to eat dinner at our house because they had to watch Chuck's kids because of an ""emergency"". Turns out that ""emergency"" was a dinner for Chuck and my SIL at Texas Roadhouse. I had spent HOURS making my grandpa's ziti and meatballs with homemade marinara because its my mom's favorite. 

I wanted more than anything to scream at them but instead I got up and left without saying a word and my wife followed me. when my mom called me later to ask why I left I just explained exactly why. I explained the favoritism, the unfairness, and the fact that it doesn't feel like they care about me. She didn't say much and I wasn't really looking for an explanation or an apology in the moment, I just felt like it was self evident but if she really didn't see it I'd spell it out. Evidently at least parts of what I said have been shared with my siblings because now Chuck and Laurie are furious at me and saying I ruined dinner and my mom is upset that I am hurt. They say I'm immature for ""keeping score""

1adfrs7,AITA For not wanting to claim this child as my (half) sibling,"Alright so I, 20M, have 4 siblings (T 22, N 17, D 6 and M 3, all F). D and M are half siblings from my dad’s second marriage , but T, N and I all regard these two kids as our sisters, and we don’t care about the “half” aspect of it. 

Important information before continuing. 

1. My mum is still alive. Parents split around 8 years ago. Dad was unfaithful and manipulative so mum left with the kids. He is also a narcissist. 
2. I have a good relationship with dad’s wife. She’s a great mother to my sisters. They live together and I video call them very often. When we’re in the same city, we’re always hanging out with these kids. 
3. Contact with my dad is very very low. 
4. Dad didn’t pay child support for us…mum did it herself. 
5. T and I left for college three years ago and three months ago respectively. 
6. We’ve known about the unborn love child for 6 months, but he only told us about it in the last 24 hours. 

Here’s the mess. 

Dad had an affair with some new (married) woman. Don’t know who she is (dgaf either). He is still married to my step mother, but there have been murmurs that she may leave with the two girls. He’s essentially broken up the marriage again, in the same way he broke his first marriage. He wants his kids to have a relationship with this new child, and we’re all refusing, as this child is the product of his affair with another married woman. While we weren’t thrilled about our parents’ divorce, we accepted his wife and their kids as our little sisters. We have solid relationships with them. His justification for his affair is that he “didn’t plan it” and that it “wasn’t meant to happen”. He doesn’t want this child to grow up without his “family”. He claims his wife is gonna raise the baby with him and his AP gonna give up parental rights (we know it’s bullshit.) He also claims his wife was cool with the matter (also bullshit). 

We have told him that we don’t want anything to do with his love child or his affair partner and that they have no place claiming siblinghood or any sort of family status, given that he wasn’t supposed to be fucking other women since he’s married. He wishes for this kid to have the same privileges that my youngest two sisters have (we take them out, we spoil them, etc) but this kid won’t get those perks. That’s his mess.

After we left the diner, my gf screamed at me for being a ""giant piece of shit,"" for not only not doing the right thing myself but also not letting her do it.

19e1en8,AITA For going on holiday with my grandchildren and without my daughters partners children?,"My daughter, Alice, has two children, one is with her current partner, Liam. He has three children from a previous relationship.

To celebrate my youngest child’s 21st birthday,  I was planning a surprise holiday for us all to Disneyland. I found a great flight deal and was keen to get it booked. Prior to booking the holiday I spoke to Liam on the phone I told him my plan and asked him about his three children from the previous relationship coming. It was decided he’d speak to their mother, who is a very difficult character, to ask her permission. I booked the flight deal for 5, resigned to the fact that the flight cost would increase for the remaining 4 flights. 

The flights are over the Easter holiday, and Liams Ex has said the children cannot come. She wants to do an egg hunt with them. Liam wants to move the holiday to suit his ex. The dates suit my daughter whose 21st Birthday we are celebrating, and of course the cheap flight deal is a factor also.

This has all backfired onto me because Liam is disappointed they can’t go, he says the other two shouldn’t go. He claims I am not treating the family the same, and has completely overlooked the conversation I had with him before booking, and the subsequent messages I have sent regarding an update on the booking.

What should have been a lovely surprise for everyone has been ruined by Liams fury at his ex partner.

So am I the asshole for booking the deal flights for my children and grandchildren and not waiting for response from his ex about their three children?

1b2kw13,AITA for telling my mom I will move out vs paying $600 a month rent?,"I'm 25 years old, was paying $60 a week rent for a few years. I recently started a new temp job that pays pretty decent, and they decided to keep me with the company last week. This morning my mom texted me to say “Rent starts up again, $150 a week”. 

I just told her I will move out. I already pay for my own meals, I only have my small bedroom to call my own in their house. I can rent a studio apartment 3 or 4 times the size of my room for a few hundred more, or could rent a room with friends for less than my mom is trying to charge me. It would be one thing if they cooked and cleaned for me every day and I was raking up their bills but I do my own thing, pay my own bills, I never really even cross paths with my parents besides when I am getting off work. 

My moms definitely pissed that I said that, I can tell. But I'm also upset the person who birthed me is trying to get me to pay what I would pay a landlord for rent just to sleep in her house.  Even 100 a week I would have been more inclined to be okay with, but 600 a month just to be able to sleep at my parents house seems a little high. If I am paying $600 a month I think I would deserve my own spaces around the house also as I would with a landlord, it seems having a landlord would be a better deal for me in this case.

1agotpu,AITA for saying “you should’ve thought about that before you procreated”?,"My ex and I have a 13 year old daughter, “Nicole”. Nicole has several medical conditions that require a lot of attention. She will need some sort of in home assistance for the rest of her life. While we have an aide to help a couple of days a week, it is still a challenge. The outcome of Nicole’s condition became clear when she was 2. At that point, my ex and I agreed we wouldn’t have more kids because it wouldn’t be fair to anyone. There’d be no way we could focus attention on two kids. Someone would lose out in this situation.

We divorced when Nicole was 5. We originally had 50/50 custody. 3 years later, my ex remarried. His new wife, Callie, is nice. My ex did say that she didn’t understand the severity of Nicole’s condition . I figured there was a learning curve. Eventually, Callie basically said she wanted to be hands off. Which I respected, though I wondered how it’d work considering Nicole lives with them half the time. 

Last year, my ex and Callie had a baby. I was a little surprised given my ex was always firm on not having more kids but figured it wasn’t any of my business. He did begin to complain that it was a lot of work juggling Nicole and the baby. I sympathized but really didn’t know what else to say.

Recently, the venting got worse. He said Callie yelled at him for taking Nicole to her physical therapy appointment instead of helping her with the baby. He brought up potentially having Nicole stay with me more. I wasn’t entirely shocked but it pissed me off. I said Nicole was his daughter. He can’t just abandon that responsibility. He asked what he was supposed to do about the baby. 

I said “maybe you should’ve thought of that before you procreated? I mean, really, we discussed this 10 years ago as to why it’d be hard to juggle two kids. Why did you think having another would be a good idea?” He got quiet and said Callie wanted a baby. I said that isn’t enough of a reason and maybe he should’ve thought harder before bringing more life into this world. 

The conversation ended with me saying I’d call my lawyer and we could arrange for him to have less custody as I’d rather my daughter be properly cared for than be viewed as a burden.

Callie called me that night very upset that I had made my ex cry and that I said her baby shouldn’t exist. I said that’s not what I said completely, more that they didn’t think it through. She called me a jerk.

1b01blt,AITA for ordering food that my husband can’t eat?,"I 28f have been with my husband 28m for 9 years, married for 2 this summer. We have a daughter who is 7 years. We rarely even fight, and if we do it has been more major and serious things, but this, what to me was a small issue is now turning into the biggest argument we have ever had.

So the problem is that me and our daughter loves LOVES spicy food, I always have and ever since I felt comfortable with her trying it, she has loved it too. Sure we couldn’t compete in a spice eating contest and even though our tolerance is high, it is not extreme. But my husband, he hates it, he is one of those people who thinks spice is unnecessary and only likes to use salt and pepper. This is not a problem, sometimes I make a batch that suits his taste, another one for me and our daughter. Sometimes me and our daughter will just eat how it is to his liking, as too little spices is easier to handle than to much as it would be for him. 

Now this Saturday he was away with friends to go pick up some car parts, it was a 12 hour drive in total, and they left at about 9. I went ahead and ordered from a Indian place that our daughter has as her favorite, my husband also likes this place and just orders something mild when we eat from there. Since my husband was not home, I did not order him anything as I thought that they would’ve eaten on the road. When he got home, he greeted us then immediately went to the fridge and saw some boxes left of food. When he opened them, he obviously noticed he could not eat any of them.

Now we argued just for about 5 minutes of this, the consensus of the argument was him saying that I should’ve either thought about him and ordered him something, or I should’ve asked him if he had eaten or wanted anything. I argued that I would’ve probably done so if it was just for a few hours he was away, but he was away for over 12 hours and came home about 4 hours after we usually eat, so I assumed he had eaten. 

Now he has barely talked, he cooked his dinner for himself because in his words “I can’t be bothered”, he texted me from the living room when I was cooking for me and our daughter that he hoped I was happy to have my food my way now. He is extremely weird about this, he has never ever acted this way about something like this and I am getting even more confused by it all.

Before my birthday, five of my friends asked if I would like to get some food and drinks out for my birthday event. I said sure where would we go Mike said ""Anywhere you like"".  
I suggested a nearby Steakhouse that I have been to in the past.  


We all met each other there, Mike was quick to order himself a drink and started talking about appetizers. I said I don't normally eat them but I will try one.  
We ordered our mains and we all had ordered the steak and another round of drinks at which point Adam also ordered a bottle of champagne. I said you guys don't need to get me Champagne it's only my birthday nothing too special when Mike said ""Lighten up birthday boy have some fun"" I did think maybe I was being too uptight and since I was being treated it's not too big of a problem I may as well celebrate.  


Mike started arguing with the table next to us because they threw a french fry at him. I tried to explain to him that they weren't even eating french fries he had them earlier and must have dropped one. Then he stood up and started swearing at the table. there was a child at the table about 3 years old who looked absolutely shocked. I told Mike to sit down and he started pushing me saying ""That man threw something at me"" The waiter came over and said there had been complaints against us. 

Mike just silently drank his beer and Adam started arguing with the waiter saying the other table started it. The waiter said we needed to pay up and leave in the next few minutes before there was a problem. 

I said ""Thanks guys do you want me to help pay"" At which point they all looked at me and Adam said ""You're the birthday man right? you got money"" I said ""I thought you were inviting me because it's my birthday as a present"" Adam chuckled a bit and said, ""Weren't you the one that chose where we were going bud?"" 

Adam got up to leave and said ""Let's go boys"" I started to worry I thought they were pranking me or something and said ""You can't really go"" Then Adam started to walk away So I grabbed him a bit and he looked at my hand and said  ""Get your hand off me pal"" I just looked at him and said, ""Why are you acting like this man?"" They walked out and left me with the bill.

 I tried to explain to the waiter about the situation. He said ""Someone's gotta pay and your table was causing a lot of trouble tonight"" I tried to apologise but he just looked at me like I was dirt. So I just paid it was most of my money.

 I spoke to my friends after and they just acted like nothing happened I said ""You guys need to pay me back"" and I got several replies along the lines of It's already over leave it. 

&#x200B;

So I haven't spoken to them in a few days I received a few messages asking me if ""I am still crying"" or if ""I grew up yet?"" I haven't replied and I want to know if I was wrong to assume that I wouldn't be paying.

1alg5zg,AITA for asking my boyfriend to skip his afternoon nap.,"I'm 26F, hes 30M. We've been dating for 3 years but just moved in together 6 years ago. 

I have felt crazy busy since moving in together. I work outside of the house, commute for an hour a day, and I'm going to school part time to try and get a better job, so my schedule is already packed, but since moving in together it feels like my time spent doing chores has almost doubled. 

I talked with my boyfriend about this hoping that we could come up with a reasonable chore schedule, but hes adamant that hes doing as much as he has the capacity to do. 

Something else I've noticed since moving in together is that he takes a nap from 4pm-8pm daily. He otherwise sleeps through the night usually 1am-10am, but that afternoon nap is like clockwork.

Long story short, I told him that he is getting 14-15 hours of sleep every day, and that he can start making more time to help around the house by even shortening that nap. I dont even think that amount of sleep it healthy. But he insists its a necessary part of his day and that im crossing a boundary by suggested that he not nap.

1b1oo52,AITA for 'taking up all the attention' at my SIL's baby shower?,"I (33F) am an OB/GYN and I've been travelling around different parts of the world on missions with MSF. Long story short, I hadn't been home in 15 months.  (For some context, I decided to join due to a depressive episode after my ex-girlfriend broke up with me but I ended up loving it and I just kept going on missions for 15 months. My ex-girlfriend is a good friend of my sister in law, Penny.) 

I decided to take some time off and come back for a while before deciding on what's next for me. I returned 2 weeks ago. My brother (I'll call him Harry - 34M) and his wife (Penny - 28F) are expecing their first child. They had scheduled a baby shower for yesterday, and obviously Penny invited me.

Family members and some of Harry's old friends and were asking me questions about different missions ans why I left for charity while I could earn a fortune here, was it hard being a woman in those areas etc. I gave them short answers but they asked more questions.

Penny subtly asked for me to talk one-on-one in the middle of the party. She told me I was monopolizing everyone's attention and taking up everyone's time and no one was paying attention to the purpose of this gathering due to my being there. 

I apologized and asked her if she wanted me to leave. She said I had been enough of a distraction, and told me to please leave early. I left about half an hour after this talk. So far everything's good. 

The next day Harry called me and told me I had been a rude guest the day before, because I had ruined their first child's baby shower. He said I should have kept quiet or at the very least left the party the moment Penny asked me to. Was I a. AH?

1agpmqm,AITA for telling my SIL/best friend that she overshadowed my wedding?,"Burner account. I(29F) am married to ""Nate""(29M) and his sister his ""Denise""(29F) we are all childhood friends and I married Nate almost a year ago. Denise, at the time was 7 months pregnant with her first child, her husband is ""Wayne""(30M). Not too long after our reception started, Denise went into preterm labor. Her pregnancy up until that point was not high risk so this was completely out of nowhere and stunned all of us. She understandably had to leave with Wayne to the hospital and most of their side of the family left out of concern. She insisted we stay and have fun and lord knows Nate and I tried but knowing that she was in unexpected, high risk labor was at the forefront of our minds and we made the difficult decision to end the reception about  an hour and a half early and joined up at the hospital.

My nephew ""Ben"" was born that night and we were all excited but I'll admit Nate and I felt a bit miffed that our wedding day was kind of stolen by this event. We kept this to ourselves though, as this was obviously unplanned and it's cruel to put that on Denise and Wayne. But, from that point on nobody ever talked about our marriage, just baby Ben. The times I think a relative mentioned our wedding can be counted on one hand. I get it, new additions to the family are ultimately more important but my wedding day will never just be about my wedding, it'll be about Ben, and whenever he comes up  or I see him I feel bitter because I'm reminded of what happened at the wedding. Yes, I know I'm jealous of a baby. I feel like shit for it. Nate was like this too for a while but grew out of it, I'm still working on it.

Ben is turning 1 in 2 weeks and that's all everyone's talking about, not a peep about our anniversary. I already know I'll just be depressed and mopey the whole time so I asked if Nate could politely tell him I would not be there. He did and Denise was pretty upset and demanded to know why, he refused, so she confronted me via text. She told me that she's picked up on how I seem sad whenever Ben is mentioned and said I'm hurting her that I can't tell her why. I decided to be honest and tell her that I've been very depressed(not just for this issue, but it's contributing) and that I felt that my wedding was overshadowed by her unexpected labor. I did tell her I'm not mad at anyone because it was unplanned, I just need to not be reminded of it on my anniversary. She did not respond and just blocked me, but Wayne uninvited Nate and told him to keep him and I far away from his family. Nate's confused and I feel like shit. AITA?

1b0wndk,AITA for Asking My Niece to Stop Speaking French Around My Dyslexic Wife?,"My wife (28F) Sarah and I (M30) have been married for five years. She's incredible, loving, and my favourite person in the world. Now, my entire family has tradition of learning and speaking French. It's always been a fun way for us to bond. However, for Sarah, it's been a bit of a challenge.

Sarah has tried for years to pick up the language, but due to her dyslexia, she's found it extremely difficult. It's been a great source of frustration and insecurity for her, especially when we're around my family who like to speak French with each other.

My niece (17F), Eva, is staying with us for a while. She's speaks English and French too, and understandably speaks a lot of French around the house. While I understand its just a normal thing for her, it's been a bit upsetting for Sarah. She feels excluded from our conversations and she's started trying to brush up on it but its just stressing her out and hitting a nerve.

Given the situation, I approached Eva and asked if she could try to speak more English around my wife. I explained that it wasn't about controlling her choices but about helping Sarah feel more comfortable and included in conversations.

Unfortunately, Eva didn't take it well. She accused me of prioritizing Sarah's difficulties over her comfort and claimed that I was asking her to suppress her identity.

I'm not sure if I handled it the right way. AITA for asking Eva to stop speaking French around Sarah?",ThrowRA_mmh,4286,1681,0.9100000262260436,0.3499627656902649,1708990701,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1b0wndk/aita_for_asking_my_niece_to_stop_speaking_french/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-26 23:38:21

My bio mom lives about 5 miles away with her husband and their kids (12f and 8m). I don't live with her, never have, and probably never will. I visit her sometimes, like once a month, but we both know she's not my mom. I've called her by her first name since I was like 5. I don't have a room or a bed at her house and there's no pictures of me in there. 

My bio mom talked me into going to some family party with her and her family. I don't know anyone there so I was mostly just hanging out with her while I was there. She started talking about how I never see her and it took an act of god to get me to go to this party so I told her to show them my room. She tried to show them her daughter's room so I said ""no, that's Amanda's room, see the A by her bed?"" and she was out of rooms after that because it's only a 2 bedroom house. She pulled me aside and said to stop and that I was making her look bad so we went back and I told her siblings that I wasn't allowed to talk about not having a bed at her house anymore because it makes her look bad. 

Apparently that wasn't good enough either because she tried telling me to give her my phone. I reminded her that she's not my mom then called my mom and told her to pick me up. 

My mom picked me up and she's really mad at my bio mom for all of this but my dad says it sucks but I should've taken it since im probably never gonna see these people again. im not in trouble but they can't agree whether I was right or wrong so I wanted to know if I was the ass",biomombedroom,7571,527,0.9700000286102296,0.3470545090256602,1707690237,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1aokcnh/aita_for_telling_my_bio_moms_family_that_i_dont/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-11 22:23:57
1ahh5yk,"AITA for not ""just dropping it"" and putting a blanket veto on all TV show names for our son?","Me and my wife are having our first kid soon and know it is going to be a boy. It's been hard to come to an agreement on names—she is very firm on picking a name that we both agree on, but we pretty much have opposite taste. I have a very very basic and common first name, which I like, so I gravitate towards simple and classic names like James, William, and Daniel. She likes...not that.

She suggested the name Dean the other day and I was considering it, until I found out she picked it because it was the name of her teen TV crush. She dug in her heels and insisted that she just liked the name and wasn't gonna name her kid *after* the character, and watching an old episode of the show just reminded her of the name. I'm like...that is *exactly* what ""naming your kid after a TV character"" means. 

So I said how about this, I am gonna give you a preemptive blanket veto on TV show names. I don't want to hear suggestions for a little Zuko or Sherlock or anything like that, and literally any other name is on the table. Is that fair? And she said ""NO"" that is not fair and I'm being a dick and putting words in her mouth. My position is that if you're gonna try to pick a TV name for your own kid, at least own up to it and admit it's a TV name. I'm more annoyed at the transparent denial at this point than the fact that she suggested it in the first place.",RohanMars,2076,2313,0.800000011920929,0.3358936427269061,1706915401,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ahh5yk/aita_for_not_just_dropping_it_and_putting_a/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-02 23:10:01

The guest list also included my daughter (Sarah - 24) and her wife (Elizabeth - 28F). Elizabeth works in a demanding, stressful but well compensated corporate position. She does have a tendency of overworking herself.

Unsurprisingly, she was late to the dinner. Sarah said Beth had cleared her schedule for the day but there was a last minute issue and she had to leave for work. Elizabeth made it while everyone else was starting dessert. She apologized, gave us a fancy bottle of wine as a gift and sat down.

We were all done and ready to go but Elizabeth hadn't fully eaten yet. It was getting late so as people started leaving, my husband and I also decided to leave as it was getting late. We didn't wait for Elizabeth to finish her dinner.

The next day I got a call from Sarah saying it was not okay for us to just leave them by themselves like that. I explained and said that it was getting late but she insistes we should have stayed.

We recently got our first home and are officially homeowners so a few weeks ago we decided to throw a big party with family and friends. We did have a bunch of alcohol drinks and mixed drinks, but I had them separated bc my SIL is 3 months pregnant. 

My SIL has had 4 miscarriages in the past. It’s heart wrenching, and I feel horrible for her. I’ve always been supportive.  She has a form of PCOS.  Anyways at the party I had told SIL that the non alcohol drinks were in the indoor fridge, and to feel free to make herself virgin drinks if she liked. On the table outside I had mixed drinks outside and in the outside cooler. Long short short  sister in law ended up getting trashed, a week later miscarried. She’s been blaming my husband and I since early January for this. Sending us hateful messages spamming my phone, saying one of us must’ve mixed up the drinks (which didn’t happen.) When it first occurred I told her I was so sorry, but it wasn’t our fault we had other guest who were drinking and I had made her aware of where the other drinks were.

Two days ago she tried pulling that stuff again when we ran into her while at my MIL, and again said it and followed me through the house arguing with me. I finally blew and said your the stupid one for A)not listening when I told you where the non alcoholic drinks are, B) for continuing to drink bc she had to of realized she was getting drunk, and C) bc your already prone to miscarriages due to your conditions this isn’t our fault.

She broke down in tears crying and wailing saying I wasn’t sensitive, I was a horrible person. My MIL asked us to leave. My husband and I feel bad for her miscarrying ofc, but she has been harassing us for weeks.

1ayf6xz,AITA for not helping my wife around the house?,"I (M36) and my wife (F38) have been married for 8 years and we have two kids (M7) and (F5). She is a stay at home mom, in charge of all the housework and childrearing while I work and cover us financially. Before you start attacking me, hear me out. We ran into a bit of bad luck with debt a few years ago and as a result, on average I work 50-60 hour weeks to help get us out of it. I am a carpenter so the days are long and sometimes I drive quite a bit to get to the work sites. By the time I get home, I am exhausted and pretty much eat then collapse into bed.

On saturdays I take my son and daughter out to his soccer games then back home for lunch, while my wife goes to bookclub, lunch with her friends then usually some sort of hike or yoga class. She is back by mid-afternoon at which point she takes back over the kids and I make dinner, maybe do a bit of laundry and clean the floors. On sundays it is reversed. I go out with my mates, by mid afternoon, I return, we have our baby sitter come around and we spend the night together. 

Recently my wife has come to me saying that I need to start doing more around the house. That I need to do more cleaning, organising, looking after the kids, grocery shopping, cooking. I know that she does a lot and I am in no way saying she doesn’t deserve a break, but I am working really hard too. Especially at the moment. I feel like I do the best I can with how much work I’m doing. I know there is a lot in social media right now about men not doing enough at home, but I never thought I was one of those guys. 

I explained this to her and she said I was being ridiculous. That I spend all day having fun at work with my workmates, while she deals with the children and all of the house chores. Then I get home and just eat and go to bed. This isn’t the plan for forever, but I thought it was going alright for now.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: my son is in school full time and my daughter is a daycare 2 days a week, starting school this year

EDIT: just adding in my comment since lots of people are asking. I look everything to do with my my sons sports stuff aside from driving him to Wednesday practice since I’m at work, same with my daughters swimming lessons. On those Saturday’s I make lists of groceries I think need to be picked up (though admittedly she decides what she wants to cook so has the final say), I go round and empty the laundry baskets/pick up stuff and wash/dry/fold them. I make the Saturday dinner (which is my job to plan and put stuff on the list for). I take care of all the bills, car payments, insurance dates. 

I do ask my wife before I go to bed if she needs anything else done before I crash, which yes I get the mental load thing but I figured if she needed extra help she’d ask, usually she says no. I guess in the mornings I could start making my sons school lunch while I make mine and also my daughters when she starts this year. 

When she expressed her need for help it was nothing specific and when we had this discussion she did not give me any specific examples and even if she did I leave at 5am and I’m not usually back til 730.

I'm 37M. I live with my wife, Jen, 37F and our two kids,13F and 7F. Last weekend, my wife went out for the day with our oldest daughter, who for this story I will call Emily, while I stayed home with our youngest.

Three hours after they left, I got a call from Emily. She was very upset on the phone and was crying. She explained that they went to a clothing store together, they split up to look at different sections and now Jen is no where to be found and her phone is going to the voicemail. She had asked an employee to make an speaker announcement and no one has come forward, and Jen had been gone for around an hour.

I told Emily not to panic and I come straight down. When I got there, Jen was still gone, and I couldn't see her car in the parking area. We searched for Jen in the stores that are next-door in case she went in one of them, and I also try to call her.

Around 40 minutes later, Jen calls me and says she is on her way back to the clothing store. I asked where she had been, and she says she drove to another nearby store that she wanted to go to. I asked why she didn't bring Emily or at least tell her that she was leaving, and she said because she did not expect to take a long time or for Emily to even notice that she was gone.

Emily has been distraut and avoiding Jen, she is still very upset.

When we got home, Jen and I had an argument as I said that she was irresponsible for going away and leaving Emily in the store without telling her. Jen says I just want to treat Emily like a baby and that she is old enough to be able to be on her own in a store. I asked Jen why she did not answer her phone and she says she accidentally put it on do not disturb. Jen is angry that I called her irresponsible and says that what she did is nowhere close to being an irresponsible parent.

I know I can be overprotective of my kids but we do live in a high crime area and it makes me very angry that Emily was left feeling scared.

1akmu7i,AITA for eating the food my FIL served me and “ruining” my boyfriend and I’s holiday.,"  
Background info: I (M 41) am a white American, and my boyfriend (M 38) is Moroccan and half black. His parents took a dislike to me the moment we met. We’ve been together for two years, and he lives in America. The incident in question took place a few days ago. This is only my second time meeting his parents. His mother has been relatively quiet, but it’s obvious she feels the same as his father, who is on an all out warpath.   
  
They think that I’m a typical, useless, American party boy and not good enough for their son, who is an all around goodie-two-shoes. They are wealthy government employees who think that they’re contributing a lot to the world. Unlike me. Now, it is important to note that I am also wealthy, self made, and high ranking in my career. So I am not attempting to get on any gravy train. My boyfriend and I are staying at their home in Morocco.   
  
The four of us sat down for dinner, cooked by their private chef. Everybody got a bowl of some moroccan food, that smelled really good. I noticed that mine looked paler than the others and didn’t have as much of a smell. I didn’t comment at first, but then his father outright said, as if he was doing me a favor, that he told the chef to put a portion for me aside before she added ANY of the seasoning, because he thought that “my palate wouldn’t handle the spice well”. 

I have no issues with spicy food. I could tell that my boyfriend was already uncomfortable, and he told his father that I could eat what they’re eating. I managed to keep my cool, despite being really pissed off and told him in no uncertain terms that I could handle spicy food. Next thing, he took my food and went back to the kitchen. When he returned, my food was a shade darker than everyone else’s.   
  
I realized after the first bite that it wasn’t just spicy. It was inedible. My boyfriend noticed my reaction and told his father off before telling me to stop eating it. But I didn’t. I ate the damn food. And I have never in my life eaten anything like it. There must have been an entire bottle of hell in it. The pain. But I persevered, much to my boyfriends protests. His father simply watched. I was sweating buckets, felt sick, almost had an asthma attack (Another reason that my boyfriend was angry with me, because I put myself at risk) but I ate the whole bowl. Then I left the table victorious, but dying a death.   
  
Fast forward, I’ve been in bed for three days, still feel messed up, may not survive. My boyfriend says I should have been the bigger person and that there were no winners, that eating the whole bowl was as childish as his father was for serving it, and harmed only me. He’s been taking care of me, but he’s also blaming me.   
  
I don’t think I was the asshole, even if the last three days of our vacation have gone down the drain.   
  
TLDR: My boyfriends father served me inedible food to be petty, so I ate it to be petty and derailed me and my boyfriends vacation plans. And I wouldn’t change a thing.

1az7ufr,AITA for telling my wife it’s weird that she and her mother share location 100% of the time on their phones?,"This just came up casually in conversation with my(37f) mother in law (68f). 
In reference to meeting her at the waterfront near our home, I was asking her to narrow it down a little when she said my wife (40f) could look for her location to make it easier. 

Assuming she was mistaken, I said she would have to share location for that to work and she informed me that she and my wife have that set up 100% of the time. I laughed and said that’s so unhealthy. 

Got off the phone and asked my wife to confirm and she said yes, I asked “Does that mean the opposite is also true? Are you sharing  your location with her 100% of the time?” 
She said yes, 

I was being snarky cos I thought she would agree with me. I said something like “come on, you must think that’s weird. Not even when you say it out loud?” 

Anyway, she’s furious with me, says I’m being mean, she’s crying and left the house furious with me. 

Am I the asshole here? I feel terrible about having blundered in and upset her , and will definitely apologise for the insensitivity as soon as we talk. 

But please someone tell me - is the maps thing normal and I’m the crazy one? 


UPDATE:

Wow, that was an absolute deluge of responses. Truly wasn’t expecting it to have that much engagement. Posting to hopefully wrap things here because I really need to stop reading this for a while. Just going to address a couple of things quickly:

1. Thanks so much to the people that came here sincerely to give me a different perspective on the location sharing thing. My takeaway from lots of people giving their input is that the 24/7 sharing is a much more passive activity whereas I think my experience of using things like dropping a pin or sharing an Uber ride, I think my perception of it is like more of an active thing. 

I get there is a range of perspectives and comfort levels on this and I clearly need to make a bit more space for that. 

2. I’M A WOMAN! 😂😂 Despite me including it in the OP , lots of people did miss the fact that my wife and I are in a queer relationship. Really no offence taken, it’s an easy mistake to make when reading through these quickly. Wanted to highlight it so that hopefully anyone who visits this subsequently doesn’t get into a whole “I don’t get it because I’m a man” conversation. 

3. I behaved in a shitty way to my wife. I thought I was clear on the fact that I knew I was the asshole for my response/attitude/how I said it but I obviously didn’t do a great job of that. My focus was more on the location thing and I definitely saw that my take was definitely in the minority about location sharing. 

4. Lots of people asked follow up questions about my wife and mother in law and people’s health, back stories with lots of further questions about their relationship, my relationship with parents etc. 
I’ve responded to questions about my own relationship with my mum a few places in the thread but I really get the ick at the prospect of adding more personal info about them. 

5. Everyone saying: 
what if something happens? What if she gets in a car accident? What if *all the worst possible things? I’d respectfully ask all of you to stop it. I’ve gotten the point  you’re making but please stop making me visualise the worst possible things happening to the best person I know. 

6. Last but not least, I had already apologised on the phone when I posted this. When my wife came home I apologised again , in person, and she was gracious enough to accept my apology. A little later I told her about this post and told her the internet has decided that I suck and she’s right so that gave us something else to giggle about it. 

Thanks everyone xx",mayorbette,1356,2055,0.7699999809265137,0.2798113189729159,1708814853,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1az7ufr/aita_for_telling_my_wife_its_weird_that_she_and/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-24 22:47:33
1ai9mnk,AITA for refusing to have lunch with my dad after running into him at the vet?,"My mom and dad divorced when I(18m) was 14. Dad visited me once a week until I was 15, when he remarried. 

Yesterday, my mom had me take our cat to the vet for booster vaccination. It’s good time management, with her giving me the credit card and helping me get our cat into the carrier before she went to buy groceries.

I ran into my dad at the vet. First time I saw him in four years. He was there because he left his dog in the car for an hour and the pup got heatstroke. Fortunately he got to the vet in time.

Afterwards he asked if I’d get my cat home and then go have lunch with him, saying he regretted not being there all those years, but I said no.

When I got home and told my mom about it though, she said that people deserve second chances and I should think about giving him one.",Opening_Chipmunk_585,4349,855,0.9700000286102296,0.2606675933526645,1707003483,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ai9mnk/aita_for_refusing_to_have_lunch_with_my_dad_after/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-03 23:38:03

At this point my SIL looked at my brother and said "" see, this is why he won't make a good godfather"" and then gave me a dirty look. my brother looked like he had been slapped but me with my smart mouth I just said "" No, don't worry, bro, I definitely don't wanna raise all 5 of your fucking kids"" which elicited a laugh from my sister, a stern look from my mother and a "" Fuck you, OP"" from my brother who then hung up.

1arszon,AITA for saying my stepmom can't take back how she treated me?,"I (24F) have always had a rocky relationship with my stepmom ""Cindy"" (51F). She came into my life when I was 13, and pretty much as soon as she and my dad were married, she became very pushy about taking up a parental role. She came to all my events and stuff, which I tried to appreciate, but she was also very ""it's my house too and I get to make rules"" after moving in with dad. She was the ""bad cop"" I guess; she was the one who thought I didn't have enough chores, that my grades weren't good enough, that I needed screen time limits, etc, and that lead to a lot of arguments.   
   
I hit the last straw at 17. The lawn needed cutting before Sunday; my dad said he'd do it Saturday afternoon, so I made plans to go hang out with friends for the day. While I was out, Cindy messaged me saying I shouldn't have let dad do the lawn because he'd had a tiring week, and that I would be doing it; her usual MO basically. I said no and stayed out with my friends. when I got home, she was furious and tried to ground me and it turned into this big stupid argument where I pulled the you're not my mom card. Dad ended up stepping in; I wasn't grounded, but also asked me to try and get along with her.   
   
It didn't matter, because she decided she was done. She just kinda stopped acknowledging me; we basically became roommates who hated each other. I wasn't even allowed to eat food she bought (not special stuff; like, when the bread ran out and she was the one to replace it). It was all just really tense, and I ended up spending a lot more time at my mom's apartment until I went to college.    
   
I've never formally blocked her or gone NC but we just haven't spoken since; she never came anytime I met up with Dad etc. Until me and my fiance announced our engagement. The wedding is over a year away, but Cindy sent me a long text, congratulating me and asking for all the details so she could help plan. She was asking about coming to dress fittings and if we wanted an engagement party and if she could make a speech at the wedding, basically asking about all the mother-of-the-bride stuff and pretending the last 11 years didn't happen. I didn't reply, until Dad reached out asking why I hadn't.   
   
I was honest with him; I'm weirded out by this. I'm happy for Cindy to come as his plus one, but she's not getting any role at the wedding (we're actually not even doing a head table, just because I don't want to share a table with her or separate her from Dad) because she's not my mom and the last time I saw her she was insistent about that. It's turned into a whole thing; he says she's really hurt and that he's rethinking coming to the wedding(?!) because she doesn't want to go, I say she can't take back what happened, and at the very least she should have apologised before reaching out like this.   
    
Mom and my partner are supportive of me, but I've had messages from several people on dad's side saying I'm an AH for 'punishing' Cindy and it's getting to me, so, AITA?",Character_Address53,4858,534,0.9700000286102296,0.2444319466958895,1708037979,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1arszon/aita_for_saying_my_stepmom_cant_take_back_how_she/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-15 22:59:39
1aolnna,AITA for deciding my baby’s name even though my husband hadn’t agreed on it?,"I, 32F, and my husband Chris, 33M, had our daughter about 2 months ago. We have similar tastes in names and we agreed upon Lara for a girl pretty early on. We found out a year ago that my sister Andrea, 35f, had been diagnosed with cancer. By the time I got pregnant she was already very sick. At 24 weeks pregnant, she passed away. We had not decided on a middle name at the time, but my husband wanted to give Lara his mother’s name, Jane, and he was set on it. After Andrea passed I wanted Lara’s middle name to be Andrea. He said he hated the name Andrea and it would make more sense to name her after her grandma than an aunt. This made me upset and I told him that his mother was alive and well, and I wanted to remember my sister. I brought up giving her two middle names and he didn’t want to do that either.

When she was born we still hadn’t agreed on one. Towards the end of the birthing process, the visuals were a bit too much for Chris and he passed out. So when the nurse asked what the name was, I said Lara Andrea. Once he was conscious again I told him that I put down Lara Andrea. He mumbled “fine”. I thought he was okay with Lara Andrea now, but now I realize he was trying to be nice because I just gave birth.

Last month he brought up changing the name to Lara Jane. I said no because we had already named her, and I brought up doing two middle names again. He got mad at me and we’ve been arguing about this practically every day. He keeps calling her Lara Jane. He STILL doesn’t want to do double middle name. I feel our family and friends are biased because they either knew Andrea or know Jane. I feel like maybe I should’ve done a double middle name or put down Jane, and I’m wondering if I should change it.

I feel like I might be in the wrong here for ignoring his opinion and taking advantage of the fact he was unconscious to choose the name I wanted. So AITA?

  
edit: Thank you for all the replies and suggestions. Most of them were either YTA or ESH, which I both understand. I apologized to Chris. The most liked name combo on r/namenerds was Andrea Jane.

1av2qx9,AITA For not caring that my daughter is going through a difficult time with a friend and returning her birthday gift after the way she treated her cousin?,"What Happened: My daughter Brooke’s birthday was on Friday, so we had a celebration at home. Everything was going well until it was time for singing. Brooke blew out the candles and her cousin Aria blew on the cake too.

My SIL and BIL said oops and apologized. Aria obviously didn’t understand. It was just an accident. But then Brooke turned it into a scene. She snapped at Aria, raising her voice and calling Aria a “F\*\*\*ing brat.”

I immediately got firm and told Brooke to apologize. Brooke tried to argue that Aria ruined her birthday candles. I told Brooke that I don’t care who you are or what day it is. It is **never** okay to treat a 3-year-old that way as a 20-year-old adult. Brooke refused to apologize and stormed off.

After everyone had left, I informed Brooke that because she refused to apologize for the way she acted towards her cousin, I was returning her purse which was the main gift I had bought her. She also got a Stanley Cup but I let her to keep it since it’s something practical for school.

Brooke tried arguing that she’s too old for me to be confiscating her things and returning the purse was going too far. But I just told Brooke that I bought the purse with my own money and was free to do what I pleased with it. And if she wanted to act like a child then she’s going to get treated like one.

Why I’m Writing: My wife Kimberly said she is not going to re-buy the purse for Brooke and she agreed Brooke was out-of-line for how she treated Aria during the birthday celebration. But Kim said that I should have more understanding for Brooke because of what’s going on with Jessy.

Jessy has been Brooke’s best friend since they were in 4th grade. The problem is that Jessy recently got engaged and her fiance is not a good guy. Brooke and Jessy’s family staged an intervention to talk to Jessy, but Jessy is insistent on the marriage and has been talking to Brooke less and less.

Of course, I understand that it is a heartbreaking situation and am sorry Brooke has to experience that with her friend. But what is happening with Jessy has nothing to do with the way Brooke treated Aria.

If Brooke had snapped at Aria but immediately apologized after, then I could see how returning her purse could be seen as unfair. But I think Kimberly is being too lenient with our daughter, and Brooke needs to understand that going through a difficult situation is not an excuse to behave poorly towards others. AITA?

Edited to answer a common question: My SIL was holding Aria and keeping an eye on her during the birthday celebration. My BIL was explaining to Aria why she can't blow on the candles on someone else's birthday. We were in the middle of correcting Aria when Brooke snapped at her.",BirthdayAHThrowaway,2471,1185,0.8999999761581421,0.2257261189653881,1708386386,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1av2qx9/aita_for_not_caring_that_my_daughter_is_going/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-19 23:46:26
1b1q76f,AITA because I didn't let my son stay home today?,"My son (16M) approached me yesterday after school and told me that he didn't want to go to school the next day. I asked him why and he told me that he just didn't feel like going and he was tired of waking up early in the morning. I told him that that wasn't a good enough reason for him to stay home and that if he feels tired when waking up in the morning then he should try and go to get in bed earlier.

He got upset with me when I told him that and told me that he needs to stay home for the sake of his mental health. He then told me that making him go to school would only worsen it. I asked him why he thought that and he told me that the kids and teachers at his school irritates him. This made me concerned so I asked him if anyone was bullying him or if he was having problems with some of his teachers and he just told me that he wasn't and he just finds them annoying. I asked him if that was the only reason and he told me that it was.

I understood where my son was coming from and I tried to show my understanding. I told him how I sometimes find my co workers annoying too, but that doesn't mean I get to skip work just because of it. I told him that if he is serious about school being detrimental to his mental health then I told him that I'll try and find him a therapist to help him manage it. He then got even more mad at me and told me that he doesn't need a therapist and that he only needs time away from school. He told me that I don't understand how stressful school can be and that's why he needs time away. I told him that I do understand, and a therapist could be beneficial in helping him deal with stress.

He started arguing with me about not wanting to go again and I just got frustrated. I told him that he has an upcoming doctor's appointment this Wednesday so there's no need for him to miss both Tuesday and Wednesday. I told him that I don't want him to miss days of school unless they are absolutely necessary. 

He took this as me telling him that his mental health wasn't important and then he started telling me that I must not love him if I send him to school. He then told me that if I try and force him to see a therapist I'll have something else to worry about?? I asked him to clarify what he meant by that but he didn't specify. He just told me not to worry about it and to leave him alone. 

Cut to this morning, he was very hostile with me from the moment he woke up and was practically ignoring me whenever I tried to speak to him. Then when I dropped him off at school he told me  that he finds it weird that I hate him so much and don't want him to succeed in life?? Then before I could say anything he got out of the car quickly. When I picked him up from school today, I tried to talk about what happened and what he said but he just ignored me and is still not speaking to me?

1aq7hxr,AITA for telling my sober friend it's not my job to have the exact non-alcoholic drink she wants at the parties I throw?,"I'm in college right now. My best friend Joshua (made up for anonymity purposes) is dating one of my other friends Ashley (also made up), and she barely ever drinks. Which, good for her, I respect people that are sober. 

I have parties at my place around once a month and like to make a batched alcoholic punch of some kind, but I get Coke or fruit punch or something non alcoholic as well, cause I don't want to pressure people to drink. 

At the last party I threw, despite having Coke Zero and Dr Pepper, Ashley was like ""Do you have sparkling water?"" I said ""No."" I don't really like sparkling water, so I'd never buy it for myself. She looked upset but she said regular water was fine. 

She sends me this long text message the next day, basically saying ""I really wish you would have sparkling water for me when you throw stuff and consider me. I don't like really sugary stuff like soda and don't want to drink, but it's boring having just water to drink. Just because I don't drink doesn't mean I don't deserve a fun drink too."" 

I basically told her ""It's not my job to buy something I don't ever drink with MY money just for YOU to have. I provide non-alcoholic options because I am considerate of you and the other people that don't drink and if you don't want to drink them then go to your store and buy some yourself. I advertise it as BYOB, so that can apply to you. Or at least have Joshua buy it for you, I'm not your servant.""

Joshua's not mad at me but he told me I should talk to Ashley and apologize. I just don't get why I should apologize. That would imply I did something wrong. Sparkling water doesn't cost a lot so it's not a money thing, but it's the principle of it. Wanting me to buy something *else* for each party when I provide 1-2 NA options, *and* you're capable of buying it and bringing it yourself, and you don't even offer to buy me something or do something for me in return. Plus why am I being held to a higher standard than her literal boyfriend?

I just wish it didn't feel like people took advantage of me all the time and expected me to do every single thing for them.",BitchImLilBaby,3698,742,0.959999978542328,0.2233118460513861,1707865659,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1aq7hxr/aita_for_telling_my_sober_friend_its_not_my_job/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-13 23:07:39
1ateunj,AITA - I refuse to move my wedding date,"Sorry guys, this is a bit of a long one. 
I (34f) got engaged to my fiance (37m) September 2022. My sister (27f) was getting married in summer 2023. When I got engaged, I had my wedding date already picked for early summer 2024 and immediately told my family the date. My sister is a photographer and so I warned her with plenty of notice to not book for that date. I tried talking to her about my wedding planning but she asked me not to talk to her about it because she just wanted to focus on hers only. Fine, no big deal but doesn’t mean I’m not going to continue to plan mine. This past October (2023) she asked me to remind her of the date. When I told her, she said that she booked a wedding back in January for that date and asked me to move it. I have said no because this date was properly planned out and picked for me and my fiance. I’m now being told it’s my fault and clearly she’s not that important to me because I’m refusing to move my wedding date. I see it the other way around. Why wouldn’t she cancel her client in order to prioritize me. I’m the oldest child of 4. I never ask for anything, this is the 1 thing I am holding fast on. I am heart broken that she won’t be there, but also extremely hurt that she is putting all the blame on me rather than accepting she also has control over her decisions. Am I wrong? AITA?

Update: 
Thank you everyone for your support. I am not okay in all this and never stand strong on anything and 9/10 usually cave in to give family what they want vs my own needs. But, that’s boundaries and that’s what I’m learning for myself. To answer some questions. When I first got engaged she told me she wanted to photograph my wedding. Then we talked about it and decided it wasn’t the best idea because she wouldn’t be able to be present at the wedding and would just be behind a camera the whole time. 
I’m now being told that my mom and other sister agree with her and that I didn’t tell her until this past October, yet I have a family group text proving otherwise.  
I’m staying strong. I’m not moving my date. But like I said, I’m just heartbroken that this is how it is turning out.

1ar1ay7,AITA for not carrying on another family's tradition?,"In our house, we have two birthdays coming up. My wife's son Marcel (turning 16) and her daughter Marceline (turning 13). Asking them what they want for their birthday, they both said that just the ""normal gift"" was great. Seeing that I was confused, my wife helpfully reminded me of the ""traditional luggage gift"", and then I realized. 

There was a family tradition of giving kids a luggage set for their 16th birthday, yes, but that was my ex-wife's family, not mine. I was never even involved. It was always a thing for them. A few decades ago, one of my ex's sisters got a job at a high-end luggage company, and took over for the next gen of the family (my daughter and her cousins) because she could get it for really cheap with her discount. My daughter is the youngest of the kids on that side, and around the time she was turning 13, between the aunt knowing she would be retiring soon and some personal drama, they decided to give my daughter her set for her 13th birthday so she wouldn't be left out. 

I've always thought that tradition was stupid and a stupid amount of money to spend. Even $1,000 is way too much to spend on luggage for anyone, especially a kid. I wouldn't spend that much on myself. I tried to tell them all of this. My wife thinks that by letting my daughter participate (by accepting the gift), I've made it my family tradition as well, and now I'm just singling her kids out. I'm not. 

Not caring about her accepting a gift from her own aunts doesn't mean I don't still think it's stupid. There's a LOT of difference between ""you can't have this because it's not worth buying"" and ""you can't have this because I think it's inappropriate or dangerous"". 

Also, it would be even more expensive for us to buy it for them than even the aunt spent on my daughter. My daughter's set cost me $0, and her aunt $1,000 as she had a discount. Buying the other kids' sets would cost me $2,000 each, so $4,000. 

Now everyone is upset at me because I'm apparently making it clear that I don't care about Marcel and Marceline as much as my daughter because I'm breaking tradition and telling them they don't ""deserve anything"" that my daughter had. Am I wrong for thinking this is ridiculous?",travelinman55,3422,655,0.949999988079071,0.2031346699030611,1707953787,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ar1ay7/aita_for_not_carrying_on_another_familys_tradition/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-14 23:36:27
1az7lll,AITA for telling my mom that I won’t postpone my wedding if she pays for my nose job (that I blame her for),"My fiancé (34M) and I (31F) got engaged in Nov 2023. We were planning a Dec 2024 wedding, but we’ve learned that I need a nose job for medical & aesthetic reasons, so we’ve postponed the wedding until after due to finances. My mom (65F) is mad about the whole thing & how it will be perceived by relatives.

*BACKSTORY*

When I was 9, I fell off my bike & broke my nose.


Sadly, my mom didn’t believe that it was broken. She said I was “over-exaggerating” the pain. She refused to take me to the doctor. It hurt so much, I cried daily for weeks.


*Note: she was a SAHM & we live in Canada, so taking me to a doctor wouldn’t have cost money or time off work.*


Since then, I’ve had issues with breathing and awful sinus pain- occasionally to the point of vomiting. Flying is torture. Random weather changes are torture. I spend 16-23 days a year in bed immobilized by pain/pressure in my left sinuses. 


Also, my nose never looked the same after. In middle school, kids said l look like Gollum and I’m still a little self conscious about it. 


In 2021, I decided that I can’t live like this anymore and started working with my doctor to figure out the root cause of my sinus issues.

The Canadian healthcare system moves slowly. 

A couple weeks ago, I got MRI results back and they established that:
(1) My nose was broken in childhood
(2) It didn’t heal properly because it had no medical intervention 
(3) I need surgery for my nose/sinuses to work, so I can live/breathe like a normal person.


Since they’re doing surgery on my nose anyway, I decided I want my nose’s aesthetic fixed at the same time. They will make my nose look like it would’ve naturally.


Canadian healthcare will pay for the “medical” part of surgery. It won’t pay for the cosmetic part. Nose jobs are expensive. 


We decided to postpone the wedding so we can pay for my nj ASAP instead. I can’t wait to breathe properly, and to have a “normal” nose. 


Last week, I told my mom about the postponement and she flipped. She says relatives are planning their whole year around my wedding, and this is a really unfair to do this to them over “vanity”. 


I told her that I can’t afford a nj and a wedding in the same year. & that it was unfair to me that she refused to take me to a doctor back in the day. & that if she really wants the wedding this year, she could pay for my nj so I don’t have to. 

We haven’t spoken since.

Tbh, since it was confirmed by a doctor that I *did* break my nose as a kid, I’ve had simmering anger/hurt towards my mom. I’ve lived with awful pain for decades, and now need surgery for something that could’ve been avoided if she had just believed me & been a parent… but maybe telling her to pay for the nj was unfair/too petty. AITA?

1awqdj7,AITA for Refusing to get my Pregnant Wife Coconut Yogurt for her Cravings and then Telling her she Needs to Manage her Expectations? ,"My (26M) wife (26F) and I are going to be having a baby soon, she is 4 months pregnant.

My wife has been having intense cravings and I am more than happy to bring her favourite food from work. Most of the times, I also cook for her when she wants something really specific.

My wife has her own cupboard and a section in the fridge that has JUST her snacks - I don’t take her stuff without asking her. Last night, I had coconut yogurt and some rolled oats with fruit for a quick dinner - and this yogurt was kept in the shared space. I ate the last pack not knowing my wife has been having cravings for it, so it was unusual what happened today. 

I work a physically demanding job and today was a pretty exhausting day. I was looking forward to just relaxing at home and watching a movie. An hour into relaxing at home my wife came into the kitchen area looking for coconut yogurt, I told her I ate the last pack and she got a little upset because she saw this choco-based recipe on tiktok and coconut yogurt was a key ingredient in this meal. She said that since I ate the last pack, I should go outside right now and get it for her. Now, the nearest grocery store is like 30 minutes away and I really didn’t want to go outside. 

I told her as much and said had she asked me to bring it while coming home from work I would’ve gone to buy it for her. She started pestering me and putting pressure on me and I got irritated with her. She said that she’s pregnant and has intense cravings and as a good partner should make sure she’s feeling happy and comfortable. And that food is the only thing that brings her joy. Said that I can’t understand what she’s going through. 

I told her that she’s being really unfair and making me out to be a bad husband and that she needs to manage her expectations. I said that this is just a craving, it’ll pass in some time. I’ll get it tomorrow for her but just not now. 

She has been showing an attitude to me and it’s really making me want to say that she should be grateful that I do all these things for her but I won’t because I don’t want make her more pouty.

1axjlkz,AITA for telling the father of my child that I won’t share custody until I know he knows how to be a father?,"I’m gonna start this off by saying he doesn’t want to go to court to figure this out, but we will if absolutely necessary. 

So I just gave birth to a baby girl a few weeks ago. My ex and I broke up while pregnant (we argued way too much and both agreed that kind of environment is not good for a baby, so please don’t come at me for being a single mom). We have been working together as a team to be the best parents we can be, regardless of the split. He wants shared custody, but I’m very hesitant because he’s admitted that he doesn’t know the first thing about babies. 

I’ve tried showing him how to change her diaper but it grosses him out. He says he can just have his mom do it because he still lives with her. I told him that as much as I love and respect his mom, it is not her responsibility and she is not going to be the one with custody. I’d trust her with both mine and my child’s life, but he is the father and he needs to know how to change her diaper. 

Another issue is he works a lot and a lot of the time, he goes away on business trips. I asked him how that would work if he goes away on one of his custody weeks, and again, he said he’d have his mom take care of her. It’s important to note that his mom is a hard working woman and works about 60-80 hours a week. 

I think the biggest thing that worries me is that he lives two hours away and I can’t imagine the anxiety it would bring to have my infant that far away from me. 

He’s been calling me selfish, saying that I’m keeping his child from him, which I understand, but that’s not true. I have a spare room in my house that I told him he can stay in whenever he wants, so he can stay for the night or literally however long he’d like, or I can come to his place (his mom has a spare room and said that I can come stay if I’d like). This arrangement would work very well because our daughter is exclusively breastfed (we’ve tried breastmilk in a bottle but she won’t latch). 

Also, he has not bought a single thing for her (despite having more than enough money). All the baby stuff at his house was bought by his mom. I am so grateful for her love and support, but again, he is the father and he has not shown any sort of responsibility. 

He’s pissed at me for “implying he’s not a good dad” but all I’ve been saying is I would like to be sure that the person taking care of her knows what they’re doing. I’ve been trying to show him how but he gets really defensive and doesn’t want to learn. I told him we can just go to court to figure it out (neither of us want a nasty court battle but it we can do it amicably) but he doesn’t want to so they can’t “order him to pay child support,” which pisses me off because regardless of whether or not you’re ordered to pay child support, you should want to do everything possible to support your child. Anyway, AITA for not “letting him” take care of his baby?",Godimsodamntired,1496,1096,0.9200000166893004,0.1786861678931091,1708640452,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1axjlkz/aita_for_telling_the_father_of_my_child_that_i/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-22 22:20:52
1aj0blb,AITA for refusing to babysit for my aunt and uncle until I'm paid for the last time?,"Borrowing a friends account (Thanks btw)

I (17/F) have been voluteering at my previous elementary school. I'm not sure if its relevant, but my cousins ( Ella 6/F & Liam 8/M) go to this school as well. 

I'm known as the ""fun one"" at school (kids words, not mine). Because of this, a lot of the parents of the younger kids ask me to babysit. I love kids, so its not hard for me. The parents are usually out for a few hours, and I only ask for about $20 per day. I've had no problem with this since.

about a month ago, my Aunt and uncle went off on a vacation for a week, and asked me to babysit. I agreed of course. I stayed over each night, to their request. My cousins are not hard kids to deal with, they're actually very sweet and well behaved for their age. Because of this, and that they're family, I only charged $10/day. So, about $70 since they got home later in the night. 

I waited a day or two after they got before asking about the payment, and they outright refused. Saying that because they're family, I should do it for free. They also said that since I said they werent hard kids, I didn't have to do much.

After a little back and forth, I decided to cut my loses and didn't babysit for them again. Now, they're planning to go on a bit of a road trip together, and they asked me to babysit again. I said if they paid me for the last time I babysat then I'd be more than happy. They kept complaining and whining, saying I'm the only person they have (I'm not tho, they have multiple other people available).

 They're now complaining to my parents, trying to get them to make me babysit, but I'm still refusing until they pay me for the last time. My parents are asking me to just do it to keep the peace.

1asmgxn,AITA for refusing to pay for private school for my step daughter,"A bit of backstory regarding this. I (36m) have been with my wife (37f) for 8 years. Of the two children there is my stepdaughter (13) and our daughter (6). We have been discussing sending our daughter to private school (PS) for the last few weeks and it has now boiled over into a full blown argument. She believes that if we send our daughter to PS that I should send my stepdaughter to PS as well as it would be “neglecting” her otherwise. My wife has majority custody of my stepdaughter and does not recieve child support for her as her ex husband made very poor life choices which I understand. My wife also has not worked for the entirety of our relationship. I have covered all of my stepdaughters expenses from day 1. After seeing how poorly the public school system has done for my stepdaughter I brought up and have been insistent on sending our daughter to private school. In my mind I want to give our daughter the best possible chance in terms of education which from what I’ve seen does not bode well in public school. Although I love and treat my stepdaughter as my own I do not feel as though I should be responsible for her education as I have never been given a say in regards to it from the beginning. I do have the financial means to send both however, it will be pushing the limits of what I can feasibly do in terms of vacations, birthdays, holidays etc. for our family. My wife disagrees and says that if I can do it for our daughter then I must do it for my stepdaughter regardless of if we have to give up vacations and cut back.

1b0va9w,AITA For excluding my wife’s friend from trip solely because we think she is annoying?,"Maybe not as dramatic as other situations here but here goes, My(M31) wife (F30) has a friend, we’ll call her Dana (F34), they have been friends for a little more than 10 years and it’s important to note that the only friend Dana has is my wife (for the sake of the post I’ll call her Laura).

  
Dana has always had difficulties making and keeping friends, this is because she’s a classical “one upper” if you tell her about a vacation you had and enjoy, she’ll tell you it’s nothing compared to her last vacation. You’re going through a bad time? We’ll it’s nothing compared to what’s she’s going through and stuff like that.

  
Since her only friend is Laura, I got to hang out with her a lot, I don’t like her and don’t consider her a friend but I am civil to her.

  
Laura has tried to integrate Dana to another group of friends of ours for a few years now but it not going well. The breaking point was one night when we were drinking and a friend opened up about losing a beloved pet and Dana responded by saying it was nothing compared to when she lost a blouse her mother had given her last year. After that some people wouldn’t hang out if she was coming and so.

  
Now to the issue, we’re planning a week long camping trip along with 2 more friends and their spouses, of these friends, only one of them has met Dana. 

  
Laura thinks this might be a good chance for Dana to meet new people, so she suggested we invite her I was obviously against it, I get tired just imagining a week with her and told her so, she knows I’m not a fan of hers but is hoping  I will help her improve her social skill but I don’t think our vacation should be her opportunity, we fought a little and didn’t solve anything.

  
Here is why I think I could be an asshole. I continue planning the trip and every time Laura told me to invite Dana I would just tell her I’ll do it once all is set up (I had no intention in doing so), anyway the trip is a few weeks away and last Saturday the cat was out of the bag about me not wanting Dana to come. 

  
Laura argues that “being annoying” is no reason to exclude her and if she needs to improve her social skills we should be helping her, I obviously disagree but I have never seen Laura this angry so I’m doubting myself. So Am I the Asshole?

HOWEVER… my boyfriend feels because we are a couple and plan on getting engaged soon.. that I should split my winnings with him so he doesn’t take such a big hit, and really since it’s extra money it shouldn’t mean that much to me.

I have been no contact with my parents for years, but recently they got diagnosed with dementia, and my siblings agreed that someone should stop by at least two times a day. 

A few days ago I got guilt tripped by my brother, to ""pull my weight"" and check in on them that afternoon. While visiting they got all serious and said there was something important they wanted to discuss with me before I left. They sat me down and asked me to just hear them out and consider what they had to say. Not knowing what was coming I agreed.

They stated that they believed, that my wife, Lesli, was going to cheat on me, now that I am legally obligated to be take care of Gwen. They went on to explain that she has been isolating me from my real family to prevent me from hearing the truth. They urged me to just call a lawyer they know and they pulled out a business card and kept trying to force me to take.

I kept asking them to just stop, but they kept speaking over me, telling me they just want to help, so I kept getting louder and louder till I was shouting. By the point that I was yelling I wasn't thinking entirely reasonably, if I was I would have just left. Instead I yelled that I don't visit because they are terrible people who made my childhood miserable. Then I told them they are not family, and I don't care if they rot.

As you can imagine this did not go over well with my siblings. They believe they are all making sacrifices to care for them, so I should just deal with it like they do. They went on to explain that  it wasn't so bad since at least their intentions were to try to help.

1awpnrj,"AITA for uninviting my parents to my wedding after they said they would be leaving early to throw a separate ""celebration"" at their house?","First post here, sorry for any grammatical errors.

Me and my girlfriend just got engaged after almost 9 years of dating and are planning on having our wedding spring of next year. With this we have begun planning the wedding and one of the topics that came up was if we want kids at our wedding. We are both the oldest kids/cousins in our family and with this have had multiple little kids at every major event in our lives. We decided that we do not want young kids (under 10)  to attend the reception as we want to have a more adult style of reception. 

When mentioning this to my mother she was not happy with the decision we made as some people will have to leave early because of the no kids rule. There are 3 families that are invited that have kids under 10 with a total of 7 kids under 10 years old. Me and my fiancé were expecting at least one of the parents if not both from each family to leave early to take care of their kids and were completely ok with this as they have other responsibilities to tend to. 

Now my mother is saying that her and my step dad will be leaving early so that they can throw a separate celebration at their house so that the people that are forced to leave since they have kids have somewhere to go and can still have a good time. With this she is telling most of the guest from her side of the family  (about 50 of the 125 invited) that they should come to her party instead of the reception. 

After hearing this from her we got into a heated argument, with her saying she is doing what she feels is right and doesn't need my permission to throw a celebration. it ended with me saying ""You are choosing to throw a ""celebration"" at the same time as our reception against our wishes, which you don't need our permission for, you are right about that. but if you are going to leave early because you feel it is the ""right thing todo"" you can just not worry about coming to the wedding in the first place. Because i certainly feel the right thing todo would be to support your kids wishes on his wedding day instead of leaving early to go party somewhere else."" 

This is very difficult for me to accept as I have always imagined my parents being there on my wedding day but at the same time we do not want her there if she is just going to leave early to go party somewhere else and try to take half of our guests with her.

1b2lnwd,AITA for screaming at my sons gf mom to get out of my house?,"My husband and I come from a small religious town. Which we are strongly religious we don’t follow the same strict rules as everyone else were very open minded. Our oldest son(18Jacob) girlfriend moved in with us on her 18th birthday, due to finding out she was pregnant and her parents were extremely controlling. We were shamed by everyone in our town for the pregnancy itself, but we never paid a mind to it. Three weeks ago, Jacob girlfriend had her baby, she kept it a secret from her mother, but we’re assuming someone at the hospital opened their mouths.

 Two nights ago we had a banging at my door, and it was her mother demanding to come in and see “this secret baby.” My sons girlfriend said I could let her in if she promised to calm down, in which I relayed the message and obliged. Her mother was calm at first, until she began talking about how she’d pray for her daughters soul not to be damned, and began loudly praying in my livingroom. I told her she needed to stop, and she began to calm down then tried telling my sons girlfriend that they could fix this, that the baby is still young enough to be deeply wanted by an adopting family.  My sons girlfriend started crying and I told her it was time to leave. 

She started saying I was sugar coating things for these kids and that they have no clue how to raise a baby and they are too young. She called my son rude names and basically said he’d be working at the county for the rest of his life and I told her she needed to get out of my house right now, very loudly in which she obliged.

1avwl7y,AITAH for not getting a nose piercing when my husband really wants me to?,"My husband and I have very similar taste in all aspects but one - body modification. He’s a tattoo toting, piercing loving guy. I like to appreciate the art on others. I don’t personally have a problem with body modification - I just don’t want to modify mine. 

I have a friend who is beautiful beyond reason, and she really pulls off piercings so well. She’s made me consider getting (gasp) second lobe piercings. 

I asked my husband what he thought about me getting second love piercings, and somehow the conversation turned to getting a tattoo. I told him flat out “No.” We’d been through this ten years ago when we were dating. He can get as many tattoos as he wants, but I don’t want any.

So then he asks, “What about a nose piercing?” He said it in a cheeky kind of way, so I rolled my eyes and said, “I’ll think about it.” And I did. For days. I didn’t mention it to my husband because I knew he wasn’t really being cheeky - he was being half serious. But I did consider the nose piercing. Honestly, I don’t want a piercing on my face. 

Well, today my husband sent me a picture of ear piercings and asked me which one I wanted. Then he says, “And a nose piercing?” I decided that I needed to come clean to him. I told him that I don’t want a piercing on my face. He then said that I’ve broken his heart and that I never do anything he likes. 

That was five hours ago. Now, he won’t return my calls or texts (we’re long distance for a few months while I’m working abroad).

1agnz27,AITA for not telling my husband to go to his sister's wedding even though I'm not invited?,"My husband (m26) and I (f25) have three kids, our eldest is 7, then we have a 4 year old and a ten month old baby. My husband's sister (f30) is the one getting married. 

Our relationship with her isn't so great, she is always making unnecessary comments. I know that she dislikes me a lot, she didn't like me from the first time my (then boyfriend) introduced us together. Then when I got pregnant I was still in school and my boyfriend had just started college. He dropped out and we needed a lot of support from our families to settle down back then. So my SIL thinks that I f*cked up her brother's/ family's life because I didn't get an abortion at the time. She has always been rather hostile, we mostly only see her at family gatherings, she doesn't visit or anything and honestly that's better. She has caused problems before because she says that my husband was the ""golden child"" and she was the ""scapegoat"", and then when I got pregnant their parents basically adopted me and spoiled me because I was with my husband. 

So, she sent invitations for her wedding. She sent my husband his invitation which had his name and our three kids' names, not mine. My hubby asked her about this and she said that I'm not a pleasant person to be around, so I'm not invited. He told her that is extremely disrespectful since I'm his wife, they argued a bit through text and my husband told her to not count on him or the kids because they're not going. 

She blamed it on my hubby being immature. My in-laws tried to mediate between them, she replied to them saying that she's not surprised they're taking our side. They argued and my in-laws said that since she's having this attitude, they're not going either to the wedding. Immediately after she started blaming me. She said that this is all my fault because I could've just accepted that I am not invited and ""allow"" my husband and children to exist without me for a couple hours. She also called me stupid and uneducated, also spoiled, and said I have ""princess syndrome"".

I told this to my husband and his parents, they told some other family members and now apparently a lot of them cancelled their assistance as well. She keeps blaming it all in me. Yes, I didn't tell my husband to go, I admit that, so I think that's why I'm possibly an asshole because I could've prevented such a big drama and I didn't. Also I think that she's just an asshole in general, but in this case she might be for expecting my husband to be okay with her leaving me behind.",Tiny_Violinist9932,1938,338,0.9399999976158142,0.1113845395550526,1706827443,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1agnz27/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_to_go_to_his/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-01 22:44:03

1aleaaj,AITA for embarrassing my sister in public by accusing her boyfriend of stealing my tip money?,"We live in different states and she just started dating this guy although he’s been a part of her friend group since college. This was also the first time I met her boyfriend.

This past weekend I was in a city near hers and called to see if she wanted to meet up. She had plans with her friends so she invited me to come along, which I did. We had a fun day with the group and eventually went to dinner. Nothing was out of the ordinary until the check came. Her boyfriend took the check, read aloud the amount, and split the bill and tip (which we rounded to $10 a person) amongst the table then he placed his credit card for the server to take away. Everyone handed him cash for their portion. I guess I gave off a look so my sister explained that he doesn’t like to go to the bank so whenever the group goes out, he pays with his card and the group gives him cash. I didn’t think anything further about it so I handed him my portion.

The next day I couldn’t find my prescription sunglasses in my hotel room or rental car and I knew I had it yesterday. I remembered the last time I took it off was when we got to the restaurant. On my way to lunch with my sister and some people from last night, I stopped by last night’s restaurant to ask if they found a pair of sunglasses and was greeted by the same server but this time she looked angry. 

The short of it was that I found out my sister’s boyfriend only tipped her $10 for our group of 12 people. I was taken aback because based on our split, she should have gotten $120 in tips. I asked to see the receipt and sure enough, it was $10. I apologized and gave her another $10. When I got to lunch, I immediately asked him to give me back $10. That started the questions from the group that descended into an argument until the restaurant asked us to leave. 

My sister is now mad at me for causing a scene and embarrassing her in front of her friends and the people in the restaurant.",InformalSignature436,2063,248,0.959999978542328,0.1061575031779731,1707341513,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1aleaaj/aita_for_embarrassing_my_sister_in_public_by/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-07 21:31:53

1askspc,AITA for sending my daughter to live with her father?,"I divorced my ex when Lana (15f) was small. After a while I met my husband, who had a son (17m) from a previous marriage and we had a baby (2f) together.

His son accepted me just fine, we managed to create an amazing blended family, if not for the fact that Lana wasn’t a fan of the idea. She openly disrespects my husband, her step brother and her little sister and said multiple times that she doesn’t consider them family.

I said okay then, you may not love them or even like, but everyone would benefit from having some mutual respect. Neither me nor my husband forced Lana into the family. But she would always start unnecessary drama, screaming and yelling that she wants to live with her father. Her daddy dearest was definitely putting those ideas in her head.

Things escalated when me and my husband had to attend an important work event, we work at the same company, so we couldn’t just skip it, no one of us could. My step son had football practice that day, he’s in his senior year and he’s a very successful player so we hope he gets a scholarship and that’s why we’re strict about him attending practice. I asked Lana to babysit her little sister, she outright refused, making a huge scene. Please note that I don’t use her as an unpaid babysitter, in fact I don’t demand anything from her and was more than ready to add a little extra to her allowance.

Her throwing a scene was the final straw. I’ve been dealing with her tantrums and disrespect for three years now, ever since I married my husband. I had enough, and as she was at school, I got in contact with my ex, packed her bags and took them to his house. My ex was more than happy to take her in and he picked her up from school that day.

Here’s the kicker: my ex lives off the grid in a very rural area. They have to run a generator and my ex is stingy about the fuel. He has no wifi and connection at his house is barely strong enough to browse websites, so no TikTok or Instagram. Lana has to use the outhouse, and since the warm water is sparse, she’s not allowed long showers anymore. My ex is a very strict parent and Lana managed to get her iPhone taken away and replaced with a flip phone on her first day at his place (for the record, she said an f word in front of him and he’s the kind of parent who demands being called sir). And she actually has to do way more chores that are more complicated and time consuming because my ex has 24 hour shifts often.

Of course she wants to come back now. My husband says I should take her back in because she learned the lesson. My ex says he’d rather keep her as he got an unpaid housemaid now and her allowance is now his child support. I personally don’t want to take her back in. I’m content with the zero amount of drama we have at home now. Lana says I’m an asshole.",BreadfruitTop2876,638,585,0.8299999833106995,0.0892581512692193,1708120509,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1askspc/aita_for_sending_my_daughter_to_live_with_her/,2024,2,AmItheAsshole,2024-02-16 21:55:09
1atfyqh,"AITA for refusing to give a girl a ride because she had a ""therapy dog""?","I (M18) have a pretty decent relationship with this girl, Mira (F18), who lives in my residence. She's next door to my roommate and me, and we have many classes together. Mira and I also hang out in overlapping social groups and are part of some study groups together, so we know each other decently well.

While we get along most of the time, Mira can be a bit whiny and annoying. She complains about everything and seems to love to argue about every little thing with me. Its bizarre because some of my friends noticed that she seems to have some strange fixation with arguing with me.

After the December break, Mira came back to school with a small retriever puppy named Max, which she claimed as her therapy dog. Mira takes Max everywhere with her, and it's pretty clear to everyone that this dog ain’t trained at all. For the past month and a half, Max has done several annoying things which Mira just let happen.

For example, the first week she brought him, he ran in front of my dorm room and took a shit on my welcome mat. Another time, Mira let Max shake himself all over me in the elevator. He had come inside from playing in the snow, so he was filthy. I know it’s petty, but I’m still pissed about that since I had just brought those clothes out of the laundry that morning. Most recently, he ripped a bag of takeout I had (again in the elevator). Mira did reimburse me for that, but it was still annoying since I had to go back out and get food again. Max also starts yelping and barking randomly some days at 3 am, which is inconvenient. Mira says its because he has nightmares apparently.

Yesterday, Mira asked me if I could drop her off on my way home. The city her family lives in is on the way to my town, and she offered to split the gas money with me. She said this was because Max gets anxious on the bus since there are so many people.

I refused. I told Mira (as politely as I could) I couldn’t risk Max randomly taking a shit in my car. Mira got defensive about this and said he wouldn’t, and that she’d warn me to pull over if she thought he would. We argued; she said I was being heartless and didn’t care about Max and cared more about my car. I made a point not to deny that (even though she seemed to wait for me to) and this pissed her off even more.

I ended up driving home on my own.

In the past hour or so, I’ve been getting some text messages from some of my friends saying that Mira is accusing me of abandoning her and Max after I promised to take them. Some people are saying I’ve been an asshole, though I fail to see how.

1au8vl0,AITA for hiding food from my little sister?,"I (15F) am very dedicated to running, and have achieved a lot of success this year. I run cross country and track, and while the seasons aren’t going on I am constantly conditioning. I run for over an hour every day, and because of my dedication (and some lucky genetics) I’ve been selected for my schools varsity team as a freshman. I just broke 24 mins on a 5k. Since I’ve been exercising so much, my appetite has increased a lot as well. My younger sister “Beth” (12F) has noticed and decided that it’s her job to count my calories. She comments on every meal or snack I eat, and it has been really bugging me. This came to a climax recently, I got home from track practice, made dinner for my family (1st time making lasagna!). As soon as she sat down, the first thing Beth did was stare at my plate and say “that’s a big portion for a big girl!!!” (I’m 5’6” and weigh less than 100 pounds). My parents lightly scolded her, but I was still pissed since I made dinner and she was mocking me. It was a whole tray of lasagna, there was plenty for everybody. I brushed it off, but it bothered me. Later that night, I was studying and needed a snack. I went into the kitchen and cut up some strawberries. Beth jumped around the corner and yelled “GOTCHA FATTY!” Obviously her insults are sub par, but I was really upset. For context, we have plenty of food in the house. My parents don’t starve us or anything, which is why I don’t get why she’s acting this way. She then had the audacity to report me eating strawberries to my mom. Obviously my mom didn’t care, but didn’t care to discipline her either. So after she went to bed, I took a portion of food in the pantry and hid it in my room for me to eat. I wanted to be able to have snacks without someone judging my eating habits. My mom found the food in my room the next day, and is mad at me. I’m not allowed to keep food in my room. I understand that, and it is her house, and I told her why I was hiding food in my room. She told me I needed to be quieter while snacking to avoid conflict, or “eat less”. I felt awful, because she was implying I eat too much. I’m not at a point right now that I can eat just 3 meals a day. I’m running a minimum of 25 miles of week, and something’s gotta give. I’m afraid it’s gonna be my body. My mom took my phone, but I don’t care anymore. I plan to do the exact same thing again, but hide the food better this time.

1bsniht,AITA For not specifying that my sibling is a man?,"My older brothers name is Viktor but no one has ever called him that. Ever. Everyone calls him Vik. I call him Vikky, something I started as a kid. He's like ten years older than me, doesn't live at home, yada yada.

Anyway we're going on our family vacation in a week. I was allowed to invite a friend. I invited a friend from my dance class - we've gotten pretty close recently. I told her we'd be sharing a room with Vik. She was fine and we started planning our trip.

Anyway yesterday my friend came over - she's never met Vik, obviously, and our parents wanted her to meet him before we fly because he'll basically be responsible for us (our parents pair the kids off so they get to relax).

When she got introduced to him she immediately, like, freaked out, and told me she no longer wanted to go and got her parents to tale her straight back home. I was obviously upset and I didn't know what had happened.

She called me later and said shebwas upset because I'd never told her Vik is a man. I was confused because like, yeah, I'd never outright called him a man but I've definitely called him ""he"" before and referred to him as my brother.

I said this to her and she told me she never called me call him ""he"" (blamed my accent) and that she assumed ""brother"" meant my other brothers (I have seven).

She told me she doesn't feel comfortable sharing a room with a grown man for a week and no longer wants to come. I'm really, really upset, but feel like if it was that big of a deal for her she should have asked?

I told her she was being unreasonable. Like, fair enough she shouldn't go if she's uncomfortable, but it's not my fault she didn't ask. She thinks I should have been upfront about it.

My parents think I'm being mean, my brothers are divided. So AITA?

1b9893v,AITA for taking my grandchildren to Disney for the first time without their mother and refusing to apologize when confronted?,"My son made this account and asked me to post this story, because he claims my normal meter is skewed and the internet is going to tell me I am an asshole.

I recently babysat my grandchildren (5 and 4) for a period of four nights and five days so my son and his wife could attend a wedding in Mexico, and spend a few days on vacation. They approached me since her mother would not be available, and I initially said I wasn't comfortable with that. It seemed like a long time to watch the kids, and she has point blank told me that the woman's family is more important than the man's, so I was irritated I was being asked and not her mother. I will admit that I did give in when my son became very emotional, but I felt/feel like they were being manipulative.

While I had the kids I was invited to a birthday at Epcot and wanted to go. It didn't even occur to me to run it by my son or daughter in law, as I had the kids for an extended period of time and obviously they knew they would be going where I went. My daughter in law had previously mentioned wanting to save up for Disney, but she's said that about a lot of things, and never made me aware it was something super special to her. Also it was Epcot. It's not like I took them to Magic Kingdom and they had some magical moment of seeing their favorite character. 

When they returned and found out my daughter in law was furious and burst into tears. She said I stole one of her kids first and called me entitled. To be honest I didn't react well to being called entitled, when she was the one who had previously demanded babysitting. My son asked me to apologize as she was distraught over missing their first Disney trip, but I declined and asked them to leave. 

My son reached out again and said I should have asked for something that big, and his wife feels robbed. I know she is a huge Disney person, but it was Epcot, not quintessential Disney and I don't feel I should have had to miss out on a birthday party I wanted to attend. I told my son I am not apologizing for anything and maybe they should think about how they made me feel when they didn't respect my initial no. My son feels like Reddit is going to show me the error of my ways.

Her mother wanted nothing to do with her when she was born. When I met my wife, she was worried about being a bad step-mother to my daughter. They became close and they do a spa day every mother's day. 

My daughter has very long hair down to her shoulders. She hates putting it up in ponytails and she complains about the length of time it takes to blow-dry. She's a big tom-boy and one of her friends recommended she gets a pixie cut. I booked her an appointment to get the cut she wanted and she was very happy. She's been in such a great mood and loves having the short hair. 

When I brought her home to see wife, my wife dropped what she was doing and looked like she was about to faint. She asked why I allowed daughter to cut all her hair off. I told her that this is the cut my daughter wanted. My wife got furious and started telling me about how I ruined daughter's image. I shot back at her to get over the hair-cut as it made daughter happy. That was all I wanted was my daughter to be happy 

My wife continued to complain about the haircut even around my daughter and I had to tell her multiple times to drop it. My daughter has been very depressed and it's worrying me. I have been giving my wife the cold shoulder and she's being very cold to both me and daughter.

1b481pf,AITA For Expecting My Wife To Do Most Of The Pool Upkeep?,"I (36m) and my wife (35f) purchased our house 3 years ago. When we were in the market for houses, my wife stated that she explicitly wanted a pool. I didn't really care too much for a pool, but we had a flexible budget so I guess why not? I requested though, that if we bought one, she would have to do 80% of the upkeep, if not all of it. She agreed.

But luckily, I have two employees that are extremely helpful: My son (7M) and my daughter (6F). Very well paid, no complaints so far.

By the time we were heating to bed, I asked her if she could clean it on Saturday (or I could help) but she hit me with the ""I'm busy."" She doesn't work on Saturday. I got kidn of upset about it and told her that she should be doing 100% of the upkeep anyways and I'm going to stop taking care of the pool from now.

1bq9tze,AITA for refusing to take any responsibility for my dog until my wife was forced to rehome him?,"I am going to lay this out of n the most basic way I can. 

I work from home. As does my wife. She wanted a dog. I said we did not have enough time to take care of a dog. She pestered me until I agreed. We took our time and found a rescue that had several pups that met our criteria. Small. Adult. Requiring just a couple of short walks a day. They did home visits and stuff. 

It was taking a while. During that time my wife found a farm that had working Blue Heeler X Border Collie pups. She got me one for my birthday. I had one just like her when I lived at home with my parents. 

She is a beautiful puppy but not in any way what we agreed on. We live in an apartment with no yard. My parents have an acreage. I a very busy. I do not have time for all the training and exercise that she needs.  I told my wife thanks but no thanks. She refused to listen to me. 

So I just refused to bond with the pup. I didn't even name her. I told my wife I would make sure that the pup was fed and got two half hour walks a day since that's what we agreed on. Everything else was on her. 

It took two weeks o barking, chewing, and pooping until she rehomed the pup. Now she is mad that I manipulated her into doing what I said we should do to begin with.

1bcfrxs,AITA for asking my mother to leave because she won't stop wasting my food.,"My baby sister just had a baby and our mom came to help. My sister and her husband live in a tiny apartment with no room for my mom. I agreed to let her stay with me since I live only eight blocks away. It's walkable. My plan was to Uber her over in the morning and pick her up after work. 

I only eat one meal a day during the week. Supper. I have coffee for breakfast and some fruit for lunch. On Saturday I treat myself to a good breakfast and Sundays I take the woman I'm dating for brunch. 

My mother decided that this was unacceptable. She got up early and went through my fridge and freezer to make me breakfast. 

I told her that I appreciate it but that I do not usually eat breakfast. She said that was stupid. I very clearly communicated to her that she was welcome to eat anything in my home but to please not make me breakfast as it was a waste. 

She made breakfast the following day. I walked out without eating it. I figured worst case scenario I could  eat it for supper. 

She threw it out since I didn't eat it. I told her once more to please not waste my food. 

She made breakfast for me the next day. I asked her if she was developing dementia. She is wasting my food for no good reason. I'm not poor or anything but wasting food is a pet peeve of mine. She said I was being ungrateful for her help and she was doing it to be nice since I was letting her stay with me. 

I explained to her again that I did not need, want, require, or desire breakfast during the week. She said she understood. 

She made me breakfast the next day. I had had enough. I took her luggage with me when I dropped her off at my sister's home. 

I told my doorman that my guest was no longer welcome. 

I got so many messages from her and my sister all day long. Even my dad called me to ask me to change my mind. I said no. 

He had to drive up and rent an Airbnb close to my sister because my mom was too scared to stay by herself. He's retired so he didn't miss work or anything. 

My sister came over alone to talk to me. She said I was being a complete ass and that I could afford the food my mom was wasting. I said I could but that I didn't want to. She literally used up two months worth of my food. She made up huge breakfasts that I didn't even eat. I keep all my bacon in individual servings. She thawed out three for every breakfast. One for her and two for me. And I ate zero. 

My father has asked me to let her back in. I said I would under the condition that she understand that my food is completely off limits to her. She can pay for her own food. I said I would make room in the fridge and freezer for her. She said I was being ridiculous and petty.  

So my dad is staying neutral but my mom and sister think I'm a jackass.

1bm6875,AITA for telling my mom that she's doesn't get to make the rules?,"I (17M) live with my three brothers (15M, 13M, 10M), and my ma (40F). We're not very well off. I pay almost half the rent, I pay for groceries more often than not, and I juggle having a job, going to school, and raising these three kids, one of whom is disabled.

I say raising, because my ma, between having two jobs and basically never being home, doesn't contribute. She's gone by 8am, and usually not back before 10 or 11pm. In the past year, she's been home even less, getting home later and later. I'm pretty sure she goes out drinking.

The fight went like this: My ma came home last night a bit before 9pm for once, instead of 11 or later as she's been doing. 15M came out of his room to say hi, and 13M was already on the couch reading something for school, so she hugged both of them, and said hi, and said she'd stopped by the gas station to buy us all something and gave us all a candy bar, which was cool of her. Then, she asked where 10M was, because she wanted to say hi to him.

Now, I've practically raised these kids on my own for years now. And I do my best. On the very rare occasion my mom comes home early, she usually just goes to bed.

I have 10M go to bed at 8pm, which I don't think is unreasonable, and I let the other two stay up until 10pm, because they're older. We all eat dinner at 6, get home from school around 4, and have a pretty clean routine altogether.

Now, my ma was asking where he was, so I told her he was asleep. She asked why, so I told her it's past his bedtime. She told me he didn't have to go to bed that early. I told her he did. She told me no he didn't, she'd said we could all stay up until 10. 

I said that doesn't work, and she told me she's the parent, and it does work. And then she said it's not my place to micromanage the other three. she said, her kids, her house, her rules. And then she exploded, that I could stop being such a control- freak, because it wasn't my place to do that, or to have signed up 13M for soccer, or to have repainted the fence, or to have taken 10M to the doctor some weeks ago, or any of the things I've been doing without asking her.

I told her, it's also my house, I pay a lot of rent, and they're basically my kids, because she's never around, so it's more my house, my rules, if we wanna play that game. I told her she wouldn't know what works for 10M, because she's too busy to know him. I told her I might ask for her input if she was ever around, but she never is, so I don't give a shit how she thinks I should raise these kids, and she doesn't get to have a say in it. Not anymore.

She broke down crying, called me ungrateful ""for all that she does"" said she ""doesn't know where she went wrong"" and left the room. She either went to her room or she fucked off and left the house, idk and idc. She's an adult, it's her life. 13M said I'm a dick for making her cry, and 15M left the room a minute later, saying he was going to bed.

1bavkf0,AITA for leaving a barcrawl early without my girlfriend?,"I (27 M) just got home about 45 minutes ago and am currently dealing with my very pissed off gf (29 F). We have been dating since November after meeting off of hinge. 

Every year, the weekend before St Patrick’s day weekend, her friend from highschool “Dean” has a birthday barcrawl. A lot of people go; there must have been like 40 people there. My gf has known dean since highschool and she even dated him for a bit then. We are much older now so that doesn’t bother me. 

What bothered me is that my gf basically barely talked to me the entire time we were there. We got to the pregame around noon and went to the first bar at like 2 PM. She kept running off with her friends and I didn’t know a single person who was there. These aren’t friends she sees that often so I’ve never met them before. I spent most of my time at the first 3 bars looking for her. She was pretty drunk and hyper and I know she was looking forward to seeing these friends but it still felt like she ditched me. 

I even expressed to her that if she wanted to go without me it would be okay because I am kind of shy and not great with large groups of people i don’t know. She insisted that I go however so I did. Only for her to not be around me most of the time. 

When it came time to go to the third bar, I found her and told her I had an Uber coming back to my apartment and she can come over when she’s done. I said I didn’t care at all if she wanted to stay but I was done and didn’t really feel wanted at all. She tried to get me to stay but I insisted it was all good but I just wanted to leave. 

Now she is saying she’s not gonna come over and she’s mad at me for leaving. Even making snide remarks about how I don’t let myself socialize. So was I an asshole here?",Crazypaddythrowaway,5176,1,1.0,0.2429480467837121,1710027058,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1bavkf0/aita_for_leaving_a_barcrawl_early_without_my/,2024,3,AmItheAsshole,2024-03-09 23:30:58
1bbmrxj,AITA for telling my sister she doesn’t have a say in my nieces diet,"I adopted my 8 year old niece 5 years ago. Her parents just weren’t fit to be parents. They are still involved in her life as her aunt and uncle. 

My niece is homeschooled. She goes to a co op 4.5 hours a day, 4 days a week. I work 3 12 hour shifts a week so I usually need help getting her to and from co op 1-3 days a week. My sister works nights and is available to take her. Since it’s a bit of a drive back to the house, she usually hangs out at the co op and helps out with whatever they need. 

One mom at the co op makes lunches for the kids as her contribution. She has all of their allergy/dietary info and none of the kids have complained so far. Some examples of their lunches are turkey/ham sandwich, pb&j, mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, hot dogs, and occasionally pizza. 

She also gives them sides like a cracker (goldfish, cheezits, chips, ritz, veggie straws, etc.), some kind of fruit (fruit slices, fruit cups, apple sauce), some kind of dessert (fruit snacks, cookie, brownie, etc), and a drink (usually milk or juice). 

My sister told my niece that she doesn’t want her eating that crap and that when she takes my niece to co op, she’ll be packing my niece a lunch. Apparently she told my niece that carbs are bad for her and that these lunches will make her fat. 

My niece came to me upset about it because she likes those lunches and that’s what everyone else eats. I told her that my sister was wrong then sent her to play before calling my sister. 

My sister defended everything she said and I told her that if she has concerns about my nieces diet, she will need to speak to me about it, not my niece. I also told her that I am my nieces parent, not her, and that if she feels that she has the power to make unilateral decisions regarding her health without consulting me I will get her a babysitter that can take her to co op. 

A lot of my family is against me on this and says that it’s my sisters kid so she should have a say and that me getting a babysitter will be cruel to both my niece and my sister (she already stays with my neighbor during the day but my neighbor can’t take her to co op).

1batxxj,AITA for being honest when my dad asked where my mom was on my wedding morning?,"I recently married my beautiful wife ""Amanda"" She isn't the biggest fan of my mom and that is probably mutual idk. Amanda knows I am on her side and here to support any boundaries. She was concerned about how my mom would behave at the wedding and admitted to not wanting to spend any more time with her than absolutely necessary.

I ended up going to my mom's husband ""Chris"" and asking if he had any thoughts so we could all have  a peaceful day and no bridesmaids would need to ""accidently"" spill anything. At first he didn't want to help, but he didn't want my mom to feel embarrassed and gave in. He said it was already going to be a long day for her, so he recommended no pre wedding festivities and said he would get her out of the rehearsal dinner early, so she had enough time in between. He took her out right after dinner and took her somewhere else.

The day of the wedding she was not invited to get ready with the bridal party or have a champagne breakfast. Instead Chris took her to the beach for a long run (get that energy out) Then took her to a nice breakfast, home for some one on one attention, and let her know he had a special day planned the following day. She got her makeup done at their house and came just in time for the wedding. 

My stepmom ""Lexi' was however invited to get ready with the bridal party. I guess she told my dad my mom wasn't there and he asked me. I told him the truth that Chris was taking care of her as it would be too long a day for her. I guess he told someone else because my mom found out and was furious.

She asked how I could humiliate her and said I'm a shitty son. She said I could have said nothing and accused me of not loving her. She said she knows the truth that we just don't like her or want her around.

1ba03qq,AITA for uninviting my friend from my Oscar party over a bottle of whisky?,"All names are fake.

Me (29M) and my wife ""Kate"" (27F) host an Oscar watch party at our house every year. We've been doing that since we moved in together 5 years ago. We dress up well, place bets on the winners and eat popcorn. It's a fun tradition that many of our friends look forward to every year. One of those people is ""Rick"" (28M), a friend of mine from college.

My wife loves whisky. Shortly before last year's party, my FIL gave her a bottle of Macallan. He said he'd spent $175 on it. Kate gave birth to our first child in 2022 and was still breastfeeding last year, so she decided to save the bottle for after our son had weaned.

During last year's watch party, Rick got wasted. While reaching for something else in our liquor cabinet, he accidentally dropped and broke the bottle. He apologized profusely once he'd sobered up. I was angry, but the whisky was Kate's and she forgave him, so I decided to drop the subject.

A couple weeks after that, we asked Rick how he planned on replacing the bottle. He was shocked at our question, and told us he didn't intend to. Rick's been having money problems for a while and struggles to pay his rent. He said that since we knew about his condition, it was unreasonable of us to expect him to pay for a $175 bottle of whisky.

I told Rick he had until this year's Oscar party (which was months away at the time) to save up for a new bottle. If he didn't, he wouldn't be welcome at our place for the party. At the time, he agreed. Throughout the year, I asked him about the savings several times. He always told me he was close to the goal.

Last week, I asked Rick about it again. He confessed he hadn't actually saved any money for the bottle. So I kept my promise and uninvited him from the party.

Both Rick and his girlfriend (who frequently joins him at our parties) are now angry at me for uninviting him over a ""drunken mistake."" They also insist that I'm being unsympathetic and entitled by expecting Rick to pay for a new bottle.

Kate's on my side, but is worried we're being too harsh. I really don't think we are, but as Sunday approaches, I'm starting to feel guilty.

I have less than two days to sort this out. AITA?",InternationalList333,4370,1,1.0,0.2051644353079949,1709933973,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ba03qq/aita_for_uninviting_my_friend_from_my_oscar_party/,2024,3,AmItheAsshole,2024-03-08 21:39:33
1bixndd,AITA for not forgiving my MIL after she gave away my late mother’s heirloom to a stranger?,"I (30F) am known in my family for my patience and generosity. I’ve always gone out of my way to help others, and I take pride in being a good person. My husband (32M) and I have a beautiful relationship built on mutual respect and understanding.  
My late mother left me a precious heirloom, a vintage necklace that has been in our family for generations. It’s not just valuable, but it holds immense sentimental value to me. I’ve always kept it safe and only wore it on special occasions, cherishing the memories it holds.  
Enter my MIL (57F), who has a history of overstepping boundaries. Despite our differences, when she lost her apartment, my husband and I opened our home to her, asking for nothing in return but basic respect for our belongings.  
One day, I came home to find my MIL hosting a tea party with her friends, and to my horror, one of her friends was wearing my mother’s necklace. When I confronted her, my MIL nonchalantly said she gave it away because she thought it was ‘just old jewelry’ and that her friend admired it.  
I was heartbroken and felt utterly betrayed. My husband was equally appalled and supported my decision to ask her to leave. Now, the rest of the family is painting me as the villain, saying I’m overreacting and should forgive her because ‘family is family.’

1bsn0nn,AITA for not attending my daughters 18 birthday because my step daughter was giving birth,"I’ve four kids (18f,14m,12m,) who are biologically mine and my step daughter (17f) 

The only relevant people to this story are my bio daughter Emily and Lora my step daughter  

I’ve been in my step daughters life since she was 6 years old I see her as a daughter I swore I’d never be like my step father and treat a child differently because of something silly like dna, emliy hates Lora and has turned her brothers against her even slut shamed her when she found out she was pregnant which resulted in a fall out between me and Emily    

Basically my wife tried to have civil conversation about Emily always staying up all night and sleeping all day when she came here (every weekend) saying emliy can’t spend every week end in bed which Emily pointed to Lorax’s stomach saying “looks like you need to have that conversation with our own daughter and from what I’ve heard she’s been in multiple beds every weekend” which Lora caused who was already depressed to break down 


Emily and I began rebuilding our relationship lately she even invited me to her 18th unfortunately during the party my wife called me to say Lora went into labour, emliy and my ex demanded I stay because she was my daughter not Lora 
I tried explaining I was all Lora had outside her mother and please understand, emliy said if I leave I’d not only lose her but my sons for someone else’s kid and I was no better than my father who walked out on me 

Which hurt and I knew I had to leave, Lora had a baby boy who will be named after me and she’s even asked me to officially adopt them both which brought tears to my eyes

1b993fj,AITA for telling my son that he should've told me about his girlfriend's dietary restrictions?,"My son (25M) started seeing a new girl named Lexi around a year and a half ago. She lives a few hours away, but they see each other often enough. I'd never met her personally until now. I don't know much about her, but she makes my son happy and seems to have a good head on her shoulders. That's all that matters to me. 

Last Friday, we hosted a barbecue and party, around 25-30 people. It was mostly family and friends. My son asked me if he could bring Lexi, and I told him that it was fine. We had ribs, burgers and wings, as well as some sides that didn't have meat.

What my son didn't communicate to me, or to anyone else handling the food, was that Lexi is a very particular eater and wouldn't be able to eat anything we served. Lexi is Catholic and can't eat meat on Fridays. My son was aware of this and invited her to a barbecue knowing what would be served. On top of that, she also has a sort of ED (ARFID) that limits what kinds of foods she will/can eat without feeling sick.

She was really sweet, and I enjoyed her company, but I felt terrible watching her sit without food. When I asked if she'd eaten beforehand, she told me that yes, and that she wasn't hungry. I asked my son separately why he'd gone out to eat right before a barbecue, and he told me that that they'd come straight from her house. So I asked him if she didn't like the food, to which he explained why she couldn't eat the meat, and that she wouldn't eat any of the sides either. Since he didn't say anything beforehand, I asked her myself.

I asked Lexi if there was anything I could get or make her, or if she wanted us to run somewhere and pick something up. She asked if I had any fruit, so she had fruit salad. After everything was sorted out my son came up to me and told me that I'd embarrassed her and shouldn't have drawn attention to it. I told him that he should have tried harder to accommodate her, or to at least tell us beforehand that she wouldn't be able to eat what everyone else was. We easily could have made some plain salad or had fruit available at no hassle for anyone else, and she would at least be able to pick at something instead of going hungry. If it were addressed beforehand then I wouldn't have had to ask. 

My son left in a huff to bring Lexi home, and he's still insisting that I made a bad impression and that it wouldn't have been a big deal if she didn't eat. Apparently I made her anxiety worse, but that's according to him, so I'm not sure I believe it. AITA?

1bfrtju,AITA for letting my wife’s friend quit causing her to lose multiple benefits totaling in $50k+?,"I (35M) worked with my wife’s close friend Sara (29F) who she has know since college. They were sorority sisters and my wife was her big and Sara was the little or something along those lines. Sara and I were in the same industry and she eventually applied for a position at the same Company I currently worked at. She got the job almost 3 yrs ago and we have been at the same midwestern office. She was apart of my team but I dealt very little with her directly and wasn’t her direct report. 

Sara had done very well and was promoted within 6 months to a good position. She seemed to be on a fast track but recently stumbled in her latest interview for a sought after position. We gave the position to a more deserving candidate in my eyes. As we sometimes see Sara was upset and it was the start of her leaving the company. I could sense she was applying elsewhere and did put in a 2 weeks notice, offered to stay on 1 month inline with her projects deadline, which we accepted. We wanted to keep Sara but I could not give her a raise because she was already at the top of her pay scale. Her job offer was actually lower pay so there was no leverage there either. I told her this within a few days and Sara was pretty upset. She decided to leave immediately.

Here is where the issue comes up. Sara was aggressive with her 401k and the company stock options by my recommendation. We have a 10% 401k match (very generous) and stock buying options (match stock purchases - basically a 2 for the price of 1 deal). She would tell me later she maxed the 401k and stock options every year. The problem is my company has a 3 yr vesting schedule before the matching is permanent. So if an employee leaves before both 401k and stock matching is gone. Sara’s 3yr anniversary was within the 1 month notice date but not when she abruptly quit. 

It something I realize between Sara’s notice and her quitting. I wasn’t able to advise her of this nor did I know how much she put into these program. There was really nothing I could do when she abruptly quit. 

It was about 2 months later Sara came over with my wife and laid into me. She tried transferring her funds and found out about the vesting period and asked if I knew. She revealed the amount she would be losing during the transfer of funds and it was greater than $50k. Both Sara and my wife have said I’m TA for not warning her. I told her the situation and how I did not consider her quitting immediately (in front of others too).

So AITA for not warning Sara that she was just short of the 3 yr vesting period that would’ve saved for $50k?

1blczql,AITA for not getting my “stepdaughter” a present?,"I (F40) got married to my ex-husband, James (M43), three years ago. He had a daughter, Annabel (F13) from a previous marriage. For background purposes, Annabel has next to no contact with her bio mother. She left when Annabel was two, and apart from the occasional birthday card, there’s no contact there.

I’ve known Annabel since she was nine, and we had a good relationship, especially in the absence of a maternal figure in her life. I never had children of my own and never intended to, but was surprised that I was fine with being in a relationship with someone with a child.

James, Annabel, and I lived together for four years in what you could consider the “normal” nuclear family. However, my relationship with James just got more and more strained. We were constantly arguing and bickering about really pointless things and the atmosphere in the house was sour. Annabel could tell and she became more withdrawn. Eventually, I told James I was leaving because I wasn’t happy in the house or the relationship. He was livid, swearing and shouting, saying that he didn’t want to see me again. I left and went to live with my sister until I found somewhere of my own.

This happened about three months ago, and I haven’t had any contact with James since then, other than to collect some things from the house. I asked how Annabel was, and he said she was fine, but didn’t really expand upon that. 

However, last week, I received an angry call from James saying how selfish and immature I’d been my not getting Annabel a birthday present. I knew it was her birthday but decided not to and haven’t tried to maintain a relationship with her because of the tension with James. James said how upset she was and that he couldn’t believe I put relationship issues over a 13 year old girl, who I knew didn’t have a mother. I told him he was being ridiculous and that if he wanted to cut me out of his life completely, that includes his daughter.

He said I was an asshole and a small gift or card would have meant the world to Annabel, before hanging up the phone. 

I sent Annabel a happy birthday text (the day after her birthday as the call was late), but she hasn’t responded.

 I’d been telling my family since I first got hired that they ALL need to come.

This was an extrenely big deal to me and I’m very upset that she won’t just not go to the rave and come to my dinner. 

I rarely ask her to go places and she always flakes out and says she’s “tired” but has the energy to go out with friends every week. she then said if i gave her the money she spent then shed be able to go but also said id have to reimburse her boyfriend too, which i refused. not because i dont like him but because i dont want to pay 600 for my sister to come to an event i had been telling her about for months. She said unless i did that she can’t go, and im extremely upset and offended that my own damn sister would rather go to a rave then her brothers probationary dinner since this is like a wedding or graduation and not going is extremely messed up.

I pay a reduced rent but I work for the school so I'm getting shit pay and still pay a decent amount of my paycheck for rent. Only me and my roommate are on our lease, however it's not uncommon for my roommate's girlfriend to stay with us for a while. As in multiple weeks at a time. So much that it's caused a noticeable increase in our power and water bill. It also causes a hassle when getting ready. She obviously takes super long in the shower and bathroom, uses all the hot water and leaves hair in the sink and shower which I refuse to clean. 

All of this has lead me to feel that she needs to go. I have a pretty busy schedule so I rarely see my roommate with enough freetime to tell him to kick her out, but I do see her pretty often. Yesterday, I got done at the gym and came home to shower before work and she was in the bathroom. I told her I needed to get ready for work and she said she wouldn't be too long. 

I ended up going back to the gym to shower and was late to work waiting on her. I get home and my roommate is now at work and she's in the living room. I tell her that she needs to get her own place to live. I said I cannot deal with another person here, she lives here for free and I don't want her her so she needs to get out by the morning. 

At around 11 I am woken up by my roommate yelling at me and calling me a bully for what I did and accused me of being jealous since I don't have a girlfriend. I told him that I wouldn't have said that if he made sure she wasn't imposing. He's still mad and she's still here so it's been awkward lately. He

1bmybct,AITA for not inviting my ex best friend to my wedding even though I was the MOH at hers?,"I (31F) had a friend Maria (31F) growing up. We met when we were about 8 or 9, and quickly became best friends. We started slowly growing apart in high school as our schedules changed and almost completely lost touch during college. By the time we were \~23, we only saw each other once a year at Christmas for our old friend group’s Christmas dinner.  


Maria got engaged to her high school sweetheart and asked me to be her maid of honor in the wedding. At the time she asked me, we had not seen or spoken to each other in almost 2 years, so it honestly shocked me when she asked, but I agreed. She asked me about a year before the wedding, and after she asked me to be MOH, she did not speak to me again for 6 months. I had taken it to mean maybe she wanted to rekindle our friendship and reached out a few times during those 6 months to meet up for lunch or hang out, but she never responded.  


When she finally texted me, it was to meet up with her and her best friend (one of the bridesmaids) to pick out the dresses for the bridal party. She showed up 3 HOURS LATE. Apparently, she and her friend decided to meet up for lunch and to hang out before meeting me at the mall, completely ignoring our agreed upon time and the fact that I had already said I was there and waiting for them. I’m not going to go into details of the next 6 months leading up to the wedding, but that should give you an idea of how it went. By the time the wedding day came, I genuinely felt so used and disrespected. On the day of the wedding, Maria was just mean. I waited until the speeches and the first dance were over, then I left the reception and went home. I have not spoken to her since.  


It's been about 4 years since her wedding, and I am now engaged and getting married in 2 months. I did not invite Maria or any of our old friend group. In my mind, our friendship is well and truly dead. Apparently, Maria ran into my sister at a store and were chatting and my sister mentioned the wedding. Maria texted me (honestly shocked she still has my number) to send me her address “so I knew where to send her invitation” and I just responded “thank you, but the guest list is already set. have a nice day”. She told the friend group and now they’re all blowing up my phone about inviting them ‘for old time’s sake’ and that I owe at least Maria an invitation because I was her MOH. They’ve been posting on social media and now even my mom is getting involved, saying I should invite them all just to keep the peace and out of respect for our old friendship.

  
My argument is that I haven’t spoken to them in years, and I don’t care about this ‘wedding etiquette’ thing and I don’t owe her an invitation just because I was her MOH, especially considering everything that happened with her wedding. But literally only my fiancé is on my side. So, AITA?

1bcgc6d,AITA For Giving My Wife The Cold Shoulder After She Donated Our Vacation Fund?,"I (41m) and my wife (39f) are people who like to travel. We take our kids (12f and 14f) on trips 2-3 times a year. And over the year I usually put aside money for travel. My wife's niece also needs knee surgery due to soccer injuries (soccer season ended a month or so ago) and my sister-in-law can't really afford it. I'm not sure how much health insurance will cover or how much the surgery will even cost, but they've been looking for help to pay for it. 

&#x200B;

Well after we booked flights and stuff, we had about 15k-20k left in the account. We didn't really know what to do with it yet.  

&#x200B;

FF to this morning, and my wife and I are talking about attractions and stuff and my wife kind of sneaks in to the conversation that we would have to pay out of pocket since she gave the remaining money to her sister. I was absolutely fucking livid because a) That was our money in the account, which means my money was also in the account and b) I'm SURE they don't need that much, especially if they have insurance which will most likely cover some of the surgery cost. 

&#x200B;

Since then, I went to work, came back, and haven't spoken to her since. She's tried to talk about it, but I don't want to talk about anything except my money getting back into my account. I feel bad for ignoring my wife and giving her shade but at the same time I'm really fucking pissed. AITA?

1bda5i9,AITA for threatening to cancel a cruise because my girlfriend wants to bring her dog? ,"I(26M) and my girlfriend(27F) have been together for about 2 years. We don't live together, but live about an hour away. She recently adopted a pit-mix from the shelter and the dog is horrible. Her growls and snarls whenever I visit her and she brings it with her when she visits me. I have a cat which I keep locked away when the dog visits as I don't trust it.  She brings it everywhere with her. 

She has been talking about going on a cruise as her parents came back from one that went to the Bahamas. I found a good deal on one to the Carribean. I booked it and sent my girlfriend the details. She's super excited and mentioned that she was even more excited that the dog could come. I immediately told her that the dog was not coming as I was not going to put people at risk and have the vacation ruined. Her parents are more than happy to watch the dog when we go away, but she is trying to fight me on bringing the dog along. 

I then told her that if she continue to press the matter about bringing the dog, I would cancel the cruise. She got pissed at me and started sending me horrible messages and telling our mutual friends that I was trying to separate her from the dog. I haven't spoken to her all day as I need space and time to think. She clearly sees me as the AH and trying to paint me as the bad guy.

1b6pymg,AITA for throwing a piece of popcorn at someone who kept using their phone during a movie?,"The title is pretty self-explanatory... but here are the details...

We went to see Dune 2 (HIGHLY recommended) last night... in a VIP theatre with comfy seats and table service... which I mention because to attend, you must be 19+ -- they serve real drinks.

Seated two rows ahead of us, were three young women... 19-22 I'd guess.

They didn't shut up during any of the previews, and spoke loudly to each other throughout the movie... which is annoying, but, unfortunately, hardly unique these days.

But what was incredibly annoying... starting at about 20 minutes into the movie, one of them got onto her phone. She was only two rows ahead and it was full brightness, so it'd be an understatement to say it was distracting. She'd text, scroll instagram, watch TikTok videos... for a few minutes... then put it down. Ten minutes later, out came the phone again. 

After the third time, I said, quite loudly, ""Put the phone away!"" She looked back, gave me a look like ""STFU old man"", but put it down. And then, 10 minutes later, pulled it out again. Again, full brightness.

So I got a piece of popcorn and threw it at her... hit her on the head. As you can imagine, she turned around... ""Are you fuckin serious right now?!""

""Yeah, I'm serious, can't you live without your phone for a couple of hours?""

""Shhh!"", said someone

""Shut up!"", said someone else.

She put it away... and then, maybe 20 minutes later, out it came again.

I threw another piece of popcorn, which barely missed but flew by her face. She put the phone away and it stayed away for the rest of the movie.

Nobody stood, nobody clapped, nobody really cared. And that might have been the end of it, except after the movie, she quite bluntly said to her friend as we were walking out, looking at me, ""That's the asshole.""

In telling others about this this morning, I've come to understand that movie etiquette has changed from when I was 20. Back then, of course, there weren't phones... but it was unheard of to engage in behaviour that'd be distracting to others. And when phones appeared 30 years ago, you'd NEVER get on it during the movie, and if you had to, you'd walk out and deal with it. But these days, this is par for the course.

Anyway, if I'm paying $25 per ticket plus food plus drinks (expensive!) plus parking for a night out and a true theatre experience, I'd like to enjoy it with what I think is the environment all of that deserves. I can watch movies at home and get on my phone all I want, for free. This is supposed to be different.

Am I out of touch? AITA? Is this ok these days?

And maybe that behaviour is not OK, but AITA for throwing a couple of kernels of popcorn at someone? It was certainly effective.",canada11235813,3410,1,1.0,0.1601616226322027,1709595363,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1b6pymg/aita_for_throwing_a_piece_of_popcorn_at_someone/,2024,3,AmItheAsshole,2024-03-04 23:36:03
1bezcnp,AITA for not giving my house to my SIL?,"Throw away for obvious reasons. This happened 2 nights ago, and I'm still feeling some type of way about it. 

Background: My (30f) husband (32m) has a younger sister (SIL 25f), SIL is currently going through a divorce with 4 children. My husband and I also have 4 children. My husband and I live on a very quiet country back road in our little town, us and his family being the only residences on the road. So both his sisters and their families, and his parents, live within walking distance of our house. 

My husband and I have been married for 7 years and have 4 young children. My husband bought the land we live on from his parents when he was 18, and when we got married, we built a house on it. We designed our house with a big family in mind and designed it to be our forever home. It has never been a thought to move or look elsewhere. 

My SIL is going through a divorce. She is struggling, to say the least. She was in a very toxic relationship with her ex, with her contributing just as much as he was, and he filed for divorce and moved out, leaving the 4 kids with her. 

My mother in law called my husband 2 nights ago and asked if we would come over for a chat. We get there, and my In-Laws and SIL are sitting on the couch like they were staging some kind of intervention, it was just really strange. 

My MIL didn't beat around the bush at all. She explained how SIL's ex was getting the house in the divorce and they would be homeless within the month if we didn't give her our home. It honestly took me a second to comprehend what she even said, because it was so out of left field.

Husband didn't need that second and looked them dead in the eyes and said ""No."" 

In-Laws started telling us things like, ""You guys don't need all that house"" ""You guys can move into one of the new neighborhoods in town"" ""You guys can just built a new house"". 

I offered to open up our playroom and guest bedroom to them until they could find somewhere to live, we have air mattresses and the guest room has a full bath, but that was not good enough apparently. That's when we got up and left. 

They began yelling after us, saying we don't care about the children, family helps family, we're being greedy and selfish, etc etc. I'm Honestly so proud of how we reacted, because my first instinct was to go off and say some hurtful things, but we went just home, to OUR home. 

We love SIL's kids, and obviously do not want them to be homeless, but they don't need MY house at the expense of my own children and family. I don't see why SIL's family deserves my home, what about my kids? 

Now the In-Laws are calling/texting, saying we don't care about the kids, we're selfish and greedy, we're making her homeless, and I'm wondering if maybe we were too quick to say no.

1b5v77r,AITA for suggesting my minimum wage and part time boyfriend pay me back for half of my gas for taking him to and from work everyday?,"My (27 F) boyfriend (36 M) of 8 years works at the Amazon distribution center and I am the one to give him rides to and from work, as he works overnights and I worked days. He does have a friend who takes him to work 1 time a week. I also take him to appointments when needed and to the gym daily. He does not have a car or license at this time due to several unpaid speeding and parking tickets.

So about 3 weeks ago I was laid off from my job in marketing. I was making about $55 an hour and holding things down at home with the mortgage and bills without any issues, so I never found it necessary to ask him for gas money to take him to work and home. I figure he works hard and doesn’t get paid much so why make things worse for him? I fill up my gas tank about one time a week for $60. I understand that he is making only $16 an hour and working only about 24 hours per week. I am also privileged to have gotten an masters degree, so I can see how charging him for gas may be an asshole move. But now that I am unemployed and living on much less from unemployment, I am on a budget. I feel like I’m making changes to my lifestyle such as letting go of my personal training sessions, going natural with my nails and avoiding overconsumption.

So on Thursday I asked him about paying to fill up my tank once every two weeks, and I’ll pay the other two weeks, and he got really upset and told me how much easier life has been for me and how I take that for granted. He also says he doesn’t have the money to pay $120 a month for gas (which is understandable because he only makes about $350 every week) even though I have been paying all the bills since we moved in together 4 years ago. I told him that I am not a free Uber service and I feel taken advantage of at times. He still has avoided talking to me about the matter. Am I the asshole in the situation?


TL;DR I lost my decent paying job and am on unemployment and am asking my minimum wage part time work boyfriend whom is unlicensed to pay for the gas I use to pick him up now due to finances. AITA?

1bm4ocj,AITA for telling a woman with kids to Fuck off for making fun of my dog?,"My husband and I were on vacation and we brought our senior dog, because we take her everywhere. She’s a sweet 14 year old shih tzu/poodle. She’s having joint issues, so when we take her on a city trip, we put her in a dog stroller so we can walk around. 

So we were navigating a busy sidewalk and this woman, her friend, and their kids, there were at least 4 kids—this woman points at our dog in the stroller and says “oh hell no.” She starts laughing, pulls her friend over, and they and their kids surround the stroller. The woman goes “are you for real? This is not a child. These are children.” Pointing at her kids. As if I was cosplaying a parent by having my dog in a stroller. I am child free by choice and parents like this are so rude. It’s like the world revolves around their kids, and how dare I put my old dog in a stroller. Strollers are for kids only! 

So I told her to F off and get out of my way and pushed the stroller forward to move on. She then starts yelling how dare i cuss in front of her kids. I kept walking and she left us alone, but it ruined my day and I can’t stop thinking about it. I think she’s an asshole, but was I wrong to “swear” in front of her kids? I was pissed off.

1bm6tz7,"AITA? On a Whim, My Husband and I Renewed Our Vows in Las Vegas Elopement Style. Divorcing Sister is Furious, Says We’re “Inconsiderate.”","I’ll try to keep this short (like my sister’s marriage 🙈). Background- My sister 39f) has been married for almost 2 years and in the process of getting an international, contentious divorce. It was a shotgun wedding and both families advised them against it (to no avail). We all saw this coming.

Anyway, last week was my daughter’s Spring Break and on a whim we decided to take a last minute trip to Las Vegas. I (42f) have been jokingly pushing a vow renewal on my husband (of 22 years) for a looooong time. We laugh about it and move on…usually. But right before we left it popped in my mind that doing a vow renewal elopement style would be fun (in the spirit with the last minute nature of our trip). I grabbed a white shirt, a light up plastic ring, a janky bouquet of faux roses, and a dress up tiara for our daughter (the flower girl). I found the absolute cheapest, cheesiest vow renewal package ($69 lol) and we went ahead and said “I still do!” after about a 3 minute ceremony.

It was just something fun for us and we didn’t tell anyone ahead of time or make an announcement of any kind afterward because it was *just fu*n. It was our 8-year-old who went around announcing to everyone (including people on the sidewalk…grocery store…at school) that her parents FINALLY got married. She doesn’t really realize (or care about) the difference between a wedding and a vow renewal so we got some side eye from people we know thinking we’d been lying all this time about being married. Fun times.

My daughter told her cousins and my sister that we got married on our trip. My sister was the Maid of Honor in our real wedding so, obviously, she got that it was a vow renewal. She didn’t say anything in front of the kids but gave me a super fake smile and laugh when she heard. When we had a moment with the kids out of ear shot, she let me have it. She told me it was completely hurtful and inconsiderate for my husband and I to do a vow renewal while she is in the middle of a divorce. Mind you, her divorce has been in the works for 6 months with no end in sight. She told me our vow renewal was “rubbing our marriage in her face” and said we should either have not done the vow renewal or kept it a secret. She hasn’t spoken to me since and this was almost a week ago.

My mom is a people pleaser and refuses to take a side on this one. My friends think my sister is nuts to be mad about it (but maybe they’re biased because they’re *m*y friends!?). And my husband stopped caring about what she thinks/says years ago. We are not close with my dad at all so me, my sister, and my mom are all the close (nuclear) family we have. I don’t want this to become an issue because it was mostly just silly joke decided on last minute. I’m thinking about apologizing to my sister for making her feel bad and just trying to move on. But part of me is refusing to do that because I think she’s being ridiculous. So, kind friends, please tell me, AITA!?

TLDR: my sister says my Las Vegas elopement style vow renewal was inconsiderate because she is going through a divorce.

1b989ly,AITA For Telling A Stranger “Maybe You Could Have The Decency To Mind Your Damn Business”?,"I am a 23 y/o woman, the other two women involved were (and I’m estimating, I don’t know them) were a mother around 45 and her mid-late teenage daughter.

So I just left the pharmacy where this took place and I’m writing this in the car before I head out, but I was waiting in line to pick up my prescription. Line was pretty long, it went all the way down an aisle a few feet from the counter. I’m chilling in line, it’s inching along, and about ten minutes into waiting, this woman and her daughter come out of a different aisle and start browsing the one that the line is in. They’re talking about what they want to get, and suddenly the daughter goes “does something smell like a grease trap to you?” I laugh and turn around and say “yeah, that tends to happen after 11 hours in a kitchen” in a casual, joking tone. The mother makes a face and says “well you smell awful. You could at least have the decency to go home and shower first.”

I didn’t expect a stranger to get nasty with me, and after a long day I didn’t have the grace for it, especially with over an hour of driving ahead of me. I also didn’t feel like explaining to the woman that I had about 1.5 hours of driving ahead, that I wasn’t going home first, and to take this little detour would’ve meant 50 minutes of driving (30 from work to home, 20 from home to pharmacy) instead of 15 (from work to pharmacy). So, I snapped back “well maybe you could have the decency to mind your own damn business!”

She chastised me for being rude and stormed away with her daughter saying she was going to tell the store I’m “mistreating her”. Nothing happened.

I (married/straight/M34) have worked with Toby (fake name M30) for about 2 years. We don’t hangout outside of work, but interact almost everyday and have always gotten along. One day Toby seemed “off” so I asked “Hey, are you ok? You seem off.” After a pause he looked at me seriously and said “I’m gay…” and then stared at me without saying anything else. I didn’t suspect he was gay, but I knew he didn’t ever talk about SO. I responded “Cool!  Is that a recent development?” And he said “Yes, I’ve only told my family.”  I responded, “That’s cool man! Do you still go by He/him/Toby?” Him “Yes.” Me “Ok, well thanks for feeling comfortable enough to tell me” and we went back to work. 

A few days go by and he had told a few other people. One of those people pulled me aside and told me I hurt Toby’s feelings when he told me first. Toby thought I was dismissive in how I responded and it soured his coming out experience. I’ve interacted with Toby a few times since then and it didn’t feel any different than before. 

I responded the way I did because I didn’t want to make a big deal about it. He’s being who he is and I thought making a big scene out of it would cheapen that. Plus, I have no role in his life outside of work. I don’t want to do anything to make work weird for him or me and I’m not sure if I should do/say something or just leave it alone.

1bjqegz,WIBTA if I tell my friend her son is not welcome to stay in my house unless he is responsible for himself?,"For context: My (F31) best friend (F31) is a single mom of a 14 year old boy. She has low contact with her parents because they kicked her out when she got pregnant in High School, so she doesn’t have  a big support system. We are really close and  I’ve always done what I could to help her, her son is my nephew, not in blood, but in every way that counts,   
  
She does everything for her son. I mean everything. He doesn’t even pick up his plate from the table after he finishes eating, she does it for him. While I personally don’t think this is a good way to raise a child, I never gave her my opinion, she never asked for it, it’s not my business how she decided to raise her child and I’m not a mom so how can I give parenting advice?  
  
Last week my friend  had to take a 2 business trip and had another one schedule for next week. She asked me if her son could stay at my house the days she is out of town, because she doesn’t feel comfortable leaving him alone in their house. I agreed and he stayed with me for 2 days last week.   
  
The 2 days were a frustrating experience for the both of us because he kept expecting me to do everything for him, including: packing his back for school, picking up his clothes whenever he dropped them, serving him cereal in the morning, washing his dishes, and waking him up in the morning to go to school. He even blamed me because he missed the school bus because I didn’t make sure he woke up after his alarm rang. I heard his alarm and assumed he was awake.   
  
I’m not eager to repeat this experience. I love that child but he is too old for this I think. BesidesI have  a demanding  job. I don't have time or energy to be the maid/babysitter of a teenage boy even if it’s just two days.   
  
I’m thinking about telling my friend that if she wants her son to stay with me next week he has to be responsible for  himself. I can promise to cook him 3 meals a day, and I can make sure he is up for school, but he needs to pick up his own clothes, pack his own bags, and wash his own dishes, Otherwise he cannot stay. I don’t feel this is unreasonable, but I feel kinda bad putting these conditions because she doesn’t have  a big support system, and if I don’t let him stay at my house it’ll be really hard for her to find somewhere else to drop him off.

1b51stz,"WIBTA if I move out, leaving my chronically ill roommate vulnerable?","I (30sf) live in Los Angeles, where rent is really high.  I live in a house with two roommates (30, 50f).

My 30-year-old roommate, Kay, has been battling an autoimmune chronic illness for a couple of years. She’s not able to eat a lot of foods and has these spells where her energy is drained. 

My 50-year-old roommate Tammy is emotionally immature, doesn’t help out with chores and has a tendency to be really forgetful. For example, she once broke a toilet seat and didn’t bother to replace it before going on a last-minute trip out of town. After I got the delayed utilities payment from her, it came with a poop emoji attached to it. 

I’m responsible for the major utility bills (water, power and internet). It’s hard getting payments from Kay and Tammy because of Kay’s health issues and Tammy’s irresponsibility. They also have two dogs who are very loud and cause a ruckus.

I’ve been having a hard time coping with Kay’s health problems.  It’s horrible for me to say it, but when she is down, she is down. That leaves the majority of household chores, bills, and trash on me.  

I’m in school and working full time.  I can’t stand living like this anymore. Recently, a friend of mine was looking to fill in a roommate vacancy. I will pay more for rent, but the location is closer to my college and my work. 

I feel guilty moving out because of Kay’s health issues. She relies on me to help her get groceries she’s sick. Not to mention, Tammy does f-all to help around the house.

Kay even said that if I move out, it will be bad for her because of her health problems. She says she’s trying to get better, but she’s been saying that for over a year and it’s affecting my life too.

1bso2ou,AITA for not wanting my kids to have a relationship with their half-brother?,"Over a year ago my husband found out that he had a biological son, Theo (25M), that he didn't know about. My husband and I have three children Maisie (20F), Millie (17F), and Max (15M). 

After finding out the kids initially had mixed emotions about it.

8 months ago my husband and Theo met for the first time. 2 months after that we had him to stay for the weekend. Upon meeting him I immediately felt on edge and he did very little to change my opinion.

First of all, he continued to smoke/vape in our guest room after I asked him not to multiple times. I also caught him smoking weed in the backyard ( it is illegal in our state). On the Saturday night he went out with my husband and they didn't come back until early the next day completely wasted. Previously to that my husband hadn't drunk heavily for years.

My kids really enjoyed spending time with their half-brother, as did my husband. Because of this I decided to mostly hold my tongue about my feelings towards him. 

My husband has met up with his son almost every month since and the kids have seen him a couple more times too.

Around 3 weeks ago, my husband went with Theo to visit Theo's hometown for a few days. It wasn't made clear to me beforehand, but they actually stayed in Theo's mom's house. Theo posted on his Instagram story one night a short video containing his mom, my husband, and another man. My husband was drunk and possibly high and had his arm around Theo's mom. 

My daughter Millie follows him on Instagram and was upset about the video and showed me. This was obviously upsetting for me. On a basic level I was worried about something happening between my husband and this woman. But on another level I'm just worried about my husband.

I know during the time Theo was conceived, my husband was drinking, doing drugs, and living a very promiscuous life. He's turned his life around since. Although he's not sober, over the last couple decades he only drinks socially and rarely gets drunk. He's given up smoking and doesn't touch drugs.

Since Theo has come into his life this has changed. I see both Theo pushing him back down a path he's previously stated he doesn't want to go back to. He's been cagey about the whole subject.

When he came home I confronted him about his time away. I asked him about if something had happened between him and Theo's mom. He didn't deny it, just called me paranoid. We've talked about it some since but I won't go into it as this post is already long.

Last week, Maisie told me she and Theo were planning a vacation together. I told her I was uncomfortable with her having a relationship with him at this time. I explained to her my reasonings: mainly that I don't consider him a safe person. I also told my youngest two that for the time being they won't be seeing their brother. This isn't permanent. This is a decision I've mad to protect my kids from someone making reckless choices that is already impacting our family.

1bslwaz,AITA for saying I’d be disgusted if my husband went to a bachelor party? ,"So my husband is invited to a friend’s bachelor party next month and I’ve told him I’d be disgusted by him if he went, because he said that the best man has decided to invite strippers to the party (after discussing it with the groom). 

I’ve told him this for two reasons: first, I’m not thrilled at the idea of my husband watching other women strip naked and second, I feel like the whole way men view strippers is degrading and disgusting - you’re paying this stranger woman to dance for you and show you her naked body for your own weird pleasure, I don’t understand it at all and it’s disrespectful to your partner. 

He’s saying I’m overreacting - “it’s just guys’ stuff, we’ll all be probably laughing and she probably won’t even be that pretty” Ew. 

Lastly, in this part of the world (Eastern Europe) a huge percent of women who do this stuff are women who have been, in one way or another, forced into it (they come from low-income and low-education backgrounds) and someone is taking advantage of them and I don’t support that at all.

1b50c4a,AITA for naming my child after a villain?,"So, I recently gave birth to my husband and I's first child, a girl. When I was pregnant, we had a lot of trouble deciding on a name, but I finally found one I liked and my husband said he was fine with.

My husband was playing Street Fighter and I watched for a few seconds, and the character Juri was on screen, and something just clicked. I really loved the sound of the name, and brought it up to my husband. He was a bit unsure at first since the character is apparently a psychopath (I don't really know anything about the game or character) but I assured him it'd be fine since we aren't literally naming the baby in honor of the character, and that since it's also a real name it's not like it's inherently tied to that. He ended up agreeing to go along with it, and said it was a nice name regardless.

So, months later, the baby's born, and I'm talking with a friend of mine. She ends up asking how we picked the name Juri, and I brought up that it was kind of a funny story and explained how we picked it. She was kind of astonished, saying that I was naming my character after a villain who's a ""psychopath"" and that I was setting my daughter up to be bullied. I argued that it's a real name, and that it's not like I was naming the kid something like Darth Vader where anyone who hears it will immediately associate it with a villainous character. My husband chimed in saying he went to high school with someone named after Melina from Mortal Kombat (who is also apparently a crazy villain character) and everyone just thought it was cool when they found out. The friend just said that I was setting my daughter up for a lot of hardship in the future, and now I'm second-guessing my choice. I didn't think it'd be a big deal but a few other people among my friends/family found out the origin of the name and are now telling me it was horrible to name my child that.

1br32ip,AITA for not removing my ‘inappropriate’ bathroom mat for when my mother came over?,"I (24M) recently got married and one of the homewarming gifts i received from my dad (45M) is a bath mat that says ‘GET NAKED’ on it. It’s hilarious and it’s proudly displayed in the bathroom. My wife finds it hilarious too because she appreciates the close relationship i have with my father.

As you can tell, my dad had me pretty young and we have a very close relationship. He bought me the house i share with my wife Bia (24F) and he is the coolest parent ever. We get eachother silly gifts all the time and it’s the way our relationship works. 

He raised me by himself until he met my stepmother (i call her mom but for the purpose of the post I’ll call her stepmother) when I was six. He was technically with my biological mother until I was four but she was neglectful and abusive hence why he did all the child care himself. I’ve been trying to rekindle the relationship with her since I was 14 but it’s gone bust multiple times. We’ve been consistently in contact for the past three years and we are slowly making improvements although there is a long way to go. 

At my wedding, we had a mother son dance alongside the father daughter dance and I danced with my stepmother instead of my biological mother. No one was shocked by this besides my biological mother. 

She was really hurt by this so I’ve begun to put a bit more effort into our relationship. I’m not going to hold her actions from 20 odd years ago against her anymore when she’s being apologetic and has done the work to improve herself. My stepmother is fiercely protective over me and even she admits my bio mother is making a lot of progress. 

My bio mother is also very religious and conservative. She came over to my house for the first time and saw the mat. I knew it may have been an issue with her but thought that she wouldn’t comment on it. She tried to tell me it was sinful and that i should remove it and when i told her it was from my dad, she said it was childish of him to give me something like that. Her main thing against my dad is to call him childish because he’s younger than her by 3 years (i think, not even sure how old she is tbh) and apparently the mat was another iteration of his inability to grow up. FYI, he is a successful doctor with five more children that are being raised perfectly, I can’t even call them demon younger siblings because they are angels. 

I told her that I was going to remove the mat just because she was at my house, she said it was inconsiderate, we argued and she left. 

My wife thinks that she was over reacting although my friends said i should’ve removed it because most older people aren’t as chill as my parents (dad and step mom) so i should’ve anticipated her reaction. She is mad at me now and thinks that i don’t care about rekindling our relationship. AITA?

1b6okh1,AITA for calling my sister out for telling my wife that she looked pregnant?,"My sister isn't a child, she's 30. The thing is that she hasn't had the most conventional adulthood.  She spent most of her late teens and early twenties in and out of one rehab or another, she didn't go to college, lives alone and I don't think she has that much of a social live. She lives out of town so we don't see her much.

My wife isn't a heavy person by any means,  but like many, many people, she isn't quite as thin as she was when we first married, pre child and all that. Totally normal and obviously I couldn't care less. My sister came over with my mom to visit several months ago which was her first time seeing my wife and I in years. She came into town again more recently and we met her at my parents house. She saw my wife and said ""oh I thought you were pregnant"". Implying that my wife looked pregnant last she saw her but clearly isn't as she would be showing more now. My wife is a very emotionally mature person and didn't make a thing of it and neither did I. 

I thought maybe my sister, perhaps being less exposed to societal norms than some, didn't know that you don't say that,  ever. So I sent her a text later on telling her that I know she didn't have bad intentions but that it's generally quite rude to comment that someone looks pregnant and really shouldn't be said, basically ever. 

She got all bent out of shape, saying I was a jerk for ""guilting"" her and that I should ""grow up"" and ""stop taking everything so seriously"".

1bm5c92,AITA for refusing to wear an awful bridesmaid dress to my sister's wedding?,"My (Jane, 25/F) sister Lisa (27/F) is planning her wedding. She's detail-oriented, has a preference about everything, and wants it all to look perfect. Part of her plan is for all six of her bridesmaids to wear the same dress in the same color, and we knew that going in to shop with her at a boutique. Unfortunately, the other five are much smaller than I am, so picking out a dress that fit us all became an issue.

&nbsp;

We all tried on her favorite dress at the end, and it took me a long time to get it on. Outside I could hear her squealing with happiness as everyone else walked out of their rooms, and saying things like ""This is the one!"" with her friends hyping it up. But not only is it a horrible pale color that makes me look sick, it's unflattering to the point where I have massive rolls in the back and look pregnant in the front, especially with shape wear, which just bulges everything out across my hips and pinches the fabric up the sides. I also can't move well in it, and can't raise my arms more than halfway.

&nbsp;

I tried to talk to Lisa about finding a similar dress that could work better for my body type, but she and the other bridesmaids insisted that this was the perfect color and dress. Lisa was dead set on everyone matching exactly and seemed locked in on it, so we ended up (quietly) arguing in the store in front of our mom and the sales associate who came to check on us. They tried to calm things down by saying the dress looked fine and everyone matched nicely, but it was pretty clear they were just trying to keep the peace. When I asked the sales associate, ""Does this dress looks fine *on me?*""  her face turned red and she started talking about how it was important to honor Lisa's wishes on her special day, and at that point I hurried up to change and left. 

&nbsp;

Since then, Lisa and I haven't talked, while both my parents insist that I need to suck it up and do what Lisa wants for her wedding, while also relaying that she's been really upset about this issue, but I have been as well.

1br0k7o,AITA for forcing my partner to see a musical with me?,"My partner (27m) is not a fan of musicals. He doesn't ""hate"" them so much as is just isn't something he would choose to do. My family and I (26f) love musicals and they were a big part of my childhood growing up.

We moved to London not that long ago, and as a going away present my Mum bought us tickets for the Back to the Future musical. This is a really nice gift since they aren't cheap.

I assumed by boyfriend would be fine to go with me, but now he is refusing, saying that he would rather just stay home, and he doesn't even like musicals anyway. He argues that I could just take someone else.

The issue is that I have not been in London long, and don't really have many friends here yet. I'm also quite a shy person, so asking someone I don't know that well to see a show with me is a bit anxiety inducing. Plus, it was something my Mum got for us to go and see together as I had told her previously that it was one of my partner's favourite movies.

I'm really annoyed at my partner for this, because the tickets have already been paid for, and I was hoping that even if he wasn't a huge musical fan he could suck it up for me. My options now are to either go by myself, not go at all, or force him to go with me (which he has complained bitterly about).

1bavc2o,AITA for asking a hotel employee how they knew my name?,"
I’m staying in a hotel in Dublin City for the weekend and have a late flight home tomorrow evening. Around an hour ago I went to reception to enquiry if they could keep my luggage safe after check out and before my flight. There were two men at reception I spoke to. One was the young male receptionist who checked me in yesterday. The other was an older man, (50s) but he was not wearing the hotel uniform. 

The receptionist said “yes that’ll be no problem” and I smiled and said “that’s wonderful” then the older man said “what time’s your flight weary fruits?” I said the time and then realised, he knew my name which surprised me so I added “oh, that’s funny, how did you know my name? I didn’t tell you…” now I honestly believe my tone was more curious and confused since it had caught me off guard. I honestly thought maybe I was wearing something with my name on it and even looked down to see! 

The receptionist, said “oh, I don’t think he called you by your name, maybe he said Madame?”, I say “oh really? My mistake!”, honestly relieved if not a little embarrassed but the older man chimed in “no, she’s right, I know your name weary fruits. It’s my job to know everything and everyone here”. I reply with a nervous laugh “oh that’s bit weird…” I expected he was going to say JK or that he’s the manager and prides himself on knowing names etc. I clock that it all seemed a bit weird since he didn’t try to make it obvious he was joking. My real name isn’t even close to Madame so I don’t think I misheard him.  

The older man then asks what room am I in. I was caught up on how he knew my name but wouldn’t say how he knew it, so I started to feel a bit worried. Out of instinct I asked “why do you want to know that… I’m confused”. I believe I said this timidly but with a bit of anxiety as I remember scanning both their faces as I said it.

The receptionist interjects and smiles as if to reassure me, “i think he just wants to offer you a late check out”. I feel a better so say something along the lines of “oh I see that’s very nice of you but I guess I’m still just a bit weirded out by the name thing. Sorry I have had a long day so…” The older man says “well, I was going to, but since you’re been such a b word - I won’t do that now”.

 This  caught me off guard. Out of instinct, I said “I’m sorry I think this is gone the wrong way but it just confused me that we’ve never met and you know my name”. He then double down and repeats a similar line about how he just wanted to be nice but I had to go and be a b word about it. He’s not smiling or laughing just for context.

I can tell from the receptionists face he is shocked. I took a breath, said slowly, calmly, “okay well, I think that’s it. I really don’t know what to do with “that” (I gesture widely in his direction) language. I don’t appreciate it and I don’t have anything else to say so….” I go to leave, they both call me back but I just raise my hand and say “no, I’m done” and I left the hotel for air.

1bex2yp,AITA for not supporting my wife in changing careers?,"Me (M29) and my wife (F28) have have 2 kids (4+2) and have been married for 4 years. My wife works part-time as a receptionist, while I'm a full-time plumber. When our 2 year old was born, he was very sick and as a result we have some medical debt.

We are not currently struggling, but are living just at the point where we are comfortable.

My wife hates her job, but keeps in it because she's good at it and it pays well enough for an entry level position. She has wanted to become a nurse for a long time, but was unable to attend college and with the kids it's fallen on the backline.

I'm sympathetic towards this, I really am and would love to see her follow her dreams and become a nurse, I've made that very clear. But, she wants to do it now, and honestly I don't really see how that is possible. Between the clinical placements, studying, paying for the course, working, our childcare situation, our debts, I cannot see how it would work.

My wife says she has spoken with her parents and the kids would be able to stay with them usually and she could get a nightfill job. But I don't feel like this is going to be enough, she will be earning a lot less and I will have to work more hours to make sure we are definitely financially alright. This will mean I spend less time at home, can't contribute as much to household chores, which she will have to pick up and balance even more work.

I said I can't support this choice and that she should wait a few years until the kids are in school and she has more time. She says I am an asshole, that she has a right to be happy in her life and I should be supporting her. She says its unfair that I get to enjoy my work (which I do) and she spends her days hating it.

I agree it isn't fair but I just don't feel like now is the time to go about this and can't support her choice to change careers.

1bghnkw,AITA not asking permission to use hubby's coffee?,"My (28F) husband (37M) is a huge coffee geek. He has a separate set of shelves and equipment for it. I have tried over the years to learn more about his process and how to brew but it just doesn't click for me like it does for him. I always buy instant/go to Starbucks because it's all the same to me. He never says the coffee I've made is bad, just that something is always off. It's too bitter/astringent/weak etc. But thanks me anyway for my efforts.   
My husband is going through a busy time at work and has for the past 2 weeks. He freelances, his latest client turned out to be very difficult and he's had to make a lot of edits for this project. As a result, he's more stressed than usual and is working longer hours. So I thought that if I made him a coffee in the way he likes, that would cheer him up about it all.   
Long story short, he did not like what I brewed. He didn't really have anything nice to say about my gesture and then when he learned what beans I used, he was very annoyed and shut me out of his office without any thanks.   
He had two containers of beans on the shelf. I used the container which was small and finished it. I did not realise it was a rare coffee and processed in a unique way. It cost more than triple the other bag which was mainly full and double the size. I thought that using up the beans in the smaller container made more sense so he can buy himself another bag from his long list of beans he wants. He refuses to ever have more than 2 bags at once so he can appreciate them a lot more (whatever that means).  
He's upset with me because I didn't ask permission and he could have told me which bag to use if I was going to try and make him a coffee. I'm upset with him for his reaction. No thanks and shutting me out of his office. I think the whole permission thing is so gross to me and I shouldn't have to ask whether I can use something in our home.

1bez2tm,AITA for laughing at my sister because our mom won't let her share a room with her fiance?,"I posted here about a year ago because my mom and sisters thought I was an asshole because I went to Mexico with my boyfriend instead of appeasing her and making him sleep on the couch. 

My little sister thought I was wrong for not being able to spend nights away from him. Well we still are not married and my mom won't change her rules. We are visiting them though. And she accepts that we stay at a hotel. 

My sister Anna was one of the howler monkeys bugging me because ""I lied"" about not staying at a hotel last Christmas. She and her boyfriend got more serious since then and they got engaged on Valentine's Day. 

Last weekend was my dad's 60th birthday and we all came home. As per usual I rented a hotel. My mom told Anna that since my old room was available her fiance could stay there.

My sister tried arguing but my mom said there was no way that they were sharing a room. Anna tried to get me on her side since I no longer follow any dumb rules. I laughed at her and reminded her that she called me names for choosing to spend Christmas with my boyfriend's family instead of putting up with our mom. 

She started getting pissy and saying it was different because she was engaged and I am not. Our baby sister spoke up and said she already told Mom that she was going to follow my example if she ever gets serious with a guy. I'm pretty sure my mom thinks I'm the devil.

1blbacm,AITA for calling my mother homophobic for suggesting that my girlfriend ‘fixed me’?,"I (18M) was gay for as long as I can remember. I recently started dating my childhood best friend Lexi (17F). We have been friends since we were 10. 

I haven’t had feelings for a girl before so I’m not even sure what my sexuality is anymore. All I’m sure of is that I really like (possibly) love Lexi.

My parents have always been supportive of my sexuality but my mother has always seemed slightly disappointed. She never said anything about it outright, but you can from certain looks/comments that she made that she would’ve preferred it if i was straight. My father always told me not to pay it any attention because at the end of the day, she still loved me and needed time to adjust. He also said that she wanted life to be easy for me and that being gay made my life more complicated.

My mother loves Lexi and before I came out, she always made comments about it Lexi and I being together in the future. Even after I came out, she’d insist on me keeping my room door open when Lexi was over because ‘anything can happen if a boy and a girl are alone together, it’s natural!’. 

Anyway, Lexi was over at my house last weekend and my mother kept commenting on how we were ‘soulmates’ or about how we were such an adorable couple. After I got back from driving her home, my mother was grilling me about our relationship (how long I had liked her, how long we were dating etc). When I was finally released from the hot seat, she made a comment about how all I needed was the right girl. I asked her to elaborate and she said that my being gay was just phase and all I needed was for the right girl to come along.

I got pretty irritated after that and said she was being homophobic. We got into a massive argument. Now, my older sister thinks I was being an asshole because I know that my mother isn’t homophobic and that she’s from a different generation so things she’s saying are outdated, not homophobic. I feel bad now. AITA?

1bpgq11,AITA for not wanting to dump $15k on my sister's 50th birthday celebration? ,"AITA for not wanting to dump $15k on my sister's 50th birthday? 

So, I am doing fine in life financially but my sister is like on another level, way richer than me. She paid for her house x10 what I paid for mine, no exaggerating. She is very family oriented and enjoys family reunions, even when they end badly or hurting people's feelings. Both our parents passed away some years ago. So family reunions are the siblings getting together with their respective families. 

1.5 years ago she announced that she wanted to do something special for her birthday: she gave me notice, basically, that she wanted to have a family reunion at a posh European location for at least a week (she and her family are exploring Europe for 6 weeks prior to the actual party). I told her I was going to try to go. I did not have the courage to tell her that for me it would be difficult, just financially speaking. Bringing my whole family (I have many kids) on this trip was going to cost me no less than 15k. Just airfare alone would be close to 10k. 15k is one year of tuition (my oldest is a Junior) and I have other money stuff to think about too. So, when a thing from work created a conflict, I was relieved to have an excuse to cancel. 
She was super disappointed, particularly because she had made it very clear how important this trip was to her. If it had mattered to me, she said, I would have made the trip happen. So, I guess IATA. 
But, AITA for not wanting to shell out 1 year worth of tuition $ in a one-week ""special birthday celebration"" for my rich sister?

1blbtmp,AITA for being relieved when I found my friend was not adopting a child?,"Context: Randy (41M) and I (35M) have been friends since we took college courses together, same major and later finding out we lived in the same city but never met before. We've been through a lot as friends and have always had eachother's backs

After moving back to our hometown, we started a social group of about 15, then it grew and grew until we could fill an entire section of a bar and/or restaurant. Slowly but surely, people ended up not attending the outings as often when started having kids. Understandable. I loved our outings as I started drinking socially, never getting drunk. As far as I knew, Randy was also childfree and said when parenthood came ringing for them he'd say ""Another one bites the dust"" I'd reply ""Maybe we'll see them in five years""

Two months ago, I saw a post on Randy's facebook saying he was adopting a 1 and a half year old. It threw me for a loop because he'd never talked about wanting to be a Father or a burning desire. I was in a tailspin thinking ""Oh God, another one"" as my social circle has narrowed as they've had kids 

One month goes by and I see another post from Randy. He's a proud Dad

Of a dog. I was sooo relieved! I felt like I could howl at the moon because I wouldn't lose one of my favorite people to the parenthood Portal. 

Onto the conflict: At another one of our hangouts, Randy had shown his dog's picture to a bunch of oohs and ahhs and stories relating to their dogs' odd quirks. I said ""My heart lept when I realized he adopted a dog and not a kid, I was afraid I wasn't going to see him for at least five years"" We laughed, but Randy was a bit quiet. We finished our food and left. 

As we walked to our cars, Randy later told me I was a AH for being relieved he's a dog dad than a human dad and why was I so concerned about it? I told him that as I go on in life, it's hard to find non parents/childfree friends and I'm all for people doing what they want to do in life 

Randy asked why does that matter? I said I would've had to get used to a new reality with him as a Dad if he decided to have a kid and he knows exactly what that means. He's seen what happens with our parent friends we don't see unless it's at an event for their kid.  

Some of our mutuals are on my side saying I wasn't exactly wrong but I didn't have to say it like that. Others are on his side saying that I was wrong for saying I was relieved he was getting a dog rather than a child 

So AITA for being relieved my friend didn't adopt a child? ",Altruistic_Grass_428,1602,1,1.0,0.0754063254261273,1711145780,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1blbtmp/aita_for_being_relieved_when_i_found_my_friend/,2024,3,AmItheAsshole,2024-03-22 22:16:20

So, here's the deal. My (28M) girlfriend (27F) of two years and I planned a two-week vacation to Italy. I paid for the flights, hotels—everything, because I make more than she does, and I wanted it to be a stress-free trip for both of us. Everything was great until the last day when she tells me she wants to stay longer to ""find herself"" and think about our relationship without me. She didn't discuss this with me beforehand, and it completely blindsided me.  
  
I was hurt and told her that if she feels she needs time alone, then she should also be independent financially during this extension of her trip. I said I wouldn’t be paying for her new return ticket whenever she decides to come back. Now, she's upset, calling me unsupportive and selfish, and some of our friends are saying I'm being an a-hole because I left her stranded in a foreign country without financial help.

1cdza0l,"AITA for not letting my 6'6"" brother have the free first class upgrade the airline gave me on our 12 hour flight?","Hello AITA--

We are at the beginning of my dad's retirement family trip. He is paying for all of us to meet as a family in Hawaii for a week since he is retiring after working at the same company for 42 years. There are six of us but my brother and I live in the same part of the country. 

I guess it's relevant to say I am 5'1"" and my brother is 6'6"". I fly all the time for work and have quite a bit of status with the airline for which my dad bought our tickets. 

This is what happened way earlier today. We were all boarded and ready to go when a flight attendant came up to me and whispered that they had a first class passenger not show up and they needed the coach seat to accommodate a standby passenger. She said I had by far the most status of anyone on the plane so they were willing to move me to first class for free. I was like oh yeah--and I took it in a heartbeat. I told my brother I'd see him in 12 hours and let me know if he wanted any food or drink and I grabbed my stuff and moved. Needless to say I had a nice flight. 

When we landed and were waiting for our shuttle my brother was so pissy but wouldn't tell me what was going on. He didn't speak to me the whole shuttle ride. We had a nice hello with the rest of the family but after I got down from my shower my mom took me aside and said what I did ""was awful."" I asked her what she was talking about and she said that I should have given my brother the seat. I thought that would be the end of it but all 5 of my siblings and my parents are upset with me and the vacation is off to a very rough start. 

I was trying to play with my niece and nephew in the lobby waiting for lunch and my sister said ""no they only like to play with people who give a shit about their family--what were you thinking?"" I asked her if this was about the first class thing and she said ""what do you think its about?"" I said that he never asked me to switch with him, she said ""an asshole makes people beg, family members don't.""

1caofb9,"AITA for telling my overweight friend that I maintain my body through a healthy lifestyle, NOT genetics?","A few years back, 7 of my friends from high school and I decided that no matter where we lived or how busy we were, we were going to meet each other for brunch once a year for the rest of our lives. We don’t have an exact date, but we usually pick a week in June or July when it is warm, and fly/drive to our hometown for bottomless brunch at our favorite spot. Keep in mind that for some of us, this is the only time of the year that we see each other. I, in particular, live 2500 miles away, so I hardly see any of these girls. Regardless, it is always a good time, until recently when one of my friends “Rue” would not stop commenting on my food intake.

For some background, I am and always have been a very active person. I ran track and cross country for our college and I now compete in ultramarathons. For this reason, I eat a lot of calories, and I stay pretty thin. I also eat reasonably healthy, balanced meals most of the time. However, for the one day a year at our favorite restaurant, NOTHING is off limits. I eat plate after heaping plate of cheesy eggs, pancakes, hash browns, sausage, bacon–literally I could eat the entire menu.

Rue has always been on the heavier side. While I don’t really pay attention to someone’s weight changes or eating habits, Rue points it out, so I can’t help but notice. “Every year I eat nothing but oatmeal and I keep getting bigger and bigger, and \[OP\] is over there gorging herself and is stick thin!” “It’s like every calorie \[OP\] eats shows up on MY body!” Soon my friends started to chime in, saying that I was lucky I have such good genetics and can eat whatever I want. This really bothered me in part because it completely invalidated the work I do to maintain my healthy body, but also because I could tell Rue was frustrated with her weight, and I felt my friends were doing more harm than good.

I explained that I do not normally eat like this, and I also exercise very frequently, and that people shouldn’t look at a snapshot of someone’s life and think that’s how they live on the daily. I also said eating salads for every meal and never enjoying a meal out with friends is just going to make her more frustrated, which will slow her progress. I thought this was going to be helpful advice, but my friends all looked at me livid. One of them called me incredibly privileged and said I wasn’t aware of my privilege, and accused me of shaming Rue. The rest of them followed suit and told me to get off my high horse. Eventually I’d had enough. I said I was just trying to help and that they’re only going to hurt Rue (Rue was silent the whole time. I packed up my things, paid my bill, and left.

Now I’m feeling torn because it’s been a few days and none of these people will talk to me. I reached out to the person in the group I was closest with and she said I really overstepped and should apologize to the group and at least to Rue. I had good intentions, but if these people won’t talk to me, maybe I screwed up.

1btivvv,AITA for telling my friend her kid has no manners??,"A few of my (26F) friends came over to our house for a get-together lunch. A few of them have kids and brought them.

One of my friends, Nora (28F) has a 4 year old son (Jack) that is notorious for being naughty. Jack doesn't get along with other kids and is a constant source of crying and screaming. Nora brought Jack over. He said he wanted to take a nap so I showed Nora the guest room and told her to make herself comfortable. Nora came back downstairs after a while and we hung out.

Now, around 40 minutes later Jack came back down and was smiling like crazy. He had my wife's  (Kate - 29F) wedding ring. Kate is a doctor and doesn't take her ring to work. She leaves it on our nightstand. Jack had clearly gone into our bedroom. 

I told Nora I'd like him to give the ring back. Nora said he'd just get bored with it now and that I needed to relax. A few minutes later I asked Jack to please give the ring back. This triggered something because he ran to the window and threw the ring out in our spacious backyard. 

I got really, really mad. Kate adores her ring, and I had it custom made with many little touches. I told Nora her godd##n son had no manners and she needed to do something about him, maybe take him to a doctor because this is not healthy kid behavior. She got very upset and left. Other guests started leaving too.

Kate and I spent the entire evening looking for it but we couldn't find it. I am a crying mess, Kate keeps saying it's nothing but I know how much she loves that ring. Despite all this every mom in our friend group is calling me an AH for taking it too hard on Jack and Nora. Was I an AH?

1c3c7mw,AITA My husband tells me to stop asking for help and just do it myself,"Today my husband, my 15 month old son and I went to a friends place for her birthday celebration. While eating i was holding my son and asking for a napkin because he was making me and himself wet and dirty. And as my hands where full and my son was sitting on my lap i asked my husband as nice as i can for a napking. For this he had to get up and walk 5 meters…but he decided that i dont need one and made a joke to use my pants to smear the mess on….And i asked again. Nope he did not get one still….

Anyways..in the car later i told him i did not understand why he cant help me and he said again that he thought it is no needed to get a napkin… but if i ask that means i need one. He disagrees. He got mad at me for telling him this and said i should not nagg because afterall he spent sll day with me and for me with my friends.

also: he told me next time i should just give him the baby and go get them myself

AITA for asking for help???

update: this morning he acted very kind to me: asked how i slept, if he should cook for me and he cleaned alot. This tells me i was right to be upset and he knows that he was not good to me. but he has not talked to me about it yet or apologized.

Also thank you for all the powerfull comments and different opinions! I dont think he deserves all the harsh comments and also divorce is not necesarry. But he has to improve!

update 2: so far all he talked to me was about helping me or if i need something. and one thing was especially surprising today: he packed an emtpy luggage with winter clothes to make more room in the closet! first i thought he is leaving. but then he asked:“ i am putting my winter clothes away! thats s good idea no??“ with s cute voice. but no apology or explanation yet. And as long as i dont get this i wont interact more than necessary.

  
update 3: we talked snd he was sorry for all the points i needed to hear to be sure we think the same way and have similar values. He told me he had a little bit too much to drink and wanted to be funny but he knows also he should not do it like this. Also he explained me that when i mentioned the napkin he got mad because he helped me alot this day and all i do is finish the day with complaining about one thing instead of seeing all the good things he did. In the future he will tell me for example:“ i will help you more next time and take it seriously when you need me but i am also sad that all you think of was this one mistake i made when the rest of the day i put so much effort in.“

1c2m1ew,AITA for wanting an ASL interpreter at my brother’s wedding because my boyfriend is deaf?,"I (42 F) will be officiating my brother’s (37) wedding next month. Several months ago asked my brother and his fiance (35 F) if I could make arrangements and pay for for an ASL interpreter to be present for the ceremony since my boyfriend (43 M) is deaf and I cannot support his communication while officiating the wedding. After some discussion, my brother said that I could as long as the interpreter would not be in any photos. I made the arrangements and informed my boyfriend that I had secured an interpreter. Yesterday I received an email with the wedding day itinerary from the wedding day coordinator and it did not mention the interpreter’s arrival time. As a courtesy, I asked my brother’s fiance if the coordinator needed to know the interpreter’s arrival time. In summary, her response was that they decided that I cannot have the interpreter at the wedding because they are not hiring an interpreter for her non-English speaking family members, and they would be providing paper copies of the ceremony script for the non-English speaking guests in their native languages, and I could print it out for my boyfriend if I wanted. I expressed that my boyfriend needs the  accommodation of an interpreter, which I would be providing and paying for, in order to participate like everyone else, and that having a disability and being a non-English speaker are not comparable. She also said that she did not know I hired an interpreter because she thought the idea was discussed but a decision hadn’t been made. When I questioned my brother he said that there was a miscommunication, admitted that he did say I could hire an interpreter, but is now agreeing with his fiance. I have tried explaining why this is not acceptable and that my boyfriend needs an interpreter for the ceremony. I even gave the example that this would be like telling a guest with mobility problems that he or she can’t use his or her own wheelchair at the wedding, and argued that it is their choice to not provide an interpreter for their non-English speaking guests since they do not think it is fair to have an interpreter present for my boyfriend, but not their non-English speaking guests. They could provide interpreters for everyone who needs one if they wanted and I am sure that if her family wanted to provide an interpreter for their guests, it would not be an issue because we had already discussed having her brother translate for me while I am officiating, but he did not want to.

1cgd5fj,AITA for not getting upset or convince the bride after I was uninvited to my friend’s wedding?,"This happened over the weekend but there’s still so much tension. 

One of my good friends, Matthew (26M) is getting married next month to Jennifer (26F). I (25F) have known Matthew since high school. We’ve both connected when it came to video games, especially Minecraft. Matthew has had his fair share of girlfriends over the years but when he met Jennifer 3 years ago, he said that he knew she was the one and they are madly in love with each other and I am so happy for them both. 

Last year, Matthew popped the question to Jennifer and she said yes. Jennifer’s demeanor towards me drastically changed after the engagement. She was distant towards me, she wouldn’t look at me and she would hardly speak to me which was weird since Jennifer was always so sweet and nice towards me. 

I’d still talk to Matthew and meet with him and our group of friends, sometimes with Jennifer and she would still act cold and not speak to me much. I kept my distance from Jennifer. Three months ago, we all received a save the date invitation and their wedding is going to take place at Matthew’s cabin 2 hours away and they were going to keep it small due to the size of the cabin so we were only allowed to bring one guest. That was when Jennifer acted extremely harsh and hostile towards me and said “bet you don’t have a plus one since you are so into my man.” I was taken aback. I asked her what the fuck she was talking about and she smirked and said I knew and to not act stupid. I ignored her remark and told her my boyfriend was coming. She looked surprised and left. I of course told Matthew about what Jennifer said to me and he was not happy, so he made her apologize to me. 

Then, last weekend, I was invited by matthew’s sister to go dress shopping with her and Jennifer. I declined at first because I wanted to keep my distance from Jennifer but Matthew’s sister assured me that she will deal with Jennifer and that our other friends will be there with us. So we go dress shopping and I found a beautiful dress that I thought would be perfect and I took a picture to send to my boyfriend since he planned on matching (I.e with a bow tie) with me. I tried the dress on and it was a perfect fit so I guess I got lucky. Jennifer was angry, called me names such as a whore, a boyfriend stealing bitch, and that I was officially uninvited to the wedding. She caused such a commotion, the employee of the store asked us to leave. 

I told Jennifer I didn’t want to come to the wedding anyway but I was going to because MY FRIEND was getting married. I told her if she didn’t want me at the wedding, fine. I don’t give a fuck since I won’t go to a wedding if the bride is going to be so rude to a guest. 

Matthew and our friends found out and I was getting texts left and right begging me to just come to the wedding. I told them I was happy to get uninvited and I’ll just spend the day with my boyfriend on the day of the wedding instead. They’re all mad at me for not fighting hard enough. 

AITA?

Edit: so my decision is final. I will not be going to the wedding and there’s no changing my mind about it. I will be sending a wedding gift to Matthew the day prior to the wedding instead. I told Matthew and all my friends that I won’t be going and they can’t convince me otherwise. Matthew also called me and asked if we can talk somewhere. I agreed but it’s to tell him in person that I won’t go so that way he knows I’m serious about that. 

Update: I met up with Matthew and brought my boyfriend along. Of course, he begged me to come to the wedding and he said he would beg Jennifer to let me attend. I told him it’s best if I wasn’t there. I told Matthew that Jennifer has a problem with me. Period. He said he doesn’t understand and he did ask her many times but Jennifer would continue to say she was just “stressed”. I got angry and said that’s bullshit and he knows that. My boyfriend also intervened and said to Matthew that he needs to wake up and realize Jennifer is crazy and he can’t keep defending her. Matthew said he loves her too much and doesn’t want to lose her. My boyfriend and I got up and told Matthew to let us know when he has a backbone. In the meantime, it’s best we don’t talk. I messaged all of our friends in the group to let them know I’m keeping a distance from Matthew because of Jennifer. He’s still my friend but at an arms length. I will still be sending him a gift regardless but I’m keeping my distance from Matthew. It seems like he is in denial and can’t comprehend what’s going on at all. He usually is in denial, ever since high school he would have a sense of denial. 

Another thing to mention is that Jennifer is nice to all of Matthew’s female friends. Just not with me. I’ve also gotten a message from two of our friends saying they have dropped out of attending the wedding because of Jennifer and that they are on my side. 

Edit 2: Jennifer already bought her wedding dress a while ago. When I went dress shopping with Matthew’s sister, she invited Jennifer as a way to resolve this animosity she had towards me. So it was Matthew’s sister who wanted to buy a dress and I found a dress that I loved and Jennifer went crazy. Hope that clears things up since so many were confused.

1cd47ej,AITA? Choosing Daughter over Husband?,"My husband (m,64) and I (f,65) have been married for 20 years.  He has two sons, Jason and Craig both married (m,41 and 39).  I have two daughters Jenna and Kiera both married (f, 38 and 37).   All of our kids are independent and living on their own.  His boys have families but don’t live anywhere near us.  My girls recently received an inheritance from their grandfather of close to 1 million each.  They are being responsible with it.  One is saving a big portion of it for retirement and her son’s education.  The other doesn’t have kids and doesn’t live near us.  So this is about the one who lives close to us and has a pre-school son, Kyle. 

My husband has gotten very upset lately about the help I am giving Jenna with babysitting Kyle before pre-school and in the afternoons 2-3 days a week.  He is a good eater and likes things that are driving up our food bill maybe 40-50.00 a month.  Husband resents me not getting paid for the food and to a lesser degree  my time.  He says it isn’t fair to his grandkids that they are not being treated fairly.  I suggested he send the grandkids’ parents money for treats each month.  He wants me to charge Jenna and then not have to give his grandkids anything.  I don’t want to charge Jenna anything.  I don’t think that grandparents should charge for childcare or food. 

He gets aggravated if he sees a new colouring book or markers here. He seethes with rage at times if I invite Jenna’s family for a meal.   He thinks Jenna and to a lesser degree Kiera should be helping us instead of hoarding their money.   He also gets very agitated about me not telling him if Kyle is going to be here.  He says that he doesn’t feel like it is his home and that I make all the decisions.  He is threatening to break up our marriage over the disparity and unfairness of the situation.  

Some info on our finances: Money isn’t plentiful but we both have pretty good pensions. After our bills are paid we have between 2 and 3 thousand a month to spend on groceries, gas and other miscellaneous expenses. We have very minimal savings.   He travels to see his grandkids maybe 2-3 times a year.  One he flies to see and the other he takes the train or drives.  Averages out maybe 500.00 a trip.  I don’t travel at all.

He thinks I am  the AH because I am willing to risk our marriage over this.  If we divorce we will have to sell our house and neither one of us will be able to afford to live to the standard we have now.

1c9uviz,"AITA for repossessing my daughters car, after she took $20K for a wedding that never happened","My 26 yo daughter (Helen) & I always had a good relationship up until a few years ago. She started dating Marco in her final year of college. That same year, her mother & I separated. It was amicable, & we agreed on divorce terms without any disputes. 

After her graduation in 2021, she & Marco became engaged. I was very happy for her, however encouraged her to think about a long engagement, given they are both only now entering the workforce. She did say her ideal wedding location was booked out for 3 years, and they intended to save up for it. I told her that I would contribute $20K to her wedding. I also purchased her a car for her graduation, however kept the registration in my name.

Helen started to become distant, but whenever I asked if everything was ok, she said yes, & denied there was any issue. I just hoped everything would return to normal.

In April & of the blue, Helen posted on FB to announce that she & Marco had eloped & married at the registers office, with her mother, & MIL/FIL as witnesses. She said that they were planning on using their savings as a house deposit, & would have a small gathering at their home in lieu of a reception. I was so shocked & hurt that I found out in this way. I would have completely supported this decision had she spoken to me.

I called her to ask why I was not invited, & she said it wasn't personal, they just wanted to elope. I finally told her that I have been hurt the last few years with her being more distant, & I missed how close we were. Again, she didn't say much but was very cold & distant. I told her that the $20K I had given her was to be used for the wedding, & this is when she lost her temper, saying that if I was ready to part with that money for the wedding, why should she return it now? She would use the $20K as part of the house deposit, thought that's what i would have wanted, & hung up on me.

She ignored my calls/texts for the next week, apart from her finally responding to my last message with 'f\*\*\* off'. Here is where I may have been the AH. After I received that msg, I arranged for her vehicle to be towed back to my house. I sent her a text saying she had effectively been phasing me out of her life, clearly doesn't respect me, & I don't like that she feels entitled to take the money I had gifted her under false pretences.

Since then, both she/her mother have been blowing up my phone calling me every name under the sun, & she has told me she wants nothing more to do with me. I feel that had she told me she wanted to elope & save for a house instead, I would have offered her financial help, however her entitlement to think she is owed the money irrespective how she treats me is what i have an issue with. Where I feel i may have been an AH is that I think that taking back the car might have just been a petty thing to do to my daughter. I really don't want to give the car back to her after what she has said to me, but i just need to know if i overreacted or not - ready to accept my judgement.",agonisedfath,4504,1026,0.9700000286102296,0.353755282032889,1713738958,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1c9uviz/aita_for_repossessing_my_daughters_car_after_she/,2024,4,AmItheAsshole,2024-04-21 22:35:58

1c1ui93,WIBTA for telling my in-laws that we can't afford a fancy restaurant and that we are not contributing to paying for the meal?,"My father-in-law's birthday is coming up and my partner received a message from his sister saying that she and MIL have booked a restaurant for FILs birthday. We were not asked about our opinions or price range or included in the discussion. Quickly looking at the restaurant information, I can see that they have a set menu and single price of about $120AUD per person, and that is excluding drinks. Drinks are an additional $30 per person for a package or $15-20+ for a single small glass of wine (minimum some are apparently$60-90 per glass- not that I would order that)!

We told my partner's sister that this is well out of our price range at the moment due to having a single income and a lot of unexpected bills. She said she didn't care and to ""work something out"" as they have booked this restaurant and it is for their father's birthday. 

We have tried to tell MIL (we are not allowed to mention where we are going to FIL) that it is too expensive and we have just been brushed off and told that we are going and too bad.

Every person involved knows of our financial situation and went ahead and booked an expensive restaurant without speaking to us first-- we were just told.

My partner is angry at his sister and thinks she is inconsiderate. She thinks that we are being unreasonable in our concerns about how expensive this meal will be (we pay less for our electricity!).",quietquesti0ns,4914,913,0.9700000286102296,0.347693515671007,1712879790,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1c1ui93/wibta_for_telling_my_inlaws_that_we_cant_afford_a/,2024,4,AmItheAsshole,2024-04-11 23:56:30
1c9vmp5,AITA For not calling 911 when someone overdosed at the store I was working and I was the only one with a phone?,"Important context - We actually don't have a store phone where I work, we just use our cell phones. I was the only one with a cell phone today because my co-worker left hers in her car.  
  
So anyways I was at work today with my co-worker (it was just the two of us). My co-worker goes to use the restroom and comes back screaming to me ""Call 911! Call 911! Someone's overdosed in the bathroom!!"". I say to my co-worker ""Okay, hang on a second"". I walk over to my purse and grab the Narcan that I keep in there and go to the bathroom. I see the woman who is on the floor in the stall. I go into the stall and do a quick sternum rub (no response) then I administer the Narcan. Thankfully she responded very well to the Narcan and woke up, however, she was \*pissed\* (\*which I understand). She storms out of the bathroom and out of the store. Meanwhile, my co-worker is still screaming at me ""CALL 911! why are you letting her walk away ??? she needs medical attention"". I explained that 911 would have just done the same exact thing I did, only we would have had to wait on them. Also there's nothing else left to do, she already left the building.  
  
So now my co-worker is pissed off at me for not calling 911. I think she wants to report me to our manager for not calling 911 when there was a medical emergency.

My (17F) mom wants me to wear my sisters prom dress for my prom. I told her that I didn't want to do that because my sisters dress is not my style and it wouldn't match with my boyfriends outfit. My mom told me that she didn't have enough money to pay for my dress and that my sister's dress was the only option.

1bxo3yx,AITA for defending my son for using a different language when he was upset during an argument at kindergarten?,"I (36F) have been married to my wonderful wife (Anna - 35F) for the past 10 years. We have a 5 year old son, Liam.

Anna and I both work during the day so Liam spends the time until one of us can pick him up at his kindergarten. The other day, Liam's teacher called me and said they would appreciate if we both were available when we picked him up, because he had gotten in an argument and they wanted to talk to us.

Initially I was worried so I moved a few of my meetings and called my wife. We both went to pick him up. The whole issue was he had gotten in an argument with a girl over the rules of a game they were playing. The teacher said as he got angry, he started speaking in a different language, and no one could understand what he was on about. The other kid's parents said it was offensive to speak in a way that no one understood and we should have taught him better.

Now, I am a Greek woman, my wife is French. We live in an English-speaking country. While Liam can certainly speak English, he occasionally uses Greek and French. Both Anna and I learned each other's languages so our household is a mix of all three at different times. He picked up on both of them and can speak them more or less.

I said we have clearly taught him well since he has been able to speak in other languages fluently this whole time but only slipped when he was frustrated during an argument. I said it was in no way offensive, that it was human reaction, and that Liam would surely get it under his full control over time but he is FIVE now so maybe we all should take a deep breath.

The other kid's parents were extremely mad saying their daughter was so upset she cried after the argument and that Liam had to apologise about making her feel this frustration via using another language. My wife answered them with the same overall point as I did but they didn't back down. Even the teacher said we had to work on Liam not making this a recurring theme which is fair.

After the meeting was over and we were going to drive away, the other kid's dad made a comment along the lines of 'you're all arrogant rich people driving cars like this and thinking whatever you're doing is right.' In front of the kids. I got really mad and said I hope you're a better parent than what I'm guessing you are. 

After we went home, Anna and I did tell Liam to not speak to othet peoole in a language they don't understand. Later we talked among ourselves and wondered if we really did escalate the whole argument even more. I am asking on behalf of both us. Were we TA?

1bwuexr,WIBTA if I don’t let my husbands female friend stay with us for a few days while she’s grieving,"Husband (32m) and I(27f) have been together 3 years and to preface this post, he has never given me reason to doubt him. He works remotely while I work in person M-F and don’t get home until 6:30-7ish pm most days. Earlier today, he texted me saying he spoke to an old friend (33f apparently) of his because she moved to a city 3 hours from us and after hearing about the things that happened in her life recently, invited her to come stay with us for a few days. 

He told me that both her parents and her brother passed away within a few months of each other recently (around a year ago) and she only has a sister left as part of her family now who she’s away from atm. She also recently broke up with her BF who she had been dating for a few years, not sure who broke up with whom. He said she seemed very distraught during their phone call and he didn’t really know what to say or how to console her, that he felt really bad for her, especially because she’s mostly alone now. She said she was off from Thursday to Sunday next week so he invited her to come and stay with us for that time.

This woman used to be his coworker at the first job he worked, probably more than 8 years ago now. I know and have met most of his friends but this is the first time I’m hearing of her, but it might be understandable because I haven’t met people he knew from 8 years ago unless they live close by. What I think really pissed me off was that he didn’t ask me if it would be okay, more or less just gave me a heads up that he invited her. I’m normally all for helping a friend out in a time of need but i expected him to ask me and make sure I’m okay with it before inviting someone over like that. I’m not comfortable with a female friend of his being in the house alone with him for a few days while I’m not around for most of the day. I don’t know this person or what they’re thinking so while I trust my husband, I don’t trust her. Grief and loss also makes you act in ways you might not normally act in and the fact that she had a recent breakup isn’t comforting either so I feel like letting this happen would be like inviting trouble into my marriage. I also know for a fact that if something inappropriate happened, even if she initiated it and my husband shut it down, I would lose trust in him for bringing this situation about despite me not being okay with it.

 He got to take me for the weekend and on the car ride over there ( I was with my stepmother) my little sister said she and my dad had a daddy-daughter day the same day I had my performance. I was so angry to hear he canceled on me for my younger sister.

I talked with him later when I saw him and he asked why I was getting so worked up over nothing, I told him of course I was angry he looked dumbfounded and told me I was being bratty that he missed one day of my life( he missed many days just saying) and said I was angry over nothing.

1c0xk8z,AITA for telling my wife to quit her job because she could do it with our sons instead?,"For context me (M29) and my wife(F28) have been married for the past 4 yrs and have been blessed with two sons. Recently my wife has been complaining about the difficulty of her job more and the amount of work she has to put in following a workday. I work about 50-60 hrs a week whereas she works 40hrs a week and I have tried to increase the amount of home work I do over the weekends lately.

The problem for me lies in the fact that we take both kids to daycare which costs a pretty big chunk of our budget and is more or less 70-80% of her income per month. I make enough for all of us to be more or less in the same financial situation with a few more overtime hours a week if she quit her job. 

And since she has been complaining recently when she started venting yesterday I told her she might as well quit and just take care of the boys, and id bump up a few hrs since it's pretty much the same type of work (she works in social care). According to her I'm minimising her work and just not focusing on the real problem.

1ccambx,AITA for yelling at my mom because she ate the food that I bought with my money?,"
Our fridge is usually close to empty. There’s always condiments, eggs and some sort of shredded cheese but that’s it. Usually cream for coffee too which I sometimes use for cereal. The pantry is full of dried pasta, Cheerios and granola bars that are strictly for my sister. My dad locks away all of the good food for himself and wears the key around his neck like fucking Zoey101.  So there’s nothing to really make besides scrambled eggs, cereal or pasta. Yeah I should be grateful that there’s food at all but I’m sorry I can’t just live off of those things. Plus I have a really sensitive stomach so a lot of dairy and gluten will destroy my stomach.

 Yesterday, I bought my own food and left it in the fridge. Starved myself all day for as long as possible so I could eat towards the end of the day to not go to bed hungry. I got a big enough meal to eat half last night and half tonight. I don’t make enough money to buy solid meals for myself all the time so I was really looking forward to not eating the same old thing yet again. I opened the fridge today when I was hungry to the point of vomiting and the majority of my food was gone. Maybe a bite or two left but nothing I could actually get full off of. So naturally I got pissed because I’m starving, I paid for it with the little money I have in the first place and my mom didn’t even ask. So I walked into her (home) office and asked her if she ate my food. Her argument was that she thought it was old from days ago when she literally knows I came home with it last night. I even got her something too which she ate for dinner last night!!!!Then I got even more mad saying I’m starving and haven’t eaten anything in over 24 hours. She started bawling her eyes out and my dad started screaming at me for being over dramatic. Then she dramatically left the house saying she’s gonna blow off work for the rest of the day to go and get me the same meal. My dad ran out and took the keys from her before she could leave then came inside saying she’s crying. 

So not only did she eat my food, she guilt tripped me and made me feel like I’m the reason why she’s not gonna make any money today. Because she ate my food that I starved myself for. I think I feel extra guilty because we get along well but this isn’t the first time it’s happened. When I told my sister she sighed and rolled her eyes because this has happened to her too with the same excuse. All I know is that I’m mad, feel guilty and have extremely low blood sugar so I might just sleep it off or something. Am I the asshole for reacting the way I did?

I rushed back to my pc after shower and heard 1 of the guys complaining it has been more than 10 minutes and I was late. Alright my bad, so I took 15 minutes instead of promised 10, so I voiced out ""Hey sorry I am back give me a moment ya""


That guy then said ""Finally, it took her forever can we start now?"" So I said ""Wait I am still naked at least let me change before we start""


The guy then started saying ""you don't have to say that"" ""we don't need to know that"" ""too much info"" ""my wife is listening"" and expressioned his discomfort. I rolled brushed him off saying ""relax it's not like I am inviting you or something""

1ccbdnc,AITA for not explaining to my sister why she was stupid for asking me to share my art supplies.,"I babysit for my sister all the time. She pays me the same as anyone else. But she is a lot more entitled than anyone else. 

My nephews are really good kids but spoiled. They eat when they are supposed to and a don't need to wrangle them much to get them to bed. However they are fascinated with my art supplies. I am not an artist. I just like to draw. I have a few apps on my iPad but I like my paper and pencils as well. I also have oil pastel crayons. 

My nephews wanted to draw with them but I said no. They complained to my sister and she told me to let them draw with me. 

The next time I came by I brought pencil crayons for them. Not good enough. They complained and she said I was being mean not sharing. 

Time before last I just didn't bring anything except a book to read. She gave me shit for being immature. 

Fine I gave up. I bought them them some cheap oil crayons. I gave them to her as I was leaving. 

She called me today. She gave them the crayons but did not supervise them. She has spent the last two days trying to get the oil paint off her couch and carpet. She says my brother-in-law is pissed that I gave them art supplies that are so messy. I forwarded her the messages where she called me childish and mean for not sharing. I offered to send them to her husband so he could know whose idea it was. 

She is mad and demanding that I watch them for free to pay her back for the cleaning. I just said I would not watch the kids any more. She tried to trick me by not having cash when I showed up. I said I was leaving since I didn't trust that she would pay me. Strangely she actually had the cash. 

She did call our mom and tell on me for giving the kids oil paints without warning her. 

My mom wants me to keep the peace and offered to pay me to watch the kids and let my sister think she won. I'm thinking about it.

1cgeffp,AITA For not considering the baby part of the family,"AITA For refusing to give up the baby items?

Ex and I were married for 20 years.  We had 2 kids together.  Our son was the 6th grand child 💙 born on his side, and our daughter was the 7th grand child and first Grand daughter 🩷 on that side. There were 5 more kids born after her.
On my side, our kids were the first grandchildren.

I have always been into vintage/ handmade items.  MIL would make blankets / sweaters / booties / mittens for all the babies.  When our daughter was born she also made rompers and dresses for her.  The other 'daughters' never appreciates what she did. In addition to what SHE made, she also gave us the sweaters that were given to her son (my husband) by his Nannies (grandmothers).  My mother, (first grandchildren) would shop at $$$ boutiques for out fits for my kids 🙄 She finally came to reality and started shopping cheaper.

My kids also wore the Christening gown that MY grandmother had worn. (Yeah, it was old).

In addition to the clothing, there were toys.  Toys from their grandparents when they were babies.  Toys from  their father's side that none of his siblings wanted for their babies.   Toys from my side I wanted them to have. Toys they got as gifts. And yes, I had all the toys tested for safety before I allowed the kids to have them.


The kids grew up and out these things.  I packed these items up in boxes so that when our children have children of their own, these things will be available for them if they want them.


Our marriage didn't last.  He walked our on us, and left all boxes (baby items) with me.  He quickly remarried. 


His wife has a daughter that was out of the house when they married. The daughter, recently had a baby.  Now, his wife had seen photos of our children wearing some of the items I had saved up, and SHE feels that since HER daughter had 'the first grandchild' 🙄 that SHE (her daughter) is entitled to all the baby items I had saved for future grandchildren.

AITA ... He walked away and left all the baby items with me. I saved the items so that OUR children will have them (if they desire) for THEIR children (OUR grandchildren).  They (him & wife) feel that since his wife's daughter gave birth, she is just as entitled to the saved baby items as our children are.

And yes, I could ask ex-MIL what she would like me to do with the items, but I really don't want to get her involved if I don't have to.

I MIGHT be TA for not allowing my ex to give baby items from OUR kids that I saved for their future children to his wife so she could present them to her own (already existing) grand babies.

1c93w9u,AITA For keeping my kids away from their new uncle?,"
I have been with my wife “L” for 11 years now. We have two kids together, a 2 year old girl and a 6 month old son. My SIL, M, was beyond excited when she found out we were expecting, and wanted to be very involved in our kids lives as the “cool aunt” because she herself believed she would never have children.

Last year, M asked our group of friends, “If you were talking to someone, and they threw up several red flags in their personality, but they treated you nicely, would you continue to pursue that relationship?” We all, of course, said no. Red flags exist for a reason. But then, a week later, she introduces my family to her new boyfriend “R” and his daughter “S”. Before doing so, M made a note to tell me that R was conservative, which i thought was odd. We are all very progressive, and “M” more so than the rest of us, so i thought it was a bit weird but that’s ok. R was quiet throughout the dinner and after that, we didn’t see him for a while, though M continued to be very involved in our lives. 

A few months later, we went on a family vacation and “R” tagged along. On the very first morning, i was sitting in the floor playing with our daughter while a children’s show with a black man as the main character played on the tv. He walked over to M and whispered something to her and she got up and turned off the tv. When i asked why, she said that R didn’t want S (a 7 year old) watching it. Ok, whatever, it was background noise anyway. Then, when she went back to him, i heard him say “-that fucking queer” to her, referring to the main character. I was APPALLED. M is bi so i was astounded that he would say that to her and even more so that she laughed after he did. We parted ways for the day but that night, we all met back up for dinner. I wasn’t feeling well so i left early, but later that night my wife told me that he made several racist comments about the black family seated next to us with my daughter right there at the table. At that point i’d had it. I did not want this person around my kids. 

When the trip was over, i told M that i thought she was making a huge mistake with this guy, that he wasn’t “conservative”, he was homophobic and racist and i don’t want my kids growing up thinking it was ok to hate people because they’re different. She got very upset with me because this meant he wouldn’t be allowed at family holidays if my children were there, and that if i just spent a little more time with him, i would see he wasn’t all that bad. I refused. This caused a massive argument between L and M and now, M said that if R wasn’t allowed around my kids, she wouldn’t be a part of our lives any longer. To make matters worse, she’s now pregnant after believing herself infertile, and her and R are getting married next weekend. Now my wife wants us to go to couples counseling because she’s convinced that i’m overreacting about this. If she wants us to go to counseling, that’s fine with me, but i don’t think that i’ve done anything wrong.

1c9w8wm,WIBTA If I Didn't Let My Widowed SIL and Her Kid Live With Us?,"My (38m) SIL (idk, late 20s/early 30s F) husband died a couple weeks ago. SIL was a SAHM and didn't have much left besides some inheritances that were left to her that still need to be settled. My wifed has told me that she probably will have to sell the house due to a) They have no emergency fund and b) SIL dropped out to become a SAHM and has no income source of her own. 

As sympathetic as I feel, moving her and another kid into our house, on top of our own two under 10 kids is a HUGE lifestyle change I'm not sure we'll be able to take on. SIL's kid is 4. We *do* though have a vacant home (3bd/3ba) that we usually rent, but our last tenant moved out, so it's just been existing for the past few months. I offered that they live there (about 45 minutes away from us) but my wife is persistent on them moving into OUR house since my sister needs a support system. 

I'm open to help out, but I feel the case of moving in needs some more consideration, besides les do it.

1cge2qt,AITA For Refusing To monitor My Kids' Eating Habits? ,"I (42f) have two kids (14f and 13m) and a niece (15f) who all live with me along with my mom (70f). As all three kids are in the midst of puberty, they have been packing down food like crazy. But it doesn't matter to me, I just buy and make more food since I really enjoy cooking. The food in question isn't like brownies and cake and mostly unhealthy stuff, but stuff that we normally eat. They always come back for seconds and thirds and stuff. 

  
Yesterday, I made chicken wings, Suya, and rice (weird combo I know). I made about 25 chicken wings, 15 suya sticks, and a lot of rice. After everyone had eaten, there was basically nothing left over, and I guess my mom picked up on the fact, since during cleanup, she told me she felt like these kids were eating ""too much"" and I should stay consistent on certain food portions, and after that no more. I don't know about you guys, but I felt that was a terrible idea since I feel like every teenagers eats like crazy. 

  
My mom could see I was firm on my stance, but today after school (they love to eat after school) my mom didn't let them get anything from the fridge. At least until I asked her to please open it for them. 

  
AITA? I can see both points on how impulse control for food can be handled but i dont think its the way to go about. So im asking here for judgement.

1cdx6jv,AITA for refusing to return a gift I was given 7 years ago?,"For context, I was dating a girl in college who went to Thailand and got me a handmade machete as a gift. I have kept it through the years, but it's mostly just been in my garage and I use it for random things like cutting boxes up to fit in the trash can. 

Long story short, we broke up over 7 years ago and she blocked me on every form of social media and other forms of communication. Last night, her friend (who I'm not friends with on Facebook) messaged me on Facebook saying that my ex-girlfriend wanted the machete back. I was pretty taken aback by the request and asked why she didn't reach out to me directly and pointed out how strange it was to make that request, especially after not talking to me for nearly a decade. She acted like I was an asshole for insinuating that the request was tacky and strange. The majority of my friends think the request is ridiculous and I should tell her to kick sand, but some friends are saying if I hardly use it, why not just give it back? I don't really care that much about having the machete, but the principle**(ETA) of it just really rubs me the wrong way.

1c05j41,AITA for laughing at a friend that said my mother took advantage of my dad after their divorce? ,"I (19f) am an international student. I was with a friend recently, and we landed on the topic of parents. Our parents divorced when we were really young, so this kinda became a venting session for both of us lol. 

In my case, my parents divorced when I was 6 and they had shared 50/50 custody of me.

Then we got on the topic of child support, and this was where things got weird. I’m Muslim, and I was born and raised in a Muslim country with Sharia law. And under sharia law, it is the fathers that bear the sole financial (key word: financial) responsibility of having children. 

So when my parents divorced, although both my parents have good jobs, and were earning similar amounts at the time of the divorce, my father had to pay my mother child support for the time she would have me. 

And my friend thought this was incredibly weird. She asked me why my mother agreed to accept the child support if she didn’t need the money.

The simple answer: my parents are religious. My mother believes  that it is my father’s responsibility to financially provide for me, not hers. My father believes the same.  

My friend kind of laughs and says it’s easy to be religious in a situation like that when you can get money you don’t need off your ex. I laughed at her. It was funny.

She gets pretty offended that I laughed at her and she asked me why. I told her she doesn’t know anything about my parents but she automatically assumes the worst of my mother. Honestly, laughing at her was kinder than anything I would’ve said to her at that moment. 

She pretty much stops talking to me at that point and now I’m wondering whether I should reach out to make amends.

1cfk918,AITA for kicking my baby’s father out of the hospital room?,"I (19F) just had a baby 1 day ago. His father (21M) and I have not been together since November due to him cheating. He’s had a couple other girlfriends since then and is still with one of them currently, but he still did go to most of my appointments with me. 

2 days ago when I went into labor I called him, he came to pick me up to bring me to the hospital and he had his entire TV and playstation in the backseat, with no car seat for the baby. I told him he is not bringing that to the hospital and he told me if I want him to be there for our son’s birth he needs something to do to pass the time. We argued about it almost the entire ride to the hospital, but he ended up not bringing it in. 

I was only in labor for about 2 hours before I gave birth, he was there the entire time. A couple hours after I gave birth, my dad and sister came to visit and he left as the hospital has a 2 visitor only rule. I told him while they’re here visiting for him to go bring his TV back home and install the car seat so when they discharge us we will be all set. After a few hours my family leaves, and I text him to tell him he is welcome to come back if he would like. 

Around 20 minutes later he’s walking back into my room, carrying his TV. We start arguing about how I already told him he is not having that in my room and he starts yelling at me saying that I don’t make the rules and that I should be grateful that he wants to be there for our son but instead I’m trying to make him miserable. I told him he can either bring the TV back to his car or he can leave, he said he has a right to spend time with his son. 

I called my nurse into the room and told her I want him to leave, so they ended up kicking him out. He yelled at me the entire time he was leaving saying that I’m kicking him out of his son’s life and that he will be going to court for custody. He has texted me since saying that I’m taking his rights away from him and there is no rules that he couldn’t bring his own TV and game system while he spends time at the hospital.

1c2m00c,AITA for refusing to lend my daughter out to my SIL for a “mommy and me tea”?,"I never really had a good relationship with my SIL Sheila. She has two boys with her husband, my hubby’s older brother. Both of her sons are special needs.
I think Sheila has always resented me for having only girls. She is very feminine, likes to her hair and nails done, go out for girls nights and she doesn’t show much interest in her sons’ activities. She’s always talked about how nice it would be to take her hypothetical daughter shopping or brunch instead of being home alone while Brandon takes the boys out to basketball games or fishing. She adores my younger daughter because she’s at that age where she still loves ballerinas, princesses and anything pink and girly. 

Over Easter, Sheila asked if my younger daughter wanted to come to a “mommy and me tea” for Mother’s Day. I said no, because my hubby and I are already planning something for Mothers Day. And I want to spend it with my girls.

Sheila broke down and mumbled something about how she wanted to do something fun instead of being stuck at home with her sons.

I felt bad for her. Sheila loves going out to eat but can’t take Cooper or Teddy along because they can’t cope with being still or in loud places with lots of people around. She and her husband haven’t gone out since Teddy was born and it’s hard to find a sitter. 

At the same time, my daughter isn’t a doll to placate her “girl mom” wants.

I feel worse now because we had a family dinner last night and Sheila broke down crying when someone asked what she had planned for Mother’s Day and that she just wanted to do “normal mom things” for once.

This whole thing makes me feel nauseous. When I talked about it to work colleagues over lunch, they suggested that I let Sheila take my Kate to lunch anyway. It will make her feel better, they said, and I’d be the asshole if I didn’t do something to help her.

1bubgh7,UPDATE - Brother of the bride’s girlfriend lost it on me and got dropped from the wedding party as a result,"So, I saw a lot of people saying they wanted an update and people were really kind offering advice so thought I would provide some closure on this saga. 

I decided that it would be best to speak to Jane and confirm how she wanted to play it. I told her as much as I don’t want to deal with Kathy I’m not seriously going to stick to the ultimatum. Jane said she is definitely not having Kathy as a bridesmaid, and that she’s sorry it even came to me having to say that. We agreed that Jane would handle any questions about Kathy and say that it wasn’t about my ultimatum. 

On Jane and the bridesmaid thing, a lot of people were saying her aesthetic choice didn’t make sense, and you were partially correct. She admitted she mostly just didn’t want Elliot and Kathy to be photographed together. i told her she’s a complete moron (affectionately) for not telling me because we could have prepared this better. 

Elliot and I also met up to talk. 

He explained that Kathy has a bad relationship with her family, that’s why she was really hoping to bond with his. He also said she has a lot of insecurities and that she projected a lot of these issues onto me. As for why, he shed some light on this, too. Elliot’s best friend (my family by marriage) shared some things with her and kind of over-egged some stories and it set Kathy on this path of thinking I was Regina George, basically. Elliot has tried to correct her but she won’t hear it.

As for her thinking I’m trying to “steal” him, some of you were right. She does think that my hanging out with his family means I must not dislike him as much as I say. She thinks because I have a history of dating people close to him (two people years apart) that I must secretly like him. Elliot agrees this is crazy but Kathy just won’t let go of this idea. 

As for us walking together, I said I would support him asking Jane if he could walk with another bridesmaid but that if she insists, I’m going to be on her side and Elliot agreed that was fair. 

He said he’s been trying to be understanding of her issues but he sees now it was wrong to force the bridesmaid issue and he’s going to focus on helping Kathy in a way that doesn’t involve everyone else from now on. I left it there in regards to Kathy because it’s not my place to comment. 

Our conversation actually turned out to be pretty productive, elliot and I aired out a lot of things from when we were kids that I guess were overdue a conversation. We’ll never be best friends but we are getting a joint Father’s Day gift for his dad so that’s something. 

I’m still going to be as civil to Kathy because honestly she clearly has a lot bigger issues than whatever issues she has with me and adding to it just seems pointless. 

That’s that. All’s well that ends…decently, all things considered. We will definitely be watching her for any drama at the wedding but for now that’s it.

1buc68g,AITA for laughing when my MIL and SIL got chewed out by my fiance?,"This is completely stupid and if nothing else might give y'all a good laugh too. 

I (27m) am getting married to my fiancee (26f) later this year. She's an incredible woman and I'm the luckiest man alive to have her in my life. Unfortunately, she comes attached to a very entitled and self absorbed family. I genuinely don't know how my fiancee ended up as amazing as she is with these people around. The main players in this conflict are my MIL (53f) and SIL (24f) to be. When my fiance and I announced our engagement last year SIL had a complete breakdown, throwing a full on tantrum that she deserved to get married first and my fiancee should be forced to wait. I was so confused by this reaction, but my fiancee just looked bored, which confused me even more. Apparently her sister does this a lot when she feels she deserves something more than my fiance. MIL took SIL’s side saying that dating wasn't as easy for her. My fiancee always tells them off for being annoying and ridiculous and they hate it, which is kind of funny to me. So here's where I need some help.

Three weeks ago I got into a nasty car crash and my left leg is broken in multiple places. The doctors say I'll likely have a permanent limp even after I heal because of how bad the injury is and might even need a cane. My fiancee is an absolute angel and has been by my side every step of the way. I'm going to need a couple different surgeries and some serious physical therapy before I can properly walk again, and she's been pushing my wheelchair since I got home. MIL and SIL stopped by yesterday and that's where the trouble is. SIL asked my fiancee when she would be leaving me. Flat out, while I was in the room. MIL also chimed in saying a wheelchair or cane would look horrible in wedding pictures so it would be best for her to cancel and leave. I was horrified. I didn't even get to open my mouth before my fiancee went absolutely ballistic at her mom and sister. She told them that they were delusional if they believed she was that shallow. She kicked them out almost immediately saying she was done and over their BS. They both looked like they sucked on extra sour lemons. I couldn't help laughing at their expressions. This was apparently what did it for them and they both huffed off still insisting they were just looking out for my fiancee. I laughed for a solid couple minutes before calming down. My fiancee just looked so exhausted so we had some cheer up snuggles.

I've been getting messages from SIL all day saying that me laughing at them wanting my fiancee to not have to spend the rest of her life looking after me was completely uncalled for and I'm an AH. She makes it sound like I'm completely paralyzed and I'll need 24/7 care until I die. I don't think I did anything wrong but what do you guys think? Should I have kept my laughter to myself? AITA?

Update: Hey y'all. This thing got a lot more attention than I thought it would considering how dumb the whole situation is. But I'm actually glad it did, because I've been reading the comments with my fiancee and we're both seeing how fucked up her mom and sister's behavior actually is. She said she hadn't even thought about going no contact since she was just so used to their BS, but now we're really talking about pulling the trigger. MIL and SIL have also officially been uninvited from the wedding, which they did not take well, especially MIL. SIL is blocked on my phone now, but her and MIL still message my fiancee. It's a little hard for her to block them completely just yet, but we'll keep working on it. 

And for those of you who've asked where the FIL was during all this, I don't actually know. He divorced MIL a long time ago and doesn't have contact with her or his daughters anymore. My fiancee says she doesn't care or miss him because he was just as bad as MIL and SIL. 

Lastly for those asking, yes I absolutely did spoil my fiancee later after they left. I already mentioned snuggles, but we also got her favorite take out and binged this new show she's been wanting to check out. It was actually really good. We can't do much bedroom wise right now, but I promise if I could I would have. I'm not sure if I'll update again. Maybe if something significant happens.

1bthqat,WIBTA If I Made My Husband Pay Me Each Time He Forgets Something?,"I (30f) am married to my husband (31m). As much as I love him, he is extremely forgetful. The most of that forgetfulness being with little stuff, like forgetting his water bottle at home, or forgetting to close draws/cabinets (oh this shit gets to me indeed). And I don't really think it's carelessness but he genuinely just looks around and doesn't remember to do it. A couple days ago he started writing notes on the doors to make sure he closes them, but he still forgets to close some cabinets or drawers sometimes. And mark my words, once our kid (2m) is old enough to start kindergarten, he's gonna forget to pick him up. 

&#x200B;

Well, on Friday, when he left for work, he left at least 2 drawers open, the microwave door open, and forgot his drink, as well as his food. I was actually surprised by the food thing, since he never forgets that. I did drive to his job to give him his drink (insert mental image of 6 month pregnant woman trying to fit into q7). When I got there, he retrieved his stuff and I made him give me 50 bucks though for my time and for gas. Shit is not cheap. 

&#x200B;

When he got home, he asked me if the whole pay thing was gonna be a regular thing, and I told him he could always just remember his stuff. He just laughed and walked away, but I don't think he's actually taking me seriously, and I'm asking here to see if i would be wrong if I did.

1canplo,AITA for suggesting someone’s connection to a school helped her get in?,"
I got to a small public school. Most people who go to college go to state schools. 

There’s a girl in my class, Sam, who’s pretty smart. Her family is not from here, and one of her parents attended an Ivy League school where she has two relatives who are professors, and her other parent also attended a very prestigious school. 

Today was our college decision day, and Sam was wearing a shirt for the school her parent attended. A teacher in one of our classes asked her about it, saying “it’s not too often that someone from here goes to [that school]”. 

Sam is smart, but she also had an advantage to get in. I responded with “it’s not too often someone here is so connected with [that school]” as a lighthearted joke. Sam got annoyed and told me that I was being rude. Her friend told me I was downplaying her achievements because I was jealous(which I wasn’t). 

Our teacher had to tell people to move on. I didn’t mean it in a rude way, just that it was easier for Sam to be accepted than the average person.

1byh2ul,AITA for siding with my stepson over my wife about her being too overprotective?,"Quick backstory to this. I (42M) am married to a 54F (we’ll call her Janet) and she has a 35M son from her first marriage (we’ll call him Paul). Naturally, Janet had her son young and got married young. I’m closer in age to Paul than I am my wife, but I try to be a better father to him than his father who is way out of the picture at this point. Paul and I get along well, but he butts heads with my wife a lot. One of the biggest reasons is because she’s so overprotective of him, even though he is a grown man, has a career and lives by himself.

Paul is planning a 3 week trip to New Zealand this summer to visit some friends he has that live there as well as do some solo traveling around. He has traveled by himself before and Janet has always made him leave a copy of his itinerary. Janet again is asking him for a full itinerary complete with his friends’ addresses and phone numbers, hotels he will be staying at in other cities, etc. 

Paul told her that’s ridiculous that she needs all of that and that he’s a grown man, if she needs to reach him, she has his phone number. This turned into a huge argument where they both looked at me for my take. I was honest and told Janet that I think she’s being over the top and that he is a grown man. Later, this turned into an argument between Janet and I where she said I undermined her as a parent in front of her son and I should present a united front and not try to act like Paul’s big brother all the time instead of step father, etc.

So, AITA? Janet asked for my honest take and I gave it to her. Now she’s mad at me. Is it not unreasonable to give a grown 35 year old man his personal space when he travels without infantilizing him?

1c0xxd7,AITA for telling my wife that her SIL could not use our brand new SUV as her cousin's party ride,"Wife: 39, Me: 40, BIL: 32, BIL-Wife:32

Last week my wife told me that our brand new SUV was requested to be used as a ride and I thought it was for one of our kids school. Turns out it was her SIL (BIL wife), her SIL cousin is having a 'quinceanera' and they want to use our SUV as the ride for her.

I know her parents but not the uncle and aunt like friends or something like that, just seen them a few times at some reunions. Of course my response was not the best but I kind of laughed and said no way because it was unbelievable for me.

A little backstory: I grew up poor and I did not have much growing up, but I have worked so hard to earn and have what we own. And don't get me wrong, my wife is the sweetest woman I have ever met, she's kind and caring and always looking to help others when possible. She did not offer the SUV.

So now my wife is upset with me because I said no and the way I said it. I did not brought up the topic anymore and BIL and BIL-Wife went to my In-Laws and asked for their SUV instead. BIL-Wife argument was that renting a nice SUV was too expensive and they were 'ugly'.

Now I feel like our family doesn't like me or sees me as ""not nice, you could've help but didn't"". Oh well... AITA here?

1bw10xk,AITA for telling my daughter she knows nothing?,"I (41F) have a daughter who is 17, and her father and I divorced when she was 7. We had a very rocky marriage, during which I was a stay-at-home mom, and I struggled a lot financially afterwards. Because of this, during our divorce, my ex-husband and I agreed that our daughter would live mainly with him and I received alimony payments from him for about 4 years after our divorce.

For the first several years after the divorce, my daughter would stay with me every other weekend and several holidays (the specific holidays depending on the year), and I always enjoyed our time together, but it would often feel like she didn’t want to see me. She was never interested in any activities or occasions that I planned for us and normally when I called to talk to her, she would be busy with school, an extracurricular activity, or something else.

Usually when she would spend the night with me, she’d ask about the divorce and why her father and I aren't together anymore. I always tried to be as honest as possible with her but I could tell the divorce had been hard for her and when she started high school she stopped visiting altogether.

She and I have been low contact for the past few years, and this past weekend we had an argument regarding her graduation. She’s graduating from high school this June, and I texted her to ask about the details. She responded with a very passive aggressive text asking if I would actually come and how she didn’t want to waste a ticket.

I wasn’t sure where it was coming from, so I called her and she started ranting about how I was never around, and that I always blamed her father for everything, and how I cared about my students more than her (I’m a high school teacher). I interrupted her and told her that she knows nothing about what happened between her father and I.

I told her that she made her choice to stop visiting and not to answer when I call her and that she couldn’t blame anyone else for that and she hung up. About an hour later she sent me a long text about how much I hurt her and that she didn’t want me at her graduation and that I “needed to change”.

Since that night, I’ve gotten several messages from my ex-husband’s family about how I’m a terrible mother and how I should’ve been more involved when my daughter was younger, and I’m not sure how to handle this.

1buby6i,AITA for expecting my bf to be on board with my goals? ,"My bf(26M) and I(25F) have been together for 5 years. We dated in college and both moved to a new study to work. We have been living together for 4 years. We both have student loans he has about 58k and I had about 30k but I paid it all off.

I really got into paying off debt and the FIRE subreddit helped. I began saving everything I could. My family is working class and my parents did waste a lot on alcohol and smokes but it was hard for them to save when they couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I really want to do better for myself and I resolved to not drink. My parents do have issues with alcohol and I drank more than I should during the pandemic and it scared me that I might be losing control. I have been sober for nearly 2 years and it feels like a big accomplishment. I went from a 50k job to a 90k one and I’m saving near 60% of my income now. 

My bf still drinks and smokes weed and isn’t interested in my saving goals at all. When we first moved in together we would be short rent a lot and had to ask the landlord for an extension a lot. Now I’m have to front the money for his share of rent and it’s annoying because he makes enough to cover rent and doesn’t save enough to cover it before he buys weed or alcohol. I think he spends at least $400 a month on that stuff and he uses doordash every day pretty much. I’m not a good cook but I’ve been trying to get him to cook with me so he can not eat out as much and he just says it’s not for him. 

We’ve also been looking to move to another apartment but the one we recently tried to go for rejected us because my bf has things in collections according to them when they ran the credit check. He denies it but given that he is late on rent so much I think he must have. 

I’m now trying to talk to him about these things and he gets annoyed and mad when I do saying trying to retire early or save up money that could vanish anytime doesn’t make sense. We had a fight during the weekend where he told me my goals are not his goals and I have no business trying to tell him how he needs to change. I guess I don’t but I’m not sure how to deal with this anymore. AITA for wanting him to change and be onboard with my goals?

1bxq7o4,AITA for sending my parents a picture of the Biblical Rebeccah every time they try to get in touch with me?,"I'm a 19 year old woman currently in college. I come from a churchy family, and there was a big fight two years ago when I decided to get a septum piercing and a nose ring. My parents thought it was trashy and whore-ish, and that only awful people get piercings like that and display them for everyone.   


I'm not really religious, but I've read a lot of the Bible, and in one of the fights I pointed out that the Biblical Matriarch Rebeccah, the wife of Isaac, wore a nose ring. (Strictly speaking, it's not 100% textually clear that she did; but when Eliezer gives her one and some bracelets in Genesis 24:22, and a few verses later  her brother notices her with the jewelry, and the bracelets are explicitly being worn, I think the reading is much more natural that she just put the jewelry on) And if they're really all about me being godly and following the teachings of the Bible, there shouldn't be any problems with me having a nose ring.  


That did not persuade them, and things have been a bit chilly since then, although the distance when I went off to university has helped some. Still, my folks have reached out on several occasions, once every other month or so, and most of the time, I'll respond, but usually send back pictures of some sort of image of Rebeccah in an icon or something. I have not come home in person since I went off to study.  


This morning, my uncle called up. I've gotten along better with him than most of my family, and he asked when I was going to stop being 'childish'. And that while I have every right to keep my distance from my family, I should either say I don't want to have much contact and stick to it, or push for a reconciliation. And that sending passive-aggressive and catty pictures like this was just stirring up trouble for no actual benefit, and that I should stop. I have a lot of respect for my uncle's opinions, and maybe I shouldn't keep this going.

1d578oc,"AITA for ""tricking"" my brother into selling me his half of our childhood home then demolishing it? ","My mom and dad divorced when I was young. My brother loved the fact that our mom had no rules for him so he went with her. I abided by the custody agreement because I had no choice in the matter. My mom loves us both but she dotes on my brother like he farts perfume. 

My dad kept the house. He had to buy my mom out. It was an old house built in 1953. It had old wiring and was really less than suitable for modern life. What it did have though was a huge yard that was great growing up. 

My dad passed away during COVID. He left everything equally between my brother and I. I wanted the house. I told my brother that we should tear it down and put in infill housing like that neighborhood is zoned for. He just wanted money. I bought out his half of the house at the market value. It was sold as a teardown. He took the money and bought a car and went on a vacation. He still has money left. 

Then I had the house demolished and built a fourplex. Each unit has three bedrooms, 2 and a half bathrooms, a small yard, and a garage. I kept one unit for myself  and rent each of the other units for $2,000 a month. My mortgage is $1,800 a month for the entire thing. So basically I live free and bank $4,000 a month. 

My brother is pissed that I didn't give him a unit to live in for him since it was his home too. I actually offered to sell him one at cost and he said no. 

I'm lost. I offered him a partnership, I paid a fair price, I offered to sell him a unit, I did everything to try and be fair. He thinks I tricked him because I get ""free"" money every month. 

Our mom said she would be cutting me out of her will and giving everything to him if I didn't give him a unit or the income from one. I agreed that was fair and said that I would no longer feel the need to contribute to her upkeep or retirement when the time came.

1cit51q,AITA for not going to another restaurant after my boyfriend refused to order from where I stopped?,"Earlier today I asked my boyfriend to go with me to run some errands. When we finished I was hungry and picked a Mexican restaurant for lunch. It was more of an authentic place which I absolutely loved but my boyfriend said nothing looked appealing. He gave me money for my meal and said he was going to go to a place down the street. 10 minutes later he's back because the place had a really long wait
time.

I made some suggestions from the menu he would probably like to try but he said no. He said he told me last week he was burned out on Mexican food when we went out for dinner with my parents because 'we always eat it'. He didn't order anything that night either which was really embarrassing to have someone at the table not eating the entire time and trying to explain to my mother and step-dad in a way that didn't sound disrespectful. 

Service at this place was rather slow so I wound up taking most of my meal with me. He said to stop along the way to my place so he can get something to eat. I said no because he knew I had to be home by a certain time for a maintenance person and everything he wanted was in the opposite direction.

We got back to my place and he said he was going to go home because he was starving. I said he could stay and cook something here but he said no and that he needed space after I 'made him starve'. I told him he wouldn't be starving if he hadn't been picky and he left. He's still mad at me so AITA here?

ETA: No I am not Mexican but my stepdad is so I grew up eating it most my life. My stepdad picks where we choose to eat each week or he won't go, and they want all of us there each week or its a whole drama. I do cook other kinds of food sometimes. I do eat different food when I go to his home. When my boyfriend eats with me including our weekly meal with my parents it's only 3-4 days eating some kind of Mexican cuisine. I'll start asking him where he'd like to go when I drive.

The place he walked to was like 5 minutes away but he thought he wouldn't have time to wait for take-out since take-out was a 35 minute wait. Usually the sit down places I go to are pretty quick, like get your food 10-15 minutes after ordering. When we realized the place I chose was slow he didn't have time to go back or place an order online.

Our new babysitter is only 16, but she had been babysitting one of my coworkers children for awhile and I trust him.

I need to buy a new car, and I would love to have a manual transmission. It’s my one non-negotiable. I grew up driving manual, and I miss it deeply. All of my cars have been inherited, so I’ve never had a say in my car’s features/specs. This will be the first car I’ve purchased for myself. Finally, I’m a “car guy.” I enjoy driving, and I’ve always wanted a sporty car, but also have it fit my needs.

My wife is 7 months pregnant and bought herself a new mid-size SUV last year (with her own money). She views cars as a way of getting from A to B, with practically and comfort.

Note: we have to park our cars back-to-front in our gravel driveway, with one car being in the garage. I will widen the driveway, which I can do it in a weekend, so we can park our cars side-by-side.

We have mostly separate finances, but have a joint CC and checking account, which we both contribute to monthly. The rest is our personal money that we keep in personal bank accounts (including separate savings and separate investments).

I’m paying the down payment and monthly payments on the new car. So I feel the decision is mine, but happy to listen to my wife’s thoughts (reciprocation from her car purchase). 

When I started the car buying process, I went with sport compacts (which are in my budget). Based on our prior discussions, the car has to be a daily commuter for me, allow me to take the kid(s) to/from Daycare, and quick local trips.

My wife thinks these cars are too small and cannot fit our needs with a baby and a potential second child. She says there’s not enough space for kids stuff (there is) and the backseats won’t fit two backward-facing car seats (they will). I’ve tried to show her my research, but she refused to watch the videos or read the articles I’ve bookmarked. 

Her main sticking point is she won’t be able to drive it because it’s a manual. She’s concerned she won’t be able to drive it when she’ll need to (in an emergency). I told her I’m happy to teach her manual, but at first she flat out refused to learn. Now she says she’ll learn, but gives an excuse of how we’ll be too busy. I said if it’s that important she drive the car, her mom can stay for a weekend to watch the baby and we can take a day for her to learn. Again, she said we won’t have time. 

Every time we discuss it, she accuses me of ignoring our family and that she needs to be able to drive the car. I say she’s creating a false dichotomy, and the car I want can fit our needs. I also argue that her car can be the big family car for trips or hauling, and my car can be for easy parking during city trips or sports events. Note: I don’t drink, so I will always be able to drive.

We’ve had many arguments over this. The most recent resulted in her giving me the cold shoulder for 2 days. I am at my wits end and ready to buy without her blessing. 

WIBTA if I ignored my wife’s objections and got the car I wanted?

Edit: I’m specifically looking at is a Honda Civic Si. We live walking distance to urgent care, CVS, and a grocery store. Our neighbor is a NICU nurse if shit really hits the fan. And we do “baby sit” my FIL’s SUV (he works/lives abroad), which we use on occasion, but we don’t know when he’ll be returning. So a third car is not an option for now

Edit 2: Classic RIP my inbox.
After parsing through this thread, there are separate issues at play that I’ve sorted out and here’s what I’ve gathered.

1. IWBTA for BUYING a car my wife can’t drive WITHOUT her blessing - yes, I fully acknowledge my timing of this is awful. I will postpone the purchase until after the baby arrives and I’ll get an automatic to ensure we both drive the car.

2. I’m not an asshole for WANTING a manual car and the model of car I want is reasonable. My wife could learn eventually, but that’s her choice. Again, my timing is terrible (which makes me the A-hole) so I’m going to get my “fun car” in a few years time. 

Clarifying point: I don’t want an SUV. They’re more expensive and I much prefer driving a car that’s not high up. I also think automotive companies have shoved a narrative down American’s throats that SUVs are the ONLY family friend options which is false. Literally just look at the rest of the world.

1cnie84,AITA for evicting my brother and his family from the house I have inherited so my daughter can live there?,"I(40f) have a daughter ""Caroline"" (17f), my brother ""Adam"" (34m) is married and has 2 kids under the age of 5.

Back when I was in my twenties our great grandmother ended up with an illness which required someone to take care of her. This ended up being me as everyone else was busy with their lives and I have only recently graduated from uni back then. Due to this when she passed away I have inherited the house she lived in, which is a small 2 bedroom. I have lived there until I got married and me and my husband ended up moving to a bigger property. About a year later my brother asked if I'm willing to rent it out to him, which I agreed to do, but have warned him I will need it back when Caroline turns 18 (She was 3 at the time) since it is very close to universities and city center. Legal agreement was drafted for the rent (significantly below market value) so everything was followed by the book.

About a year ago I have informed my brother about needing the house back as my daughter is going to be 18 and I would like to have some repairs done before she moves in. My brother ignored me, so I have issued him notice to vacate, which was also ignored. As he continued to ignore me, I had no choice but apply for a court order to evict them, with hearing taking place last month. Last week him and his family were officially evicted. Upon getting into the house I have noticed it wad in horrible condition and it would take a few months just to make it somewhat habitable, let alone do redecorating or repairs.

I have raised this with my brother since he was meant to look after the house and let me know of any repairs, but this talk ended up in an argument where I was called an asshole for evicting him and his family so my ""spoiled"" daughter can live by herself and not giving them enough notice (they had just over a year to find something suitable). He also said I have inherited the house by ""cheating"". My parents are on his side since Adam and his family live with them.",AccomplishedMango209,11560,908,0.959999978542328,0.5017469534715643,1715209920,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cnie84/aita_for_evicting_my_brother_and_his_family_from/,2024,5,AmItheAsshole,2024-05-08 23:12:00
1d2wc7d,AITA for repeatedly calling someone stupid after they accused me of lying about my children’s ethnicity?,"My husband is Dominican and I’m Irish. Our kids look like him in terms of facial features but they inherited my pale skin. Our son has his father’s dark hair but my daughter’s is borderline dark blonde. Genes are weird, what are you gonna do?

Both my kids and myself have my husband’s last name, which is a popular Dominican last name. There have been times we get looks when people hear our last name and my husband isn’t around. But it’s never been too bad and usually, I shrug it off.

Due to my husband’s work schedule, he’s rarely at school events. So, most people just know me. There’s another little girl in my daughter’s class with the same last name as us. Her mom also volunteers often. When we met, she flat out said “you’re not Dominican.” I said, “no. My husband and kids are.” She said “but your last name is (x)”. I said yeah…because it’s my husband’s. She pointed out how pale they are. I just said genes are weird.

But almost every time we see each other, she brings it up somehow. Making comments about how pale the kids are. Finding it weird they don’t know Spanish (my husband didn’t learn growing up so they don’t know it either). I just let it roll off because while it’s weird, I’m not about to get into a pissing contest.

The teacher asked the kids to make collages about their cultures. My daughter’s had stuff related to being a Dominican and stuff related to being Irish. They had a whole culture day where parents were invited. The mom of the other little girl saw my daughter’s collage and rolled her eyes, thankfully not in front of my daughter. There were no other kids around at the time as they were getting food. It was just parents looking at the collages. I asked what her problem is. She said I’m not a real Dominican. I said I never claimed to be. She said my kids aren’t either and that my husband is probably only a little Dominican and we’re claiming a culture that’s not ours.

I was dumbfounded. All I could ask was “are you stupid?” She said there was no need to be defensive. Finally, I had enough, pulled out my phone and showed her pictures of myself with my husband and the kids. She stared at it for a moment and mumbled an apology. I said “yeah, maybe research how genes work so you don’t make yourself look stupid in front of a bunch of 3rd graders”. She got teary eyed and walked away.

I got the stink eye from some other parents which I ignored. When I told my husband later, he said calling her stupid repeatedly, when she already apologized, was an asshole move.

1clw8w7,AITA for not wanting to attend my brother’s wedding because and for calling my SIL rules stupid? ,"Im 27F dentist and my brother 32M and his soon wife 27F are getting married in less than 2 months. Let’s call my SIL Abby. Abby and I never had a relationship of our own. We definitely don’t hate each other but we are not besties. We just exist in each others presence.
I noticed that in the invitation to their weeding that Abby requested the dress code to be all women in the wedding to wear off the shoulder dresses, suits or anything just off the shoulder. Doesn’t matter the color or the sequence unless it is off the shoulder.

Now as I said I am a dentist and as many people already know dentists may not have the best back/shoulder posture ever. And Im not an exception and I always tend to wear outfits that do not emphasize that part of my body.  Now the type of clothing this dress code demands needs someone with a good back posture because that’s the emphasis. I totally lack that and yes I did try one dress of the shoulder on looked absolutely horrendous.

So I asked if I the dress code is really that important and if I have to abide it but my brother told me Abby stressed on this dress code so much. And Abby was like if she “leeways” me she has to leeway everyone (I was kinda baffled that so much importance was placed on a certain type of clothing with no explanation given) 

I went with my friend shopping hoping I’d find one that I looked not so clownery in. I tried on so many different fits, looked like shit in all of them. So I told my mother since they are so attached to that dress code then I think the best option here for me is to not go. So I wouldn’t ruin their organization and I wouldn’t have nightmares about how awful I looked in that event. But my mum got mad at me and said Im being dramatic for not wanting to be there for brother and family just for a dress. I told her I want to attend but I also want to look good and feel pretty and they are sticking to such a stupid rule that they can’t provide a meaning. Regardless I respected that and decided not to ruin their image of how they want their wedding. My mum said my absence will also ruin things because the guests will wonder why the sister is not attending when Im healthy. I told her well the guests will also wonder why I look like I could be the guy of hunchback Notre Dam (okay Im not that bad but you get the gist here) My mum is still mad at me (haven’t told my brother and SIL yet)",Useful_Flower2687,2607,2034,0.8899999856948853,0.4532852681051693,1715034868,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1clw8w7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_my_brothers/,2024,5,AmItheAsshole,2024-05-06 22:34:28
1cnhi4x,AITA for not getting my daughter anything for her birthday?,"My daughter turned 13 yesterday. I made sure to ask her what she wants for her birthday a few months in advance. She gave me a list. Great. I explained she won't be getting everything from the list as it was big and some things were expensive. She understood.

About a week after we had that conversation, she tells me she wants tickets to a show for her birthday. Going to the show would also mean traveling a little out of the city. Neither are cheap. So I told her that would be the only gift she would get and would also replace a party. She said that's what she wants and I triple checked before I booked tickets.

A couple of weeks ago, would you believe, she tells me she changed her mind again. She wants clothes instead of the show. I told her I already booked everything so there's absolutely no way. She got into a strop about it and said she isn't going. I told her fine I'll take someone else, fully expecting her to later apologize and say she is coming.

But the apology never came. In fact her attitude got worse and she got into trouble at school. She asked me if I got her the clothes and I told her no, I'm sticking to my word. I don't think she believed me. Well her birthday came and she realized I wasn't bluffing. I didn't get her any gifts. She was appalled and I was the worst mother ever. I told her she's learned a valuable lesson. I really wanted to make her birthday special but she was being awful. Of course other relatives got her things but none from me.

She told her grandparents her side of the story. Which was of course all one sided making her out as a victim. They called me and I explained to them the whole truth. They also think I'm awful and the ""poor girl"" needs gifts from her mother. I told them next year will be different if she behaves.

1cuhn0r,AITA for telling my girlfriend not to call my dad “doctor”?,"

My(28m) girlfriend recently got her doctorate. I’m obviously very happy for her and proud of her. 

Since then, she has been greeting my father as “Doctor” [lastname]. Although he does have a doctorate degree, no one has ever called him that, and he told me it makes him uncomfortable. 

I asked her to not call him that. She says that she wants to be polite and call him by his title. She now wants to be called doctor when might parents greet her as well. 

I understand it’s a massive accomplishment but I don’t think she should expect my parents to call her doctor? And she should not call my dad doctor if he asks her not to. 

She thinks I’m trying to downplay what she did but I’m not.

1cjlv3y,AITA for failing to stop my MIL buying ‘landfill’ for my kids at a funfair?,"
I went to a local funfair with my kids & mother in law (MIL).

We decided to walk around looking at all the rides before deciding what to go on. 

MIL had forgotten her wallet so it would be me buying any rides. (This let me relax about the sometimes tricky dynamic of who is paying for what.)

As we walked past a prize stall (pay money to win a prize), MIL commented in shock at the high price & I agreed.

At the next ride, my husband joined us. He & I were chatting when we noticed that MIL had gone back to the previous prize stall with the kids.

He asked urgently what I had agreed with her about that stall, & I (slightly confused at his urgency) remembered we had both thought it overpriced.

I knew she didn’t have money on her so I assumed they had just gone back to look.

We have disagreed with MIL many times about her excessive (in our view) gifts for the kids. Each visit she buys toys which soon get discarded, or more sweets & snacks than the kids can eat.

This is important to us because (a) we want to teach the kids moderation & value rather than excessive disposable expenditure, (b) we are worried about the environment & the excess of toys contributes to landfill, (c) while she has the right to use her money, the amount spent on this stuff feels wasteful when it could be used for more lasting things for the kids.

Back to the fun fair.

My husband insisted I tell him what I had “agreed” with MIL. We hadn’t agreed anything, I told him. We agreed it was priced too high?

I then noticed she had taken out her phone to pay using her contactless payment.

Husband said he didn’t want her buying it, & I said he should go tell her. He insisted he didn’t want to do that before finding out what I had agreed with her. 

I told him if he could see what was happening he should go & stop her.

By now it was finished & I said look it’s done now, it’s her money to spend & if she wants to have fun with the kids by spending £15 on a prize stall that’s up to her, & that I hadn’t “agreed” anything with her as I believed she had forgotten her wallet.

After we got home he picked a huge fight with me, telling me he was really distressed by the landfill of the prizes (the toys are already falling apart), & the repeated messages this kind of spending sends to the kids about the value of things. 

His main complaint at me is that when we first saw the stall before he joined us, he insists I should have told MIL not to buy it for the kids, & the facts that (a) I believed she had no means of paying & (b) had commented on how overpriced it was were not relevant, I still should explicitly have said that we didn’t want her to buy anything. 

I think this is unreasonable & would have made things really awkward at what was supposed to be a fun outing.

He says it’s my fault that MIL spent her money on poor quality prizes which will be landfill by next week.

1cob8oh,AITA for accepting a part in a play even though my boyfriend doesn't approve?,"I (16, F) have been a part of my school's theater company since I was in middle school. Theater means a lot to me, and it's given me a community of silly, talented, amazing people that make up my core friend group. While they would get all the leads for each show (both at our school and local community theaters), I never got anything higher than an ensemble part or a part with a few lines, and it always hurt me a lot because I would feel excluded. I've never let myself feel too discouraged by this, and I've been able to do a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff for shows I'm not a huge part of, like building sets, making props, and directing. This would always be super fun, but never as fun as being onstage and being a part of all the inside jokes my other friends would bring up outside of rehearsals (and this only added to me feeling excluded).

Anyway, me and my friends all auditioned for a local teen production of Little Shop of Horrors last week, with four of us (including me) all auditioning for Audrey. We audition, and I think I do pretty well, but part of me knows I won't get the part. Well, yesterday, the cast list came out, and to my surprise, I GOT AUDREY!! I'm so excited and still buzzing over the fact that I finally have a lead, and one of my dream roles no less. All of my friends were extremely supportive and there was no tension among any of us over the results of the cast list, so I accepted the part right away before dancing around my room and going out for ice cream with my friends. 

When I got back, I texted my boyfriend of a year (17, M) about the news, expecting congratulations and excitement (since he knows how big of a deal finally getting a lead is for me), but instead, he told me I should reject the part because I'd have to kiss the guy playing Seymour, and also generally act romantically around him onstage, and that makes him uncomfortable. The guy playing Seymour is one of my close friends I've known since 7th grade, and our relationship has always been purely platonic (he also has a boyfriend of his own). I can see how my boyfriend would be uncomfortable since I'd be acting romantically with someone who isn't him, and with someone I'm pretty close to. I told him I already accepted my part and he left me on read, and I don't really know how I'm feeling at the moment. I'm hurt because he hasn't congratulated me, but I feel bad for potentially hurting him and accepting the part without talking to him about how it would affect our relationship.

1cpsggj,AITA for asking my friends what flavor their wedding cake is?,"I (22f) am in the wedding party of my friends we will call Em(25f) and Roe(25m) who will be getting married in about 2 months. I have been really excited for the wedding since it'll be an opportunity for all the friends from college to get together for the first time in 2 years. Not to mention Em and Roe are my best friends, or at least I thought they were. 

We have a discord for all the wedding stuff and they have a channel about food. They've been really good about being open about the food they intend to have at the reception including vegan/vegitarian/gluten free options for everyone and answering questions so I didn't think there would be any contention if I asked a question. 

Anyway, about 4 days ago I posted a message into the discord asking ""Hey, what flavor is the cake gonna be? I wanna mentally prepare myself lol."" I think looking back my choice of extra words is what caused all this, but I meant it in the sense that I have a long documented dislike of chocolate flavored foods like cake or ice cream.  So I added it in the event the cake was chocolate. 

I recieved a private message back that the cake would be chocolate and that if I had a problem with it then I could ""shove it"" cause it was their wedding not mine. And i felt really taken aback by this response. 

Never did I mention that I would have been upset and I certainly wouldn't have put up a stink about it. Its exactly like Em had said, it's their wedding. I explained as much and tried to apologize for any offending I did but she got even more defensive and started basically blasting me for implying that she was offended and I was just left overall very confused. 

I gave it two days before I tried to apologize again and smooth it over figuring she may have just been having a bad day but I got shut down again telling me she didn't need my apology cause nothing was wrong and I needed time stop trying to make it seem like shit was wrong between us and to just drop it. 

I texted Roe to see if I could gauge what was going on since he and I have always had an open dialogue about things like this but he basically just told me he couldn't talk to me right now and I have to imagine its cause Em told him not to. 

Its been 2 days since then and I'm just really confused. This whole thing has made me want to drop out of the wedding party and honestly not go at all. I wish Roe would talk to me and Em would be honest. I can't help but think maybe I just don't get how stressful planning a wedding is and like maybe theyve gotten pushback from other people on other things and somehow its being taken out on me?

She offered to cook dinner as a way to show her gratitude. However, I have a meticulously organized and spotless kitchen due to my severe anxiety around mess and disorder, something that my family is well aware of.

Despite this, after she cooked, the kitchen was left in what I would consider a disastrous state—spills on the counter, pots not cleaned properly, and utensils misplaced. It took me hours just to calm down after seeing the mess. The next day, I calmly explained how distressed it made me feel and asked if she could cover the cost of a professional cleaning service to restore it to its original condition.

She was shocked and upset by my request, arguing that she had already contributed by buying groceries and spending her evening cooking for us. My husband thinks I was too harsh and should have cleaned it myself or let it go this time. This has caused tension between us and his sister.

I'm very close with my kids, my son is engaged to Abbie, she seems nice but has been a bit pushy trying to create relationships with me and my wife, though she's also awkward with her. Abbie isn't close to her family, she told us many stories why and while some of her complaints don't seem awful, it's not my place to judge and I didn't live it so I can't know anyway. 

We've tried to be welcoming but Abbie has forced her way into some family traditions where she wouldn't have been invited, and some where no one outside of specific family would have. She has been calling Sally ""sis"" since they were only dating a few months, has an odd sister/mother-in-law thing she does with my wife, and the one I'm not a fan of, wants me to be like father to her. Not because we've clicked or anything. We are very different people, not saying that in a bad way, just saying it's not based on how we get along or anything. 

My kids and I have a tradition when they come over that we have a private catch-up in my office/study before they leave, which is now even more important to them because while they both get along well with my wife they don't want to have personal conversations around her yet. Abbie asked if we could talk, and after I explained the tradition John later asked that I do it, saying she'd never had a caring conversation with her dad. We compromised that I didn't include her in the tradition but do join the two of them for coffee and let her talk. Then she started calling me dad, they werent even engaged yet, John pulled me aside and begged me to give her that, laid this whole thing on me about me always being the dad she always wanted right in front of her and she just wanted that, told me she cried watching me and Sally together (she still gives me random hugs, I'm a lucky dad). I didn't like it but I do feel bad so fine I gave her that. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and the father/daughter dance. I don't want to walk her down, and I walk with a cane so dancing is hard. At my own wedding I only danced twice. John is begging for me to do one, preferably the aisle. 

They came over Sunday, John and I were talking, I thought to address it, when Ab walked in without knocking, asking if he'd told me yet. I asked what, John said she wanted me to say something about having a second daughter now in my speech and how I loved her. I just looked at him. She asked if I'd do the walk and dance for Sally, I said of course. She yelled she's my daughter too and I said it will never be the same, Sally is my actual daughter.

I suggested a few places like pizza, Chinese, sushi, Korean, etc. People gave opinions, like they were/weren't feeling XYZ or they have certain allergies. This one girl, Abbie, never spoke up even when I specifically asked her. I didn't know her well but wanted to include her, but she would just mumble and not give a definitive answer. Eventually we settled on korean food.

There were few people in the group who weren't too familiar with the food so I explained the menu. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food and I thought that was that.

Towards the end of the meal, Abbie started whining about the food. She didn't like this, she didn't like that, she was unfamiliar with the food, she couldn't even ""choose"" the restaurant. Few people reminded her that I specifically asked her where she wanted to eat and it was a group consensus. (Just for the record, I'm an introvert but can be very opinionated and can speak up for myself.)

I asked Abbie why she didn't speak up earlier and she responded she didn't want to upset anyone. My tone turned harsher and said ""well you could've said something earlier instead of whining and causing a scene now. Why bring it up at the end of it if you didn't want to cause trouble?""

Abbie's face turned red as she got up, paid, and left.

1cs6609,AITA for not wanting to visit my wife's grandparents after they gave my brother-in-law (BIL) a 50K truck?,"My BIL is a 28M with no job who lives in my in-law's basement. He is obese and survives off of welfare cheques from the Canadian government. He is capable of working but chooses not to. My wife on the other hand (26F) moved out at 18, self-funded a degree, works in a good field (80K annually), got married, and has never sought a hand-out from her parents or her grandparents even though they both have the means.

We spent our vacation time the last two years visiting her grandparents who live across the country. Recently her grandparents (85), moved out of their house and into retirement living and no longer had space for both of their vehicles. Her grandpa decided to gift my BIL a truck with a fair value of $50,000. His justification was to ""help him build confidence"" and ""give him something to care for."" My wife was given nothing and they did not do anything to even out the gift.

We have a trip planned to visit them in a few months, but I have no interest in going to see them. I am mad at myself for letting money ruin my perception of them, but I do not appreciate how my wife was treated. I feel they take her for granted. We always go out of our to visit them. All of our trips are self-funded. We have never asked anything of them while lots of her cousins have been baled out financially. I just have an icky feeling about the whole thing.

My wife got upset when I told her I wanted to do something else with our vacation time. She got really upset and it led to an argument. She took the stance we have to enjoy our time with them while we have it.

My wife and I are currently saving for our first house, paying off student loans, and saving for our first child. We still drive my very first car I bought 10 years ago. The situation stings, as we could have used the help, while her brother lives a free ride and gets nothing but help all the time.

1cvat3q,AITA For Requesting My Husband and Kids not Wear Noise-Cancelling Headphones?,"I (43f) have two children (M14 and F13) with my husband (M44). 

Both my kids, and my husband all have noise cancelling headphones. Airpods, beats, you name it (And fun fact, today I found out that my son had a box of Airpods Maxes in his closet, and I'm pretty sure those are mine) and honestly, I don't like when the wear both earbuds, or have headphones full on on their head. 

I don't like the fact that when they wear them, I could be screaming their name to the top of my lungs, and they still can't hear me. If something happens, I would want them to be able to hear me. In fact, even when my son is doing the dishes i could be saying his name and he wouldn't even know I was there.

I considered (and went through with) asking them to not not wear headphones in the house, but just no noise cancelling or one side in one side out. They all obviously put up a fight about it, saying that ""I can just call them,"" but what if something happens where I need to get their attention, but can't reach my phone?

1ci0153,AITA for thinking each of my kids getting their own room is more important than my new husband having 3 to himself?,"My new husband and I agreed before we scheduled our wedding that, even though space would be tight, we would lIve in his house. We have a master bedroom & a second bedroom upstairs, a main floor office/bedroom, and a finished basement with a legal bedroom, a second good- size room, and a storage room. Each floor has a full bathroom. We have 3 children who live with us, 17, 14 & 12. They are all mine, his are all out of the house. We decided to give the basement bedroom to the 17, upstairs second bedroom to the 14, and the office to the 12. That would leave the second room and storage room in the basement for my husband's exclusive use for his activities- magic & writing. WE ALL 5 AGREED TO THIS. 

We married in December and moved in towards the end of March. He was nowhere near ready (chronically late), but I had a tenant moving into my home and we had to leave it. Now we've been here a month (with a box or two & a suitcase each, most the rest is in a storage unit or was sold/donated/tossed) and my husband just decided he writes best in the office, so the 12 & 14 year- olds will have to share a room. I think he's being selfish, he could easily write in his magic room, which he has to himself. As a compromise, my 12 said he could have his office and give the her the storage room instead (I'm sure I could fix it up nice for her!). He says no, he needs all 3 rooms to be able to write and do magic. He & I have dated/been married for almost 6 years now and he's maybe used each room 5 times. He's disabled but wants to try to make some money on the side as a magician (he's great & he was an outstanding magician in his youth, so this may be possible). I just don't think he requires 3 tooms of the house to do this, that 2 should be sufficient. 
The only other 2 rooms in the house are the kitchen (my husband also cooks and has every gadget and ingredient, so there isn't always a place to sit in there...) and the living/dining room (one room). My husband spends most of his time watching tv or researching magic tricks in the living/dining, so the kids can't really hang out in there, either. So the only place they have where they can choose what they do or have alone time is their room. 
I am paying half the mortgage, all the food, and for everything the kids or I need. He pays the other half the mortgage, gas/electric, and for everything he needs. If he has a show (he did one last fall) we ALL help (making things, set up, tear down) and I invest $4 figures in it. So we feel like we're being supportive.
I think each kid should get their own room, AS WAS AGREED to before we got married. And my husband should make it work with 2 rooms instead of 3.

1cke3wt,AITA for having a bigger reaction to a strangers gift then my husbands?,"For Context: I 30F just had birthday, my husband got me 30 gifts to mark the event. Nothing big, just different little items. None of the items were anything I’d buy myself in particular. My husband has the habit of buying things he likes or finds cool but not really thinking of the other person. For example: one of the items was a nice set of colored pencils, I have a specific art style and only draw with black pens. Or a nice vase that is very specifically his style. 

However I was still extremely grateful and made sure he knew this. 

My sisters own a bar, so I go there and am around quite often. They have a regular who comes to the bar maybe 2 times a week for the last 2 years so I see him pretty frequently. I’d never seen him outside of the bar. We have a joke about how aliens are probably watching all of us and every once in a while throw crazy things at us just to see how it plays out. 

Anyways the other day we went in to have drinks for my birthday, the regular came and told me happy birthday and handed my a small pouch. In the pouch was 100 dollars and a small silver alien holding a diamond. Also a note that said, “I’m hoping the aliens give you everything you deserve.”

I started crying, it was just so thoughtful especially since I was expecting anything. I thanked him and gave a hug, he went about his way. My husband was acting strangely the rest of the night. When we got home I asked what was wrong and he told me that he was upset about the way I reacted to the gift. He said I didn’t act that way about his gift that he worked really hard on. He said that it was inappropriate for the regular to give me a gift. He said I was a AH for reacting that way especially in front of him. But it was just a natural reaction. He doesn’t want me to keep the gift. 

I feel really badly but I want to keep the gift. So AITA? 

Not a real diamond and he gives $100 to all the staff on their birthday. 

I just want to thank everyone for the responses, it gave me a lot to think on. I will say this an a man twice my age, I’m 99% sure he likes men and in no way it remotely flirtatious in my opinion. Also this was not a ring or piece of jewelry it’s just something you put on a desk.

1cqljhp,AITA for refusing to wear the dress my mother-in-law bought me?,"About 2 weeks ago was my brother-in-law's wedding and they were VERY clear that it was a formal event and they wanted everyone dressed nicely. My MIL told me that the dress I planned to wear wasn't formal enough and offered to buy me one that would fit the occasion better since I don't exactly have the money to buy myself a fancy dress right now. Let me be clear that I LOVE my MIL and I was very grateful for her offer. I sent her a link to a dress that I liked and she agreed to order it and have it shipped to me. 

The dress came the other day and it's NOT the one I asked for. It's nice, but its not what I wanted. Its a completely different cut and color from what I asked her to get. Even though it's a nice dress I hated the way it looked on me, so I just wore the dress I was originally planning to wear. It didn't perfectly fit the dress code but I figured it was close enough. Apparently not because the moment my MIL saw me she was asking why I wore it instead of the dress she bought me. She was very upset at me for not wearing the other dress considering she paid for it (which I understand but it still wasn't what I asked for).

When I told her it was the wrong dress she said that she ordered a different one on purpose because she thought it would ""fit me better"". Which it didn't because it looked awful on me. She also said the one I sent her was a bit pricey, but she's not exactly living paycheck to paycheck, she has the money for it. She let it go after a while but I'm starting to feel bad for it. I wasted her money and looking back what I wore did stick out a bit.

1cl4gmd,AITA for not treating my step daughter like my daughter?,"Iam 38F married to my husband 42M. Back when I was 16 I gave birth to my daughter, Mary, dad deadbeat but we’re fine now anyways. I started business in my early 20s and now Im considerably wealthy. My husband has a daughter, jane, who’s only 1 year older than Mary. We got married 2 years ago and one of our main “aims” with this marriage was to have a nice accompany as we both had almost the same experience with love/sex/birth as his ex left him with Jane just like my ex left me with Mary. However,Im objectively wealthier than my husband, he’s not poor , I just make more money and finances never been a main topic to us both thankfully. 

Now Mary works in a certain institution and makes her own money and pays her own bills. But I also like to spoil her with money and luxury and we travel alot together sometimes I give her money to travel alone. Like she’s fine on her own financially but I give her always. Also Mary has a boyfriend he’s somewhat well off and always pays for their dates so Mary wanted to surprise him on his birthday but her plans were kind off above budget so I paid the rest. 

Everything was fine until  Jane called me saying she wants me to give her 2K for her and her friends to travel for a little vacation. I told her 2K for a vacation is alot I can help her with sone but she then brought up everything I get and pay for Mary and never her. I told her because Mary has no one but me, as my husband doesn’t contribute anything to Mary so obviously I’ll direct my efforts to her and she also work she doesn’t just depend on me. Let’s just say that phone call wasn’t the nicest. 

I know the whole perception of if you marry someone with kids then they’re your kids too, sure Jane is not a kid she was 21 when I got married to her father. So that’s why it was never logical for me to become her mother just like she never tried to become my daughter just like my husband never tried to be Mary’s father.

1czwzo4,AITA for “breaking” my vegan diet?,"Hi people, 

My entire family are vegans, my dad especially is a very “vocal” vegan. He goes to vegan protests, was in vegan groups in our old city, he’s a vegan activist. Which I love, I’m not trying to paint those things as bad I really respect him for his thoughts. 

My brother and I have both been raised vegan our entire lives. At school it’s always made me feel “othered” is the best way to explain it. Never able to eat anything sold in the school canteen, at friend’s birthdays never able to eat a piece of cake with my friends, or have to be the one who says “we can’t go to that restaurant they don’t serve any vegan food”. Always having to explain why I’m not allowed to “try a bite” of their sandwich. They aren’t huge things but they are things that make me stick out. Since I’m an awkward guy anyway, it just doesn’t help me socially. So when we moved cities and I joined a new school last Monday I decided that I’m not going to follow the vegan diet while I’m at school. I kept this to myself because I know my parents wouldn’t support it and would be angry. 

When at home, or with my parents I will follow the vegan diet but if I’m out with my friends or at school I’m not going to say, in my mind this was respectful of my parents wishes. No meat in the house or around them but my myself is different. My brother and I both go to this new school. Since we don’t share a dinner time I didn’t tell him that I wasn’t going to follow the vegan diet, I didn’t think he would support it and I thought he would tell dad. 

Things have been going alright but I didn’t know that on Fridays my brother’s dinner time would be at the same time as mine. I was sitting with some new friend and I was eating a cheese pizza (this is the only non-vegan food I’ve eaten so far. I want to try pepperoni but still feel a little scared) and my brother caught me and asked what I was doing eating pizza. 

I tried to play it off but I knew I was screwed, my brother told my parents and now everyone is really upset at me. I’ve been grounded and my dad said he’s going to call my new school and tell them that if they sell me non-vegan food he will put in a discrimination complaint. Which is just going to make me seem like a weirdo now. 

I tried to explain to him that I was trying to be respectful by not doing it here, but my parents just gave me a huge lecture about how I’m so selfish for breaking the diet. He said he can’t trust me anymore and now I feel guilty in one half of my brain and in another I’m telling myself it isn’t that big of a deal and they’re overreacting. 

But I don’t know if I’m just being blind. 

Please, no debates about the ethics of the vegan diet. I don’t care to debate it with anyone I’m sure there are subreddits where people will be happy to. Please focus on my situation when giving your verdict.",Vegan-conundrum,1274,893,0.8899999856948853,0.2027361790746079,1716589204,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1czwzo4/aita_for_breaking_my_vegan_diet/,2024,5,AmItheAsshole,2024-05-24 22:20:04
1clxt18,AITA for not putting off school to take in my nephews?,"Throwaway for privacy.

I (30F) have a very small, not very close family. I have an aunt and uncle, who have three children (my cousins, two of whom are still minors) and I had my sister (40f). My parents have passed away. My sister and I weren't very close. She had three boys (9,7, and 6) and was a single mom. 

Last year I was accepted to a PhD program. I am set to start in the fall and I plan on moving in a couple months to get settled before the semester starts.

My sister passed away just after the start of the year. She had some health issues that unfortunately caught up with her. Obviously I was still upset to hear of her passing and went to her funeral. After the funeral, my aunt and uncle asked to meet.

My nephews are staying with them for the time being, but they want me to take over their care. I explained to them that I couldn't since I was moving soon to attend my program. They urged me to put it off. I told them it didn't work like that. I couldn't put things off until all three of the boys were able to be on their own. They asked if I could take them with me and I told them that wasn't possible.

1cpt7jl,AITA for revealing at a Dinner I am the one who makes more money?,"A little context for this post I (33F) have been dating my Partner (34M) casually for 3 years and 8 months. Over the last 8 months we have gotten more serious. He works in IT and as I ""Only"" work behind a bar in a strip club he seemed to always assume I make much less than him, he'd always say that he never wanted us to discuss money as he didn't want me to feel embarrassed so I never brought it up as I didn't care even if I found it a bit funny despite the fact I own both my car and home while he is renting and paying off his car.

I like him though so I brushed it aside figuring if we ever moved in together then we could talk about our finances and be open about it. Despite him thinking I only work behind the bar, I am actually a Mixologist at a high end Strip Club, so on top of a very generous salary I actually make amazing tips most nights too, i've worked at the same place for 9 years and I love it there.

As things are getting more serious he wanted me to meet his parents and I agreed, yesterday we had dinner with his parents and they clearly didn't approve of me and during the dinner his Mother brought up that she didn't think this was a good idea but if he was insisting on doing this when we got married we'd need to have a prenuptial agreement to protect her son. I was silent waiting for my partner to say anything but he didn't. He just continued to eat and I got annoyed before agreeing with her. I told her I fully agreed that we needed a Prenup as i'd need to protect my assets, this led to some laughs from around the table and I finally asked my boyfriend how much he made, he tried to brush it off before finally revealing he made £25,000 a year and telling me it was fine and not to feel less.

I won't lie I burst into laughter right there at the table not caring that I was being rude and bluntly told him not including my tips I make £43,291 a year they didn't believe me so I began to point out how I go on holiday twice a year, how I own my home and car while he rents and is paying off, how I always bought him nice gifts. I then told him for perhaps the hundredth time that i'm a Mixologist not a Bartender.

The dinner got silent and on the drive to my home he berated me the entire time for embarrassing him, and how could I have not told him I made that much money, that I should have told him from the start. I reminded him that he didn't want us to talk about money and I figured when and if we one day moved in together that we'd talk about our finances then. He kept talking about how I should have just privately told him after the dinner then and not embarrassed him in front of his parents but when I asked him then why he didn't defend me when his mother embarrassed me he had no answer.

1cp3df4,AITA for not giving my sister any of my money even though I am in a significantly better financial situation?,"My (26F) sister (32F) ""Bethy"" and I are both stay-at-home moms. I have 1F twins; she has three sons, 6M, 4M, and 2M.

My husband, Micheal, is a master plumber who makes excellent money; he owns his own business, and I couldn't be prouder of him. I used to be a librarian; I have my MLS and bachelor's in Education. During the birth of our girls, on the way to the hospital in the ambulance, we hit a speed bump, and I was injured. I am now an ambulatory wheelchair user and attend physical therapy, as I am learning to walk again. I hurt from my hips down, but my babies are worth it. We decided I would be a SAHM after my first surgery, and my husband gives me $3000/month to use how I want to, as ""payment for being such a good mom"" We are extraordinarily blessed financially, and I'm happy being able to see my girls growing up.

Bethy's husband, Jackson, is an elementary school teacher, but teaching doesn't pay much in our state. Bethy has been a SAHM for the entirety of her marriage and is used to having to scrimp and save for things.

She asked me out for coffee recently and I accepted. I was chatting with her when I mentioned that our girls would start baby swim classes soon. I was happy the pool was wheelchair accessible. Bethy started ranting about how expensive swimming lessons are and how she could never afford to put her boys in swimming. I said I was also excited about playgroup this week, as I had been nervous to go the first time we had gone because none of the other moms and dads in the group used mobility aids. When I mentioned the name of the playgroup I go to with my girls, Bethy became angry because it's one of the more expensive playgroups.

She was angry because ""I knew money was tight."" and ""I didn't even think to invite her and Jackson's son because then she wouldn't have to pay for daycare. She then asked if my husband gave me an allowance. She was a bit angry, and people were starting to stare, so I said yes and asked her to keep her voice down. She wondered how much it was, and I told her. She asked if I could give it to her, and I told her no because I like to treat myself after my physio appointments, and I want to save as much as possible for a rainy day fund.

Bethy said she and her husband have nothing but rainy days and left the restaurant without paying. I feel embarrassed and ashamed that I'm not helping her when I know I could. Still, when I asked Micheal he said that my sister could get a job and reminded me that I became a SAHM because it was something we agreed we were financially stable enough to do as well as because of my mobility limitations. He also said I deserve nice things and shouldn't have to give them up just because my sister wants me to.

I feel conflicted, AITA? If more people think I am, I'll consider giving her the monthly payment; I feel guilty for not helping.",SAHMAITAThrowRA,2275,658,0.9399999976158142,0.1878669616503883,1715383471,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cp3df4/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_any_of_my_money/,2024,5,AmItheAsshole,2024-05-10 23:24:31
1cw1rrj,AITA for being uncomfortable with my wife's band posters?,"I (31m) have been married to my wife (30f) for 5 years now. I love her so much, and I am so incredibly lucky to be married to her, but there is one thing that really bothers me.

She has always been a huge fan of a lot of rock bands, particularly emo bands. This by itself doesn't bother me at all, in fact I love the music too and we go to concerts together all the time. What bothers me is that she has posters of these bands tacked up everywhere around our house. Our bedroom walls are COVERED in them. And I mean covered. There is not a single inch of wall space in our bedroom that is not dedicated to her band posters. Everywhere I go, everything I do, therd are always eyes of a hundred emo men following me around. It sounds stupid, and it probably is to be honest, but I don't think I can stand another night's sleep feeling like I am being watched constantly. I don't want to be ""watched"" by the members of My Chemical Romance or Taking Back Sunday or 21 pilots as we make love. 

I've tried asking her nicely to move some of them and she gets really offended and mad at me so I just left it behind. But it's getting hard to handle.

1ci13ea,AITA for refusing to knit a blanket for my new grandson even though I’ve made them for my other grandchildren?,"I 53F am married to my husband Dan 59M. Dan has 2 kids Jack 35M and Adam 31M with his ex and I have two kids 29M and 27F with my ex. As a blended family, our kids have all been supportive and they were all out the house by the time we started dating so they didn’t care. 

All of our kids have children, so for all my grandchildren I have knitted a blanket for when my grandkids first leave the hospital, which has been a tradition since I made the first one. 

Adam has recently introduced us to Kate 30F, his coworker. Kate was married and Adam was dating Sarah 33F, who at the time was pregnant with my grandson (Adam and Sarah’s second baby), when Kate and Adam started their affair. Kate realised she was pregnant so she got a divorce and Adam broke up with Sarah. Adam and Kate’s relationship has not gone down well with anyone, with Dan and Jack  refusing to see Kate or Adam. Dan’s ex cheated on him which is still a sore topic for Dan and Jack as he remembers his mom and why they have especially struggled. 

Through this, I have maintained a relationship with Sarah who is really struggling. Her family haven’t spoken to her since she had my granddaughter Annie 3F without being married. Adam didn’t go to a single appointment for Sarah and instead I have gone with her which has created a rift between me and Adam as I refuse to go with Kate.

The blankets I make are very intricate, and take months to make as I make them slowly. I decided to only make one for Sarah’s baby and not Kate’s, Adam never asked for a blanket so I assumed he understood I was not making him and Kate one. I maintain a civil relationship with Adam but I am also upset at how he treated Sarah, and how he now ignores her and their baby.

Sarah recently had her baby and I was with her whilst she was in labour. I gave her the blanket and she posted her baby’s hand and the blanket on her social media. Adam has contacted me to say Kate is infested in having a blanket for their baby and he told me how much it would mean to them as Kate has no family and they ant their child to be part of the family and think that we will all come around later.

I am on the fence, I am angry for Sarah and her baby but Adam is family and I don’t want to make rash decisions that can cause more drama in the family especially as Adam’s and Sarah’s two kids are involved, with Annie old enough to understand the dynamics.

1d23txo,AITA for refusing to pay off my boyfriend's overdraft?,"I've known Ron as a casual acquaintance for a few years, but we started dating about two weeks ago.  I'm 19 and he's 20.  He has a full-time job and only pays his mum £40 a week for bills/food.  His only other expense is his car.  So he has a lot of disposable income, but he doesn't save, he blows it all on nonsense like gadgets that he then never uses again.  So much so that he's overdrawn by £2K.

I'm a full-time student who babysits on the side, and I'm frugal.   I've managed to save £3K.  It has taken me about 2 or 3 years to save that.  Tonight I mentioned that some friends of mine are going on holiday in September and I am going to join them.  Ron asked me ""How will you pay for that, you don't have a job apart from babysitting.""  I said ""I have £3K in savings, so I will just use some of that.""

Suddenly Ron got a really calculating look in his eyes, and just outright asked me to pay off his overdraft.  He said he would pay me back £200 a month.  I said he should just pay off his own OD at £200 a month.  He said ""But then I have to pay interest!""

I refused to lend him the money for several reasons:

1. He's such a spendthrift I don't believe he would pay me back.  If he can't set aside £200 a month to pay off his own OD, he is not going to set aside £200 a month to pay me back.

2. I earn a small amount of interest on my savings.  Why should I lose that to save him interest?

3. What if I have an emergency, or an opportunity like my upcoming holiday?  I then  won't have any money to pay for it.

And I didn't say this one to him, but also I don't want to lend him the money because he has such a bloody cheek.  I know we've casually known each other (friends of friends) for a few years but we're only really just now getting to know each other properly and I just think it's such a rude and selfish thing to ask.  It's really made me see him in a different light and I don't like what I'm seeing.  Anyway he thinks I'm the one being selfish because the money is ""just sitting there"" and I ""don't really need it.""

1cs4uw5,AITA because I didn't want to cook a steak on mother's day?,"I (40f) and my husband (41m) have been married 21 years. We have several children the oldest is 20 the youngest is 5. 
Mother's day has always been a point of contention. I really wish he would do something nice for me but he always tells me ""you aren't my mom,"" and does nothing noteworthy. It's gotten worse over the years and came to a boiling point two days ago (mother's day) 
I had reminded everyone that mother's day was coming up but on the day everyone except our 20 and 18 year olds forgot. 20m works all day he came over late in the evening, and 18 said happy mother's Day in the morning before he left for work.  I can't really fault the other  kids for it as many of them are young. By noon I was almost in tears. 

When my husband came out of his man cave and told me he wanted me to cook steak for lunch I almost broke down crying. I cook almost every day for everyone and I really just did not want to cook on mothers day. 

I left the house, went for a walk and bought myself a pizza. When I came home I put his steak in the air fryer. Which was apparently wrong and he got mad about it. 
As he was scolding me over cooking the steak wrong I started crying and said ""it's mother's day!! "" And his response was.... 
He yelled at me for wanting to be the center of attention and told me ""you aren't my mother! You did not give birth to me!"" 

He spent the rest of the day angry at me. He refused to eat the rest of the day. He said he wanted steak to be something nice we did together and I said I didn't want to have to cook because it was mother's day and I wanted him to do something for me but he didn't want to so I went for pizza alone. 

Around dinner time he made a steak and I thought it was for him as I had already eaten but he put it in front of me and told me I better enjoy it. I ate about half it was a huge steak the size of the plate.

I tried to talk to him later he got angry and stormed out. The next day he was still angry. I told him he really hurt my feelings and he said ""you say every other day that I'm hurting your feelings. You always take things wrong, so I guess I just won't talk at all that way you can't take anything wrong."" 

He wants me to act happy so I've been trying to but now it's been two days and he's still angry with me. He keeps sitting on the couch arms crossed refusing to speak or anything. 

Maybe I should have just cooked the steak and not gone out? Am I being unreasonable, after all I'm not his mom. It's just that, as the mother of his children it would be nice to be celebrated on mothers day for once.

1d4gqm8,AITA for telling my mom I don’t want to care for her kids ,"AITA for not wanting to care for my siblings

I (20f) have a sister (16f) and two half siblings from our mom’s new marriage (3m) and an infant sister. My mom insists on my help with the youngest siblings, constantly, without notice. She wants me to babysit, or feed them, or give them baths. Most of the time it’s fine, but sometimes it’s overboard. For context in my reactions: I have autism, high functioning/ Asperger’s.

The situation: Today she asked me to give them baths, I did. It was hard because of my sensory issues and the fact they were both screaming bloody murder in my ear over wanting my mom to give them baths instead. It was okay though, I pushed through, got them dressed through the screaming. Then I left them in the living room with her and started to go back to my room. She asked if I could hold the baby a little longer. I did, but she was screaming and crying still, so it was hard. The only time she’d calm down was if my mom held her, and she didn’t want to because she was getting ready to leave for an AA meeting. At this point I was extremely overstimulated. I was standing sort of rigid, but still holding the baby acceptably, I thought. She began to yell at me, saying I wasn’t holding her with the right body language, and if I held her “like I cared about her” she wouldn’t cry. I told her she’s probably crying because she wants to be held by her mom, separation anxiety, because no matter how much I coddled her before, she still cried. This is a consistent thing that’s happened since my sister started going to daycare. Maybe I am a bit rigid after being screamed at, but still I don’t feel like my body language was the issue. My mom eventually got fed up and told me to put her in the feeding chair, so I did and started to walk back to my room. She then started to rant on about how she still needs my help with watching them longer and how I don’t care about my brother and sister. She said she shouldn’t have to ask for help. It didn’t even occur to me that it was assumed for me to stick around and watch them because their father is home. All she asked was that I give them a bath, then hold the baby, and I did that. This escalated into an argument in which I told her that her children aren’t my responsibility, especially not at 20 years old, and while I don’t have a problem helping out sometimes, I’m not her employee and both can’t (because of autism) and won’t (because I wouldn’t want to if I could) predict what she wants from me in order to wait on her hand and foot.

I do live at home for free, so it could be entitled of me to be so averse to helping her with them. I do other things, I’m the only one in the house who cleans regularly (every other day) and that’s easy for me as it doesn’t involve any crazy variables & never changes. But I do not want to help with my siblings the amount she wants.",kydism,2767,295,0.959999978542328,0.1345386253449557,1717109587,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1d4gqm8/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_dont_want_to_care_for/,2024,5,AmItheAsshole,2024-05-30 22:53:07
1cobi5n,AITA For Wanting Mothers Day to be About Me? ,"I (30f) gave birth last year and so this year will be my first Mothers Day this Sunday. This upcoming Monday also happens to be my MILs (63f) birthday. Every year my husband (32m), and his brothers ( 29M, 25M) and FIL have celebrated both MILs birthday and Mothers Day on the same day no matter what day Mothers Day fell on that year. I was all too happy to celebrate both occasions with them because I lost my mom when I was 8 to ovarian cancer so I never really celebrated Mothers Day until I met my husband.

This year however, I would like to celebrate Mothers Day with just myself, my husband, and our daughter. I tried to encourage other plans on Saturday, a day filled with fun, food, and activities that MIL likes but have been shot down. I even asked if the three of us could do breakfast/brunch and then we go over to MILs to celebrate but this was also unacceptable. Both Mothers Day and birthday must be celebrated on the same day. I tried to talk to MIL about it but she said that this is the way it's been for years and it isn't going to change now and that maybe we (my husband and I) can do Mothers Day things another day.

So this is where I might be the asshole; I told my husband he is welcome to go and spend the whole day with his mom, dad, and brothers but I will be staying home and celebrating with the wee potato who made me a mom, we're going to watch Bluey and make tiny blueberry pancakes (her favourite, lol). My husband says I'm being unreasonable and that we can celebrate another time, that his mom just loves celebrating being a mom and her birthday together with the ones she loves and that it would be awkward if her first grandchild isn't there to help her celebrate (BILs have partners but do not have children yet). I told him I am standing firm on this and he got angry and went to our room. He's been in there for a couple of hours now and I'm starting to feel bad for putting him on the spot like that and making him choose how to celebrate.

1cujoln,AITA for not letting my neighbors use my backyard?,"Created an account to ask.

My partner and I (F30s) just got some new neighbors. They moved in about a month ago. We met them briefly. They are a couple around our age and a daughter who might be 4 or 5, and a dog. 

We have our backyard fully fenced in with a privacy fence. Their yard doesn't. I was out front last weekend when the couple came up our driveway and started chatting. They mentioned that they were on a waiting list to get their yard fenced in but were told it would be a few months. They said they would really like their daughter and dog to have a place to run around but didn't feel comfortable with the lack of fence (our neighborhood backs up to a wooded area and a creek). 

They asked if they could borrow our backyard for a few hours a day so they could let everyone run worry free. I admittedly immediately didn't like this, but I told them I would think about it.

I talked to my partner, and we both agreed this wasn't a good idea. We have two dogs ourselves, and they can be a tad protective of their yard. One of them also doesn't love kids and the other one can be a tad dog selective. Because of this, we would have to coordinate when we could let our dogs out and that's just not something we want to deal with. There are just too many things that could go wrong. Plus that good ole American worry that if someone got hurt we could get sued. 

The guy stopped by again on Wednesday and asked if we had given it any thought. I told him we had discussed it, and unfortunately it just wasn't going to work out with our dogs and their schedule so we wouldn't be able to accommodate them. He immediately got sour and said it was nice to know how neighborly we were. He left abruptly but I could hear him muttering under his breath.

Him and his wife have made a big show of snuffing us the last couple of days. My partner said they will get over it, and while I'm not going to reconsider, I do feel kind of guilty.

My sister and I are opposites.  She is a dog mom (god I hate writing that) to an extreme degree, My wife and I are not dog people.  When she got the invite she reached out and said her, her boyfriend, and 2 dogs (Small 10 pound dogs) would be there.  I was annoyed and called her to tell her no, her dogs are not allowed.

1cva3j9,AITA for not moving my wedding date? *UPDATE*,"Hey everyone! It's been a while (I forgot my password), but a few people asked for updates on how my last post turned out. Unfortunately, a lot of you may not like the answer. 

Almost all of you said not to change the date, and to enjoy my time without them there. I followed half of that advice. I eventually did relent to my family and change the date of the wedding. My fiancé (now husband!) said that the date wasn't as important as my happiness, and the fighting with my parents was destroying that. Now after six months, we both wish we hadn't because it was useless.

They still didn't show up. Not only that, but they convinced 90% of my family not to show up either. I ended up with only four relatives there in a crowd of about 100 guests.

My mother claimed that I had been ""excluding her from planning"" (by scheduling venue tours on days that my fiance and I were both free but I didn't realize she was working, and by finding my dress by surprise on a ""just here to look"" trip without her being there). They hadn't shown any interest in planning, so I mainly didn't want to bother them. To them, this was ""clearly a sign that you don't want us there"". So they went out of town on the new date.

In the end, narcissist mother still got her yoga, I still moved my date, and I still walked myself down the aisle.

But my petty self did, in fact, strike back. I had an amazing time, and I made sure that I left obvious empty seats marked for them and told everyone the truth with a smile when they asked. The few family members that did show are now no longer speaking to them either, as are all of the friends who came. The only exception is my brother (who I'm pretty sure they asked to relay the details of the party to them), and even he has almost entirely cut them out due to how they've acted.

I haven't spoken to my mother since about a month before the wedding, when she told me to get all of my old things out of her house. I speak to my father very rarely, and only over things like deaths in the family. My in-laws have basically taken me in as their own, and I'm far happier than I ever was in the nightmare of a family I grew up with. Life is good.

TLDR: moved the date of the wedding so mom could go to yoga, parents still didn't show, had a better day without them than I would have with them there, finally cut contact with those narcissists",friendlylocalnpc,2730,120,0.9700000286102296,0.10093310221401,1716074271,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cva3j9/aita_for_not_moving_my_wedding_date_update/,2024,5,AmItheAsshole,2024-05-18 23:17:51
1cz7784,AITA because I told my daughter she’ll pay her own bills if she decides to work at a “breastaurant?”,"I (50M) have a daughter that is 17 years old. Before I’m called misogynistic and all that, let me say that I’m pretty much always very supportive of her and what she decides to do. I don’t have, and have never had strict rules. She will be 18 in three weeks. We live in a big city so there’s a lot of those scantily clad restaurants and sports bars, etc. One of her good friends (18f) works at one called Twin Peaks. I’m familiar with it a little, it’s like Hooters but a lot less skin. The everyday uniform is tight, SHORT shorts that expose butt cheeks + a tiny v neck crop top that exposes majority of the breasts. Not great at explaining how it looks but you can Google it. And during some days of the week- they have lingerie days. And obviously the the main crowd is men. 

My daughter’s friend told her that they’re hiring for new waitresses. My daughter wanted an interview now, and the manager said it’s fine but if hired she wouldn’t start until after her 18th birthday. I said no because even if it’s only for 3 more weeks, I’m still gonna try protecting her while I legally can. She plans on going in for a job interview after her 18th regardless. Which is fine, after she’s 18 I cannot do anything about it. But I don’t think a still 17 year old should be interviewed. 

I did sit down with my daughter about this yesterday. I told her I understand she wants to work here because it’ll be a lot of money, but I explained the risks. The creeps. I mentioned there’s a lot of high scale restaurants she can waitress for that don’t include partial nudity. I’m not trying to get into that whole “self respect” territory so I was trying and am still trying to choose my words carefully. But I don’t want old men ogling my barely legal daughter for a quick buck. She is adamant on applying and getting interviewed. She wants to work with her friend and once again, tempted by the money. I told her that I understand her reasoning and will not shame or express disappointment. 

She fired back at me even though I was trying to calmly talk about it and said that she’ll be an adult who can do whatever she wants. Which I never disputed. She’s young and she’s gonna wanna do her own thing, I get it. I told her that if she works there, I will no longer be paying her phone bill. She will pay it monthly. And she will start paying me rent. I will continue to cover her living expenses and once she graduates- I will be paying for her college costs. But for the time being, if she wants this “grown woman” job, and if she wants to yell at me that she’s gonna be an adult, then she’ll get all the responsibilities of an adult.

1cvanvk,AITA for questioning my husband about cross contamination in his food truck?,"Backstory: My husband runs a food truck with his mom in the summer and maintains a daily full time job, I work full time in mental health. We often bicker about everything from who forgot to fill the water pitcher last to whether our mother's are disrespectful to each other. We have a pattern of questioning each other on stuff we know the other knows more about. Further context, I don't work on his truck, but I do maintain the paperwork side of it (accounting, licensing, food safety certifications, etc).

The situation: I brought our toddler up to the truck today to see daddy and grandma, otherwise he doesn't get to see them as much in the summer. A customer asked what they had that was gluten free, and he said they have corn chips for the nachos and corn tortillas. We marinate all our meat by hand and buy fresh veggies and queso for toppings, but we do toast the corn tortillas and the flour tortillas on the same pan for the tacos. So I asked, ""but what about cross contamination?"" in front of the customer. He kind of snapped at me and said, ""it's fine, it's not a problem."" The customer didn't get anything and he lectured me that I don't work on the truck, no one's ever complained, and that he knows what he's doing. I think I'm trying to make sure we don't accidentally make anyone sick and/or get a lawsuit. I know for things like tree nut allergies, even being in the same airspace as a peanut can be deadly for some people, celiac people out there, can it be the same?

1crchyj,AITA for reading romance books despite having a boyfriend?,"I (F24) have been dating my BF (M25) for just over a year, and a few days ago we had an argument that's left me a bit perplexed. I have always been a massive reader, but stuck mostly to fantasy and sci-fi, but 3 months go we read a romance for my book club and I really enjoyed it. So I've been delving into romance.

My boyfriend doesn't read, but will read over the blurb if I leave one of my books around (nothing wrong with that). I finished reading Delilah Green Doesn't Care last week, and left it sitting on the kitchen bench.

Well, a couple days later my boyfriend asked me why I read it. I explained that I enjoyed it? Then he started expressing he was disappointed because he knows that romance books tent to include sex (this one does so he isn't wrong) and he feels really disrespected that I'm reading that sort of thing. He continued saying that it made him feel like I must be unsatisfied and thinking about other people, and that since it was a F/F story, he can't even fulfill those needs.

I tried to explain that isn't true and it's just a story, but he didn't stop there and went on to say that he didn't feel comfortable with me reading that genre anymore. It's been a few days and he won't let it go.

To say I'm a little shocked is an understatement, but what's getting me more is that he told some of our friends and they are taking his side. They all seem to think he has good points and that I wouldn't be seeking out fictional romance stories if I felt secure and happy.

I really didn't think this was an issue, like at all, but I'm starting to doubt that.

1cye3bj,"AITA if I (76M) require my 34 year old daughter to provide her credit card statements, amazon and walmart purchases and bank account statements on request before I loan her money over the summer?","My daughter is 34-years-old and has never been in legal trouble but we feel has trouble with money. She did graduate with her PhD two years ago debt free because of scholarships/stipends. She enrolled as a non-traditional student in medical school that same August. We have helped her out on four occasions the last decade paying off credit card bills we understand to be medical expenses/normal expenses that weren’t met by her stipend of $15,000/year, normally amounts in the $3,000-$5,000 range.

She lives alone rent free in a house I own in exchange for her maintaining the property, which costs about $100-$150/month. She also pays her own utilities which cost about $350/month. We are fortunate to be very comfortable and elected to pay $40,000/year toward her tuition.

My daughter is taking a leave of absence from medical school until September for personal health reasons. She will not receive any funding until then. The school offers about $18,000/year in living loan expenses. She informed me she is currently in $4,000 of credit card debt, $1500 which was school expense related.

She told us she has always been in the red/chasing paying down debt from applying to medical school/the summer between graduate and medical school and she normally spends 2/3 of her bi-yearly living expense loan the moment she receives it to pay down credit card debt. We know for a fact she was clear of all debt in January, at which time she had $4,000 in her checking account.

We feel $1,000/month is more than enough to live comfortably and she should not be in $4000 of debt in late May. She explains that she has the utilities/internet fees, pet expenses, insurance (dental), home upkeep, medication expenses, food, toiletries, gas, car insurance, clothing (she gained a lot of weight and needed to rebuy) and school book/exam expenses. We feel she is also spending money on things she does not need. For example, she purchased color changing lights last month for $60 and some containers (6) for $30 total and $30 on a domino’s pizza. She also sometimes has food delivered by hello fresh/uber eats, about $1000 total since January!

We don’t trust her and are demanding to have access to her credit card statements, amazon account, etc, at random internals from now until May 2026 (graduation) in exchange for helping her through this summer/paying down her debt + subtracting it from what we would pay for her tuition. We want to make sure she is only buying necessities and forbid anything. I have forbidden her, for example, from buying uber eats or pizza again until she graduates.

My daughter feels this is an invasion of her privacy at 34. She explains that if I want to help her I should trust her and she doesn’t want her father telling her she can’t buy a pizza at 34. I feel this is the price she must pay for not managing her money well and that we no longer trust her after seeing how she spends money.

1cjksr1,AITA for asking a deaf person to stop signing in class because it was distracting? ,"First off, for some context, I am a music major in college and I’m all for accessibility, when, let’s say Joe, when Joe introduced himself and his interpreter I said wow! This is really interesting. Not because he’s hard of hearing but rather a deaf person majoring in something which specifically requires hearing is what baffled me. Everything was fine, we all got used to the interpreter being there and no one really payed attention to the fact that he was deaf. Except for one class. A class that everyone as music majors take, a performance recital class. In this class people take turns each week to Perform, in this class it was explained to us in the beginning of the year some of the basic common decency like clapping when they finish singing, not talking, turning off your phone, stuff like that. Just being nice for the performer… you know? Anyways, the year started off fine in this class, but lately you could tell he wasnt signing to his interpreter about the songs , the reason for this is because we sing opera/classical songs in this class so the interpreter didn’t know the language to be fair no one did so she definitely wasn’t translating the songs but rather just cracking jokes! He’s laughing! In the middle of the performances! You could just imagine as a performer seeing someone laugh as you are performing?!  On top of that, this is all happening in the front row! with the interpreter in front of the stage on the side laughing as well! Snickering and giggling all throughout the performance so much so that even one of the performers look to the side to see what happening but just kept singing and ignoring it. I tried ignoring it thinking you know what, he’s deaf, he already has a hard time, no need to bug him more but I finally had enough when a friend of mine sang her song and she and I previously translated the song, it was a very very sad song about death and deleteing yourself. What was Joe doing? Signing, not just signing, SMACKING his hands and laughing bout something else, he made a gesture that you do when someone is pregnant?!?!? You know like the making a circle over your stomach and rubbing anyways Maybe that means something else, but laughing like come on, not just quiet laughing btw audible snickering. Finally I had enough and went up to both him and the interpreter how I understand the need the translate the slate what the teacher is saying and everything the else but that the last song that by friend sang was not a funny song and that it was not only distracting but rude to be talking and laughing while someone is performing even so when your right smack in the front row. The interpreter stayed quiet and he just went on to say that I’m abilist and that it shouldn’t matter what he does because he’s dead and I can’t take he’s mean of communicating, but I’m not saying he should stop, I’m saying in the middle of performances to at least not laugh. Anyways, what do you guys think, AITA?

1cirfdn,"AITA for ""spoiling"" my daughter by taking her on holiday? ","Made this as a throwaway account for personal reasons.

I (M53) split up with my ex-wife (F49) about nine years ago. We have one 17-year-old daughter from the relationship, Tilly, who we share custody of. Due to work commitments, my ex has Tilly most of the weekdays, and I have the weekends. So my ex isn't stuck entirely with the ""boring"" schooldays, she also gets the weeks when Tilly is on vacation.

While my ex got remarried a few years ago, I never did. Although I dated here and there, a combination of work commitments and just not finding the right person meant it never clicked and I've stayed mostly single. I've worked my way up the career ladder as a result and I have a healthy amount of excess income, which I mostly put towards Tilly. I wouldn't say she's spoilt because I still try to give her a sense of responsibility around the house by helping with chores and don't hand out pocket money unless it's earned. However, since I have the means to do so, I do treat her with any clothes, makeup, gadgets, and the like. It's something I enjoy doing and she shows gratitude for it.

On the other hand, my ex is a stay at home mom and her new husband/Tilly's stepdad has a pretty standard job. I don't mean that disrespectfully but.the income generated in the household is average at best for a similar family type. As such, Tilly rarely gets any presents from her mom/stepdad other than on birthdays or any other holidays.

As Tilly's 18th birthday is coming up, I wanted to do something vey special for her, to also tie in with her leaving for college shortly. I arranged a trip to Europe for the two of us for two weeks over the summer. As co-parenting plans have to be arranged, I phoned my ex to say this would be my plan and to sort out all the logistics. To be surprise, my ex exploded at me. She said how I was ""spoiling"" Tilly and was only doing this to spite her because she knew that any gift she gave by comparison would be meaningless, making me the ""favourite parent"". I told her that wasn't true, and I just wanted to give my only daughter a present she'd love and memories to cherish.

Nonetheless, this went on, and my ex called me an asshole over the situation, saying that I need to scale down my present to not spoil Tilly and put us at a ""level playing field"". I laughed and said she was being ridiculous but to avoid any argument, I offered to say this was a ""joint present"" from us both if she/her husband were willing to contribute. This idea was shot down because Tilly ""wasn't stupid"" and knew it would be my present. I was done arguing at this point, so put down the phone.

My ex has text me since, labelling me an asshole again and requesting I rethink. I have no intention of doing so and feel I'm in the right.

1cye9nv,AITA for Not Acknowledging My Co-worker’s Sexuality?,"I am honestly confused about this whole situation, so figured I’d come here. 

I (34F) work in a fairly open-minded, and liberal field, on a team of about 17 people. We recently hired a new person, “Lana” (early 40’s F), and were having a casual, getting to know you session. I noticed she was wearing an engagement ring and wedding band, so I asked what her spouse does for a living. It’s 2024, I always go gender neutral when I don’t know someone. She told me that her wife is a 4th grade teacher. My boyfriend teaches high school bio, so I figured it was something we had in common. I simply said “Oh cool, my boyfriend is a high school teacher. I can only imagine what it’s like for her having to deal with the littles”. Lana just said that she likes working with younger kids, then kind of quickly moved on to talk to someone else. I didn’t think too much of it.

  
Well, earlier today another co-worker came up to me to tell me that Lana felt my response dismissed her telling me that she is a lesbian, and that it was rude of me to “assert” that I was in a heterosexual relationship. My co-worker thinks I should apologize. I definitely will, I don’t want there to be any tension at work, but I really don’t think did anything wrong. I get that coming out is a big deal, and LGBT people often have to do it many times in there lives, but I guess I didn’t even view this as her “coming out” to me. It was a casual conversation, and she casually said “wife” instead of “husband”. I think it would have been silly to emote over the fact that she’s a lesbian, as if it were a big deal. As for my boyfriend comment, I wasn’t trying to assert my heterosexuality, I just thought “hey, we have that in common”. If she had mentioned that she likes playing Stardew Valley I would have jumped on that too.

  
I’m going to try to talk to her tomorrow, but I would like a second opinion. My boyfriend doesn’t think I’m an AH, and my co-workers are sort of on the fence.

1cjk523,WIBTA If I kept some of the insurance money from my car (that my sister totaled),"Update #1: So far I’ve seen similar opinions from everyone and I appreciate everyone’s comment. We’re having a BBQ tonight since my sister just got back from school for the semester. I’m going to bring it up with everyone at dinner and I’ll post a second update letting everyone know how it went. 

Bit of background, I bought a new car in 2022 and gave my old one to my sister after she totaled her last one. Since then, my mother has been paying the car payment for her (she was a minor). With the payment history split between us, I've paid for 60% of the car to date, while my mother has paid the other 40%. My mother came in a told me they were looking at new vehicles today and that she wouldn't mind putting $4-6k down on a car if it meant a low interest and monthly payment (this money comes from the insurance payout being sent to me). I commented that I would need at least $1500 to pay off some credit card debt, and was told no. Now, I don't mind helping out, but I was just told that I wouldn't be receiving any of the insurance money meant to pay for my vehicle, because my younger sister needs it more? Why does the person who has totaled three vehicles in four years need to put $4k+ on a brand new vehicle, and $400 to pay off her credit card, but I can't get $1500 to pay off a credit card to make my life easier?   
  
Would I be the asshole splitting the money based on how it was paid? 60/40. The original loan was 48 months, we have 8 months left, I paid the first 20 and $1500 down, and my mother the second 20. That would give me $3500, much more than I originally asked for, and leave $2500 to pay off her credit card, and the rest as a down payment on another car. I feel like this is going to be an unreasonable offer considering they both assumed they would get the entire amount.

1dgtcsp,AITA for going to my daughter’s graduation after my son relapsed?,"My (M51) wife (F48) and I have two children: Jake (M23) and Jess (F18). 

Although they had the same upbringing, Jake sadly surrounding himself with the wrong people during his late teenage years and made some bad life decisions. Since he was around 17, he's suffered with substance abuse issues and alcohol dependency. He's been through counselling on more than one occasion, and I've lost count of the amount of times that either my wife or I have had to make personal sacrifices to go and tend to him. He's currently living in a Recovery Housing Program, where we hoped he would see improvements.

This has caused understandable issues for Jess. I've missed hockey games and choir performances because I had to go tend to Jake, as has my wife. We try and make it up to her at the time, but I don't think missing important milestones really makes up for it; it's heartbreaking for me personally. 

Jake has been doing better lately, and he hasn't had any relapses or issues for the past few months. Jess' graduation was the other day, and my wife and I had tickets and couldn't wait. She's off to college, graduating with a great GPA and we're really proud of her. 

However, only a couple of hours before the graduation, we received a call from the staff at Jake's Housing Program, who said that he had a relapse incident and was in a really bad way. My wife was hysterical and immediately started telling me we had to go there and help. I refused. I said that we'd missed enough events in Jess' life, and I wasn't missing her graduation. Although my wife told me how sad she was to miss it, Jake's health and wellbeing would take priority. I wasn't changing my stance. She got increasingly agitated and said she'd go herself, called a cab, and went. I took the car and watched Jess' graduation. It was one of the proudest days of my life, but when I saw Jess at the end, I could tell she was visibly upset that her mom wasn't there. I explained and you could tell her frustration.

My wife made it to our celebratory dinner later, and she apologized, but the mood was sour. The incident with Jake was serious, but not a life threatening emergency, and he has been admitted into treatment. 

My wife gave me the cold shoulder later saying how we should have been on the same page, been there for support, and that I'd been selfish. I disagreed, saying she'd been selfish in this scenario, and she tainted Jess' moment. This went on for a while, and I ended up sleeping on the couch. 

I still feel I made the right decision, but I know I hurt my wife, and Jake's recovery is obviously of paramount importance as well.

1d8acpx,AITA for reminding my friend that she married for intelligence and look where it got her?,"I (35F) met my husband Vince (36M) after he saved me from drowning at a pool party when I was 18. I took him out for lunch the following week to thank him for saving me, and we soon fell in love and began dating. 

At the time, Vince worked a blue collar job while I was studying in university. We ended up getting married and Vince supported me throughout my entire education up until I got my PhD. 

Vince always told me that he wanted to study in university but had learning disabilities that made it difficult for him to study in a classroom. At times he was embarrassed by the fact that he had to work twice as hard compared to people around him, but I always found that to be admirable about him. 

When I finished my studies and got a well paying job I convinced Vince to give his dream of studying another go. 

Last year he was finally accepted into a nursing program at our local university. He is working hard to achieve him dream and I’m incredibly proud of him.

Last week my friend Alba (36F) came to visit with her son so our children could play together. Alba was my roommate during my first year in university, she began dating her husband Leo around the same time I started dating Vince. 

Leo was an obnoxious law student who later on became an even more obnoxious attorney. He was a know it all who prided himself on his intelligence, which for some reason attracted Alba. 

At the time Alba would sometimes tease me that I could do better than Vince, and would offer to set me up with one of Leo’s law school buddies, but I would always refuse and she eventually dropped the subject. 

Alba and Leo are currently going through a nasty divorce that stems from him cheating on her, quite frankly he is dragging her through the mud and is using connections to try and leave her as penniless as possible. 

As we were chatting and catching up Alba began to express concern over the fact that my eldest son (7M) was recently diagnosed with dyslexia, Alba began telling me how she is worried that my son will be academically challenged like his father and what that could entail for his future. Before I could respond she told me how I should have married someone smart while I had the chance so I would have kids like hers. (Albas son is an incredibly bright boy and a straight A student).

I told Alba her advice was unnecessary and reminded her where marrying for intelligence got her, I then proceeded to tell her that I would rather have my son grow up to be an honest, hardworking person like his father than an academically gifted jerk who wasn’t smart enough to know sleeping with his secretary could have consequences on his marriage like her husband. 

Alba was deeply hurt by what I’ve said and stormed out with her son. Some mutual friends are now chiming in and are telling me that
I was too harsh on Alba for using her failing marriage to prove my point and should apologize. ",Throw_awayy098,11411,1018,0.949999988079071,0.7066235171962219,1717540642,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1d8acpx/aita_for_reminding_my_friend_that_she_married_for/,2024,6,AmItheAsshole,2024-06-04 22:37:22
1dc607o,AITA for being rude to my stepdaughter and banning her from eating with the family,"I have 2 stepdaughters, Scarlett (18), and Ava (16). 

Scarlett is an amazing singer. She's been in some kind of voice lessons since she was 10 and just graduated from one of the best performing arts schools in the state, where she went on a full scholarship since 6th grade. She has a YouTube channel where she sings that she's starting to make money from and was accepted into some very prestigious music schools. Additionally, she has been working paid gigs for the last 2 years and makes at least $500-1000 per week, more in the summers. She's even been the opening artist at a few concerts. I'm not trying to brag, I'm just saying she's an objectively good singer. 

Ava, on the other hand, is not a good singer. She likes to believe she is and she might become one if she actually stuck with voice lessons or choir classes but she always quits after 1-2 weeks because they're ""bullying her"" (giving constructive feedback, I've seen the notes her classmates and teachers have given her). 

Ava also likes to sing very loudly and/or at bad times. For example, if she feels that we're too quiet at the dinner table she starts to loudly sing. It doesn't sound good and I honestly don't know how she doesn't hear it. If you ask her to stop she keeps going and if you're blunt and say stop, that doesn't sound good/we don't want to hear it she keeps going and gets even louder just to annoy you. 

If we're in the car and we don't let her choose the songs she'll loudly sing whatever she wants, not what's playing, to annoy us and responds the same way to us telling her to stop. The only person she listens to is her dad. 

A few weeks ago we were trying to eat and she was singing again. I told her to stop and she refused so I took her plate and told her from now on she is no longer allowed to eat at my table. She can eat in her room, the backyard, her car, the garage, wherever she wants as long as we can't hear her from the dining room and that this will continue until she can behave appropriately at the table. 

My husband and I argued about it but he's not home for dinner so there isn't much he can do about it. Today she was eating lunch with us and started singing again. I told her to stop and she didn't listen so I again took her plate and told her to eat somewhere where we can't hear her if she doesn't want to act appropriately. Ava argued that she's a better singer than Scarlett and that Scarlett sings all the time. I was done with her bullshit so I asked her how many times someone other than her dad has actually asked her to sing, not even paying her to be there, just ask her to sing or how many performing arts schools she's gotten accepted to (she's applied to many).

She started to cry and my husband wants me to apologize for being rude to her and is insisting I allow her to eat with the family again.

1dsdhlx,AITA for not paying for my daughter's college housing and campus fees next year because she misled me about her summer classes?,"My (55M) daughter (19F) is taking three online summer classes this summer. Back in April, she told me that all her classes would be in-person, so I paid for her summer housing and meal plan so she could live on campus. I didn't think much of it at the time because I trusted her. Two of them are general education classes (English and physics), and one is a major-specific class, so I figured that she would want to get her generation requirements out of the way and I'm sure the major-specific class is important for her major.

However, I just found out that her classes are actually all online. There is a 3rd-party website that has information about classes each semester at her college, and I was just scrolling through it out of curiosity and happened to see her classes are all online, with no in-person component. I was very shocked about how I was misled for the last 2 or 3 months. I know that she really likes campus life, but things do tend to tone down over the summer, and she probably is aware of the campus housing fees and whatnot. This means I spent a good amount of money for housing and meal plans that she didn't actually need. I'm paying for her education out of her college savings, which we've been saving for many years, and I want to teach her the value of money and the importance of honesty.

I was on the phone with her, and I told her I decided that I'm not paying for her housing or any of her campus fees next year. I emphasized that she needs to understand that there are consequences to her actions. However, she is really upset and says that I'm being too harsh. She says that in April the classes were listed as in-person but they moved it to virtual at the very last minute, after the deadline for housing withdrawal and refund stuff. I don't know if this is actually true since I never bothered to check the class listings at that time and I didn't see a reason she would lie about it. I told her I'm very skeptical that they would move all classes to online at the very last minute because it would certainly disrupt some people's plans (especially those who lease off-campus). My wife said that what I told her was way too harsh, and that unexpected things do happen.

So AITA for not paying for my daughter's college housing and campus fees next year because she misled me about her summer classes?",RangerRemarkable3,3468,2128,0.8700000047683716,0.5855977138385793,1719786753,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dsdhlx/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_daughters_college/,2024,6,AmItheAsshole,2024-06-30 22:32:33
1drm1oo,AITA for not attending my best friend's wedding?,"My friend [27/f] asked me [28/f] to be one of her bridesmaids for her wedding. She was my maid of honor two years ago, and before that, we'd always say we'd be each other's maid of honor (we've been friends for 20 years). When she asked me to be a bridesmaid, it stung a bit, to be honest, but seeing as she has a twin sister that she is close to, it made sense that she should be her maid of honor.

The issue I really had with this is that at one point, before I did barely anything as a bridesmaid, she told me, ""You don't have to stand with the other bridesmaid's during the wedding.""  I found it weird that she was saying that, but I replied, ""no, I want to be there with all of you"". After a bit of back and forth, she admitted she doesn't want me standing there with everyone because of my fear of being the center of attention and my social anxiety.

She was worried that I would have a panic attack just like I did standing there at my own wedding. Honestly, it was bad during my wedding because I was shaking and couldn't breathe, and everyone's terrified reaction made it even worse for me. I had to leave and come back to just me, my husband, and my mother to continue our vows and such while everyone else moved on to the reception. I couldn't even go join them until I was drunk enough to not feel embarrassed.

I've been to therapy since then and have made huge progress regarding my social anxiety and my best friend knows this. I felt hurt that she didn't trust me enough to let me stand with the others. I told her I was so much calmer and less anxious now, and I won't even be the center of attention like I was when I was the bride. She said she acknowledged my improvement but just doesn't want to take chances.

She said she doesn't want to embarrass me again and that she would just feel worried about me the whole time, and was also worried that I would ruin the mood of the wedding if I did happen to have a panic attack. I eventually told her that I'd just rather be a guest if I can't do all the bridesmaid stuff. On the day of her wedding, I was just so sick to my stomach with hurt and sadness that I was merely going as a guest to her wedding that I just decided not to go because I felt so left out.

Now she is very mad at me for making her feel bad at her wedding. She thinks I was trying to hurt her and make her feel guilty because of what she thinks was a reasonable request. I didn't mean to hurt her but I just couldn't go because I was overwhelmed with hurt. The people I've talked to are all divided on who is the asshole in this situation. I feel bad for ruining her mood on her wedding day but I still feel what she asked of me was hurtful.

1dfcvs2,AITA for refusing to accept my mom’s friend’s MacBook after her autistic son broke mine and asking her to buy me a new one?,"I (16F) got a brand new MacBook Pro for my birthday last month. My family isn’t rich and I don’t usually get gifts like that. My parents said they got me that because I’ve been doing great at school and they thought I deserved something nice after using an old Chromebook for years. 

A few days ago, my mom’s friend came over with her kids (14F and 10M). We were in my room and me and the girl were sitting on my bed talking while the boy was on the floor playing with some Legos (he is autistic). He walked over to my desk, opened my laptop, and told me to give him the password so he could play Roblox. I told him he can’t play on my computer and he started crying and saying it’s not fair and he’s bored. I told him to go get his mom’s phone if he’s bored and he said he wants to play on my laptop. When I said no again, he threw it on the floor and stomped on it.

I went outside and told my mom. His mom apologized and said she would pay for the repairs. I told her that I don’t think it’s repairable because it’s completely smashed. He threw it open with the screen facing down. The thing that connects the screen to the keyboard snapped, the screen was filled with cracks, and it was dented all over. We took it to a repair shop and they told us that it can’t be fixed and we should just buy a new one instead.

My mom called her friend and told her that. She came over with her MacBook and said I could have that instead. I told her that I don’t want her 5 year old MacBook Air, I want her to give me $1800. My mom is on my side and she is going to give us the money, but she’s not happy about it. She said she was planning to buy her daughter a laptop because she’s going to high school and her son a PS5 for his birthday and she won’t be able to do that because I was greedy. I don’t care that her brat isn’t getting a PS5 but I kinda feel bad for her daughter because this wasn’t her fault. She’s been telling all of her and my mom’s other friends that I’m a spoiled brat and this wouldn’t  have happened if I’d let her precious baby boy play Roblox or given him my phone.

1dcybn6,AITA for inviting my mom to stay at our house when my wife hates her? ,"My wife(43F) hates my mom(67F) and visa versa mainly because my mom criticizes her for being a bad wife. My wife is a OBGYN and so I do most of the housework. I am a senior data analyst and work from home 3 days a week so I get the kids ready for school while my wife heads to the gym. As soon as we had kids my mom began critiquing my wife’s “laziness”. My wife working 60-70h a week and I work 40h and we can’t have the lifestyle we do without her income which I have explained repeatedly to my mom. But my mom is pretty old fashioned and conservative on these things and thinks my wife is being a bad wife because I spend more time with the kids and do more of the housework. She is very critical and I understand why my wife had enough even though I repeatedly told my mom to keep her opinions to herself.

My wife blew up at her after she stayed over during the holidays and I was doing all the cooking and cleaning as I had time off and my wife still needed to work. My mom criticized her for being a bad mom for not being there during Christmas and my wife blew up at her and refused to let her stay over. It’s been 5 or 6 years and she is still banned from the house. She has apologized to my wife but my wife ignores any attempts at communication and I’ve given up on them getting along. If my mom wants to see our children I drive them over. This has caused a lot of issues in our marriage. 

She recently had a heart attack which required a stent put in. She was released from the hospital and asked me to stay at our house for a week. She lives alone and I wanted to be there to watch her and agreed without thinking. I asked my wife who refused to let me mom stay saying she is going to driving her back to her home the instant I bring her over. She had a heart attack and I wished my wife would show some sympathy but she also caused the problems between her and my wife so AITA for wanting my mom to stay at our house after surgery to recover?

1daplsa,AITA for hiding my large net worth from my boyfriend of 8 years while he paid for everything?,"Throwaway account.

I (34F) was recently engaged to my boyfriend (37M) of eight years. We've been living together for quite some time, yet we've always kept our finances almost entirely separate. When it came to discussing being married, the idea of a prenup came up. It was then that I came clean about my financial status. My net worth is just barely seven figures, yet he's been the one ""supporting"" the household.

Background: We met months after I returned to my hometown. My father had unexpectedly died, and I'd left a lucrative engineering career (six figures) that had started fresh out of college. Before that career hit, I had been raised to be frugal as hell, and I suffered like crazy through college. No home internet, no phone, no car, working multiple part-time jobs while being a full time student, etc. When money suddenly starting coming in, my lifestyle didn't change THAT much. Being able to afford a dozen more food options and having a $500 car felt like moving up in the world.

So when we met, I had '97 car, a crappy one-bedroom apartment, never went out to eat (including fast food), and was working a minimum wage job. I got the job for the sake of insurance, and I had wanted something extremely flexible in lieu of my father's death. So I imagine I came across as someone living paycheck to paycheck, when I really had quite a chunk of change in the bank.

As our relationship progressed, we found we had very different styles of living. He liked going out, and I disputed this. We always split the bill down the middle, and I was getting cranky - these outings were his suggestions, and my date ideas were free/cheap. He said he'd pay for both us. Move forward: We moved in together, and I again I disputed. We didn't NEED to rent a large house. It was ultimately decided to get his choice and I'd pay a smaller portion.

Then my mother died. The savings of my frugal parents went to me.

My boyfriend knew I didn't like spending money, and he knew I wasn't in debt. But he still thought his worth was higher, and he was still paying for most of the expenses. 

To clarify: He'd worked up to a six figure job, and I feel he should spend his income as he wants. He spends at will, retains little savings, but he's stayed debt free.

Fast forward. We're engaged, and I tell him how much money I have. He's initially excited at the prospect of being able to buy all these things. I'm scared. My finances will suddenly become ""our"" finances, and his spending ideas are NOT what I want. We discuss this, and now he's mad that he's been mostly supporting me for so long, unnecessarily. I point out that was the lifestyle HE chose, and that he absolutely refused MY suggestions. Still, I benefited.

I say we can use my savings to buy a house, to have solid funds for future children, for earlier retirement, etc. He's growing more resentful.

My net worth was a lie of omission. I never told him I couldn't afford things.

AITA for keeping this hidden for so long?",Away-Refuse-5123,1801,1396,0.800000011920929,0.3634288083677526,1717804698,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1daplsa/aita_for_hiding_my_large_net_worth_from_my/,2024,6,AmItheAsshole,2024-06-07 23:58:18
1diame9,AITA for not putting my MIL’s Maiden name in my child’s name. ,"My fiancé (24m) and I (24f) are expecting our first child in December of this year. We don’t know the gender yet so we were picking names for both a boy and a girl. We’ve fallen in love with names already. My fiancé has his father’s last name, and that name is on his birth certificate. While his mother has a completely different last name. She has been hellbent on getting us to make the last name of our child her maiden name which neither of us have. So in my head it just doesn’t make sense. She has been very manipulative in the past with various things to the point where we have given in to just get her to leave us alone about things. This time around she proceeded to guilt trip us on why we won’t give the child her last name. She proceeded to throw the “I raised you he didn’t” card and even said she was going to go to the court to change my fiancés last name which I found hilarious seeing he’s a grown adult. Now mind you MIL has 4 sons, two of which have her maiden name as her last name and all four children are straight and have potential to bare children of their own in the future. Im trying to convince my fiancé not to give in to even hyphenating her last name and keeping it just his current last name to help set early boundaries on raising this child. But MIL has it so deep in his mind that he has to please her and that she’s entitled to make these decisions because she raised him. Not to mention she had demanded to be at my gender ultrasound instead of waiting for the reveal we have planned at our baby shower. So I’m just curious if ITA because I want our child to have his or her father’s last name and not their grandmothers. 

UPDATE: My fiancé and I have talked and we have agreed to give the baby his last name as I will be marrying him and taking the last name anyway. Boundaries will be HEAVILY set with MIL and appointments will be kept private between the two of us. I thank all of you who have validated my feelings and who have given advice as this all has helped make us realize and make him realize that this is a creepy power control thing on her end. We only want the best for baby and we need to lay the law now or it will never happen.

1drmdgb,AITA for telling my friend that she is making her fiancé miserable.,"I (21F) recently got into a pretty heated argument with my friend (22F) regarding her engagement to her fiancé (30M). 
For some background info, me and my friend (Carrie) have been on and off friends since middle school, but over the last 3 years, have become really close and I would consider her a best friend. I love her, but she is definitely one to be dramatic and overreactive. I’ve always thought that, but it has been overwhelmingly hard to handle for the past year. 
About a year into her relationship with her fiancé (Shawn) she started to obsess over the idea of getting engaged. She would constantly ask friends and family if Shawn had mentioned wanting to propose, would go through his bags during every trip they took to see if he had a ring hidden somewhere, and would sob to Shawn and anyone who would listen after any major holiday or event, wondering why he wouldn’t propose because it was the “perfect opportunity”. 
During a night out with Shawn, Carrie, and one of his friends, Carrie texted me begging for me to talk to Shawn privately about when he was going to propose. Knowing she wouldn’t drop it, I texted Shawn and said at some point that night, I would need to talk to him. Eventually, I got him alone and explained that he didn’t need to tell me anything, but that Carrie wanted me to ask about thoughts on engagement. He told me that he’s gotten to the point where he is going to propose to make her happy and that it will be about two months from when our convo took place.
 Now, they are engaged, but the issues have not gone away. Now Carrie is obsessed with wedding planning and Shawn has shared with me that he feels overwhelmed by her even more so now. Shawn isn’t allowed to go out for drinks once a week after work or play videos games like he usually does because of the wedding. 
Yesterday, I was over at their shared place because Shawn was golfing and Carrie didn’t want to be alone. At one point, she looked at his location, then pulled up a map of the golf course online and asked me to help her figure out what hole he was on. I told her it looked like he was on hole eight, which upset her because he had already been golfing for awhile and she assumed he would be close to done. She proceeded to call him 32 times in a row until he answered, and then sobbed when he picked up and told him he needed to come home now, because he had been out for too long. After their argument over the phone, I couldn’t stop myself from the comment I made which was: don’t you think you’re making Shawn a little miserable? 
This obviously didn’t go over well, she sobbed and yelled at me, saying I just didn’t understand how much she loves him. 
I left and we haven’t talked in a couple days. I regret what I said, but I don’t necessarily think I’m wrong. My overall concern is that I have definitely become too involved in their relationship, I have definitely become the middle man.
So, AITA for telling my friend that she is making her fiancé miserable.",ForeverCompetitive12,4565,779,0.9700000286102296,0.3584913073957088,1719698957,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1drmdgb/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_she_is_making_her/,2024,6,AmItheAsshole,2024-06-29 22:09:17
1dhishx,AITA for messing with in-laws when they pretended my vacation house was theirs?,"I (45M) bought land out west for a future vacation house years ago.  When my now-wife (37F) and I were engaged, I finally got around to having it built.  I paid for it myself and it is my name only (wife’s fine with this).  My MIL has always been a bit weird about it. She grew up in a family that had a “compound” (long gone) and when I started building she was excited about how “we would have a family compound again.”  It was odd, but I let it slide.  She and my FIL also would often more “tell” my wife (not me) that they would be staying there on certain dates, rather than asking.  We usually don’t have people stay there without us – if we wanted that, well, houses in the area Airbnb for $10K/wk. 

Recently they were staying there for a week.  We have a homewatch guy who comes after we leave to make sure water’s off, it’s all locked up, etc, and checks periodically when vacant. He showed up 2 days after ILs were to have left  and called us to say he found a couple there who said they were visiting the owners (whom they identified as ILs) and had asked to stay on four days after they left.  My wife recognized the name (“the Smiths”) as friends of her parents, nice people, and this wasn’t their fault, so we called them and told them the situation but let them stay the extra days.

Here’s where I might be the AH.  I decided to mess with the ILs.  I called them and that well-pump system had thrown an error code (said (our house is very internet-connected so it can be managed from afar).  Could one of them go to pipe room and FaceTime me so I could walk them through reset?  My MIL stammered and said that they had gone to town for the day and couldn’t; and that water seemed fine that morning so could we just have a tech come in a few days?  I said its hard to get techs out there and the caretaker is away, but I could wait ‘til they get back in the evening.  I also said, it’s weird that you’re in town, but I am getting alerts that the garage door has been opened and closed several times during the day – maybe I should have a neighbor check it out?   “No, don’t, we’ll be back!” I then told “the Smiths” that my ILs were banned and if they showed up they should have them call me to explain.  The ILs drove 4 hours to get back to the house to cover up what had gone on.  They called us and I told them that we knew they had been representing the house as their own, giving it to their friends and they were banned.  They protested that they’d have to get a hotel or drive 4 hours back, and I said I didn’t give a shit, so long as they got off my property immediately. They whined about how they had made plans later in the summer.  I told them they could tell whatever friends they had lied to about having a vacation place the truth or some other outlandish lie, but they weren’t coming.   My wife then posted on social media (where she is connected with many of ILs friends) that the house is mine and any invitations extended were not authorized.  ILs called us jerks.",PrizeNegotiation5637,5006,305,0.9700000286102296,0.2811217927726741,1718576040,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dhishx/aita_for_messing_with_inlaws_when_they_pretended/,2024,6,AmItheAsshole,2024-06-16 22:14:00

The dress itself isn’t hideous, it’s just . . . unflattering. It’s a bright neon green, which wouldn't normally be a deal breaker, but it’s a halter top with a super low back.  Now, I’m all for embracing my body, but I have pretty bad scoliosis and a prominent scar on my back from a childhood surgery. The low back would definitely show off both, and I’m not comfortable with that.

I talked to Rainn about it, suggesting maybe a shawl or finding a dress with a higher back. She shut me down completely. She said the dresses are “non-negotiable” and that “it’s her day.” I understand wanting everything to look perfect for her wedding, but I don’t feel comfortable feeling so exposed on such a big day.

I floated the idea of just opting out of being a bridesmaid altogether. Rainn got really upset and said it would be a huge betrayal. Now I feel stuck. I don’t want to be a bad friend, but I also don’t want to wear a dress that makes me feel self-conscious.

1dc6enl,AITA for not taking back pajamas my bf’s girl best friend wore?,"The past weekend my bf and I joined his friends for a weekend getaway at a cabin (Airbnb). There were five people in total (me, him, a male friend, his gf, and my bf's girl best friend). 

I've never liked his girl best friend because she gives pick me vibes and I think she either has a crush on my bf or she likes attention. She doesn't like me either. I remain very cordial to her. 

When we arrived at the cabin, she told my bf that she hadn't packed any pajamas and none of her clothes were appropriate since they'd get dirty. 

She couldn't wear the other girl's clothes because they wouldn't fit so she begged my bf to give me my pajamas since I always pack extra. Without asking me he gave her my pajamas.

So I came out of the shower to find her wearing my pajamas and with the bottom basically shoved all way up her crack. She spent the entire weekend lounging in my pjs. 

When the weekend was over she tried to give them back to me and I said that she could keep them. She got mad at me and asked if I thought she was dirty or had cooties. I said she could just keep them since it seemed she liked them a lot. She called me a mean girl and said I was being rude.

It ruined the mood since the other friend took her side while his girlfriend took mine and my bf had to take my side. And now things are really awkward and I think I might be iced out by my bf's friends. AITA?

Edit: He did not know I do not like her. I was annoyed at him for not asking but I always pack extra and never fussed about lending clothes to other people because I believe in hospitality. I would have offered her the pajamas. He immediately apologized and even bought me new pajamas.

1dkoexw,AITA for asking my friend not to speak to me about a shared hobby after he found my “white whale?”,"I (31F) and my friend (30M) share a mutual hobby, comics. 

For context, he got into collecting them himself about four months ago after finding out just how intense I was about it. To be honest, it *is* the one thing we’ve really connected on, and while we do share other interests outside of this, nothing else really came close as far as quality time and mutual enjoyment goes. Traveling long distances just to look at Facebook marketplace posts, spending weekends hitting up yard sales, old book stores, flea markets, random shops, etc.

There’s a very specific run that I’ve been obsessed with since I was a kid, and one issue left that would complete my set that I’ve been working on for over 15 years now. I also have all of the figures, etc. that I know of that were released alongside it.

It’s the last thing I need and I’ve always been on the lookout for it - there are a couple available online, but priced above $5k, which I can’t afford. He knows all about this one as I rant and rave about it constantly. I have a tiny photo of it in a locket I wear as a joke, lol.

Last week, he found one in a shop for $2. He came up behind me, saw it before I did, and picked it up without saying anything. I didn’t realize what it was until he pulled it out of the bag later in the car, and showed me, saying how cool it was he found it so cheap and how he was going to get it graded and buy a case, etc.

If I said I was happy for him, I’d be lying. I’m so goddamn jealous, I cried about it for two days straight. I keep thinking things like, “If only I’d looked at the rack from top to bottom rather than bottom to top, I would have found it first.” TBH it makes me sick to think about, that I was so close and lost out to someone who, frankly, I feel like it isn’t as important to - Though now he says it’s going to be the start of his own collection for that run. “Now that I have this one, I may as well get the rest,” were his words.

I can fully admit I haven’t been able to let it go. He kept trying to talk to me about it, asking where I found all of mine, etc. I told him 
I understand he saw it first, bought it, and that he can do what he wants with it, but I was going to need time to get over my feelings - I just missed out on the object to my obsession to someone I myself introduced to the hobby, who previously didn’t particularly care for that specific run.

I asked him not to talk to me about it, and said I didn’t feel like going out and hunting with him for a while. He emphasized that now we can focus on finding myself one, but that’s the first I’ve seen outside of a glass case in nearly two decades. Plus, I just don’t want to go with him specifically, at least until I feel better.

He says I’m putting a strain on our friendship and sabotaging my own weekends (I’m refusing to go out and look for comics - I feel unmotivated) because I can’t be an adult about the situation. I feel like what he did wasn’t “wrong” but that I have a right to distance myself and handle my feelings if I need to.

1dcycsz,AITA for taking a picture of a stranger and their dog in a restaurant,"Throwaway and this just happened.  

I went to a chipotle style restaurant thats local to my area.  I ordered my food, got it, and was going to leave when I noticed a couple that had a dog with them.  It just wasn't with them, it was on the furniture.  This shit annoys me, its indoors at a restaurant which isn't allowed. While I'm not allergic, but my mom and brother have severe pet allergies.  

So I took a picture.  I didn't say anything to them, I just took the picture.    I wanted to submit a health code violation to my county and use the picture as proof.  I wasn't going to use it for any other purpose than to submit and document a violation.  

They noticed me and asked why I was taking their picture. I told them.  They said they didn't want their picture used for that.  I told them they should have thought about that before .  They asked me to delete the picture.  I refused.  They called me an asshole.  I go to leave and one of them follows me out and says I violated their privacy. I told them I don't care,  I got in my Truck and left.  AITA?",NoDogsInRestaurants,1830,708,0.8399999737739563,0.2244034290709087,1718057975,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dcycsz/aita_for_taking_a_picture_of_a_stranger_and_their/,2024,6,AmItheAsshole,2024-06-10 22:19:35

1dsed83,AITA for telling my guy friends that a girl can reject someone publicly,"Firstly Good day to you i hope ur having a great day/night anyways,

Recently at my school a girl got one of those promposals with the flower and the cardboard and everything and there was quite a crowd it was cite at first but the said SORRY BUT NO and she was super polite about it and as expected people started laughing and chattering and going OHHHH OMGGG stuff like that a huge debate broke out because of this especially with some of my guy friends.

They were blaming her saying after everything he did to plan it she just embarrassed him like that she should’ve said yes and if she wanted to say no so bad she should’ve said it in private… WHAT?

Now this is what i said and some of my guy friends and most if not all my girlfriends agreed with me but some of my guy friends went as far as to say i lacked empathy 
I said if ur going to propose in public be ready to get rejected in public 
I thought it was common sense that you only propose in public if ur sure she’s gonna say yes (i’m talking about like hoco and proms) 
If it’s a crush then it should be in private in case she says no so you can save yourself from embarrassment but some guys were acting like she it’s her duty to save his ass from embarrassment and she was just being rude because she thinks she’s pretty because someone asked her out 

And some guys were saying she should’ve have said yes because of his effort that it’s the thought that counts like so if i say no to someone because i have other plans or i just am mot interested im the person i’m an ahole?

And their acting like he slayed dragons to get flowers to propose to her i could easily get roses and make a cute cardboard and gather my friends to help me if i wanted to make a public proposal but i’m not gonna be like: 

“omgosh i can’t believe u said no even after i colored some cardboard for you how ungrateful”

Am i being rational or do i truly just lack empathy☹️",Iliterallyneedtealol,2549,509,0.9700000286102296,0.2152683754090966,1719789196,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dsed83/aita_for_telling_my_guy_friends_that_a_girl_can/,2024,6,AmItheAsshole,2024-06-30 23:13:16
1dgutxg,AITA for letting a gay man buy me a cup of coffee?,"So earlier today I (19m) was hanging out with some friends of mine and we were downtown for the pride fair happening in my city. I broke off from my group and went to a nearby Cafe to get a cup of coffee. While I was waiting in line, a guy about my age came up to me and asked if he could pay for whatever I was getting.

I told him thanks but there's no need, and he kept insisting that I let him buy me a cup of coffee. I told him again there was really no need, but he didn't relent. I eventually accepted, much to his enthusiasm. We stood in line, he paid for my cup of coffee, and we talked for awhile while I waited for my drink. He eventually asked if he could get my number or if I'd be interested in exploring the rest of the fair together. I apologized and told him that I'm straight, and he got a bit annoyed. 

He scoffed and said ""you could have told me that before I bought you a coffee."" And then walked out of the Cafe.

Was I the asshole here? I kind of feel like it. I sort of figured he was interested in me when he first made the offer, but I didn't want to assume. I tried to politely turn him down, but he kept on insisting.

1dqvms5,AITA for not eating watermelons my (21m) sister (18f) keeps buying?,"My sister is a big fan of watermelons. In the summer she's been buying watermelons from the grocery store almost every week. She cuts the watermelon and serves it, and she's really into food preparation in general.

However, I'm not a big fan of watermelon. I don't really like the taste of it. When she offers it to me, I politely decline. She says she feels hurt when I don't eat the watermelon she buys and prepares, and she says I'm ungrateful and wasteful.

Our parents agree with her and say that I should just eat the watermelon to avoid wasting food and to support her efforts. I said that I feel pressured into eating the watermelon, and I said that I'm not a fan of watermelon that much. They still insisted that I eat the watermelon, saying that food should not go to waste, I should support and appreciate my sister, and that it has nutritious value. I reiterated that I did not want to eat the watermelon because I do not like it. I pointed out that I like mango and my sister does not, so I asked if she would eat mango that I buy and prepare. She said that she would not because it's kind of sour and has a weird texture, whereas watermelon is the ideal summer fruit because it's sweet and juicy. After a 15 minute argument I still refused to eat the watermelon my sister is offering, and she and my parents became visibly upset.

1dc6dza,AITAH for not paying for my coworkers lunch? ,"This is genuinely the dumbest AITAH I’ve ever made/read, but here we are. I’m a first responder and was riding along with another shift for training purposes. The first day we drove through chic fil a. I ordered a small Mac And cheese, in our area that’s about $4. He ordered a whole meal. When we got to the window, they gave us 50% off making mine $2. The guy I was riding with said “Don’t worry I’ll cover you”. Cool, thank you for covering my $2 I appreciate it lol. Second day we went to a local bistro that’s decently pricey. I ordered a salad that was about $10. His meal totaled out to just over $20. When we went to the register to pay he told them “She’s going to cover mine” while pointing at me. To say I was appalled is an understatement. The cashier looked at me and I calmly stated “No, I will just be covering myself”. The guy I was riding with got mad and started saying he covered me for lunch yesterday so it’s only right that I cover him. I’m not confrontational, but I’m also no punk lol. I calmly stated “$2 does not constitute $22 (or whatever the total was). If you’d like me to give you $2 to cover my small side I ordered yesterday I will absolutely do that. But I will not be paying for your meal” and handed my card to the cashier. He paid for his meal and we went outside where he refused to let me get into the vehicle. He continued to argue and cause a scene in the parking lot. He told me I’m not longer allowed to ride with him, so I called for a supervisor. Once the supervisor arrived he told them that he covered my lunch yesterday and that I refused to extend the same courtesy and that I embarrassed him and caused a scene and he no longer feels comfortable riding with me. I explained my side to the supervisor and apologized because this is literally so ridiculous lol. The supervisor essentially said I was wrong because I should’ve just been respectful and paid for him like he did me. At this point I was pissed and told them this sounds like extortion and that I wasn’t going to be taken advantage of. I told them that $2 is a whole lot different than $22. We’re first responders, we don’t make a lot of money. I continued to say if he wanted me to buy him a drink from the gas station or give him $2 I had absolutely no problem doing so, but I was not going to be bullied into covering his meal because he covered mine. I ended up riding with someone else because obviously riding with him is no longer an option. The person I switched to also said I was wrong and should’ve just paid for his meal. I don’t think I’m wrong here. Had I known the previous day that I would be expected to pay for his expensive meal after paying for my $2 Mac and cheese I would’ve never let him cover me. I feel like since he put me on the spot, me putting him on the spot in return was only fair. I don’t feel like I caused a scene, I wasn’t the one who argued and refused to unlock the doors. But now everyone’s saying that I’m not a team player and I embarrassed him as well as our place of work. Am I wrong here? AITAH?

1ddq9xy,AITA for asking the teacher to tell the autistic kid to stop harassing my daughter?,"Tonight, my 8-year-old daughter was shaking, crying, and refusing to go to sleep because a boy in her class constantly keeps following her around at school during breaks/lunch. This has been going on for months, apparently, progressively getting worse. 

She has told the boy to stop, first softly, and then more assertively, until she was screaming at him to stop, while crying today. He ran to the teacher and told her that my daughter was being mean to him. The teacher had words with my daughter. Which leads us to tonight, when she broke down.

I spoke to the teacher. She tells me that they are aware of the boy's condition, and that he does not pick up social queues. The teacher is telling my daughter to be friends with him and tolerate him. 

My daughter just wants to be left alone.

From the boy's perspective, he probably doesn't think he has done anything wrong. He probably just wants a friend to hang with. I feel for him.

However, in my probably biassed opinion, my 8-year-old daughter should not have to bear the burden of a boy who makes her uncomfortable, constantly following her around.

1dm8tul,AITA for pulling out of my sister’s wedding a year before the event and being mad that she won’t talk to me now,"I (28F), was asked by my (25F) sister to be the MOH for her wedding that was between a year and a half to 2 years out.

Six months ago, I found out that I am pregnant. My husband and I hadn’t really been actively trying but we weren’t using protection because I’ve been told since I was in my teens that I was unlikely to be able to get pregnant, naturally. We are over joyed and our families are, as well! …except for my sister.

A few weeks following my pregnancy announcement, my mom and sister had a conversation about being realistic on if I would be able to take on all the duties of being her MOH while pregnant and later with an infant. My sister later spoke with me and told me that if I could not follow through with the duties of being her MOH - it was okay! They could find something else for me to be involved in, with the wedding. (For context, my sister and FBILs wedding party is so big that they have two best men and two MOHs) I discussed it with my family and husband…but I ultimately decided that it wasn’t fair to my sister or my child to make a promise to fulfill those duties when I would have a 3-4 month old infant and was generally unsure if I could do everything she needed of me. 

The wedding is two towns away, 30+ minutes drive, and I would either have to bring the baby with me for the day of the wedding (What bride and bridesmaids want to listen to a baby all day while they are getting ready?) or I would have to leave the baby with someone else (From around 8am that morning to somewhere between 6-8pm that night)

So I ultimately pulled out of the wedding party, about 12 months before the date. And intend to help with other things.

The problem is…despite my sister giving me the out and me taking the out….she will not speak to me. She hasn’t spoken to me or answered my calls in about 6 months. She showed up to my gender reveal and completely ignored me. She ignores me at family dinners, outtings, etc. My entire family has told her she is in the wrong and needs to get over it…but I understand that it’s her special day. 

But now I’m angry too…because I know that once I have this baby she is going to try to come into my home and act like everything is fine. And I will not allowed that to happen. I have had a difficult pregnancy so far…full of complications and sickness…my sister has been my best friend for years, she was the first person I called when I found out. And she was the one that gave me an out, in the first place.

I needed her too…


Edit: 
- To clear up some confusion, I am still planning on being involved in the wedding to some capacity and attending. Just not as the MOH
- Also, it should be known that this is a CHILD FREE wedding. I did not mention that prior, however I realize now how important that minor detail actually is to you guys.
- She came to ME about stepping away from the MOH position, not the other way round. I still offered to assist in what I can. Her expectations on what she expects from her MOH is beyond just standing beside her on her wedding day. If it were that simple, there probably wouldn’t even be an issue.

1d5xcky,AITA for not allowing my brother to bring a random Grindr hook up as his +1 at my wedding ?,"I (27F) am gonna get married to my fiance (29M) in July. Initially I invited both my brother (23M) and his long term girlfriend of 3 years to our wedding, however my brother broke up with her last month and a couple of days ago he requested me to let him bring another 1+ to my wedding in order to replace his ex that wasn't coming anymore.

I asked him who he was planning to bring and he said that he wanted to bring a guy he met recenly on Grindr with whom he got along great. I told him that I don't want him to bring a random hook up to my wedding cause we're planning for a rather small ceremony with only our families and close friends. The reason I invited my brother's ex was cause she was a long term girlfriend, which obviously isn't the case with this hook up. 

However my brother twisted the truth and started accusing us of being homophobic for previously allowing him to bring a woman as his plus 1 but not a man and even contacted some of my and my fiance's friends that are LGTBQ+ to stir up drama and turn them against us. While some of them believed us we've also had a couple of friends saying they're gonna drop out from our wedding cause of what my brother told them, not to mention that now he started stirring up drama with my family as well.

AITA ? I feel like I was reasonable in a valuing a long term girlfriend and a random hook from Grindr differently, especially when I still wouldn't have allowed my brother to bring a hook up to my wedding even if it was a woman instead, however I'm getting tired of getting called a homofob bridezilla over this decision ?

1drnora,AITA for ruining our family trip over matching outfits?,"**tl;dr** - I think my SILs intentionally left me out of matching family outfits on our trip & got upset; they said it was all in my head. AITA?

I just got back from our annual family trip & created this account to figure out if I am the A\*\*\* because I can't tell anymore.

My husband and I have been together for 15 years, and his family has a history of excluding me and our second kid from events. This year, we went on a 6-day cruise. A neighbor/friend booked the same cruise last minute. I made sure both my SILs knew they were coming.

One SIL (Jane) loves matching outfits, so we picked out swimsuits for the kids and an outfit for the kids to take photos in. I asked if adults were matching and was told no. On the first day, both Jane & my other SIL (Cindy) showed up in matching dresses with their husbands in almost identical outfits. They shrugged it off and said they just forgot to tell me.

The next day was my kid's birthday. At breakfast, my SILs disappeared with our kids and my friend’s kid without a word. When they returned, they dismissed my concerns and left again to eat lunch without us. We joined them later, but it was clear we were not included in their plans. They showed up for our dinner plans in matching outfits again and, again, we did not get the memo.

By the third day, everyone, including my friend, was in coordinated outfits except my family. When I confronted my SILs, they denied everything and blamed me for overthinking and moving to slowly. They said I made everyone miserable and that I was aggressive for expressing my hurt feelings.

The rest of the trip was awkward. I felt excluded and hurt, and now I fear there will be fallout with my MIL and the whole family.

1dgt4mo,AITA for telling my son it's a good thing he's pretty? ,"My wife and I have four kids. The first two are a welder and a doctor. My middle son just graduated with a degree in Dance. Our youngest is studying  engineering. 

My son is still living at home trying to figure out his future. We were talking about it and he said he wants to move out so he can live how he wants instead of by my insane rules. 

Those rules are 1. Be self supporting after you graduate. 2. Help with chores as long as you live at home. 3. Don't have sex I can hear. 

Those are too much for him. He went to my wife and said that he wanted some help so he could move out. She backed my rules. She also expects him to get a job, help around the house, and not expose us to the orgasms of his partners. Or his own for that matter. 

He came back to me asking how I expected him to make a living. 

We had both talked to him about getting a degree that had more prospects and maybe doing a minor in dance. Our daughter who is a doctor did her undergrad in music. But she also took premed classes and rocked her MCAT. 

He says that he didn't want to do that. He wants me to tell him what to do. I am just kind of lost. So I told him it's a good thing he's pretty. 

All I meant is that he is a tall, athletic, handsome young man. With a degree. He can find an entry level position and work his way up. Many successful people have. 

He took it to mean that I thought he should marry well and be a kept man. 

His other mom and him are pissed at me for undervaluing his potential. I think I was being realistic.

My sis-in-law and her husband looked after my 7 year old overnight for the first time a few weeks ago. My son was excited leading up to it as he was going to spend the night staying at ""his favourite uncles house"". The next day my sis-in-law was telling us how funny it was when they made the uncle hide and pretended he'd left for the night. My son took it as a joke for a while and kept saying ""haha no he hasn't"" but they kept it up until ""he had a mini meltdown"" and started crying. They (this was the second sis-in-law who was present) also did this by hiding his Nintendo Switch and pretended they sold it. My sis-in-law was laughing her head off while sat there just looking a bit confused/suprised at what was funny. SIL said something along the lines of ""you don't have to look so traumatised!"" And, knowing how sensitive my wife's side of the family can be, I just replied ""sorry, but I don't find those kind of jokes funny"". SIL then exploded in front of everyone and went on a rant about how she doesn't feel like she can treat my son how she wants and doesn't tell him off how she wants because of me. For context when my son was born he was very premature and in intensive care for the first three weeks so for the first year I absolutely was a bit overprotective and I also got my sis in laws back up when my son fell over when he was three and screamed and I went running over asking if he was ok, even though his other aunt was already there and that one exploded then too shouting that ""she knows how to look after a child!"". Again then I was a bit confused that asking my son who was crying and distressed if he was ok should get such an angry reaction. I'm now paranoid about how I parent in front on my in-laws. So, am I the asshole? Maybe I'm missing something and should see their pov?

Update:
Thanks everyone, I just wanted to check I wasn’t overreacting or losing the plot.

1d8bd5y,"AITA for refusing to give my brother ""his share"" of the education fund?","I (19F) go to university and major in accounting, my brother is 23 and just recently enrolled in community college for a skilled trades program. I was always disciplined and worked hard to ensure I had good grades and got into a good university. Meanwhile. my brother dropped out at 17 and sat at home to play video games all day. He just recently got his high school diploma from an online school and applied for trade school.

From the ages of 19-22, my brother worked a full-time job and another part-time job on the weekends, he would always flaunt his savings account in front of me. No shit, he had no bills to pay and is cheap as hell. The last time he flaunted his savings account, he had well over $60,000. 

Now since he dropped out of high school and showed no signs of pursuing higher education, my parents transferred his education fund over to me ($25,000). I also got qualified for low interest student loans, grants, and tuition so I kept that money in the fund and have all of it still. 

Now that my brother applied to community college, he's asking me for ""his"" money back. I told him no, and that I'm not going to subsidize his mistake. I also reminded him of the many times he flaunted his savings account, and of course he cried poor. He's a big manipulator, so he edits his savings account and tried to fool me into thinking he lost all his money in some stupid investment scheme. I could see through this and told him that even if this was true, I'm not going to give him MY money. My parents are urging me to give him some money because he had them fooled.

1dhjlyc,AITA for wanting nothing to do w my sisters baby?,"Long story so my apologies. Basically my mother met my step father and he took me on as his own, they then went on to have my sister (A) a year later. My mum died and my step dad kept me as his daughter and then remarried (B) when my sister was 2.

B hated me as I wasn't my dads and look a lot like my mom and eventually talked my dad into kicking me out the house in my mid teens and I went to live w my dads sister and her wife before I went off to college. 10 years later I'm married and have two children, When I was pregnant with my first A was super excited to be an auntie and came to my baby shower and everything, however once my daughter was born she never visited, I offered to go to her, meet her halfway, go do something like coffee date or beach day or something but she was always busy. Same thing happened with my second daughter, A was a no show. We'd message all the time but when I invited her for birthdays or weekends she'd say she was coming then just not show up. Fast forward my children are 8 and 9 years old and have never met their aunt, they don't actually know anything about her, no how are you texts for about 5 years now as I stopped reaching out because she just kept blowing us off. My sister had her baby 4 months ago which I found out via Facebook. I didn't message her because I thought she didn't want anything to do with my kids why should I bother with hers?

I borrowed something from my dads sister and went to drop it off the other day while the kids were at school. My dad, A and B were there with A's baby. I tried to just leave but A cornered me about not congratulating her about the baby or asking how she was doing, and I said why would I you didn't do it for my kids? She blew up at me calling me selfish, I yelled back I don't make a habit of asking after strangers babies and that's what she was to me. My dad said that we were sisters and family is supposed to be there for each other. I'm ashamed to admit I did lose my temper with him and call him a cold hearted bastard and who was he to talk to me about family wearing his no.1 grandpa shirt when he had grandchildren he had never acknowledged?. Where I am probably the asshole is this all happened in my aunts' house and in front of A's baby who was sleeping at the time but still it's not ideal to be screaming in front of an infant. My aunt thinks I was in the right and it was a long time coming but her wife thinks I could've used this as an opportunity to reconnect as maybe now A is mature enough to be able to have a relationship with me and my kids.

1dek5u2,AITA for kicking my stepsister out of my birthday trip?,"I (19F) am the daughter of separated parents, and my father's new wife has a daughter, Sophie (18F).

Last year my friends and I, including my best friend, May (20F), Debby (20F), and another 4 girls, decided to go on a trip for  to celebrate my birthday.

My father called me to ask me to take Sophie with us, because she felt a little left out and i acepted it, even if me and her didint have a close relationship.

The trip was one of the best of my life, but I noticed that May was a little down. I asked what was wrong and she said she was fine, just a little tired, so I believed her.

When we returned home, we promised that the following year we would repeat the trip if possible.

But this year, when I started preparing everything, Debby came to talk to me and showed me prints from a group chat that i was not part, which had the exact date of the time we were on the trip, last year, where Sophie was talking bad about May and calling her names, like  ""Whale"", ""Fat bit\*\*"" and other cruel things.

(For context, May is a fat woman.)

I spoke to May and she confirmed that during the trip, Sophie was completely unpleasant to her, always commenting on her body and her personality, for no apparent reason. But she didn't say anything, so as not to ruin the vibe of the trip party, and to not create tension between me and my father's side of the family, and after the trip, she ended up forgeting about completly.

I went to my father's house, and told Sophie that I knew everything, and she turned pale when she saw the prints I had.

I basically kicked her out of the trip and told her I didn't want to see her again.

Now, the other girls in the group, apart from Debby and May, are saying that I was an asshole for kicking Sophie out for something so insignificant, and that if Sophie doesn't go, neither will they.

1d7hmmy,AITA for NOT taking all toiletries from a hotel bathroom?,"I know it sounds wild. It does to me too, but here me out.

I'm on a trip with my friends. One of them came to my room to take a bath. She remarked how I haven't used the complementary toiletries when I should, used them, & called to have them refreshed. I didn't think anything of it.

The day we were to leave, she was present while I packed & commented how I hadn't packed the toiletries. I said I never do because I don't need them & it doesn't feel right. That's it. Exact words. But she got really offended over it. Went on for minutes about how people like me ruin it for 'working class' people like her (we work the same job??). How it's our right, included in our bills, & snooty attitudes like the one I'd displayed make the world look down upon the ethical practice of taking toiletries. She couldn't believe I would choose to be a jerk who sides with big, profit making hotels instead of the little man. I thought she might be stressed about something else or may be I had somehow been insensitive with that remark. I let her be & didn't react.

When it was our time to check out from the second hotel, the same thing happened all over again. She's not a weird person. But she's so adamant & passionate about this, it's making me question things.

1deiw9i,AITA for refusing to watch my cousin's kids anymore after she let me live with her rent free?,"I have a job coming up in a different state, and I wanted to visit my family before I went, since it's far away. So temporarily, my cousin said she would let me stay with her rent free.

I've been living on the couch for a month, and probably will for another month, since my offer was pushed back. I had to pawn off a lot of my stuff, since there was no room for it, which I've mostly accepted, since it was short notice. I do wish I had at least my own space.

She's also been paying for my food, since I wasn't expecting it to be this long, and didn't save up enough before moving, so I didn't want to complain. I haven't been doing chores much either, since her kids are MESSY, and I don't want to clean up after them constantly.

Initially, I didn't mind watching her kids, or letting her use my car. But it feels like she's taking advantage of me now. I've even told her I don't want to watch her kids all the time. She's started treating my car as her own, and will even leave it somewhere if her boyfriend picks her up, leaving me stranded. She will also plan on me watching her kids when she leaves, without asking me.

Yesterday, she said she was taking her kids somewhere, so I thought I could finally have some time to myself, but surprise, I had to watch her youngest because she's ""too young to go."" I normally go to the gym, but now it always feels like I'm too busy with her kids to do anything I want to do, and when I force the issue, it's mainly just to visit people I've been putting off visiting because of her, and I don't feel like I have any time to myself. I understand it's like that for parents, but I'm not a parent. They aren't my kids.

So I told her this, and said I can't keep watching her kids anymore and that she needs to get her own. It's too much for me, and they aren't my responsibility.

She got mad at me and told me if I hate it so much, that I should move out. That she's doing me a favor, and that since she hasn't made me pay rent and bought my food for me.

I agreed on that, but noticed that watching her kids is basically a full time job at this point, with permanent overtime. My SIL says that I should help her for her letting me stay and that I should also be helping with the chores, because being a parent is exhausting. Her husband (my brother) seems to understand my frustration, but wants to stay out of it, which I understand.

AITA for refusing to watch her kids anymore?

Edit: I don't mind watching her kids sometimes, or even letting her use my car. What I do mind is doing it 24/7. My point about the gym is that I go to the gym 30 minutes to an hour a few times a week, and I don't even have time to do that. I've also let her stay at my place before, before she had kids, and didn't ask anything from her.

Edit: Being an on call babysitter 24/7 is not equivalent for meals and only a couch to sleep on. She's getting way more out of this deal than I am, and people are on here calling me a deadbeat and a leech.

Edit: I've also offered to pay her $500 after I get my job. I think that's more than fair for what I got out of it.

Edit: I want all new readers to realize that it is 12 hours of babysitting almost everyday. 24/7 is exaggerating. 12 hours daily, without notice usually, is not.",Human-Win9124,277,456,0.7599999904632568,0.1050993739110434,1718229811,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1deiw9i/aita_for_refusing_to_watch_my_cousins_kids/,2024,6,AmItheAsshole,2024-06-12 22:03:31
1d9367a,WIBTA For Missing My Cousin's Wedding because She Didn't Send Me My Own Invitation,"This is petty, to be honest, but I'll give some backstory, so maybe it will make a little more sense. 
So I (26F) have a large extended family, like 10 cousins, most of whom have multiple kids now large. Despite being one of the oldest (3rd), I'm still kind of treated like a child. I believe this is because my family has a habit of having kids pretty young (e.i., Lots of teen moms and even those who plan for children have had them in their early twenties) and I'm child-free. It irks me since I've always been pretty independent, and now that I'm approaching my late 20s and have been living on my own for nearly 6 years, you'd think I'd get a little respect as an adult. But apparently not.
So I live about 3 hours away from where the rest of my family does, and I have been planning for months to visit for the Pride Parade held there. I live in a big city and the one they do here is just too hectic, so I prefer to go to that one. 
Well, I messaged my mom today asking when she's free so I can figure out a good time to visit with her and my siblings. She tells me not to worry about seeing just them, that we'll be able to spend plenty of time together at Cousin's(F22) wedding on Saturday. Cue confusion. I didn't know Cousin was getting married this weekend, but I didn't get any kind of invitation. I tell her that, and she's also confused because there's no reason Cousin wouldn't have invited me. I tell her it's no big deal anyways because I already have plans for that day. 
Well, I guess she mentioned something to Aunt (Cousin's mom) because she messaged me a few hours ago to tell me that I WAS invited, that I was on my mom's invitation as ""and Kids"". I tell her that that's too bad, because I already have plans for that night and that if they had really wanted me to go, they should have sent me my own invitation. I am an adult and live 3 hours away, so, of course, my mom isn't going to think I'm included in her ""and Kids"" invitation. I wasn't going to change my plans on a dime because of their shortsightedness. 
Well, apparently, that makes me an asshole. I've been getting messages from family left and right telling me I should skip the parade, that Cousin's wedding is more important because it's a one-time thing, but they do the parade every year. I haven't prepared to go to a wedding at all and I'mnot very close to that part of the family (they are ultra  religious). I'm pretty sure Cousin, herself, doesn't even care if I'm there or not.

1djvqyq,AITA for refusing to give my boyfriends’ cat back to his mother after his death?,"My boyfriend (26) of 3 years died in November of 2023 after getting in a car accident. He left behind his 2 cats Gizmo and Shortcake which we love dearly. Gizmo is 8 and Shortcake is 2.

Before we met, my boyfriend adopted Gizmo while he still lived with his mother so they all lived together for around 5 years before they moved out and moved in with me into my apartment and then we adopted Shortcake together a year ago from a local shelter.

Before his death, his mother and I had a decent relationship and we got along fine. I think his death brought us together more and she supported me throughout my grief. She would take me out for coffee and made sure I was eating well and taking care of myself, and I would try to help her out as well. 

Just recently she reaches out to me on whatsapp to ask about Gizmo and if she could come over to my place to say hi to him because she hadn’t seen him in a while. I said sure and she came over for around an hour ,we chatted about stuff and then she left. Later that night she messaged to ask me if she could maybe take Gizmo back to her house as he reminds him so much of her son and having Gizmo back would make her feel a lot better.

I said to her that it wouldn’t be fair on Gizmo to disrupt his routine on top of everything that’s happened as Gizmo was pretty shaken by the loss and was slowly starting to come back out of his shell. 

Her tone takes a 180 and she demands that I give her back Gizmo as it’s “technically her cat” and that she’s known him longer than I have so she has “more of a right to him than I do”. I refuse and try to reason with her but Gizmo is fine where he is. She sends me in full capitals that “the grief of a mother is more than the grief of a girlfriend”. 

I genuinely considered giving Gizmo back to her after she said that but I love Gizmo with my whole heart and I don’t want to make this harder on him that what it has to be and anyone with a pet would relate to that. 

In the morning she asked me to reconsider my answer to which I say it’s still a no and she leaves me on read. She then blasts me on facebook calling me a “selfish” and I get a dozen messages on facebook from her family calling me the same but I am still standing firm on my decision. This whole situation has put major strain on my relationship with her and my boyfriend’s extended family. This is a side of her I’ve never seen before and I think it’s damaged our relationship to a point of no return which sucks as they were my support system during my boyfriend’s death. It hurts me to think what my boyfriend would’ve thought of this whole situation as him and his mother were super close as well. I don’t know what he would’ve wanted me to do but regardless Gizmo is staying with me.

Does this make me the asshole?",Every-Replacement506,830,335,0.9200000166893004,0.1046100167384159,1718835508,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1djvqyq/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_boyfriends_cat_back/,2024,6,AmItheAsshole,2024-06-19 22:18:28
1doikmj,AITA for telling my mom she wasn't perfect? ,"My mom was an absolute narcissist growing up. We had to have gendered interests (no Legos for me). I had to take extracurricular activities she liked (no drama club or band). I was grounded for not being allowed on the cheerleader teams, and she would call our friends fat or poor if they didn't meet her expectations. I was on a diet as a kid and not allowed to eat the same as my brother’s. 

My SIL (Kate ) mom (Debbie) was the opposite, allowing her kids to do what they wanted and have the interest just for them. Kate is a lovely, well-adjusted woman; her mother, whom I have met several times, is a kind soul. 

We had a graduation party for my youngest brother. Kate made us cupcakes, and they were delicious. My mom made a snide remark about wishing I could be as perfect as Kate. I told my mom I knew that feeling because Debbie was such a perfect mom, and I wished she was my mother so I could have turn out perfect like Kate. 

My mom flipped her shit and started yelling at me, asking how I could say that to her. I pointed out that Kate seemed perfect because she had a good childhood with good parents, and I’m sure I would have bloomed into a person like Kate under the same opportunities. 

My mom kicked me out of the party and got mad at me for upsetting everyone with my disrespectful behavior. I went home, and Kate and my brother stopped by later, bringing me some cupcakes and wine. We talked, and neither was mad at me. My mom, however, goes to Facebook to air her dirty laundry and shame me (this is not new behavior, so I’m unfazed by that). Several people called me ungrateful and said my mom did the best she could for us.

1ddrfmi,WIBTA for refusing to leave my dog with a stranger for three weeks to go on vacation?,"I (M36) and currently having a disagreement with my wife (F35) about leaving my dog with her uncle while we go on vacation.

This started when my therapist suggested that me sitting home alone all the time (I work from home) wasn't helping me (PTSD and anxiety from being an ER/PSYCH nurse) and that I should get a dog. I've never had a dog before so I figured I'd try it. My first attempt the puppy had a birth defect and died after a month of having it and I was devastated (no one knew about the defect till the puppy had passed away). My wife convinced me to give it one more go and that led to me getting Sadie, my newfoundland puppy.

This dog has been life changing. Better than any antidepressant I've ever had. My blood pressure is down, I lost weight, I don't have nightmares anymore since she wakes me up if I have one. I train her, I walk her twice a day, we go to group classes for dog training once a week, I brush her, I take her out to the park. She's amazing and she's the sweetest animal I've ever seen. I can go out in public with her without feeling like I'm about to be attacked by something. My therapist suggested training her as a service dog since I qualify for one if she was this helpful so I'm doing that but she isn't fully trained yet as she's only a year and a half old.

Well I was going to go on vacation, and my sister was going to watch the dog for me since my wife wanted some time just the two of us without the dog. I was okay with this when she was going to be at our house with my sister, but my sister's husband got transferred to another state and now they can't watch her. My wife suggested I leave her with her uncle who has a newfoundland and a fenced in yard.

I can't do it, the amount of anxiety I have over something happening to her is insane. She's the perfect dog right now, I'm terrified something is going to happen and I'm going to lose her and then have to go back to what life was like before I got her. I was miserable, no amount of meds helped me, no amount of exercise or eating right made any difference, It was soul crushing and now that I'm better I would do anything to never feel like that again. I know it sounds insane but I had totally given up on ever feeling like a normal person again and then I got Sadie and suddenly I felt like I was me again. I can't even begin to tell you how much of a difference having Sadie has made in my life.

My wife insists everything would be fine and that I'm being a crazy person for not wanting to leave the dog alone to go on a vacation but she understands and says she won't force the issue if I really have a problem with it but I feel like a serious POS for picking a dog over a vacation with my wife. I told her to give me some more time and let me finish her service dog training but she wants me to go on this vacation just the two of us and I'm just horribly uncomfortable leaving her with some stranger I've never even met in a place I've never even been.

1dkpgp0,AITA for telling my younger sister her life is going to suffer?,"I 17f have a younger sister 16f and she has gotten pregnant. She told us 3 months ago and the dad didn't want the baby but she kept it anyways. Well the the other day I was getting ready to go out when my sister was standing in my doorway looking all sad. I asked her what was wrong and she said she wants to go out but is pregnant and cannot go hang out with friends anymore.

I told her she should have took that into consideration when she did what she did. I said her life is going to suffer now that she has to worry about a baby. And that her baby matters more than her now and she should have not did what she did if she wanted to still live out her teenage years.

She started crying and went to her room leaving for me to finish getting ready. My mom came up to me when I got back from hanging out with my friends and said I was rude for saying that to her but I felt like she needed a reality check.

1d94jm5,"AITA for telling my friend to stop saying ""I almost died"" as an excuse?","I (33 F) am friends with a (36 F) named Ashley. Ashley recently had to have an emergency C-section at 6 months pregnant. She and the baby are doing well but the baby girl is in the NICU and she is recovering. When I found out I immediately sent her a care package, bought a crib she couldn't afford, and reached out regularly within the past month. I live across the country  from her so I can't just up and travel. I noticed over that time Ashley would ask for things or complain about feeling that her friends and her child's father are not doing enough for her or being around enough for her. I would do what I can with the monetary requests she has made and reach out to check in when I could. I told her that I am very annoyed by her complaining and she needs to accept that my life does not stop just because she had a baby. She responds by saying ""I almost died giving birth"". I responded that she has said this every time I have spoken to her when she complains about something. I also said that she cannot make monetary requests, complain afterwards, throw almost dying in my face, then make more requests like I'm an unlimited ATM. She said that until I experience what she has then I won't understand where she is coming from and being there for her in these ways shows how important she and the baby are in my life. I responded that in the time since she gave birth I have injured my foot and can barely walk which led to unexpected financial problems and have other challenges in my life that she does not even ask about. I said I was not in the bedroom when she got pregnant so she needs to take this up with the man who knocked her up. We haven't spoken since then and I refuse to help her anymore as long as she acts this entitled.  AITA? 

EDIT: Ashley's child's father is in the picture.  He has been getting complaints from her about not being at the hospital enough. He has had to pick up overtime at work to make up for the lost income. They also have another child, so he has been mostly taking care of the older child while she is in the hospital.

1dejtry,"AITA for ""financially big-footing"" my in-laws?","I (39M) am a few years older than my wife (32F), but we met (5 years ago) at very different phases of our lives. I finished uni at 19 years old, lucked into a great position in finance and became a partner of my firm, making me quite wealthy at a young age. My wife went through several changes of heart about her career path, involving two advanced degrees, through which her parents supported her. She had only recently started her first full time, “professional” job when we met.  Her parents’ (born to wealthy families on the last bits of their fortunes) financial support engendered a belief on their part that she ought to pay heed to their wishes.  While my wife found this behavior bothersome, she is conflict-averse and mostly acceded to their demands.

Her parents offered to pay for our wedding. It quickly became clear that they felt that their contribution entitled them to make most of the choices (including guest list), none of which were congenial to my now-wife. The conflict clearly wore on her, so told her parents that we appreciated their kind offer, but that we would pay for the wedding ourselves.  Perhaps having judged my financial situation by my modest lifestyle, they claimed we were “risking our finances” merely to have our way. I just laughed and said that wasn’t a worry.  We ended up having a swanky destination wedding, accommodations on us, for our friends and close family only.

After we got married, we experienced the same crap. Case in point – vacations. My MIL inherited a beach house, and she insisted that we spend our vacations there at a particular time, to coincide with my SIL, even though the dates were convenient neither to us nor SIL.  When my wife pointed this out, her mother’s response was that it would be difficult to accommodate us at other times, as they had set plans with friends over the course of the summer; that since she and FIL were generously opening their house to us, we needed to conform to her schedule.  Not again! I had been thinking about getting a summer place myself, so I bought one in my wife’s favorite area. It happens to be bigger and nicer than MIL’s.  MIL reacted peevishly to the news, claiming that we were spitefully “bankrupting ourselves to show her up” and that vacations should be spent with family. I replied that, as to the latter point, they were welcome to come spend time with their daughter and SIL (who is great!)…on dates convenient for us.  As to the former, I said, that while I consider it gauche to talk to about money, she should rest easy about our finances, as the new place amounted to less than my last year’s partnership distribution; and that they would be wise to stop trying to exert control with money, since to do it successfully requires an actual fortune,and not just the memory of one as embodied in a broken-down beach house.  My MIL called me a jerk.

I am currently seven months pregnant and the only employee. I maintain a pretty healthy relationship with everybody in town, other stores, even our competitors. I want everyone to feel safe, accepted and welcome. In the time I work, and there are many restaurants, and there is one gentleman who walks through the town and visits at some of the stores on his way to work. He has high functioning autism. He can drive he has a job. He has a masters degree and several other things. I recently told him that I was pregnant so that he could prepare for my leaving for maternity. I let him touch my belly that day. He has been in every single day since, almost three weeks, to come try to touch my belly to feel the baby. The issue is I don't like to be touched. I also don't like people coming up behind me. For contacts I have complex PTSD. And people behind me is one of my triggers.  Also being the only employee I can't often stop. I have expressed to him many times that I cannot stop every day to let him touch my belly and he has recently taken up on him to walk behind me even while I'm with other customers to touch my belly. I told him that was no ok. He didn't come in for two days and when he did a few days later, he tried to touch my belly, but he asked so I said fine. However, he tried lifting my shirt so he could touch my bare skin, and I snapped and said absolutely not. he came back in the next day walk straight towards me trying to feel my belly too, which I told him we cannot do this anymore. You may not come in to touch my belly. It is Taurus season and I am far too busy and I do not like this. Today he tried coming in again and I'm contemplating just telling him he's not allowed in my store anymore. He never buys anything and mostly browses anyway when he was here before. I understand that some people do not have the same concept of personal space however, I do not believe that that is an excuse as I told him many times in a way, he would understand that it was not OK.

1dq5y1k,AITA for looking up what happens in the shows my husband and I watch?,"I was never one to sit down and watch a show or movie before I met my husband. Naturally it was him who introduced me to most if not all of the shows we now watch.  I'm an anxious person by nature and when things are intense I can't enjoy the show so I will look up what happens.

  
My husband gets so upset when I do this because he says the only reason he is rewatching this show/ movie is so that he can watch my reactions to certain things in it and when I look things up I have no reaction at all because I know it's coming.

  
It got particularly heated last night when we started watching this show called the last of us.  It has quite a few tense moments and early on I started to look things up. He saw me doing this and after some back and forth he said he won't be recommending anything else for us to watch if I'm just going to spoil what happens.

  
I think he is being a bit unfair because he had already seen the entire show and knows what happens but im not allowed to know.

1dpajhb,AITA for asking my boyfriend to be sober for once while we make a memory? ,"TLDR: My boyfriend thinks it’s impossible to have fun sober and even try won’t try. we’ve been together for 2 years and has yet to make one memory with me without the interference of drugs/alcohol. 



I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for almost 2 years, we met freshman year of college and are now entering our senior year. 

My boyfriend has had a history with substance abuse (he got a DUI last year and is now on deferred prosecution so he’s on probation for 5 years). He’s been completely sober for about 6 months.

For the entire duration of our relationship he was either drunk or high, or both. We don’t have a single memory together that doesn’t involve drugs or alcohol. I’m a social drinker, but with him being sober and us never “going out” or doing anything, it’s a rare occurrence for me to drink. I never smoke or do any sort of drug. Nothing against it, it’s just not for me. 

There’s a rave he wants to go to in August, he’s never been to one and is really interested in going. Neither of us are fans of EDM but i’ve never been to a rave either. I think it could be fun to experience something new so he suggested we go together. 

We started planning the trip, outfits, and started saving money to be able to go. Then he brings up how he’s going to be on shrooms and acid the entire time we’re there. I asked why and said i wanted to experience something new and fun with him, without the interference of drugs and alcohol for once. he got offended and told me there’s no point in going to a rave sober and that if he can’t do drugs he just won’t go. 

I tried explaining that it’s entirely possible to have fun sober and going to a rave shouldn’t be an excuse to do drugs. Acid and shrooms are cheap, spending hundreds of dollars to go to a rave with the sole purpose of doing drugs seems like a waste to me. 

He flipped out and told me he doesn’t want to go anymore, he doesn’t want to go with me, and i ruined everything.

All i did was ask him to make a memory with me and be fully present for it, for the past 2 years i can’t think of a single “fun” thing we’ve done that he was sober for and it makes me really sad. My boyfriend genuinely thinks it’s impossible to have fun without being under the influence of something, and won’t even try to do something that could possibly be fun if he has to be sober for it. 

Am i the asshole?

1e47r5k,AITA for leaving the dry wedding wedding early to go to go out.,"So 2 weeks ago I 35f went to a wedding in our college town for a member of our college friend group.  My husband and I left the kids with my parents and we went.  We got a Vrbo with another couple I went to college with for a few days.  My husband and I don’t have a ton of time to ourselves away from the kids so we were excited to let loose.

 On the invitation it said the wedding went to 11 with an after party with the bride and groom at the venue.  The venue was a gorgeous mansion and the bride and groom had it for the night, they were leaving for the honeymoon the next morning.  

Cut to wedding day and it’s a dry wedding.  Apparently the groom is 2 years sober.  No one told us this and we were admittedly bummed.  When we found out there was no alcohol we told people we were going to some bars after and not going to the after party.  We left the wedding at 9:30 because we were itching to go out and the wedding was boring.  

Pretty much the whole college crew left around that time and went out.  Apparently, the bride's friend group did not stay for the party, the grooms did and the optics were very lopsided at the party.  We all heard from the bride about this and she called us assholes for leaving.  She said that she didn't feel supported and felt like we were spiteing her now husband for his sobriety.  I told her that she was reading too much into  it.  We just wanted to go out.  She is especially mad at me as i'm looked at as the ringleader of this outing.  I don't think i've done anything wrong AITA?

1e3ggnn,AITA for not punishing my daughter for what she said ,"My husband and I are slightly more well off than my sisters family. Because of this my parents do more for them than they do us. When it comes to gifts my daughter (Maddie 7) get things from the dollar store while my nephews get whole Lego sets, iPads and even Disney trips. If my sister needs babysitting they will drop everything for her last minute. If I need it I have to give them a two week’s heads up as well as proper payment. 

Because of this clear favoritism my daughter doesn’t have a good relationship with them. If you as her about her grandparents her mind automatically goes to my husband’s parents because she forgets that she has two pairs. 

Earlier today we having a rare meet up with my parents. My daughter asked if she can go on the trampoline outside. My dad said no because it’s for my nephews. My daughter begged but dad still said no. Maddie then stomps away and said this is why I like other grandma and grandpa more. My parents looked at me expectantly but I didn’t do anything. I recently got off a call with my mom saying I should have told Maddie that was wrong to say. I told her what do you expect she thinks y’all hate her and y’all do nothing to dispel those thoughts.

1dt7jgf,AITA for telling my husband he needs to quit his dream job?,"So I (32F) and my husband (29M) live in an area with an extremely high cost of living. I work a job that pays decently well, which is kind of necessary to live where we do. My husband worked a job for years that paid less than mine did, but was okay overall, though he absolutely hated working there.

Around October of last year, my husband managed to get a job in his dream career field. He had been working at it for years, and was really excited about finally getting there. However, it's come with 

The big issue is, the pay in his field is abysmal. He works as a freelancer (which is standard in his industry) so his job has zero benefits, and it's a pretty significant pay cut from his old job.

We don't have combined finances, and after he took the new job, we had to rearrange how we pay for things to account for his lower income. Previously, he had covered a slightly larger percentage of the expenses due to me having student loans to pay off while he didn't. As it is now, I have to be the breadwinner since his income was basically halved, paying for a larger portion of the expenses.

I sat him down recently and told him I felt he needed to quit his job and find a better-paying field because it just wasn't feasible. He got upset, since like I said, this is something he's dreamed of for years and worked really hard to get, which I understand. But I just feel this  isn't fair to me. We've had to cut back on a lot of things and there's not really any sign of a pay increase at this point. I feel like I'm carrying him.

He offered to get a part-time job on the side, but I know anything he could get that would be feasible for him while keeping his current job wouldn't provide much. He suggested we move somewhere less expensive, to which I said absolutely not, since we'd have to go quite  a ways to find something in that range and it'd mean ridiculously long commutes to my work and being further away from my family. He offered to have his parents help, which I don't want because it's not a long-term solution.

He's extremely upset, and I understand it, because I know he worked hard to get here. If he quit now, it'd basically kill his career and it would be extremely hard for him to get another shot at this job. It's not like we're struggling, which is true, we can pay rent and put food on the table, but I hate feeling like this. I work long days at a rather difficult job, while he works from home doing something he did before as a hobby and only makes half as much money now. My point is that it's not like he has to stop doing what he does altogether, since as I mentioned, he did it as a hobby beforehand, but he's upset because he said this is the only thing he's ever wanted to do career-wise and giving it up now would mean he likely never would be able to make it work.

1e2mcq3,"AITA For making a scene when my brothers girlfriend tried to ""protect her peace""?","I didn't know how to title the post. I apologise. 

My son is eleven months old and 97th percentile for height. He is a big ass baby (currently 36in tall - or about the size of your average 2.5yo) and in 3T clothing. 

However, despite him being so big, he is still just a baby and most of his nutrition ia still from breastmilk. 

For the 4th we had a big family cookout and my brother invited his girlfriend. I live out of state and I didn't want my flights to be too close together so I'm staying for a bit longer. My brother and his girlfriend are doing the same thing.

My family is aware that my son is a baby, obviously, but my brothers girlfriend was not and was initially very shocked when she saw him ""misbehaving"". We explained that he's still a baby, so he's still just exploring the world.

She remained uncomfortable but we mostly avoid each other. Because he's so big feeding him is a chore so I use an armchair as there isn't enough support elsewhere and so there isn't much I can do about covering up (he gets sweaty under blankets and won't eat).

It's been a tense couple of weeks. Last night I think we both kind of lost it. My son needed feeding and she was in the chair; I asked her to move which she whined about but did get up. Everything was fine for another hour or so until she demanded my brother pay for her to go to a hotel for the remaining nights because she can't cope with me and the baby.

He asked what she meant and she said that he's clearly big enough to be on real food and I enjoy making her uncomfortable by feeding him in front of her. 

I got embarrassingly upset and told her that she should keep her mouth shut because she clearly doesn't know the first thing about parenting and certainly doesn't know anything about me or my son.

We argued the same points for a little more until my son woke from his nap and I left to collect him. She then left after telling us all, loudly, that she needs to ""protect her peace"" (which is honestly not a phrase I thought real people said). 

My brother told me I was being immature and left with her. My dad is on ""my side"" but did tell me I should have removed myself from the situation as I'm a grown woman and she's still a teenager (I'm three years older than her so I think thats BS). My mom is neutral but is still trying to convince my brother to come home and ended up paying for their hotel. She thinks I could have been a lot more understanding.

1e8xr9a,"AITA for refusing to wear a bracelet I wanted, but my husband paid for?","I (29F) wanted to buy a bracelet for myself because I finally had a job after searching for a long time and wanted to treat myself. My husband (35M) suggested I buy it from his parents because they run a jewellery store and they’d offer me a good deal. That had been my plan anyway, so when we visited them (they live in another State), I went by their store and had a look at what they had in stock. I decided on a piece but didn’t take it right away, as I needed to withdraw some cash.

A few days later I overheard my husband talking to his Mom about me but couldn’t hear what it was about (context info: there had been some negative talk in the past about my struggling to find a job & I wanted to know if that’s what it was about).  I asked my husband later what they were discussing about me and he said “nothing” but I got the feeling he felt caught out. Then he said they were talking about the bracelet I wanted and he was going to buy it. I said I was happy to buy it for myself but he insisted, and said he’d sort it out. I was thankful and said okay.

Then, after we returned home I asked about the bracelet and he said he was gonna give it to me later, maybe my birthday. I was annoyed because I wanted to buy the bracelet and wear it, like immediately, and that’s what I would’ve done if he hadn’t bought it. He said he paid for it, and that was a nice thing for him to do. I agreed, but said if he kept it, then it felt like he took it from me, and was making me wait to get something that I was prepared to pay for myself.We had a low-level fight about it, after which he said I can just have it right then, but I said I didn’t even really want it anymore because now every time I wear it, I will think about this argument and the whole gesture feels ruined. He accused me of being ungrateful. 

We recounted this story to his friends (I don’t have many friends as we moved here recently) and they all agreed that he paid for it, so I should just be happy, but I feel like if he wanted to pay for a gift that I had picked out and was about to purchase myself, then it’s not fair to make me wait months for it.

Am I the asshole for being upset about him keeping it / not wanting to wear the bracelet anymore?

1ebfwkq,AITA For turning my teenage niece away at the door and telling my sister to wake up because of how my niece treats my own daughter?,"My sister Teresa has a sixteen year old daughter Quinn. “Quinn” and I used to be very close when she was younger, and loved having auntie-niece time together. However, since becoming a teenager, Quinn has become very snarky and sarcastic in a mean way.



I particularly don’t like the way she behaves towards my own daughter Bella (she is six.) Quinn crosses the line. A particular episode of verbal cruelty at a birthday party was when I’d had enough and told Quinn “I don’t want you to come over until you can start being nice to Bella.” Teresa was present when I said this.



We live a short walk away from each other. A few days ago, Quinn arrived and wanted dinner, and I turned her away at the door and told her “I don’t like how you treat my daughter. Unless it is an emergency, you are not welcome over.”



Teresa called me because she said I was a horrible person for turning Quinn away because she is sixteen and my niece was upset.



(Teresa has stopped trying to do anything serious about Quinn’s verbal attitude and has justified it in the past with statements along the lines of “That’s just how some teenagers are,” “It’s a teen thing. Teenagers shouldn’t be treated like young children,” or “Quinn’s almost an adult. It’s not your place to parent her like some child.”



I brought up Teresa’s past words and told her she is correct that Quinn is an adult who doesn’t need to be scolded by me. And I have a right to protect my child from an unkind adult. Quinn is already having issues with the school emailing home or friends making excuses for why they don’t want to see her. And it’s time to Teresa to wake up and do something about her daughter.



Teresa and I have both given our sides to mutual friends and acquaintances, and they are divided. Some are saying that Quinn’s attitude is not okay, but I was wrong to turn her away at the door because she’s still sixteen and my niece.



They said being a teenager and rapidly going from childhood to adulthood is already a rough transition. And according to Teresa, Quinn appears to be having issues at school, and I should try to have more patience with her and see what may be going on outside of home.

1eektaw,AITA for telling my SIL how I feel about her baby name after she asked?,"I 28F have a SIL Ana 35F. She is 8 months pregnant. She has had 3 miscarriages in the past and had to have an abortion after her last pregnancy was not viable. 

Her pregnancy is taking a huge toll on her, she had awful morning sickness and pre existing medicinal conditions that have worsened and she is on sick leave. 

I offered to plan her baby shower as she was unable to, and offered up our place for her and BIL as it was mainly family and a few friends that I know through her. 

The baby shower was a hit, Ana was really pleased with how everything turned out and at the shower told everyone that she is keeping the gender of her baby a surprise, but her and BIL picked out a name for the baby. They want to name the baby Five as the number is the amount of years they have tried to conceive and it took them 3 miscarriages and one termination.

Ana said it’s a reminder of her baby’s older siblings, and I expressed in private after she asked what I thought of the name that it might not be this symbolic for their baby when they grow up to understand the meaning, I did say the word burden which led to Ana getting really upset and left, and my BIL followed her out. 

BIL called me after and was upset and said I made Ana cry and ruined the baby shower.  My husband agrees with me on the name Five, but he thinks it wasn’t our place to say anything and that Ana and his brother had been through a lot of infertility struggles and that I should just let her have the name as there are worse names she could have picked. Five is a unique name but I was just trying to point out the meaning of the name they had picked, and the implications of it.",Sensitive-Gain9314,5198,2173,0.959999978542328,0.5120153097140159,1722208979,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1eektaw/aita_for_telling_my_sil_how_i_feel_about_her_baby/,2024,7,AmItheAsshole,2024-07-28 23:22:59
1eg624k,AITA for not caring that I was uninvited to my older brother’s wedding,"
This whole thing is so weird. I, (27M), am gay. I came out at 16 and my parents told me they would always love me, but to not mention it to my older brother who I'll call Brick, (then 19M, 30M now). When I was confused and asked why, they said that Brick had expressed some awful opinions about gay people. I limited talking to Brick until I moved out at 18, which wasn't much of a problem because we were never close.

I went to uni, got good job, and an awesome boyfriend (28M), in my home city. Me and my boyfriend Angel live a peaceful life. Peaceful until a few days ago when I got a call from my brother. I was concerned that Brick was calling me, as we have never messaged before, just had each other's numbers for emergency purposes. I picked up because maybe there was some emergency happening.

He opened the call with an annoyed ""hey man"" and I knew something was up. He said he was getting married to his fiance Yen (24F) next year. I didn't even know he had a girlfriend! I was like ""that's great Brick!"" and asked some boring wedding things that he begrudgingly answered. He then told me invites were being sent out in a couple weeks, and that I could bring a plus one. Here's where I made the mistake that started this mess. Without thinking like an idiot, I said, ""cool, I'll bring my boyfriend."" Major. Mess up. Brick immediately started yelling insults down the line, screaming that he ""wouldn't have an [f slur] at his wedding."" I didn't say anything and just hung up. I was rattled by hearing those words from my own brother's mouth, even though I knew his feelings about people like me. I told Angel, and he comforted me, ordering in my favourite restaurant and watching movies with me, which was awesome. We went to bed later and I felt alright the next day.

I sent my parents a message that Brick invited me and uninvited me from his wedding pretty much in the same breath, and went on my way to work, not a clue of the crapstorm waiting for me when I got off. When I turned my phone on again after my shift, it was blowing UP. Messages and calls from my parents and relatives galore asking me what the f happened? I phoned my parents back when I got home and gave them the run down of what happened, and said I honestly didn't care because it's not like Brick would be coming to my wedding anyways. My parents immediately chastised me for my ""obvious disinterest and disregard of my brother's life"" and told me I should be apologizing to HIM for bringing my personal life into his wedding. WHAT? I basically told my parents to screw off and have been getting bombarded with messages from relatives to apologize to my brother and get my invite reinstated, and apologize to my parents for disrespecting them, but I really don't want to. Angel's reassuring me that I did nothing wrong, but it's still nagging me.

1ec9xtp,AITA for not helping my younger sister just because she has Cancer?,"Okay so before the story I want to give background. Our dad is pacific islander, and our mom (38F) is just white. My sister (14F) and I (17F) were both born in the US. Our parents divorced when I was six I think. However I continued to live my dad until I was 11, whereas my sister stayed with my mom. I live with my mom now because my dad wanted to move back to the islands, but I didn't want to leave my friends. However I know much of my family who still do live on the islands, and keep in touch with my 'roots' I guess. This is mostly thanks to my dad. My sister doesn't. Okay so onto the story. 

About four months ago my sister was diagnosed with Sarcoma which is like a kind of bone/tissue cancer. She's had to go through a lot of procedures and spend a lot of time at the hospital, and I've spent a lot of it with her and helping her, and while I don't mind helping her, when she did get diagnosed my Mom expected me to drop literally everything to be there to help her. Meaning if she's at the hospital, I'm at the hospital. If she's undergoing a surgery or 'stressful procedure' I have to stop everything I'm doing (including school) and sit in the waiting room as support. 

But all that I could handle and it was annoying but whatever. However recently the doctors finally decided they wanted to do Chemo, and my sisters hair has begun to fall out. She shaved it, but is extremely upset about it, because she really loved her hair. The other day my mom suggested that I shave my own hair so a wig can be made out of it for her. For reference my hair goes down to below my butt. However the thing is you're only supposed to cut your hair when a family member dies, and it's a tradition my entire family (dad's side) upholds. And to be frank, I like my hair and have no desire to shave it, as I have been growing it out since I was a kid. 

I explained this to both my sister and my mom, but both are instant that I should do it, and that a tradition like that is meaningless, especially since my sister might die anyways. I told them no. They've both asked several times more, and my sister even begging. I once again reiterated why I wouldn't, and that asking me too was insulting. 

Now my sister is upset and saying that I obviously don't actually care that she's struggling and aren't being understanding. However I've bent over backwards for her, so the fact she's going so far hurts. But she's also never asked me of anything like this before and is really upset, so I just don't know, AITA??",IamGojoTrust,6798,1194,0.959999978542328,0.4469336064345306,1721951817,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ec9xtp/aita_for_not_helping_my_younger_sister_just/,2024,7,AmItheAsshole,2024-07-25 23:56:57

1e6pq34,AITA For not taking the blame for unknowingly breaking a mom's rules for her kid?,"My (41f) daughter (15) had a sleepover a couple of days ago with four of her friends. From what I observed, the girls had a lot of fun together and were all very respectful of each other, my husband, and I. Most of the girls’ parents thanked me and my husband for hosting and said positive things, but one texted me a list of all the things I did wrong.

The first thing that upset this mom was the fact that my daughter and her friends went swimming in our backyard pool. When the sleepover invites were sent out via text message, I asked the moms if they were okay with their girls going swimming. All of them said “yes” or “that’s okay with me” except for the complaining mom, who simply liked my text. I assumed this meant yes. I would not have allowed this had the girls not been forced to pass a swimming safety unit (which included a swim test at the end) for their PE class. Additionally, my husband completed a lifeguarding course from the Red Cross and passed with flying colors. The mom’s second issue was the food the girls ate, which she deemed unhealthy. I however, did not see an issue with this because I think eating junk at sleepovers is okay. The next issue was the movie the girls watched after dinner. Since some of the girls are 14 and others are 15, we told them no R rated movies, but other than that it was up to them. They ended up choosing The Fault In Our Stars, which the complainer deemed inappropriate. The final thing she was mad about was the fact that the girls didn’t actually go to sleep until midnight. As a mom myself, I understand because I want my daughter to get enough sleep. However, both my husband and I do think that sleepovers are a time when it’s okay to stay up late, provided the kids let the parents sleep (which my daughter and her friends did). Additionally, the girls woke up at 8:30, meaning they got about 8 1/2 hours of sleep. 

I received the complaining mom’s text on the day after the sleepover. The text said “Thank you for having my daughter over. It was generous of you to open up your home and graciously host her. However, I feel that many of your decisions were questionable and inappropriate”. She then proceeded to list her objections with specific reasons for each one. I then replied, “Please tell your daughter thanks for coming! She was a pleasure to host. I understand your concerns, but considering that you never communicated your expectations or rules, I don’t think it’s fair to place the blame on me. If we ever do things like this in the future, please make sure to let me know of any restrictions ahead of time. Thank you and have a lovely weekend!” She then responded angrily that it was my fault, and when I texted her to say sorry, she didn’t respond. AITA for not taking the blame?

1dzhg1z,AITA for not allowing my kids a snack after dinner ,"I (28f) and my husband (32m) have 3 beautiful boys together aged 8, 7, and 4. Almost every evening we sit together at the table as a family and enjoy dinner. We have a strict rule that if you don’t finish your plate, you don’t get a snack later or dessert. If our kids are full before their plate is gone, we let them leave the table but save their plate in case they ask for a snack later. This really hasn’t been an issue until recently and specifically tonight where my husband and I got into a fight in front of the kids disagreeing if they could have a snack or not after dinner. For background purposes, financially I would say we are equal when it comes to income. My husband makes twice as much as me and pays all of the bills except the mortgage. I pay the mortgage, our youngest’s daycare, and I buy our groceries and any household necessities. We don’t fight about finances. Recently my husband has been not allowing the kids to have a snack after dinner even if they finish their plate. I’ve been arguing back saying “they finished, they’re allowed a snack.” Tonight our 7 year old asked for a snack after dinner and my husband flipped saying “don’t ask again you’re not having any more food tonight.” I told him he was being unreasonable and snuck my 7 year old down to have a clementine and a banana. My husband thinks I’m the asshole for undermining his decision that the kids won’t have snacks but I think he’s being unreasonable and if we have the means to fed our kids dinner and snacks after why wouldn’t we? So am I the asshole? 

(Edit I titled this wrong, I let my kids have a snack after dinner, my husband didn’t sorry)

INFO: My kids snack freely throughout the day. We give them small portions at dinner. The reason we keep the plate if they don’t finish is because they will sometimes have a bite or two of dinner and say they’re full, then minutes later ask for dessert.",left_butt_cheek,3364,2074,0.8899999856948853,0.4215910566927203,1720569144,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dzhg1z/aita_for_not_allowing_my_kids_a_snack_after_dinner/,2024,7,AmItheAsshole,2024-07-09 23:52:24
1dt7idd,AITA for asking my husband to hold his pee during flight with 2 kids,"My husband and I flew a 3.5hr flight with our 3mo old and 2.5yo recently. We were unable to buy seats together so I was in the middle aisle with baby and he was across the aisle of me with the aisle seat and the toddler in the middle. 

About an hour into the flight my husband gets up to pee while I’m nursing baby and as soon as he leaves the toddler crawls over to me. I try to get the toddler to sit on my lap but he causes baby to stop eating so baby is crying on me while I’m trying to hold the toddler and not disrupt the two people I’m sitting next to. Plus my husband got stuck behind the beverage cart so he could grab the toddler for 20 minutes. 

Later, my husband gets up to pee again while I’m feeding baby and same thing happens of trying to feed baby with a toddler on my lap. Ending up with a crying baby and a toddler in one middle seat.


Back story, my husband pees a lot. I’ve worked with a pelvic floor therapist and told her how frequently he pees and she agrees it’s too much and he should work with PT to avoid issues down the road. He says he doesn’t need help and blames it on drinking lots of water.

After the flight, I told my husband how hard it was to balance both boys and asked if he can just hold his pee. So many times I have to pee when I’m watching the boys but hold it until timing is better. He said he can’t.

Next, I asked if he could ask me before he pees and go when baby isn’t nursing and I have two hands. He said no and he should be able to pee when he has to go. 

We have a full summer of flying ahead of us including a few international trips and I’m worried.

1e4962n,AITA for banning my roommates girlfriend for touching my raw cookie dough?,"I rent a room to a lad called AJ. He’s 31. He is dating Nina (25f). I don’t mind if AJ has people over or anything but Nina has been here a lot. 
I am already annoyed because Nina always asks to borrow stuff from me. “Can I borrow a pair of pants for work I forgot mine? Do you have extra face masks or can I borrow lotion/tampons/socks?” 
I have always told her no. I don’t make a lot and I don’t loan things. She was furious I wouldn’t give her a pad but I use a diva cup and period underwear and I am NOT sharing those. 🤮 
She got mad I wouldn’t loan her a dress for their “surprise” date night. I told her if she asks again for ANYTHING of mine then she’s not allowed back in the apartment. 
I told her to stop acting like we are friends and don’t use my stuff. Short of like medical things (bandaids) she should go buy her own stuff. 
This led to AJ being mad at me for making her feel unwelcome. I said I don’t want her around at all and the next time it happens I’m gonna ban her. He said she is not that bad. 
I ended up letting him know one more step over the line and she’s gone. 
And if he breaks that ban, he can find a new place as he is month to month. 
Nina ended up being fine for a few days. I was making cookies from scratch. They come in from some date. She sees the cookies and asks the kind. I tell her chocolate chip and she comes over, sticks her finger in the dough, and takes a chunk. 
I got so mad I told her to get out.  She’s banned. I didn’t care. When AJ tried to argue with me I said I am not renewing his lease if she’s not gone in two minutes.

1dwb70t,AITA - I asked my fiancé to get me a drink in bed,"This is my first time posting on reddit. Slightly confused by our interaction tonight. As background, we have 4.5 month old twins that have only just started sleeping through the night, so having time to ourselves again in the evening is a novelty. He works.. I look after the twins 5 days a week 8-6. 

We were settled in bed watching tv. I had brought us up a drink each about an hour before this. I asked him if he would mind grabbing us another drink as I was warm in bed. He said no. I asked why, and he replied that he was also in bed.

I was a little annoyed. More so because every single morning I bring him a coffee in bed (even when I was pregnant and the smell made me gag). I bring him drinks if I’m in bed and he is thirsty in the bath. I’d get up to hoover the moths away if they make him uncomfortable. I think my love language is acts of service. If you read into that sort of stuff. I always thought that doing something like that isn’t a big deal if it’s for your partner.

I told him I was a bit put out - just to be honest with him. He told me he was not my personal slave and he didn’t realise that he had to ‘jump’ whenever I told him to. Please bear in mind, I have never asked him for a drink in bed before, or anything else unreasonable that I can think of. I told him I didn’t think of him that way at all.. I just told him that if it was the other way around I’d just do it because it was something nice to do for your partner. He disagreed and said I was being unreasonable and stupid for getting upset about it. 

This eventually turned into an argument. He told me to ask ‘anyone’ about it and I would realise that I am in the wrong. So I thought… maybe reddit? 

Is this issue arising just because we have different ways of expressing love and affection etc? Or is it a deeper issue? Am I being unreasonable - it’s something I’m willing to work on if so.

1dym5c5,AITA for Not Inviting My Sister to My Wedding After She Ruined My Proposal?,"I (29M) recently got engaged to my girlfriend (28F), and it was supposed to be one of the happiest moments of our lives. I had planned a romantic proposal at our favorite spot, a secluded beach where we had our first date. I had everything ready: flowers, a small picnic, and a photographer hiding nearby to capture the moment.

When the day came, my sister (32F) insisted on tagging along. She said she wanted to take a few ""candid"" photos of us before the proposal. I was hesitant but agreed, thinking it might make the moment more special. Big mistake.

As we reached the spot, my sister started acting weird, making snarky comments and trying to direct the whole scene like a movie. My girlfriend could sense something was off, and the mood was getting ruined. Then, out of nowhere, my sister grabbed the ring box from my pocket and yelled, ""Surprise! Look what he's going to do!"" My girlfriend was shocked, and I was furious.

I managed to salvage the proposal somewhat, but the moment was tainted. My girlfriend said yes, but we both felt the proposal was ruined. Later, I confronted my sister, and she just laughed it off, saying she was ""just trying to help"" and that I was overreacting.

Fast forward to our wedding planning, and my fiancée and I decided not to invite my sister. We wanted our day to be about us, without any unnecessary drama. When my family found out, they were furious. My parents called me heartless, and my sister is playing the victim, saying I'm tearing the family apart over a ""little joke.""

Now I'm feeling conflicted. AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding after she ruined my proposal?

Edit: Here are a few other, not so minor, instances in which my sister has done me wrong:

	1.	My sister has a long history of attention-seeking behavior. She’s the type to fake fainting at parties just to get everyone’s attention. She once “accidentally” set off the fire alarm at my fiancée’s birthday party, causing the whole place to evacuate and ruining the celebration.
	2.	This wasn’t the first time she’s crossed the line with me. When I got my first big promotion, she announced she was pregnant at the same party, only to later admit she was joking. At another family event, she spiked the punch with alcohol knowing I was on medication that strictly prohibited drinking.

1eeiyw4,AITA for asking my parents to stop telling people I am in hospital?,"Hi all. I (25f) am currently pregnant and have been admitted to hospital a few days ago for a suspected clot in my lung following severe chest pain. I am still in hospital right now.

A few weeks ago, my wonderful maternal grandfather passed from cancer and we are obviously as a family still upset.

2.5 years ago I was in a car accident. I broke my back in 3 places, my pelvis, and 3 ribs. It was during COVID so I was admitted to hospital and had loads of scans all through the day/night. Once they figured that I didn’t need corrective surgery they discharged me the following morning with morphine tablets and a wheelchair. I came out of hospital to  around 100 messages from people I barely knew wishing me well. My mum and stepdad had posted pictures of my wrecked car on Facebook and told everyone they knew about the accident and specifics about my injuries. At the time I asked them to take down the posts as I did not want people knowing all about my personal life. They never took the posts down.

Today my friend told me that my mum has been sending messages into group chats telling people that I am pregnant and in hospital. My stepdad told his family the same. I have told them that my husband and I want to share the news ourselves. I told them that I was so hurt and disappointed that they have told people and also lied to me about it. I pointed out the lie and told them that I had again, received messages from others proving that they lied. My mum then sent me a voice note of her crying saying “sorry I don’t know what I have done but I am sorry. I must be the worst mother in the world. I am just so upset about Pappa too.” It was hard to hear her so upset by I just reiterated that asking for privacy was not too much to ask.

My stepdad who I have been very close to also sent me a voice note telling me that “they don’t need this stress” and to stop being so hateful over something so “trivial”. He told me that I was clearly hormonal but that he’ll “let it slide this time” because I am pregnant. He told me that my mum has cried for over 30 mins and it’s all my fault and that it’s all over nothing. Also, that they told other people because they are worried about me. Hesaid they will never apologise as they haven’t done anything wrong. He also said that I am the daughter he never had and that he loves me but that he is so disappointed in my behaviour.

The original message that started this sent to my mum:

Sorry it’s just I’ve had messages from people today wishing me well in hospital so I know you lied about who you have told about me being here. I am just hurt and disappointed as I would have much preferred privacy. I don’t feel like sharing any more because I don’t know who you are both sharing it with and it has actually made me being in hospital much more stressful

I might be TA because we are all grieving and emotions are running high. I also don’t feel like they told other people in a malicious way, just thoughtless. So, AITA?

Last night Doug got a long message from Patty saying she was really shocked at how jealous, immature,Petty and mean I am given my age and that I should be more secure in our marriage and in myself and that it's okay for Doug to care about others besides just me. She also told him how much him telling her she was his favorite girlfriend all those years ago had always meant to her and can't understand why I had to shit on it.

Doug told her he was sorry what I said upset her but that I was just saying a fact, I was the favorite girlfriend and that's a huge reason he married me. She sent back another long text saying I just think I'm better than her because Doug had a very firm stand that he would never marry, he didn't care if he had a gun to his head it wouldn't happen. When we reconnected this time he asked me to marry him after a month and we married after 8 and a half months. Doug told her that it wasn't true,I don't think I'm better than anyone and said again he was sorry she was hurt but that I said nothing wrong,told her the things she was saying about me aren't true and to be er speak about me like that again. 


I truly never in a million years would want to hurt anyone's feelings. I said I was his favorite because I feel like you marry your favorite person don't you? Why would you marry someone who isn't your favorite? So am I the asshole here? Doug told me it's not in anyway on me that she got hurt. My best friend said that I didn't say anything that wasn't true and thinks maybe Patty is going through some stuff or just went through a break up and is just taking it out on me.

1e53bxy,AITA for not moving so a child to sit down on public transport? ,"There is public transport where I live (Subway) and like anywhere, it’s generally understood you give up your seat for someone who is elderly, disabled, or pregnant. I always try to do this.

I was sitting down on the Subway this week and who I assume were parents (mom, dad) with two kids got on. There was one available seat which one child sat on, and then the mom asked if I could give up my seat for the other child.

I politely refused and said something along the lines of ‘sorry I don’t want to give up my seat, I’m on this train for a long time’ (which is true, it’s a long journey for me).

Another part of the reason, even though it’s embarrassing and I didn’t say, is that I have bad blisters on my feet at the moment. 

The mom responded ‘wow, you wouldn’t give up your seat for a child?’ 

I said that I wouldn’t, and then someone else on the train gave up their seat. 

Even if I hadn’t had blisters on my feet, I still don’t think I would have given up my seat for a child. They don’t have problems standing, and probably have better balance than most adults. I know I have a bias here because I’m purposefully child free and my pet peeve is parents who feel they or their children are entitled to be the priority. 

While this was happening, everyone on the train was looking at me like I’m a massive ass. So Am I the Asshole? 

________

EDIT: thanks everyone for your thoughts, didn’t expect this to blow up! The consensus seems to be NTA but a few people have said it depends on the age of the child, or that I should’ve said I had blisters, which is fair. I’m not great at telling ages of children but maybe he was 7? He was definitely able to stand on his own well- I just googled 7 year old child and the images there seem about right. 

Also just to clarify, I do not hate children at all. I made a choice not to have kids and I don’t think people who made that choice should take priority over me, but I’m not a kid hater at all. I support everyone’s right to choose whether or not they have kids. 

Interestingly lots of people assumed I’m a man. I’m a 33 year old woman.

1dxsnxf,AITA for refusing to help my brother pay for his wedding after he hijacked my graduation party?,"So, I (23F) just graduated from university a few weeks ago. My family threw me a small party to celebrate, and I was really looking forward to it because I'm the first in our fam to get a degree. My older brother, Jake (28M), has always been the favorite, but I've tried not to let it get to me.

Anyway, Jake and his fiancée, Lisa (26F), show up to the party. Everything's going great until Jake decides to give a toast. At first, it's all nice and congratulatory, and then BOOM—he drops the bomb that he and Lisa are getting married in two months. The whole room goes nuts, and just like that, my graduation party turns into their engagement party.

I was totally blindsided and honestly pretty hurt. I mean, I get it, weddings are exciting, but couldn't he have waited for a different day to announce it? I sucked it up and put on a brave face for the rest of the night, but it definitely stung.

Fast forward to last week. Jake and Lisa come to me asking for help with their wedding expenses. They know I've been saving up from my part-time job and side hustles, and they just assumed I'd be down to chip in. I straight-up told them no. I said after what happened at my graduation, I didn't feel like helping out.

Jake and Lisa flipped out, calling me selfish and saying I'm holding a grudge. My mom thinks I should help because ""family helps family,"" but my dad actually backs me up, saying I have every right to feel the way I do.

Now Jake's been telling the whole extended family that I'm being petty, and some of them have been hitting me up, saying I should just get over it and help him out. Others are on my side, saying Jake was way out of line.

1e49bdy,AITA for refusing to drive my fiancée to the train station after he missed his bus,"My (24F) fiancée (25M) has ADHD and has a difficult keeping a schedule which often results in him sleeping past his alarm. Today he was supposed to catch the bus at 7:30am but missed it.

I work shiftwork and had just finished my third 12 hour night shift in a row. My commute home is about 45 mins, so I got home just before 8:00am, and woke up my fiancée upon entry. He was upset with himself right away as he usually is when he sleeps in. 

We’ve had this issue in the past and I’ve previously told him that if he really needed a ride to the train station, I would prefer to pick him up at the front door (we live in an apartment) because once I’m parked in the garage and make it upstairs I’m tired and prefer not to leave again at this point (which I’ve still done in the past for him). I would say I probably drive him at least once every 2 weeks when he’s late.

He asked me if I’d drive him to the train station today, which would save him a 30 minute walk for his already long 1.5hr commute, but I declined. I was hesitant at first, but decided that I deserve to put myself first. He seemed upset, and did make a comment saying “I better see you in bed in 2 minutes then”, but eventually went on his way. Approx 30 mins later, he texted me saying that he knows it wasn’t good timing but that he really could’ve used the drive today. 

Later today he called and I expressed to him how I was upset by this. He said he was also upset because I wasn’t there for him when he needed me and that he would’ve done it for me if the roles were reversed, and that he was scared there was a limit to how much he could lean on me. Also that he hopes I’m happy that I got what I wanted and for me to enjoy my extra 30 mins of sleep.

To be fair, I’m not working today, so I’m able to sleep in later and it would’ve only taken me about 30 mins in total. I feel a bit guilty as realistically it wouldn’t have been that much of a burden to drive him and it means it would help him out a lot. I know he’s been having a rough time lately and worked 7 days this week, and is already angry with himself as is.",steinmatron,1834,992,0.9399999976158142,0.2110999286969712,1721085303,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e49bdy/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_fiancée_to_the/,2024,7,AmItheAsshole,2024-07-15 23:15:03

1dvivsn,AITA for getting high at my sister’s wedding?,"Hi everyone. I'm using an anonymous account here because people I know follow me. I'm 22M and in the UK btw, but I don't think this will affect the post it's just for context.

My sister (31F) has been planning her wedding for the past year. We're not very close and we've had a lot of issues in the past, so she was mainly inviting me just to be polite I think. We've had issues because I've had drug problems since I was about 15, and I used to make her pick me up from sketchy places in my town when I was high for example, and she saw me at some really low points in my life. She said that I could come if I promised I wouldn't get high, and even then she really had to convince my BIL to let me attend because he doesn't like me at all.

I had honestly been doing really good lately, and I haven't gotten high in a few months. I made a really good plan with my sister, and I knew that if I wanted to get high then I could just tell her and she'd get my parents or something. The thing is, on the day I didn't know my old friend would be there and we were catching up for a while. Eventually he offered me coke and I felt bad if he did it alone. I honestly wasn't thinking of my sister at all and I feel bad for getting wrapped up in the moment, but I was obviously high when I was talking to my BIL and he noticed and told me to leave because ""I can't even follow through on one fucking promise"" and he thinks I'm a really bad person for lying. I wasn't lying and I was genuinely trying, I told him this but he wasn't listening he just kept being like ""okay buddy it's time to go"".

I don't think anyone noticed I left anyway but in the morning my parents told me that they weren't talking to me for the foreseeable future and that I've really hurt my sister now. AITA? My sister won't answer my calls either. I have genuinely really been trying, and I feel bad for throwing it away but I don't think my family should be cutting me off over a mistake. They haven't acknowledged that I've been sober these past few months too, and I would've really appreciated some encouragement.

1efehhz,WIBTA if I didn’t let my sister wear her wedding dress to my wedding?,"Three years ago, my sister’s (36F) fiancé died in a work accident, 4 months before they were supposed to get married. They had been together for a long time and had a kid together, the only reason they didn’t marry earlier is money. This was obviously a horrible experience for her, and she’s understandably very upset about never having gotten to marry the love of her life. 

I (27M) recently got engaged. At first I was pretty hesitant to bring up the wedding around my sister, because I didn’t want to upset her or bring up any bad memories, but she was really excited about it and immediately started helping me to plan. She loves weddings, and pretty clearly was interested in my wedding being similar to her own idea of a perfect wedding. I didn’t mind this, because I’m not nearly as good at this type of thing and she took my vetoes with grace. 

A week ago she brought up the idea of her wearing the dress she bought for her own wedding to mine. My mother, who’s usually very strict on traditions like not wearing white to a wedding, thought it was a great idea. She argued that because I’m marrying another man, no one would mistake her for the bride, and it would let my sister have the wedding experience she always wanted. 

I think she’d stand out a lot like that. My sister will be my maid of honour (best woman?) and the plan was for her dress to match my financés best man.

I did do my best to be conscious of my sister’s loss. I don’t mind something to honour her fiancé, like an empty chair or a memorial table dedicated to him. I offered her some bride experiences that she missed out on like the father daughter dance. I just feel like a full wedding dress is a lot, and the idea makes me a bit uncomfortable. I feel bad for being bothered by it because a wedding isn’t nearly important to me as it is to her- I’d have been fine just getting legally married with no ceremony or anything, so I don’t know why the thought of my sister wearing what she wants upsets me. 

I know my sister would accept it if I said no, but she’s so excited about the idea and she’s pretty set on never remarrying so this is probably her only opportunity to wear this dress. I brought up to my mom that I was hesitant to say yes and she got really upset with me, and accused me of being jealous of her and needing all the attention. WIBTA?

1edsnjz,AITA for decline my Step Dad's call when they couldn't find me at my Step Brother's wedding?,"I (27F) was at my stepbrother's (29M) wedding a couple of days ago. For some context, my mum (59F) and his dad (57M) have been together for 10+ years at this point. My stepbrother even included my mum in the family photos at the wedding and thanked her for looking after his dad in his speech. I could not be happier for her as this meant a lot to her. However, I was not included in family photos. This hurt me a little but it was his and his now wife's day so I'm not going to complain and I certainly would never bring it up to them or anyone else other than my partner. Especially not to my mum who was so shocked and happy that she was included. 

Anyways, this leads on to the matter at hand. My stepdad was talking to the brides mother later in the night whilst I was sat near them, half listening and bopping along to the music. The brides mum says to him that its lovely to have my stepbrother in the family and that now she has 4 children instead of two (both her daughters are now married). This is when my step dad turned around and said that he feels the same and he is very proud of his four. (My two stepbrother and both their wives). This instantly felt like a dagger to my gut (I should probably add that my mums previous partner said to my face as a 7 year old that he never wanted to be a father to me when I asked if I could get him a fathers day card, plus my own father left when i was two and was abusive for context as to why this hurt me so much) and my mum started questioning if I was okay. I said I was fine and to leave it but she kept badgering me and then asked me if I had been eavesdropping when I shouldn't have been. I barely nodded when she said she had heard it too and said that it hurt her too but that he hadn't been thinking. Her comforting me set me off with tears that I'd been trying hard to keep in so I got up and said I was going outside for some air. 

  
I went outside and walked a little bit away and had a cry to myself. I even sat on a swing at the small playpark near and in eyesight of the hotel. When I got myself together I was walking back when my Step dad rang me. I could see him and mum in front of the hotel, he then rang me and I waved and declined the call but they did not see me. My mum questioned me when I did walk back inside the hotel asking if I declined the call to which I replied yes. She then told me that was a stupid thing to do. I tried to explain that I could see them and waved at them but she said they could not see me. 

The next morning, my stepdad did apologise and say he messed up but I'm still a little upset. I've not said anything to my mum about how I'm feeling cause I know she will just tell me to move on and let it go. Am I the asshole? Should I have just answered the phone? Was I being petty?

1ebeh6m,AITA for not allowing MIL and SIL into the third floor of my house?,"I(36F) have been married to my husband(37M) for 12 years. We have 2 kids (9F and 6F).

You should keep in mind that in Muslim marriages, his money is our money, but my money is my money. He can't ever tell me what to do with it, neither can he force me to share expenses. Also, there is no community property/money, if it doesn't have your name on it, you have no right to it.

Before we got married, my husband lived in a house that he co-owned with his mom and sister, and according to him, they would visit maybe 10 days a year (combined).

Suddenly, when we got married, they would come to ""their house"" every other weekend. I complained to my parents, and they advised me to not sink any money into the house. My dad helped me to buy a plot of land, and I spent my money (since my husband covered almost 90% of our expenses) to build my own house. It's a 4 story house (think NYC buidlings, with garages on the ground floor).

Fast foreward to last April, and suddenly his sister decided that she wants to move into ""her house"". They are a family of 5, and there was no way we would have been able to live in a 3 bedroom house. Let alone how they were disrespectful, and juat did not believe in privacy.
 
I told my husband that I will be moving with the kids to my house, and he is free to come with if he wants (he used to insist we stay in that house as a matter of principal, I was just waiting to finish building my house). He agreed.

Last weekend MIL, SIL and her kids came to ""visit"", we gave them a short tour, then we stayed on the first floor that didn't have bedrooms.

After lunch they wanted to nap, so I set the living room for them, they were upset, and wanted to use the kids bedrooms (like they used to do before), I refused. It escalated, and I told them this is my house, I make the rules, and the rules are the third floor is for my immediate family only.

They left, and went NC with us, so AITA?",Over-Fruit-3455,2550,269,0.959999978542328,0.1434762043172394,1721859810,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ebeh6m/aita_for_not_allowing_mil_and_sil_into_the_third/,2024,7,AmItheAsshole,2024-07-24 22:23:30
1ebgfa3,AITA for excluding my girlfriend from my birthday celebration because of what she said?,"I (23M) just had my birthday this past Sunday. I celebrated in part by meeting up with my aunt (45F) for brunch. My aunt and I share our birthday and have always spent at least part of the day together. It’s a tradition that’s really important to both of us. 

A couple weeks ago, my girlfriend (23F) said she wanted to throw me a birthday party, especially since now we have enough fun money to spend on something like that. I said that would be great, but it probably couldn’t be on my birthday-day, since I was meeting my aunt for brunch and then had to go into work early the next day, so an evening party would have to end early too. 

We then had a long discussion that turned into an argument over having a celebration on the actual day or not. It became clear that she wanted me to reschedule brunch and that was my line. I told her that time with my aunt on our birthday is more important to me than spending it with anyone else (part of her reason for having it that day was that a few friends would be in town then but not the following weekend). 

I told her part of the reason why it matters, which is that my aunt was a twin and her twin died when they were teenagers. Their birthday was hard for her and then, when I was unexpectedly born on the same day (I was premature), it made the day easier for her to handle. She never put all that on me as a kid, but told me when I was an adult how grateful she was that we were “birthday buddies” and that it had felt like a blessing. My aunt is an amazing lady and I have always loved sharing our birthday. I was even more glad when she told me all of that. 

When I told this all to my girlfriend though, her first reaction was that it was “messed up that your aunt uses you as an emotional crutch and that you’re a grown man who can make his own plans”. I think my feelings must have shown on my face because she tried to backtrack or qualify her statement or whatever, but I wasn’t having it. I told her that there was no need to throw me a birthday party at all. 

What I ended up doing was having the brunch as planned with just me and my aunt, and then my parents had a cookout with a lot of our family there. I didn’t invite my girlfriend and when I explained why, my family was kind of split. They all agreed that what she said wasn’t nice or true, but some thought that it also wasn’t kind to exclude her from my birthday entirely when it had clearly mattered to her. 

She and I have hung out both before and after my birthday and there is a tension there. Part of me wants to address it but I also don’t feel bad about what I did, so I don’t know if bringing it up would do much good. 

AITA?

Editing to clarify some things:

- girlfriend and I started dating last December, so it’s been nearly 8 months

- I didn’t want to write out the very long conversation we had where we tried to make plans around the existing time constraints (the brunch was already planned and we knew what the out of town friends’ schedule would be - that sort of thing) but we did try to consider it from every angle before it became clear to me she wanted me to move the brunch 

- the cookout was planned after I told her that she didn’t need to plan any birthday party for me. Basically, my mom called asking if I had plans and offered to host a cookout that day. My family has cookouts/get togethers at least twice a month, so they’re very lowkey, even if there’s a birthday happening, and also my girlfriend had been to several of the cookouts before, so my family was a little surprised she didn’t come. 

- I appreciate that y’all think our birthday buddy tradition is sweet - it has always meant a lot to me. I do want to make it clear that I’m not just doing it to make her happy - it’s something I also look forward to every year. Growing up, my aunt was the cool aunt that all the cousins wanted to hang out with, and I loved this special thing we did (and don’t worry, she does fun/special things with all my cousins and her own kids now, one of our fun/special things just happens to be our birthday.) She has never treated me like a replacement for her twin and she is in no way the AH in this situation.

1ed123d,AITAH for giving my 11 year old a small sip of coffee?,My wife and I were both raised Mormon. I left church about 4 months ago. I started drinking coffee since I no longer thought it was wrong. We agreed that the kids would not have the option to drink it until they were at least 16. My Son has often stated that he does not like the smell of coffee of the taste of the espresso jelly beans or any thing else coffee flavored. The other day I took the kids to a town fair and there was a booth with coffee trials I tasted a cup and my 11 year old was asking constantly to try a taste. I  gave him a tinny bit expecting that he would also find it gross. He enjoyed it and proceeded to tell my wife as soon as we got home before I could discuss it with her. She is very upset with me and thinks I ruined our trust.

1ec7hm9,AITA for telling off my parents for giving my young kids a hard time about speaking a foreign language in front of them?,"Burner for privacy. I am American. My wife is from a foreign country, though she did her post-secondary studies in the US.  She comes from a small country, the language of which is not widely spoken elsewhere.  Once our relationship got serious, I decided to learn her language.  I’ve always had an interest in languages and a facility for learning them (I speak two others besides English and my wife’s).  With her and her family’s help, I’ve become near-fluent!   When we had kids (twin boys, 8), we decided to raise them to speak both languages, partly so they could communicate more easily with their relatives on my wife’s side and partly as a way to keep them connected to m wife’s culture.  A few years ago, we bought a small vacation property in my wife’ country, where we spend a couple of weeks each summer, which has both helped my and my kids’ facility with the language and has in turn been made more enjoyable *because* we all speak the language.

For reasons I can’t quite get to the bottom of, this has always seemed to irritate my parents.  They were sour about the fact that some of the toasts at our wedding were in my wife’s language (we translated).  My mother, a former teacher, claimed that attempting to raise the kids bilingual risked causing language delays generally.  I told them that I appreciated their concern, but that we had done our research and felt like it would be good for the kids, but they kept bringing it up for the first few years of the kids lives, until it was clear they were both highly precocious in verbal skills. 

These days, we speak a mix of both languages at home.  The kids will often speak to each other in wife’s language, often preferentially so when they are just sorting something between themselves.  The problem is that my parents get annoyed when they hear it.  They justify it on multiple grounds, all flimsy in my view: that if they are watching the kids, they need to know what they are talking about in order to properly supervise; that they could be using it as a “secret language” to say disrespectful things; that if we allow it with them, they’ll do it at school and anger teachers or peers.  It’s never proved a problem for anyone but my parents.

Parents were over recently and one kid spoke to the other in the foreign language. I was in the other room and heard my mom gently reprove them to the effect of “it’s rude to speak in a language we can’t understand; I need to tell you this because you’re parents won’t.”  At that point I had enuogh and I stormed in and told my parents that they need to drop it.  They can have lots of 95% English time with their grandkids, or they can insist on 100% English and have 95% less time.  My dad got upset and said that they were only looking out for the kids because we have a “blind spot” about this and that I should apologize to my mother.  I rolled my eyes and said “sorry” in my wife’s language, which got a laugh out of my kids, but caused my parents to up and leave.  AITA?",Intrepid-Skill6615,1368,540,0.949999988079071,0.1304423058582023,1721945310,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ec7hm9/aita_for_telling_off_my_parents_for_giving_my/,2024,7,AmItheAsshole,2024-07-25 22:08:30

1e8y584,AITA for exploding at my friend for not feeding my dog for a week because they believed a 'water fast' was healthy?,"**Dr. Alexandra Horowitz, Animal Behaviorist and Author**

**aita for exploding at my friend for not feeding my dog for a week because they believed a 'water fast' was healthy?**

Hi everyone,

I need to vent and get some perspective on something that has me absolutely livid. I recently went on a week-long business trip and asked my friend, who I'll call Jane, to pet sit my dog, Max. Jane has always seemed responsible and claims to love animals, so I trusted her without hesitation. I left detailed, explicit instructions on Max's feeding schedule, his favorite treats, and how to take care of him. I even stocked up on his favorite food and treats to ensure there would be no issues.

When I returned, I immediately noticed something was wrong. Max was unusually lethargic, his ribs were more pronounced, and he looked generally unwell. Alarm bells went off in my head, so I confronted Jane about what had happened. To my utter disbelief, she nonchalantly told me she hadn't fed Max ANY food the entire week. Why? Because she decided to put him on a ""water fast,"" claiming she read somewhere that it's supposedly healthy for dogs.

I was absolutely horrified. Jane, who has no veterinary training or knowledge, took it upon herself to ignore my clear instructions and subjected Max to what is essentially starvation. She calmly explained that she thought she was doing him a favor by letting his system ""detox."" I couldn't contain my anger and exploded at her, screaming that what she did was incredibly dangerous and irresponsible. Jane then had the audacity to get defensive, saying I was overreacting and that her intentions were good.

I rushed Max to the vet, and thankfully, he is on the mend, but the vet confirmed that the week-long lack of food could have caused severe health issues. I'm beyond angry and feel deeply betrayed by Jane. She has since apologized, but still insists that she thought she was doing the right thing.

AITA for trusting Jane to pet sit and for exploding at her for not feeding Max? Should I have been even more explicit about not doing anything out of the ordinary with Max's care, even though I thought my instructions were clear enough?

1dx2w79,AITA for kicking my step daughter out?,"My husband and I are happily married and have one child together. He has one daughter from a previous relationship. We get along great with his ex and her husband. They weren't together long as they were lifelong friends who briefly tried dating and realized they were better as friends, even after the birth of their daughter.

Everyone gets along with the exception of their daughter, who really doesn't get along with anyone. She stayed with her aunt and when she left a couple weeks later, her cousin had to start therapy. The aunt went low contact with all of us. Her grandmother stopped having her for more than a couple days because her blood pressure can't take it.  She's been in therapy, asked if something has happened to her, but she is just defiant. She has been diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder.

Her mother and step father have started therapy because of the constant stress of having her around. We told them that of course we would have her stay with us. 

It's been miserable. She goes out of her way to do the opposite of what anyone asks her to do. Refuses to do basic chores i.e. picking up her own trash and dirty clothes. We gave her the household chore of vacuuming once a day in the three rooms that have carpet. It takes maybe fifteen minutes. We found out she ""traded"" our son then complained when she was caught that it wasn't fair he got the easier job of watering two plants. We told her that not only is he only 8 yo but he is developmentally delayed and has muscular dystrophy and can barely push the vacuum. Not only that but he's nonverbal and couldn't tell her no. He just did as he was told.

The last straw was when I went into her room to put clothes away and noticed her pile of leftover food and wrappers. Id told her multiple times it needed thrown away. I decided to do it that time because it was starting to mold and she would lose food in her room privileges. I picked it up and there were a couple roaches. We called an exterminator and he said, they were only in her room and we were lucky to find it early and it most likely happened because instead of throwing her trash away, she just threw it out the window and left the window open. 

My husband says we shouldn't have kicked her out because now resents us and feels like we are giving up on her. I said I understood that as a parent but at what point does she have to stop making all of us miserable? Besides I think the best thing is to finally make her take some responsibility for herself and despite efforts with therapy, attempted quality time, punishments, encouragements, he is just enabling her at this point. Ultimately, I purchased the house prior to marriage and it's still in my name. I refuse to have my son live with someone who will take advantage of him and live in a house with roaches and mold. My husband and I are starting therapy soon for ourselves as well because of this and she is staying with the second friend because the first made her leave.

1ed0y52,AITA for making my husband care for our baby while he has a headache?,"I (29F) and my partner (27M) have been together for seven years and have a child together, 1M. He’s about as challenging as you’d expect a one year old to be but he’s easy to play with, eats well, and sleeps well. We both work full time- him at home and me in a nonprofit. Our son goes to daycare. When we are all at home, I generally do the cooking/cleaning/childcare/waking up with baby. I occasionally ask for help with chores and childcare, with on and off success. Frequently, my partner is too busy or “doesn’t want to” (cooking, specifically), or is working out of town. Recently he even took a three week boys trip. 

I am in the final stages of applying for a job with the government. I’ve worked my butt off from freshman year in university to have this job and I am taking it extremely seriously. My next assignment is a written essay that I had less than 48 hours of notice for. I am not a quick writer and this is not my strong suit so I was hoping to get it done tonight, and that way if I needed more time I could work on it tomorrow, or the next day. 

I went to let my partner know I’d be leaving our son home while I went to the library to do the essay (I know if I stay home the baby is going to get sent into the room). He was in bed and said no, he had a headache, and needed to rest. He didn’t sleep well and had to work today. I let him know that this is extremely important to me and I don’t want to rush. He ignored me. I let him know, again, I’m leaving. He is upset with me that he is feeling awful and I am still putting the work on him. 

I’ve prepped dinner, baby literally just needs to be fed, supervised, and put to sleep. I don’t even care if they veg out and watch Bluey. But he is still sick. AITA to insist on going?

1e11a0u,AITA for expecting my adult children to babysit while on vacation?,"Next month, my family and I are going on a 10 night vacation to the Caribbean. 

There is 10 of us altogether. Myself, my eldest son (25) and his girlfriend, my eldest daughter (21) and her boyfriend, my three youngest kids (14M, 13F, 10M), my girlfriend and her daughter (5). 

I'm paying for all the main expenses of the trip (minus the flights for my son, his girlfriend, and my daughter's boyfriend).

Recently, we were discussing itinerary of the vacation. I've told the kids that half the nights would be family nights, but two nights of the vacation my adult kids and their partners can go and do their own thing. I also told them that they would be babysitting two of the nights as well, so my girlfriend and I can spend some time together away from the kids. 

There is specifically a day of the vacation I plan for the older kids to watch their siblings all day/night because I have plans for me and my girlfriend. 

My daughter wasn't very happy when I mentioned this. She accused me of being manipulative because I didn't mention the babysitting request until now. I didn't really think to mention it sooner because I didn't think it would be an issue and thought it would probably be expected. 

My daughter says she doesn't mind babysitting but doesn't like feeling like she's been forced into it because I paid for a her vacation. 

She also brought up our last family vacation out the country back in 2019 (it was just me and the five kids) and claims she spent most the vacation looking after her little siblings, and is just worried the same thing will happen again. I won't lie, she was very helpful during that last vacation as I was a single parent with 3 little kids.

I told her her things are different now, so it won't be like that last vacation.

1ec8er0,AITAH for kicking my friend out of my party when he hooked his ps5 up to my TV?,"Last weekend I (24m) threw a house warming party with 30ish of my friends. I supplied drinks and food and had games set up and what not. 

One friend came with a big backpack. Initially I said to him “oh man you didn’t have to bring anything” but then he slid a PlayStation 5 out of it. I’m not gonna lie, I was immediately ticked off… it wasn’t really a video gaming party… but I didn’t wanna control how people enjoyed themselves so I let him hook up his PlayStation and start playing. I didn’t tell him what kind of party it was besides saying house warming and approx 30 people, but I just thought he’d know I wouldn’t be on the couch with him playing ps5.

This is where I’m wondering if I’m the asshole. As the party progressed, I was getting increasingly annoyed by having him on the couch with Call of Duty blasting on the TV. Everyone else was close by to the TV talking and playing beer pong and it just kinda embarrassed me. I didn’t say anything to him though until he started to get visibly annoyed by people passing in front of the TV. I sat beside him and said “if you’d rather be home playing video games you have no obligation to be here”. He laughed it off and kept playing. A bit later I asked him to be my partner in beer pong, and he said he’d rather keep playing ps5. I kinda just turned my TV off at that point and told him to go home.

1edt84o,AITA for refusing my parents' request to be trustee for my brother's inheritance?,"Throwaway account.  Context: I (45M) have one brother (40M).   My parents (71M,F) both had successful careers and have accumulated enough wealth that they need to do estate planning.  I got very lucky and have had a lucrative finance career that has left me quite a bit wealthier than they are (which they know, roughly).  My brother and his wife both work for non-profits, but have climbed their respective org charts and have a good middle-class income.  My parents have helped them from time to time, for example with a downpayment for a house when they got married and private school tuition for my young nephew.  He’s a little more into shopping and costly hobbies  than I am – but I live an unusually spartan life. Brother and I have a good relationship, though we live on opposite sides of the country, so we only get together a few times a year. 

When my parents last visited me, they pulled me aside to tell me about their estate plans.  They intend to leave everything to my brother and his family, because I’m already financially set and because they don’t want a giant disparity in wealth between their two sons.  I’m entirely fine with that.  It’s their money, obviously; I don’t need any; and I love my brother and his family and want them to be comfortable.  I told my parents as much – so far so good.

Here's where it got problematic.  Parents said, “it’s a lot of money and we don’t want it to just drop in \[Bro’s\] lap.  So we are setting up a trust to receive the money, to benefit \[Bro\] and then \[nephew\].  We want you to be the Trustee. ”  I told them that wasn’t going to be possible.  I don’t want to superintend my brother’s finances.  It seems like a recipe for strife and division. If I just let him do what he pleases and the money is dissipated, he could resent that I didn’t invest it better or exert more control; if I am conservative about disbursements, then he could resent my “heavy hand.”   I also told them that while my bro is not quite the penny-pincher I am, he is far from irresponsible with money (or generally).

My parents reacted poorly.  They claimed that it is not a big ask.  I said that, actually, it is kind of a big ask for me to serve as Trustee for who-knows-how-long , and that the one sliver lining of getting no inheritance should be that I don’t need to be involved in the estate.  I offered to refer them to a professional trust company. They accused me of refusing out of jealousy.  That was too much for me, so I pulled out my banking app and showed them that what was just sitting in my checking account was close to their estate (to be honest, had just received a large deferred comp wire from my firm, so it was unusually large –but, look, I was annoyed at their accusation and wanted to rebut it as quickly and convincingly as possible).  When we parted, it was a little tense and my mom said, “well, I guess we were wrong to think we could count on you.”

Now I am thinking maybe I should just suck it up and do it.  AITA?",Illustrious_Ball3004,1656,249,0.959999978542328,0.1032167884570842,1722121537,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1edt84o/aita_for_refusing_my_parents_request_to_be/,2024,7,AmItheAsshole,2024-07-27 23:05:37

She’s only twelve right now (going into 7th grade this fall). She’s never really complained before about the no-dating rule, but a few nights ago she told me she was going to the movies with “a friend”. Yes, she *told me*, rather than asking if she could go. She said the friend’s sibling was dropping them off and picking them up, so I didn’t need to do anything.

I asked how long the movie was and which friend she was going with. Normally I wouldn’t have let her go (it was less than half an hour before she was supposed to leave, and I like to know plans at least a day in advance. But since it’s summer and she’s been pretty bored recently, I figured I’d let it slide).

She said the movie went past ten, and since we live pretty far from the theater she wouldn’t be home until around eleven. I asked again which friend it was (I would only trust her out this late with her best friend‘s sister, who babysat her for years). She was very vague and didn’t mention a specific name, so I told her she couldn’t go.

After complaining for a while, she caved and told me a boy she’d met had invited her and she was really looking forward to it. I reminded her of the no-dating rule (though she claimed “it’s not a date!”) and said she could go on a date with him in four years if he were still interested. I also allowed her to text him and cancel.

She cried and slammed the door to her room, saying stuff like she really likes him and was looking forward to it so much.

When my wife got home we talked about it, and she agreed that cancelling the date was the right decision.

However, a couple days later we got an angry call from the boy’s parents. (By the way, they got my number from the school listing, which is where I later found out my daughter met him). They said their son had bailed on a family event, and the least I could do was pay for another date for the two of them.

I said she couldn’t go and I was sorry, but had she told us about the date sooner I would’ve cancelled sooner. They angrily hung up.

Also, it seems like she and the boy had been texting all summer and were only planning a date now for god knows what reason.

She told me it was gross and that she didn’t want to be stepping all over my waste when she went to the bathroom. Keep in mind we live in a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom studio apartment.

1eoeahu,AITA for wearing a two piece to my kids’ swimming lessons?,"I (27f) am a mother to quadruplets aged 2. This is their first year taking swimming lessons, and, at their age, the lessons require one-one-one with the child/adult as well as an instructor to teach. So me, my husband, and two of my husbands friends came along. (Unfortunately all four of the kids got booked for the same time). They started the lessons on Monday and ended today (Friday). 

At the lessons, all the other kids had their mothers/female guardians with them, and all of them wore shorts/shirt swimsuits. My husband/his friends had trunks with no shirt, and I wore a two piece. Nothing bad, everything was well covered, but obviously my stomach and back showed. I didn’t think it was a big deal, and I honestly didn’t even notice what everyone wore until probably Wednesday. And it was fine because everybody (including me) was modest. 

However, they finished their lessons today. When everyone was getting changed to leave, a few mothers came up to me. They said they didn’t want to mention it earlier to make classes awkward, but they and a few other mothers were uncomfortable with how I was wearing a two piece to the lessons all week. The suggested if I do another class with my kids here, I cover up my stomach because nobody wants to see it Because of the stretch marks from my pregnancy. (Which is a lot more than average because I had quadruplets). I asked if they had an issue with how my husband/his friends didn’t wear a shirt at all, and they said the didn’t care because they didn’t have the “baby belly” like I did. 

Now I’m back home, and I can’t decide if they were being rude or just were honest. They made sure to tell me it wasn’t about the modesty, it was just my stomach. I never thought about it, so maybe it’s my fault for being careless and not thinking of everyone else. My husband says I was fine, but all the mothers there apparently don’t think so.

1eiorrn,AITAH telling girlfriend that she gave me the 'ick' at a family dinner? ,"I'm 32m dating my girlfriend Jenny 27f for almost a year now, and we've meet each other's families. Jenny is an only child of an asian family while I'm half/half with one younger sister, Anna 21f. Anna and I are close despite our age gap, our parents both worked demanding jobs and I would babysit/chaperone for many of her bratty teen years.

In recent months I've noticed that whenever Anna comes up in conversation, Jenny would joke about how Anna is overly spoiled by my parents and I and how we've created a princess. Last week at a family dinner with my parents I felt like Jenny was overly grilling Anna on school/dating/life. At one point, Anna was telling a story about how a first date gave her ""the ick"" by not pull out his wallet after their meal and let her foot the full meal. Jenny laughed and said that not every man will treat her to dinner like her brother would and that ""you need to lower your standards."" I was not happy with this comment as it sounded like my sister didn't deserve to be treated with basic respect but also didn't want to embarrass Jenny.

Jennifer then went on talk about how that would've never happen to her as men see her as ""high value"". I don't know what about this comment that just pissed me off but I said that she was giving ME ""the ick"" and to stop talking to my sister like that.

The argument we had when we got home was massive, and Jenny told me that I was over-reacting to an innocuous comment and would make a terrible father because I would always favor my sister over everyone else. I'm shocked at called a 'terrible father' and honestly still don't think I was wrong, but need another opinion.",Nonfrench_Fries3621,12509,1857,0.9200000166893004,0.6107132225651362,1722641959,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1eiorrn/aitah_telling_girlfriend_that_she_gave_me_the_ick/,2024,8,AmItheAsshole,2024-08-02 23:39:19
1ejeqr1,AITA for refusing to take my girlfriend home from a party after she embarrassed herself? ,"A coworker invited me to a housewarming party, he bought a really nice house with a large yard, a pool and even a waterfall flowing into the pool. I wouldn't say I'm necesarrily friends with him but we're friendly and make small talk when we see each other, we don't really hang out  by ourselves. He's a nice guy but we don't have too many interests. He told me I can bring my girlfriend. At that party I knew about 3 out of the 40 people there. 

At the party my girlfriend began complaining to me about the food options saying they don't follow her diet, she can't eat them, the host should have gotten better food, the paintings on the wall are tacky, his furniture sucks, that the music is pretty lame and a bunch of other ridiculous complaints.  We live in São Paulo at the moment but we're from a region in Southern Brazil where most people speak Hunsrik, which is a type of German, though its a bit distinct from standard German, someone from Germany wouldn't understand everything I say.

 She complained in Hunsrik, assuming that everyone at the party only knew Portuguese but my coworker was near us and he said what I guess is standard German ""I'm sorry we don't have any food that fits your dietary restrictions, if you are hungry there is a store about 400 meters from here, it closes in an hour. I'm sorry you don't appreciate the music selection would you like to play something?"" 

My girlfriend looked shock, her jaw dropped and she just stuttered for a bit, a few people snicker in the back and another guy translates what happened and she responded back in Portuguese ""how do you all know German? I had no idea"" and my coworker explains he and 3 other people in this party used to work in Germany and that's how they know each other. My girlfriend pulled me aside and said she's so embarassed and wants to go home. I told her no, I'm having a good time here and she's begging me to bring her back saying she's so embarassed and she can't handle this and I told her she shouldn't talk shit about people and she's getting what she deserved, this broke out into a screaming match. She demanded i give her the car keys and I refused. 

We stayed at the party for another 2-3 hours, she talked to some other girls but was kind of quiet. On the ride home we got into another argument where she says I should have taken her side and I unleashed a lot of my frustration onto her saying she is actually the one causing embarassment by insulting my coworker. She blamed me for not telling her he speaks German I told her that wasn'r relevant and i never thought to bring it up. (I honestly didn't know he spoke it that well, he just briefly mentioned living in Germany once at a meeting). 

so yeah was I in the wrong here?

1f3nt3w,AITA for refusing my birthday gift because it was a weight watchers subscription?,"
Hi Reddit, I turned 18 (female) yesterday but it seems to caused a bit of drama in my family so im asking for honest, objective opinions on whether im wrong. I’m using a throwaway account because this situation is obviously very humiliating for me

For reference, my weight has always been made fun of in my family. My aunt specifically has always been very unkind and fat shamed me, even when I was younger and struggling with my body image. She used to tell me that my clothes looked so small on me, and that even her clothes are probably small for me. She used to remind me to go on diets constantly. Im currently 320lbs if it adds contexts too 

I hadn’t seen my aunt in a while and for the most part I was really glad to see her for my birthday. I was slightly dreading if she would say anything to me because im aware I have gained a lot of weight since I last saw her, but she just made a few comments so I thought it was the end of it. 

I was opening a birthday card she gave me a few hours later and it had money in it, with a note that said “money for weight watchers, make some real change for once”. This was humiliating and I asked her about it and she said that she could tell I was miserable and that I probably look really good underneath the fat. She said this in front of my parents, and it was very embarrassing. I told her im not accepting the gift and she’s making me look stupid, but she said that she was just worried for me and my health. I don’t believe this, she’s made fun of my weight for years even before I was a teenager. But my parents think I was overreacting and I should’ve just accepted it. My aunt has a notoriously big mouth and my parents think she’s going to tell our whole family so they’re getting kind of worried about what I’ve done.

1el0x4d,AITA for making a dessert with my 2 year old for a potluck.,"We had a potluck at work last week.  I made this delicious brownie & cookie concoction with a caramel sauce.  When I made it, my 2 year old was by my side and ""helping"" as much as he could.  

  
When I put the dish out at the potluck I added a sign that my son helped make it.  I thought that was the right thing to do in case people had an issue with it.  A co-worker who has made it known does not like kids, She has complained to HR about my kid being around at the end of the day for 15-30 minutes.  

  
This co-worker approached me and said that it wasn't fair that I made a dish that she wouldn't eat.  I told her I just made the dish, i'm not concerned with who did and didn't eat it.  She said that making a dish that wasn't made in a safe way and bringing it is not okay. I felt like providing the sign was enough to allow people to make their own decisions.   She called me an asshole and I felt like she was blowing this way out of proportion.  But AITA?  ",Secret-Departure1215,8701,1619,0.9200000166893004,0.4461754138741369,1722896235,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1el0x4d/aita_for_making_a_dessert_with_my_2_year_old_for/,2024,8,AmItheAsshole,2024-08-05 22:17:15
1esdw0m,AITA for telling my siblings I don’t want to split the bill equally since they have kids and I don’t?,"I have two older sisters (both over 30 years old), while I’m still in my 20s. The thing is, they suggested to invite my mom to lunch for Mother’s Day and they were talking about splitting the expenses in 3 parts. Both of them have 2 kids each while I don’t. Given past (bad) experiences where the kids were not contemplated in the bill but still would eat I told them I did not like the idea of splitting in 3 since their kids should be taken into account, mind you, the kids are not babies, one of them will soon turn 18. At the mention of that they did not like it and called me confrontational and my mom even found out and took their side, as per usual.  

To give you some more context as to why it bothers me: A similar experience happened before during a trip where I had to pay a third out of all the expenses, my mom another and my sister another (husband and kids included). She thought my mom and I were oblivious about the whole thing but my mom begged me to not say anything to not start a fight but now I think I’ve held my silence for long.

So, the question is, AITA for wanting the bill to be split differently considering I don’t have kids and I’m only paying for my share and my mom’s?

1f206bz,AITA for making my son (16) pay for his own room?,"I'm a single mom of 5 (16M, 14M, 10M, 9F, 7M) renting a 3-bedroom house.

Up until 2 months ago the 2 eldest boys shared a room, the 3 youngest shared, and I had the smallest room. 

For the last few years my eldest complained non-stop about having to share a room with his little brother. Most of his friends’ parents are wealthy so he's constantly comparing our situation to theirs. 

He started working when he was 14 (a few hours a week) for a little extra money, now at 16 he works a lot (more than I would like) and this summer he has been working basically fill-time. He's not too bad with his money and actually saves some of it, but the rest goes to video games, clothes/shoes, and junk food. 

2 months ago, my son and I were discussing his distaste for sharing a room with his brother and he said he'd drop out of school now if it meant he could move out into his own space. I told him I had looked at 4-bedroom rentals in our area, but they were just too expensive. He asked if he could pay the difference if we did move. I told him no because during the school year all his money would be going to rent not his savings and his spending money. That obviously wouldn't sit right with me.

However, we did come up with a compromise. For $50 a month he could have my bedroom and my 10-year-old could move in with 14-year-old and I would sleep in our living room (our couch is already a pull-out). This was 2 months ago, and we already made the switch, and everybody is happy with the new set up. 

All the money my son is paying me is going straight into my Christmas savings and then after Christmas will go into a summer trip savings. 

I recently told some of my friends what I was doing and they're against it. They think I'm wrong for taking any amount of money from my kids and a couple of them said I should have just given him the room without making him pay for it. They make some good points, and I don't totally disagree, and it makes me feel like an asshole.

My 14-year-old son is also unhappy about the arrangement, he thinks its unfair older brother is getting his own room and that middle brother should have stayed in his old room. I can see how he feels it's unfair that older brother has the chance to pay for his own room when he (or the other kids) don’t have the same opportunity.

It seems bad to renege with my oldest now, but I'm not sure if I made a mistake agreeing to this.

1eu2nsl,AITA for being picky and not eating the food my husband bought for me?,"I’m really frustrated with how my husband handles my food preferences. He constantly says that I don’t like anything and gets upset when I can’t eat certain things. It’s not that complicatedI generally can’t stand spicy, ""sweet and sour"" (like in Chinese food, i dont like sweetness in my main dish) or acidic foods.I also hate raw tomatoes and calamari. I always cook and at restaurants there is always something I can enjoy.  That’s basically all he needs to remember. I dont think I am too picky. He says it’s difficult because of the exceptions, like I only like pineapple and oranges when they’re sweet. I can discern if they will be sweet or acidic, so I can choose when to buy them. But what’s so hard about that? If they’re not sweet, they’re acidic, and I don’t like acidic food.

His bosses recently offered to buy something for me when they were out, and my husband chose sweet and sour chicken that usually I dont like. But one time I mentioned that there was an exception for a certain restaurant. This time, the dish was both spicy and sour. I tried to eat it because he had already bought it, but I just couldn’t. He got mad and told me to throw it out then.

To clarify: I don't like sweetness in my main dish. So, no sugar, lime or too much spicy in my dishes. And I have told him this literally many times.

1eoeupa,AITA For Not Letting My Wife Have Some Of My Earnings From A Business Of Which She Wanted No Part?,"My wife and I had discussed my starting a business for a few years. I was under the impression we would be partners in the business. When the time came, I needed my wife's signatures on a few pieces of paperwork. She was adamant she wanted absolutely nothing to do with the business. In fact, those were her literal words: ""I want nothing to do with this business. It is entirely your project"" and she was quite angry about it. So, I took on other partners.

Well, the business has since become profitable and she has recently been making plans for the use of the money I make from the business as if it were her own. I told her (paraphrasing) ""This money is my money. It is not yours. It is in a separate account with only my name on it. You said you wanted nothing to do with the business and said it was entirely my project."" This pissed her off.

My wife also found out I altered my will to leave my share of the business and the money in the aforementioned account to my business partners and not her. She is now livid because it means, if I die before her, she will end up with only the assets we had from before I started running the business full-time and the money she made while working.

1eodjv2,"AITA for letting my daughter wear whatever she is comfortable in, in my house?","Okay, this requires some important details. First, I am a (37M). My ex wife, ""Deanna"" (36F) and I have 2 kids, our daughter ""Jane"" (12F) and our son ""Eddie"" (10M). We got married semi young at 23 and 24, we divorced amicably five years ago. 

Deanna recently married a man she has been seeing for a few years, who I will call ""A."" Something I need to bring up here is that I am half Mexican, Deanna is a white woman, and A is of Middle Eastern descent. While I wouldn't say A and I are friends, I do think he's a pretty nice guy, and seems like a really good match for Deanna. The kids also like him, so that's another bonus in my book.

Deanna and I split custody of the kids. HOWEVER.  Deanna and A got married two months ago. Since then, Deanna has chosen to wear a covering, which I am sorry but the name slips my mind. She converted to A's religion as well. Which, I'm very happy about if that's what she wants. But last week, when she dropped off the kids, I was surprised to see that Jane was wearing one as well. But, I assumed she must have wanted to wear it and was maybe deciding to convert her faith as well, so I didn't bring it up. I feel that she's old enough to decide for herself, and as an atheist myself, I'm all for my children choosing what they believe

A few days ago, I was going to go see a movie with my kids but told them I had to finish some paperwork in my office first, which took about half an hour. When I walked back into the living room, Jane was wearing one of Eddie's t shirts and a pair of shorts. We had a conversation which kind of went like this:


Me: what's going on? Jane, are you supposed to take off your covering? (I don't really know how any of it works, sorry if that offends anyone)

Eddie: she hates wearing that  stuff. So I let her borrow some of my clothes.

Jane: yeah dad, I hate it. Mom makes me wear it. She says I have to wear it all the time, even at your house.

Me: so, you aren't choosing to wear it?

Jane: no. I never want to wear it again.


I checked her bag, and sure enough, it contained tank tops underwear, and the coverings (which cover the hair and body, but not the face.) I took the kids on a quick target trip before the movie to get Jane some clothes of her liking. Two days ago, when Deanna came by to pick up the kids, she flipped out on Jane for not wearing the traditional clothing. Deanna and I got into a heated argument, and I told her that Jane shouldn't HAVE TO wear the covering if she doesn't want to, especially because it's very hot in our city. Deanna argued that she and the kids are now different amd follow a stricter religion,
  I might be the a-hole because I argued back that it is stupid that the religion would force young girls to cover up so much all the time and  be so strict about it. Deanna took offense, and left with the kids. I feel bad because I don't want to insult a while country or countries but I don't think my daughter should have to wear anything she doesn't want to.

One is right outside the main living space, the other is in our bedroom and then we have a half bath in the utility hall.

Not only can I sometimes hear him pooping, but it's the only bathroom with an actual bathtub and we give the kids baths after dinner. I don't want to listen to my husband poop and then do baths in a stinky poop smelling bathroom when there are literally two other bathrooms he can use.

1elx9uy,AITA for telling my husband we can get a new babysitter if he finds a better one for the same price ,"My husband and I have 3 kids (10, 8, 5). We’ve had the same babysitter, Amelia (20) for almost 5 years. Amelia has filled a few different roles for us. She was our date night sitter, then during the pandemic she was our nanny, went back to date nights, and now she gets to our house at 7:15 every morning, gets the kids out the door, drops them off at school or camp, then twice a week she babysits at night so we can run errands or get some time to ourselves. 

Amelia’s “sweet spot” was 2022-2023. She had her car and license, had games and activities planned for everyone, was always on time and prepared, and was generally more available and focused. She’s still good now but doesn’t always come with crafts and activities, can be 5-10 minutes late, and more often than not orders DoorDash for herself to our house. It’s all manageable and she still knows and loves our kids and she’s very affordable. 

The final straw for my husband was when Amelia told us that she had recently been diagnosed with autism and that she thinks our 8 year old should get an assessment, as they are exactly alike. I never would’ve known Amelia is autistic but I’m definitely willing to get an assessment. My husband saw it as rude and thinks she shouldn’t have brought it up unless we asked. 

He thinks it’s time to get a new sitter so I told him we can get a new sitter if he can find someone just as good as Amelia for the same rate as her. He says we can afford better than Amelia so we can spend more and get someone that will be focused on their work like Amelia used to be before she started college and got another job.

It started during the pandemic when she and her husband needed help balancing work-from-home and childcare, and I was happy to step in. I didn’t expect any payment at first because, well, family.

But now things are back to normal. She’s back at work full-time, and I’m also busy with my job and personal life. Despite this, she’s still asking me to babysit at least once a week, sometimes more. The issue is, she never offers to pay me or even says a simple “thank you.” It’s just expected that I’ll do it.

Last week, I finally told her I can’t keep doing this for free, and if she wants me to babysit, she either needs to pay me or at least express some gratitude. She got really upset, saying I was being selfish and that family should help each other out without expecting anything in return.

I get that family helps family, but I feel taken advantage of. I’m not asking for much, just a token of appreciation or even an occasional break. Now she’s not speaking to me, and our parents are saying I should apologize to keep the peace.

1eu0vfs,"AITA for going off on my parents after they make me pay for my portion of a family dinner (when they payed for everybody else), despite them taking half my paycheck?","I’m 17F right now, and the middle child of my family. I’m at an age where I’m able to care for myself, but my parents take it to an absurd degree. So, just so I can pay for what I need, I have a job. However, they take half my earnings and say it’s because “they’re my parents, they deserve it”. That, plus me having to pay for my phone bill, leaves me with a rather small amount of money for me to have.

The other night, my family took me and my sisters out for dinner, since my older sister could come down from her college. We all eat, and have a generally good time until the check comes. My parents decided to pay for everybody **but** me. I had to pay for myself. So, naturally, I ask my parents about it. From there, the conversation escalates into a full-blown argument, which ends in them saying that I’m kicked out of the house. I say fine, and go to stay at a friend’s house for the night, hoping they didn’t mean it and will cool off by the next day.

The next day, I received a text from them saying that I needed to pick my things up from the house. I go to the house, and find all my stuff sitting on the front porch packed up. They were serious about their threat. My friend, being very nice, decided to let me stay at their house for the time being, until either I’m allowed back home, or I find someplace else.

It was also the day that I received my paycheck (it was resent since the first one bounced). When I go to get it, I find that my parents have cashed the WHOLE paycheck, not just the usual half they do. This obviously gets me more pissed off, and I go off on my parents again. They say that they’re going to disown me, which considering what they just did, makes me believe they actually will.

So AITA?

Edit for clarification: When I was young, my family was under financial stress, so me and my sister had to work to help out.

1emr3xf,AITA for ‘blindsiding’ my roommates after moving out?,"I 23F share a flat with Sara 24F and Vera 24F. Rent in our city is very expensive and all of us can only affording living here by renting a 3bed flat as we couldn’t by ourselves or in a 2 bed flat. 

Me and Vera were single when we moved in last year and Sara had a boyfriend Jake 26M.  Jake is clean, quiet and pays part of our utilities as he comes over most nights. 

Vera has recently started dating Oli 23M who is a friend of Jake and Sara’s. Oli has made a few weird comments about me- he pestered me about my weight and told me he could bench me and also asked me some weird sexual questions. When I flagged this to Vera, (I’ve never met Oli) she said he’s just trying to be friends. Sara and Jake said it was just his sense of humour.

Last week, me and Vera had a big fight after I overheard Vera and Oli in the shower together. We have one bathroom in the house, and my bedroom shared a wall, so I heard them having sex. They also didn’t clean the shower afterwards, and Sara stayed at her parents that week, so I ended up cleaning the shower.

I brought up this issue to Sara, who isn’t confrontational and said now that I’ve brought it up to Vera she knows how I feel and won’t do it again- but she didn’t at all find it as weird as I did. Since then I have avoided Oli/Vera and kept to myself.

I am not really friends with Vera anymore, and Sara remains neutral which favours Vera so I was thinking of moving out. We had all signed on for the next year as our contract renews in September, before I met Oli, and my estate agency said I couldn’t get out unless the contract had been violated. 

I just live in that house now, I’m on awkward terms with the other two, so I read the contract and one of the clauses says only declared tenants can stay for extended periods of time, so I reported that Vera has her boyfriend over, and proved it as the utilities went up in the time I said.

This got me out the contract, however the landlord is evicting Sara and Vera because of this. They said I blindsided them and they will struggle to find a place by the end of this month. My parents live 1.5 hours away so I am moving in with them, but the other two are from a different city so can’t do the same.

1et9pki,AITA For Not Buying My Fiance A Second Wedding Dress That's More than 50% The Total Budget?,"Throwaway Account  
  
My (F49) fiancé (F32) wants me to buy her a new wedding dress that’s over 50% the total wedding budget after I already bought her a $8,600 dress.

I’m marrying the love of my life who is a member of a Native American tribe and lives on a reservation in my city.

I was involved with this tribe before I met her, buying an older woman a mobile home to put on her land when her daughter went to prison leaving her three grandkids to raise when she was living in a 15’ travel trailer. She managed to get the kids out of foster care due to this.

This greased the wheels to get the council to approve us having our wedding on the reservation. I’m paying for everything and have a $60,000 budget. There will be traditional dancers, drummers, and a traditional feast all catered by women on the reservation.  We have an 80 person guestlist—the only people coming on my side is my mother and my adult nephew.

Yes, I’m spreading my money around on the reservation, trying not to be obnoxious about it. Like I said, I’ve seen the poverty many of them go through and I love that my wedding is bringing money there.

My fiancé said she dreamed of her wedding since she was a little girl. I could care less about weddings, tbh, so I’ve let her be the only ‘bride’.  I’m going to wear a black gown with tuxedo elements on top to kind of stand in as a ‘groom’. This way all the attention will be on her. My only rule was that the budget was $60,000 FIRM, not a penny more, and I hired a wedding planner she had to work with to get everything within that budget.

She went out with her girlfriends and decided on a beautiful $8,600 dress. She loved it. It was purchased and fitted. Great.

It’s three months until the wedding (we’re doing November because it’s way too hot to have a summer wedding out here).  She was continuing to get things ready with the tribe and the planner.  One of the tribal elders brought up her dress.  He said she should wear a traditional tribal gown made by one of their artisans.

She sat me down to tell me something ‘serious’ and explained that she couldn’t wear the gown she bought. She needed a traditional tribal gown. I said to get a quote from the artisan and maybe we could get a partial return and/or sell the other gown to cover it.

The artisan’s price? $33,000!! It’s going to be covered with beadwork and she needs to get started NOW.

I said, well it’s a good thing we already have a gown. She said she would not humiliate herself and dishonor her tribe by wearing the wrong gown. I said I can’t approve this cost. It would throw the budget out the window. She says I have millions of dollars, and this is our wedding and I’m being ridiculous.

Yes, I have money. I live off 4% as someone semi-retired. I have this money because I KEEP TO THE BUDGETS I SET.

Now she’s not talking to me except to remind me every day that if the artisan doesn’t start now, she won’t have a dress.

I don’t know what to do. Am I being the asshole here?

He says that through the shirt you can still see them jiggling and the nipple. I said that's insane that I'm supposed to wear a bra just because someone is coming into the house that's a stranger especially because I was fully covered by my shirt there was 0 cleavage showing.

Lunch time came, and as we both were walking to the staff lounge to heat up our food, she started telling me that the vet called and told her the pet’s condition and that her pet would be okay. She was telling me all this in our language. As we entered the staff lounge, a few of our coworkers were there. My sister just about to be done with her explanation when one of our coworkers intervened and said “English only.” I was taken aback by that comment and I asked “why?” She said that it’s because she couldn’t understand what we were saying.

So my(f20) best friend(f22) moved in with me recently because she broke up with her babydaddy, and she needed some time to get back on her feet. I told her she can move in with me if she pays half the rent. She has twins about a year and a half old. I do not get along with her ex at all. He cheated on her multiple times, has no sense of fatherhood hasn’t been there or contributed at all in the twins’ lives. Tried to cheat on her WITH ME, and tried to fight my boyfriend when i rejected him for obvious reasons. Basically my only rule is that the bd is not to be in the apartment because i don’t trust him. He is also known for stealing. 

I left with my mother today around 10am to help clean her house and told my friend I wouldn’t be back until the evening. My mom got tired doing yard work around 1:30pm and she said to call it a day and she took me home early. I come home to see her bd on the couch. My friend comes running out begging for forgiveness that its just for a little bit that he wants to see the babies, he wants to try to work things out. I was like cool. Get out. Go to a hotel or something you know the rules. Im going to the bank, if he’s still here when i come back you can pack your things too bc im over it. She cried really hard to forgive her shes just in a bad spot and doesn’t know what to do. I told her i don’t mind what her decisions are, but i don’t want him in the apartment it was my only rule. You didn’t even try asking me. I went to the bank and they left before i got back. I feel bad for making her cry. Maybe i should have been more calm? I didn’t yell or anything i was just really annoyed (think stern). I still am. AITA for how i went about it? If any extra context is needed, i will happily share!

1el1gdf,AITA for ‘excluding’ my BIL’s girlfriend at my anniversary dinner?,"


I 29F and my husband Dan 27M invited close friends and family for dinner and with their kids our guest list was ~30. Most our friends are in long term relationships and we are friends with their partners, but my BIL Sam wanted asked us if he could bring her girlfriend Rose of 1 month to the anniversary dinner. We met Rose once at my In-laws two weeks ago, and I don’t know her well, but I didn’t want BIL to feel excluded at the event as we had invited other SO’s so we said yes. 

Before dinner, we played a quiz where the questions were on us as a couple, some inside jokes and about friends who were there. My MOH made me a video of some recordings from our wedding, and she had contacted other people from our wedding and they had recorded themselves wishing us a happy anniversary. Sam and Rose left earlier than everyone- but we didn’t think this was unusual as Sam mentioned he was working the next day and he was going to leave earlier.

Sam sent my husband a text to say Rose felt excluded at the dinner and it was really awkward for her so they left earlier. He said we could have included her a bit more and the quiz and wedding video was awkward for her and she didn’t understand the quiz jokes and she didn’t come to the wedding.

1f0hhvj,AITA for refusing to buy a bridesmaid's dress until I get closer to my goal weight?,"My (28F) sister “Bri” 29F is getting married a year from now. Recently, she reached out to ask me to be a bridesmaid. I was surprised because Bri and I aren’t super close, but I was happy to be a part of her special day.

I used to be extremely overweight, and last year I decided to take control of my health and lost 75 pounds. I’m much happier and healthier than I was, but I’d still like to lose another 60. This became complicated when Bri sent us a link to the dress she wanted us to buy. I’ve never been a bridesmaid, but apparently it is common for brides to ask their bridesmaids to buy their own dress. Still, the dress she requested costed $300, which seemed pricey to me. Bri has asked us to order the dress within a couple of weeks, as it’s popular and she’s worried it will sell out.

I called Bri and told her I am on a weightloss journey and am not buying clothes, until I get closer to my goal weight unless they’re from Goodwill or Walmart or something. Bri seemed really upset by this–she asked if I could just purchase the size I am now and have it be loose at the wedding. I told her I plan on being almost 60 pounds lighter by the wedding, so the dress won’t be loose–it will literally fall off. Bri asked then if I could slow down my weight loss until after the wedding so the dress would fit. I told her absolutely not. I feel amazing and I’m already losing at a slow and steady pace.

I presented Bri with three solutions: 1–I can wait to buy the dress until closer to the wedding, as I requested, 2–she can buy me the dress now with her money, or 3–I drop out of the bridal party, since she probably has people she’s closer with than me anyway. Bri did not seem keen on any of these options–even removing me from the bridal party. She told me I was ruining her big day and that it’s about her, not me, so why does it matter if I wear a dress that’s a little loose?

I hung up after that to give Bri some time to cool off, but then I got a call from my mother telling me what a horrible sister I was and how selfish I was for not just ordering the bridesmaid’s dress. She reiterated how it’s Bri’s day, not mine, and when I have my own wedding I can do things exactly how I want.

To be truthful, I am finally starting to feel confident and to like how I look. Before I started losing weight, I wouldn’t have cared if I wore a too-loose dress because I was “fat and ugly” anyway. Now, even though I only buy dirt-cheap clothes, I make sure to buy clothes that flatter me and accentuate my curves. I put a lot more effort into hair, makeup, and overall presentation. So yes, even though it is not my wedding, this will probably be the first formal event I go to after having lost weight, and I know lots of pictures will be taken. I want to look my best for these photos because I know I will look back on them and remember how hard I worked to get there.

1f5yrxy,AITA for making my neighbours think I’m in a cult ,"

Hi throw away account cause I don’t want my friends to find this. I (24M) am a huge fan of board games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons. I host weekly D&D sessions at my apartment with a group of friends, and it's been our tradition for the last five years. We get into it—we dress up, light candles, chant dramatic incantations, we play some ambient music.I know it’s more that the regular player but we like it and find it funny 

Recently, my neighbors (an older couple in their 60s) moved in next door. They’re nice enough, but pretty old-school. Anyway, they’ve been giving me these weird looks lately and avoiding me in the hallway, which I thought was odd. But I figured maybe they just weren’t into socializing.

Well, last Saturday, during one of our sessions, we got *really* into it. My friend Dave (23M) was doing an epic monologue as the evil sorcerer we were about to defeat, and I may have been waving around a fake sword while wearing a hooded cloak, I was cosplaying my rouge character. We were deep in the moment when I heard a knock on the door. 

I opened it, still in costume, and was greeted by my very concerned-looking neighbors. Before I could say anything, the wife blurted out, “We’ve seen the people coming and going, the chanting, the cloaks, the swords—we just want to make sure everything is...okay?”

I was caught off guard and, without thinking, I blurted out, “Oh, we’re just summoning demons. Nothing to worry about!” And then I laughed because, obviously, I was joking.

They did not laugh. In fact, they looked even more horrified. They just mumbled something about being good Christians and backed away slowly.

Fast forward to the next morning, and I find a pamphlet slipped under my door for a “cult deprogramming service.” They even included a handwritten note offering to introduce me to their pastor “to save my soul.”

Now, my friends think this is hilarious and keep suggesting we lean into it, like start wearing robes to take out the trash or chant in the hallways. I’m honestly tempted to mess with them a bit, but I’m also kind of worried I’ve legitimately freaked them out.

Well I read the book and though I didn't think it was bad by any means, a lot of it just wasn't for me, and I thought it was pretty flawed In a lotta ways. I thought the romance in the book was terribly written, there were missed opportunities for things that could've been really fun, and I hated the ending!

I told all this to her and she was shocked! She accused me of not actually reading the book, to wich I mentioned several scenes from the book ones I enjoyed snd ines I didn't to show her I did in fact read it. 

She was very upset and asked how I could possibly not love the book and even asked if maybe I was mad at her and telling her I hated the book to be mean. I of course told her that I wasn't mad at her I just didn't like the book that much.

She was still very upset and left saying she needed to be alone for s but.

we’re more than likely going to pick the 2 bedroom but his mother is complaining about his daughter not having a room. my thing is she won’t be here full time for her to have a room of course we’ll get her own bed and toys to be put in her brother or sister room, my boyfriend loves his daughter but she won’t be living with us. eventually maybe when we’re married we’ll get her a room but right now she lives with her mother full time so it’s no sense in getting a ugly house for a room that’ll barely get used.

1ejg3f2,AITAH for asking a random girl to sleep with my friend?,"Hii, bare with me on this one.

So I(22F), my partner and six other friends are vacationing around Europe right now. One of our friends, let's say Eren, is still a virgin (22M). I don't care about it, lol, but he is very frustrated regarding this matter. 

So two days ago we were in Budapest clubbing in our hostel when this girl approaches me and my boyfriend and two other friends. She introduces herself (solo traveler), and we invite her to stay with us. Eren is somewhere else. During the night she points at one of my friends, who's in q relationship, and asks whether he s taken or not. I tell her he is and she goes ""I'm not even going to bother, I only like having sex with inexperienced guys"". This girl is physically pretty and fun to be around so I point out Eren and tell her she should hit him up in those case.

We left this morning and two hours ago Eren came humming at me. Apparently he and this girl slept together and texted over the day and she said something along the lines ""glad x told me your a greenie;))""

He is very very mad at me for talking about his private life with strangers (which I swear I did not indent to do), and for making someone to ""pity him"" to have sex.

My boyfriend sides with me (not the most objective source), and so does another of my girl friends, but the rest of the group is being neutral/defensive and kind of ignore me.

AITAH? 

Edit: Thank you for your insight. I do understand where I was wrong and hopefully I will be able to fix this with Eren. That begin said, to bring some more clarification, he never said that he wants to save himself for someone important, wants a meaningfully connection etc. I obviously don't know what happened between them and what she said, but in the morning he stated that he ""finally kicked the ball inside the net"" (it sounds weird translated, lol, but it's a local saying) with a pretty girl. Didn't sound attach or anything, but I wouldn't really know, obviously 

Edit 2: The reason I did not go to Eren in the first place (I'm not saying it's a good reason, but that was what I thought atp) is that he is not peroxide social and has a hard time talking to both men and women. He is shy and I don't think he would have made the first move. But again, I do know I am in the wrong and I will apologize to him as soon as he will want to talk to me again.",Ok-Combination-8439,2177,777,0.8999999761581421,0.1359233230900716,1722724972,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ejg3f2/aitah_for_asking_a_random_girl_to_sleep_with_my/,2024,8,AmItheAsshole,2024-08-03 22:42:52

1enjb1v,"AITA for hosting a family friendly BBQ that didn't welcome certain ""family members""","My wife and I finally bought our first house after 10+ years in an apartment.  I hosted a housewarming BBQ for friends and family.  My wife is 5 months pregnant so we weren't about to have a rager. She wants to not be pregnant when we host one of those.  For this party though, we told everyone that this would be a family friendly party.  All ages were welcome.

  
The day of the BBQ, our guests started showing up. For a bit, I was running around with my head cut off and so it took me a while to actually greet everyone.  During this time, my wife came and got me and told me that my buddy Dave brought their dog.  My wife does not like dogs.

    
I go to Dave and his wife, greet them and then I ask why he brought his dog.  He cited the family friendly party and the dog is literally his family. I was told by my wife I just stared at him for a good 10 seconds.  I was processing what he said because I found it a bit crazy. 

  
 I told him what I meant by family, was to bring your human family. I told him it was incredibly rude to assume my house and yard was pet friendly.   So I told him to take the dog home and come back.  He got pissed at me and told me that I needed to specify that some family members were excluded.   I called him crazy for thinking that. He said it was a shame that I was being an asshole because my backyard is great for a dog.  He left and didn't come back. 

  
My friends told me it was unnecessary to kick him out.  I didn't kick him out, i kicked the dog out.  They said the dog is super friendly and well trained and wasn't bothering anyone.  I told everyone I don't care if its the best dog in the world, its not welcome.  AITA?",AmIWrong324956293,2198,552,0.949999988079071,0.1220506262601186,1723156128,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1enjb1v/aita_for_hosting_a_family_friendly_bbq_that_didnt/,2024,8,AmItheAsshole,2024-08-08 22:28:48
1evlsno,AITA for standing my ground and not letting my suite-mate take my dorm room?,"For context: Our college randomly assigns suites and rooms to students that apply for dorming. It is not chosen by the students, only the buildings and who they wish to room with. I (19y/o male) am moving to college in the fall. I am in the process of getting to know my suite-mates and roommate since I chose to do random assignment because I had applied late to college and everyone already chose roommates I had to go with first bed open. After I had been assigned a room my actual roommate added me and we began talking. However, he soon blocked me and I could no longer contact him. A week after this happened my suite-mates got in contact with me. They added me and we talked. They then asked me if I happened to know my roommate since he was the only one they hadn’t talked with yet. I said yes but after we talked a bit he blocked me. We then all had the assumption that he would no longer be dorming with us hence the need to block me on instagram. So after much discussion thats the best answer we could come up with as to why he did so. I thought that was the end of that discussion but it seems I would be wrong. One of my suite-mates, lets name him Phineas, would later tell us that we should vote on who got the room. I being confused asked him why since I got the room fair and square by it being assigned to me. He said that he wasn’t aware that the rooms were assigned and that even if they were, we should vote on who gets it anyways since he wanted it. I told him no for a second time and wanted to be over with it. He then told me that he had a girlfriend and that I could understand right? No. I get that shes going to visit every now and then and that it would be nice to have some privacy, especially if they were going to do spicy things, but I already told him that I wanted the room since it was assigned to me and that if he wanted a single he should’ve booked a single. He keeps pushing the matter when I shut him down every time. I told him that if he continues to talk about it, I would go to RA and get in contact with the school about the whole situation and how Phineas wanted to violate explicit rules and guidelines of living in the dorms. For more context: our college does not allow the opposite sex to enter the bedrooms of the student and may only stay in the common area with the suite door open to the hallway. This was a strict rule that even adheres to parents and family. The guy called me a dick and said that I don’t even need it since I am single and would never understand it. My other suite-mate, gonna name him Ferb for the memes, thinks we should see who needs the room more and give it to them.

1ewgfdh,AITA for cleaning out the medicine cabinet?,"I (57 yo male) have been married to my wife (52 yo female) for 30 years. Today, while my wife was at work, I decided to clean out the medicine cabinet. I noticed that there were a lot of medications that were expired and lots of repeats. For example, we had 4 bags of cough drops, 3 bottle of Ibuprofen, etc. I decided to throw away the expired medications and throw away the extras. As I did so, I made a video of the process and pointed out the expiration dates on all of the medications and pointed out the repeats. I videoed myself throwing these items away and explained calmly why these medications needed to be monitored more closely in the future. The video was about 3 minutes long. I then sent the video to my wife so that she could see what I did. I was surprised when she called me back, very upset, asking why I hated her so much. She accused me of trying to shame her and said she couldn't understand why I was being so hateful. She told me that if I had been so concerned about our medication cabinet that I should have been monitoring it on a daily or weekly basis and that if I was that concerned about cleaning out the medicine cabinet, I would have just done it without making a shame video. I told her that I was not attempting to shame her, but rather to inform her. She told me that she showed the video to some of her coworkers, and they agreed with her that I was the asshole.

1ep6q7v,AITA for not allowing my adopted son to choose the movie on family movie night?,"I (45M) have four sons: three biological (17M, 15M, 12M) and one adopted (13M). We adopted Jake, our youngest, when he was 3 years old. He came from a really difficult background, and we’ve always tried to give him as much love and support as possible. But if I’m being honest, it hasn’t been easy.

Jake has always been more of a challenge compared to my other boys. He’s extremely sensitive and gets upset over the smallest things. Due to the trauma he experienced early on, Jake is mentally and emotionally more like an 8- or 9-year-old, even though he’s 13. This isn’t because of any special needs; it’s just the result of what he’s been through. When he was younger, he struggled a lot in school, to the point where he was eventually expelled from his primary school for behavioural issues. It was a really tough time for our family. We ended up enrolling him in a SEMH (Social, Emotional, and Mental Health) school, which costs around £70k per year. While the school has helped him somewhat, Jake still causes a lot of problems. The school often calls us because Jake’s had a meltdown or couldn’t handle something, and it’s clear he needs a lot more attention than our other kids.

At home, Jake’s neediness can be overwhelming. He’s constantly seeking reassurance and gets upset if things don’t go exactly his way. My wife has always been very patient with him, maybe too patient, in my opinion. She tends to cater to his needs a lot more than the other boys, and I can see it’s starting to wear on them. I can tell they’re starting to feel like Jake gets special treatment.

Earlier today, during our usual Saturday family movie night, this issue came to a head. We always vote on the movie to keep things fair. The older boys and I wanted to watch the first Avengers movie. When we voted, Jake was the only one who wanted to watch Spider-Verse instead. Jake loves Spider-Verse, and we’ve watched it several times before.

Seeing how upset Jake was getting, my wife suggested that we just watch Spider-Verse to avoid a meltdown. She felt it wasn’t worth the fight and wanted to keep the peace, especially considering how sensitive Jake is. But I felt like it wasn’t fair to the other boys who had won the vote fairly. I said no, we’re sticking to the movie that won the vote. Jake, predictably, got really upset, stormed off to his room, and refused to come back downstairs.

After the movie, my wife and I had a huge argument. She said I was being too ""harsh"" and that I don’t understand how difficult things are for Jake because of his past. She thinks I should have just let him have his way to avoid the conflict, but I’m tired of walking on eggshells and constantly giving in to Jake at the expense of the other boys.  I don’t think it’s right to let Jake dictate everything just because he’s more sensitive.

AITA for not letting my adopted son choose the movie on family movie night, even though it upset him and led to a huge argument with my wife?

1f59eht,AITA for leaving a family gathering after Mother & Father-in-law allowed their neighbour to make a racist comment?,"I (M 31) am mixed race (Black dad/white Mum) and am currently visiting my mum (60s) and her partner of 10 years (60s white) who we will call 'John'

My mum and John live in a small village in Wales, all white but something I'm fairly used to growing up in predominantly white areas of the UK.

Today I was de-weeding the front garden to help out while visiting, when John bumped into one of the neighbours (Karl 60s) and called me over to introduce myself/say hi. In the very first conversation, I mentioned I'm here for a week from London. Karl immediately led into a story of how when he was last in London he accidentally bumped into a man who proceeded to be extremely hostile and ignored all pleas that it was an accident, becoming more and more belligerent, before adding ""and he was coloured"" in a tone that lowkey screamed ""he was a dangerous n----r"", which both Karl & John chuckled at.

Caught off guard by the comment I immediately said I'm going to finish up on the garden, doing another 30 seconds of work, before putting the tools away and heading to my room. Shortly after John came to my room saying ""Sorry about Karl, he just says it how it is"" which led to me exploding saying ""You don't care about what he said because it doesn't matter to you but it matters to me, and you should care about that"" before leaving to go on a long hike.

Returning a couple of hours later, my mum came to my room in an attempt to resolve the situation.

It didn't go well. Mother began by telling me I'm blowing it out of proportion, that Karl is a weirdo and I should ignore his comments. I made it clear I don't care about Karl, I care that John allowed their neighbour to make a racist remark in front of me with zero pushback.

Mum told me I should have spoken up, I should have stood up for myself. I replied this is your friend, it's not my responsibility to correct them, and as a person of colour it is not my responsibility to educate every racist white person.

My Mum told me I'm overreacting, to which I told her she's white, she has no idea the experience of being a person of colour, & has no business telling me what is or isn't racist, or how I should feel. I've been forced to turn a blind eye to racism in my social life, in the workplace, in education & while working abroad, I am not going to accept racism in a place I call home, and that I'm packing my bag and going home tomorrow morning.

My mum is furious I'll be missing seeing the rest of the family, and believes I'm immature for not continuing to discuss the matter as a family and at least find a place to agree to disagree. I don't know what more there is to discuss, I don't know what compromise or level of racism I'm expected to tolerate, or how I'm supposed to be comfortable in the knowledge that my direct family are comfortable ignoring racism and minimalise my feeling towards it.

But the wedding requires women and girls to wear dresses so she will have to wear one to the wedding.

She rejected it and said "" I don't wanna wear a stupid dress ""! I then told her it was required to attend the wedding and if she didn't wear a dress we would have to leave her with a babysitter while the rest of the family went to the wedding.

1f3ob84,AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding because she didn’t invite me to hers?,"
So, some background: My sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. We’re not super close, but we’ve always managed to stay cordial, mainly because of family gatherings and events. A few years ago, she got married, and I wasn’t invited. She claimed it was a small ceremony with only her husband’s family and a few close friends. I was hurt, but I didn’t make a big deal out of it and let it go.

Fast forward to now—I’m getting married. My fiancé and I are planning a slightly larger wedding with close family and friends. When it came time to send out invitations, I decided not to invite my sister. I felt like if she didn’t want me at her wedding, I shouldn’t feel obligated to invite her to mine. 

My parents are furious and say I’m being petty and that I should be the bigger person. They insist that I invite her because “family is family.” But to me, it’s more about reciprocation and not wanting someone at my wedding who didn’t think I was important enough to be at theirs. My fiancé supports my decision but thinks it might cause unnecessary drama. 

Now, my sister found out she wasn’t invited and called me, upset. She said she didn’t invite me to her wedding because she was under a lot of stress at the time and regrets it now. She accused me of holding a grudge and ruining our relationship even further. 

I feel like I’m justified in my decision, but now I’m second-guessing myself. AITA for not inviting her?

1f4g33i,AITA for Calling an Ambulance for My Drunk Wife Who Passed Out in a Club Bathroom?,"Last Saturday night, my wife (30F) and I (30M) went to a concert with a friend who recently moved to our city. My wife had been recovering from a cold and was excited to go out, as it had been a while since we had a night out together. I drove, so I only had one beer, but my wife and our friend kept drinking throughout the night.

As the gig went on, I noticed my wife having more drinks and getting quite drunk, but she was having so much fun that I didn’t want to ruin it. Toward the end of the concert, my wife went to the bathroom. When the gig finished, our friend and I waited for her outside, but after 20 minutes with no sign of her and unanswered calls, we started to worry. 

We showed a picture of my wife to someone leaving the bathroom, and a woman told us she had seen my wife passed out in a toilet cubicle, covered in her own vomit and unresponsive. My heart sank. I had never seen her like this before, and I was genuinely scared for her safety. The staff came to help and strongly suggested calling an ambulance. I agreed immediately, fearing alcohol poisoning or a spiked drink.

The paramedics arrived and took my wife to the emergency department. I drove there and arrived shortly after the ambulance. Thankfully, she came around a few hours later, and the doctor said she was fine, just extremely drunk. The next day, my wife was able to laugh at the whole thing but felt that I overreacted by calling the ambulance. She said it was unnecessary and that the whole experience was traumatizing and embarrassing.

I explained to her that I was following the advice of the venue staff and was genuinely worried something more serious could have happened, like choking on her vomit. It’s been a few days, and she still insists I shouldn't have called an ambulance. We have private healthcare that covers ambulance costs, so that wasn’t an issue, but I’m starting to question if I did overreact.

1epxmtk,AITAH for not babysitting for my cousin last minute?,"I am 20f and my cousins wife, “Nora,” is 38f. I received a text from her yesterday asking if I could babysit her 1yo baby today because she was to be having fibroid removal surgery. My cousin “Jack,” 36m was to be driving her and was staying at the hospital. The surgery was supposed to be this fall, but they told her last minute that they had an opening for her today. In the message she told me that money is currently very tight between her and my cousin, so they would not be able to pay me. This would have been fine and I would have accepted, had I not been scheduled to work. She would have needed me there at 7am and my shift was 6am-noon. 

So I politely told her I could not babysit. She never responded. I went downstairs after this exchange and my mom asked “so what time are you babysitting?” I told her I was not, I have work. She told me I was so rude to not call off for Nora and that she was disappointed in my behavior. I asked her why she didn’t call off work to watch Nora’s baby if it was so important to her. She basically told me I was a brat and that I know her job is a “real job.” I work in food service. She knows I work and that I take my job seriously. I’m working to pay for school and both me and my boyfriend are saving every penny to hopefully move in together within the next year. She called me a few other rude names and is now not speaking to me. 

She also must have told some of my other family members about the situation. I’ve now received 2 texts, including one from my grandma, about how I should be willing to do anything for my family and that I need to “make exceptions for family.” I’m annoyed at the whole situation. 

As for Nora, I do feel bad that she was stressed looking for a last minute babysitter on top of having surgery and I don’t know what she ended up doing.

1eocq8l,AITA for buying locks and a mini fridge in my room?,"I (16f) am the oldest in my family. I have 8 younger siblings age 12, 10, 9, 9, 6, 4, 4, and 2. privacy is very hard to come by around here. Luckily, I only share a room with one person (12f), but I might as well share with everyone because my siblings come barging in every five minutes and snoop through my things, especially when I’m not home. 

I have some very expensive makeup and hair products that I keep stashed in my drawer. Last week, the 4yo twins came in and smashed or emptied half the items. I have special editions of books, and 10f came in and rumpled some pages a few days ago. And my friend made me some traditional food from her culture, which I put in the fridge (LABELED) up high, and somehow my siblings ignored it and ate it yesterday. Things like this happen all the time, and the only one who doesn’t do this kind of thing is 12. 

I’ve spoken to my parents about things like this, but they always say it’s part of having siblings and I need to put my things away better or learn to share, since they’re only little. The thing is, I do put my things away, and they still go through my entire room to find them. So I gave up and I bought a door lock and Childs locks for my drawers, as well as a mini fridge (I am going to share the fridge with 12 because I know she won’t eat the food I put in there). I put the lock on the door and locked my drawers and bookcases yesterday. 

My parents didn’t even notice, they apparently found out after a bunch of kids came crying to them about how ‘they can’t get in my room to use my cool things’. When I came home from work today, they confronted me about how I shouldn’t shut my siblings out. I told them if they knocked on the door and asked me to use my things, I would probably say yes. But since they don’t know how to do that and instead sneak in when I’m not home, I was going to keep the locks on to protect my stuff. 12 also told me she likes the door lock too. 

But my parents are angry because I never asked them, and again, I’m ‘shutting my siblings out’. They’re punishing me by not letting me leave the house except work/school for the next month, but they can’t take the locks off because I bought them with my own money. I thought I was in the right, but my mom and dad are furious and I don’t know who’s correct here, since they are the adults and know better, but I already notice an improvement to my mood (and the noise levels).

1f0h4cs,AITA for refusing to give back the laptop my mother gave me to punish younger sister,"I (23f) am starting grad school this year. My laptop recently broke and I couldn't afford a good one, my mother said my little sister (16f) has been ""acting up"" recently and not listening and she'd like to give me her laptop since ""she's been horrible lately.""

Now my mother tends to spoil her so it is her fault my sister turned out this way (ofcourse she'll hear none of it), she has a bad habit of not following through on punishments and ""canceling"" them when my sister pitches enough of a fit. 

I asked my mom ""are you absolutely sure you aren't going to call me later and ask for it back when she pitches a fit? Because if I'm gifted this I'm not giving it back unless you buy me one of equal or greater value."" She said ""yes I'm sure I've had enough of her antics"" so I went over and picked up the laptop when sister wasn't home and that was that or so I thought. 

It only took about a day before my mother called me begging for the laptop back because my sister has become unbearable and I said ""are you going to buy me one of equal or greater value?"" And she just kept begging for me to bring it back she couldn't stand it anymore, I told her no she never follows through on disciplining sister and its her fault the way she turned out its about time she followed through on a consequence and I'm not giving it back we had this discussion, and it's her fault for dragging me into this in the first place. She then screams at me and hung up and now won't speak to me. 

Dad always gives into whatever mom wants ""happy wife happy life"" and is telling me to ""be the bigger person"" and give it back, and I said I'm sticking to my guns and he's sent me several nasty texts and emails because now mom is on his case and he can't stand it and he's saying it's all my fault and this had just hugely blown up.

1f57hzw,AITA for telling my son he needs to learn to get along with other students? ,"Our son(13M) went to the same elementary school as many of his friends. We moved away to another section of the city because my mom was very sick and it allowed us to take care of her without driving 40 min each way. She needed to be checked on frequently and so we did it for her so she didn’t need to go to a nursing home. But we didn’t think it would affect our son so much. My son is very gifted in math and engineering and is probably the typical nerdy kid. Things were fine when he was in the equally nerdy elementary school. Parents specially go to that school district because of the full AP and IB high school and the property values in the neighborhood makes the schools there have special programs and after school programs. There was a robotics program for their middle school which I don’t believe is offered elsewhere. 

My mom passed 3 months ago and as we live nearby we are going to be renoing the home ourselves and moving in to live nearby which will take probably a year before selling. My old sister is in Europe so I don’t have other family help in this. The problem is my son has been complaining about bullying with the school year starting he wants to go back to the original school district. My wife wants us to go back (as we sold our house at the peak and are currently renting) and rent there so he can go back while we travel 40 min each way to reno after we both work full time. 

It also means adding the cost of renting while we need to travel back and forth. My wife wants us to hire professionals and just deduct that from the sale of my mom’s house. I feel like one more year isn’t a lot to put up with but my son doesn’t want to go back to this school when he normally enjoys school. He says the other kids make fun of him because my wife packs him meals. They bully him for everything according to him. The school he is registered to near my mom’s house is more in a rough area. I don’t think it means it’s bad but he hates it and cannot seem to relate to the other students. 

I don’t want him to be privileged and live in a bubble but my wife who also moved from a more normal school district to a more affluent and “gifted” school said it was more fun to be where other kids take academic seriously and didn’t make fun of her for liking it. I have sat my son down and told him that life means he needs to deal with environments he isn’t use to and it’s better for us (as a family and for our finances) to wait until we sold the house and can more back next year. He got angry and said he never wanted to move and I said it was for grandma and he argued grandma passed so we should move back and I said he should try to get along with the other students and the fact he cannot is on him. He refused to talk to me all week and refused to go back to school shopping which is normally his favourite time of year.

1ezotps,AITA for refusing to switch to another stylist during my haircut?,"

So this happened recently, and I’m still wondering if I was in the wrong.

I had an appointment with my usual hairstylist and was already in the chair with my haircut underway. While I was getting my hair cut, some guy walked in without an appointment and started talking to my hairstylist. The stylist explained that he was busy cutting my hair and mentioned that I was also getting my beard done afterward.

Despite this, the guy kept pleading with the stylist to squeeze him in. Eventually, my stylist asked me if I would be willing to move to another stylist so he could help this walk-in guy out. I didn’t feel comfortable switching stylists mid-cut, so I politely said no.

The guy got upset and called me an @sshole saying I was being unreasonable and selfish. I didn’t think I was in the wrong but he made a huge deal about it.

1fd0m2c,AITA for refusing to move out even though my roommate is 7 months pregnant?,"Hi guys, last week my roommate Becca found out she is not only pregnant but seven months along. 

She texted me that we had to talk today and  I had assumed she would be moving out soon for more space when the baby comes. Instead she told me I have to move out to make space for the nursery and her baby daddy to move in. 

I’m on a terrible salary and cannot afford anywhere else to live, plus like she wants me to move out right now so she can prepare for the baby. Even if I wanted to move out now, the apartment rentals in my area are either too expensive or well below living standards so I don’t want to move. 

She went absolutely crazy the moment I told her I wouldn’t move out, because I’m ruining her motherhood experience by not letting her family live together. I pay rent here and my names on the lease until at least the end of the year. I’m not gonna pull out of the lease and I told her that if she wants her little family together that she should move and I’ll find someone to half the cheap rent with. 

That made her start crying and saying how I just want to ruin her life to the point her baby daddy had to console her and tell me to get out of their way already. I’ve not heard her stop crying since but I think I’m totally valid that I don’t want to leave.

1fbibcr,AITA for signing my kids up for public school behind my wife's back?,"So, I (36M) am a dad to 6-year-old twins, and my wife (28F) is a stay-at-home mom who has recently gone full crunchy mom mode. She's all about essential oils, no processed foods, cloth diapers when they were babies, and she's absolutely against anything mainstream. For the longest time I didn’t mind because a lot of it is about healthy living and I want the best for our kids. But things are starting to get way out of control.

The latest issue is that my wife is dead set on homeschooling the twins. She’s convinced that public school is “toxic” and that our kids won’t thrive in a system that’s “designed to make them little robots.” She even has a few friends in her crunchy mom group who homeschool their kids and she’s been talking nonstop about joining their co-op. I’ve expressed my concerns about this from the beginning. I work full-time and I don’t think she realizes how hard it’s going to be to manage homeschooling two kids at the same time while giving them a proper education.

But she won’t hear it. Anytime I bring up public school she shuts it down immediately, saying she doesn't want the twins to get bullied or that we’ll lose control of what they’re learning. I just don’t think homeschooling is realistic and I can’t see how she’ll keep them on any sort of consistent schedule.

I gave her time to prove me wrong over the summer, thinking maybe she’d ease into it and have a plan. Instead, she’s spent most of the time bouncing between different unschooling philosophies and signing them up for random activities with her crunchy mom friends. The kids are constantly bored, and I’ve seen them starting to fall behind.

I'm not proud to admit it but I went behind her back and enrolled the twins in public school for the fall. I told her a few weeks before school started and she absolutely lost it. She accused me of betraying her and said I was undermining her role as a mother. She keeps saying I don’t trust her to raise our kids which isn’t true. I just don’t think she’s prepared to handle homeschooling and I don’t want the twins to suffer because of it.

She spent the whole first week of school trying to make me feel guilty by saying the twins are miserable and that I’ve ruined their childhoods by forcing them into the system. The thing is as far as I can tell the twins actually loved their first week school. They’ve made friends and like their teacher. But my wife keeps insisting they’re just pretending to like it to make me happy.

Now, she’s talking about pulling them out mid-year and starting over with her homeschooling plan but I’m putting my foot down. I want the best for my kids, and I honestly think public school is the right choice for them right now. My wife is making me feel like I’m the bad guy for going behind her back and forcing them into something she was so against.

AITA for enrolling the twins in public school without her consent? Should I have handled it differently? I'm starting to feel really guilty about what this is doing to my wife.

**EDITING TO ADD:**

* Yes the twins are vaccinated. My wife wasn't so far in the crunchy pipeline back then. Her friends do sometimes make her feel bad about that.

* I looked into homeschooling and unschooling and did my research. I had hoped my wife had a plan which was why I gave her the summer to figure that out.",atmylimitsnow,10265,2920,0.949999988079071,0.7603876008320227,1725746282,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fbibcr/aita_for_signing_my_kids_up_for_public_school/,2024,9,AmItheAsshole,2024-09-07 21:58:02

1fn56zw,AITA for continuing to change in front of my window even after my neighbor complained?,"I (early 30s F) bought a house last year with my fiancé, but we only just moved in a few months ago because it needed some work. Our neighbors are a woman, her husband, and their college-aged son. Everything was fine until a few weeks ago when the neighbor woman came over, visibly upset, and told me she saw me changing through my window and would appreciate if I didn’t do that there.

I was surprised because the angle of the window makes it so that someone would really have to go out of their way to see anything. I checked it out myself, and unless you’re standing in a very specific spot in their yard, you can’t see much at all.

To be clear, no one in her family (husband or son) has ever mentioned seeing me; she was just “worried” that they might. I didn’t feel like I should have to change my habits for her, especially since they’d have to be actively trying to look in. So I kept changing there, as I had been.

Well, she came over again last week, this time freaking out at my fiancé, calling me a “whore” and accusing me of being disrespectful. I honestly think it’s ridiculous because I’m in my own home and I’m not flaunting myself. her husband came over and apologized and said he asked her specifically not to do that, and clarified he hadn’t ever mentioned seeing me nor had his son.

1fq9egy,AITA for disagreeing with my wife’s idea of her never learning how to cook? ,"My wife (24) and I (26 yr old female) are struggling in our marriage as she believes she does not need to help cook or prepare food or even help clean up after, besides dishes. 

She was raised in a family with no chores and they had a maid come clean the house. She has never learned to cook and can not boil water despite me walking her through it, she just loses patience. I love my wife and have taken time out of our evenings to show her how to cook and measure spices, for example. She lasts about 2 minutes before either walking away or throwing a tantrum that she doesn’t want to learn and I should be the only who in this house who has to know how to cook. 

The other night, I got home from work and was exhausted since it has been a busy week in healthcare. She complained she has not spent enough time with me these past few days, so I offered to have her cook with me so she can learn while also spending time together. I thought it would be cute to make a recipe together that we never ate before. She threw a fit and said she just wanted to just TV but eventually agreed to sit in the kitchen with me. About 10 minutes in, I asked her to wash a grill rack since she usually does the dishes when I cook. Surprise, she threw a tantrum. Eventually she did it because she was hungry and I was busy cooking 3 different parts of the dinner. A few minutes later I had to go outside to and grill some chicken and I asked if she could start putting some spices away so I would have less clean up. I think you know what happened next… 

She eventually stopped yelling and complaining and put some stuff away. I gave her her plate of food first to enjoy since I still had some cleaning up to do. I talked to some friends about it and they said if it was their significant other who never cooked they would eventually said they had to prepare their own meals if they would not help. 

I have mentioned in the past she should learn to cook on her own for numerous reasons but one being that she is a very picky eater so anything I do cook, I have to prepare differently and seperately. 

I am also the one who does the “handyman” duties as well as take care of all the bills and yardwork. I do have to give credit where credit is due and mention that she does the dishes and puts the laundry away. Am I the asshole for wanting her to learn how to cook and/or at least help in preparing the kitchen?

1fgx5ai,AITA for refusing to give my roommate a tampon?,"My roommate (23f) and I (22f) have been living together for about a year now. I have been renting on my own since I was 17 and this is her first apartment. Her lack of experience shows. 

I’ve had to remind her to pay me for utilities and rent a few times, and she is often a couple days late. She also doesn’t really pick up after herself and leaves dishes in the sink for over a week sometimes. I’ve had to ask her to contribute to buying necessities of daily living, such as toilet paper, dish soap, paper towels, laundry detergent, etc. because she always just waits for me to buy them. 

A few months ago I started my period and when I went to the bathroom to take care of it I saw she had used all of my tampons and didn’t ever buy more to replace them. Needless to say, I was very annoyed. She could have at least texted me to give me a heads up or something. I asked her why she used mine and didn’t buy her own. She told me she was broke and I didn’t really know how to argue with that so I just asked her to at least tell me next time.

And then it happened again! A couple weeks ago I started my period and when I went to the bathroom, my box of tampons was completely empty. Now I was livid. When I purchased more I started keeping them in my room and hiding a few in a clever spot in the bathroom so she wouldn’t find them. 

Yesterday she knocked on my bedroom door and asked if I had a tampon from the other side. I told her I bought a box a little while ago (the one she emptied) and there should still be some left because I haven’t used them. She said she would check but I didn’t hear from her again that night after she went to the bathroom. 

I did have tampons. They were in my room. 

Now I feel like an asshole, like I’ve betrayed the sisterhood. I could have given her at least one and told her to purchase more herself. But I was admittedly still bitter because of how she is as a roommate in general.

1fbjj26,AITA for hiding my boyfriend’s anime body pillow while my parents were visiting?,"My boyfriend (M/32) and I (F/27) have been together for a year. He’s only met my parents once over the holidays last year because they live pretty far away. They've been visiting this past week and since he and I just moved in together they were excited to see our new place, and get to know my BF a little more.

We have an extra bedroom, and this has become my boyfriend’s gaming room for the most part but we agreed when guests come over it would be a second bedroom. He really likes video games and anime in particular so he has a lot of toys and artwork that he’s collected over the years from different games and such. 

One thing he has is this anime body pillow that features a sexy anime girl on it. He also has a mousepad for his gaming computer that resembles a busty anime girl. Before my parents came over I asked him to take down his toys and stuff so they could be comfortable. I was upset to see that he left the body pillow and the mousepad in place.

I don’t really feel comfortable with either item but he’s really into anime so I’ve always kind of left it alone. But I absolutely didn’t think it was appropriate to leave it in there when my parents would be staying over. I took the cover off the body pillow and put the pillow in the closet and I put the mousepad in a drawer in our room.

When my parents arrived and we showed them to their room, my BF noticed the missing pillow and mousepad. Later, when we were in bed, he brought it up to me and asked why I hid them. I told him I didn’t think my parents would feel comfortable with those things in the bedroom and when they leave we can put them back.

My BF got really upset. He told me that he feels like I’m ashamed of his interest in anime. He said he’s spent his whole life feeling like people think he’s weird for being into anime and he didn’t expect his own GF to be “just like everyone else”. 

The next day, I noticed him taking some of his manga books off our bookshelf and putting them into a box. I asked him why and he said something like “I’m putting them away so you don’t have to look at them anymore”.

I feel really bad, I feel like I hurt him but I just really didn’t think my parents would feel comfortable sleeping in a room with those items. But now he’s just acting so distant and cold and he’s not really engaging with my parents at all. They keep asking me what’s wrong and I don’t know what to say.

I finally came out and saw this and asked why he hadn’t made any breakfast for her yet… he proceeds to say “I was waiting to ask you what to make for her” (note: she is one and eats scrambled eggs on daycare days like today) I said that’s a lie you know what she eats by now. Anyways this comment sparked a disagreement between us because I vented about his lack of assistance in helping to get her or any of her belongings ready to go in the morning. His solution after getting frustrated with me was to tell me I need to “make him a list of what I would like him to do for her” and I refused as I said I don’t want to mother him as well and as her parent he should know what needs to be done (diaper changes, outfit, teeth brushing, daycare bottles cleaned and filled up, etc.) I tried explaining that as her mom no one ever gives me a “list” I simply look around or think about what needs to be done.

My 82-year-old Dad isn’t going with them. When 8 asked why, they said that he is not interested because he is very comfortable staying at home, and he doesn’t want to leave the dogs with a pet sitter. My Mom privately requested that I visit my Dad once a day, spend time with him, etc. I have a very busy work schedule so I don’t see how this is really possible, and beyond that, I don’t really get why an adult man needs to be babysat. I told her this and she said he isn’t all mentally there—I haven’t seen evidence of this, besides anecdotal evidence. I told her I wouldn’t babysit my Dad but I would call him and check in on the weekend. She is furious at me, saying that she will be too worried about my Dad being okay to enjoy the vacation. I pointed out she could call him whenever she wanted but she just hung up on me basically. 

I feel a little bad but I also think the whole concept is kind of insulting to my Dad and a waste of my time. AITA?

1fd0y3b,AITA for telling my boyfriend his family are leeches after meeting them for the first time?,"We’ve been dating for about 4 months and last night was the first time I met his family. They were nice at first but I couldn’t stand the sight of them at the end of the night.

Dinner conversation was normal as they asked about me and my family. Then the table divided into smaller conversation groups and I overheard his older brothers talking to his sister about investing. I’m not an expert so I’ll give you the gist of what I heard.

She’s been out of school for a couple of years and have saved up about $75,000 and wants to start investing. They said property is the best and that section 8 is the way to go. They said that the rent is always paid on time and the people won’t mess up the property because they’re afraid of getting kicked out of the program. They said the best part is that they’ll still own the properties and the value will always go up. They said they’re developing a small neighborhood with about 10 houses specifically for section 8. All of those houses under 2000 sqft and have 4 bedrooms as section 8 pays higher rates for more bedrooms and smaller houses are cheaper to maintain. They said that it’ll cost them about $100/sqft to build these houses and the rent will be about $4000 per month. They said that she could buy in on her first rental house next year when they start another development. They’re in the process of closing on a piece of land that will accommodate about 20 houses.

I cringed then couldn’t keep quiet anymore. I told them that instead of renting out and keeping those houses off the market, they should sell them to those people. They looked at me quietly and I knew they never considered helping people out by selling the houses they were building. His dad told me I was out of line and I answered that his family was out of line for preying on people in need while feeding off of the taxes people pay. I said that most people can’t afford to buy a single house yet his sons are building 10-20 at a time which makes them leeches. 

We argued for a bit then we left. This morning my boyfriend told me I need to apologize to his family but I refused to. We just met after my last class and told me we’re no longer invited to any of his family function including the Christmas trip back to their old country. Since we're still in school, his family was going to pay for us so he really wants me to apologize and smooth things over.

I know I’m right but maybe I shouldn’t have been so harsh on the first meeting.

What do you think?

It’s been a really tough journey for my husband (36M) and me, and we’ve gone through rounds of IVF, countless doctor appointments, and a lot of emotional highs and lows. Most of my family knows about it, including my sister (29F), who just got married last [weekend.At](http://weekend.At) the reception, my sister gave a speech. Everything started out normal, but then she started making a joke about how I was the “favorite” child because I didn’t have kids and could still live my life freely, unlike her and other “tired” parents. She laughed, and so did some guests. I could feel my face getting hot and my stomach dropped. This was a topic I had confided in her many times, and it felt like she was mocking something that caused me a lot of pain.I stayed seated for another few minutes, but I couldn’t take it. I quietly got up, left the table, and ended up leaving the wedding entirely. My husband came with me, and on the way home, I started getting texts from family members asking why I left.

1fmg8kx,"AITA for locking the pantry to stop my roommate from eating all my food?

","So, I (26F) live with two roommates, and one of them, “Jess” (28F), has a bad habit of eating other people's food. At first, it was small things like a handful of chips or a piece of fruit, and I didn’t really care. But lately, she’s been eating entire meals I’ve prepped for the week, snacks, basically everything. I’ve confronted her multiple times, and she always apologizes, saying she’ll replace it, but she never does.

I’ve asked her to just respect what’s mine, and she’ll agree, but the next day, something else goes missing. It’s driving me insane because groceries are expensive, and I don’t want to budget extra just to feed her.

I finally got fed up and bought a small lock for the pantry I use and started keeping my dry goods and snacks in there. I also cleared out a section of the fridge for my food and labeled everything that’s mine. Since I installed the lock, Jess has been super passive-aggressive, saying I’m “treating her like a child” and making the house feel uncomfortable. She even made a sarcastic comment in front of friends about me “putting everything under lock and key.”

Now, the other roommate, “Sara,” says she understands why I’m frustrated, but she thinks I took it too far by locking up my food and creating tension in the house. I honestly don’t think I’m in the wrong here, but now I’m second-guessing myself.

1fnyawx,AITA for crying when my entire family started to speak a language I barely know?,"So I'm a 14 year old guy and my parents are from Taiwan their native language is Mandarin. My older sister(19F) and older brother(17M) both speak it pretty much fluently. Well by the time I came around and was like old enough to actually learn stuff my family rarely spoke our native language. Due to that I barely speak it, my mom said I barely compare to a toddler in the language so she signed me up for online Mandarin lessons that I'm starting this week.


Today when I came home from school my sister was the only one home and greeted me in Mandarin and started speaking to me in it, I asked her why in English and she told me in English that our parents want everyone to speak more Mandarin around the house. I just started to have a lot of anxiety because of it and tonight at dinner everyone was speaking Mandarin and I can't really pick up on most of it, I understand enough to like kind of understand what's happening in the conversation but barely and sometimes I get lost. Then my brother turns to me and asked me a question in Mandarin and I just didn't understand a single word of it and I started to cry. I told my mom that she is bullying me for not knowing how to speak our native language and she even agreed that it's her fault and I don't get why she's doing this to me. My sister then said in English ""see i told you something like this would happen"" to my mom. My mom then got mad and said that learning this is important and she isn't going to let me crying about it stop her from making me learn it.",O0OwE3E,5759,1250,0.8799999952316284,0.3601270377502861,1727133318,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fnyawx/aita_for_crying_when_my_entire_family_started_to/,2024,9,AmItheAsshole,2024-09-23 23:15:18
1ft9jaf,AITA for telling my friend she can't bring her baby to my wedding?,"I (20F) am getting married in a few months, and my fiancé (24M) and I have decided that we want a child-free wedding. We want our big day to be a more formal, adult affair without the interruptions that can come with having kids around. I sent out the invitations, clearly stating that it’s a child-free event, and most people seemed fine with it—except for one of my closest friends (21F), who recently had a baby.

She called me and said she couldn’t attend if she couldn’t bring her baby, as she’s still breastfeeding and doesn’t have anyone she trusts to leave the baby with. I told her I understood her situation but that we’re sticking to our no-kids policy. She got really upset and said that I’m being unreasonable and putting her in a difficult position, especially since she’s made so much effort to support me throughout my relationship and wedding planning.

Now, some of our mutual friends are siding with her, saying I should make an exception for her since it’s such a unique situation.

1fnvdia,AITA for allowing my wife to pick my son's names and not letting my family call him a 'Westernised' nickname? ,"We live in England, wife is South Asian and I am white British (late 20S F and M). We have young boy twins, just under 2 years old. Names are important and we don't mind who sees this so we're using exact first names but not surname. 

I had no name preferences, am uninventive and have a boring 'British' name myself, think John James Jacob Smith (not really, but basically). With our kids, they both have my surname, 'Smith', and from day 1 I said I wanted her pick on first names and she chose lovely names from her culture that I fell in love with. 

So our boys are Ramin Navroz Smith and Rustom Parvez Smith, which means 'joyous new year' and 'victorious hero' in its Parsi origins. We liked that they were similar ish without being the same.

The boys will live in the UK so obviously we have no problem with either shortening their name or going by a nickname at school as long as its their choice. Plus it's not likely theyll do it for racialised reasons: we live in very diverse London. 

Problem: boys are not identical, and like many mixed race siblings, they look a bit different. They have similar features but Ramin has dark hair and eyes like his mum and Rustom has light hair and eyes like me. They're both ethnically ambiguous and very young if you're thinking in terms of ""white passing"" you would say Rustom will find it easier to ""pass"" while Ramin a bit harder. We don't micromanage our toddlers racial traits so haven't given much thought to it. 

Unfortunately, my family (except my parents) seem to have given this too much thought. 

SIL started it by repeatedly commenting that Ramin looked like a Ramin but Rustom didn't look like a Rustom and we were just ??? but let it go. Then she and my brother start calling him 'Russell' as a nickname, get extended fam to do it to the point he starts answering to it and people use the nickname in captions or texts. We said no multiple times! 

We put our foot DOWN and said only my parents could see either boy till they knock the Russell shit off. Cue flood of tears from SIL and blame from others, telling us it was just well meaning nicknaming, that her 3 yo daughter came up w it and that we're oversensitive.

I feel we're going insane as other than my parents, everyone seems on their side and saying we're draconian? We don't care if the boys want a nickname at any point but they're babies, and I just can't buy ""it has nothing to do with race"" when they're doing it to the blonde kid and not the ""darker"" one. I also can't buy that their child gave the name because of the above + WHAT 3 y/o comes up with ""Russell""??? 

Our line = we do not want this weird difference to exist between the boys before they even comprehend race. We think it's damaging longterm to give one boy a ""white name"" just because he's blonde, especially as the two do actually look different. 

But maybe we are too close to it and SO many people keep telling us it's harmless/we're overthinking? Help!

He really wanted to and made Mac n cheese. This needed to go in the oven and he wanted to use a form that is very difficult to clean so I told him to use a backing sheet of some sort to make sure it didn’t stick too much. He chose not to. 

After he was finished and the form was burnt and lots of pieces stuck to it. He put it to soak and asked me before bed if I could clean it for him the morning after. 

I told him no.

1f7jdth,AITA for asking a woman to teach her autistic son boundaries? ,"My grandmother became friends with a family who a few years ago moved to her same neighborhood, they have a son with autism, he is 16 years old.

I lived my entire childhood with my grandmother and a few months ago I returned to live with her because someone must take care of her because of some problems that happened.

My grandmother has always been really friendly and the boy's mother always goes to her house with her son and his babysitter. I've been doing a few dialogues with them and the guy has started to get more trusting with me. 

He is non-verbal, his way of communicating is touching people and he gets too close for my liking. I don't like physical contact and it bothers me that people don't respect personal space but I try to be respectful. 

When the guy comes up close to rubbing his nose against my cheek (that's how close he gets, it's his way of Communicate) I walk away but he continues following me, his family finds him adorable and they are happy that he is comfortable with me but I am not. 

They even started making jokes that he's in love with me. I'm an adult, there's nothing funny or cute on saying those kind of things. 

I have asked the boy to please keep his distance from me but he does not listen to me, I have tried to make him respect my limits but it does not happen and he even follows me to my room sometimes. 
Anyway, a few days ago I approached the mother alone and told her that I feel uncomfortable when someone gets so close to me, that she should teach him to have limits with some people because in the future that could bring him problems. 

She just said to me ""Sisi, thank you for the advice"" but now I have found out that she complained about me to my grandmother and did not come to visit her because she says she felt uncomfortable that I discriminated her son. 

I really don't think I said anything wrong, in my internship I have worked with people with autism and their families correct those behaviors but even my mother told me that I was wrong so I don't know, aitah?

First, it was my therapist, as l've previously stated I had already trimmed my hair last month, (and I barely wanted it tbh) I said I didn't have the courage many times but she kept saying that it was only 10cm.

It used to be better when I was younger, but I just don’t expect a lot from him anymore before all this and he has totally messed up things for everyone. He cheated on my mom and they separated back in the spring. My mom found out because he got the woman he was cheating with pregnant and had to come clean.  I stayed with mom and told him to kick rocks because how dare he?  My mom is the nicest and most supportive person in the world. If a hug were a person, that would be my mom. He’s been trying to get me to meet up with him and talk and I told him that as long as he’s still with the affair woman he’s never going to see me. He said that since they’re going to have a baby he has to be there for the baby. I told him looks like he made his choice then.

This weekend he just showed up at my mom’s house in tears.  My mom let him in and he said that the baby died. I went upstairs and left them alone.  He came up to my room later and asked if we can talk and I said no.  He said that he really misses me and he wants to find a way to make things ok between us. I told him I don’t care and to leave me alone. Then he said that he’s just lost a daughter and can’t I just cut him some slack right now because he’s been punished enough?  That pissed me off pretty bad because he caused this whole problem in the first place, so I told him that he already picked the people that he cares about more and he can’t just do a takesies-backsies now that the kid died. So now he’s 0-2, hope it was worth it. He left.

My mom came up later and said that while she understands why I’m angry at him, he’s really hurting right now and throwing it back at him was wrong.

So for a bit of backstory I have 4 kids, 2 from myself, 2 from my partner (both female) and my two older children made a friend with a kid down the street, he's been coming over for about a week, and he'll spend hours at my house at a time. I don't have a problem with this, he's a very nice kid, and I don't mind taking another kid to the park. (I'm also a stay at home mom) well, yesterday, I finally met his mother. And I knew the kid was Mormon, but I personally don't raise my children in religion even though I identify as a theistic Satanist. Well his mom saw my baphomet necklace (which honestly my best friend gave me when we were kids, and I just still wear it regularly) well she practically blew up on me, telling me I'm sending my own kids and her child to hell, and that I was obviously planning this because I didn't tell her. And then I dropped the fact that I am also in a homosexual relationship, and maybe she should check where her kids are, instead of having random people from the neighborhood watch her children while she's at work... 

Anyways. Am I the asshole? Because personally I don't feel like she's entitled to my information if she doesn't want to have a relationship with me?

1fffwe4,AITA for not sticking up for my boyfriend when his friends made fun of his weight?,"My 24F boyfriend “Steve” 28M has always been on the chubbier side. He still is somewhat active and is not fat by any means but definitely not thin. I used to be thin when Steve and I got together 18 months ago, but have since gained about 20 lbs. I’m still a healthy weight for my height, but not thin anymore.

A couple nights ago, Steve and I were out for dinner. He told me I should watch what I eat because I’m gaining weight. I rolled my eyes and ordered a burger and fries (same thing as Steve) because I thought it was just a poorly thought out joke. But on the car ride home he told me he was concerned because I was gaining weight and becoming unhealthy and less attractive. He put it gently, but I was still upset and pointed out that he wasn’t the poster child of thinness himself, but he said it’s different because he’s the same size he was when we got together.

I told him to give it a rest and slept in the guest room that night. When I woke up the next morning, he apologized profusely and begged me to forgive him. Since he’d never messed up that bad throughout our year and a half of dating, I told him we could just move past it.

I thought we had forgotten about it until last night when we were out with Steve and his friends. They were joking as male friends normally do, which means they were throwing around insults. One of Steve’s friends made a silly comment about Steve’s weight and suddenly they were all piling on. “Yeah Steve, you ARE fat, hahaha.” Steve laughed along, but it was obvious to me that he was hurt by the comments. I thought about telling the friends to cut it out, but then remembered what Steve said to me just a few nights prior and decided he could handle a bit of playful teasing.

When we got home, Steve asked me why I didn’t stick up for him when I knew he was uncomfortable. I told him I thought he could handle it, given what he so comfortably said to me the other night. Steve said it was different because he didn’t make fun of my weight in front of my friends and he was coming from a place of concern. He said he thought we had agreed to move past the comment he made and that what I did was petty and holding a grudge. I told him we weren’t going to get anywhere with this conversation and we should take time to cool off and think.

Steve booked a hotel last night and should be getting home any minute now. I’m still not sure if what I did was wrong. I talked to my sister and she said I should have joined in with Steve’s friends and I wasn’t mean enough, but my sister’s also a lot bolder than me. If I am the AH, I should apologize when Steve gets back. Any thoughts are appreciated.

1f6sqo8,AITA for taking my cat to college?,"When I was 16 I adopted a kitten out of a litter we found in a hay barn abandoned. My mom was entirely against the idea and she hated me for bringing a cat home because she has notoriously always hated cats her whole life. Last year was my first year at college, and since I was in the dorms I did not bring my cat. This year I’m in an apartment and am finally ready to have my buddy move in with me. My mom and dad are now both guilt tripping me to leave him here. In the one year that I was away at college, my mom became extremely attached to this cat (that she didn’t want at all), and now all of a sudden it’s her cat and me taking it is disgusting and immoral and will “break her heart”. My parents are both over 50, so leveling with them is completely impossible because they think they know better always so they never have to listen to my side of things. I adopted my cat for just that reason, because he would be MY cat and I could keep him by my side no matter where. Now my mom and dad are trying to take that away from me. And not directly either. I could take my cat very easily with no real issues, but the guilt and pressure being placed on my shoulders by my parents is eating away at me constantly I don’t know what to do.

1fsfv8e,AITAH For not helping my adult sister after our parents passed away ,"I (45f) have a sister (55f) who our parents have always helped/bailed out of every situation she's ever been in.  She has 2 kids so! (32) daughter (30).  My sister and her adult kids were living with my parents and my parents were paying all of the bills.  Over the recent years both of our parents have passed away.  First our mom then our father.  Once my mom passed away I started taking care of my dad's finances and began cutting my sister off.  I no longer gave her the ""allowance"" that my mom had been giving her each month.  After dad passed away I informed the three of them that I was selling the house.  They looked at me confused and asked why.  I simply told them there was no one to pay for it anymore.  They found a place to rent and eventually my nephew bought a house.  He met a girl and they got married.  Here's where I am wondering if I am the asshole.  My sister is living with my nephew and his wife and they are starting a new life/family together.  More info I finally after my  parents passed away married my long time boyfriend and we are starting a life together ourselves.   I feel like I have always put everyone's needs and wants before my own.  So, AITAH for not taking in my sister so my nephew can start a new life and family?

1f8cc4t,AITA for how I told my family that I have cancer?,"I (24F) discovered a couple weeks ago that I have breast cancer. It came as a real shock to me because I had practically no symptoms. I was at the hospital for a different reason and from there referred internally to the mammography suite. (That's not really important to the story but just a little context on how I was diagnosed). But the good news is that doctors were able to catch it early and the outlook is good.

My problem, aside from the obvious, is that I had no idea how to tell my family. I knew they would panic regardless, which is understandable as I lost two great aunts to breast cancer and my dad also has stomach cancer. So I just kind of avoided telling them because there's a lot going on in my family at the minute. I didn't want to put any more on their plate. But then I did my first round of chemo and it floored me. I knew then that I had to tell them because I genuinely couldn't go through that alone again. 

This is where I'm possibly the AH. My family are really bad with emotional stuff. We're not good at expressing ourselves. We can laugh and make jokes and that but when it comes to serious matters we're all quite awkward. And I knew that this was going to be awkward and I didn't really want to face that. My mum, I could deal with, she's a lot better with stuff like this but I really didn't want to tell my dad. He's the suffer in silence type and I knew it would break him to learn about this, especially since he's going through the same thing.

So, to tell them, I bought a cake and a card to give my dad. They said, ""Congratulations! It's twins!"" with the diagnosis/outreach letter from my GP.

Reactions were mixed. My dad, while really upset, did find it funny. My mum is distraught and did not. Siblings are split, some found it funny, some found it insensitive to my parents. Personally, I thought it was funny but they did raise some good points. In the end though, it's mostly forgotten as they're all still in shock and focused on the diagnosis itself. It's been a couple days and I'm starting to think that maybe it was wrong of me to do it like that. I could've have just gotten over my awkwardness and had a mature conversation with my parents about it but it's too late for that now. AITA?

1fr0uus,AITA for not babysitting my sister’s kids pretty much every day?,"
So, I (21M) am childfree and have been very clear about that my whole life. My sister (33F) has three kids (8M, 5F, and 2M), and while I love them, I don’t want to be responsible for taking care of them.

Recently, my sister has been asking me more and more to babysit so she and her husband can ""have some time to themselves."" At first, I said yes occasionally because I felt bad for her. But then she started asking all the time, like every weekend. I finally told her I’m not comfortable with how often she’s asking and I can’t keep saying yes.

Well, she blew up at me, saying things like “family helps family,” and that I’m selfish for not wanting to help out when she really needs it. I suggested she hire a sitter, but she said she can’t afford one and that since I don’t have kids, I should be more available to help her out.

Now my parents are involved, and they're saying I should just help her because I’m not doing anything important with my time (I work full time but apparently, it’s “different” (because I don’t have kids). I’m feeling a lot of pressure to cave in, but I really value my free time and feel like I shouldn't be guilted into taking care of kids I didn’t choose to have.

1fph3xl,AITA for playing a role that my girlfriend doesn’t approve? ,"I (30m) have been with my girifriend (29) for almost four years. From since before we started dating I've been a part of an acting group mainly performing small venue comedy theatre once a year.
We have practice every Tuesday and after every practice I call my girlfriend to tell her about what we practiced. 
Why do I do that? Well, that's because she says she doesn’t trust them and that she’s afraid to lose me. 
I’ve agreed to steer away from taking parts that had a kissing scene or anything physical. I even told our director that I won't take any parts that include kissing, even if it's just a peck.

For our upcoming show I'm playing an older gentleman who’s married, father of the bride (the play takes part at a
wedding). He’s a whimsical dude with an eye for someone other than his wife. I let my girifriend read the script, because I don't want her to be upset or sad when she comes to watch. In a scene my character meets a girl that he used to be in love with in his teens. He declares his love and tries to win her over, but she completely brushes him off. He says the words ""I love you""
as she storms away. 
That scene made my girlfriend fall apart crying, saying that she can't stand ""watching her own
boyfriend saying he loves another woman"". Even if it's in a non-romantic, comedic setting.

I get it when it comes to kissing, and I have no problem turning down parts that has kissing scenes in them.. But saying ""I love you"" to a woman 25-30 years older than me in a comedy play act can't be that bad can it?

I told her I don’t know what to do other than quitting, but I really don’t want to do that.

1frra6r,AITAH for giving gluten to my gluten free mother without telling her,"So my mother and I don't have a great relationship. I recently moved to a new place in a really nice area because I just got a really nice new  job. Suddenly my mom really wants to come and visit and see me. I do my best to make up excuses, but she pushes so hard that eventually I cave.
  
  
I've been cooking a lot since I got here because I have a nice big kitchen all to myself. Recently I started making latiao. I love it.
  
  
Well, my mom and dad got here yesterday afternoon/evening and settle in and we start talking about dinner. As usual, mom has to pick after looking at online menus for a couple hours to make sure they fit with her dietary requirements. She ends up picking a vegan restaurant that's accross town, but she's just *so tired* from the drive up she can't fathom getting back in the car. So dad and I agree to go pick it up while she rests.

Driving accross my new city is a long process (which I told her ahead of time), and it's a little over an hour later when we get home with the vegan/gluten free food she wanted (she's not vegan, but she is adamantly gluten free and has been for a few years now). We get inside and as I am opening the food in the kitchen I notice the pyrex snapware container of Latiao that was in my fridge is now empty in my sink. She even dumped out the sauce that I'd been soaking them in.
  
  
I asked her if she'd eaten something out of my fridge while we were gone and she said that yes she had eaten some chicken because she was getting light headed from hunger, but it was terrible and she was so ready for some 'real food'. Now this is where I might have been the asshole; instead of telling her what she had actually eaten, I just rolled my eyes and dished up the food for everyone and we ate. She continued to remark about how bad and oily the ""chicken"" was all night. 
  
  
I finally snapped when she brought it up again first thing this morning when I was picking them up from their hotel. My mom made a joke about not wanting me to cook them breakfast because she didn't want more oily chicken or something to that effect.
  
  
I finally said ""mom, that was homemade latiao, and I don't understand why you ate ALL of it if you hated it so much."" She asked me what latiao is and I explained that it's essentially 100% gluten. I watched as her face dropped, and sure enough within 30 minutes her stomach was ""killing her"" and she was having difficulty breathing and needed to go to the emergency room.
  
  
The whole time we were there she went on and on to the nurses and doctors about how I'd fed her gluten and not told her until it was too late for her to take her medicine and crying because now the whole trip was ruined. Mind you, this is the hospital WHERE I WORK. My dad essentially told me to go home and think about my actions and give my mother some space, and now I'm just sitting here alone in my cool new place feeling like a dick and super anxious about what work is going to be like next week.
  
  
So, AITA?

1fhqimh,AITA for not giving washer and dryer away to brother-in-law and sister-in-law,"
I have a brother-in-law and sister-in-law that has owed my wife and me $1,200 for over three years now. They were struggling at the time and we let them borrow the money to get a place of their own with the expectation that they would pay us back quickly, although we really expected that they would give us $50 here and there until it was paid back, which we were fine with. Now, more than three years later, we have not received a dime and they avoid the subject. 

The other day, our four-year old dryer quit working and instead of dealing with the hassle of getting it repaired, we went out and bought a new washer and dryer set. We posted the old ones for free on FB marketplace. 

Almost immediately, my sister-in-law messaged that they wanted it, to which I replied that I would sell it to them for $1,200. She called my wife about the exchange and my wife was somewhat upset. I've temporarily taken the listing down, but I am adamant that they don't get it, especially since there is till a ton of value in them.

I'm not completely sure how I've gotten away with it, but I genuinely do not want people to know. A few months ago, I started buying myself goodnites. I still fit in the L size, and I didn't want to deal with wet sheets every day anymore. Like most months, I ordered myself some more since I was running out. 

I went to school and then went to practice. I came home to find that my box was 100% open, taken out of both fucking boxes and on display to the entire living room. I am absolutely mortified. 

My mom confronted me and I told her it was none of her business. I then started to curse at her and told her that I will move to my dads house if she doesn't leave me alone. I am 16 years old, and I most definitely do not want my mom to look through my packages that has my name on it on things I payed for with my job money. 

She told me I was being unreasonable and I needed to do some self reflection.

1fen91l,AITA for not eating my boyfriend's food when it's been out for too long?,"I've got a minor conflict with my boyfriend, we're both in our late twenties. I'm afraid of getting food poisoning, mostly because I really dislike vomiting or being nauseous. This is causing friction because my boyfriend has an habit of leaving food out at room temperature for a long time, here's some examples that I refused to eat:

* Rice left out at room temperature for 4 hours
* Vegetable soup left at room temperature overnight, but covered (he says no bacteria would get in, cover wasn't removed since it was boiling)
* Some sort of spongecake that had been left on the counter (covered) for two weeks
* Vegan spaghetti sauce in the fridge after two weeks

In all these cases, there was nothing visibly wrong with the food, it smelled as it should. I still refused to eat it. It's becoming a recurring issue, especially considering his family is like him in that regard while mine tends to throw away stuff super early. He often brings up that his family was like that all his life and they never got sick.

He also studied biology and often makes the point that nothing would grow in there, and I won't get sick.

1fmehjc,AITA for grounding my son and taking away his devices and internet access after snooping on his history,"I have a son who is 13 years old. He spends a lot of time on these devices and I always wondered what he does as he types a lot but doesn't play many games.

A few days ago I saw his computer unlocked and he was on reddit and in the process of posting to a sub a fake story that came across as very sexist. I memorized the username and it was a throwaway with no posts until later posted it.

Later when he wasn't there and left his laptop unlocked I basically went and checked his browser history and it was full of links to the create post link on reddit and posts made by throwaway accounts which I assumed were his. A lot of them were on this sub but also others and basically they were either outrageous opinions or stories with sexism and racism. Stuff about women drivers, women in tech, immigrants etc. I exported the history to a flash drive.

I confronted him and he initially denied it and then realized he was caught and got mad at me for snooping.

I took away his laptop, iPhone and iPad and will be getting him an apple watch with a plan for emergencies.

AITA here? He is saying it is unfair and he needs it for school etc but I will be letting him take them back with permission if he tells me what he needs it for.

1fsf79a,AITA for telling my Friend that her new military bf is probably full of shit?,"So my best friend(26)is seeing this new guy(21)who says he was in the army, he constantly goes on about it and has so many stories of everything he did. Now I called him out on maybe being to young for him to have really served but I also don't really know anything about it. But it just seems to unreal to me. He supposedly only was in combat training but didn't finish due to injuries. This is where his stories seem so un real, with him saving multiple fellow recruits from hurting themselves, to having canons shot off near his head which caused him a hearing injury, to a bomb exploding near him to the point it messed up his back, and stories of how they had to climb mountains carrying hundreds of pounds and sleep almost naked in -5 climate. Like I said I don't know much of what goes on in the army training but that seem so wild. I told my friend that it all just sounds like bull to me and she got extremely mad calling me a horrible person for looking down on a military man and how I was an AH. So I'm I just dumb and an AH?

Rainer and they stayed at a look out tower, they mentioned how it was very cold and it was a fun experience, then my best friends boyfriend chimed in with the story of climbing a mountain in below freezing temperatures and how they had to sleep almost with no clothes. And I suffer from depression and it came up in a conversation and he started talking about how he saved a fellow soldier who tried to hurt himself in training and how he still remembers all the blood.

1fq97jt,AITA for leaving my brother passed out in a luxury hotel and going back to sleep?,"Last month, I (21M) went on a family trip with my parents and my brother (26M) to a pretty high-end all-inclusive hotel.

Before I dive into the story, you should know that while my brother and I get along really well, we have our moments of friction. The main issue is that he’s the kind of person who lives life to the absolute fullest – which sounds great, but he tends to overdo it. Think of Barney from *How I Met Your Mother*, but in real life. There have even been a few times where he’s called me at 4 a.m. because he has no way of getting home after changing the plans and drinking too much (there’s no Uber in our city, FYI). He usually apologizes later and repays me in some way, but honestly, I’ve started avoiding going out with him too often because of this.

Now, in a fancy hotel with unlimited drinks, it was almost impossible not to go out at night, so I went with him. Before we left our hotel room, I told him, “Hey, I’m just having a few drinks and heading back early.” He agreed. We enjoyed some live music, had a few drinks, and by midnight, when the music ended, I reminded him that the bars closed at 2 a.m. and suggested we grab one more drink before heading back. He said sure. But after that last drink, he decided he wanted to stay out longer. I reminded him that we had family plans the next day and it wouldn’t be fun being hungover, but he pretty much ignored me. So, I left him and went back to the room to sleep.

Fast forward to 4 a.m., and the hotel room phone rings. I wake up, notice his bed is empty, and answer. It’s the lobby telling me my brother is wasted, passed out, laying down in a hallway, and had thrown up all over himself. They asked if someone could come help him. Still half-asleep and pretty pissed, I just hung up the phone, disconnected it, and went back to bed.

When I woke up around 9 a.m., his bed was still empty, and I had a bunch of missed calls from my parents. I called my mom, and she started yelling at me, asking why I hadn’t helped my brother. Turns out, my brother eventually made it to my parents’ room around 6 a.m., helped by two hotel staff members. Apparently, he had also broken a glass door, and they were charging my parents’ card for it. To make matters worse, the staff had told my parents they’d called our room first, and someone (me) had answered, only to hang up.

When I went to my parents' room, they tore into me for not helping my brother. What surprised me the most wasn’t their anger – they didn’t know the full context – but the fact that they didn’t seem upset with my brother at all, even though he was the one who caused all the chaos. My parents and my brother ignored me for most of the day, and we never really talked about the incident again. Eventually, the tension faded, but I’m left wondering…

After a few stops this old woman gets on, using a cane having trouble walking. I stood up and gave her my seat. 

The mom tried to get her kid in the seat id just left but I stopped them and said it wasn’t for the kid, it was for the lady. The woman then said that her kid needed a seat and that I was a b for not giving her one. 

I vented to my brother about this  when I got home and he said it was a bad move for me not to give my seat to the kid (who looked to be about 6) in the first place but was better of me to let the old lady have the seat. 

So AITA for not giving up my seat for the kid? ",BlueJaguar6,876,472,0.8500000238418579,0.1030430126283703,1727651503,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fshglt/aita_for_giving_up_my_seat_on_the_bus_for_an_old/,2024,9,AmItheAsshole,2024-09-29 23:11:43

1fqa3lh,AITA for taking my girlfriend home from the hospital?,"I (19M), have been house-sitting for the week and one of my rules was not to have my girlfriend (21F) over to the house. She currently lives in a shelter. Last night, she was feeling very ill and ended up blacking out on the floor of the shelter. She was rushed to the emergency room via ambulance, and I'm the only contact for her since she has no family or friends. I showed up last night around 11pm, and she was discharged from the hospital around 5am after concluding she didn't need an overnight stay at the hospital. Her shelter doesn't allow anyone to enter under any circumstances after 7pm nor allow anyone to enter before 8am, so I opted to take her to the house where I could make sure she was getting proper care and treatment after a long night of sitting in a busy emergency room. This morning I was met with extremely angry parents who disregarded the lack of normal circumstances and frowned upon my choices.

Of course, under normal circumstances I would've followed the rules. AITA for breaking those rules under an unforeseen emergency?

1fqzlq5,WIBTA if I returned my parents grad gift to them?,"I (22F) graduated from college last May and received a $25 Starbucks gift card from my parents (both 60) as a graduation gift. Now, I'm not someone who needs a huge gift or anything, but this hurt my feelings for other reasons. 

Firstly, though my parents don't care about this, I've been participating in the Starbucks boycott for months now (this has been incredibly easy for me for reasons that will become obvious). Secondly, even if I wasn't boycotting, I still wouldn't use the gift card. I don't like coffee or tea. I have never liked coffee or tea. This is something my parents know as I repeat it often when they ask if I want anything or to try their drink. I know that Starbucks sells food, but I honestly don't even like their food offerings that much, either. Especially not enough to go out of my way to get them. Lastly, my dad bought a bunch of gift cards from Starbucks for his company this past winter as part of a little raffle thing. I'm almost certain my parents gave me this gift card not because they went out of their way to get me something, but because they had it lying around. To be honest, that almost hurts more because it shows it wasn't even ""special"", it was just convenient. 

It's now been over four months and I still haven't used the gift card and have no plans to. Here's where I venture in AH territory. If I give it back to them (my dad goes to Starbucks like every other day so he would certainly use it), I know they'll ask where I got it. I see no point in lying to them, and I'd just tell them it was their graduation gift to me. As far as I can remember, and I've racked my brain, this was their only grad gift to me so it wasn't a part of something larger. I want to reiterate again that I don't expect a lavish gift, but it hurt my feelings to see how little thought my parents put into something for me. A selfish part of me wants them to know it hurt me and wants to hurt them back.

1fnvo9o,AITA for calling out my stepsister for acting like a brat in public?,"(Obligatory throwaway I've been using because I don't want it to be tied back to my personal life.)

Here's some backstory: 

My dad(52M) met my now stepmom, Janet(47F) when I(17F) was 10. She also brought in my two younger stepsiblings, Mike(13M), and Lindsey(17F). If I'm being honest, I actually really like Janet and Mike. The only person who I never took a liking to was Lindsey, mainly because she's a brat and it's gotten to the point where I don't like being seen with her at all, especially in public. She will start throwing actual childlike tantrums and will start pouting and being extremely rude to my parents if:

- We don't go to a restaurant she wants to go to when the rest of us agree on another place. 

- We want to see a movie that she apparently hates, even if it literally JUST came out.

- We use the bathroom (there's two, she just prefers the SLIGHTLY bigger one) when she needs it, even though we ask her if she needs to go beforehand. 

My parents say to just let her ride it out and ignore it, but it's so EMBARRASSING to be seen with this 17-year-old girl who is crying and yelling just because we can't afford to go to Starbucks, or whatever it is she wants in that current moment. 

The situation: 

We went to Applebee's the other day because my parents took us to a local fair and they didn't want to spend a bunch of money on fair food (and anyone who has ever been to a fair knows how ridiculously expensive it is). We were already teetering on the edge to a meltdown with her, because of course she didn't want to go to Applebee's, but Janet calmed her down and told her she could get whatever she wanted, within reason. 

So, we sit down, everything is going well and then the waitress comes over and obviously, asks what we wanted. I asked for a cheeseburger with fries, because it was on the cheaper side, but Lindsey wanted this BIG steak and a bunch of sides. Janet tells her to get one side and a smaller steak, and I guess that sent her over the edge. 

She started being so incredibly rude to Janet, saying how her dad would let her have it, that she was told she could have whatever she wanted by Janet, even though Janet said to keep it cheaper. Lindsey just kept talking about how she WANTS a bigger steak, she WANTS more sides, all the while this poor waitress is standing there looking nervous. So, I cut her off and said, ""You're lucky you're getting anything at this point, because you're acting like a giant ungrateful brat and it's so fucking embarrassing.""

She just stopped and went quiet, and the first five minutes after were a little awkward, but the rest of the dinner was fine. When we got home, Lindsey just went straight to her room and slammed the door (as usual when she doesn't get her way) but my dad stopped me before I went to my room and told me that while he sees where I was coming from, it was a bit of an asshole move to embarrass her like that in front of the other customers and the waitress. 

So reddit, was I really the asshole?",throwaway22383849,1770,275,0.959999978542328,0.091987828574963,1727126195,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fnvo9o/aita_for_calling_out_my_stepsister_for_acting/,2024,9,AmItheAsshole,2024-09-23 21:16:35

he suggested I work for him, David is self employed as a house hold cleaner, he makes a well living and I thought it was a nice offer and it would look good on a resume (considering all I’d have on there without it would be babysitting), 

well anyways I asked him what the pay would be and he said he’d pay me 15$ an hour and i happily excepted, I worked 25 hours a week for a month so I made 1,500$ but when I asked him when I’d be payed he asked me what I ment so I clarified and said “when will you be paying me for the 100 hours I worked” he looked at me like I was crazy 

I thought I got the hours wrong so I checked again and it was definitely 100 hours so I showed him the hours I worked and said “yeah one hundred see” and then he said “no I got what you mean but why would I be paying you?” 

And I froze for a moment before before I got mad and asked him why would he not be paying me and he told me that I was just helping him and being a good niece well his wrist heals (he sprained his wrist 3 months prior and it was fully healed)

I said that I wasn’t doing that work for free and if he wasn’t going to pay me like he said he would I would take him to small claims court, after that he got really quite and said he thought I was a better person and that family should help family.

1gg08k9,"AITA for not being friendly with my partners daughters now that they've ""warmed up"" to me","I'm (42) dating Tim (59), a widower. He's in banking, I'm a bartender. I know what it looks like. His 2 daughters thought the same thing, but he's broke as a joke and I've got a trust fund, so actually no.  
  
He's broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2^(nd) mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.  
  
His daughters live 6hrs drive away.  
  
We drove to them for Xmas last year and the year before. They ignored me, dragged Tim away when he tried to include me and prevented their husbands from making even small talk with me by talking over me.  
  
Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn't their Mum.  
Year 2, they did it again.  
  
This year I told Tim not again.  
He could go, I would never ask him not to see his daughters for Xmas but I'll stay here.  
  
Tim didn't love the idea because me going with him means we can share the responsibility of driving when his back starts to bother him. (He hates to fly)  
His 2010 deathtrap is starting to go anyway, so I leased him a comfy luxury ride (my brother has a dealership)  
  
He called the girls, super excited that he'd be able to see them more often without having to worry about his back,, who then blew up and accused him of spending their Mothers money on a “bull\*\*\*\* house and car to impress some bimbo bartender and didn't offer them a dime for their weddings”  
  
In the ensuing argument it came out that they assumed there had been a life insurance policy, nor did they have any idea about the credit card debt or the 2^(nd) mortgage that the house was underwater on or that Tim was looking at foreclosure and bankruptcy until he moved in with me.  
  
They did not realize it was my house, that he pays no bills save the water bill (man takes excessive showers) and shared groceries.  
  
Now the girls want my number. They are sorry I “felt lonely” at Xmas.

They want to come visit and stay with us next year! Conveniently in summer, I live near a beach.  
  
I've told Tim absolutely not about giving out my number. I'm happy to be polite if they come to visit Tim but, we're not going to be friends. If they had talked to me for even 2 seconds they'd have understood. I am not shy about admitting the only thing I have ever contributed to my blessed financial state is “not developing a crippling coke addiction” like my cousin Danny did.

  
Tim thinks I'm being too unforgiving. They would have warmed up to me eventually but knowing how generous I am being with their Father has made them warm up quicker.

1g1nodm,AITA for pouring my boyfriend's raw milk down the drain because I found out it's dangerous?,"So I recently found out that my boyfriend has been buying and drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk. He grew up on a farm and apparently his family always drank it straight from the cow, and he's been doing the same ever since we moved in together.

At first I didn’t think much of it (being a vegan I never drank it myself) but I started doing some research after I saw the label on it literally says ""not for human consumption"". Apparently raw milk can carry harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. I freaked out when I read that, I don't want him to get sick or expose me to something dangerous.

So, when I saw a fresh bottle of raw milk in our fridge yesterday I panicked and poured the entire bottle down the drain. I thought it was the safest thing to do.

When my boyfriend got home he immediately noticed and was pissed. He said he spent a lot of money on that milk and that he’s been drinking it for years without a problem. He accused me of not trusting him and said I had no right to throw away something he enjoys just because I disagree with it. I tried explaining that I was just concerned for his health and ours, but he said I was being a ""control freak"". Now he's barely talking to me and I feel like there’s this huge distance between us.

1fxu5wr,AITA For Ruining A Child's Life?,"Today, I started talking to an American mother while in A&E; her child was interested in the artwork I have on my leather jacket as it's pretty colourful. The mother mentioned that her daughters name was ""Grain"" so I assumed for a while that she was another mother who wanted something ""special"" to call her child. I remarked that it was a unique name and that I'd never met anyone called Grain before.
She told me that she's named after her great-grandmother and that it's an Irish name. At this point, the alarm bells are ringing in my head because I've realised that the kid is called Gráinne (generally pronounced as Gro-nyuh, or there abouts.) 
I tried to be very tactful, and I was like, ""Irish has such an interesting alphabet. How is her name spelled? Irish names can be tricky."" 
The kid is called Gráinne. Not Grain. 
My partner, who has studied Ireland's political history as part of their dissertation and also the Irish diaspora and it's culture around their university city,  is stuck somewhere between stifling a laugh and dying of embarrassment on her behalf so I come up with, what I thought was a very positive reply.
I said ""an old-school name and a more modern pronunciation. I think that's a great way to pick names."" I would like to point out that I do not like the name Grain for a child, nor do I like the way the pronunciation was butchered, but I was trying to be tactful and positive. She asked what I meant, and I said ""well in Ireland, they typically pronounce it like ""gro-nyuh"".""
Her face went red and said that I shouldn't have said that the pronunciation was wrong in front of the kid because now she's going to grow up knowing that her name is wrong and feel bad about it. I apologised for causing offence and restated that it's a lovely name in both ways and a fantastic nod to her heritage. I said that I'm sure her great-grandmother would be thrilled to be honoured by her name being used. I was throwing out just about every positive reinforcement that I could think of, but, to be frank, she was pissed off. 
She told me that I ""ruined her daughter's self-esteem"" and that her ""life [was] ruined"" by me saying that ""her existence is wrong."" I didn't say that, by the way. I said that her name was pronounced atypically. Gráinne, for context, was around 2 years old and completely unbothered by the conversation until her mother got angry at me. She was just looking at the pictures on my jacket. The conversation was maybe five minutes long, but I managed to ruin this kid's life. 
Hindsight says I should have kept my mouth shut and waited for somebody else in this city to say something. 

So, AITA?

1furzzy,AITA for refusing to cook a vegetarian Thanksgiving dinner?,"I feel like I’ve slipped into the twilight zone with this whole argument, so tell me what’s up, internet folks.

Background: I (31F) and my brother Mark (35M) do not get along. When he was a teen he saw a documentary on factory farming and decided to become a vegetarian. He got very, very annoying about it quickly, but my dad shut him down when he started trying to get the rest of us to be vegetarian with him.  Then he went to college, made a bunch of very strange friends, and went militantly vegan. It’s his entire personality. I stopped talking to him after he threw a fit about one of my birthday dinners being at a steakhouse and spammed my messages and SM with pictures of abused cows.

My parents have been trying to repair the situation and for a while, it did seem like Mark was getting better so I’ve been letting him back into contact gradually. Then he started dating Pam, who is some kind of vegan influencer. She is apparently moderately popular online, but I have no idea what she does exactly. I don’t know if Mark was trying to impress her or what, but last Thanksgiving he insisted that mom cook at least a vegetarian meal or they wouldn’t come on “ethical grounds”. My mom just wanted everyone to get along on her favorite holiday, so she agreed. It was not a fun meal.

This year, my parents have downsized for retirement and my mom is having health problems. I bought their house when they moved, so my mom asked me to host Thanksgiving so it would be like usual. I told everyone in the group chat so Mark and Pam could make travel arrangements and Pam immediately started gushing about all the vegan replacement recipes she could give me to replace the traditional ones.  I said to send me a main dish recipe they like and I would give it a shot, but I’m making the traditional meal otherwise and there should still be plenty of things they can eat.  Mark and Pam have been arguing about this with me for days and then Mark said that if I wouldn’t make a meat-free meal they wouldn’t come.  This upset my mom, who asked me to just make what she made last year to keep the peace, but I told her that Mark needs to get over himself and I’m not coddling him.  I’m having turkey on Thanksgiving.

My dad privately agrees with me, but Mark threatening to not come is upsetting my mom so much that he’s worried it will impact her health. There’s a not big, but also not zero chance that these might be some of the last family holidays we have with her. My mom thinks I’m putting turkey over my own family and I’m not so sure anymore.

AITA?

Edit: Whoa, this blew up.  So the answers to some common questions:

As I said, I’ve already offered to make sure there is a main dish and sides they can eat. Mark and Pam will not show up if anyone else eats meat at this meal. If any meat is served to anyone, they won’t come.

Doing multiple meals that day or across multiple days is a no go. I’m a newly minted critical care physician at an understaffed hospital during a major holiday week and I will have a limited window of time between shifts. I have time for one gathering and I would rather not waste it on a miserable one like last year.

Mark and Pam can’t host because they live in a van at present. I’m also not willing to have them in my kitchen for hours bitching about the meat in my fridge, the cookware and utensils, and whatever else they can find to complain about. The time it would take for them to come eat, socialize for a couple of hours, and leave is the maximum amount I’m willing to let them be in my home. Although it would admittedly be interesting to watch them try to host a family Thanksgiving out of a van.

It is very unlikely that my mom is going to die anytime soon.  It’s just a non-zero chance, she’s understandably worried about it, and is in the pessimism stage of grieving her health. She has a good prognosis and most people with her condition pull through and live for a long time afterward.

1ggrg1s,AITA for buying my own dinner because I don't like what the in-laws order? ,"I'd like to preface by saying that I am not a picky person. I don't just...turn down food. I'm always willing to try new things, even if they're weird or unconventional. One of my favorite things to do is to pick out something I've never tried in the grocery store.   
  
But my in-laws are hooked on this one take 'n bake pizza joint that I just cannot stand. I've tried to like it. I've ordered so many different things off of their menu. I just. Don't. Like it. They order it for every single family event. Every get together. Every holiday. Every birthday. 

I started ordering my own meals to bring to the parties. They got upset when they realized what I was doing. I explained that I LIKE ordering my own food, because it's a chance to get a treat for myself that I don't normally order. Still, they're always trying to convince my partner to get me to change my mind and just eat the same pizza as everyone else. 

This Halloween, we'd all planned to get together for a Halloween party. My partner and I had actually planned out a fun homemade meal (pasta bar) for everyone, but MIL became VERY upset that we weren't getting pizza. She put her foot down so hard that we thought there'd be an actual honest to God fight about it, so we told her she could order the take 'n bake she wanted. 

And of course, I was going to run to the store and get my own favorite pizza. She became SO angry. She insisted that I eat what she ordered, what everyone else was eating, and even offered to buy me ANYTHING that sounded good off the menu. I told her again that I don't like anything on the menu and that I'm perfectly willing to go and buy something that I do enjoy instead. 

She's still angry with me. FIL is angry with me. They tried again and again to convince me (they always do) to get something off the take 'n bake menu. 

But I just don't like it!

1g30yhm,AITA for shaming my sister for being pregnant and refusing to help her at all with any expenses ?,"AITA? I (24F) have a twin sister ""Ashley"" and we've always been close. She started dating this guy a year ago ""Jared"" (32M). I never really liked him but my sister was head over heels in love with him and said she wanted to marry him. This summer I was at the grocery store when a woman with three kids came up to me in the aisle and asked if I was Ashley. I said no and was about to say we're twins when she cut me off and said ""Yes you are. You're dating my deadbeat baby daddy and want to stalk my pages leaving hate messages saying he chose you over us and to move on. How heartless are you""? I was like WTF I am NOT Ashley,I'm her twin sister ""Blaire"" and asked if she was talking about Jared.


She said yes, and showed me the screenshots of my sister DMing her saying Jared is now hers, he doesn't claim those kids, blah blah. I was very uncomfortable but I knew in my gut he was a weirdo. I was so shocked my sister would date a deadbeat and proudly knowing how our father being a deadbeat sent us both to therapy. I just walked away. A few days later I asked my sister and she denied it at first then admitted it saying she didn't tell me he has kids since I personally don't date men with kids and she didn't want me to judge her. I told her I was judging the fact that he's a DEADBEAT, not a father. We argued about it a lot and I've looked at her differently since. 


Anyways this week she invites me over and her and Jared tell me she's pregnant and are both so happy. I just sit there silently and kept eating. She asked why I was acting like a bitch and why aren't I happy to be an aunt and I said because of and gestures towards Jared. He got mad and said ""What's your problem with me"" and I said because you're a deadbeat. They both got quiet and he said ""That doesn't mean I'll be one for this kid""...  at that point I laughed and got up to leave. I'm in the hallway on the way to the elevator when my sister comes running behind me and keeps asking why I'm being so rude while she's sobbing. I told her thatshe should be ashamed to be pregnant by a guy that abandoned his other kids knowing that happened to us and that she's disgusting and a loser and he's gonna leave her like he did did his ex. 


She said I don't know the full story and she can't believe I would be not supportive in this time of her life and the baby has half my DNA too. I felt bad and said I would try to be there for her but she'll realize what a mistake she made then I left. Now she's texting me saying she wants to be come back and apologize to Jared and I refused and she said that she doesn't want to speak to me if I don't apologize to them.

1fvl31q,WIBTA for not following a dress code at a bachlorette?,"My friend is having her bachlorette in two weeks.

I am currently six months pregnant.

Tonight, a bridesmaid put on the group chat that we will all need to be in barbie pink so the bride can wear white and stand out.

Ever since I started showing I have had a nightmare with getting clothes to fit. I've tried six maternity shops but nothing has sat right on me, I think because I'm really tall the bump part of the clothes doesn't fall on where my bump is.

I've settled for having four stretchy knit dresses that I fit into. These are all dark and not pink.

I messaged the bridesmaid and said I'm going to really struggle to find an outfit in barbie pink, as almost nothing has fit me.

She said this isn't about me and if I cared about the bride I'd make it work.

1fx1yuv,AITA for Refusing to Let My Brother’s Kids Stay at My House After He Got Evicted?,"So, I (23F) just moved into a new apartment in a pretty nice area after getting a promotion at work. I worked hard for this place, and it’s the first time I’ve ever lived alone. I’m really proud of it.

Here’s where things get complicated. My older brother, “Jake” (31M), has always had a bit of a chaotic life. He’s a good guy, but he and his wife don’t really manage their money well. They’ve always been living paycheck to paycheck, and with the rising rent costs, they recently got evicted from their apartment. They have two kids, ages 4 and 6.

Jake asked me if they could stay with me temporarily until they figure things out. Now, I’m not heartless, but my apartment is a one-bedroom. I barely have enough space for myself, let alone for four other people, two of whom are little kids. Plus, I’ve never had kids around, so I don’t know the first thing about taking care of them or childproofing my place.

I offered to help them financially — I could contribute to a short-term rental for them or even let them stay in a hotel for a while. But Jake and his wife insist that staying with family would be easier and less stressful, especially for the kids.

The thing is, I’m not comfortable with the idea of having my peaceful space completely turned upside down. I don’t think it’s my responsibility to accommodate their poor planning, and it honestly feels unfair to me. But now my parents and other family members are calling me selfish and saying I’m putting my “fancy apartment” above family. They’ve been guilt-tripping me, saying things like, “Family helps family in times of need,” and “Think of your nieces!”

I love my brother and my nieces, but I’m standing firm on my decision. Now everyone’s angry at me, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m being unreasonable.

1gcwl1t,AITA for Telling My Wife Her Parents Will Die,"I (39 M) and my wife (36 F) have been together for 14 years and have what I consider a great marriage. We very rarely have arguments and in general have a pretty good life. 

My wife had a pretty good, middle class childhood, no major issues other than the typical stuff you experience as you grow up. Her parents were loving and did the best they could for her and her brother. There are no buried secrets or hidden abuses, I don't believe either my wife or her brother ever even got spanked.  Her parents are divorced but still on great terms with one another and with the family at large. They live about 1,200 miles away from us so we don't see them as often as I would like. Her parents have always been there for us and on more than a few occasions have helped us financially when we needed it. Honestly they are a somewhat boring Hallmark channel family and I cherish it. 

Shortly after getting married my father passed away and my mother passed about a year later. I was very close to both of them and the loss was terrible. I often think about every time I didn't pick up the phone to call them or would put off a visit because I'd ""do it next time"". 

My wife is really terrible about being in contact with her family, but especially her parents. She just... doesn't make an effort. I will often ask her if she has spoken to anyone and she just says ""I will later"" and then never does. Sometimes weeks go by and she won't reach out to them at all. Her mother made a comment once that she knows everyone is busy but she wished her children would reach out a little more. It drives me crazy that she just doesn't try- there is no reason. I could understand if they had been bad parents or had done something to her but that isn't the case. When I ask her why she won't do it she says she doesn't need to. 

I told her a few weeks ago that I encourage her to speak to her parents because I miss mine terribly and I really regret every missed opportunity. I just don't want her to have the same regrets. She said just doesn't feel that way and kinda moved on without saying much more. 

Her parents sent us some money to cover an unexpected medical bill and I thanked them but told my wife she really should reach out and at least say thank you. She said she would ""later"". I am embarrassed to say that I got angry and I said "" You know, they'll be dead some day and there won't be a later!"" She began crying and told me that I was cruel and should never have said something like that. I apologized to her profusely and again told her I just have my own baggage from my parents and it gets to me sometimes. I told her I just want her to use the chances she has now. She told me she will never be able to forgive me and that she will always ""think about how cruel"" I was to her. I know I messed up but I still don't understand why she can't just speak to her parents. AITA?

1fxtzjf,AITA for telling my friend I won't be inviting her out anymore?,"So my bf tells me im not the asshole but I feel like I may be. So I F23 have a friend I'll call Mary who's 22. She and I work together and became friends. Well this past Saturday, I invited her out with my friend group to go to a local amusement park that goes all out for Halloween 

Mary asks if she can bring her kids a 5 year old boy and an 18 month old girl. Everyone involved tells her it's really not a good idea as this park and it's haunted attractions are not geared towards children and we're planning on being there until it closes which is midnight.

She seems to accept this but asks repeatedly throughout the week leading up to Saturday and she is again told no. Well Saturday arrived and as you can guess, she brought her kids. Other people in our group asks her why and she just shrugged saying she thought the kids would have fun.

They didn't, her son got scared with in about 10 minutes of us getting into the park and began to cry begging to go home to which Mary tells him to calm down and he'll have fun eventually. We get in line for the first haunted house and her son again starts to cry saying he doesn't want to go into the house. Mary then asks myself if I'll stay and watch her son and daughter so she can go into the haunted house. 

I tell her no and that this is why we told her not to bring her kids. She gets upset and drags her very scared child through the haunted house. He had a melt down and had to be carried out. This repeats through every single haunted house we attempted to go through.

Around 11:30, my boyfriend pulls me aside and tells me that he can't take anymore of the screaming/crying and we try to break off to find a place to calm down, Mary sees this and leaves her son and daughter with us while she runs off to go on a ride. Her son gets scared by an actor chasing people with a chainsaw and has an epic melt down. I'm doing the best I can to console him but I am rapidly running out of patients. Finally his mom comes back and I all but shove her son back into her arms 

I tell Mary that my bf and I were leaving along with the rest of our group. She gets huffy but agreed. We leave the park and go to waffle House for dinner. At this point it's midnight and both kids are extremely tired and upset. They cry all through dinner and Mary did nothing to calm them down. Finally at the end of my rope, once we get out of the restaurant I lose my temper. I tell Mary that this is why she was told not to bring her kids to this event and that I will not be inviting her back out again if she can't follow the rules of the group. Mary got upset and has since blocked me and the other people who agreeded with me. No one in the group agreed with Mary but they all did say that I didn't need to say anything about it to her and I didn't need to tell her I wasn't inviting her out again.

1fylhno,AITA for replacing my friend’s throw pillow with a thrifted identical version? ,"So my (24F) friend “Wendy” (23F) just got a new apartment. She’s the first of our friend group to get an apartment, so everyone is really excited and Wendy wants it to be the main place we all go to hang out. Wendy threw a party this past Friday, just a small get together with our friend group and some of Wendy’s cousins. 

After a few hours, we were all pretty drunk, including me. I accidentally spilled my wine on one of her throw pillows. I tried to wash it out, but no luck. Of course, I offered to replace the pillow and Wendy sent me the link to where she bought it. It was SEVENTY DOLLARS for a tiny little carrot pillow. I told her I would definitely replace it, but I would probably have to wait for a few weeks for my next check because that eats into my gas money. She seemed a little pissy and I felt bad.

Yesterday, my other friends wanted to go thrifting for their Halloween costumes. I already got mine, but wanted to tag along. I thought it was my lucky day because at one of the thrift stores was the exact pillow! Like the very same one with the tag from the store and everything. The thrift store was selling it for twelve dollars, so I got it because it was cheaper and now Wendy would be able to have her complete living room quicker than we thought.

Fast forward a couple hours and we all go over to Wendy’s to show her the Halloween haul and I present her with the pillow. First she was happy, but then she was like “How are you gonna get to work?” I explained that I found it at a thrift store and she threw it at me and acted all grossed out.

Now I’m confused because we all go thrifting all the time, including Wendy. But Wendy was like, “I don’t buy soft furnishings at the thrift store.” I offered to wash it and bring it back, but she said no and still demanded that I buy the one from the actual store. I said no, I would wash the thrifted pillow for her, but I’m not buying a pillow for seventy dollars. She said it was my fault for spilling wine in the first place and said I was “too clumsy to live.” Then I said for someone who wants to host parties, you’re being a big brat about a little spill. 

We left it at that, but I left a few minutes later because I could tell Wendy was really annoyed at me. Now the friend group is taking sides and one of my friend’s girlfriend told me that now there’s a group chat that doesn’t have me or Wendy in it called “The Pillow Crisis of 2024” where everyone is arguing who is in the right. 

I did wash the pillow and gave it to my friend to give it to Wendy, but apparently she refused to put it on her couch and it now resides in the floor pillow pile. So, AITA?

(tl;dr: I spilled wine on my friend’s very expensive throw pillow. I replaced it with the identical pillow from the thrift store at a lower price. My friend wasn’t happy and demanded that I buy it from the actual store. I refused and insults were thrown back and forth. AITA?)

1fu2lm5,AITA for not paying for private school tuition for GF's special needs child?,"This is throwaway because everyone knows my main.

The conflict is between me (44M) and my girlfriend (34F). My GF and I have been together for 5 years, living together for 2 years. She has a son (12M) from a previous relationship. Her son has ASD. In my early 20s, I started a business with my best friend. It has done very well and I am comfortable financially. I was previously married, and when I got divorced, ex took more than her pound of flesh financially. So, when I got with my GF, I told her, her expenses where her expenses, my expenses were my expenses. And we would never get married. She agreed and understood.

My GF's son previously went to a local private school. This school provided lots of resources for kids with special needs. He thrived there. My best friend's kids go to the same school. They are not special needs, but the school is good overall regardless of that. My GF's son's tuition was paid for by his bio dad and GF's dad. 

Here is where I might be the AH. My best friend, a couple of years ago, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. He unfortunately died this past spring. I promised him I would look after his wife and kids. About a year ago, GF's ex (the bio dad) lost his job and can no longer contribute to tuition. GF's dad cannot cover it (bio dad paid like 85%). So, GF's son is in public school right now and struggling. Meanwhile, I am paying the tuition for best friend's kids based on my promise to him. GF approached me and asked if I would contribute something so her son could go back to the school. I refused. She called me an AH because I am helping a woman who I am not in a relationship with while refusing to give her the exact same help. I see her point, but we had an agreement when we got together.

One of my friends has a service dog for his anxiety, which I totally respect. But I told him beforehand that I can’t be around dogs because of my allergies.

1gaoypm,AITA for telling my husband I won’t be going to his birthday dinner since he asked if I would leave early anyway?,"For context, I will be 38 weeks pregnant on my husband’s birthday this year. 

The previous week, I reluctantly allowed his sister to pick my daughter up from school so she could spend the day with her and his parents (she does half days still). I say reluctantly because they have continuously crossed parental boundaries in the past, but that’s a different story. It had been a while, and she loves them and I truly want them to have a relationship, so I gave it another go. 

Anyway, my husband and I went to pick her up at his parents and while there, his sister asked what he was doing for his birthday coming up. I had asked him a number of times already what he wanted to do, had thrown out some ideas for us to do as a family as well, but he never decided on anything. So, he says he doesn’t have plans. She asked if he wanted her to make him dinner at her apartment then and he said yeah, that sounds good. It would be a family dinner: his parents, her partner, and our family. All good. 

Tonight, he said that we could drive separately because he doesn’t want to leave early. He asked me at dinner if I would leave early with our daughter so I could put her to bed. He wants to stay and drink and smoke and be up late. 

This majorly upset me because this whole pregnancy has not felt like a partnership what so ever. He only made one of my several ultrasounds (I’m over 35, so get a good amount of them), works almost every weekend voluntarily vs. making plans with my daughter and I, put off doing things I physically cannot do for the nursery until the third trimester I’ve been asking him to do since the first. I’ve also asked him to look into ways he can support me during birth and not a single google search has been made to that effect. 

I’m not sure if I’m being the crazy pregnant lady, but it certainly feels like he just wants to do whatever he wants without any regard to me carrying this child he told me desperately wanted (I was fine with one). Our birthdays are close, the baby’s due date is only two days after mine (so I’ll be 40 weeks for my birthday if  she doesn’t decide to arrive before then). 

So for my birthday, I don’t get to do anything but be pregnant and wait for baby. It would be nice to feel like he wants to spend these special occasions with me/my daughter and I. He clearly is not empathetic to the fact that I can’t go out and do these things for this period of time, so to be told to go home he can is hurtful. 

I told him that in that case, I don’t even want to be there and she (my daughter) and I aren’t going to dinner. Honestly, I would not be in a mood to celebrate and just get upset anyway. But it does constantly feel like as much as he claims to be a family guy, spending quality time with us doesn’t matter to him.

1g61v0o,"AITA for refusing to let my neighbor cut down my tree because it ""blocks her view""?","I (34M) live in a quiet suburban neighborhood, and my house has a large oak tree in the front yard. It’s been there for decades, long before I moved in, and honestly, it’s one of the things I love about the property. It gives shade, keeps the yard cool in the summer, and just generally looks great.

Recently, my new neighbor (40sF) moved into the house across the street. She seems nice enough, but we don’t really talk much, just the occasional wave. A couple of weeks ago, she knocked on my door and asked if I’d consider cutting down my tree. I was confused and asked why, and she said it “blocks her view of the sunset.”

Now, I’ve lived here for years, and I’ve never had any complaints about the tree, from neighbors or otherwise. It’s perfectly healthy, and it’s not hanging over anyone’s property. Plus, I enjoy the view with the tree, and it’s part of the charm of my yard.

I politely told her that I wasn’t interested in removing the tree, especially for something like that. She got annoyed and said it’s a “reasonable request” because the tree “ruins” her evening view from her porch. I didn’t want to escalate things, so I just said I’d think about it and ended the conversation.

A few days later, she came back with pamphlets from a tree removal service and tried again, this time offering to pay for the removal. I declined again, saying that the tree’s important to me and I don’t want to get rid of it. She got visibly upset and said something like, “It’s just a tree, why are you being so difficult?”

Since then, she’s been giving me the cold shoulder, and I’ve heard from a couple of neighbors that she’s been telling people I’m being unreasonable. I honestly don’t think I am, but now I’m wondering if I’m missing something.

1gf6i1t,AITA for refusing to invite my brother’s fiancée to my wedding because of her Instagram account?,"So, here’s the situation. My (28F) wedding is coming up in a few months, and I’ve been planning it for over a year with my fiancé, Jake (29M). Everything’s been going smoothly—except for one major issue with my brother’s (30M) fiancée, *Amber* (27F).

Amber has a large following on Instagram, where she posts very revealing photos of herself. She’s been into “fitness modeling” for a few years now, and while I have no issue with her career, I feel uncomfortable with some of the attention it brings. For example, at my engagement party, she showed up in a tight mini-dress and spent half the night live-streaming the event to her followers, some of whom were commenting… let’s just say *inappropriately*. I didn’t say anything then, but it made me feel awkward.

Jake and I have been envisioning a fairly private and family-oriented wedding. We don’t want anything about it going on social media, and we also don’t want Amber’s followers gawking at our wedding photos or seeing our special day as just another “shoot” for her profile. I spoke to her privately and asked if she’d agree to keep her phone away during the ceremony and reception. She brushed me off, saying, “It’s my brand. It’s who I am,” and she made no promises.

This has been weighing on me a lot, so I told my brother that if she can’t respect my request, I’d prefer she not attend. He exploded and accused me of judging her lifestyle and her career. He also said that if she can’t come, he might not come either, and now my whole family is furious with me. Jake supports me, but he’s worried it’ll cause permanent damage with my brother.

When I was 6 my mom bought me different blanket sets for the hospital since their blankets are uncomfortable and sometimes I have to use them at home if she’s behind on washing my bedding. I used to love them but now I hate them. I had a princess set, unicorns, butterflies, and flowers. I “accidentally” stained the princess set so she donated it but now I’m stuck with the unicorns, flowers, and butterflies. I asked her to get me new ones because mine are for little kids and she said yes then she changed her mind and said I need to wait because she had to find a new school for my sister and there’s a lot of extra expenses right now. She said if I want them I can use my charity money but I already had stuff that I wanted to get with that money so I called my grandma and asked her to get me new blankets. She said yes and told me to send her the sets I wanted. 

She dropped them off at my house when I had to go to the hospital and my mom asked about it. I told her my grandma agreed to buy them for me so I don’t need to spend my charity money on it. I told her we can give the blanket sets to the little kids at the hospital. Some of them are there even more than I am. 

She tried to make me give my grandma my allowance money but my grandma didn’t let her.

In the middle of everything, there was a woman sitting on a bench with her dog. Whenever any dog or person got near she would yell at them to get away and she would yank her dog back. The dog kept trying to make friends and would stare longingly at the other dogs who were playing with each other and she would keep aggressively tugging him and scolding people. After a while I said ""You know there's kind of a big dog party going on. If you don't want your dog around people or dogs, perhaps this is not the right place for you."" She said ""I don't know what you want from me. I have a right to be here."" I wasn't questioning her rights, just her judgment. AITA?

Edit: It was an official park sponsored party. She would get angry when people and dogs were simply in the vicinity of her dog, not necessarily even interacting. Most of the time she wasn’t even paying attention, just scrolling on her phone.

1g6tspt,"AITA for refusing to let my coworker move in after she got evicted, even though I have a spare room?","I (28F) recently moved into a nice two-bedroom apartment on my own after saving up for years. I have a good job and wanted a space where I could finally have peace and privacy. I’ve been enjoying having a place that’s just mine, and I turned the second bedroom into a home office.



Last week, one of my coworkers (32F), who I’m friendly with but not super close to, was evicted from her apartment. She came to me in a panic asking if she could move into my spare room “just for a couple of months” while she gets back on her feet. I felt for her situation, but I’ve been really enjoying my space and value my privacy. I explained that I’m not comfortable with someone else living with me and suggested she check out some short-term rentals or ask her family.



She got really upset and accused me of being selfish, especially since she knows I live alone with a whole empty room. She told some of our coworkers, and now a few of them are giving me side-eye and making comments about how I could “easily help” but just don’t want to.



I don’t feel like I should have to let anyone into my personal space, even if they’re in a tough situation. But now I’m starting to wonder if I’m being cold-hearted.

1fyjc8z,AITA for leaving concert early?,"My wife is a huge PINK fan, and has seen her in concert 5 times. I also quite like Pink, and I went to 2 of those shows and enjoyed them immensely.

Unfortunately, the third time wasn't the charm.

Months in advance of the concert last night, my wife bought 4 tickets, 2 for us, 2 for a couple of her friends. It was a beautiful day, we had no traffic or parking problems, and got to our (very good) seats as the opening acts were starting. Everything was good. None of us particularly cared about the openers, so it wasn't a big concern that the sound was muddy and all loud bass during those performances. I knew from past experience that the acoustics for Pink would be great. It would be well worth waiting thru 3 hours of noise to see her.

I was wrong.

About 50 minutes into Pink's performance, wherein I could only make out about every third word she sang, and couldn't hear her vocal range at all. I felt tremendously disappointed, and gave my wife the car keys and said I was going home (a 4 mile walk.) (She and her friends were enjoying the concert far more than I was.)

Today, my wife is angry at me. ""You ruined it for me."" ""You embarrassed me in front of my friends."" ""I could have spent that $300 on someone who WANTED to see the show."" When I responded that me leaving didn't affect her seeing the show, I was told, ""You don't care about my feelings at all."" I asked, ""What about my feelings?""

She refused to discuss it further, and is just still mad at me.

Should I have stayed and been miserable myself for 2 more hours? (I absolutely would have done that, if we'd gone alone. With her friends there, I didn't think I was ""abandoning"" her.)

This is my first time posting on reddit, so I'm not sure what to expect, but I'll appreciate any constructive criticism about whether I was in the wrong or not.

1g7ki0p,AITA for not letting my sister move in with me when she and her kids were facing homelessness?,"
Here’s a little bit of back story

In 2022, my sister (22F) had asked if she, her boyfriend (23M) and her newborn (6mo F) could stay with us for 1-3 months (which turned into 11 months) until they had gotten their taxes so they could save up and move to another place.

my partner and I agreed (21F & 20M) because it was only going to be a few months and I didn’t want them to be potentially homeless, with an infant. I had only 3 actual rules. A.) Take care of the wood floors B.) Help out with rent when they can C.) No births. 

My sister stayed home with the baby mostly, while us 3 worked through the day. But soon, so we’re consistently piles of dishes, dirty diapers, food trash, and just things left around.  And they had also spent all their tax money and asked if they could stay longer. 

After a while, my sister was getting really comfortable with asking me to watch my niece. I would end up watching my niece almost every night/off day for 1-5 hours. It got to the point where my partner and I couldn’t really hang out. Them living with us was starting to have an affect on mine and my partners relationship at that point. 

She had gotten prescribed birth control. Shortly after, I started to notice a bunch of ovulation tests in our bathroom. 

Not long after that appointment She happily came up to me and showed me a positive pregnancy test. She tried to lie and say that she was too fertile for birth control to work.m and said that it was accident. But it was so hard to believe. So then I told them both, they had to leave before that baby was born. 

When they moved out, Her boyfriend literally said to me before they left “wow your house looks TRASHED!” And then left. Their bedroom floors were super sticky, random substance on the walls, and a shit ton of dirty dishes were left For me to clean up. 

Now, it’s been about a year and a half since they left. And currently, my partner is having some heart issues causing him to be out of work and will need surgery. So I’m riding solo to keep a roof over our head, bills paid, and food in the fridge. 

My sister called me in a panic. Saying that her and her two babies that are now toddlers are going to be homeless because she was  on a waitlist for a rental assistance apartment And that she had done everything she could, and her boyfriend had been having issues keeping a job because he has a felony. And she had asked if she and my niece and nephew could stay with me for a few weeks. 

But I told her, no. I couldn’t take on anymore responsibilities than what I already have. That I’m having difficulty keeping up with my own shit. I suggested if they could reach out to her boyfriends parents, and see if they could help in any way. They agreed to let them stay. I called to check up on them, no response (which is very very unusual for her) and I feel like she may be upset with me, I just frankly have so much going on that I couldn’t go through that again.

1g3s5vz,AITA for refusing to switch seats with my girlfriend on a plane to make her more comfortable?,"This past weekend, I 23M and my girlfriend “Julie” 24F took a weekend trip. We’re both students so we had to budget where we could, so we bought basic economy tickets and just took whatever seats they assigned us. They were both middle seats, which was expected, but when we boarded the plane home, it was obvious that one seat was much better than the other.

Julie was assigned to a seat between a morbidly obese man who was spilling into her seat, and a woman on her other side who wasn’t as huge but was still quite big. My seat was next to two normal sized people. The thing is, I’m pretty big–6’5” and 220 with broad shoulders. Julie isn’t tiny herself–she’s 5’10 and 165–but obviously she’s much smaller than me. Julie immediately asked if we could switch seats, to which I said no. I knew Julie would be uncomfortable in the seats, but I don’t even think I could fit between the passengers on either side of her. After some arguing back and forth, Julie sighed and went to her seat.

I thought it wasn’t a big deal, but Julie was very cold to me when we landed. I offered to get us dinner on the way out but she said her back hurt from the flight and she wanted to lay down. I got the hint that she was upset about the seating arrangement. I told her it wasn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things and it was only a 2 hour flight, and that it’s better her than me because she’s smaller. She told me to drop it and just drive her home. 

That night, I went to hang out with some of our mutual friends (Julie had originally planned on coming with too, but she did not come). They asked where Julie was and I told her she was upset with me. When I told them why, the general consensus was that I should have switched seats with her because it was the chivalrous thing to do, though some people agreed Julie was overreacting. They said it wasn’t about who was bigger, it was about me protecting my girlfriend. Now I kinda feel like a dick and like I should apologize. Was I wrong for not switching seats with Julie?",No_Elk_5321,910,1144,0.8100000023841858,0.1001980795292451,1728943558,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g3s5vz/aita_for_refusing_to_switch_seats_with_my/,2024,10,AmItheAsshole,2024-10-14 22:05:58
1g3sfh5,WIBTA if I told my best friend her wedding sounds like a nightmare?,"So my (27/f) best friend ""Claire"" (27/f) is getting married in February. I'm the maid of honor, which is making me feel like I'd be a super asshole for saying anything.

They're having a small wedding, about 50 people and they're having it at a family members property near a lake. Which is all great, no problems with that.

The nightmare part is the fact that this 50 person wedding is an ALL DAY event. They're having a rehearsal brunch at 10am instead of a rehearsal dinner. And then their ceremony is at 12:30pm. And then they have ""group activities"" scheduled from 2pm-7pm (they've listed cornhole as an example) finally, at 7pm, we eat dinner and the reception is supposed to last till 10:30pm. 

And finally, it's a completely dry wedding. And I had zero objection to the dry wedding until they sent me this agenda. I don't think I need alcohol to have fun. But to spend 12 hours in a nice dress and heels, running around with 50 people I either don't know or barely know (it's mainly family, I'm the only friend from our high school group invited, so I really only know her parents, I've met her fiancee twice), I think I'm going to need at least 2 glasses of wine. 

I feel like an asshole, because it is her day and I love her, but I really think this sounds like a disaster. If I'm just sounding snooty and stuck up, please tell me. I don't want to be a jerk to my best friend.

I told him that he needs to finish the season since he made the decision to join the team, and quitting now would let his teammates down.

1gcvqwf,AITA because i refuse to drive my coworkers home without compensation?,"I (25M) have been offering/accepting requests from coworkers to give them a lift home whenever possible. I never asked for any compensation since it is only about a 15-20-minute detour.   
But, about a month ago, I finally had the opportunity to buy a new car. Beforehand, I had a 1999 Ford Fiesta; it was my first car, and I barely spent any money on gas.   
I don't have many financial responsibilities, so I chose to enjoy being a young man with a decent salary and bought a supercar. I LOVE my new car, and so do my coworkers, which means a lot more requests started coming my way for lifts home.   
I've worked at my current job for about 6 months, and I've probably done over 100 detours to make my coworkers happy.   
Here's the problem; not ONCE have I been offered any form of compensation from any of them, even though they would've had to pay for public transport, if I didn't offer them a lift.   
Now, my new car is quite a bit more expensive than my old one, which means it does not drive that far km/l (approx 12-13 km/l). 

Apparently, this is completely otherworldly for my coworkers. Today, I said no for the first time. I got asked if I could give them a lift, and I said: (sure, if you pay me the fee you would have to for public transport, I'll drive you home), and this did not sit well with them.   
I think I'm being as fair as possible, since I don't want to keep losing money by giving them a free service, that they don't seem to appreciate.   


So, AITA because I won't give free lifts to my coworkers anymore, since it's becoming a financial burden on me?

It wasn’t horrible and our parents did in all honesty a great job with all us.  I think really the only problem we had was Aiden who was the first out and knew he was the first out had a pretty big ego and felt he was superior over the other four of us and tried to push us around. Our parents did what they could to keep him inline and for the most part the rest of us would ignore him

Three years ago my brother decided to marry his then girlfriend. Our family for the most part are pretty laid back. This is good because out of the five of us, I’m the gay one. Up to a certain point it was never really an issue.  Or so I thought.   His wife’s family complete opposite. Highly political (Conservative) and devote Catholic. Again to each their own and it wasn’t anything for us to talk to him about.  If she makes him happy then there isn’t anything we can do about it.  When they got married I wasn’t included in any part of it.  Her parents were paying for it and they had the final say and said they couldn’t allow a gay person in the wedding party or in the church. My brothers, sisters and parents say they fought to get me invited, but were shot down each time.  My sisters were part of the wedding party but none declined.  My dad offered to stay with me for the day and we would do something.  I told him it was okay and both parents needed to be at the wedding.  The day of the wedding a couple of friends took a day trip.  We had a great time but it still would have been nice to see Aiden get married.

Not long after the wedding I was on vacation and met someone.  Long distance as it maybe three years later we have been making it work.  We have been talking about one of moving and I told him I loved Seattle and that if anyone was going to move it was going to be me.

Last night mom and dad asked for all of us to come for dinner.  I didn’t say much at all and everyone was talking and I was just listening and on occasion say a yes or no or answer an easy question. My dad finally noticed and looked over and asked if I was okay.  I just told him I have a lot on my mind and he asked what’s going on “I’m moving to Seattle  The room went crazy.  I can’t say I was being attacked but it still felt like it with the way everyone was firing off all their questions and calling me an asshole for breaking the five of us up. Dinner ended shortly after and Dad and I went out to his barn and talked for a long time.  Weather he gave it to me or not I am going to move.  But he gave me his blessing and told me he would help however he could.

Today Deanna and Beth came over and started in right away.  They started blaming Will for splitting the five of us up and calling me an asshole for not taking the rest of us into consideration. I told them it’s not a big deal and at least one of us has the ambition to move on with their life.

They basically just disappear into their own worlds the whole day (one goes to work and the other works at home). 

I don’t mind helping out for a few hours here and there but being expected to just watch her the whole day during the whole vacation (if I don’t have plans outside of the house) seems excessive to me and I find myself growing very resentful. I honestly don’t understand what they do when I’m not around as they don’t have a babysitter normally. Whenever I express that I’m tired or try to get away for some rest, they end up commenting later on in a “joking” way how me and my husband should reconsider having kids in the future since we get tired so easily. Or that we should watch my niece for a longer period of time (I.e. weeks) before seriously considering a child. These comments rub me the wrong way and seem so inappropriate to me because obviously having a child is a lot of work, but just because I don’t want to watch their child 24/7 doesn’t mean they can say such rude things to me. 

I’ve complained to my husband a few times but he seems to think that this is all normal and that this level of expectation for babysitting is also totally normal and “part of the culture” (they are south Asian). However I’m not really sure if this is the case because the tried to have their other sibling (sister) who lives in the same city agree to scheduling babysitting their kid one to two weekends every month and they obviously refused leading to a small fight. 

Recently I got so annoyed at their behavior over the past few trips (especially leaving their child with me and my husband when we have been feeling unwell and sick), that I told my husband that I don’t like his brother and think that him and his wife are extremely self centered and demanding people who are bad parents because they are always trying to pawn their kid off on other people. This obviously started a big fight as my husband feels close to his brother.

1g5b2n3,AITA for asking someone if they're still a therapist and telling them to consider a different career path?,"Sorry if this is rant-y, I'm just livid.

I (24F) posted a picture of my husband (25M) enjoying a chocolate milkshake after he had a surgery to put in a port. He hasn't had much of an appetite for weeks so him just having a milkshake was SO exciting to me. Well, a former family friend ""Cathy"" (in her 60s) had an opinion about that. She sent me a long text about being more considerate with what I share and that people won't appreciate seeing us ""splurging on expensive sugary and fatty"" milkshakes after we asked for some help earlier this week.

Yes, it's true that we made a small meal train to help us get through this week. That's the only help we asked for. Not a dime, just some comfort meals and prayers.

We went back and forth a bit. She then went on this rant about how she never asked for help when her house flooded... as if that's at all comparable to my husband starting cancer treatment. I shouldn't have kept responding to her and should have just blocked her immediately, but I didn't, and at some point I asked her if she was still a therapist, which she claimed was a ""personal attack"". 

I told her to consider a different career path and to remove herself from our lives. She said I was an AH for responding that way to her ""sharing her concerns.""

1g9w3ka,AITAH for refusing to bail my girlfriend's brother out of jail?,"Hi everyone, I need some perspective on a situation that happened recently. My girlfriend and I have been together for about three years, and things have generally been great. However, a few weeks ago, her brother got arrested for a DUI. This isn't his first run-in with the law, and he's been in and out of trouble for years.

My girlfriend called me in a panic, asking if I could help bail him out. The bail amount was pretty steep, and she didn't have enough money to cover it. While I do have the funds, I have serious reservations about using my savings to bail out someone who clearly hasn't learned from their past mistakes. Plus, I work hard for my money and have my own financial goals and responsibilities.

I told her that I couldn't help this time, and she was really upset. She argued that family should always come first and that I was being selfish. I tried to explain my reasoning, but she wasn't having it. She ended up borrowing money from her parents to get him out, but now things are tense between us.

I feel bad that she's upset, but I also think it's important to set boundaries, especially when it comes to financial matters.

1g6vjst,AITA for asking my parents to start paying rent if they want to keep living with me?,"I’m (19F) in kind of a weird situation. I recently inherited my late grandmother’s house. It’s not a mansion, but it’s a comfortable home in a decent neighborhood. Here’s the thing: my parents (50s) moved in with me shortly after, saying it was temporary because they were struggling financially after some bad investments.



At first, I was fine with it. I mean, they’re my parents, right? But it’s been over six months now, and they seem really comfortable here—too comfortable. They don’t seem to be looking for new jobs or places to live. I’ve been paying for all the utilities, groceries, and maintenance out of my own money, which I saved up while working part-time and from the small inheritance I received.



They keep making these small comments about how it’s “their home too” since I wouldn’t have the house without them and my grandmother. They even redecorated part of it without asking me! I tried bringing up the issue, suggesting they could contribute financially at least by paying rent or utilities, but they got upset. My mom said, “We’re family, we don’t charge each other,” and my dad said it’s selfish to ask them to pay when they’re struggling. But I’m also struggling with balancing work and school, and it’s not like they’re making an effort to move out or even lighten the financial burden.



I love them, but I feel like they’re taking advantage of the situation. I don’t want to evict my own parents, but this is my space and I feel like I have no control over my own home anymore.

1fzce77,AITA for refusing to apologize for something I never did?,"Using a throwaway account.

I graduated high school 15 years ago. We recently had our 15 year school reunion.

Anyway, during high school, there was this kid named Ivan. I didn't interact much with him, but he hated me. For the life of my I didn't understand why as I hardly ever talked with him. Until one day during our senior I learned that he hated me because he thought I was telling people he was gay. I never did and I asked why he thought I was telling people that.

He refused to elaborate and said someone told him I was telling people he was gay (he wasn't to the best of my knowledge). I told him I""m sorry he thinks that, but I never said that to anyone.

Come our high school reunion and he again confronts me for calling him gay. I once more say I never did. He accuses me of lying and demands I apologize. I refuse and he goes off saying I'm a bullying AH and that he's tired of people assuming he's gay because of me.

I again said I never said that, and to be honest, I don't care if someone is gay or not because I don't have a problem with it. He storms off saying it was a waste of time coming and he wishes he would have known ahead of time that I was there.

Maybe I should have apologized just to give him closure or something. It was probably a little childish, but I've had to apologize before for things I never did and I hated it but I don't know. Should have I apologized? And I don't want to give the impression I think there is anything worng with someone being gay or thinking someone might be gay because there isn't.

1g31bx3,AITA for refusing to pay double my own meal bill at a family event?,"We had a family meal out for my Nan's birthday yesterday. Family included:

Nan
Family A: Two parents with three adult children, ages 18,23,25.
Family B: Two parents with disabled, adult son.
Adult C
Family D: Two parents with two, school-aged children.
Me (30F)
This was arranged by my Family A 25F cousin, with meals pre-ordered from a fixed price menu. I chose a two-course meal plus soft drink. Everybody else (minus young children) had a three-course meal, two alcoholic drinks & a hot drink each.

(For the sake of maths, I've removed the service charge/tips from the bill)

The bill arrived, & I expected to pay for my meal & drink, plus ~£2.00 towards Nan's meal (each of us contributed, so Nan ate for free). My meal was £18.95, plus £2.50 drink, so I was expecting a bill ~£25.00. The three-course meal everybody else had was £22.95, & each person spent a similar figure on alcoholic & hot drinks, plus their own contribution to Nan's meal. My adult (18-25) cousins in Families A & B would be paid for by their parents.

My Family A 25F cousin said each adult owed £50.00, including division of school-aged children's meals amongst everybody. I checked my sums again - my bill was definitely £25.00 - but nobody mentioned that I'd consumed half of what everybody else had because they either wanted a cheaper bill or wanted to go home, so I reminded my cousin of my smaller meal & lack of alcoholic & hot drinks.

I left the room for five minutes, & chaos ensued. Everybody was shouting at everybody, & my Family D brother-in-law started yelling at me whilst my Family A aunt shouted at him 'She's not MY granddaughter, so why do I have to pay for her?!'. People then glared at me or avoided my eyes, & Family B aunt said 'You! Why can't you just muck in like everybody else?!' & when I said I can't afford to pay double what my actual bill was, she said 'Then why didn't you say that at the start? What do we do, not invite you to future events?!' My Family A 23M cousin paid the bill, & later messaged each person with what they owed him.

For reference, we have never split bills 'down the middle'. With different, individual family sizes involved including children with an age range of twenty years, it's not been fair to do so, so historically bills have been paid with each family paying their own way. Now, with the aforementioned children now being adults, this rule has shifted a couple of times to splitting a bill equally amongst all of the adults, with no thought towards anyone (usually me) who consumed less food & no alcohol. I challenged this once before, & my Family A aunt announced 'SHE (me) is paying [£10.00 for jacket potato & Coke], & EVERYBODY ELSE is paying [£35.00 for a two-course meal & two G&Ts]!', making everybody roll their eyes at me for being difficult/different/a tight arse, etc.

1gg06pj,AITA for not making enough dinner?,"My wife had a nail appointment after work, so I picked up the kids from daycare tonight.

When I got home around 5:30pm, my older daughter had already made herself one box of Mac & Cheese. The plan for dinner was Mac & Cheese and hotdogs anyway, so I cooked a package of hotdogs and waited to see if I needed to cook more Mac & Cheese.

All of us ate, and there was half a hotdog and a couple of bites of Mac & Cheese left when we were done.

Before I could clean up my wife called to say she was on her way home. I told her that we just finished eating, and that the food was gone, and asked what she wanted to eat. She said she would cook something for herself when she got home. I asked if she was sure, and she said yes.

When she got home she was very upset with me because I didn't cook enough for everyone. I offered to cook more Mac & cheese and hotdogs, but she said no, and continued telling me that I was socially inept and that I didn't understand and I should have made more food. AITA?

1g3twpx,AITA for declining to be a bridesmaid because of couple’s cultural? ,"I’m (27F) a mixed girl so I don’t understand the whole thing about Indian dowries. My friend from college was getting engaged and told me when she thought it was happening. She said she thought it was happening soon. They had been together for 3 years which was a long time for an engagement and she said relatives were starting to talk and making her feel like her bf was just screwing around with her and not serious about it.

Then she called me several times in a week which was a lot more often and seemed out of it. I asked her what was wrong and she cried on the phone and admitted the reason he had not proposed was because his parents back in India wanted a large dowry and her family in the US was refusing to pay it. She said her family has been in the US for 2 generations and no one has paid a dowry in that time but his parents are old fashioned and think if they don’t receive a dowry it will show there is something wrong with their family. I don’t understand their reasoning but I told her to break up if he won’t fight for them to be together. She said he won’t because he sees it as something to be discussed between their parents. I’m kind of shocked she still wants to marry this guy. His parents are in India, he is a grown ass man and he won’t marry his gf just because they want money. 

At the end of last year her parents agreed to pay a dowry because she begged them. She says it’s much lower than they asked and they are not happy but agreed. 

I got an invite for their wedding for Jan 2025 in California. I called her and told her I couldn’t attend and apologized. She was shocked and said I was one of the few friends she could invite and I said I couldn’t because I don’t think I should go to a wedding if I don’t think she is marrying a good person. She said she disagrees with the dowry practices but it wasn’t for me to judge if demanding it meant someone was a good person. I just said I disagree with the wedding happening because her parents had to effectively bribe someone to have it happen. She got mad and said I should RSVP no and hung up. I feel guilty because she clearly wanted me there but the whole thing is really gross to me. But AITA for judging cultural practices from a culture I’m not a part of?

So today, she bought sushi again, cause I asked her to, since I felt annoyed they left me out last weekend

I always cook Holiday dinners, as my Mother can’t cook. This would have been our 3rd thanksgiving dinner. The issue isn’t her lack of cooking. The issue is that she invites guests without telling me until the last minute. And she doesn’t actually ask, because she will have already invited them and will tell me by posing it as a question. “Oh by the way, I invited your (insert random family member) to come for dinner. Is it ok?” Like lady, you already told them to, so of course if i say no it starts drama. She knows I dislike her family because they are all drama, including her since she entertains it. 

So this year I have decided to not cook Thanksgiving dinner. She asked me the other day what was on the menu for this year and I told her nothing and my reason why. She loudly says wow and then tried to guilt trip me by reminding me this would be our last year living together. She is retiring and bought a house back in her home country. I told her she will live 30 mins away driving distance. So she chill on the dramatics, and also my kids and I will not be made to feel uncomfortable in our own house. She tried to deny we were uncomfortable m, until I reminded her we spend the entire time in my room watching movies, until they all leave.

I was not okay with that and said as much. We didn't get anywhere because he insisted all childcare-related tasks were my responsibility since I had always done them. 

After of mediation, he continued to argue with me and I told him that 50/50 custody means he is 100% responsible during his time with her and I am 100% responsible during my time. His counter-off was still 50/50 custody but she could stay with me most of the summer and he would see her everyother weekend but we still switch weeks during the school year. 

I again refused and told him “50/50 custody means 50/50 all year long not just when it's convenient for you.” That apparently got through to him and he's told me I can have primary physical custody and he will take her every other weekend and we split holidays during the school year when he can take vacation to stay with her instead of working. 

But now he’s told his family about our disagreement and they are texting and calling me because I'm stealing his child from him. They think I should continue to be responsible for all childcare all year long since he works so hard and needs the help. His mother was being particularly vocal about it and I asked her why doesn't she volunteer to pay for childcare for him. Her response was that it's too expensive and not her responsibility. Again I disagreed because im not her son's nanny. I told the rest of his family the same thing.

I was sure I was right until his sister who I've always thought of as level-headed also told me I was being unfair. Ex hasn't ever had to do any of those tasks and he shouldn't be expected to start doing them now after so many years. Am I the asshole for telling him he's reasonable for our daughter during his time with her which is now preventing him from having 50/50 custody?

Editing because I forgot to add: I have been exceptionally careful to keep our daughter out of earshot of any verbal conversations around this and I don't let her play with my phone she won't stumble across any of the text exchanges. She loves us both and I dont want to be one of those parents that involves the child in adult matters. 

Second edit because it was brought to my attention I didn't say why us both scheduling and paying for the childcare time we need is possible. Childcare is through her school all year long. We can each have an account and the days needed are selected and paid for a month in advance. It's not a set schedule until then days are paid for.

1gan8yx,AITA for getting my sister and girlfriend the same birthday present? ,"My girlfriend and sister have birthdays in the same month, so I went shopping for their birthday presents at the same time. 

They both like perfumes and both have similar preferences in perfumes-- sweet, edible, gourmand--and I found a perfume that captured the vibe and did it really well. I knew they'd both like it, so I bought two bottles, and gifted one to each. 

My girlfriend thinks it's weird to give the same perfume to both your sister and your girlfriend. I think that I got a gift that I knew each of them would like and enjoy, and that my thought process was that if they happened to be the same perfume, oh well.

1g5akaw,AITA for refusing to lend my best friend money after she started dating the guy I had a crush on?,"I (24F) have been best friends with “Mia” (24F) for almost 10 years. Recently, I met a guy named Jake (26M) through a mutual friend, and I had a pretty big crush on him. I told Mia everything, from how we met to the fact that we’d been texting a lot. She always seemed supportive, telling me to go for it.



But about a week ago, I found out that Mia had started secretly dating Jake. When I asked her about it, she said she didn’t think it was a big deal because Jake and I were never “official.” That really hurt me, but I didn’t want to lose my best friend, so I tried to let it go.



Now, Mia has asked me to lend her $500 because she’s struggling financially. Normally, I’d help her out, but after what she did, I don’t feel comfortable giving her money. I told her I couldn’t do it, and she got really upset, saying I was being petty and letting my feelings about Jake get in the way of our friendship.



I’m now second-guessing myself because I’ve always been there for her, and she’s called me selfish for not helping when she needs it. AITA for refusing to lend her money after she started dating the guy I liked?

1glbyny,AITA for disinviintg my daughter to Thanksgiving when she won't host Thanksgiving?,"Throwaway 

In our family, holidays are rotated, so one person hosts the Fourth of July, another hosts Christmas, and another hosts Thanksgiving etc.. This way, no one is constantly hosting, and it makes it fair for everyone. This post is about my middle daughter, Clara. Clara has always been skipping her host duties, when it gets to her she has an excuse why she can't host. It ranges but usually goes along the lines of stress or she is too busy. 

This results in other family members to pick up her holiday. It is frustrating and multiple people have talked to her about this. She bailed on hosting Easter but promised me that she would do Thanksgiving we swapped holidays. At the time I made it very clear she needed to stay true to her word and if she dumped it on someone else she wouldn't be going to Thanksgiving. It usually gets dumped on me.

Anyway, I called her asking if she wanted me to bring a dessert board for Thanksgiving. She told me that she could not host because she had just moved into her home (she moved in July), and it was too messy to host. I told her she could clean since it was a few weeks away. She told me she can't. 

I know the other kids can't host it, (well one could but she is doing Christmas and its not fair at all for her). I informed everyone it would beat my place this year. I also informed everyone that Clara is not invited this year to Thanksgiving.

Clara was pissed when I told her that and we got into a huge argument. She thinks I am a big jerk. My other kids are split, two of them are happy since they are tired of picking up her slack when this happens while others things this is too far.

1gtp5c4,AITA for refusing to let my brother bring his girlfriend to Thanksgiving after she disrespected my wife?,"I (31M) am married to Lily (30F). My brother Josh (29M) recently started dating Lindsey (27F), and while she’s been polite at family events, Lily feels Lindsey has made some passive-aggressive comments. For example, at a recent BBQ, Lindsey said it was “selfish” that Lily and I weren’t planning to have kids anytime soon. Lily felt uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything at the time. Another incident happened at a family dinner when Lindsey remarked, “I’m surprised you two are so happy without kids. You must be really good at being selfish.” Lily was hurt by that comment, and it made her feel like Lindsey was judging our life choices. Most recently, at a birthday party, Lindsey made a comment about Lily’s career, saying, “It’s cute that you’re working part-time with no kids while Josh and I are really focusing on our careers.” Lily was annoyed, but didn’t say anything because she didn’t want to start drama. Thanksgiving is at our house this year, and when Josh asked if he could bring Lindsey, I told him I’d prefer if she didn’t come. I explained that some of her comments had made Lily feel disrespected, and I didn’t want that to ruin the holiday. Josh got upset and said I was being petty. He argued that I was overreacting and that Lindsey was “just being honest,” but I stood my ground. Now Josh says he won’t come if Lindsey isn’t invited, and my parents are caught in the middle.

So last night around 8pm Ally comes into my room in tears. I could instantly tell something was off so I asked and she said ""I think I startedy period"". I comforted and told her it was going to be alright and all that jazz.

My mom got home around 10 and I told her what happened and she went crazy. She said I was overstepping and I should've called her and not have told Ally anything but just gave her a pad. She said I was ignoring her feelings and being ignorant. And that it was her job as a mother to explain everything to Ally.

1h1hofm,AITA for allowing my mother to bring Thanksgiving food to my house this year? Married with 3 kids and a pregnant wife,"1 week ago, my mother asked to spend Thanksgiving at our house this year and my brother and niece planned on tagging along. For context, my grandmother passed earlier this year and my family usually got together at her house for Thanksgiving. I told her we initially planned on visiting my in laws because they live closer to us and my wife wasnt enthusiastic about cooking this year, but I'd ask my wife to see if they had any concrete plans locked in. We then decided on staying here and hosting my family. I offered to cook to help out but my wife insisted that she wanted to cook. This was about a week ago.

Fast forward to today. My mother calls me and tells me she planned on bringing stuffing with turkey legs, fresh sweet potatoes, and a cake. My wife goes absolutely ballistic, saying it's extremely rude to bring food to someone's house for Thanksgiving. We get into an argument because I'm trying to say that shes just trying to be nice and help out, but my wife fully believes she is either trying to be rude or disrespectful and how as her husband I shouldnt have allowed it. She begins to talk to her family about how rude my mom is and just overall being angry towards me. To remedy this, I basically had to tell her not to bring any food and only the cake because it's acceptable. I personally didn't think it was such a problem given the situation, but apparently it is.

1gobtc8,AITA for offending my in-laws by deciding my daughters won’t have a Quinceanera and the reasons?,"Context: My husband (m 35) and I (f 34) have two daughters. The oldest Lexie (14) is not my husband's biological child but he has been nothing short of a father to her. Our second daughter Rosie (husbands bio) is just a baby.

Last weekend we got together with hubby’s family at his parent’s house. MIL started talking about how we need to prepare for Lexie’s Quinceanera next year. Hub’s family has joked multiple times about Lexie getting to have a Quince now that she’s an honorary Mexican thru my husband. My husband's family is from Mexico. I am not of Latino origin. They grew up in the Catholic faith. I did not. 

While I love that hubby’s family considers Lexie their own and includes her in other Mexican traditions, Quinceaneras are the one exception. I have told my husband before I don’t agree with what it historically represents and we aren’t Catholic. My husband has also said he understand this.

I tell my MIL that Lexie won’t be having a Quince and has told me she just wants to go do something with her friends. My MIL snapped at my husband in Spanish and left the room. I was then bombarded with both of my SILs, one their husbands, and my MIL from the other room demanding to know why Lexie couldn’t have a Quince. My husband told them to stand down but for the next 20 minutes they kept making passive aggressive comments like “poor Lexie won’t have a Quince like her little sister will.”


I finally said in a stern but calm tone ""I understand it's a tradition. But I do not agree with the original meaning of Quinces in that now a 15 year old is a woman and ready for marriage. I know it's modernized now and means they're just entering womanhood but I still don't agree with the symbolism. They’re kids. Besides *Husband* and I don’t practice Catholic faith. Lexie is not having a quince and I don't want Rosie to have one either.""

From all directions shouts of ""WHAT? Rosie HAS to have one!"" and ""Rosie is Mexican! You can decide for Lexie but not for Rosie!"" came from all my in-laws. All last week my husband was getting texts about how much I offended them and that a Quince (more so for Rosie as his bio kid) is a right of passage and marks a milestone into womanhood. I told my husband that if Rosie really wants one in the future I would be open to hearing her reasonings. But I won’t encourage or force her to. My husband hates confrontation and told me this morning that I'm the jerk for not just giving in because disagreeing with how they feel about Quinces is offensive to them.",Sad-Cell2569,3351,1897,0.8799999952316284,0.4868965429930633,1731275079,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gobtc8/aita_for_offending_my_inlaws_by_deciding_my/,2024,11,AmItheAsshole,2024-11-10 21:44:39
1gmwni8,AITA for telling DIL she married into the wrong family after a comment she made? ,"Im 62F and a busy single mother/grandma. 
3 of my kids live with me ages 22,26, and 32. My grandson(2yo) also lives with me. My oldest son (30) and his wife(28) visited last weekend and my DIL pulled me aside and made a comment that she’s “worried” about my kids and I because “things don’t seem to be changing” as far as my other kids moving out, or getting a higher education/careers. Also when i asked why they’ve been lessening visits, she answered “where will we sleep? the couch?” 
My DIL has been around for 8 years and we’ve always had a good relationship, but her question and comment came off very judgmental. I get it, she’s a nurse. She also encouraged my son to go to IT school, while the rest of my kids and I all live at home working normal jobs staying a float. I guess the fact that my adult kids have never moved out “concerns” her and my son mentioned she’s been feeling these things ever since they’ve started trying for a baby. I don’t understand that. 

To her comment, I told her “maybe you married into the wrong family then” and continued my night. My son told me I really hurt her feelings, but she also really hurt mine.

1gw1stq,AITA for expecting not to have to pay for Thanksgiving groceries?,"I have never posted here before, so my apologies if I make any mistakes. 

I (54f) have been invited by a friend (50f) who I will call Ann, to come to her house for Thanksgiving.  

We all live in Italy, but spent many years in the USA, and have several American friends in the area.  

Ann heard that I make a traditional Thanksgiving dinner at my house every year for my family and a couple friends (6 people total).  

It is quite difficult to get all of the supplies here (no buying canned pumpkin, or cranberry sauce!), so I make every single thing from scratch.  Over the years, I’ve also acquired all the dishes and tools and spices - know suppliers for the more exotic things, and am an all around good cook. 

So Ann, who was born in China but lived in the USA for 20+ years, asked if I would come to her beautiful (and much bigger) home, and “teach her” how to make the whole dinner.  

For a group of 12 people instead of the usual 6.  

I was hesitant at first, because we live a very modest lifestyle, and Ann and her (British) husband are very well off, but I figured it would still be fun, and I would enjoy putting on the feast for new people and in a beautiful kitchen. 

After I agreed, the problems began.  First, Ann wanted to have the dinner on a day that isn’t Thanksgiving, to make it more convenient.  I decided it wasn’t all that important, since we live in Italy.  So it is scheduled for the Sunday prior to the actual day. 

Then when we were planning to meet to go shopping for all the ingredients, she asked if I could do all the shopping and she would “reimburse me for her half”. 

I asked what she meant, and she said that I’d be paying for half of everything. 

So not only would I be doing all the shopping, all the planning, all the cooking and teaching her as well, but now I’m expected to pay for the food? 

I told her I could not do this (we really don’t have the budget!) so now she’s trying to alter the menu she agreed to (turkey & fixings, candied yams, roasted veggies, an appetizer, and pie).  Really a modest dinner by American standards. 

She then made a comment that “her” friends don’t “eat like pigs”.

She then went to another guest *with my recipes* and asked her to prepare my pumpkin pie so she didn’t have to buy the ingredients. 

Bear in mind, Ann and her husband are very wealthy.  I’d estimate the whole dinner for 12 might cost €200 for the ingredients, and my labor Ann gets for free. 

She thinks I’m being “stubborn and ungenerous” (ie an AH) 

My family thinks Ann is  taking advantage of my kindness and her miserly ways are ridiculous, since she’d spend double that amount for lunch out on a whim. 

So AITA for refusing to “contribute” to the meal or be bullied into this nonsense?  My family wants me to just bow out and tell her I’m not comfortable with her attitude.  I’m tempted, because this feels toxic and manipulative.

1gsyytu,AITA for refusing to force my daughter to shave for a wedding? And backing out of paying for it when we were uninvited?,"I honestly can’t believe this situation has come to this, and I really need some outsider perspective. 
I’m a 35yr old man, and I was two beautiful daughters, Lucy (7) and Molly (16). I adopted them both and have raised them by myself for their entire lives. I also have a sister, Julie (33F) who is getting married in two months to Paul (35M). 
Both Julie and Paul are lower middle class and have been saving for years for their very expensive dream wedding. Even with all the prep, they’re about $14,000 short.
I own a law firm and am doing quite well, so I offered to help cover the remaining cost. 
The trouble arose last week when Julie and I took Molly and Lucy dress shopping. She picked out a short sleeved, just above the knee dress for Molly. It looked beautiful on her, and everything was fine until Julie said that Molly would have to shave. 
Molly is autistic and generally has Low Support Needs, but sensory issues are a big one for her. She doesn’t shave any body hair at all because the of the feeling (which is 100% okay in my book, her body her choice). So when Julie said this, I told her no, that Molly would not do that and she could either pick a longer dress or let her be. Julie got heated and we left without purchasing anything. 
The next day, Julie asked if I had thought about how foolish I was being and Molly needed to learn to suck it up, that nobody wanted to see that blah blah blah. Things escalated again, and she ended up uninviting us. I told her that was fine, it was her wedding.
I hadn’t heard from her until today, when she called to ask me when they could discuss what I would be paying for and when. I asked if she was joking, and told her because she uninvited us, I wouldn’t be paying a cent. She  started to freak out, first getting angry and then began to cry over the phone. I hung up on her. 
She apparently called our mom, aunts, and grandparents and told them I was ruining her wedding. Now I’m getting calls about how cruel and heartless I am, and that I’m not entitled to have my kids at the wedding. Especially from my mom, who reminded me that this Julie’s big day and she’s been dreaming about it since she was little. Some people think I should just pay even if we can’t go, while others say that Molly needs to grow up and get over it. I think someone who can’t accept my daughter doesn’t deserve my money.

1gzwdpg,"AITA for ruining my brother’s childhood memory by admitting I photoshopped it 14 years ago?
","When my younger brother (20 now) was 6, he went through a huge Harry Potter phase. He loved the wizarding world and believed he might meet ‘Harry Potter’ (Daniel Radcliffe) or the other characters on a family trip to Scotland since Hogwarts was ‘there.’ No one promised him this, but he convinced himself it could happen. Sadly, the trip was canceled after our grandpa passed away, and my brother was devastated for both reasons.

To cheer him up, I decided to craft a 'souvenir'. I was 16 and had just discovered photoshop, so I edited a picture of my brother with Daniel Radcliffe to make it look like they'd met. I printed it, framed it, and gave it to him without telling him it was fake. He loved it and fully believed he’d met Daniel. Soon, he had an entire story about the meeting; what they talked about, how Daniel hugged him, etc. It was so sweet, and none of us (my family and I) had the heart to tell him the truth.

Fast forward 14 years, and my brother still didn’t know that the old, low quality picture of him meeting Daniel Radcliffe is fake. I never told him because his memory of the fake meeting felt so real to him that it became one of his proudest stories. Over time the memory became less important and the framed picture had been packed away in some box, and my brother has long outgrown his Harry Potter obsession. Yesterday, however, we were at our parents' home and we were bringing up old memories, you know how it goes. The story of meeting Daniel Radcliffe came up, and thinking it was harmless, I told him the truth. I thought he’d laugh but instead he got visibly upset. He didn’t want to believe me at first, thinking I was messing with him. I told him the real story of how and why I did it. He told me that it feels like I robbed him of a real childhood memory that he really cherished, and he feels embarrassed thinking about all the times he's told people about meeting Daniel Radcliffe in person, even recently. We ended our conversation on a semi-good note, though. I apologised for not telling him sooner, because I do feel bad that it meant so much to him even now. But I don’t regret it. Back then, it made him so happy during a rough time, and I don’t regret giving him that joy. I just didn't realize how much it still meant to him. So I'm just wondering, am (or was) I the a-hole?

As we approached we noticed there were probably a dozen kids there and 2 large labs running in the grassy area unleashed.  My wife and I are like the dogs shouldn't be there unleashed but our little guy was excited to be at the playground.  So we continued.  We let our boy run around and the younger one we put in the swing.  Some parents that were there started talking to us.  They are essentially one big neighborhood parent group and meet up weekly.  I didn't know anyone in this group.  

My son climbed a structure and went down a slide.  Once he was off the slide there were no kids on that structure.  A lady that had the 2 dogs there (I still don't know if she was a parent), let the dogs onto the playground structure and let them go down the slide. 

I spoke up to this lady and told her to keep her dogs off the equipment.  She told me they were her service dogs.  I said, i don't think service dogs play on playground equipment.  She snaps back to me service dogs are allowed to take breaks. She continues saying that we are here every week and no one has ever complained.  I say that not everyone is comfortable around dogs and tell her I think its selfish to let your dogs on the equipment especially when children are around.   

Some parents support her and said as much to my wife and I.    She told me that I should make sure my kids are comfortable around dogs before bringing them around dogs.   I told this lady that she was insane and completely missed my point.  My wife and I left after this.  We noticed a facebook post about us (that we have not engaged) and it seems its 50/50 on if we are the assholes.  ",Elegant-Climate-6953,2974,1232,0.8799999952316284,0.3456423387162978,1730758292,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gjquni/aita_for_telling_a_wheelchair_bound_lady_her/,2024,11,AmItheAsshole,2024-11-04 22:11:32
1glcer9,AITA for not waking up my roommate on the day of his final med school exam?,"
I (23M) and my roommate Justin (23M) are med students. We've been living together as roommates for two years, and  we live in a hostel. 

Last week were our final year exams, and it was absolute hell. We were surviving on 2-3 hours of sleep daily, fueled by coffee and energy drinks (I know it’s not healthy but there’s no other way to pass lol). 

On the last day of exams, Justin was unusually exhausted. Around 1 am, he decided to sleep and told me to wake him up at 3 am. I agreed.

However, by 2:30 am, I was dead. My brain was shutting down, my notes were getting blurry and I knew if I stayed up any longer, I'd pass out. I decided to wake Justin up early.

I woke Justin up at 2:30 am and told him the time and suggested he set an alarm so he wouldn't oversleep. Justin sat upright, rubbed his eyes, and nodded and said ‘alright’. 

I was like ‘don’t forget to set the alarm’ and then almost instantly fell asleep.

We both woke up at 8 AM. (I had set my alarm for 6 but I kept hitting snooze). Justin freaked out, accusing me of not waking him up as promised. 

I reminded him that I did wake him up at 2:30 AM and suggested he set an alarm. Justin said that he was too sleepy to comprehend what’s happening and insisted that I should have stayed awake to wake him at 3 AM or at least made sure he was fully awake before sleeping. 

Justin's exam didn't go well, and now he's blaming me.

I understand his frustration, but I think he's being unfair.

1goe8uc,WIBTA if I told my wife she can’t take our 3 month old daughter to Australia on holiday without me? ,"So my wife and I just welcomed our first born to the world - the last 6 weeks with her have been absolutely incredible! We both love her to bits, it’s been an intense learning curve but every day there’s something new to marvel at with her. 

There is something hanging over us both right now though…she mentioned to me in passing about 6 months ago that she’d like to travel to Australia with the baby to visit her family for a couple of weeks during maternity leave. We never really discussed it in depth at the time, I think I said something along the lines of ‘Okay cool let’s maybe wait until the babies here safely’ type thing. My wife didn’t really push the point and I didn’t really think much of it. 

Fast forward to a week ago and we’re sat at a dinner table with my wife’s family (and our month old daughter :) ) and they start talking about specific flights and plans they’re making. Australia hasn’t been mentioned to me for 6 months. I had no idea that it was going ahead and it turns out the trip is only a matter of weeks away (9). All I could feel was sheer panic and I realised I really don’t want to spend that long not seeing my amazing new little baby (and my wife too!). 

After dinner I told my wife how I felt. I knew that she’d mentioned it before but hearing the detailed plans had me panicking as it was becoming a reality. I really don’t want her to go to the other side of the world (we live in London) with our newborn without me. I don’t think she’s fully considered how difficult and stressful flying solo long haul with a baby and 3 weeks worth of luggage would be. But, from my perspective I don’t want my daughter to be that far away from me for that long at such an early age. I’m just getting used to being a Dad and all I want to do with every moment of my spare time right now is spend it with my new family. During three weeks I could miss some amazing first moments, but also should anything happen I’d be absolutely helpless 10,000 miles away. 

Me travelling for 3 weeks on this short notice is out of the question, I can’t get that time off work. Does it make me an asshole for not wanting them to go? 

We’ve still not had a proper conversation about it yet and she wants to fly out first week of Jan. It’s tough because I know she wants her family to meet our daughter and she wants to go while she has time off on Maternity - but it just seems way too soon.

1gl98v5,AITA For Telling My BIL that If His Wife Will Not Want to Have a Relationship With Me then I Will not Have My Children to Have a Relationship with Her.,"Background where everybody is coming from.

I am married to my BIL’s brother. My BIL’s wife went NC with the family a couple years ago. We did not realize it until my other SIL found out that she had her blocked on social media. That’s when everything unfolded that she had done it to all of us. She also blocked our phone numbers. When we asked my BIL about it, my BIL said there were too many dramas going on in the family that SIL does not want to be part of or involved with and that we are toxic, we are too much for her and that SIL is too busy to spend her free time being around our “energy”. 

SIL also did not appreciate the family jokes, BIL did not give an example but what stuck with me was my MIL told my BIL at their housewarming party when his friend arrived “why my BIL did not marry his best friend instead of his wife?” in front of my SIL, which she was only joking because the friend arrived in a nice car. I also did not like the joke, but my SIL did not say anything.

I admit that some members of our family would stir up drama here and there but at the end of the day we are still family. We do not see eye to eye, but we are still family.

So, this happened last weekend. One of my husband’s cousins got married where my BIL and his wife were in attendance. My BIL sent a group text that his wife will be there in support of their cousin and his wife (SIL is a good friend of the bride). BIL said that SIL would not want to discuss the issues, that it was not our day, and asked to give SIL the space.

The entire wedding she talked and laughed with the extended family and friend, she played with my children and my other SIL’s children but ignored us. She did not even look at us nor acknowledged us. She even turned her back on my husband when he tried to approach her. We are all hurt from her actions because to this date we do not know what we did that was so bad that we deserve the treatment.

So, I finally had it and told my BIL that if his wife would not want to have a relationship with us, then she is not allowed to have a relationship with my children.

I heard on the background her saying, “that’s low and manipulative but she is the parent so, okay. Don’t worry “name of their child” can still have a relationship with them if they want to. Your family is exhausting, please deal with it”

My BIL told me I am manipulative for pulling this BS but respect my decision then hang up. I tried texting him my reasons, but he was not responding.

1h2yif9,AITA for yelling at a lady on her phone before Wicked?,"Just left the movie and I'm curious. 

The first video saying turn off your phone goes and she's scrolling on Facebook with her brightness up. The second video saying to get off your phone goes and she's still on it, so I yell down (it's stadium seating) like 3 rows for her to turn it off. She did the rest of the show too! 

After the movie, a lady says I have an ugly voice and I joke that I love compliments on my voice. And I loudly say to my friend if I wonder if that's the lady I yelled at after she wouldn't listen to Jeff Goldblum to turn off her phone. And I say stay mad when she and her husband were shaking their heads in disgust. 

So AITAH?

Edit: The lady stayed off her phone. My friend joked I scared everyone straight, lol.

Edit 2: Wow, this blew up! Here are some answers to a few questions that are popping up 

1. This was well past when the trailers were done and was obviously right before the movie started. Literally, the movie started almost immediately after.

2. No, I wasn't singing or doing anything that made me a bad audience member. My voice is just Miley Cyrus level loud and raspy, and the lady recognized my voice while walking out.

1gw0he1,AITA for being ungrateful and not eating the brownies my gf made for me? ,"
Yesterday my gf surprised me with some homemade brownies. She baked them specifically for me, she was so thoughtful and used all vegan ingredients. It made me feel both so valued and cared for but also stressed because I knew I wouldn't like them, because I can not handle the chewy texture of them. But she didn't know that. I love the chocolate flavor so she must have thought i would ike brownies too. 

I thanked and then told her I'm really not good with chewy textures. She insisted that I take a bike so I did. I could barely swallow it. smiled and hid my disgust the best I could because I knew she would be offended. 

I must suck at faking my reaction because she immediately asked me does it really taste that horrible? I said it no it's not about that, I just can't handle the chewy textures. I told her it has nothing to with the taste or her baking and not to take it personal. 

Unfortunately she did. She told me I'm ungrateful and I could just take few bites and tell her I will save the rest for the later like a normal person. 

I apologized and said I don't think I will be able to take more bites. That really upset her. She said fine I will fucking throw them away then and throw them into garbage. She was so upset the whole time and decided to not stay over so I gave a ride . She was upset during the ride too and slammed the door when she was leaving. 

I don’t know how to feel all about this. AITA?",peterlikeschicken,3513,704,0.9100000262260436,0.2644165494881253,1732139670,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gw0he1/aita_for_being_ungrateful_and_not_eating_the/,2024,11,AmItheAsshole,2024-11-20 21:54:30

1gw0pcq,AITA for Kicking My Boyfriend Out because he Didn’t Take Me to My Oral Surgery?,"
I recently had oral surgery to get my wisdom teeth removed, and I needed a designated driver. I asked my boyfriend if he could take me, and he said he’d find out if he could. Over the past few days, he seemed excited about the idea, even joking about wanting to see how I’d act under anesthesia.

Fast forward to this morning, the day of my surgery. I asked him if he was still going to take me, and he said no. He told me he needed to get a haircut for a presentation he has tomorrow, as the rubric says he should be “well-groomed.” For context, I think his hair already looks fine, but he said he doesn’t like it.

Luckily, I had a backup plan and asked another friend to take me, but I was still really upset. I told him that I wanted him there and was hurt that he backed out at the last minute. He told me it wasn’t his obligation to take me and pointed out that I had other people who could step in, so I shouldn’t be mad.

I feel conflicted. I get that it’s not technically his “obligation,” but I also feel like, as my boyfriend, he should want to prioritize something as important as a medical procedure over a haircut. At the same time, I understand his perspective that he needs to feel confident and professional for his presentation.

We were talking about it when I was dropping him off to classes, and he said I was being dramatic so I kicked him out of my car.

1gwqvh6,AITA - For admitting to my husband that I'm uncomfortable with certain children in our home?,"Hello, 31f married to my husband, 35m. Together 10.5 years. We have no kids and live in our house with our elderly dog. We are both from a small city, and a few years ago decided to move to a bigger city nearby.

In recent years, close friends and family have started families and ask to come stay with us when in big city, with their small kids.

Our house isn't really kid-friendly, I child-proof best I can to make it safe for guests. I prepare toys, snacks, Disney+, make it a friendly place. I generally enjoy spending time with the kids in my life. 

My husband's sister's youngest son (5) has severe behavioral issues. He's been kicked out of 3 daycares and has diagnosed with ODD and ADHD. My SIL comes over for days-long visits with her 3 kids, and he is a huge challenge. He knocks furniture over, throw things around, he's broken several of my items. He snoops in every single room, constantly. Opens every drawer and cupboard to pull things out. SIL ignores it, I'm the one chasing him around trying to stop him. I am so uncomfortable having my personal spaces invaded.

I once found him snooping in our bedroom. He grabbed something very inappropriate from a drawer and was about to run into the main room with it when I grabbed it.

I'm the only adult trying to stop him. Husband and SIL do and say nothing. I tried setting boundaries of rooms that are off limits with my most personal items, but they were ignored. 

As well, my husband's best friends have a 4 year old boy who is very disrespectful in our house. He insults us, screams at my dog, snoops around, wipes his nose on couch pillows and his parents don't do a thing. I don't expect perfect behavior, I just want decent manners and respect in my home.

Now, whenever these specific people ask to come stay with us, I'm filled with anxiety and dread.

During SIL's most recent visit, my husband allowed nephew into an off-limits room and he broke a little Lego item my friends' kid made me. Afterwards I told him how I felt about it and that I was struggling with my discomfort.

He was offended. ""Every time kids come over, you have a complaint/ kids will be kids / you need to lighten up."" Said I'm overreacting about the Lego and it wasn't a big deal. I said the point is that a boundary of mine had been ignored and an item was broken, again.

I explained I have no problems with kids if they can behave. I mentioned the incident of nephew handling a bedroom item. My husband said that I shouldn't let it bother me, and to try to find it funny instead.

I know a big part of his defensive reaction is because SIL's family is the only real family he has. I understand that he's trying to just have a good time with them in his home without negativity.

I want to mention I've always conveyed my concerns to him in a respectful and mature way. I still wonder, if I'm actually TA here and maybe I'm being too negative when my husband is just trying to enjoy time with what little family he has left.",thunderstormthursday,3358,565,0.9800000190734864,0.2320801043708766,1732224576,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gwqvh6/aita_for_admitting_to_my_husband_that_im/,2024,11,AmItheAsshole,2024-11-21 21:29:36
1h1i4x2,AITA for telling my Parter I will no longer help her watch the kids while she works from home. (stay at home dad),"I (M30s) have been a stay-at-home dad for three and a half years. We have two young children—18 months and 3.5 years old. This all started when I moved across the country for a job that simply didn't exist at her uncle's snack company, despite her and her mother swearing up and down it did (and her actually getting her job there). To take this ""fake"" job, I had to quit my job in Minnesota, which meant that when COVID hit shortly after, I didn't qualify for any unemployment benefits or assistance. I burned through my savings. Since she still had a job, we decided I'd stay home with the kids to avoid expensive CA childcare costs.

Here's the problem: she works from home in our 1300 sq ft house with paper-thin walls. She takes meetings all day in the next room, which means I have to keep the kids quiet for most of the day. It's incredibly stressful and makes it almost impossible to do anything with them.

When we made this arrangement, she promised to find a separate workspace outside the house—a she-shed, a converted garage, anything!—but four years later, that still hasn't happened. To make matters worse, she controls all the finances, refuses to fix up the house (even issues that affect the kids!), and has never included me in financial decisions or given me any kind of allowance. She makes a good salary, but she's a terrible spender. Every year, she blows through our savings, and we end up having to ""catch up"" financially, which means there's never any money for family activities, home improvements, or anything else. I feel like I have no say in how our money is spent, even though I'm the one sacrificing my career and income for our family.

I need surgery on my ankle so I can walk properly again, but it requires a 3-6 month recovery period. My wife refuses to even discuss having a family member come help with the kids so I can get this done. I've applied for disability twice, and even though all the doctors agree (even the ones they hired) say I need it, I've been denied.

I love my kids more than anything, but I'm starting to feel like I have no control over my own life or them. I've tried to find a non-standing work-from-home job, but they're all 9-5, which defeats the purpose of me being home with the kids.

1h26mk2,AITA for kicking my niece out of my apartment when she needed my help?,"My wife (26F) and I (27M) live a relatively quiet life. My sister has two kids, one of which being my niece (15F), whom we'll call J. As her younger brother, I know very well that living with my sister sucks, so I have sympathy for my niece, who gets into arguments with her mom. Now J isn't exactly an angel either, the whole family knows that. Well this year, J asked me personally if she could stay with me in my apartment for the summer break, because she and her mom got into a particularly nasty argument, and she wanted ""help and guidance"". I hesitantly agreed, and said she could stay for two months.

Unfortunately, there are a lot issues with J.
1. She is a pathological liar. 50% of everything she says is untrue, and she will lie to your face even if you know the truth. 
2. I have a cabinet full of alcohol that we save for family gatherings and date nights. We don't drink otherwise. I hid the alcohol from J. She found it, and within 3 days, drank EVERYTHING. When I looked into the hiding place all the bottles were empty. 
3. I placed security cameras in the house because of her, and caught her on tape stealing money from my wallet
4. She broke a few of our things out of anger, and when we asked her about it, she said it was an ""accident"" (it was on camera).
5. I tried multiple times to spend time with her and connect with her but she never showed me any respect or seriousness. Everything is a joke.
6. The straw that broke the camel's back is when I confronted her about the alcohol and money she stole, she not only didn't apologize, but lied saying that my wife did all those things and is trying to frame her because she hates her. Even after telling her I have footage of her doing it, she still kept saying she didn't do it and ""I'm conspiring against her"".

I lost my marbles. It has only been five weeks, but I was done. I called my sister and told her J is coming in the morning. J begged me not to send her back. I asked her ""why not stay with your aunt or your father?"", to which she said neither will let her stay with them because they are ""conspiring against her too"". Surprise, she had stolen from them and lied to them too, so no one wants anything to do with her. I didn't care, and drove her back home to her mom, and informed my sister of what J has done. She was furious with J, so I left immediately.

I will never allow them into my house again. I feel a bit bad, because again, her mom is always angry, and her family wants nothing to do with her. It also probably didn't help I told her mom. But still, these are the consequences of her own actions. What do you think? Am I the asshole?

1gpyy2x,AITA for shaming a male coworker about menstruation?,"I (34M) got into a heated argument at work with my coworker (31M). For background, he's the ""I tell it like it is"" type who uses that as an excuse to be insensitive, and frankly, bully others into getting what he wants. Dude has anger issues, and has often talked about possibly fighting people. My own toxic trait is that I'm a people pleaser, so I almost never challenge things he says.

Yesterday another coworker (27F) called out because she's having a particularly difficult menstrual period with severe cramps. When I visited her before work to take supplies, she was really pale and could barely stand up. Our boss was understanding, and national law provides menstrual leave in our country.

At work, the male coworker said having a period isn't being sick and not an excuse to miss work. Perhaps it's because I'm close to the other coworker, and perhaps it's because I'm sick of his attitude, but I told him calmly he doesn't have a uterus, so don't talk about whether having a period is being sick. He said, ""Don't fucking tell me not to talk!"" and I matched his energy and said, ""I'll tell anyone not to say misogynistic shit around me!"" and then he backed down quietly saying it wasn't misogyny. Didn't talk to me or even look in my direction for the rest of the day.

I do feel like I could've worded things better in the moment, but I stand by what I said in general: if you don't have a uterus or menstruate, you don't have any grounds to talk about it (myself included). Also while I don't think he's a full blown misogynist, I do think it's a textbook microaggression to ignore what billions of women throughout history have been saying, thinking you know better.

1h1gsay,AITA for giving my daughter 3 Fritos?,"I (35F) and my husband (44M) recently had our first and only child together. Our daughter is 17 months old. 


After having her, a constant source of conflict is her food. Our daughter started solid foods at 5 months. She started with rice cereal mixed with breast milk. We started to introduce purees after that. My husband wanted her to only have vegetable purees and he told me was giving her too much fruit.

So, eventually, I was able to convince him that she could have both fruit and vegetable purees. Then I had to convince him to let her eat bread. The one and only approved bread was Ezekiel bread, which was because it is a source of complete protein. 

She is not allowed any added sugar. On the surface, this is something I would agree to. I don't think she needs to be eating candy. But my husband means this extremely literally. So, for example, my daughter cannot have Cheerios because they have added sugar. Even the very low sugar version at Trader Joe's, with <1g of added sugar, was vetoed. Another example is that I was giving her baby yogurt, from the baby food aisle, and had to stop because it had added sugar. 

And I get it, to a point, added sugar is insidious here in the United States and in so many foods it shouldn't be, but at the same time, I have sent him multiple articles about how restricting foods usually creates unhealthy relationships with food, and it is better to teach how to enjoy treats in moderation. 

So, this culminated into the event last night that is inspiring the title of my post: I was eating Fritos, and let my daughter have a taste. She had already had her dinner. She had, probably, 3 Fritos. (And she shared them with the dog.) My husband came in and I earned the Dirty Judgemental Look. I was supposed to know Fritos are not allowed. As I usually do when I have learned of a not-allowed food, I asked, why not? Why is it not allowed? 

He INSISTS he is not worried about her weight. He says, ""It is bad for you."" I asked why, and he mouthed at me, ""Are you a r*tard?"" 

I reiterated my previous points that teaching moderation is healthier and I don't want my daughter to have a bad self-image because her dad is obsessed with what she eats.
He countered, ""That is like giving her cigarettes and telling her to smoke in moderation."" Which... it isn't. A Frito is not even remotely close to a cigarette. But in his mind, all ""bad for you"" things are the same and should be 100% avoided.

He says he shouldn't have to tell me which foods are forbidden, that I should just know. I can't possibly know, because they are ridiculous and on top of that, inconsistent. He says he feels like I am doing things behind his back. I say I am teaching my daughter to have a healthy relationship with food. He also doesn't eat this way himself, and never has. We were married 9 years before we had a child.

So, AITA for letting my 17-month-old daughter taste a Frito?",tabiloveskuma,1131,845,0.9200000166893004,0.2035404757180789,1732746402,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h1gsay/aita_for_giving_my_daughter_3_fritos/,2024,11,AmItheAsshole,2024-11-27 22:26:42
1gxlf4r,WIBTA if I tell my husbands ex she has to move out?,"I (35F) have been married to my husband (37M) for 1 year but we've been together for 3. He has 2 children (6F) (8M) from his previous relationship. (We do not have any kids together.) Their mom Anne (34F) has one other child (4F). They have a good co-parenting relationship and Anne and I get along. The Last week when Anne picked up the kids (we have week on week off) she told us that the kids might need to spend a few weeks with us because her and her current husband are getting a divorce. The house is in his name (he had it when they got together) and she's been a stay at home mom for their whole relationship. She said she was going to stay with her sister but they don't have enough room for all 3 kids.

I jumped in before my husband could say anything and offered her the guest room and told her the girls can share a room here just like they do at her house. That way she didn't have to miss her time with the kids and we could help with her daughter while she gets a job and gets things figured out. She thanked us and said she'd let us know when she would be moving out as soon as she could.

My husband asked me if was 100% okay with it, and that it would be fair to get her in here and then have an issue later. I told him I was okay and we'd work through anything that comes up.

That was 3 months ago, she's lived with us for 2 months now and everything is great. It's actually better than great if I'm being honest. Having her here means I don't have to take both kids to the store if I need something for dinner. Housework is divided between 3 people. She's gotten a job and isn't having to pay for childcare (which is about $700 a week in our area) Even though I told her she didn't have to she is giving us $500 a month for bills.

I was talking to my sister and cousin at our early thanksgiving and my sister said I'm crazy for letting her stay with us. That I'm ""devaluing myself as a partner"" and ""being an asshole to myself"" for allowing this to continue. My cousin agrees with her. She said the only reason his ex would agree to stay is if she still wanted to sleep with him and him agreeing means he wants it too.

I don't see them behaving any differently than before, and I truly trust my husband. But now I'm starting to doubt my decision. WIBTA if I tell her she needs to find somewhere else to live? AITA to myself if I don't listen to them and let her stay?

Update:

Thank you all for your comments. You're right, this isn't the first time I've let my older sister's comments get into my head. I sent her a text and told her that my household isn't her concern and if she doesn't trust the man in her life she should focus on her own. Thanks for the reality check. Anne is dying over the number of sister wives comments.

1gvzlak,WIBTA If I refused to watch my brother's baby while he and his wife go off and do MDMA all day,"My brother and his wife live out of town and are coming for a visit over the Thanksgiving holidays. They have asked my mom and I to reserve a day to spend 8 hours (possibly more) watching their 1 year old baby, my niece. Meanwhile, they want to go off and do MDMA together all day. I love my niece and she's an easy baby, but I also don't know much about taking care of a baby, and my aging mother hasn't doesn't it in over 30 years, especially for this long. They have left us with their baby for 4 hours before while they went to a movie when they visited last time (baby was 6 months old). We played with her, fed her, put her down for a nap.

So, part of me is thinking, “okay maybe it's not that hard to take care of the baby for a few hours.” But I really don't want to for that long, especially so they can go off and do drugs. It's not like an emergency and they needed me. On the other hand, I get that it's their ""date day,” and they don't often get to be alone just the two of them anymore, and she just finished breastfeeding last month, thus she is more free now with what she puts in her body.

I'm also concerned that my mother and I will have questions and they will be unreachable for so long. It's not my obligation to watch their kid! That's the bottom line I'm trying to tell myself. But I still feel like an a-hole for wanting to say no to this.


TLDR: my brother and his wife want to leave for a day to have a date day to do MDMA. Am I the a-hole if I prevent them from going on their date day because I don't want to watch their baby for 8 hours?

1h0p9qy,AITA for not keeping up the family tradition? ,"My (25M) wife (24F) gave birth to our son two weeks ago. My family has had the tradition of naming the child months of the year for 5 generations on my mum's side. My name is December (I’ve shortened it to Dec hoping people will think it’s short for Declan or something normal), my brothers are called August (not so common in the UK) and July (poor guy, nothing you can do about that one) and my sisters are called April, June and May (not so bad). 

My wife and I called our son Tobias. We kept the name a secret until after he was born and we had signed the birth certificate so it couldn’t be changed. When we told my parents a week ago, they were most certainly not happy. Even though my dad has the nice normal name of Alex, he liked the tradition. My sister, June, named her daughter March to keep with the tradition so my parents expected me to do the same. My mum continually said that we should call the baby September for a girl and October for a boy throughout the pregnancy. I never outright said I wasn’t going to because I know what lengths they would go to to make sure my baby would have a month as a name. My brothers were on board when we told them, understanding growing up with the teasing. My parents left after saying we were disrespecting my heritage by not following the tradition. I told them I wasn’t going to name my child a ridiculous name because some old, long dead, crazy man decided months of the year would be good names and just because my mum was stupid enough to join him and his madness, didn’t mean I had to. They stormed out and haven’t spoken to me since. 

My sisters have said I should have just named him a month to keep the peace and I’m an asshole for insulting my mum and her family. I feel as though I’m just looking out for what’s best for my son. My family seems to think my wife has “brainwashed” me into calling him something normal even though I have never made it a secret that I hate my name. 

So am I the asshole? ",User593768,1936,556,0.959999978542328,0.1778959169701383,1732661410,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h0p9qy/aita_for_not_keeping_up_the_family_tradition/,2024,11,AmItheAsshole,2024-11-26 22:50:10
1gkkfvc,AITA for my girlfriend not getting into the school she wanted?,"My girlfriend is a non-traditional college student. She completed her associate's last spring with a very high GPA and meant to apply to some prestigious schools. Whenever she started working on her applications, though, she would panic and shut down. She ended up missing all of her deadlines; she did complete her application for one Ivy League school, but didn't submit it at the last moment, saying it was embarrassing and that she had no place there.

I didn't know what to do in these moments, to be honest, but I am sure what I did wasn't right. She would really shut down and pull into herself, going into a thousand yard stare or breaking down in tears. I tried consoling her, but I can't remember a time it worked. I read over her application essays and made suggestions, but she would get defensive and reject them. I'm a pretty bad writer and she's a very good one, so that was likely the right call.

Now she's at a local public university and in tears every day because she finds it isn't the right fit. She blames me and tells me I didn't help enough, that she never felt supported through the process. I asked how I could have helped, and she called me an asshole, saying she didn't know ""how to explain how to help people."" She says she doesn't know if she can forgive me for this.

I am willing to accept I'm the asshole and I'm what's holding her back, but I legitimately don't know what I should have done. How does one help an adult shutting down? What was I supposed to do in this situation? I honestly feel terrible, and having no idea what my proper role should have been just makes it worse.",ThrowRA_pangolin129,1727,578,0.949999988079071,0.1743983921952097,1730848923,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gkkfvc/aita_for_my_girlfriend_not_getting_into_the/,2024,11,AmItheAsshole,2024-11-05 23:22:03
1gvaubn,AITA for not canceling a non-refundable trip for Thanksgiving,"My in-laws always do Thanksgiving the Saturday after. My husband (28M) and I (26F) bought tickets to a dinner theater over a year ago that are non-refundable (almost $200) When we purchased them, we didn’t realize it was the Saturday after until about 2 weeks later. I immediately texted my MIL letting her know that if they did it the Saturday after this year (2024) we wouldn’t be able to make it. (Texted her 11/10/2023) We invited them to our house for actual Thanksgiving day as my husband and I (and kids) stay home on actual holidays. They of course complained and my FIL told my husband that he knew they did Thanksgiving the Saturday after and that it seems we are just waiting for a funeral. (We have a medically complex son, they live an hour away and it’s hard to travel with him) AITA for not eating the cost of those tickets because they decided to still stay on the weekend after even after we told them over a year ago that we wouldn’t be able to go? 

Update: I am not at all upset that they DIDN’T change the day, ultimately it is up to them on when they want to host it. Personally I just think it’s not exactly fair for them to expect us to change our plans that we made over a year ago and informed them of the date. 

2nd update: please see some of my comments there is a character limit on this portion. I should have checked the date and I admit that, we haven’t had a date in almost three years and just got excited and I didn’t think to check when Thanksgiving was. They also don’t care to see or talk to us the rest of the year, it only becomes a problem on holidays. 

3rd edit : Funeral comment was made because we aren’t able to see them that often due to our sons needs and the travel with our son, that we are basically just waiting for one of them to die. (He was drunk when he sent it… so that’s was our interpretation of it) 

4th edit : gotta make this one short, they were reminded multiple times throughout the year that we wouldn’t be able to make this year if it was on the 30th. No issues came up until 3 days ago. And we never wanted them to change the date if they didn’t want to it’s up to them and I don’t expect them to change their schedule because of us.

1gqr1oh,AITA for not letting my 19-year-old sister live with me and my husband anymore? ,"I (24F) and my husband (23M) live in his parents’ basement suite as we save up for our own home. My parents and younger siblings live abroad, but I’ve been here with my two older brothers for years. Sadly, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and my family came here for better healthcare. Unfortunately, she passed away three months ago, and now the rest of my family has decided to stay.

My dad and younger brother live with my eldest brother Mike (32M), his wife, and their baby. Their home isn’t big enough for my 19-year-old sister, so they asked if she could stay with us. We agreed, feeling bad for her.

However, it’s been a nightmare. She sleeps in the basement living room, which she keeps messy. She wakes up around 5 p.m., doesn’t help with housework, doesn’t cook, and spends all her time playing video games. She can’t work here due to visa issues, so my husband and I pay for everything—food, utilities, etc. She never thanks us and expects everything handed to her.

I’ve been on stress leave from work for two months and have taken on most of the cooking and cleaning. Everyone else works, so I’ve been doing my part. I’ve tried to get my sister to pitch in, like serving herself when I cook, but she complains. Recently, she asked for something, and I snapped, saying no. She got upset and said she “hopes she follows Mom” because she’s “being abused” here. My husband and I were furious. We’re doing everything for her, and she says that?

She started posting on Instagram about how she’s a “victim” here, all while still living in our space. She even told Mike that she doesn’t want to stay with us because “no one is taking care of her.” Mike told her, “You’re 19; figure it out.”

We stopped talking, but she’s still living here. After two weeks of silence, I finally told her to pack her bags and find somewhere else to stay. Even my in-laws, who have been angels and incredibly helpful to my family, subtly hinted they don’t want her here anymore. For them to say that is a big deal.

My other brother Josh (26M) has a studio apartment and agreed to let her stay with him for a while. But now, a week later, Josh’s landlord says she can’t stay anymore. Josh is now telling me she’ll have to come back to us. He didn’t ask—he just told me she’d be back on Thursday.

My husband is furious. He thinks it’s ridiculous that Josh is dictating what we should do in our own space, especially when we’ve been driving him around because he doesn’t have a car. I told Josh that just because he’s older doesn’t mean he gets to boss us around when we’re already doing more than our share.

We talked as a family, and Mike said our sister is now me and Josh's problem. My dad can’t take her due to visa issues and health problems, and we don’t want to stress him out. I know she’s grieving, but that doesn’t excuse her behavior.

1gz47nj,"AITA for ""ruining"" the Holidays due to placing our mom in LTC?","So, I(28m) have two siblings Theo(35M) and Abby(38F). Our mother had a stroke back in 2019 and our father passed away in early 2021. I have been taking care of her since. I dropped out of my graduate program to take care of our mom. 

Since January things with our mom became more stressful, increased memory issues, lack of sleep, and I was generally burnt out. During this time my siblings did not offer any assistance. They have families and lives. It fell on me because at the time I was staying with our parents in their apartment in NY since  I was going to school in NY. 

Each year I would fly or drive to VA so our mom can see my siblings and her grandkids. I found a place for our mom back in February and I informed my siblings they had no objection at the time. Now that major Holidays are coming around they have been asking me if I am going to bring mom. I told them no I was not but if they wanted to take her they were 100% free to take her. I told them she is not in a prison and I did put them on the list for approved people to take her out. 

They told me they could not do that it would be far too complicated. I told them that is unfortunate but I am going on vacation so I would not be available. Now all of a sudden I have everyone and their mother reaching out to me telling me how selfish and heartless I am being towards our mother. 

I pretty much lashed out at Theo who is hosting this year and told him off. I told him he has no right to call me selfish. I was the one that stepped up to care for mom after her stroke and our dad passed. I handled the sleepless nights, the wandering, the outbursts, the doctors appointments. I handled getting her Medicaid, I handled everything and put my life on hold to do so. 

They got to see the pleasant side of our mom and if she had an outburst I was the one that had to deal with it. Them he said I should have asked for help. He claimed he figured I had it all handled and did not need help. 

I told him I should not have had to ask I was 23 when mom had her stroke and 25 when dad passed. You knew I was stressed and was handling everything. I told him he did not even offer to help me setup the arrangements for our dad's funeral. Neither did Abby. 

He said he cannot read minds, I should have asked. So in that moment I said fine and asked him can you come pick up mom so she can go over for Thanksgiving. I will cover the travel fare. He came up with excuses like it was short notice. I said fine what about Christmas and again came up with an excuse.

After that I told him this is why I did not ask because you fucks will always come up with an excuse to get out of it. I told him that is how you two have always been. 

Apologize for the borderline rant, I am just pissed atm.

1gmw22d,AITA for giving my sister 30 days notice per the rental agreement she gave me?,"So, my friend (F 23) and I (F 22) found a house that gives us our own space. I currently rent from my sister a studio apartment. My sister (F 26) has been talking about wanting to move w her boyfriend once his lease is done by next year. Her boyfriend lives an hour away. She offered to take me with her and let me rent again, but I’d be an hour from work if I went, and the traffic is bad there so it would be even longer. We applied for the application, got the lease last night, so we told my sister last night. She gets mad at us and says we lied to her about looking to move. I never lied to her and informed her that if there was a house that had the space I want, I’d pick that over moving with her and told her I was looking at houses in the area with my friend. She’s claiming we screwed her over and are leaving her with the responsibility of taking care of bills she can’t afford. 

She makes a lot more than me which is why this house with more room makes more sense. I’d be paying less for more then I have now. She is now is being passive aggressive and giving us silent treatment because she feels we did her wrong. But we gave her 30 days notice as any normal roommate situation would be, and are paying extra rent to make up for how long we’d stay before having to move.

1gnl02d,AITA For Telling My Mum I Won't Be Giving My Son Her Last Name,"Hi reddit, I'm a 21F who's expecting my first child with my partner of almost 8 years (20M). Our son is due in less than 2 months. For this story to make sense, it requires some backstory.

My father isn't in the picture, so my immediate family is me, my mother and my twin. About 3 years ago my maternal grandmother died. I didn't have a relationship with her and neither did my mum due to them always fighting. My grandma was quite wealthy and when she passed away she left me and my twin half a million total in a trust that we couldn't access until we were 25. She left my mother nothing.

My mother got a lawyer and got money released early from that trust  with the condition that me and my twin gave her half of our inheritance each. If we hadn't agreed to give her anything, she would of gotten NOTHING. Our mum then convinced us to put all the money into a trust of her own for our family exclusively for education and housing, saying it would build stability for future generations. I used this money to get a house that me and my partner currently live in.

Since my mum found out I was pregnant, she's been very pushy that we use her last name (which is currently my last name). It's a traditional Scottish name with a capital letter in the middle and a lot of use of the letters 'M' and 'N'. I dont like this last name, its hard to pronounce from just reading. I also fully intend to take my partners last name in the future. 

Three months ago I told her we wouldn't be using her last name and would be using just my partners last name. This set her off, calling me petty and ungrateful. I apologised for upsetting her and asked if we could have a conversation about it so I could understand why it upset her. I expressed that I love her and I don't want her to be upset. She refused, saying it was my child and I could do what I wanted. I assumed she had come to terms with it and moved on.

Fast forward to last week. I got a text from my mum saying the following:
""By the way, I've made changes to the trust. [Her last name] needs to be your child's surname if you want him to benefit from the trust. I haven't worked this hard for the future to support a [partners last name]. Thats just the way it is. My last name or bust. I'd rather take the lot and spend it.""

This upset me. I asked her to give me some time and space to think about what she's done. She then went off at me about how her hard work wouldn't be wasted (even though she herself said it would be set up for future generations like my kids). She wouldn't even have any money to blackmail me with if I hadn't agreed to give her half of my inheritance after her own mother screwed her over.

I have gone no contact. But I'm starting to wonder if I'm the asshole for not just using her name to keep her happy in order to make sure my son gets access to that money. I dont want him to miss out just because his grandmother is an entitled piece of work. So reddit, AITA?",AgileAbbreviations11,1617,375,0.9200000166893004,0.1314662554483818,1731189243,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gnl02d/aita_for_telling_my_mum_i_wont_be_giving_my_son/,2024,11,AmItheAsshole,2024-11-09 21:54:03

1gmu6xo,"AITA for not reacting properly to my friend group's ""Suprise AirBnB"" booking?","**\[Context\]** every year our friend group hosts a Secret Santa event. A major part of this tradition involves booking an Airbnb where most of us (around 12 people) plan to stay, though not everyone ends up sleeping there. Typically, we spend a few hours on Discord searching for Airbnbs that meet our criteria—location, capacity, budget, etc.—and bookmarking options for further review.

This year, our entire friend group followed the usual process, spending hours searching through listings and bookmarking potential choices to revisit later. Then, about two weeks ago, half of the group (let’s call them Group B) suddenly stopped communicating with us (Group A) and went completely silent on Discord for an entire week. This abrupt change left Group A confused, prompting us to ask questions about what was going on and why Group B had stopped communicating with us.

Suddenly, a few days later, Group B’s main planner—the person who typically leads our event coordination—announced that he had booked a “surprise” Airbnb that was within budget and located in a great area. While Group A appreciated the effort, we requested more details, wanting at least some basic information about the place. However, the planner refused to provide any specifics, repeatedly responding with ""trust me"" and informing us that each participant would need to contribute $60 (more details on that later).

As days passed, Group A grew increasingly confused and uneasy about this Airbnb, which we were expected to help pay for, without any assurance or photos of what we were actually funding. Then, a friend close to some members of Group B (we’ll call him “J”) let us know that the planner had recently purchased a house where everyone in Group B would be moving in. While we recognized this as an impressive feat for Group B, we were still confused by their continued insistence on presenting it as an Airbnb that we needed to contribute 60$/person toward.

With this information, Group A tried to get confirmation from Group B, but they wouldn't budge, even as the Secret Santa event came closer. J also told us that part of the so-called “surprise” was that we wouldn’t actually need to pay anything, since the planner owned the house.

Finally, last night, Group B revealed the truth: they had moved into a newly acquired house, and it would be the location for our Secret Santa event. Group A wasn’t thrilled about the week of lies and secrecy over something we had initially believed was an Airbnb we were expected to fund.

Group B is not happy with us, claiming that we acted essentially like babies for not being more supportive of their actions in getting this house for our event.

1gyaske,AITA for refusing to give my friend the money i made from reselling her concert ticket? ,"I (m22) and my best friend (f22) have been friends since we were in preschool. Recently, a popular female singer came to our city and we both wanted to go, so we looked into tickets to buy. She asked if her boyfriend could also come, which i had no issue with. I bought the tickets for the three of us, and they both sent me the money for their tickets.

A few days before the show, she was telling me about how her boyfriend really didn’t want to go to this concert, and how he felt uncomfortable watching a female performer in a leotard. She was telling me how he was not gonna interact (no cheering, clapping, etc.), and was refusing to split parking costs at the venue, even though we previously agreed to do so. I told my friend “if he doesn’t want to come, no one is forcing him”. I didn’t mean it to sound harsh, but if he is that uncomfortable with watching this performer, then why agree in the first place? Eventually, they decided both of them were not going to come to the concert anymore. 

I told them that is fine, but i would still be going by myself. They then asked for me to send them their money back, and i refused. Whether they choose to go or not, those tickets are already paid for, and if i send them the money back, i just paid for three tickets by myself. I told them I would transfer their tickets to them and if they wanted to resell them to make the money back, they could. They told me they did not want to put in the work to resell them, which I then offered that I could list them and if they sell, i will send the money back to them, but if they don’t, then they are out of luck. They agreed to this.

I ended up selling each ticket for about $65 more then i paid for them, and i sent back their money that they paid. Everyone was happy, and I enjoyed the concert. Recently, they found out that i actually made about $130 from their two tickets, and said it was unfair that i didn’t send them the extra money because they were their tickets, even though they got a full refund of what they initially paid. I told them that i did the work to sell them so i kept the additional money that I made from selling the tickets. They called me an asshole and now our mutual friends are saying I should’ve sent them all of the money I received. I think it is ridiculous and truthfully i don’t understand the big deal, the event has already passed and they received their money back. so AITA?

1h59slu,AITA for yelling at my sister for putting her phone on DND and leaving her 1st grader at school without picking him up?,"Today at 4 PM, my nephew’s elementary school called me. He’s 7 years old and in 1st grade. He had been left at school for about 40 minutes after dismissal, and the office said they couldn’t reach anyone on his emergency contact list. They asked if I could get in touch with his parents—my sister and her husband.

I tried calling both of them, but their phones were on ""Do Not Disturb."" The calls would ring once and go straight to voicemail, which was odd because their phones should usually ring a few times before going to voicemail. Since neither of them was reachable, I got concerned and decided to go pick up my nephew myself.

While I was on my way, I kept trying to call my sister. She finally called me back about 90 minutes later, saying she and her husband had just been napping. I was furious. It felt incredibly irresponsible for them to leave their child stranded at school and silence their phones, especially as parents of a young child and a toddler.

Her excuse was that her husband had asked his grandparents to pick up my nephew, but there was a ""miscommunication."" I told her that even if that was the plan, she shouldn’t have put her phone on ""Do Not Disturb,"" because emergencies like this can happen. Her response shocked me—she said she likes putting her phone on ""Do Not Disturb"" during naps and, if I was going to react this way, she would remove me from my nephew’s emergency contact list. She also added that I was the last contact on the list anyway because her in-laws (the grandparents) were listed first.

She then accused me of overreacting, saying that ""normal people"" wouldn’t get angry about something like this. She even mentioned that she’s made a lot of new friends this year and now understands how ""normal"" people act. I found this insulting because I was the only one responsible enough to answer the school’s call and make sure her child was safe.

She continued justifying herself, saying it’s normal for people not to answer their phones if they’re busy, at work, or in meetings. She insisted that having her phone on ""Do Not Disturb"" was necessary because she naps with her toddler and needs complete silence. By the end of the conversation, she tried to make me feel like I was in the wrong for being upset. She said I had a right to be concerned but no right to be angry or yell at her.

She then added that she doesn’t like spending time with family because “there’s always an argument” when she talks to us. This left me completely baffled. Instead of showing any gratitude for my help, she threw backhanded insults at me, even though I was the one who ensured her child’s safety. Her reaction made me question whether I was wrong to be upset, but I still feel her behavior was irresponsible and ungrateful.",flippingnoob,14245,2281,0.9700000286102296,0.9954387489139878,1733183813,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h59slu/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sister_for_putting_her/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-02 23:56:53
1hbg0jb,AITA for refusing to share my “special” recipe with my cousin who wants to use it for her business?,"
So here’s the deal. I (18F) have this amazing dessert recipe that I came up with after months of experimenting in the kitchen. It's a unique twist on a classic treat, and everyone who tries it says it’s incredible. My family always asks me to make it for gatherings, and honestly, I take a lot of pride in how much people love it.

Recently, my cousin ""Jess"" (24F) started a small baking business from home. She’s been doing pretty well, and I’m happy for her! Last week, at a family dinner, Jess pulled me aside and asked if I’d give her my dessert recipe so she could add it to her menu.

I was flattered at first, but then I told her I wasn’t comfortable sharing it because it’s really personal to me—it’s my “thing,” you know? Jess didn’t take that well. She said I was being selfish and that it’s not like I’m starting a business or anything, so why would I hoard the recipe?

She even got my aunt (her mom) involved, who called me later and said I should “support family” and not be so “stingy.” I explained that I wasn’t trying to be mean, but I worked really hard to create that recipe, and it’s something I’m proud of.

Now half my family is calling me petty, and the other half is staying out of it. Jess posted a vague rant on Facebook about people “gatekeeping creativity” and how it’s “impossible to get ahead with unsupportive people.” My mom says I should just give her the recipe to keep the peace, but I don’t think I’m in the wrong here.

1hf3hjd,AITA for accepting cake at my friend's birthday party?,"So this is a bit of a weird one. I (41M) was at a friend's birthday party on the weekend just past. There were 9 of us at the party including the birthday boy (which is surprisingly relevant). All fake names from here on out.

Amy (30ish F), one of the guests, baked a cake for the birthday boy. After the relevant party traditions of singing the birthday song, and the hip-hip-hooraying that happens after the birthday song here in Australia, I went back to talking to one of my friends when Amy came up to me and the other friend with 2 plates of cake and offered them to my friend and I. We both said yes, thanked her, and then she made a really odd face and walked away. My friend and I both said it was weird, and went back to chatting. I ate some of the cake and it had desiccated coconut inside it, which I don't particularly like, so after a couple of bites, I ignored it and then chucked it out when the party ended about an hour or so later.

About 45 minutes ago, Steven (30ish M), Amy's partner, sent me a series of angry texts (8am on a Monday morning is really not the best time to receive angry texts) saying how Amy spent last night crying about how she didn't get to eat any of her cake and that I took a slice of it only to throw it away and deprive her of her own cake, and that she only cut 8 slices since she knows I don't like coconut, but I took her slice and threw it away to spite her. I replied, ""Why did she even offer me any cake if she knew there was coconut inside?"" Steven said that she did it to be polite and not leave me out, and that I was an asshole for taking her slice and throwing it away.

I forwarded the message to my other friends that were there, and most of them have left me on read so far, except one who responded with a thumbs down emoji, and another who hasn't seen it yet (as of this writing). The fact that no one's responding to me is making me worry that I might have been the asshole here.",LeoHyuuga,10941,2186,0.9800000190734864,0.8588340018400835,1734299790,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hf3hjd/aita_for_accepting_cake_at_my_friends_birthday/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-15 21:56:30
1h4g4rp,AITA for drama over pink wedding dress,"Throwaway account

Me (26f) and my fiance (26m) are getting married this coming May. Last week, me and my parents were discussing plans for the wedding. For the longest time (since teens perhaps), I have had my heart set on a pink wedding gown. That color makes me feel the prettiest and (I believe) suits me more than white. My mom has known about this interest, but always thought it was one of those fancies which would ""go away"" once I grew up and actually decided to get married.

Well, here we are. When I brought up the pink wedding dress again during our discussion, my mom and I got into a serious argument about it. She said that it would be childish and embarrassing of me to get married in a gown that color and she doesn't want me to regret in the future looking back at my photos. I argued that there was nothing embarrasing about wearing a color I like on MY special day, and even James didn't mind what color of the dress I wore. I also said that regret could go either way and I could end up regretting NOT wearing pink in the future so I'd rather go with the decision that makes me happy right now. Although my dad hasn't been as vocally against the pink dress, he is starting to side with mom seeing how upset she is getting over this.

Over the whole week, there has been no end in sight to this argument, with my mom bringing up multiple times how they won't pay their half for the wedding dress if I go with pink (the initial agreement was to split the bill 50-50). My brother (30m) thinks the whole argument over this color is ridiculous and told mom that he'd be happy to split the bill with me instead, and *they* might end up being the ones regretting this whole drama more than me regretting the color in the future.

I honestly feel so torn over this. I am not sure anymore if I want the pink dress that badly just because I feel hurt the way my parents reacted to it and made such a big deal out of it. On the other hand, this is what I have always wanted but I do feel like this small of a decision is causing a hige drama for no reason.

1hi5pmy,AITA For Not Letting A Woman Cut The Line At The Grocery Store? ,"Hi Reddit. I need your opinion on grocery store etiquette and not letting someone cut the line. Tonight after work I stopped by my local grocery store to grab a handful of items to make dinner. 5 items in total. I maneuvered my cart behind an older woman who was slowly navigating putting her groceries on the belt to be checked out. She was the only person I noticed in front of me.

A few minutes later another woman tries to edge her way in line in front of my cart. I gave her a quizzical look and she said ""Oh, I was here before, but I went to go and see if the other line over there was moving faster.""

I said, ""Okay, but you weren't here when I arrived soooo (shrug).""

The woman proceeded to inform me, she was here first and that she should be let back in because she only stepped away to see if the other line was faster. I replied that I did not see her here before I joined the line, so, she could get behind me or go back to the other line.

At this point she showed me that she only had a few things and was shocked that I wasn't going to let her back in (she had 4 packs of jello). I pointed out that I too only had a few things and I wasn't going to move because I did not see her in the line in front of me when I joined.

Now this is where I may be the Asshole. At this point we're both getting frustrated in this grocery store pissing match for pole position. She says ""So you're not going to let me back in? Where's your Christmas spirit?"". I'd had enough of her entitlement at this point and I shot back ""Don't pull that shit.""

Honestly, if I had been behind her in line, I would have happily held her place if she has asked. But she wasn't there when I arrived and she just assumed she could cut back in line after a few minutes. Using Christmas Spirit as a means to get what she wanted was the last straw for me.

In the end she, glared at me and said ""I hope you have a Merry Christmas"" her voice dripping with sarcasm. And she left to go back over to another cashier.

The irony is, we both left the store with our items at the same time.

So Reddit, am I the Asshole for not letting this woman cut in front of me and calling her out when she tried to use ""Christmas Spirit"" to get her way",Fit_Track3827,8888,1319,0.9700000286102296,0.5984591206572093,1734649406,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hi5pmy/aita_for_not_letting_a_woman_cut_the_line_at_the/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-19 23:03:26
1hf5o9t,AITA for telling a child no?,"Recently at a school event, the teacher asked if the parent group I'm a part of could provide cookies and cocoa.  I thought it might be nice to also provide things to add to the cocoa,  in this case marshmallows, whipped cream, and sprinkles. 

I had a child tell me that she doesn't drink cocoa and asked for just a cup of whipped cream. (Note she and her friends were the first in line. ) As she ate the chocolate chip cookies, I'm fairly certain it wasn't an allergy to chocolate, just a preference to not drink cocoa.  As soon as she asked, the five other kids wanted to have just a cup of the whipped cream too. So I could see where this would end up.  So I told her no,  that I was sorry,  I only had a limited supply of the whipped cream and if I told her yes I'd have to let everyone do it too and the people behind her in line wouldn't have the cream to add to their cocoa.  I offered her a cup to grab some water, but she stomped away mad.  Five minutes later, her mom came up and asked for a cup of whipped cream, and there was another immediate chorus of people wanting cups of whipped cream too. So I explained again about the whipping cream and the people in line, and mom stomped away mad.  A teacher who was attending the event with her child and not connected to the class or parent group (only add a child in the class) came up and asked,  with the predictable round of ""me too"". I again explained as there is still a line out the door and down the hall,  and only having a certain amount of whipped cream available, if I say yes to this child, I'll have to let everyone get cups of cream too, so I was sorry,  but the answer is no.  When this unconnected teacher caught me with my back turned, she took the whipped cream anyway and gave it to the child.  Which started an avalanche of folks wanting the same thing.  So I kept having to say no,  sorry,  no for the next 45 minutes until everyone had made it through the line.  I will say that we didn't end up running out,  but the last person to use it got the very last bit outof the last can.

The youngest crammed himself between me and his sister and started throwing an absolute tantrum- pushing his sister, yelling at his dad who was trying to pick him up (saying “let me go! I hate you dad!” To which his mom replied in a sing song voice “we don’t talk to daddy that way [insert kid’s name].” 

The people in the aisles behind this mess moved back to their seats to make room for the little girl he was pushing back and the mom - in a much sterner voice than what she used with her tantrum throwing child, asked me “can you please move your body out of his way?” At first I assumed she was talking to her husband because he was crammed in the aisle too.  But when she said it again and tapped on my shoulder I realized she was talking to me.  

I couldn’t move forward because there were people in the row ahead of me grabbing their bags, and I still needed to get my bag down as well. 

Meanwhile the kid is still screaming.  So I simply said- “I’m sorry- I need to get my bag” to which she responded - “well your butt is in his face!”

At that point I wasn’t going to sit back down in my seat to accommodate her family of four crowding into the aisle. So I stayed, grabbed my bag, and deplaned.

1hdm9b8,AITA for keeping food from my wife?,"My wife loves fruit. She eats a lot of it and I, as the person who buys most of the groceries, try to keep the place constantly stocked. Apples, peaches, figs, plums, whatever is in season, it's on our counter. Right now it's persimmon season. We both like very different types. She likes fuyu and she likes them firm. I like any kind, but mostly hachiya and like them the texture of pudding. So I leave mine to ripen which can take days to weeks sometimes. Neither of us likes the other's style much. 

This week we got a bunch of each at the farmer's market. I left mine be in a basket in the corner of the kitchen. She ate all of hers by mid week and I got her more at the market and she ate those too. I just stared eating mine today and offered her a bite. She said, no, I'll get my own. And I said, no way, those are mine. I've been saving them and you know how much effort it takes to get them the way I like it, and you don't even like them that way.

She got upset at this and said this has been my thing our whole marriage. I designate food as mine. All food should be anyone's to eat if that person wants it at that moment, she says. I, personally, disagree with this. And I live my life leaving her what is hers, whether it's half of the leftovers or half a piece of cake or whatever. I don't just eat things. I consider her.

1hi3tz1,"AITA for ""Booping"" my MIL's nose when she kept touching my baby bump","Hubs and I are 31 weeks pregnant with our first.  We announced our pregnancy at 13 weeks and everyone was SUPER excited since they will be the first grandchild on either side.  I started showing at about 4.5 months and initially tried to be patient with my mom/MIL/Grand Parents/Aunts/Random old-lady-at-the-store when they wanted to touch my belly.  I wasn't crazy about people constantly rubbing my belly like I was some Buddha statue but let it go since everyone was excited.  After a few weeks I got touched out and politely asked people to stop or would nicely say no when they asked, which most people respected.

MIL tends to be overbearing and pushy.  Very much has main character syndrome.  Gets pouty and grumpy when she doesn't get her way. She was the only one that continued to constantly touch my belly even when I tried to say no. She'd always say she's just so excited she can't help herself. The bigger I got, the more it happened.

A couple weeks ago we were visiting DH's relatives for an event and and as soon as we walked in MIL made a beeline over to us.  That day I was just feeling icky - big, tired, uncomfortable, you know what I mean.  I put one hand up to stop her and tried to cover my belly with the my other hand.  She brushed my hand aside and and started rubbing my belly.

So that's when I got super annoyed and gently ""booped"" her on the nose.  I even said ""Boop"".  She just looked really confused and we ended up walking away to go talk to other relatives.  As we were leaving that night, she put her hands on my belly again and as soon as she did, I booped her again.  

We saw her again some days later with one of her friends.  Her friend asked if she could touch my belly and I nicely told her my stomach was all touched out and she was fine.  No drama.  While that was happening, MIL snuck up on my and started rubbing my belly again.  And I booped her on the nose again.

She looked really annoyed and said how irritating that was and asked why I kept doing it.  And I told her that if she was going to keep rubbing my belly after asked her not to, I was going to boop her on the nose. She got mad and said I was being childish and dramatic.  That night she called my husband crying and said I was being mean and embarrassed her in front of her friend.  DH got annoyed with me and said she was just showing how excited she was and that she's from an older generation so it wasn't nice of me to do that to her.  Instead he said I should have talked to her (again) and explained why I didn't want people rubbing my belly anymore.

So the reason I'm wondering if IATA is because I know she is super excited, by nature she is a very touchy-feely person, and I think she was legit embarrassed that I did that in front of her friend.",ThrowRAyetAnotherOne,4442,1017,0.9700000286102296,0.376809229936945,1734644274,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hi3tz1/aita_for_booping_my_mils_nose_when_she_kept/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-19 21:37:54
1hc7izk,AITAH: My kid wants me to drive 3 hours a day taking them to/from work. I said no. ,"My 20 year old child was offered a job 45 minutes from our house. They have no drivers license yet, and a car that was given to them, but they do not drive due to having no license.

They were just offered a job at a location 45 minutes from our house. Taking them to/from work every day would take me 3 hours. I work from home, and I have responsibilities. Also I just do not want to drive for 3 hours every day. I wouldn’t do that for ANY job. My kid says I should be supportive and drive them, but I am just not going to do it. I told them that this was an unreasonable request, and I’d be willing to do one trip (1.5 hours) only. There isn’t run public transportation here either. AITAH?

Edit: I use the words “child” and “kid” because they are non binary, not because I am implying that they are not an adult.

Edit 2 for more info: They did have a learners permit at one time and allowed it to expire. They did not want to learn to drive with our cars because we have two stick shift vehicles. They have had a car for 4 months that is not a stick shift. A long standing anxiety disorder/therapy is ongoing. We moved to the country(not near public transportation) one year ago from a more urban suburb with public transportation. My adult child does currently have a job 20 minutes away and I spend 1 hour and 20 minutes each day going to/from there. This is due to driving there, going back home (I wfh), then going back later to pick them back up.

Edit 3: For everyone telling me that I need to “check my math” or something of that nature: dropping someone off at work (then going home), then picking them up later in the day (I work from home, so this means driving back to get them) is FOUR 45 minute trips, not two. This is a very basic word problem, and the solution is that all of these 45 minute trips equal 3 hours. 45 x4=180 minutes.

1hcxi0a,"AITA for refusing to give up my seat at a family gathering because my cousin is ""too old to sit on the floor""?","So, a bit of context: I (19F) am really close with my extended family. We often have big gatherings, and everyone typically sits in a large living room for dinner and hangouts. The seating arrangement usually consists of couches, a few chairs, and a couple of bean bags. There’s also a large rug where people sit on the floor.

Yesterday, we had a family dinner, and I ended up on the comfy couch by the window. It’s the prime spot in the room – near the food, great view, just perfect. My cousin, Myra (38F), was sitting on the floor near me with a few other people. Myra has always been a bit dramatic about things, and she started complaining that she was too old to sit on the floor anymore. She made a whole big scene about how her knees hurt and how no one had the decency to offer her a chair.

I don’t want to sound mean, but I was really comfortable and didn’t want to give up my spot. I jokingly said, ""I’m also not getting any younger and my back hurts, but this is where I’ve been sitting all night."" Myra kept insisting that I should give her my seat because she ""deserves it"" and ""it’s the least I can do."" At this point, I was getting pretty frustrated because, honestly, she wasn’t the only one sitting on the floor—there were at least 4 other people down there, younger and older, who were managing just fine.

I told her I wasn’t moving, and that she could either join the others on the floor or figure something out. This led to an awkward silence for a while, and eventually, my aunt (Myra’s mom) pulled me aside and scolded me for being rude. She said it’s family, and I should be more accommodating.

Now, I feel like maybe I was being too harsh. On one hand, Myra’s being dramatic about her age (she’s not *that* old), but on the other hand, I can see how it might’ve come off as inconsiderate. My cousin still won’t let it go, and I’m wondering if I was out of line.

1hltmaz,AITA for getting engaged after my brother’s wedding?,"EDIT: paraphrased some direct quotes and removed some potentially identifiable info. 

My brother and his now wife got married three days ago. A very small destination ceremony under 15 people total. My now fiancé and I extended our trip after everyone went home and spent a couple of days exploring the Grand Canyon, a couple hours north of the wedding, where he proposed. 

When I shared the news with my brother and now SIL, he responded with hostility saying that it looked like we were competing.

I apologized, quickly realizing that he was advocating for my SIL and that she felt hurt (although I’m truly failing to understand why). I also texted her a separate apology and explained that it was not our intent to encroach and just wanted to share the news with family and that it’s my belief that there’s room for happiness for everyone. She did not respond. 

In response to my apology, my brother doubled down and said the timing and location were hurtful and that we shouldn’t planned around the wedding.",andthatsfine,7407,16,0.959999978542328,0.2634611989086359,1735100679,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hltmaz/aita_for_getting_engaged_after_my_brothers_wedding/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-25 04:24:39
1hhex71,AITA for not attending Christmas dinner with my family because it’s at 1 o’clock in the afternoon? ,"For context, I buy the Turkey at £130, dry brine it for 2 days, cook it, take it to my mums house and then cook all of the trimmings while I’m there. This involves many hours of work from me as you can imagine and I have to wake up at 7AM to get all of the timings right. 

The problem with this is that my partner and I barely get any time together on Christmas Day, we’d like to wake up, have a coffee, spend time together, open presents, maybe have a light breakfast and then get to cooking dinner at midday. 

We don’t usually eat breakfast or lunch as we intermittent fast and we’re never hungry for a giant plate of roasted food at 1 o’clock in the afternoon, effectively ruining the Christmas meal for us anyway. 

When children were involved and everyone had to get home early I compromised, even though I still didn’t really understand the whole eating at midday thing, but this year now the youngest child in attendance is 12 I tried to meet them in the middle and say could we maybe have it at 3? 

I’ve been told that I’m selfish and that I don’t compromise and that this is ridiculous. Thus I’ve decided that my partner and I will go round to see the family in the afternoon but not eat dinner with them. We’ll have our own meal at home in the evening, saving me money and allowing us to have the Christmas morning we’ve not had since we first lived together in 2018. 

Additionally, I’ll be able to experiment with flavour for once, sous vide a turkey crown, use the giblets for the gravy etc. 

I also feel it necessary to add that everyone rushes off as soon as they’ve finished eating anyway, there would usually be 8 people in attendance including us and except my mum and brother everyone else leaves, I think it wouldn’t be so bad if we spent the day together after the meal?

1hgo739,AITA for stealing a present from a child?,"Last week was my office holiday party with a White Elephant gift exchange. The party invite was for employees and their significant others, so children were not specifically discouraged but through conversations in the office it was clear that people were not bringing kids. One of my coworkers ended up bringing his 10-year old daughter to the party. She is a regular around the office and he often brings her to work events, but at this party she was the only child.

White Elephant is a game where everyone brings a wrapped gift and the first person chooses a present. The next person can either choose a new gift to open or steal a present that someone else has opened. If your gift is stolen you can choose a new present or steal. 

During the gift exchange, which was light hearted and had a mix of real/silly gifts, someone opened a small hand carved and painted wooden dragon. My husband has played DND his whole life, loves dragons, and this was right up his alley. We had both already taken our turns, but agreed that if either of our gifts were stolen we would go straight for that. 

Along comes the kid’s turn. There were other kid friendly gifts available, but she decided to steal the dragon. Several rounds went by and we debated whether it would be alright to steal the dragon if the opportunity came up. It would be fine according to the rules of the game, but since the kid had it would that make it wrong? We ended up undecided, but leaning toward that it was all a game especially since the kid had stolen the item from someone else. 

Eventually my husband’s gift was stolen so he had the chance to pick a new gift or steal. He made a joke about being the Grinch, and chose the dragon. The kid seemed disappointed, but picked another gift and the game went on. She ended up with a remote control Harry Potter wand that was actually pretty cool.

After the exchange was over, she asked my husband if he would trade items. He said kindly but firmly that he was happy with his item and wanted to keep it. Later, I went to the bathroom and found her crying. I told my husband and we went to her father offering to give her the dragon since we didn’t realize she was so upset. He said that it was a good lesson for her and she had actually talked enthusiastically about stealing gifts from people before the whole thing started. 

My husband has the dragon and is happy with it, but it is now a little tainted by guilt. The office seems to be split on the issue. Many people said that he should never have even considered stealing the item from her because she’s a kid and might not have fully understood the game. We don’t have children so may be out of touch on this issue, but the more I think about it the more I feel like she shouldn’t really have been at the party in the first place, and her father shouldn’t have allowed her to participate in the game if she couldn’t understand the possibility of an item getting stolen.

So I genuinely want to know, are we the assholes?",lauradecker1,3825,423,0.959999978542328,0.2261342632758792,1734478702,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hgo739/aita_for_stealing_a_present_from_a_child/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-17 23:38:22
1hc7ofx,AITA for telling my daughter’s father that I will not be doing a Quincenera for her?,"Background: I’m 35(F) and have a 13(F) daughter who wants a Quincenera and I’m not comfortable spending that much money on one event. I’m a Hispanic woman who was born in the US so I’m not a traditional Mexican and my kids are Americanized.

Here’s where the issue comes. My daughter’s father (36) who lives with his mom, pays nothing in child support because he’s in debt(owes IRS/credit card debt). I pay everything for my daughter (school activities/sports/hobbies/clothes/trips) you name it, I pay. I don’t ask her dad because he’s already paying child support for another son he has with an ex. I am fortunate that my fiancé and I make a good income and can afford to be debt free by choosing to make wise money decisions. I have a full-time job, do contract work on the side, and part-time Masters student at my local University (debt-free).

My ex approached me when I dropped off my daughter and said that our daughter wants a Quince and she wants a party where all her family is in one place. I told him I wasn’t doing a Quince but I’d throw a party in our backyard and he was invited. Our house is nice and our backyard was done a few years ago and is big. The other day he said that his cousin had a baby shower at a ranch style and that its $3K for the venue for 250 people. On the phone I freaked because I have a lot on my plate and know how much work it takes to plan an event with a lot of people. He said his family is easily 100 people. I have a lot of family too but I was only planning on only inviting close family and friends. When I tell him ""No this is not a Quincenera but a party with food and DJ with tops 100 people"" he tell me that ""I'm starting to really disappoint him"" and I tell him that I have a lot going on and that I can’t plan something that big with all the stuff I already do and that I don’t want to spend a lot of money. Quinceneras are a lot when you think of the dress/dolls/walce/damas/band and etc. they are time consuming and a lot of money goes into them. He gave me $200 the other day and was planning to give me $100 each pay day. He’s never given me that much money for her since we separated when she was 1.

I have final exams this week and I haven’t been able to sleep for 2 nights thinking of all the stress this is causing me. Should I give him his money back and tell him that we should each do what we can for her on our own?

1h7n5af,AITA for refusing to sleep in pajamas when sharing a hotel room with my BIL,"This past weekend I (25m) was invited to my wife's cousin's bachelor party. We split off into hotel rooms of two and since I didn't know a ton of people there I roomed with my wife's brother. He's a couple years older than me, and we've gone to the gym together and whatnot but have never been amazing friends. 

The first night there was a decent amount of drinking. I noticed when he got into bed that he wore a sweatshirt and sweatpants. I ended up wearing one of those tank top undershirts and my underwear. I don't think he noticed until the next morning when I took off the covers, and he asked if I had anything else to sleep in. I told him I really only brought jeans but I'd be happy to keep them by the bed and not sit around and talk to him like that tomorrow. 

We had some free time during the day and then had a chiller dinner the second night. When it came time to get to bed he pulled out some pajama pants and a cheap long sleeve shirt and said he brought them for me. I told him I'd wear the pajama pants if it was important to him but I wouldn't wear the shirt. He said it was awkward and admittedly my shirt is one of those tight undershirts. But idk why that matters to him. I ended up getting annoyed and not even wearing the pants to sleep and he said that I wasn't being a good temporary roommate, arguing he was doing a good deed by rooming with me and not one of the people he's closer to.

We do not live together. I’m planning on getting a dog soon. I’ve always liked big dogs you can wrestle with. My girlfriend of 8 months is more fem than I am, and is really into small dogs. She wants me to get something like a shih tzu or Pomeranian, but I’m looking for something 60+ lbs full grown. She says I should get something like a pug as a “compromise” since we have talked about our future together. She said if I’m unwilling to compromise, it means I don’t care about her or our future. I don’t want a small or medium dog. I want a large or even XL breed or mutt. It will be living at my house. Am I being unfair by “refusing to compromise”?

1hkb4ij,AITA for getting my sister chocolate for Christmas after she hasn't put any effort into my gifts?,"Throwaway because my siblings follow my main account. I (18NB) am getting my sister (15F) a chocolate box for Christmas this year because for years now she has not bothered with my gifts at all, Christmas or birthday. Usually she gives me stuff she's been gifted in the past like bathbombs or makeup which I can't use due to skin irritation and also feeling gender dysphoria when I wear makeup. She is well aware of this as I politely tell her when I open the presents. She doesn't have a job and therefore no income which she uses as an excuse despite the fact our parents give her quite a bit of money to buy people gifts for Christmas and birthdays. Last Christmas, she got our stepsister the dress and book she had asked for whereas I got an eyeshadow palette that I had seen her using the week prior and I notebook I had given her for school which she hadn't used. I thanked her for it but later reminded her that I couldn't use the makeup. She shrugged and said ""well at least I got you something"".

What upsets me the most is our dad has a whole thing about us getting gifts for relatives that have a lot of thought and meaning. I say us but it seems this rule only applies to me. I get her the things she asks for every birthday and Christmas. I pay attention when she mentions wanting something in passing and make sure to get it for her when her birthday and Christmas come up. She doesn't.

A few weeks ago, I did my Christmas shopping and I knew she wanted two specific posters for her room but decided because she has made little to no effort for me, I would get her a box of chocolates from Hotel Chocolat. I got a type of box she has said she likes in the past though just because I didn't want to be an utter jerk.

This evening (the 22nd of December) we were having dinner and my sister mentioned she was going out tomorrow to do last minute Christmas shopping. I said ""are you actually going to get me something you've never owned this year?"" as a joke which I realise I shouldn't have. She said ""what's that supposed to mean?"" and I mentioned how she never puts effort into any of my gifts where I always do. Then I said ""well, as I always did"" which was a bit of a dick move on my part. She asked me what I meant and kept demanding to know what I got her for Christmas despite me telling her it would ruin the surprise. Our dad chimed in and demanded to know what I got her so I said ""a chocolate box from Hotel Chocolat"". She went off at me saying that she didn't want a chocolate box, she wanted posters and I responded ""you never bother with my gifts, why should I do the same?"". My dad is saying I need to go out tomorrow and my sister is calling me selfish and ungrateful. I feel quite childish and have apologised to her but she doesn't care.

1h6v3dk,"AITA for taking a 40-minute break to play football during my ""paternity"" leave?","I (M) took 5 days off work to help my wife with our 3-month-old son. For context, I'm the sole provider working a full-time job plus side gigs. During the first 4 days, I did a good chunk of the caregiving (except for feeding since my wife breastfeeds). Not perfect, but I was doing substantially more than usual.

On day 4, I saw some guys playing football in the park and asked my wife if I could join them. She agreed, though somewhat reluctantly. I left for about 40 minutes total while the baby was calm. When I got back, the baby was still feeding and drowsy, but my wife was clearly angry and giving me the silent treatment.

When I asked what was wrong, she said it was unfair that I could take breaks like that while she couldn't. I acknowledged what she said but didn't apologize since I honestly didn't think I'd done anything wrong. As I was leaving the bedroom, she started going off on me, and I just told her I didn't know what to say.

1hc61sr,AITA For throwing out my flatmate's rice cooker and clearing out her part of the fridge after she left the country to go home for Christmas? ,"Me and my flat mates are all uni freshers: me (18), Madison (18), Simon (20), Robert (22), and Liam (19) (all fake names btw). One day, Madison pmed me saying she didn't like how I talked to her in the flat group chat. I'm a very jokey person so though I might of gone too far with my sarcasm, so I apologised straight away. She then didn't reply to my message and didn't come back to the flat for weeks. I got worried as her life 360 was off too.

Simon messaged the group chat:

Simon: ""Yo guys, whose cooker is that? 😅"" (picture of a mini rice cooker).

Madison: ""Mine, lol.""

Simon: ""Inside is only just mould hahah okay.""

Liam: ""Crazy stuff.""

Madison: ""Oh what.""

I gagged when I saw the picture as I remember sitting in the kitchen with her as she cooked that rice. Last month 💀. I took another picture of the rice to send to chat - adding that her avocadoes also went mould and that I few them out. She didn't reply. The next day I reminded her to throw the rice away, it was making the kitchen stink. She responded: ""Has anyone seen my pot?"" 🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️. I pmed her twice reminding her - no reply. I finally caught her at 4 am in the kitchen with her friends. I apologised again to her in person and reminded her to throw away her rice. She told me it was ok and said she would. (she didn't - it was there for another few days) I triple-bagged the rice cooker and left it by the bin, sharing a picture in the chat: ""Madison, please throw your rice away 💀.""

Madison: ""I’m not even there y’all, and I lost my pan."" (she left to go back home for Christmas break in Thailand)

Me: ""Madison, I told you multiple times to please throw that away. It’s a health hazard.""

Madison: ""Bruh, just put it where the vacuum is.""

Me: ""No—it’ll heat up and grow more mould.""

Madison: ""Nah, there’s a lid.""

Me: ""It’ll attract bugs and rats.""

Liam: ""I threw that shit in the bin fr. Was nasty.""

When she left for Christmas, she didn’t clean her fridge section. I threw away food that was going to expire over the holiday, open sauce packets leaking on the shelf, curdled milk, cookies, eggs, and vegetables pooling water. My flatmates said her side of the SHARED fridge was filthy for weeks. I messaged the chat with what I’d done.

Madison: ""K.""

I sent her a video of me clean-up. She complained I was disrespecting her space, claiming the sauces were still fine to eat and expensive. She accused me of nagging and said I shouldn’t touch her side of the fridge area since I don’t use it (I share a mini fridge with Robert). She also said the sauces were expensive. I kinda feel bad for clearing her stuff out, especially as she was having personal problems in her life and was trying to heal. And I did call her a bad word on the group chat  after her ""K"" responses💀. But it was going to expire over the holidays, and as I'm staying in the flat during Christmas, I don't really want to smell that...

1hgo8f4,AITA for telling my mom’s boyfriend his kids will never be family,"Roughly more than a year ago my mother introduced me to her boyfriend. Since then me and my 3 siblings have been introduced to his three kids and our families have been ‘merged’. Though we still live in separate homes, his family is over our house all the time, but it’s very obvious he is purposely leaving me and my other older sibling out of the ‘family plans’. Last year during thanksgiving, I was informed 3 days before that ALL of his kids (including his adult child) and my 2 younger siblings along with my mother were going to meet our grandparents 6 states over. Me and my older sibling were whiplashed as we didn’t have enough time to pull together funds or time off to join them, we brought this up to our mom and she simply said she guesses we can join them next time and she thought we knew. That left me and my sibling alone for a week during thanksgiving, in which we each just ended up going to a family members house who we don’t see often. We were both very hurt by this incident, and brought to each others attention how many ‘family trips’ they have had (whether it’s a weekend thing or not) without inviting us or telling us until the day of. We’ve kept our mouths shut until now, but since Christmas is coming around, we were getting nervous they were going to do the same thing, thankfully they didn’t but we were told to be sure to get his kids gifts as they are now ‘our siblings’. Having to get gifts for 3 people who we aren’t even close to really sucked, but my sibling and I begrudgingly did so. I don’t remember how it got brought up today, but I found out his kids weren’t getting ANY of my siblings gifts, not even the adult despite them all having jobs. This really pissed me off and I ended up lashing out on both of them, specifically my mother’s boyfriend. I told him that I don’t care about him or his kids, but if he wants to play family he’s not playing the ‘father’ act well at all. He retorted with he doesn’t need to share his life with adult kids and to him we’re just our moms past. I’ll admit I got nasty after this, telling him his kids are baggage enough and my mother doesn’t need anymore kids, and I’ll never look at his spoiled rotten brats as family. This seemed to really hurt my mom and she started crying, her boyfriend screamed at me to leave so I did, I’m staying at a friends right now but I’m wondering if I went to far. I don’t give a fuck if I was the asshole to the boyfriend, I already know that part. But was I an asshole to my mom in this way too? I just don’t want her to forget that she has 2 kids who still see her as their mother and she can’t just forget they exist because her boyfriend won’t acknowledge us. 

Edit: I am 20 and the “older sibling” is 17, I only said older because they are older than my two younger siblings who are under the ages of 10. I pay half the rent and half the household expenses in the house with my mother and without me we wouldn’t be housed (I think everyone knows how expensive it is to live on your own right now, let alone with 3 kids excluding myself). I will be going back home and understand he can’t kick me out of a place my names on the lease on, but I am trying to cool myself down. Did this update to clear some things up for people. 

Update: I came home pretty early this morning to have a talk with her mom when her boyfriend left. I took a lot of your advice and told her how leaving me and my sibling out is not blending the family in any manner, and how I feel like my own home is being invaded despite my contributing significantly. According to my mom her boyfriend didn’t end up spending the night due to them having their own fight. My mother made it very clear that she was pretty ignorant to everything we felt, whether it was on purpose or not, but she started crying last night not only from what I said, but everything her boyfriend had said as well. A big part of their talk after I left was discussing me and my sibling, she didn’t tell me everything they said but they will be taking time away from each other for a little while as my mom agreed that at some point he can’t just leave me and my siblings out, but she also feels I was rejecting him and his kids early on along with my siblings and it’s why she didn’t ‘invite’ us to a lot of things because she didn’t want to put us in uncomfortable situations. This led to me bringing up the fact that I pay half the rent and I would prefer from now on they go over his house in the future, and how I need to see respect from him and his kids and not treat me like a ghost in a house I contribute towards. She understood and said that she herself won’t be seeing him for a while. This then ended with her sobbing again that at some point I will be getting married and the kids need a father. Our dad died roughly 6 years ago due to terminal illness, at this point my parents were already separated but since then my mom has really only had flings, nothing serious. And the older I get the more she fears I’ll leave her in the dust and she will have no one to help her with my siblings or the future. (I know a lot of people said this but I thought maybe you guys were just assuming but I guess she was feeling like she needed to secure herself). Similarly, his kids mom has been dead a little less than 4 years for a similar reason though I don’t know all the details. My mother said multiple times that she can’t expect me to live with her forever and take care of her at the drop of the dime, and how she has been wanting a full time companion for a long time for stability but also for companionship. By this point she had to leave for work and we decided to put a pin in the conversation. I don’t think I’ll be updating much further than this. I thank everyone for the advice and the consideration they gave to my post. I still feel like an AH but I do feel a little less shitty setting the boundaries I did considering over half of you said I should have done it sooner. Thank you, I appreciate it.",AnyAnybodyy,2446,347,0.959999978542328,0.1612239299902201,1734478808,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hgo8f4/aita_for_telling_my_moms_boyfriend_his_kids_will/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-17 23:40:08
1hedkxt,AITA for Refusing to allow a Recent Widower to have his Annual Christmas Party in my house?,"So we recently bought our house from a man with 2 kids who lost his wife a few months back and had to downsize. We didn’t speak to him much throughout the moving process but recently he sent me an email telling me that he and his kids are really struggling with the move and the loss of his wife. He said that his wife loved Christmas and used to throw a big holiday party every year for the neighborhood and his current house is too small. He said he wanted the holidays to be normal for his kids since it’s his first Christmas without his wife. He asked if he could throw it at our house in 2 weeks and he said he’d pay for and deal with everything and that he could probably use things we already have to decorate.

I feel really bad for the guy but there’s a few reasons I need to say no. The first 3 are not that important but the last one I would say is. Firstly, 2 weeks is very short notice. Second, we’re Jewish and have absolutely zero Christmasy decorations, third the day he said is my husbands birthday and I’d like to celebrate with him that day. All that stuff is kinda petty and can be worked around. 

But we recently got relicensed as foster parents in our new house and a little over a week ago took in two young kids who recently went through a very traumatic life event. I’ve taken off work the next month to stay home and support them. I don’t know how they’ll be in two weeks but I don’t want to confirm that they’ll be ready to have a lot of people over and interact with them. I’ve only left the house with them twice for a little over an hour each time and both were not pleasant experiences. I don’t know if they’ll be able to be out of the house for hours during the party in public or in someone else’s house.

Right now my family is my top priority and I understand his is too which is why it hurts that I have to say no to him. I’m not asking if I should or shouldn’t, I’m not going to say yes. I’m just asking if it makes me an AH. I feel like if I talk about my foster kids he will suggest ways around it and I don’t want to give him the full sob story with everything he’s going through.

1hiub40,AITAH Wife claims IATAH because I contacted pediatrician to add note on daughter’s first menstrual cycle,"So….

Am I out of line on this?

I take kids to most of their doctor appointments because my work is more lenient on taking time off / making up time than my wife’s job. 

Daughter had her first period. 

So I asked the pediatrician’s nurse to give me a call. When they did I asked them to add the date so it was logged properly and I wouldn’t have to worry about not remembering it correctly when we go to the doctor the next time. 

Wife blew up. 
Quite literally told me “keep your man business out of her menstrual business”

Now in my mind my daughter is the shy anxious type and I didn’t want to have her get all stressed at doc’s trying to remember the exact date. 

So…

AITAH? 

I figured I was telling our kid’s doctor something to add on her chart, just like I did when we went to urgent care and she had strep. 

Wife feels I’m out of line. 

Need outside perspective because honestly not thinking I overstepped but willing to apologize if I did.

1h95fol,AITAH for skipping the bathroom line to wash my hands?,"Basically what the title says - I (30sF) was recently at the airport for a flight. I went to the ladies' bathroom to wash my hands about 15 mins before boarding (so I could have waited). There was a line of about half a dozen women, and I made eye contact with the one at the front of line and told her I was just going to wash my hands. She had no issue with it. There were 2 sections of sinks, and I went to the one closest to the entrance. The next 5 sinks to the left of me were all unused in the time I was washing my hands. 

As I walked out barely a minute later, a woman towards the end of the line cupped her hands around her mouth as if to broadcast to everyone and said in a very condescending tone ""there's a lineeeee"" and laughed at herself. I was so taken aback that anyone had any issues with this that I only managed to mutter ""I was just washing my hands so ..."" as I walked out. I really didn't see an issue with what I did cause I did not cause anyone to wait in line any longer than they would have, nor did I take up a sink that people ahead of me needed.

1hefc4l,AITA for refusing to help my sister with childcare after her son bullied mine?,"Throwaway because some of our mutual friends have my main.

So I (28 F) have a four year old son, Max, with my husband, Tom (29M).  Max was born with cerebral palsy and needs some accommodations.  The main two are his crutches for walking and his AAC. An AAC is an IPad/tablet like device that lets him tap pictures/icons to communicate. Just because he can't physically form the words doesn't mean that he doesn't have meaningful thoughts. He operates and communicates just like any other four year old, and likes to talk about typical things. 

  
My sister Jane (30 F) has two kids, James (10M) and Lucy (6F). Jane is a single parent and works longer hours than both me and Tom. To help her out, James and Lucy take the bus to our house every day. We feed them dinner, and make sure they do their homework stuff like that. Jane comes to collect them between 7-8 every night. Well, Wednesday night, the kids were playing as usual when we noticed James start pretending to walk weird, and make strange sounds. It was exactly the way that Max walks and talks. Tom immediately told him to cut it out. 

He kept doing it though, with Lucy laughing. Max started to get upset. Tom called them both out of the family room and scolded them quite severely. He didn't yell or anything, but was firm. James got very quiet and sat at the table until Jane came. 

Thursday, he did it again. When I asked him why he said that ""His mom told him it was okay."" My blood boiled. I told him he could sit at the table for the rest of the night. When Jane got there, Tom and I took her into the other room. She said that she ""didnt see the big deal"" and that he was ""just joking"". I told her that ableism was never funny and if her kid couldn't act right, he wasn't welcome anymore. She said I was being overprotective, and that people were bound to be mean to Max, and he should learn to deal with it early. I told her my four year old should feel safe in his own house and that I wouldn't help her anymore. 

She said I wouldn't dare, took her kids and left. Friday morning I called the school and told them not to send James and Lucy on the bus to my house. They offer an after-school program that you have to pay for that goes until 7 pm. When Jane arrived to pick them up, I told her that her kids were at the school. She flew into a panic and left to get them. This morning, I started getting texts. How dare I? What was I thinking? I reminded her she would have to pay the bill and her tone shifted dramatically. Suddenly she was so sorry and that she would talk to James. I told her that the damage had been done, and they were no longer welcome. She told me she couldn't afford it. I said it wasn't my problem. Now she's really upset, and might have to find another job.

1hkz735,AITA for not allowing my daughter to quit piano?,"Over the summer, my daughter Annie (14) asked for piano lessons. My wife and I were surprised since Annie had never shown any interest in music. But Annie assured us that she was serious. Since she’s a straight A student, we didn’t doubt her.

It's also important to note that my wife and I have a rule that our kids can participate in any (reasonable) extracurricular activity, but they have to stick with it for a year/season before they can quit.

Annie started lessons in right as the school year started. She practices for at least an hour every day, and her teacher has spoken positively to us about her dedication and rapid progress.

Earlier this month, my wife and I went to the end-of-semester recital that Annie’s teacher requires his students to perform in. We thought that she played beautifully, but during the car ride home Annie told us that she wanted to quit piano. I asked why, and she said that she was embarrassed because a. She played the same piece as a 6 year old and b. Emily played a well-known Chopin piece. 

Emily is Annie’s former best friend. Since both girls are very competitive and were always at the top of the class, they went from friends to frenemies. AFAIK, they still hang out in larger group settings but not one-on-one.  

I reminded Annie of the ""no quitting before a year"" rule and suggested switching piano teachers if she wanted to avoid playing during the same recital as Emily. But Annie said that it didn't matter if she switched teachers because Emily already knew how ""bad"" she was at piano.

Thankfully, my wife is 100% on my side here, but several family members who are w/ us for Christmas have said that I should let Annie quit piano.",CarefulSalt5503,1171,448,0.9200000166893004,0.1384088309370672,1734993087,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hkz735/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_to_quit_piano/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-23 22:31:27
1hbc5pn,AITA for Refusing to Let My Brother and His Wife Name Their Baby After Me?,"(Throwaway because my family uses Reddit. Names are fake, but the situation is very real.)  


Hi Reddit, I (32F) am currently in a weird situation with my brother, Jake (29M), and his wife, Rachel (28F). They’re expecting their first child, and everyone is super excited. I was too — until they told me about their name choice.


Last weekend, Jake and Rachel made a big announcement. They said they had ""finally picked the perfect name"" for their baby girl. **It’s my exact first and middle name.** Let’s say, for the sake of this post, my name is Emily Rose. They want to name their daughter **Emily Rose [Last Name]** — identical spelling, too.  


At first, I thought it was kind of sweet, but then Rachel said, “we just love how it sounds, and it’s such a strong, classic name.” I asked if they were naming her after me, and Rachel laughed awkwardly and said, “not really, we just love the vibe of it.” So, they’re not even honoring me — they just like my name and want to copy it.  


I told them I was uncomfortable with this. I said it felt weird to have a niece with my exact name and that it might cause confusion in the family. My mom agreed that it was odd, but Jake brushed it off, saying, ""you don’t own the name, it’s not that deep.” Rachel added that I should feel ""flattered,"" not ""territorial.""  


I tried to suggest some similar alternatives, like Emma or Emilia, but they shot down every suggestion. Jake said “we’re set on this name, and it’s happening whether you’re on board or not.” I told them if they go through with it, I’m setting a boundary: I won’t answer to my name at family events if someone calls it, because I’m not playing the ""which Emily are you talking to?"" game.  


Now, Jake and Rachel are calling me petty and immature. My mom says I’m being dramatic, but my dad actually agrees that it’s weird. My friends are split — some think I’m making it a bigger deal than it is, while others say it’s bizarre and creepy.  


To be clear, I know I don’t own my name, but I just think it’s strange to name your kid after a living relative and not even acknowledge that connection. They’re acting like it’s some random, once-in-a-lifetime idea they came up with on their own.

1h6sdc5,AITA for not letting my sister-in-law live with us indefinitely?,"My (36F) husband's (38M) sister (28F) recently went through a tough breakup and asked if she could stay with us temporarily. She has a history of being irresponsible, often quitting jobs and relying on family to bail her out. My husband convinced me to let her stay for **two months** max, with the understanding that she would get a job and start saving for her own place.

At first, things were okay. She mostly stayed in the guest room, but she quickly started pushing boundaries. She began ""borrowing"" my clothes and makeup without asking, cooking elaborate meals and leaving a mess, and inviting friends over late at night without letting us know.

I confronted her about these things, and she apologized but didn’t change. The real issue started when she made **zero effort** to find a job. She spent her days watching TV, ordering takeout, and complaining about her ex. My husband and I both work full-time, so we’d come home to a messy house and her lounging around.

Last week, I sat her down and told her that since it’s been **three months**, she needed to leave in two weeks. She broke down crying, saying I was being heartless and she had nowhere else to go. My husband sided with her, saying I was being ""too rigid"" and that she just needed ""a little more time.""

I told him that if he wanted her to stay longer, he needed to take responsibility for her—meaning he’d need to handle her meals, clean up after her, and manage her behavior. He got defensive and said I was ""making this into a power struggle.""

Now, my sister-in-law is telling the whole family that I’m kicking her out while she’s ""struggling,"" and they’re calling me selfish. I think I’ve been more than fair, but my husband is still upset with me, and I’m wondering if I’m being too harsh.

1hefulh,WIBTA if I don’t call out of work on Christmas Eve to go to family dinner?,"So 3 weeks ago, I (20F) started working at Target and on my 2nd day of work, I had to call out because I woke up throwing up. A team lead talked to me about my call out the next day I came to work. I’m scheduled to work from 2-9:30pm on Christmas Eve and my mom isn’t happy about that because we are supposed to go to my Grandparents house for dinner like we usually do every year. She told me that I’m going to have to call out but I don’t want to risk getting in trouble since I recently already had a call out. I was also hired as a seasonal worker since that’s what they had available and I’m trying to have them keep me permanently and if I call out again, especially on a holiday, that will affect my chances of them keeping me. 

My mom got mad because I said I didn’t want to call out and she started guilt tripping me and saying “it’s messed up that you won’t be at family dinner” “I can’t believe your going to go to work on Christmas Eve” “I don’t understand why you can’t just call out so you can have dinner with the family”. This would only be my first time not going to dinner and a few of my older cousins won’t even be there because they are busy with stuff. WIBTA if I don’t call out of work?

1hlsetw,AITA for telling people I'm not having fun when they ask and I'm genuinely not?,"This one is general. I am a guy who, when I don't enjoy something, I'll tell you I don't, but if I commit to something, I'll see it through to the end without complaining.

This comes to a head where I was on vacation with my older brother in Arizona, who wanted to do a lot of nature hikes. Nature hikes are fine. I don't *mind* them, but I do dislike walking up large hills. Walking downhill is the easiest thing ever, it's like being nature's passenger princess. You just put your foot forward and let gravity do all the work. Walking uphill conversely is very draining and leaves me sweaty.

I don't make a point to complain about something when I do it, so when I was walking uphill, despite not liking it much, I held basic conversation with my brother. 

As we were heading back down, he asked me if I was having fun and I said no. Not because of any fault of my brother, I just didn't find the activity fun. Not even bad, just satisfactory. Later when he was driving me to the airport for my flight home he told me ""If I ask you if you're having fun, don't say 'no.'""

I understand that it can be demoralizing to hear someone's not having fun, but I don't like it when people ask for my opinion and get upset when I give my honest answer. If I'm not having fun, I'll just say I'm not having fun.",Ness_Lucas,3318,39,0.8399999737739563,0.124932811335939,1735095597,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hlsetw/aita_for_telling_people_im_not_having_fun_when/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-25 02:59:57

1hhelb4,AITA backing out of all social events because 1 person I don't like is there,"Throwaway for privacy. I need a truly impartial judgement because everyone I've asked has some skin in the game and is mixed on view.

I (25F) don't like this girl Ellie (28F). I also work with her, at one of my two jobs (important for later). I think she's annoying, wayyyy too performative and I've also caught her telling random lies to our coworkers. I don't like being around her and only interact with her at work if I have to. 

Me and my group of friends were out at a bar a few months ago and Ellie coincidentally was there. She walked over to me to say hi and is now part of my friendship group. All of my friends know how I feel about her, have heard her crazy behaviour at work and why I don't like to be around her. However, the majority of them like her (we're a group of 9) and she's been embraced.

Ellie is a part of our group chat. Most of the time when we make plans, she comes too. I brushed it off the first couple of times but now I've decided not to go to anything where she's also coming. Because I work two jobs, I only have 1 day off a week/fortnight it varies depending on shift patterns. I really value that time and decided I don't want to waste it being around someone I don't like. I've never tried to play the hand of me being in the group first or issuing an ultimatum to pick one of us, I just decline and sit at home. 

As a result, I see my friends about once a month instead of a few times a week (after work when I have energy or on my day off) because I don't want to see Ellie for 8 hours where I can't stand her and then proceed to be in her presence for the rest of my evening. Everyone in the friend group has picked up on it and constantly invite me to plans where Ellie is also attendinng but I keep my stance firm and decline. 

My two friends who like her the most, Grace and Jess, are calling me childish and say I'm forcing them to choose between us but I insist I'm not and I'm happy staying at home (I really am, I can't stand Ellie). They keep calling me to change my mind, even created a separate chat to talk about it but I don't budge and they think I'm being an asshole about it and I should just be a bigger person and go anyway.

1hka1eh,AITA For Refusing to Celebrate Christmas Several Days Late Every Year?,"I'll do my best to explain this in an unbiased way.

For the last 10+ years my family has agreed to celebrate Christmas late (sometimes over a week late) because my sister and mom's side of the family generally celebrate with their extended families and nobody on their end ever reciprocates the favor and celebrates late on account of us. 

For some context, ever since my sister got together with her significant other, she started going to their family's parties every Christmas and year after year she asks my parents to celebrate Christmas at a later date so she can be there to celebrate. Sometimes it's the day after Christmas and sometimes it's days late or even in January. Never once has her SO's family celebrated late so we could celebrate on time. 

Secondly, my mother's side of the family usually joins us when my sister is available and they seem to go along with whatever my sister requests because they too have Christmas parties with their extended families. To their credit, one of my Aunts had Christmas Eve at her house for years, but ever since my sister got into this relationship, even my Aunt agreed to have our Christmas parties out of sync to oblige my sister's requests. Now, my Aunt has since sold her house and my parents are the designated hosts every year for the past several years.

I've been speaking out against this for years. My stance is that we should celebrate shortly before Christmas or Christmas Eve, or on the holidays themselves, not after. I say it's obnoxious that we have to celebrate late every single year while everybody else enjoys their holiday on time while we lie in wait. Every time I take a stand I'm met from my father with ""I'm selfish and immature and I'm being an asshole"". Granted, I do not have children while my sister does. She is kind of the golden child of the family and I'm kind of the screw up. She has a good job and makes a lot of money and her and her partner are millionaires while I have been an underachiever for most of my life and don't have much to show for anything I've done. Still, I don't think that negates my point.

If I'm being honest, it feels like my family doesn't want to have Christmas if my sister isn't there and they bend over backwards to accommodate her every year. I love my sister too and she is a good person at her core but I do think this situation is ridiculous and I feel that I have a point in standing up for my family's Christmas while my father and extended family seem to get manipulated. My mother always agreed with me, but sadly she passed away this past February and now I'm without any support on this subject.

AITA for pointing out that this seems messed up or am I just being a selfish assholes like my father says?  ",tkgb12,495,463,0.8600000143051147,0.1179392436994522,1734908258,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hka1eh/aita_for_refusing_to_celebrate_christmas_several/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-22 22:57:38
1h7l9lu,AITA for charging my family for my baking?,"There’s a lot of context, please bear with me haha :) 

I (15F) am a theater kid. I used to have a tradition of baking and decorating sugar cookies for the cast and crew of every show that I was in. The cookies started out relatively simple with very basic designs, but the casts I was in grew progressively larger, and over time my designs got more elaborate, until it got to the point where I would spend 12 hours in the kitchen baking cookies for 50 people, in addition to 3 other deserts for all of the people with dietary restrictions. The last batch I made for theater was in fall 2023, and then I stopped. I haven’t baked for any cast I’ve been in since then.

For the past 2 years now, my mom has hosted a December Christmas party at our house, with around 50-65 people attending. My sisters (twins, 13F) bake 3-4 deserts for the party, while I make my sugar cookies and a charcuterie board. The charcuterie board takes less than an hour, but on average, my cookies take longer than all of their deserts combined. For the past 2 years, I have made around 40 cookies for the party. My parents pay for ingredients.

T his year, we are inviting over 100 people. My mom has asked me to make 100 cookies, and offered me an incentive of $75 upon seeing my less than enthusiastic reaction. The cookie cutters I’m using this year are smaller than the ones I’ve used before; however, it will be significantly more decorating than last year, considering I quadrupled rather than doubled my dough recipe this year (at my mom’s request). These cookies will be a 4 day project (one day for dough, one day for baking, and two for decorating). I did the dough yesterday, which is the easiest part and still took an hour and a half. 

With the time commitment I’ll be putting in, I asked my mom to pay me an hourly rate for my cookies, which I haven’t done before. I would log how many hours I worked over the 4 days, and we could negotiate what that rate would actually be after the party was over. My initial suggestion was $20 per hour, which I am aware is high, but I was more than open to negotiating a lower rate with her. 

She told me that I wasn’t being generous and that I shouldn’t be charging her money because she’s family. She said that she had offered me the $75 as an incentive, but I should be making the cookies to contribute to the party rather than to make money, because baking cookies for her shouldn’t be considered a service. She said that it was unfair of me to charge her when I made the theater cookies for free. My dad agrees with her, and my sisters are mad that I’m asking for money while they’re making their deserts for free (which is none of my business, imo if they want to be paid they should ask). I don’t think I’m being unreasonable for wanting to be paid for a likely 12+ hour commitment, but I thought I’d ask here. AITA?

Some clarifications:
1. I did not accept the $75 and then change my mind. I said right away to my mom that I wanted hourly over a $75 flat rate. If I had done that I would have just stuck it out.
2. This is a 4 day project around school and homework. I'm in high school and finals are coming up.
3. The decorating involves royal icing and a few sprinkles. This website has some similar cookies: https://theamericanpatriette.com/easy-royal-icing-recipe/

UPDATE: My mom just told me to take it up with my dad, who agreed to pay me $15 per hour for my fancy designs, which is more than fine with me. After rolling out and baking all of the dough, I have 134 cookies and extremely sore hands lol. I'm starting icing tonight. If I can figure out how I'll post a picture of the cookies when they're done. Thank you to everyone in the comments who was civil and respectful :)",QueenMoonshadow191,408,475,0.7799999713897705,0.1174919698377561,1733436372,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h7l9lu/aita_for_charging_my_family_for_my_baking/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-05 22:06:12
1hlsety,WIBTAH for not going to my husband’s family’s Christmas?,"I am a first responder and have been for the last 3 years. My schedule is a rotating shift pattern (days/nights). The pattern is consistent and I can tell you what days I’m working very far in advance. Because of this, I told my entire family last year that I would be working on Christmas this year and reminded them when we saw them. This is the first time I have had to work on Christmas. 

My side of the family understands and we are celebrating with just my parents and siblings another day. 

My husband’s family is really into Christmas. Like everyone needs to be at SIL’s house at 8am to open presents together and then we spend the entire day together. So when I asked if we could celebrate together another day over the holidays instead it got shut down with statements like “Christmas is on December 25th.” or “I don’t understand, can’t you just ask for the day off?”  So I let them know my husband would be attending solo this year.

This morning while I was at work, my husband (who works a 9-5 and is enjoying his day off) texts me “it would be nice if you could come by for a couple hours tomorrow after work..”  I declined because:
1. SIL lives ~90mins away, so that’s 3 hours of driving. I would be driving home alone at night with not the best weather.  
2. My job can be very stressful and my social battery is drained by the time I get home.
3. We already agreed that it made more sense for me to stay home and to have him go to his parents house on Christmas Eve so they could drive over in the morning together.. 

Well my husband is pissed and thinks that I don’t want to spend time with his family. He’s been sending me passive aggressive texts all day trying to guilt trip me… “we don’t know how much time we have left with my parents…” It’s working because I feel like I’m letting everyone down and I don’t want his family to think I don’t want to spend Christmas with them.  

WIBTAH if I stuck to our original plan instead of making an effort to go see his family tomorrow after work?

*I am locked out of commenting till Jan 2nd so I’ll just reply here* 

Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond, I was really upset last night and it’s nice to get an outsiders perspective. One of the comments said “it’s not the date it’s the day” and I’ll be using that from now on. A couple of you guessed right, yes, part of my job is answering 911 calls. My husband mostly understanding of how our shifts work but I usually get pushback on long weekend or celebrations. I have been trying to convince him to come in for an observation shift so he can finally understand, but he’s doesn’t feel comfortable listening in on the calls.  

I haven’t confirmed but I think what may have caused him to even request my appearance is that his father, who is in the early stages of dementia, may have asked what time we were both coming over, forgetting I was not coming over.  

This shift schedule is still new to him, and he hates showing up to events without me and having to explain to everyone I’m not there because working. This is definitely something we are going to have to work out before we try and have kids. 

Thanks again everyone and Merry Christmas!

1h9vit9,AITA for being the only friend/spouse not to show up to help out friends move out of their house? ,"My husband(30m) belongs to a friend group of like 6 guys and their SO’s. They were all his high school buddies. I(27F) get along well with all of them, although we’re not friends outside of my husband. Occasionally the gfs/wives will do something together without the husbands but it’s rare. All of us have kids. 

Today my husband heard that Couple 1 has until tomorrow to be completely moved out of their house so he showed up to their house to help them move out. We have a 1 year old who doesn’t sit still and a few months ago we helped Couple 2 move but I was absolutely useless and in the way because I had to watch our kid and couldn’t be moving furniture or anything because of everything around to get into. 

Needless to say, I did not go help them move today. I’m also 18 weeks pregnant. Well today all of our other friends showed up. All of them! Which is great and I’m glad they had the help, until Couple 3’s wife sent me a snarky text about how everyone showed up except for me and it says a lot. I told her I’m not very helpful when watching our kid and she replied that they all had kids there and it wasn’t an issue for anyone else but good excuse. 

Everyone else’s kids are years older except for one who is only a month old so all he does is sleep. I feel like I’m being judged unfairly and Couple 1’s husband just tweeted about knowing who your friends are because of who shows up for you on your time of need. 
I tried to defend myself further to Couple 3’s wife because also pregnant so I’m not lifting stuff, but she had the excuse that couple 4’s gf was there and is also pregnant. Like that’s great but she’s 5 weeks along and just found out two minutes ago and also doesn’t have a toddler to watch on top of it. 

Now I feel like they all hate me and Couple 3’s wife never responded. I texted Couple 1’s wife apologizing that I couldn’t be there hours ago but she hasn’t replied either.

1hedo87,AITA for not gaining weight for my sisters wedding so she would feel thinner?,"So to provide context, about a few months ago, my sister, (23F) and I (19F) were both slightly overweight. Not exactly fat but we both would have handled losing 20ish lbs. So eventually I started working out and eventually lost 25 lbs, and I was very happy with myself and actually started to feel confident again. However, my sister had a busier schedule and she never found time to consistently workout. I knew she felt insecure about that because I was noticeably skinnier than her, but we both were able to move past that for a while, until she got engaged. Once she got engaged she really tried losing weight but was never able to lose more than a few lbs, and she was really stressing about that to the point where she would have meltdowns about it. Eventually our mom, 43F came to me and started telling me about how much my sister struggles with her body image, and said to me that she thought I should gain back the 25 lbs for the wedding, because if me and her were together for pictures she would look fatter than me, and she was really worried about that. I refused to do that because I worked really hard to lose weight and I wasn't going to lose all my work. However my mom was very mad at me saying stuff like if I loved her I needed to do what would help her, even if it is hard. I still said no, and my mom then told my sister and she has been ignoring me and my mom said that I could no longer be the maid of honour if I didn't gain the weight.

1h92wol,AITA for stepping out of the Xmas family trip because of their constant fits over gifts?,"This is the situation here. As per nearly every year, we make a Christmas trip to meet with my extended family and celebrate it. I (M33) am not much of a gift giver, and I actually don't mind not getting any gifts at all.

But, the problem at hand comes when my sister (F40) and my mother (F69) enter the scene. I still get some gifts from them, but they always seem to make a fuzz when I don't gift them back. This is an issue that has been happening over the latest years. And yesterday, my sister and my mother, in addition to some other relatives sat me down and they gave me an ultimatum that, either I show them that I care for them by giving them all gifts when we make the trip or they would tell the whole family to take drastic measures.

Since this isn't the first time my family throws a fit because I don't give them any gifts (and they haven't given me less gifts over the years), I just told them that if this is how they would do things, then I would not make the trip with them, then left.

Today, my phone has been blown with Whatsapp messages and missed calls, and all the messages so far go along the lines that I'm being selfish and greedy, and that I'm hurting them all because I don't care for them at all. I haven't grabbed the phone at all as a result.

For additional context, I live alone, my current job is moderately well paid, and maybe I could afford them a couple gifts, but the problem is that this is the same drama, the same guilt-tripping and this basically defuses any desire from me of giving out any gifts.

1hiujuq,AITA for asking a kid to please get off my porch and trying to find out where they came from?,"Reposting since I think it got deleted? Not sure how this works since this is my first one of these.
  So for reference, I (41 F) have generally had a cordial relationship with my neighbors, we don’t talk too much but we talk when we see each other or we need to discuss property stuff. 
  This afternoon I was out Christmas shopping and my security camera notifications start going off like crazy. I looked and it was someone’s kid (roughly 3?) on my porch, pulling on some of my decorations, then I saw them open my mailbox, and pull on the door handle. I saw no adults in sight through the camera. I immediately call my neighbor to see if it’s one of their relatives, no response. 
  I call through the camera speaker and ask the kid to please not play with things on my porch, they didn’t listen. I asked them to please go back to their parents. They stayed on the porch for like 10 minutes and I gave up. Finally I get angry texts from the neighbor, I guess it was a relative. They simply responded with “they’re just a baby”. I said, “look, all I saw was some kid I didn’t know on my porch opening my mailbox and playing with things while I wasn’t there, and it was stressing me and my cat inside out.” They got angry and said “ok cool, hey never ask us for anything in the future. He’s a baby and was just admiring your decorations” clearly pissed at me. 
  Was I in the wrong to be upset that there was a random child on my porch and trying to figure out who they were? I get the kid was young and curious but I personally would never let my kid go up and play on someone’s porch when they weren’t home or without permission?

1hltor3,AITAH for not allowing my mom to stay another week after her pipes burst just before Christmas?,"38/F I am celebrating Christmas with my mom 68/F, my brother 47/M and his family. My mom flew in from out of state and we are driving to a meetup location to spend time with my brother's family - a place in the mountains we all enjoy just for the holidays. All of us live hours away, our mom being the furthest, on the opposite coast. My brother and I are several hours away by car.


This year, we received the bad news that, while my mom has been at my place, her pipes froze and flooded her basement. She is upset, understandably, I helped her get everything started and have her insurance, a cleanup team and a general contractor all working on her place while she is with me. She then broached the topic that she wanted to extended her week stay to ""two weeks or more"". I said no, I need to get back to my regular routine and get ready to return to work. She's welcome to stay here as originally planned, which is until Saturday.


Then she said she may ask to ride back with my brother and his family to their home in another state (opposite direction than me). She refused to ask him until Christmas, so l gave my brother a heads up last night so he has a chance to speak with his wife. I also told him that he's under no obligation to say yes, as she is still welcome to stay with me until Saturday and her insurance company will be footing the bill for most of her stay at a hotel and meals (IF, BIG IF, her residence is uninhabitable, which we do not know at this time).


He told me he didn't have room to take her back with him (3 people in his car and no room for a 4th -assuming luggage is the issue). That I should let her stay with me because she's lonely. I told him I understood that, but I'm not wrong for wanting to cap my time with her at the one week originally planned. He had left that text on ""send"". My mom can be a challenging personality and with this unfortunate development, she's even more ... difficult. I love my mom, but I'm tired.

1hk8gy4,AITA For telling my mom to stop letting my brother get away with stuff just because he’s autistic?,"
I (18F) am the youngest out of three siblings. My oldest brother (22M) has autism. He doesn’t understand like everyone else does and is extremely smart in certain categories. Feelings are not one of them. He doesn’t understand when he does something wrong, and when he doesn’t get his way, things get out of hand.

My father has been on my side for most of this. My brother, who we’ll call Leo, always got his way. He has one cell iPhone, three iPads, a computer, a laptop, a playstation, xbox, wii, etc. I on the other hand have one iPhone and that’s it. When he gets angry, he smashes and breaks his stuff. We have had to replace electronics more than I can count. I tell my mom not to give in, but she tells me off.

She always has the same excuse. “Your brother is autistic, he doesn’t understand!” or “When you grow up you can get a job and start a family, he can’t.” And yes, the family thing is true. But she shouldn’t give in all the time. I tell her he’s not going to learn or that he doesn’t deserve it. I asked her for a monitor for my birthday, and instead I got books. She made up the excuse that we didn’t have the money, but the same day she gets him a new iPad. Which was over $1500. I realized that thats the reason she said no, was so she could get him that on my birthday.

1hgo1et,AITA for announcing my pregnancy to my family? ,"My sister in law (37f) has been trying to get pregnant for almost three years now and have had a very rough and tough time trying to conceive. It has always been a sensitive subject around the family and my husband (29m) and I (29f) have held back from having our second child due to this reason. 

We wanted to give her the chance to have a child before we tried for another one. We always wanted to have our first child to be closer in age with their next sibling. Our little one is turning 4 next year and we said now is the time. We tried and had a miscarriage. A month after that we are all happy after knowing we are pregnant again!

Overjoyed by news I shared the news to the family. SIL was upset on how I shared the news and family was pretty in the middle.. ultimately I can’t share my pregnancy to anyone until after my first trimester so I don’t hurt SIL feelings. 

A week after that happened, I shared a story on my social media of a funny skit of a pregnant woman wanting to eat healthy but her pregnancy cravings is telling her to eat chocolate instead. SIL was so upset and told everyone she won’t be attending Christmas with the family. And that I wasn’t understanding her and how hard it has been for her. 

 At this point, I just don’t even want to be pregnant… so people could stop making me feel bad for even expressing any small thing about pregnancy. 

Edit: I shared my good news through our family group chat that we use to communicate with each other. And I also shared it with my over seas friends on my social media when the baby was due.

1h8d3ga,AITA for suggesting my partner use a mini fridge for breast milk instead of storing it in our main fridge?,"Jumping in. My partner and I have been discussing the topic of having kids and whether we want them.

The topic of feeding came up, and I suggested using formula. However, my partner mentioned that formula can be expensive and said she could pump breast milk and store the bottles in the fridge instead.

I told her I wasn’t comfortable with the idea of storing breast milk in the fridge next to our food. I feel it’s unhygienic, and I don’t want to open the fridge and see the bottles on the shelf. Instead, I suggested that we could buy a separate mini fridge specifically for her and the baby to store the milk.

She wasn’t happy with this idea and said it felt like I was unnecessarily creating a barrier. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable, but I want to know—am I the asshole for suggesting this solution?

Edit: unhygienic was probably the wrong word. I understand the milk itself isn’t unhygienic. But being stored with rest of our food would be, I personally don’t want to open the fridge and see the bottles or bags of it, I think it would be off putting. 

I am fine with nappies and baby vomit. It’s just the idea of my partners bodily fluids being stored next to our milk and eggs that’s freaks me out. 

I would happily feed our baby formula. But my partner would like to try breast feeding 1st and pump so that when it comes to night feeds or giving her boobs a break I can help.

1hdpbch,AITA for wanting my engagement ring to not be my wedding ring after I get married?,"My fiancée (m34) proposed to me (f30) this year. We are very happy and excited for this next chapter in our lives. We plan on eloping next year. My engagement ring originally belonged to his grandmother. She’s almost 102 years old and was married for something like 50-60 years, so this ring has been around for generations. 

It’s very small/dainty, and I had to have it resized. Before I went for the resizing, I asked my fiancée if he would mind if I made alterations to the ring so it would suit my taste better. He originally agreed to this and said I could do what made me happy. 

While getting quotes from some jewelers, he changed his mind and said that he would prefer I keep the ring the way it is. I agreed to not alter it, but then asked him if he would be okay with me changing rings once we get married. He told me that he assumed that my engagement ring would just end up being my wedding ring, and didn’t understand why I wanted a new one. I explained that while I am very honored to have his grandmothers ring, I still want to have a say and choice of the ring that I end up wearing.

He was hurt by that answer and we made up when I said that I would put more thought and consideration into the whole thing. My mother in law to be suggested that I just choose my own wedding band/ring to wear along with it, but I am not a big jewelry person in general and don’t want to wear two rings together. 

I really don’t think I’m being selfish, like I said, I’m honored and grateful to be wearing something that has been in the family for such a long time and that holds a lot of meaning. I simply want to choose my own wedding ring. I still plan on keeping the engagement ring and intend to wear it as a necklace or something.

1hhdasf,AITA for screaming at my aunt to get the hell out after she called my little sister “Miss Trunchbull”?,"Using throwaway account because I know some of my family are on here. Sorry for any grammar issues English is not my first language.

My (17f) aunt (40f) and nieces (10f and 6f) came over to our house for a visit.

My nieces and my little sister (8f) were playing around the house. They were chasing each other around, I think they were playing tag.

Me, my dad, and my aunt (who is his sister) were sitting at the kitchen table drinking coffee when my sister and oldest niece ran past us. My sister was chasing after her. My aunt suddenly yelled out laughing, ""Don't fall on her and squish her, Miss Trunchbull!""

My sister and I had just rewatched the movie Matilda a couple weeks ago, but I didn't really get the connection until my sister suddenly got very quiet before going to her room in tears.

I looked up the character again on my phone and it clicked. I jumped up and started yelling at my aunt, that led to a screaming match between the both us until she grabbed her kids and left.

My aunt has always been almond mom to her daughters, always saying weird stuff that she ""has to keep them skinny"" and that she'll make sure they're models one day. She has made remarks before to my sister that she eats too much.

My little sister is chubby, not obese, but still chubbier than most of the kids in her class. She has gotten bullied for this before and is insecure of her weight. My aunt knew this since my sister genuinely loves her and talked to her about it before.

I couldn't wrap my head around why she would say something so hurtful. I went to my sister's room and she was crying. She asked me why she can't be beautiful and it broke my heart.

My parents said I overreacted, but I heard them talking in their room about how disrespectful it was that my aunt said that. I'm still grounded regardless.

It's been a week since then but my aunt called last night and basically said she won't see us until I apologize. Now, my parents are urging me to say sorry.

I feel like I was right to have stood up for my sister, but at the same time so I don't want to lose connection with my nieces. I'm really confused if I should apologize or not because maybe I did overreact. I just don’t know. 

So, MITA?",Calm-Perspective8009,977,219,0.949999988079071,0.0818600670468611,1734559938,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hhdasf/aita_for_screaming_at_my_aunt_to_get_the_hell_out/,2024,12,AmItheAsshole,2024-12-18 22:12:18

1hs6t1j,AITA for telling my girlfriend that her friend is too ugly for my friend?,"I’ve (29m) been with my gf (28f) for the past 8 months and it has been amazing. I’ve met her friends and I really like them all, and she’s met my friends and they all got along great. We are all hanging out together for the first time this weekend. The issue is that my gf has told one of her friends, let’s call her Sue, that she thinks she would be perfect for one of my friends, let’s call him Mike. She has told her this multiple times, shown her pictures of him, and gotten her all excited. My problem with this is that I don’t think they are a good match at all. Mike is a very good looking guy, in great shape, is 6’2” and is a lawyer. He has always dated very conventionally attractive women. Sue is great and I really like her, but she is just not very conventionally attractive. She is overweight and just doesn’t put much effort into her appearance in general. 

My gf has mentioned this potential match to me a few times, and I’ve always just kind of brushed it off with a “we’ll see” or “you never know” hoping it would just fizzle out, but after we made plans to all hang out and after I found out she has been telling Sue about it, I felt like I had to say something to her. I didn’t want Sue to get her feelings hurt, and I didn’t want to put Mike in an awkward situation. I told my girlfriend I think she should not try to set them up together, and to just leave it alone, and if something happens between them, great, but not to push it. When she asked why, I said I just don’t think they are a comparable match looks wise, and that I think Sue would get her feelings hurt. I said I don’t think they’re a great match personality wise either, since he is super active and she is much more of a home body. This caused a big fight (our first real fight) where she accused me of thinking my friends were better than her friends, asking who else I thought was “ugly”, etc. I was genuinely just trying to avoid an awkward situation, but I might have made it worse. Should I just have kept my mouth shut and let it happen?

1htqwgu,AITA for booking a hotel in the same area as my son and dil’s trip that we didn’t get to go on?,"My son and his fiancée of six years go on a family trip every year with her extended family. From what my son tells me, they travel to different locations and rent an Airbnb that accommodates the 30 people who attend. For the past three years, they’ve gone during the holidays, and as a result, we rarely see them. My future daughter-in-law (DIL) and I have a good relationship, but I can’t say we talk much.

My son and his fiancée are planning a trip in March for spring break, and I asked my son when we might be able to plan a trip together in the future. He mentioned there might be enough room at the house they’re staying at. I told him that sounded great and asked him to let me know the costs for everyone attending. My 24-year-old son, 22-year-old daughter, and 3-year-old grandson also live with me, so we all planned to go.

A few days later, my son told me that we’d likely have to sleep on a couch or share one of the kids’ bunk beds if they were available. I assured him we’d make it work, and I sent him our share of the costs. I also told my kids, who were very excited—this would be their first vacation that’s more than a three-hour car ride away.

Last week, my son called and told me it wouldn’t work for us to join them after all, and he sent back the deposit. When I asked why, he explained that his fiancée didn’t feel comfortable with us coming. She was upset because I didn’t attend her engagement dinner last year to meet her side of the family, which she felt would make it awkward to share the vacation rental. She was also upset that I didn’t reach out to her directly to discuss joining the trip, leaving my son to relay the information instead.

I told my son it was fine, but I ended up booking a hotel about 15 miles from where they’re staying. I also told my son he didn’t have to worry about making time to see us. Now, my DIL is upset because she feels that we’re still somehow taking away from their trip.

Last weekend, while we were away, he invited his female friend (Sarah) to stay over. When we got back, I noticed she had used most of my shampoo and conditioner without asking. I had splurged on these expensive products to treat myself. I also make a lot less money than my friend.

Today, Sarah came over again for a visit and asked to shower at ours before heading to a dance class. However, I had taken my expensive products to my room this time, leaving only my friend’s basic shampoo out for her to use. When she couldn’t find the conditioner, she asked my friend, who came to my room to ask me about it. I told him that she’s his guest, and it’s not my responsibility to provide spa products for her.

1i6u3os,AITA for declining to invite a woman who has called herself ‘a total klepto’ into my home?,"I joined a Women’s Social Club 6 months ago because I’ve been struggling to make friends after relocating to a new-to-me city. It took me a while to warm up to the group and to connect with people I actually had anything in common with. I had to wade through a lot of botox parties and boozy brunches to find things I was interested in. But I did, and I started coming to group events fairly often.

I hang out most often with the women who like to read, do crafty things, bake, skywatch, etc. Among these women is one, I’ll call her Andea, who has made several comments about how she’s a total klepto. I think that she makes these comments to seem “cool” to the other people in the group.

I reached out to some of the women I see regularly at these events and invited them over to my place to watch a TV show we’d been talking about and do crafty stuff. They were excited and agreed to come.

Unfortunately, Andrea found out (I assume someone asked if she was going) and reached out to me to ask if she was invited. I considered this for a bit and then told her no, as I only had so much room at home. She didn’t believe me and asked me for the real reason, saying “I thought we got along” which yes, is true. 

I told her I’m not comfortable inviting a kleptomaniac into my home. That I’ve worked hard to have the things I have and it would be stupid for me to invite her knowing that she openly brags about it. 

She said ‘Okay’ very quietly. She then said “You’re painting me out to be some horrible criminal when you don’t even know anything about me.” 

I said that her being proud to call herself a klepto was all I needed to know. She said that I was a high school mean girl and ableist. I am unsure what the foundation for that statement is.

This unfortunately has spilled over to the group, which is frustrating. But what has me the most surprised is that there are so many people defending her and telling me that I’m out of touch and take things too literally.

1id64xi,AITA for calling ski patrol on a guy after he hit my son with his skis?,"My son (11M) and I (44M) recently booked a trip to go skiing in Colorado. It was my son's first time skiing, but he had seen a lot of skiing videos on YouTube, and he seemed really excited for the trip. We also live in Florida, so this is not the trip you can just go and do whenever you like (we are not rich). I grew up in Utah and I loved skiing when I was younger, and I would say I'm an expert on the mountain. The first day goes all good, and my son really enjoyed skiing for the first time, even though he fell a lot, lol. I made sure to be as supportive and caring as possible, even when he was struggling, because I wanted to make this as fun an experience as possible for him. However, on the second day of skiing, he says he's finally ready to ski down the whole mountain, and so we take the lift to the top. Luckily, there was a way to get down the mountain while only staying on green level trails, so we took that way. 

My son is having a blast, when all of a sudden, this guy in his 20s careens into my son from behind going on insane speeds, wiping them both out. My son immediately started crying and came running to me after he got his skis off, and once he calmed down, he ran to the lodge where my wife was, and she decided to take him to the doctor's office. I immediately confront the guy for being so reckless, and he simply says that I should have been paying better attention to my kid, and then he rode off. That was the final straw for me, and I called the ski patrol number in the app and told the guy the situation and what the skier was wearing, and they told me they would find him and kick him out. Later on, I saw him getting escorted out of the park by two ski patrol officers, and when he saw me, he immediately started cursing me out and calling me a horrible dad.

1hxr5ew,Update: AITA for leaving my dad’s birthday dinner after overhearing my sister’s comment about my miscarriage?,"[link to my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/7nVIk1V4PJ)

Hi everyone, I want to thank you all for the support and feedback on my last post. This update is mostly about a few different conversations that I had.

I took your suggestions and called my dad, apologizing for leaving early. He completely understood. We talked a bit and he asked if we could go out to lunch this week because he missed seeing me, so we made plans.

Then, I talked to my husband and told him that I didn’t think I could’ve stayed and still thought leaving was the best thing for us. He apologized for invalidating my feelings and said he would’ve liked for us to spend time with family but not at the cost of my mental wellbeing. He offered to call my brother (not the one who texted me) to set up a playdate for our son with his kids so my son could see some of his cousins, which I appreciated.

Later, my mom called (I guess my dad told her we talked) and she apologized for taking so long to call, saying she felt ashamed and didn’t know how to talk to me. She said she wouldn’t have let Eva say that if they’d known I was there and that she didn’t mean it. Eva has been hormonal and frustrated, and my mom thought calling her out at that point would've just made things worse. She felt terrible for hurting my feelings. I thanked her for the apology but told her I needed more time before meeting her.

After this, Eva texted me, and I wanted to hear her out, so I called. She apologized a lot and emphasized that she didn’t mean it and regretted saying it, attributing it to the same thing my mom had. Apparently she and BIL also had a big fight about it when they got home, which delayed her talking to me.   
  
We had a long conversation, in which she confessed that she had a few early miscarriages before they even told us she was pregnant. But she felt she had to keep smiling through it, which made her slightly resent how I was handling my situation. I told her I was hurting and keeping my distance so she could enjoy her pregnancy. She felt bad for misunderstanding and thinking I was shutting everyone out. I assured her that this wasn’t the case; I hadn’t let anyone in, and with her being pregnant, it was tough for me. I wished her luck but told her I hoped she could understand why I didn’t think I could be there with her. She was sad but agreed.

We talked more, and by the end, things were better. I texted my family group chat with a long message about how I was feeling and why I would be taking space from meetups, because I feel I need it after this. While the apologies eased my mind and I can see myself forgiving them in the future, I am still hurting, and I think right now, I need to spend time with my husband and son and handle my grief with a professional.

Thank you all again for reading this, and I hope this answers your questions about what happened next. Hope you all have a fantastic day!",throwra_71839,10078,244,0.9800000190734864,0.4604408863126322,1736467119,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hxr5ew/update_aita_for_leaving_my_dads_birthday_dinner/,2025,1,AmItheAsshole,2025-01-09 23:58:39

1i2arp6,AITA for refusing to fund my boyfriends ‘genius’ idea?," 
I (F24) have been dating my boyfriend (M29) for 3 years, and while he’s always been a bit wacky I usually find it kind of endearing. This time however, he’s really outdone himself. A few weeks ago, he told me he had a “groundbreaking” idea that would “change humanity forever.” Entertaining him, I asked what it was. His answer? He wants to invent a new color.

Before we go any further it’s important to note we are both college graduates. I graduated in Biochemistry last year and my boyfriend in Philosophy a few years before, which makes this all the wilder I guess.

I tried to gently point out that colors exist as part of the visible spectrum of light, so unless he was about to discover some new wavelength, this might not be possible. But he waved me off, calling me “close-minded” and saying he was “enlightened in a way you’ll never be”

At first, I just nodded and let him ramble about his “vision.” But then he told me he needed funding to start his “research.” Specifically, he wanted me to give him $4,000 so he could buy “supplies,” including “advanced art tools,” a lab coat (because apparently, scientists wear them, so it would make him “feel smarter”), and—wait for it—a trip to the desert because he thinks the “pure sunlight” there will inspire him.

I told him absolutely not. I’m saving for grad school, and even if I weren’t, I’m not dropping thousands of dollars on his… whatever this is. He got mad, saying I didn’t believe in him or his “potential to revolutionize human perception.” He even accused me of being jealous that he had a “world-changing idea” and I didn’t. It got really heated and he ended up saying a lot of things about using my card as he knew the details anyway. For reference he’s been unemployed for a while now, whilst I’ve got a regular job. I ended up saying some things I do regret, but a lot of it was retaliation.

Now he’s sulking and telling everyone I’m “unsupportive” and “afraid of innovation.” His friends are backing him up, saying I should be encouraging his creativity instead of “crushing his dreams.” AITA for refusing to fund his quest to invent a new color?",Rich-Painter-9008,5714,1432,0.949999988079071,0.4316368553889452,1736983007,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i2arp6/aita_for_refusing_to_fund_my_boyfriends_genius/,2025,1,AmItheAsshole,2025-01-15 23:16:47
1ies40z,AITA for kicking out my mom’s boyfriend?,"When I was 17 my mom came into money.  She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad’s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister’s college and set up funds for mine.  She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house.

Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn’t pay anything but he did work.

When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn’t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it.  She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed.

Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey.

For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven’t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid.

He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for.  Until his current partner.  She’s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit.

I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom’s past relationship as an adult was pathetic.

I hollered for my mom’s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn’t know what he current thing thought but I wasn’t going to be disrespected in my house.  He wouldn’t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just “being kind” letting me stay.

First that isn’t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can.  He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn’t that’s on him.

I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn’t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week).

I really feel like my mom didn’t expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and  that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.",NotWillingToShare,8616,464,0.9800000190734864,0.4273211592294468,1738364783,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ies40z/aita_for_kicking_out_my_moms_boyfriend/,2025,1,AmItheAsshole,2025-01-31 23:06:23
1hts7rx,AITA for telling my sister that my nephew is NOT my baby? ,"My sister (23f) lives at home and has a 6 month old baby. She never moved in with her boyfriend because they live far from each other and neither of them wanted to compromise. Her baby daddy never ever comes around, he’s seen their son probably less than 30 days total of his entire life. And because of this my sister has been treating me (21f) and my mom as his other parent. She expects free childcare CONSTANTLY while she works and whatnot and gets very upset when I act hesitant about it for whatever reason. Because she doesn’t want to send him to daycare (she’d be eligible to get free childcare in our state but doesn’t trust it). 

And I love my nephew to death but these are MY child free, college years; I have been parentified and forced to play mommy for my little siblings for years, and just when they’re getting to the age that they don’t need me so much I don’t think I should be forced to step up and play mommy to another child who isn’t mine. Especially when I’m on winter break for the next couple of weeks and just want to enjoy sleeping in way too late and being lazy before I’m thrown back into full time college (this has been happening for 4 months at this point though). So when she asked if I’d watch him tomorrow I got a bit of an attitude but ultimately said yes. But to that she got snappy with me and was like “Why do you always act like you don’t want to do it?!” To which I got upset and responded “Because he’s not my kid and I shouldn’t be expected to do this all the time.” 

She got VERY angry at me and is now not talking to me at all, and is surely going to weaponize my nephew against me. And to an extent, sure I understand her anger: I know that you should be able to rely on your village and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong for not wanting to do this. But I am so tired of taking care of other people’s children all the time for free, even if I love the kids to death. I can’t tell if I’m being selfish or not, AITA here?

1hwvpht,AITAH for confronting my uncle on a $700 debt while he brags to his family about a surprise vacation to Maldives for his daughter as a Christmas present?,"Last September my uncle Daniel (43) came up to me (22) looking all stressed and asked if I could have a sit down with him as he needs a Favour. He begun to speak on how he was really on a rough financial spot, and he really had nowhere to turn to as he didn't have anyone to ask for a loan from and I was the only one left available.  Mind you I'm not rich or anything of the sort, I just happened to have the amount he needed at the time.

According to him it was a serious situation that he couldn't approach or tell other guys in the family, and the issue needed to be addressed soon. Without better judgement I lent him the cash after much insisting from him. We agreed on payment before December, and I didn't even ask for any interest on it. With lots of hugs and words, he took it and gave me his word on the paying it.

Fast forward and we are now at Christmas dinner at my grandma's house, and all that time I didn't give him any reminders or a checkup. I assumed he was late or something and he would let me know why at Christmas dinner because the larger family meets every year for that. He also didn't call or say anything to update on his situation and I just had to trust all was well. Now on a related side note for later, my cousin Aisha, (20, Daniel's daughter) recently underwent surgery a while back as she really had it tough for the whole of last year while she recovered from a traumatic back injury from an accident.

Everyone was enjoying their meal and suddenly my uncle stood up at the dinner table and called for attention for a speech. He began to speak on how his business took a really huge boost and long story short, how he has just cashed in a large profit from some deals. He looked at Aisha across the table and took out some brochure with some resort looking location and said it was a gift to her for her tough recovery from the incident. All I could see was Aisha visibly crazy excited. Someone asked what it was exactly, and Daniel said he was planning on taking Aisha and the rest of his family to the Maldives as a celebration on Aisha's accident recovery. Everyone was now happily cheering Aisha on her gift as it seemed it was something she always wanted to experience.

""You can afford all that but not repay my debt which you haven't said anything on,"" the words just slipped out of my subconscious mind as I looked at him straight in the eye. His words were ""why are you talking about that now of all places"". Now I was pissed, I reminded him Infront of everyone on the exact amount and I told him the fact on how he wasn't even communicating on repaying it. The entire family was in shock with dead silence as my mom hurriedly changed the subject to avoid an escalation of the situation. Later on, in the evening my aunt, grandma, and some cousins began to lecture me on how I ruined Aisha's moment after her struggles and embarrassed my uncle in the process.

They leave in a week, and he still hasn't paid or mention anything on the debt.

1hvao5z,AITAH for not allowing a new born at my birthday?,"I’m having a 30th birthday party. It’s ladies only and asking people not to bring SOs or kids. It’s not going to be a rager but I want it to be a fun night to let loose a little (lots of moms coming), laugh and have fun. A friend of mine just had a baby, her baby will be 1 month exactly day of party. It seems she thinks she should be able to bring her baby, however I am leaning towards sticking to my request of no children, which means she won’t be able to come. From what I hear, she’s upset and doesn’t think this is fair.  She wants to bring her baby. Now this may be selfish but I know that bringing the baby will impact the “vibes” of the party. The focus will be on the baby instead of enjoying our time together. I know that no one else there will obviously be offended or anything like that. I too am a mom, if I was in her shoes I would just not go and leave it at that NBD. And if I’m being really honest I want this day to be about my birthday, not her baby 😬😬. I do feel guilty, but I’m a people pleaser. Also I want to add if the roles were reversed, she would 100% ask people not to bring babies as well. She’s actually done this in the past.

1hxnbq2,AITA for not cleaning my sister in law after she got sick drunk. ,"Between Christmas and New Years, me (43m) and my wife (43f) went to hang out and drink at my sister in laws (32f) house while her husband (wife's brother) and son went away for a few nights. Basically a normal night, my wife and I went over to keep my sil company. Played board games, drank etc.... My sil is very proper, fashionable, basic white girl. Maybe 5'2 and 100lbs. Anyhoo, we're in the living room, my wife passes out on the couch so we decide to call it a night sleeping on the couch. My sil gets up to go to bed, a little wobbly but she goes into the bathroom and shuts the door. I play on my phone for about 45 minutes and I notice she's still in the bathroom. So I knock on the door with no response, I knock a few more times then open the door to look in. She's a naked pooper, she passed out while pooping apparently and fell off the toilet onto the floor. Somewhere in all that she puked all over herself. So I'm left with a completely naked woman covered in puke, poop and pee. I try to wake my wife up but she's out cold, I try to wake my sil up but she's out cold. So I grab a bunch of towels, just do a quick clean up. Get the heavy stuff off of her, clean up the floor and made her a bed of towels so she didn't have to sleep on the cold tile, propped her head on a folded towel as a pillow and used a giant fluffy towel as a blanket. 

Here's why I'm told I'm an asshole. She was mad I let her lay in poop/puke all night. I should have picked her up and put her in the tub and bathed her. She was passed out drunk, I didn't think she wanted me touching her intimate areas. Where she replied that I have a wife and daughter, I've seen a vagina before and I've changed my daughter's diapers/baths so I know how to clean a vagina/butt/breast. She's only 100lbs so it would have been easy for me. My wife sides with me but the other women say that I should have cleaned her better. So am I an asshole? Would you want someone touching you while you're passed out?

1i983ij,AITA for accepting an invitation on my husband’s behalf that I knew he wouldn’t like and refusing to cancel it?,"My husband is a busy person but he’s not such a busy person that he can’t manage invitations from his family and friends if he wanted to. His family and friends act like I’m responsible for his social calendar, which I didn’t mind at first because I didn’t have anything better to do but I’m tired of being the one to have to say no to everything and it sucks having to deal with people trying to convince me to come to things when I know they only really care about my husband attending.

I’ve tried to get them to go to him directly but he just sends them back my way or ignores them so they come to me anyway. I’ve spoken to him multiple times about not wanting to be responsible for ‘our’ social calendar and he acts like he gets it but then never responds to invites so nothing’s changed.

So I’ve done something that you guys may or may not think is petty. My mother-in-law has asked for us to join monthly family dinners with her side of the family. I prefer her side of my husband’s family but my husband is closer to his dad’s side so we see them more. Usually, I wouldn’t accept an invite like this without checking with my husband but since she asked him first and he ignored her I decided to accept on his behalf.

The first dinner is on Sunday which is the day we were also supposed to have dinner with his grandfather on his dad’s side but he never told me that was happening and neither did anyone else (his dad’s side have a horrible habit of just assuming we’ll be at something because they’ve told us). Part of me thinks the dinner with his grandfather is a lie because I know he’s been avoiding his half-brother like the plague since he keeps asking him for an investment and his stepsiblings will be there.

My husband told me to cancel but I don’t want to because my mother-in-law was so happy when I said yes. Also, his sister will be there and I haven’t seen her in forever. I won’t stop him from cancelling if he really wants to but he’s turned this situation into a fight because I didn’t ask him first and now I don’t want to be the one to cancel. He’s basically said if we go to the first one he expects me to tell my mother-in-law this won’t be a regular thing but I think he should be the one to do that since I have no problem having dinner with them regularly.

As a joke, obviously. It was supposed to be unserious and stupid but Carly gave me a weird look. She said that's a weird thing to say. I was taken aback because she's seen me make much more weirder jokes than that and I had no idea why she was hung up on this one.

She scoffed and just kept watching.

I didn't know this joke could be insensitive. I mean, I know it's kind of a stupid joke, but I didn't know it could offend like that. She's not even British! So I'm doubting myself on whether this was offensive or not.

1hts6wj,AITA for refusing to watch my neighbor’s kid before school because she kept nagging me?,"I F35 am a stay at home mom with two kids “John” M10 and “Ava” F8. My neighbor “Zoe” F42 works full time and asked at the beginning of the school year if she could drop off her daughter “Sue” F9 an hour before school started twice a week. I agreed and was happy to help out a neighbor. However, things got bad pretty quickly.

My kids do not get along well with Sue and see entertaining her as a chore. Both of my kids enjoy sports, arts, and playing outside, while Sue is glued to her phone. Despite this, Sue pouts when my kids do their own thing instead of trying to engage her. Zoe called me a few weeks into the school year to nag me for having the kids walk/bike to school, saying it was unsafe and asking me to drive Sue. I told her no–if Sue was old enough to have a phone she was old enough to walk/bike to school. A week later, she asked me to cook real sausage for Sue in addition to veggie sausage I make for my kids (my husband and I don’t buy meat). I told her no–Sue could eat what I cook but if she wanted specific food she would have to prepare it herself. 

For the first semester of school, Zoe nagged me with similar requests. Don’t play songs with explicit lyrics, don’t let multiple kids on the trampoline simultaneously, watch the kids when they’re outside, etc. When I refused, she was respectful and would be like “sorry to bother you” but she still had new requests every week. At the end of the semester, I told her I was not going to make adjustments to our family lifestyle and inconvenience my family for the sake of her child. Sue’s safety was not at risk. If she was unsatisfied with Sue’s situation, there were plenty of other people in the neighborhood who could watch her. Zoe seemed really receptive, and I was hopeful that would be the end of her nagging.

When my kids got home on December 20th, I asked, “Are you excited for 2.5 weeks with no school?” and John responded “I’m more excited for 2.5 weeks with no Sue.” Ava nodded and giggled along. It broke my heart to know that they were more happy to get a break from Sue than school.

Just a couple of days ago, Zoe reached out to me thanking me for agreeing to watch Sue and asking if I could watch her a couple afternoons a week in addition so Zoe could have some “me” time. I told her this would no longer work–our kids did not mesh well and I didn’t want to deal with more inappropriate requests. 

I thought Zoe might be mad, but instead she just begged me to watch Sue at least one morning a week. She apologized profusely and said I could parent however I wanted to. This made me feel bad because she genuinely needed my help and did not know what she would do. I told her I knew I could and that her apology was too little too late.

My husband and kids stand by my decision, but some of the other moms think I should have been more accommodating, saying I’m selfish, that moms help moms and I’ll never know when I might need help. Does my refusal to help Zoe make me an asshole?

Update: Thank you for the responses. It was so validating to see that you support my actions. The moms in my neighborhood didn’t, but at least a few hundred strangers on the internet did. I want to address some common comments and hopefully provide reasoning as to why I initially agreed to help Zoe. In addition, there are some new developments I’d like to share

First, I want to give background. This shouldn’t change the verdict, but hopefully it makes you think I’m less of a doormat. Zoe is married but her husband works in a city 2 hours away and is hardly ever home, and Zoe herself works a demanding job with weird hours. They already pay a fortune for their nanny, so I was happy to lift some of the burden. She did not pay me. This may sound snobbish but my husband makes a lot of money, so an extra few dollars didn’t seem to be a huge deal. Plus, one of the things I enjoy most as a stay at home mom is getting to do these things for other families (so long as they are pleasant) and having a house full of happy kids. Not to get too personal, but I grew up in poverty with alcoholic parents. My parents struggled to put food on the table and our utilities frequently got shut off, so it was often the kindness of our neighbors that kept me fed, clothed, clean, and maybe even alive. So yeah in retrospect I shouldn’t have agreed to do so much for Zoe for free, and I have learned from my mistakes, but hopefully this can help you understand why I did it in the first place.

Now onto the story. One of the moms who is close to me “Jen” reached out asking what happened with Zoe. I thought everyone knew, but I recalled the events of the semester leading up to a couple days ago. Jen said that’s not what she heard. Zoe had told everyone that she paid me $100 an hour and that I let the kids watch R rated shows and eat candy for breakfast and I called her a “stuck up bitch” when she asked me not to. She told them my kids bullied Sue so relentlessly that she came home crying every day she came to my house, and that I encouraged said bullying. When Zoe complained about this to me, I supposedly denied it. To top it off, I demanded Zoe pay me $200 an hour or I would stop watching her “little brat.” I was horrified that Zoe was spreading this misinformation about me. I assured Jen that none of it was true, showing her receipts of my text exchanges with Zoe. Jen told me she believed me and promised to help me set the record straight. I just don’t know what to do because none of the moms will talk to me and all of the playdates John and Ava had scheduled were cancelled. I worry because even if we can convince everyone that Zoe is a liar, people will still be suspicious of me. My family has only lived in this town for a couple of years and Zoe’s family has lived here much much longer. I can take my reputation being tarnished, but I worry especially for my kids. I don’t want their friendships to be ruined by some girl who can’t accept my decision to not provide free childcare.",friendlyneighbor154,4654,440,0.9700000286102296,0.2557901225801871,1736035004,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hts6wj/aita_for_refusing_to_watch_my_neighbors_kid/,2025,1,AmItheAsshole,2025-01-04 23:56:44
1id7hka,AITAH for calling out My Uncle in front of everyone After making weird comments on my girlfriend's looks and being too touchy?,"So basically, at a family barbecue last weekend, my uncle (mid-50s) kept making creepy comments about my girlfriend Kate(21F) who I invited. At first, it was backhanded compliments like, *""Wow, you’re way too pretty for him,""* but then it got worse-*""I would have snatched you up back in the day,""* and *""Must be a struggle to compromise for me?""* He even joked about how my girlfriend must get hit on all the time and how I should *""keep an eye on her.""*

On top of that, he was being *way* too touchy, putting his hand on her lower back, touching her arm when he laughed, and even leaning in way too close while talking to her. My girlfriend was clearly uncomfortable but tried to brush it off. She told me privately that it made her uncomfortable, 

I confronted him in front of everyone, straight-up calling him a creep and telling him to knock it off in a loud way. He got defensive, saying he was just joking, and my mom told me I was out of line for embarrassing him like that. 

Some family members agreed with me, but others think I overreacted and should've handled it privately since everyone knows him as a joker and just loves making conversation which he is good at. Some male cousins of mine are insinuating I was jealous and exaggerating stuff because my uncle talked to their partners too and they didn't have any complaints like Kate.

My Uncle said he was just making jokes, and he didn't mean any of them, and he is really disappointed that I looked at him as that kind of guy

1i97bii,AITA - I rejected my BIL's child being a flower girl,"I (27F) am getting married this spring to my boyfriend (26M).
We have been planning our wedding for 2 years now and have been trying to get blessings from both sides of our families but only my family was supportive of our decision to get married.
While receiving racist remarks from my to-be in-laws, they disapproved of us getting married and wanted us to wait a while before settling down.

Since we weren't receiving full support, we decided to plan the wedding ourselves and finalized the details like date, venue, catering, etc. We are not and have not asked for any financial support and they have not asked if we need help in any aspect of the planning. I also asked a family friend's daughter (4F) to be the flower girl after the engagement and her mom agreed.

Fast forward about a year since the flower girl was confirmed: My boyfriend's older brother and his wife recently gave birth to a baby girl (let's call her Amy) and they have been badgering us about allowing their baby (will be 11MO by the time of the wedding), my fiancé's niece, be the flower girl.

My boyfriend and I pointed out that Amy isn't guaranteed to be able to walk by that time, and Amy's father responded by saying that he could carry her down the aisle. When we initially said 'no' to that idea (as I think it's weird giving the role of a flower girl to a child that wont be physically able to do any of the normal flower girl duties and it would look ugly having a toddler walk down next to an adult holding a baby), Amy's father and Amy's grandmother kept on badgering us with the same questions:

""Can Amy be the flower girl?""

1icg6ll,AITA for making my husband leave work to return my keys,"I feel so awful about this, but my husband has a habit of forgetting/ignoring things I say. I WFH and am always there to unlock the front door for my husband when he gets back from work, so the couple of times I’ve needed the car, I get very annoyed that he’s taken the house keys attached to the car keys with him. 
This has happened a few times, he’ll lock all the house doors in the morning and go off to work with the car keys so I can neither leave the house nor drive anywhere. 
So I made sure we have two sets of keys and the second pair must always be on the console table for emergencies. The problem is my husband started keeping the emergency keys in his work bag and if he took the car anywhere, I was again locked in the house. This recently happened again when my family was coming over and they stood at a locked door while I searched the house for his work bag. 
Today I woke up very unwell and wanted to run to the chemist between meetings and pick up a book I had on hold at the library, when once again, my husband has taken the car keys. What made me so angry was that I’ve told him this a million times and I could have had a massive emergency. He was so calm and apologetic on the phone and but that just made me angrier. I’m sick of him never listening.  
So I lost it and demanded he come home immediately and drop the keys back because I need to go to the chemist. He started apologising and saying he has a meeting at work about to start, but I told him this is not a discussion and I expect him back home right now because I’m sick of repeating myself. 
He said he’s on his way back but I feel so awful for stressing him out while he’s at work and making him take a 40 minute journey back. But I’m also so desperate to be heard the first damn time, exactly how I listen and respect his wishes. Am I an asshole?

1id8czv,AITA for lashing out at my coaches assistant for making a joke about my dad who recently passed?,"So I 16M, was at swim practice earlier today (6:30-8:30PM) and this is one of my first practices back after my dad passed in early December. 

Anyways, I come in and get changed as usual, and then I get showered and head out to the pool deck. Keep in mind, I have gained a bit of weight since the last time they have seen me and I’m quite out of shape and struggling to keep up when we start the practice. My coach says welcome back and hugs me and stuff and he basically catches me up on everything that’s happened, what I’ve missed, etc. Then we start the warm up, it was quite difficult for me as I haven’t swam in almost 2 months. To begin the warm up, we had to dive off the blocks, my dive was really slow and sloppy as I haven’t practiced for a while.

We get out of the water for the coach to explain the main set and the coaches assistant (I think she’s 38F but idk for sure) says “it’s a pity your dad couldn’t have died a little later to save you from this practice” and she starts laughing and I’m fuming at this point. I tell her to PO and to not talk about things like that and I left early. My mum has called the coach and told him that what was said today was unacceptable, and that she thinks it’s disgusting that an adult who I should view as an authority figure to trust and look up to would say such things.

1ias7f1,AITA for wanting my boyfriend’s kid to work or go to school?,"My boyfriend’s son is 18, he’ll be 19 in May and graduated from HS last spring.  He didn’t get a semi- FT job until the middle of July.  He was working very minimally at a restaurant. I didn’t make a big deal about it, because I figured he was taking a “break” after HS.  So, he got the semi-FT job at this landscaping company in the middle of July.  Everything was going well until fall.  He decided not to go to technical school or college.  Well, school isn’t for everyone.  The problem I have is that since the end of October, he hasn’t been working hardly at all.  We live in the Midwest, so there is no lawn mowing or landscaping after October.  So, right now he is working even less hours at the restaurant and maybe shovels snow and snow blows once or twice a month.  In the meantime he is laying around playing video games, hanging out with friends and basically being lazy.  My boyfriend does not charge him rent or utilities and allows this behavior.  We have four other kids besides him and could use his bedroom.  I believe that he should be paying around $200-$300 for rent if he is not going to school and for that matter not really working.

1i64gwn,AITA for telling my sister not to bother coming to my wedding?,"I (24M) excluded my sister (28F) from my wedding but not my other sister (26F) and upset my entire family. 

I am getting married to a really wonderful man we’ll call Max (26) this summer but my sister will not be in my wedding party. Here’s why:

I have two sisters, Macy and Penny. We grew up close— but with no brothers I felt excluded. My sisters would go on ‘girls trips’ and I wasn’t invited. My father isn’t in the picture, so mostly mom would leave me with grandma. Sisters and brothers are different: Penny and Macy fight, but they always make up.

 Penny is a lesbian and as a gay man we’ve bonded more as adults. Overall I love both my sisters even if the relationships are painful.  

About seven years ago, Macy married her fiance Michael. Penny was her maid of honor and Michael asked me to be a groomsman. Her wedding party included our female cousin, but also Penny’s partner Joanne (26F). Max and I were together but he was not in the wedding. I barely knew Michael and all his groomsmen were strangers. I told my sister that I would rather support her on her wedding day, but she said that “isn’t the way things are done.” She was right, but I saw no reason why it needed to be gendered. I should have stood with my family. 

She was the bride, so I didn’t bother her about it again. 

I was excluded from everything leading up to the wedding. I missed the bridal parties, dress selection, and bachelorette activities, not to mention the fact that day I had to leave my house and get ready at her fiancée’s hotel because she didn’t want any men around while she was getting ready.

Two years later Penny married Joanne. Of course Macy was the maid of honor but I also got to be a ‘brides man’ and was with her every step of the way. Partners were excluded on both sides. 

Before the wedding, Macy kept making snide remarks about how I didn’t belong there. There were no “bachelor parties” but I think Macy thought without a groom men shouldn’t be in the wedding. I WAS invited to Penny’s bachelorette party much to Macy’s chagrin. 

Now Max and I are marrying and we weren’t going to have a wedding party— but Max insisted because he’s close to his brother Marshall. When I made Penny my maid-of-honor Macy was offended. When I told her that she was going to stand with Max and Marshall because my best friend Kohl is going to be in it, she was furious! 

Macy said she needed to be there for her “baby brother’s big day” and felt slighted. I told her that if I had to stand with strangers, she had to. Besides, we needed even numbers

My mother took her side when she complained and even my grandmother called me spiteful. Angry, I shouted that if Macy had a problem she needn’t come. Should I relent and let her stand with me? I feel like this is a total double-standard because when Macy was married the answer was “it’s her wedding.” Am I the asshole?

1i5ac68,AITA for asking my bf to wash his sheets before I stay over,"Ok so here’s the situation: 

By bf and I have been dative for 9 months and our relationship is thriving, except for this one thing. First to give a little background, my bf works as a landscaper and he is pretty dirty when he gets back from work. For some reason he doesn’t like to shower when he gets home and usually takes a shower in the morning before he goes to work (take note I said before). Anyways, the first few times that I stayed over I noticed that his sheets were kind of brownish and I kept feeling what seemed like gravel or pebbles on my skin while I slept. 

Additionally I don’t think that he washes his sheets frequently in the first place, so they just kind of build up grime and dirt. I wasn’t too sure how to approach the situation… I didn’t want to tell him to shower because that felt rude or like I was insulting his hygiene, so instead I asked him if I could wash his sheets for him. 

I kind of thought that he would get the message after that, but he didn’t. So last week I texted him and asked if he could do a load of laundry and put his sheets in there before I came over. He responded with:

“K this is getting weird, if you think that my bed is so dirty you can just come over and do it yourself”

Anyways I don’t really want to have to be his mom or whatever and wash his sheets for him all the time just so that I don’t have to sleep with rocks exfoliating me while I sleep, but I also don’t want to tell him to go and shower cause that’s rude asf, especially if I have to tell him every goddamn day.

1i97e0f,AITA for how I called out my wife’s behavior?,"I’m (28M) having a fight with my wife (28F) about a work incident.

For context, we’re college sweethearts going on 5 years of marriage. We have a daughter (3F). I always felt we were a good team.

My wife’s an attending physician who previously was the Chief Resident at her hospital. She’s a consummate pro but has zero bedside manner.

She’s currently under investigation for creating a toxic work environment. There are multiple HR reports. The complaints are adding up.

It blew up after she treated a patient and their son harshly and with condescension.

She was supervising a couple of residents while also examining a patient who kept questioning her about the necessity of a lab test. My wife didn’t take it kindly.

She asked for everyone who went to med school to raise their hand. When neither the patient nor their son did, she declared, “Anyone whose hand isn’t raised can stop talking.”

The son spoke up, but my wife told him she’s not here to be liked, and as soon as she’s done helping his mom, they won’t have to see her again.

They reported my wife. It’s the latest in a long line, and someone on her staff confirmed the complaint.

The hospital’s new Chief Medical Officer has made it clear he’s tasked with changing the hospital’s culture and that arrogance and indifferent bedside manner will no longer be tolerated. He told my wife he’s not debating with her.

I found out what happened when we were talking about our day. I expressed that I didn’t agree with what she did. You can’t talk to people any way you want.

She said patients Google search, then believe they can self-diagnose. She doesn’t care about patient satisfaction surveys and prefers to tally the outcomes of her work.

She feels that as her husband, my full support should be with her. I told her I do support her, but the reports aren’t baseless, and there are times she shuts herself down emotionally and comes across as cold.

She said, “Great, now you think I’m a bitch too.” I tried telling her I would never think that of her, but she was done talking with me.

I didn’t mean it that way. I was just trying to convey how it might be for others. Sometimes she’s unapproachable, and it can be intimidating.

I don’t condone her actions that led to the reports, but I believe she means well. There’s a whole other side of her not many see outside of me. Even with our daughter, she’s more closed off. She has a softer and very compassionate side.

I’ve seen how much she cares about her patients. She’s up late countless nights researching nonstop to ensure they’re getting the best care and making sure her staff are vigilant.

I think she snaps because she does care deeply, but she won’t admit it, so she covers.

This new CMO isn’t messing around. Being a great physician isn’t enough to protect her anymore.

This whole thing is a mess. Now I’m in a fight with my wife, and it’s not fun feeling. Communication is failing.

I had the best intentions in saying what I did, but after my wife’s strong reaction, I’m not sure anymore.

1i7lxmq,AITA my asking a bridesmaid to choose a different dress for my wedding?,"I 33F am greeting married in March. It's gonna be an indoor ceremony with about a hundred people. It is decided that all the bridesmaids will preferably wear the same dress and if that's not possible everyone will wear the dress in the same color. 

I have a total of seven bridesmaids. My husband also has seven groomsmen. 
We went to one of the bridal stores to pick out their dresses. After looking at all the colors and considering the choice of flowers for the ceremony, we decided lavender was the perfect color for the bridesmaid dresses. 

One of the bridesmaids is plus size. She picked out a cute dress but it was low cut in the chest area. And since she is big in the chest area, the dress was very revealing on her and in my opinion showed way too much of her cleavage. 

Now my in-laws and their family are very conservative people. It's no way my right to tell people on how to dress but I felt that if she wore that dress on my wedding, she would have drawn unnecessary attention towards her and I did not want any kind of drama on my wedding. 

I politely conveyed my concerns to her and asked her to pick out another dress. This is when she got furious. She pointed out that many of the other bridesmaids are getting a similar dress with a deep neckline. She accused me of fat shaming her and singling her out due to her being heavy in the chest area which is not her fault. She did not get that dress but now isn't talking to me and has threatened to pull out of the wedding altogether. 

I truly didn't want to hurt her feelings but I feel my concerns are valid as well. 

AITA?

1i8g3sp,AITA for not paying for my fiancé’s mom’s funeral?,"!Small update! Thank you everyone for all your comments! They really opened my eyes. No plans are set in stone at the moment that was just the estimate they gave him for the service. After talking to him tonight and explaining that I will NOT be footing the bill for any sort of big expensive funeral, he left the apartment, after a long argument, to stay with his grandmother and basically hasn’t spoke to me since. We don’t have any combined finances/accounts so at this point I’m just over it and he can stay gone for all I care. 

New to Reddit so forgive me for any formatting issues. To make a long story short my (31) fiancé's (35) mother recently passed. She was never really in his life (abandoned him at birth) and l've only met her one time in the 8 years we've been together. Recently she had come back into his life and they were on civil terms. We got news from the hospital that she had died and they immediately wanted to know what funeral home we wanted to send her to and of course my fiancé decides he's obligated to figure all of this out since his other siblings are MIA or incarcerated. I recommended to him we just do something simple and keep it on the cheaper side since no one else will be helping financially and he doesn't have any savings either she also didn't have any kind of life/burial insurance. Well today he surprises me after work with a 10k bill that he expects me to pay the majority of out of my savings because he can't afford it. I will admit I did help pay for his dad's cremation multiple years ago but it wasn't near the cost of what he's wanting to do now. We just recently moved into a more expensive apartment and at this point a 10 thousand dollar funeral is just not on the table but he won't budge.

1i1gqln,AITA for not hiding Tampon Trash at work,"I started my period earlier today while at work. No big deal, I put in a tampon and threw the wrapper and applicator into the mostly empty, medium sized trash can (no lid) without thinking twice about it. Then I just got back to my job.

Two hours later, the only other woman on this floor came into my office and told me I had left the tampon wrapper and applicator “out in the open” and that “anyone could see that.” She also said I “need to be more discreet because it is a mixed bathroom.”

I immediately thought her comment was rude, but a friend pointed out she might have thought she was helping by letting me know. Still, I don’t think there’s any need to hide perfectly normal trash. If it were an actual used tampon, I would wrap it for sanitary and smell reasons, but this was just small bits of plastic in the trash can. I grew up in a house full of sisters, and my fiancé is very chill about menstruation. I’ve heard of men being weird about periods, but I’ve never personally experienced it.

Another friend suggested I go to HR to make a statement and verify what’s expected, but I feel like that’s over the top. I’m more inclined to just fume about it for the rest of the day and move on without changing how I throw away things.

TLDR: I don’t hid my tampon wrapper and applicator in trash at work. ",Olive___Oil,1438,509,0.9300000071525574,0.1282232569923637,1736889500,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i1gqln/aita_for_not_hiding_tampon_trash_at_work/,2025,1,AmItheAsshole,2025-01-14 21:18:20
1huj9e2,Update - AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding?,"My husband and I just recently celebrated our first anniversary, and I was thinking about all the dress code drama when I remembered this account and thought it would be fun to give y'all a little one-year update!

After I made my original post, my husband and I decided to contact my sister and parents and have a sit-down discussion about the situation. He offered to take everyone out to eat, and we had this really long discussion about my sister and my relationship.

My sister said she made a promise to herself never to let that happen again, and that if I wanted her in my life, I needed to be a normal person. My husband told her that if she was going to keep humiliating me for something I did as a child, then she wasn't a normal person either. It became a bit chaotic. My dad took our side, and said my sister's taking things too far. My mom took my sister's side, and said that, since I have NPD, I'm not capable of real change and if they ever give in at all they'll be hurting my sister. It ended with my sister calling my father an enabler and threatening to cut him of. It wasn't a great dinner overall.

What surprised me is my sister's husband. She called me the next day at his recommendation, and we talked for a long time. She told me that she doesn't want to feel like ""a side character in the (my name) show,"" and that was how it was for all our childhoods. I told her that I feel like I'm not allowed to have meaningful relationships with any of our family, since she restricts what I say and do and wear around them. I pointed out that she controls my clothes for like every family event, and this is my wedding, and she admitted that was a good point. Eventually, she agreed to attend the wedding in a really cute black and white checkerboard dress and leave if it became too much.

The wedding itself was incredible. It was the second-best day of my life so far and my sister said she was genuinely happy for me. I felt like a princess in a fairytale the whole day, and my husband was the handsomest prince in the universe. The whole thing was under the stars, it was perfect. I could talk about it forever, but character limits. As a wedding gift, my sister told me that she was going to start letting me wear what I liked at family gatherings, and talk about my accomplishments, AND talk about myself when it's just me and her a little. And she has, and it's been great. The only better gift I got that night was my husband himself.

This past year has been the best of my life, and I genuinely feel so much better about life and family these days. I'm a girlmom now, and I'm so glad my daughter gets to know her aunt and cousins too. I'm even allowed to babysit for my sister sometimes!

1ice5im,AITAH for moving out of my boyfriends over salsa?,"Hey guys! So I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years and he's absolutely wonderful. We're both in college and we live together with a couple other roommates. The place is my boyfriend's mom's vacation house and we all pitch in for rent. Every week my boyfriends mom stops by. I work at a restaurant so I always get free chips and salsa to take home. My boyfriend loves spicy things so I always grab him spicy salsa and I'll grab myself regular as I can't handle spice. 

Now here's where it gets weird.. I've been coming home and go to grab my salsa and I notice that all of the salsa has been put into one container. This has been happening for MONTHS and results in me being unable to eat it. After asking everyone in the house including my boyfriend ""who's been doing this"" everyone was in denial about it. 

Just a couple weeks ago I decided to get a security camera to see who's been messing with me and my salsa. Guess who is on the camera mixing the salsas together? HIS MOTHER. So she's been showing up while everyone is gone, looking through our fridge and pulling out all sorts of items and going into our cabinet and getting a bigger container and putting the salsa together. I was not okay. 

For the longest time I've been thinking it was my boyfriend messing with me, needless to say after accusing him for a long time, this led to a huge argument about how weird his mother is for coming into our space and messing with our stuff. 

She does this every time she comes over and I've had enough. So I told my boyfriend to figure out why she's doing this. He calls her and she says she's making space in our fridge and she is not going to stop. So I'm now sitting here with all of my stuff packed and ready to get the heck out of here but my boyfriend says I'm being an ass about all of this 

guys, please tell me if im the ass here. ",Eternal_Sunshine333,1410,356,0.949999988079071,0.1068593372450549,1738102940,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ice5im/aitah_for_moving_out_of_my_boyfriends_over_salsa/,2025,1,AmItheAsshole,2025-01-28 22:22:20
1ht0lj8,AITA wife wants me to choose her over my friends,"So recently my friends brought up the idea to go skiing and we were thinking about going to Europe since lift passes are somewhat cheaper over there. I brought up the idea of my wife coming along and then later they decided it was going to be a boys trip. I let her know of this and she immediately got angry. She said that she really wanted to go and its not fair and that she would spend an equal amount of money on trip for herself. She also said that her feelings were hurt. I said I was sorry and I advocated for her to come but I Ultimately cant invite her to a group event that they wanted to be just the guys.

 After she was done guilting me for still wanting to go I just said that I didnt want to go anymore. this has happened on multiple occasions where my friends have wanted things to be just us and no significant others and she gets upset. I told he I didnt like how she puts me in a position where it seems like I have to choose between her and my friends. She said that I should put her as number one priority over my friends which i don't think is fair. Ideally I would like to please both but sometimes obviously that cant happen. 

  
she has now threatened to not come home after work to even talk about it. I feel like she is being childish and its not fair for me to have to prioritize her over my friends I should be able to compromise and try and make both parties happy as each are important to me.



So AITA for wanting to compromise between the two and being angry that my wife puts me in an ultimatum between her and my friends?",Ok_Shock5553,57,780,0.5400000214576721,0.1052703348201318,1735947589,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ht0lj8/aita_wife_wants_me_to_choose_her_over_my_friends/,2025,1,AmItheAsshole,2025-01-03 23:39:49
1i31gj7,AITA for expecting my stay at home husband to do the stay at home duties?,"This is my first time posting so sorry for any mistakes. My husband ""Jack"" (33M) and I (28F) have a toddler together and have another one on the way. He's a stay at home and I work full time. I'm out of the house the majorty of the day while he's home with the toddler. 

Jack doesn't do anything. He never sets an alarm to get up with the toddler. I do. He sits in the living room until our toddler's nap (which varies every day) then goes to the basement to play his video games. Our toddler will sleep anywhere from 2 to 3 hours. Then once our toddler wakes up, he gets her, makes dinner, and maybe gets one chore done around the house. Almost every day he does this. There are some days when I'm pleasantly surprised. 

I've talked to Jack multiple times about keeping the house cleaned, but he claims it's not fair that I don't have to do anything (which isn't true). If the house is kept up on, I do dishes, laundry, and meal prep on my days off. Sometimes I'll bake too. I'll also be on toddler duty. However once he lets the house go, I don't do anything other than clean the areas my toddler is in so she's not affected by it because she deserves a clean house. 

I have (almost) gotten the house completely cleaned 3 times now, and he lets the house go. I've tried splitting chores, but again, it's hard when I work full time and I'm out of the house the majorty of the day. My job has me on my feet all day and some days are harder than others.
 
I tell Jack all the time (and have proven it sometimes) that if the roles were reversed, I'd have the house cleaned for him. Jack claims that's not true. He claims it's my fault that the house is trashed because I should do more, yet I work full time because he didn't want to work, which I supported and made more sense financially. I have also been really tired and just want to sleep due to my pregnancy, but Jack gets mad if I don't wake up in the morning, even though I let him sleep in most mornings.

I know how Reddit can be, which is why I didn't want to post, but I'm at my wits end. We literally had another fight about the house being trashed and instead of helping me clean like I asked, he's now working in the garage. (Jack will literally find other things to do other than clean the house. For example, if there's a task that needs to be done, he'll take all day to do it, even if it's an hour long job).

So AITA for expecting my husband to clean the house? Should I be doing more?",TheAnxiousOne12,1230,386,0.9300000071525574,0.1031658748550317,1737067124,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1i31gj7/aita_for_expecting_my_stay_at_home_husband_to_do/,2025,1,AmItheAsshole,2025-01-16 22:38:44
1i2zpkb,AITA for telling SO I dont want him to have more custody of his son,"I started dating my SO 2 yrs ago. I became pregnant with our daughter after 13 mos. After finding out we were pregnant, we bought a new house with more space. Ironically, I got laid off around the time we moved. Luckily, I found a new job. 2 mos after I gave birth, my SO purchased the home next door for his mom. He sees it as an “investment opportunity” & MIL will be there to babysit when I am at work, which I am thankful for. However, I had concerns about our privacy & about the huge life adjustment that is his mother living directly next door. I have recently returned to work—which has been hard as a FTM who is BFing, I am the primary caregiver (SO works in the medical field and isnt home that much). SO has addiction issues (alcohol). It has caused huge strain on our relationship & on me. He isnt very reliable due to the alcohol.

SO has a toddler son from a one night stand. For the duration of the kids life, he has weekly visitations on Sundays for 6 hrs. Whenever we do have him, “MIL” is present 90% of the time. Which I have justified with the fact that she doesn’t get to see him otherwise. “MIL” is all too willing to change his diapers, prepare his food, baths, play with him, etc.. SO doesn’t do any true caretaking for the son—just plays with him. BM filed a custody/child support case 15 mos ago, so the legalities of that have been unfolding simultaneously with the rest of the chaos.

The court hearing is finally happening this month. I was shocked to find out that SO is trying for 50/50 custody with everything going on, & with how little he has been involved thus far. It seems like SO only wants 50/50 to “one-up” BM because of the addiction tactic she used. He has no DUIs or legal issues so she wouldn’t be able to prove that he is unfit. That said, it seems like he would have a fair shot at 50/50. I have expressed to him that I cannot take another huge life change in this short period of time & that I need time to adjust to new job, being a new mom, having MIL move in next door, & we need to get his alcoholism under control. He has agreed to go to therapy for the drinking so hopefully we are taking steps towards his sobriety. However, I feel that until he does that, & until we can fix our fractured relationship, adding another kid into the mix is just going to exacerbate the issues we have.

In summary, AITA for not wanting custody of his son? I would be more open to it down the road, but right now I am at my wits end. I dont want to care for someone elses kid whenever he hasnt been making me feel like its worth it. If he were being a better partner to me, I could justify it more. I really think we need to fix our relationship first, after all, that is what is supposed to remain whenever the kids are grown and out of the house.

I do care about the son. I just feel like now is not the time to be asking for more custody, & it seems really inconsiderate to continue to add things to my plate when I have vocalized that I am overwhelmed.

1hyfs4u,AITA I refused to keep loaning a roommate money for dress clothes for a funeral ,"I’m 38 year old physically disabled male currently living in a group home until I can regain my mobility and independence. Over the past year of so I’ve developed a friendship with another resident who isn’t great at managing their money. I’m the type of guy who likes helping people and people go to seeking advice or at least support. Over that time I loaned him about $600. He’d make some payments but often ask for that amount back within a week. I eventually put my foot down and stopped loaning him money. 

Then one of his three daughters was killed, then the second died from an illness. I gave him more money in loans and gifts to help him with these extraordinary times. I probably loaned him about $150 and gave him $100 for travel to see his family and help with a headstone and flowers.

A week ago his last remaining daughter’s son died of COVID and I gave him another $110 loan for travel and funeral expenses but he still wants more. I’m on fixed income right now and will probably be for at least the next year and a half. I’ve basically written this money off in my mind but I feel I can’t just keep throwing money to him. Right now he wants money for dress clothes or says he won’t go to his grandsons services. It’s tearing his daughter up and it feels like the emotional blackmail he’s used against me before when he keeps telling me a true friend would help.

My family say I’m in the right cutting him off but it hurts my heart. I just need people unconnected to the situation to give me their opinion.

It's a family of 5 and our house isn't the biggest and only has 1 bathroom, so that's 7 people in the house when it was only just 2. We gave them 120 days to find to find a job and a place for themselves. They all found jobs but they couldn't find an actual place to stay so they are renting bedrooms and now upset with us. It's like they weren't even trying to find a place to stay. It seemed as if they got too comfortable. If they were looking they would have asked me for help but they asked me maybe once but that's about it. They weren't proactive about it at all and now they are mad at us.

1hw4fvn,AITA for telling my boyfriend he got to eat because I didn’t?,"
I (19f) and my boyfriend, (let’s call him K), (20m) have been together for a year and a half and living together for around 5 months. 

We’re tight on money right now (I’m the only one able to work due to my boyfriend’s disability.) and it’s been stressing me out. I was barely able to make rent and pay electricity, our WiFi got shut off, and I had barely any money to get groceries. 

K is also autistic and I believe (for many reasons) that he has ARFID. This is relevant, I promise. 

Having said that, K almost never find anything he wants to eat. A fair amount of the time I’m asking my mom for a little money so I can get him something he WILL eat, because if he doesn’t, his disability (not naming due to privacy reasons) will go from 0-100 very fast. 

Going into the issue that brought me here:


Last night K couldn’t find anything in the fridge he wanted so he asked his mom for $20 and I took him to Wendy’s. We couldn’t afford for us to both get a meal, so he got one and I didn’t. I ended eating a peanut butter sandwich and a couple of his leftover cheese fries that he couldn’t finish. I was a little upset, but with how routine this is for us, it didn’t hurt my feelings much. 

This morning he had pretzels and peanut butter. He was still hungry and couldn’t find anything else, so I looked at my rewards points and got him a burger from McDonalds. I got nothing because (once again) we have no money. But also; I’m hungry, I’m on my period, and I’m sick. Not the best time!

We got home, he ate, and I sat there. He didn’t say thank you, didn’t ask if I wanted any of it, nothing. So I got a little upset and he noticed and asked. 

Our conversation went as follows:

K: “You okay?”

Me: “Yeah, I’m alright. Just really hungry and we don’t have anything I can cook right now”

K: “yeah, I can second that.”

Me: “but you got to eat”

He looked at me and looked kind of angry. 


K: *silence for 5 minutes*

I looked at him and he looked upset, and I realized I might’ve been a little harsh. 

Me: “I didn’t mean to make you feel bad, I’m sorry if I made you feel that way.”

K: “well it felt like you did.”

Me: “I didn’t mean to, but at the same time, is it not true?”

And then nothing after that. He just got on his phone and stopped talking to me. 

I genuinely didn’t mean to make him feel upset or any type of way. It’s just frustrating having to be the only one working and providing for both of us and getting no acknowledgment for it. Maybe that’s egotistical of me to say, but I just want to be appreciated a little more. I don’t mind buying him food, if it’ll make him eat something I have no issue. But he shows no gratitude for the things I do for him, then when I make a point of it, this is generally how it goes. 

Rant over though, I just want a little insight on if I’m doing something wrong or if I was insensitive.

1iy5n9x,AITA for asking my GF if she can take a shower?,"My GF really only showers once a week, twice if I'm lucky.

Typically we go to the gym together, and I've often asked her why she doesn't shower, and she always comes with things like ""Oh women don't really sweat much, and I sweat very little even for women's standards"". And I don't buy it, because I can smell. I used to just suck it up, because I know she's extremely sensitive. Kinda NSFW here but, this even affected our sexlife. I used to love going down on her, but after not showering after workouts/long work days etc I've lost interest. 

Fast forward a bit. She now starts using the sauna at the gym. Maybe on average 2 times a week.  
She. Still. Refuses. To. Shower. I've said ""There's just no way you don't sweat in the sauna, just me sitting 5 minutes in there gets me soaked"". She says she doesn't sweat much there either. And she sits there for 20 minutes.

Things are now worse. I can smell her, very badly. Almost to the point where I try not to breathe in too close to her because it's not good. I've tried so long to give hints to get her to shower more, like: ""Hey do you want to take a shower together ;)?"" But she can't take the hint, and says ""Why would we do that, there's only room for 1 under the water anyway""....

One evening, she wanted to lie down on the floor, and stare at a world map she has. She invited me to lie down next to her, and just talk about where we want to go etc. I lasted for about 1 minute, before I had to make up some dumb excuse as to why I had to get up. She then get's upset and says something along the lines of ""Why are you leaving? You never do stuff with me"" The truth is just I can't be close to her for long.

I'm not even sure if I started to resent her, because it was only this one thing that was bugging me in the relationship. But maybe I did, and that's my fault for being bad at communicating to her.

Anyway, I couldn't hold it any longer. I tried one last time to ask if she wanted to take a shower with me, to show I did want to do stuff with her, but she declined. Then I said ""I know you say you don't sweat, but I can smell. I don't like the smell of sweat etc and it being a popular gym we go to, I would just appreciate if you showered a bit more"". 

She freaked out. WW3 started. She accused me of things and asked if I found her disgusting etc. It almost felt like she wanted me to think she's disgusting for some messed up reason? Like this was an easy way to create distance between us, have less sex, and all that. I'm not sure, maybe I'm overthinking it. It's just to me, it feels awfully obvious to shower if not daily, at least every other day. She said she doesn't want to shower her hair often, but still, you can shower your body. 

Our relationship is borderline over because I hurt her, so AITA? What could I have done differently?

^(Irrelevant but: Is it normal that women shower less than men? I was always under the assumption it was the opposite.)",john4844,14479,3863,0.959999978542328,0.7778758684220628,1740517106,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iy5n9x/aita_for_asking_my_gf_if_she_can_take_a_shower/,2025,2,AmItheAsshole,2025-02-25 20:58:26

She said she put the cat in its carrier and left it outside the door of a local salon before they opened. She said she checked in later, and one of the girls had decided to adopt the cat, so the re-homing was a success. 

I told her that what she did was not re-homing, and that what she had actually done was dump her cat. I told her that re-homing involves finding an owner and vetting them in advance.

1iwn9y6,AITA for telling my girlfriend I wouldn't make her coffee anymore unless she stops micromanaging me?,"So, for context, I (24M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for about two years, living together for roughly six months. Normally, we have a good routine: I wake up first, make coffee, and she wakes up to a nice hot cup. Recently, though, she started getting really particular about how she wants it done. She insists on using this super specific method: measure the grounds to the exact gram, pre-warm the mug in the microwave for 30 seconds, add the milk at a certain temperature, and on and on.

At first, I tried to oblige because hey, if she loves coffee that much, I want to make it nice for her. But it got to a point where every time I handed her a cup, she'd grill me: ***“Did you weigh the grounds first?” “Did you warm the mug?” “Is this whole milk or 2%?”*** If anything was off, even by a tiny bit, she'd sigh and say it wasn't as good as “the right way.” One morning, she literally took the mug from me, dumped it down the sink, and started the process herself—while ranting that I *never* do it the right way.

I got frustrated and told her, “If you’re going to be this picky, just make your own coffee. I’m done making something only to be told how it’s ‘wrong’ every time.” She got upset and said I was overreacting, that she just wants her coffee a certain way, and that I should respect her preferences. I argued that I *was* respecting her preference—I just didn’t appreciate the constant criticism or micromanaging. She accused me of being lazy and unaccommodating.

Now, I’m feeling guilty because I do want her to enjoy her morning coffee, but I’m also tired of feeling like I’m a barista under constant scrutiny.

1iucy76,AITA for not explicitly stating my punch is non-alcoholic?,"I (25F) recently attended a potluck-style work party, and brought punch, which has since caused a problem between myself and another coworker (42F), who we’ll call Sandy.
Last week, my boss hosted a party at his house to celebrate the end of the busy season, and a job well done. All of my coworkers and their spouses were invited, and we decided it would work well to do a potluck to offset the cost of feeding everyone (about 35 people, since not everyone who came brought a spouse or significant other). I volunteered to make a punch that I’ve brought to previous work events that everyone said they enjoyed, as well as some fruit to go with it. This was a casual party with alcohol present, but since I have some coworkers who don’t drink, I didn’t add any alcohol to this punch, and figured that if people really wanted some they’d just add it themselves. Fast forward a couple hours, and Sandy is getting even louder and more dramatic than normal, and is stumbling around the party. I didn’t think much of it and figured she brought her own drinks, or was adding some of the hosts alcohol that was put out into something else. She suddenly fell off the chair she was sitting on, and made a big show of saying that it’s because she was so drunk- she then asked me, in front of the rest of our coworkers, what it was that I put in the punch. I was confused, and told her what was in it (just a mix of gingerale, 7up, orange juice, and a can of juice concentrate), and she wanted to know what alcohol I put in it, because she’s been drinking it all night, and is “really feeling it”. I told her that I didn’t put any alcohol in it, and asked if maybe someone else had spiked the punch bowl- nobody said they added anything, and one of my coworkers who doesn’t drink even said that they’d also been drinking the punch all evening, and was still completely sober. I also would like to clarify that I understand how context can matter, like if everyone else was really drunk then that can make even a sober person feel like they’re loaded, but that definitely was not the vibe- Sandy was the only person acting “drunk”. She then got really quiet, and went by herself to the bathroom. The rest of my coworkers and I exchanged some awkward glances, and tried to laugh it off. She left shortly after, and I received an angry text from her about how I shouldn’t have embarrassed her like that, and that now she looks like an “idiot” in front of our bosses, and the rest of our coworkers. She’s been hostile to me at work ever since, and is basically refusing to talk to me. I didn’t think I did anything wrong, and most of my coworkers agree with me, but some say that I should have just let her go on thinking that the punch was alcoholic to save her the embarrassment, and I’m wondering now if I’m in the wrong.

1iowi46,AITA for telling my fiancée to stop being a brat?,"My fiancée and mom are fighting because my fiancée wanted a wedding at this lake in the mountains that she talked about before the engagement. We visited every year and it’s almost tradition to hike up there and camp there and there is more hiking past that point that we make a long weekend of it. 

My mom is not happy because she is not fit enough for the hike. Her family is because they are a hikers but my mom has knee issues and is overweight and cannot do anything too difficult. This hike is 6 km to get to the lake and everyone in the wedding party can do it. My fiancée agreed but then wanted to do it in her aunt’s backyard. Her aunt has the nicest backyard out of the people we know but I wouldn’t say it’s still very nice. She said she was just going to buy some string lights and an arch and do it there. I have been to the backyard and it’s not bad it just has garden beds and chickens in the corner which my mom isn’t happy with. My mom wants a formal location and is arguing the backyard spot is her punishing her from her first option. My fiancée denies it and says it’s because she doesn’t want to pay for a ceremony spot and she thinks the backyard is prettiest spot that is free. We looked at some public parks but they get very crowded and renting them is already not an option as they mostly filled up.

My mom found a rental spot in a building with a decorative wall and benches that cost $1200 for 2h rental and is something she felt like is pretty enough for a wedding. This is the cheapest option other than the parks we come across. My fiancée refuses to pay for it even though she agreed to half and told my mom if she wants to dictate the spot she needs to pay for it. My mom is taking it as her punishing her for not letting the wedding happen at the lake. They are arguing and I think my fiancée and I each paying for half is an easy fix and she is making it difficult for no reason. She refuses to make any compromises and told my mom if she doesn’t want the wedding at her aunt’s backyard then she doesn’t have to come. We argued about it as well and I called her a brat because it’s her way or the high way and she called me an asshole. I don’t know why this is such a huge compromise to her but AITA?

1ig8kit,AITA for not giving straight yes/no responses to my husband’s questions?,"I don’t give a non answer. I give an answer. It just might not be yes/no. It drives my husband nuts. He gets annoyed and I feel like he’s overreacting. Here are some examples:

“Do you want butter and honey on your toast?”
“I want butter and jam”

“Did you want to see a movie tonight?”
“I feel like staying in”

“Is that bill paid for?”
“I actually need to go back and look at that because they sent the wrong amount”

“Did you talk to X about Y?”
“He didn’t call me yet”

Are my types of answers really that bad? Why does he get so annoyed with these answers? (Feel free to convince me to be more sympathetic and change my answers; I just kind of think he’s being overreactive when I am clearly not avoiding the question. It’s like he wants an exact answer to the question. 

EDIT/UPDATE: A lot of people saying I do this intentionally and maliciously. I don’t. It’s a habit of how I talk and answer questions. I am aware it annoys him and I do try to adjust but I don’t always because, again, it’s a habit of talking. It can be difficult to change the way you communicate. It takes time. He also explains why it annoys him (unclear answers, sometimes ambiguous, he has a lot of vagueness at work and would just like some straightforwardness at home, sometimes lack of clarity scares him like wondering if I can’t be more direct with important situations). I understand all this and am sympathetic and do try to adjust. It just feels like a little much when he gets annoyed at something that I don’t see at that big of a deal.

1ih16sq,AITA for refusing to give back a family heirloom?,"A few years ago, my mom gave me a beautiful gold bracelet that originally belonged to my grandma. It had been passed down to my mom, and my mom told me she wanted me to have it because I was the ‘responsible one’ (I'm the oldest of her children) and would appreciate it the most. I was honored and have worn it regularly since.

Now, my younger sister (22F) is getting married, and my mom decided she wants the bracelet back so she can give it to my sister as a wedding gift. I was shocked because, as far as I knew, it belonged to me now. My mom keeps insisting that it was never meant to be ‘permanently’ mine—just in my possession until it was time to pass it on. But she never said that before.

I refused to give it back, saying that if she wanted it to go to my sister, she shouldn’t have given it to me in the first place. My sister is now upset because she thinks I’m being selfish and hoarding the bracelet out of spite.

Most of our family also thinks I'm bitter towards my sister because she's getting married, and I'm unmarried, but that's not the case at all. I'm happy for her, I just want to keep the bracelet as it was given to me first.

1ivwpqc,AITA for asking my friend to give back a gift I gave her after she openly expressed that she would be getting rid of it?,"I (27 F) have been friends with this girl (we'll call her Mary- 28 F) since high-school. Recently I was back in our hometown and she invited me to her birthday brunch to celebrate her 28th b-day. One day on my way home I happened to stumble across an estate sale where I found a set of really nice, crystal champagne glasses that were in really good condition and cheaper than their worth. Mary lives a high quality fancy lifestyle, so I thought they would be perfect for her, especially because they were within my budget (at the time I had been recovering from student loans and just put down a deposit on my first apartment in the city).

Fast forward to the brunch, we had a really good time and I got to catch up with Mary and other friends from high-school. Mary was eager to open the presents, and when she got to mine, she seemed to enjoy them, asking me where I got them since there was no label. I explained that I didn't know the brand, but the person running the estate sale had assured me that they were authentic and had been a wedding gift to the previous owners. At the mention of the estate sale, Mary became visibly disgusted. Although she didn't say anything to my face, she was very passive aggressive towards me for the rest of the afternoon. I overheard her whispering to some of the other guests about how I had the audacity to give her a used item and that she would be discarding them later.

  
After the event was over, I approached her privately, not wanting to make a scene and asked that if she wasn't going to use the glasses, if she could give them back as I would put them to good use and know their quality. She flipped out and told me it was extremely rude to ask for them back and it was not my business what she did with them.

My family is understanding and thinks that I did nothing wrong, but some mutual friends also at the event think otherwise.

1iwmrhj,AITA for embarrassing my parents in public over an allergy?,"I (19F) have been allergic to dairy since I was a baby. My doctor and parents had a whole schedule for the first year of my life to get me acclimated to dairy. It went from me throwing up every night as a baby to the point where I could eat a pretty unrestricted diet and have no real symptoms other than stomach pain when I was in middle school. 

This sounds kind of stupid lol but it took me until a couple of months ago to realise that the stomach pain is actually a symptom and not a thing I just need to deal with. I was on a school trip and asked if I could have the dairy-free meals (because I knew my stomach would feel icky from motion sickness and traveling) and I actually ended up feeling great, so ever since coming back to university I've basically gone dairy-free and my digestion has been great.  However, because I now have lost all my tolerance for dairy, even very little makes me nearly as sick as when I was a really young child. 

I've told my parents this and they basically said ""Do whatever you want at school but we didn't spend nearly two decades getting you used to dairy just to get it out now, that's a lot of time wasted."" I had to go home recently for a family event that my parents hosted and we had a big family meal with a lot of extended relatives where nearly everything had dairy. I tried scraping sauce and cheese off of stuff but I ingested some anyway clearly because I felt gross and spent a lot of time in the bathroom. 

At one point my mother got annoyed at me for leaving the table so much (I was leaving a lot) and said kind of angrily, ""Why are you being so rude at this event?"" This annoyed me because I didn't feel I was being rude, I was sick, so I said to her ""Why don't you take my allergy seriously? You're the reason I've been eating stuff that makes me sick for all my life.""

The issue is that I think that was kind of harsh of me. My parents do believe I have an allergy, they just also believe they cured it with the diet plan my doctor had me on. And they've told me that they only pursued it because my doctor said it could increase my quality of life to not have an allergy--which, to be fair, when I was on this plan I was able to digest more without getting sick, my stomach just hurt a lot. I feel like I may've been unnecessarily rude in how I reacted to my mother, and I'm also worried I drew attention to myself that wasn't needed (a lot of my relatives were asking if I was okay after dinner, which was kind of them but really not the focus of the event).

1j0isvh,AITA for asking a guest to not crochet at my bachelorette party?,"I'm (28F) getting married this year (yay!) and went on my bachelorette party trip last weekend. The trip was to a cabin-type setting where we all stayed in the same house. I have three bridesmaids, but also invited some friends to come along.

Part of the group is my brother's girlfriend (36F, brother is 38M) of five months who isn't in the wedding party. She wasn't initially invited because I don't know her well and they live in another state, but my brother asked me to invite her as a favor to him. He said that she's never been invited to a bachelorette and likely never would be (I have no idea why, this is just what he told me), and hoped she could have this experience.

Since people would be paying their own way and the group wasn't large, I figured why not. She seemed nice enough.

The problem is that during the weekend, she would insist on crocheting all the time, even during our events and games. When I asked her to participate with us, she said that she took time off for the trip, and wanted to make the most of her ""vacation"" by catching up on her crochet projects. And that playing games and hanging out with my friends wasn't ""fun"" and she didn't want to ""waste"" her days off (all her words, not mine).

To be clear, I don't care that she wants to crochet in general. Most of our activities ended after dinner anyways and we'd just hang out in the living room. I just asked her to saving the crocheting for at night after the activities.

My issue is that she was taking her crocheting with us to places like wine tasting, brunch, a museum tour, etc. It was super disrespectful in my eyes because she'd insist on coming yet wouldn't participate in the activity. Honestly, I was bothered that she was crocheting when we were playing bridal games, but at least that was in our living room!

The trips over now, but apparently she was super peeved that I asked to limit her crocheting time, and my brother's been pestering me to apologize to her for ruining her trip. I personally don't feel like I should, because she shouldn't have come to a bachelorette party if she didn't want to do bachelorette-y things!

But I also love brother very much and I don't want this to come between us. I'm starting to doubt myself because his girlfriend sounds really annoyed with me. Please help!

Edit: I wanted to add some details in case it helps, because I think some people think I'm being a bridezilla: 

1. She was crocheting a throw blanket about the width of my entire arm span. That's what she was carrying with her to dinner, museums, wineries, etc. It wasn't some small thing the size of my palm. She also had the materials for the blanket with her: about five balls of yarn? I'm not sure what you'd call it, but each ball was about the size of a cantaloupe. 

2. We gave her the option to stay home. I told her I wouldn't be offended if this trip wasn't her style and she wanted to spend it crocheting. But she insisted on coming out with us to every single event. 

3. Even though my brother asked me to bring her, she admitted to me that she wanted to come and that she had asked my brother to ask me. 

4. She's doesn't have social anxiety. She just thought our activities were boring and a waste of her time. I mentioned this in another comment, but I overheard her calling my party a ""basic bitch bachelorette"", but I didn't want to confront her because I *didn't* want to cause drama. 

5. My biggest issue isn't that she wasn't giving me attention. Please! I'm a grown adult and already thankful for the friends giving me love and joy during the weekend. I just thought it was super rude to crochet such a big project during group activities. She literally brought her blanket to a museum and crocheted *during* a private tour!",Plane-Presence9361,7341,694,0.9700000286102296,0.2307124461308629,1740778021,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1j0isvh/aita_for_asking_a_guest_to_not_crochet_at_my/,2025,2,AmItheAsshole,2025-02-28 21:27:01
1j0lkc4,AITA for refusing to go to my sisters wedding after finding out only our side of the family were having to pay to attend?,"Obligatory ""this is a throwaway account"" clarification - I'm very active in a D&D sub that I don't particularly want it to tied to this situation. 

So my younger sister (Katie 28F) and her partner (Chris 29M) are getting married in April in Dubai. She has always wanted an extravagant wedding and is going all out on this - so the wedding is happening over 4 days. Theres 70 guests but they they want us (me, my husband, and parents) to stay in the same hotel with them along with her bridesmaids (which I am MOH) and groomsmen - the hotel is pretty lux so with flights is costing us just over £2900 each. 

Chris’ family are also staying in the hotel which includes his parents, two brothers, and his nephew. 

They are well off - I don’t know exactly how much they earn combined but I know Katie is on 88k and she is the lower earner. But about 6 months ago Chris and Katie came to us and asked to borrow 17k more. They stressed it would be a loan paid over time and said the venue had increased the price, Dubai law was different blah blah blah - they paid this money or they lost the lot - we believe them and I offered to loan 7k and my parents the other 10k.

So long story short - I have since found out through someone else that the 17k wasn’t for the venue - it was for Chris’ family to fly over there. They saw how much it was going to be, didn’t want to pay and refused to go. I asked Katie and she confirmed so my first question was if they were paying for his parents why not pay for ours? (I would never expect them to pay for me - even if we couldn’t afford it, I’d have wished them well and stayed at home). And her answer was “because they can afford it”. She got very defensive and said this was the fairest way she could think of doing it, it’s hard enough planning a wedding etc - but when I asked, if you genuinely thought this was the fairest way to do it, why did you lie about what the 17k was for and say it was a venue issue? She couldn’t answer. 

My parents are aware and are very disappointed they lied - but have said they’re still attending - but I have backed out. To me it feels like my parents are being taken advantage - and if they couldn’t afford to pay for both our and Chris’ parents and his brothers and nephew then they shouldn’t have just paid for the 4 parents or no one at all. And they especially shouldn’t have lied about it. 

Katie and Chris keep calling and asking me to attend, saying I’m making them feel bad and ruining their day. But the whole thing just feels… icky to me. 

I’m genuinely and open book so be brutal - am I being an AH here? Should I just suck it up and go? 

Edit*** - Crumbs that's a lot of comments haha - thanks so much everyone. Just wanted to answer a couple of questions/comments that have come up a lot. 

1) the repayment - my husbands brother is a solicitor and he kindly drew up a contract and repayment plan for both myself and my parents so the money will be paid off within 12 months of the wedding. If they don't stick to this I have access to a free solicitor haha. I hope it wouldn't come to that - but that's why I have the papers for worst case scenario. 

2) asking for the 7K back - Imight be a soft touch, but asking for this back feels like a step too far. Like I'm mad as hell but not enough to actively try ruin their wedding a few weeks before which it feels like (right now at least) is what that would be doing. But hey - give me a few more days to stew. 

Edit 2*** 

Thanks again for all the feedback everyone. Just another quick FYI - a few people have asked about Chris' family or seem to have the impression they're well off. 

I'm obviously not privy to their financial situation, but what the limited amount I do know from what Katie has said Chris and his family gree up very poor. Before all this I'd always though Chris was a lovely guy but I had caught him in the odd but harmless white lie (things like where he went to school, the type
Of house he grew up in, etc). I get the impression he is embarrassed or resentful of his upbringing giving their lack of money and this is how he now values his own self worth - by his much money he has. 

My guess is when his family said they couldn't go he panicked and worried people who ask why they weren't there and he would either have to say they couldn't afford it or he couldn't afford to pay for them. And look his past trauma/experience is not for me to judge - but if that were the case it just makes me more mad that they both didn't plan ahead and talk to friends/family about what they could afford BEFORE booking Dubai. If it was such a dealbreaker for his family to be there they should have factored in the cost of paying for all parents to attend instead of thrusting a 3k per person bill at them and expecting them to rock up.

1inbw35,AITA for not “passing it on” at the food cart?,"I was standing in a long line at a food cart, waiting to get a popcorn refill and the gentleman ahead of me gave his order, then said, “And whatever he wants!” directing his generous smile my way. 

I immediately protested, “Sir, you don’t need to pay for mine.” But he said he wanted to, and I didn’t want it to be a thing, so I thanked him. Then he looked me in the eye and (expectantly) said “Pass it on.”

He smiled again and looked at the long line behind me before turning to get his order. I got my refill of popcorn and said thank you again and he looked so disappointed that I left instead of saying “I’ll pay for the guy behind me.” And he stopped me and seriously said ”Make sure you pass it on someday.” I repeated the words of someone I once tried to pay back: “Pay it forward- that’s what it’s all about.” I thanked him again and escaped.

But I came for the cheapest thing on the menu - popcorn is like two dollars. And there was a large family behind me. And most people were coming in big groups for alcohol. So I might have gotten free popcorn, and I appreciate the gesture, but I might then have had to shell out fifty bucks for beer for a bunch of randos.

And I’ve never liked the “pass it on” thing. It’s generous of the first person, then the last person gets a freebie, but as is often said here, all the middle people get their prices randomized and it’s a headache for the workers.

So I will pay it forward sometime, and I definitely have in the past, but I didn’t play along in the moment and I could tell the man felt his grand gesture was wasted.

1izrplx,AITA for refusing to buy my girlfriend another pair of designer shows when she barely wears the first pair?,"In 2023, my girlfriend and I went to Hawaii. At some point, we ended up in a Christian Louboutin store, and I caved—I bought her a beautiful, expensive pair of red-bottomed heels. Not the most extravagant, but still a luxury splurge.

She wore them exactly twice—once prancing around our hotel room and once at the office, where they scuffed a little. I was informed that scuffing is part of the charm (which, okay, sure). But since then? They’ve been living a comfortable, untouched life in her closet.

I’m not mad, but I do poke fun at her about it from time to time for basically keeping them hidden.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, and we’re back in Hawaii. Naturally, we visit the Louboutin store again, and now they have “everlasting” red bottoms which basically resist scuffs.

My girlfriend wants another pair. The salesman enthusiastically backs her up but I say that I'd be willing to get her another pair when she actually wear the first ones.

Now, we're not fighting, but she shares the story with all her friends. She’s been telling me I don’t get it, that luxury fashion is an investment. She insists that one pair isn’t enough because she needs a pair that won’t get scuffed so easily. I told her that sounds like she’s asking me to buy display shoes. Now she’s been giving me side-eye ever since and I'm wondering if AITA for not understanding the big picture with shoes.

So, AITA for holding my ground and not buying a second pair when the first ones are still in mint condition?

1iryg40,AITA for wearing my wrist brace at work while my coworker has a broken wrist,"
Okay so this is so weird, I (24F) work as a cashier at a sub place, and my coworker last week broke her wrist falling on the ice, so she is in a cast.

When I was 14 I was diagnosed with tendinitis in both wrists, for the most part it doesn’t flare up unless I’m doing a lot with my hands, well I’ve been doing a lot of embroidery recently and as such, have caused a flare up. 

It’s been bothering me for about two weeks and I wear my brace at home, and generally just sucked up the pain while at work, because with my coworker wearing a cast I felt weird about wearing my brace.

Well yesterday it was bad enough I had to wear it at work, as I’m putting my stuff down and getting ready to start my shift, another one of my coworkers who I’ll call Lisa, started to glare at me and asked in the usually snobby tone she uses with me “what is that for”

So I told her about my tendinitis and what it was, she then started to get huffy like I was making it up. Mind you, the coworker who has the broken wrist didn’t care, she didn’t say anything. But the rest of my shift Lisa kept giving me dirty looks, which is not out of the norm (she doesn’t like me, long story) 

Close to the end of my shift I had to use the bathroom, and being as it’s hard to do so with a wrist brace, I took it off. After coming out and washing my hands I was putting the brace back on when Lisa made another off handed comment about how I was lucky I could take mine off.

I didn’t do this to spite anyone, my wrist just hurts but now I’m getting ready for another shift and trying to decide if I should just suck it up and go without my brace at work.",Pardoned_Potato,5105,295,0.9700000286102296,0.1361561215061923,1739835355,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iryg40/aita_for_wearing_my_wrist_brace_at_work_while_my/,2025,2,AmItheAsshole,2025-02-17 23:35:55

1iqccwe,"AITA for not inviting my friend to a party, after he consistently overstays and breaks all social contracts?","Recently I had some friends over for a party at my house, and notably didn’t invite my friend “John.” I didn’t lie to him, or say that we weren’t doing it, or rub it in his face, I just had some friends over and he didn’t get the invite. 

I felt bad, but at the same time he always stays too late, makes things really uncomfortable for me, and is just a difficult guest to have in my house. I hosted a super bowl party, and he stayed roughly two hours later than everyone else, even though I straight up told him, “parties over dude.” He vapes, he says the n-word (which i don’t think anyone should say, but especially not him) and makes jokes abt some of my mental health issues. 

I love him to death and he’s one of my oldest friends, but it’s at the point where if he’s coming to my house I have anxiety the whole day leading up to it. 

Anyways, he called me during my party and asked me what I was up to, and if I wanted to catch a movie. I said I actually had a couple people over so I couldn’t tonight, and he asked who, I told him and he asked why he wasn’t invited/if he could come, and i said something along the lines of “ehh not tonight man.” He kind of lost his shit at me and sent a bunch of angry texts the next day, which is imo a huge overreaction bc i tried to be as nice as i could about things. 

so ig aitah if i just stop inviting him? 

EDIT: for everyone calling me a racist in the comments; 

some things you should know, that i should’ve included in the original post. he recently had a large personality change seemingly out of nowhere , which included some things like new music taste, excessive working out, and as of LAST WEEK saying the n word. 

i am not a racist, i do not condone racism, or his actions. he HAS NOT been invited back to my house since the first time he said that word, and will not unless he changes some things. i am not “continuing to associate with a racist,” as this is a new behavior, and my other friends feel the same way as i do. 

i should also add that i’m a senior in highschool, and still figuring myself out. ",Master_Lake9012,3270,485,0.949999988079071,0.1255317335908355,1739656094,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iqccwe/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friend_to_a_party_after/,2025,2,AmItheAsshole,2025-02-15 21:48:14
1ik6dqt,AITA for refusing to take Allergy Meds to accommodate a service dog.,"I'm hosting a birthday party for my wife at a local brewery.  I've reserved a private room with our own private bar.  I've invited friends and family.  I'm expecting about 60 people.

A cousin, who I don't know very well, has a PTSD service dog.  I have a severe allergy to dogs, cats, and horses.  I can't be in the vicinity of them without starting to feel like shit.  I did not invite that cousin.  It was quickly figured out that she was really the only family member not invited. 

It has been suggested to me that I should just take allergy meds.  I suggested that if they really wanted to come they could come without their dog.  FWIW, I don't want to take allergy meds.  I don't like them, so I don't take them.  Dogs are cute enough, but not my thing, I don't give the effort to be around them.  My refusal and subsequent suggestion has caused an uproar.  Even been called an ableist for refusing to accommodate this cousin. And seems some family members are likely not coming now.   I want to enjoy the party too.  AITA?

1iy63ei,AITA because I get up for five minutes after my fiancé and I have a meal?,"I (23F) and my fiancé (25M) have been living together for almost 2 years. In the last month or so my fiancé has adopted the habit of attempting to clean his teeth after eating by making this sucking noise constantly. It is such a disgusting noise and I can’t stand listening to it. 

For context, growing up I grew up with a grandfather that ate with his mouth open and my grandmother who had issues with her throat. Because of this, for most of my life I was subject to listening to some pretty gross noises while they ate. As an adult, I don’t want to be subject to the same experience if I don’t have to.

I’ve brought it to my fiancé’s attention several times. Every time he acknowledges it and says that he’ll try to stop, he just feels like there’s something in his teeth. I have suggested floss, toothpicks, those portable toothbrushes. Nothing has worked, he still continues to do it.

I don’t really see why I have to force myself to listen to him doing that so after we eat I’ve made it a point to get up and go sit in a different area of the house for five minutes.

We got into an argument about it and he is calling me an asshole because I shouldn’t be getting this upset about something he can’t help. Like I said, I’ve already told him several times that I’m not gonna subject myself to listening to him do that. If he’s not gonna make a more conscious effort to not do it then I’m going to remove myself from situations where I listen to him do that. 

I’m not even trying to make him feel bad or give him this ultimatum, but I don’t understand why I need to force myself to listen to him do something that genuinely makes my skin crawl just to make him feel better. It’s also important to note, it’s not like he does this just after big meals. He does this multiple times a day after eating pretty much anything.

1iti2n0,AITA for telling my dad he chose between me and his fiancé when he prioritized her surgery over mine? [UPDATE],"OG post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/YGMXJvjGhl
Hey guys, been awhile. Thanks for your love, I’ve been dragging my feet on an update but here it is. Surgery recovery has been great, I’ve been in therapy since 12, so my therapist knows everything about my dad. Can I just say it’s weird seeing my story posted on other apps with subway surfers and wood work? Love that people think my dad is a sperm donor and not a dad across all platforms.
Senior night is on Valentine’s Day which I’ve told him weeks in advance saying “games start at 7 usually but I would get at the school 30 minutes early since we will probably do it before the game.” I texted his mom(Memaw) to ask him if he was going and he texted her: “oh I never got a date, she doesn’t tell me anything” BULLSH!T! I told her I’ll go NC if he doesn’t go and I will go LC if he does go. If he wants to know? He can fvcking ask and write it in his calendar.
I told my mom to stop staying neutral and tell me why he acts like this, the relationship is almost ruined so there is no point in her trying to save it. He likes to play victim, try to make it sound like my mom doesn’t want him around, uses it as an excuse to make him look like a good guy. I’ve seen text messages when I was younger of my mom trying to get my dad to make an effort, (I showed her the first post so I’ll send her this one too, hi mom, the kindle had screenshots of some convos ily, I saw them in August when I found it so I knew for awhile). I see my mom in a new light now. She will be walking me down the aisle and my first dance, she sacrificed so much of herself for me. She is not only mom but my dad. 
For non Americans, senior night usually involves seniors and chosen people to walk them across the floor. My dad walked me down for my fall senior night, but he will not be one of my people this Friday. I am desperate to keep contact with my sister, I know Memaw will help me with that. I know that if fiancé and dad break up, he will do the same thing to my sister.
Friday came and passed, my dad got p!ssy when he realized I didn’t want him to walk me across the gym floor. He along with Memaw and my sister left during halftime. (We did the walk before the varsity game and pep band can’t leave the stands until third, same as marching band plus Memaw has been to previous basketball games along with football games). I left dad a long voice mail and message Friday for leaving especially since my sister begged to see me and he refused her. I told Memaw I was disappointed that she left when she knew what happens at games.
 Monday I finally sent him boundaries and blocked him. I know I’m going to cry later, this is going to be hard for me. Thanks for your support, it means a lot to me throughout this journey.",Normal_redditorr,4857,158,0.9700000286102296,0.1136642604689047,1740002760,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iti2n0/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_chose_between_me_and/,2025,2,AmItheAsshole,2025-02-19 22:06:00
1io3thv,AITA? Mother-In-Law invites self over during lunch and tells my partner later that she was offended we didn't share.,"I (26m) and my partner (44m) just bought a house together. We've been in the process of moving boxes and unpacking in between going to work/school/etc. Our parents respectively have been helping a lot, gifting us the things we didn't have room for in our previous too-small apartment. 

However, my parents help when I ask. They show up when I need them. They don't drop in with a ""Hey I'm coming over."" text. And they certainly don't spend hours following me around while I'm putting things away to tell me that I'm doing it wrong. Nor do they gift us a white bathmat, just to criticize the fact that I actually put it in the bathroom because ""it'll get dirty, it's white."". They also do not criticize my decor choices or spend hours scrubbing things that do not need scrubbed. They also do not tell me how to hang curtains or act like I'm too stupid to do regular handy-chores and yardwork.

You know who does? His mother. 

A few days ago, she sent that ""Hey, I'm coming over text."" right after I started cooking lunch which was annoying, but whatever. She gets there and without prompt tells me that she brought food with her. She says she's gonna have her little sandwich. And while I understand passive-aggressive boomer speak I don't entertain it. She said she had food, therefore I did not offer. 

Upon realizing she had given herself the duty of scrubbing our brand-new and clean bathroom for hours, I did, however, put on some coffee. We're all big coffee drinkers.

Of course, because I made it, it wasn't good enough. She managed to try to take coffee before it was done so it was dripping on the burner while she was pouring it. 

She stayed through lunch (10am, we have breakfast at 4:30am) clear to dinner. She even stayed when my partner left for their study group. 

While I was making dinner I was hoping she'd go home. I was tired of her appearing behind me to micro-manage my unpacking. My partner (who returned around 3pm) and I began talking about how tired we were, and how we needed to take showers, etc because asking her to leave was out of the question. Trust me, I wanted to. 

Eventually, after realizing we did not make her dinner she left. I however did not realize this was the case right away, because she was still talking about how she brought food. And given that she invited herself to do things that didn't need done, I took her word for it. She's an adult, she said she was good and that she had food. She's not an incompetent baby that I need to micro-manage. 

But yeah, she's kinda mad and my partner was agreeing saying we were bad hosts. I do not agree, I think his mom is negative and pushy. And it feels like she finds reasons to show up and be critical. I'm not entertaining this behavior.

1imjm1v,AITA for telling my ill dad to stop asking me to visit him in the hospital ?,"
I am in my mid 30’s. My parents are really old. My dad is almost 90. My mom is in her 70’s. My dad was in his mid 50’s when my parents had me. Since I was 6 years old, my dad has had major procedures in the hospital. At first it was once every 2-3 years, and within the last 15 years it’s been once a year. In the last two years, it’s been every few months.

My mom got married “later” in life. She lived her life to help her parents. I feel like because she “missed out”, she put unrealistic expectations on me. She pressured me even before I ever met my current husband to find someone and have kids. I had kids, and shortly after my youngest was born she let me know she wouldn’t be able to help me. I expected such with her age, but it was insane to me how even yet still she would ask me to have more. 

My dad has been in the hospital twice now this year for complications from congestive heart failure. My eldest is 3 and my youngest is 16 months. I am able only to see my dad for a short while in the hospital. They call me everyday to ask if I’m coming to see them. My mom sent me a text today in the middle of my work meetings saying “your dad is asking for you.”

I’ve been so exhausted from just raising kids, dealing with issues with my husband, work, cleaning house, potty training, etc. I saw the text and called her and said “why did you send the text?” She said “I’m just letting you know your dad is asking for you.” I responded “has anything changed? Is anything happening?” She said “nothing changed since yesterday” (when I last saw them). 

Is this practical, or normal ? I’m extremely overwhelmed and this is just added stress coming off as manipulation to me. My father just called me in the middle of writing this and asked me why I’m not at the hospital and I responded, in the middle of playing with my kids, “if you wanted me to be by your side all the time why did you all expect grandkids from me? Did you think that my job was just to give birth to them and abandon them once you needed me?”  I feel horrible I said this. My mom made a comment I can find a baby sitter and that she always sees advertisements for baby sitters. I told her that I can’t afford daycare and a baby sitter everyday to come see you. Then my kids will see me less than 4 hours a day.

I hate to add on this part, but — my dad has literally had everything. Heart surgery, intestinal surgery, cancer, a stroke, etc. His health is declining rapidly. But he will be in the hospital for weeks. Not only can I not afford child care to cover me for weeks — I don’t want to. I want to spend time with my kids, especially knowing that … he’s always in the hospital, and my kids are too young in my opinion not to have me for a set amount of hours a day. My mom told me I’m the a-hole for and that I should respect a dying man’s wishes — but he’s been having a dying man’s wishes for 15 years now.

1iucnv5,AITAH for being rude when my wife had a zoom meeting in my office?,"I had a medical procedure this morning/afternoon and didn’t arrive home till about 3PM. While I was gone, we had some cleaners come to our home so my wife relocated from her office to my office where the dogs were being kept. This keeps them quiet. The cleaners left at 1PM so the whole house was available for my wife to have her meetings. Let me add that my wife has a local office, but wanted to work from home today.
The medical procedure makes me very sick, and I needed my medication, which was in my office. When I got home, my wife was still in my office, even though the cleaners were long gone. She refused to even look at me and I could’ve just walked in, but I think she would have gotten angry. I took 15 minutes to do a few quick chores for my wife, came back and she was still in there.  So I stood outside my office and waited. I was there long enough that I decided to just wait in the bedroom. When I came out, my wife was very angry, and sincerely called me the asshole. 
I explained that the cleaners had been gone for hours, and my wife had the rest of the house to have this meeting. She called me an asshole again like this is my fault. I couldn’t get into my office to get my medications, but I am the bad guy. I feel that my wife has terrible WFH etiquette and because of that makes her abrasive to these types of situations. There is nothing wrong with asking the person you are meeting with for a minute to move. Or honestly just a min. for me to sneak in and grab medication bag.

1il0yux,AITA for telling my SO that her parents getting home from the airport is not my responsibility?,"We’re in the U.K., and my SO’s parents are going to Australia in November. Good for them, I’m pleased for them, however…..

The day they return I have tickets to a gig. For what it’s worth, my SO isn’t going to the gig as she doesn’t like the band in question.

Anyhow, I agreed to take her parents to the airport (she can’t drive) but told her they’d have to get their own way home when they return. 

She has told me that I’m out of order and that they expect me to collect them as I am dropping them off. 

She thinks I should give up my ticket and collect them, I think they should use the train or an Uber. 

Long and short is that my SO and more so her parents think I’m a cunt, and right now the feeling is mutual.

1isp11m,AITA for telling my MIL she can't see her grandchild until at least 6 months old?,"My MIL treated me very poorly after I had our first daughter during the pandemic. I had severe PPD and PPA and eventually I had full blown post partum psychosis. There's alot of things she said & did but her crowning moment was when I was being taken away by ambulance in full blown psychosis and she later referred to this event as a ""barrage of shit"". When i asked her to ""please not say things like that because they're hurtful & mean"" her response was ""you don't tell me how to talk"". My husband and her have a strained relationship and it's been even more strained since this. She has never offered any apology and acts as if she was justified in her actions. When I pointed out that we're all adults and we're all equal she said we weren't equal because ""shes the parent"". Anyways, Im pregnant again with our second and I don't want her around at all post partum. She caused such distress the first time around, tried to pit my husband and I against each other, tried to get my parents involved. She wasn't seeing her granddaughter as often as she wanted so she threw out toys she bought for her, sent back photos we sent of her, I could go on and on. I don't want to deal with it again and my husband REALLY doesn't want to deal with it again. We kept my current pregnancy private-ish until I was 6 months along. During a discussion with my MIL last night she told us she would be staying in town around my due date to ""help out"". We tried to politely decline but she was not taking the hint so eventually we just told her flat out we didn't want her around until baby was a bit older (atleast 6 months old) because we don't want any extra stress. She obviously reacted badly and is calling us toxic monsters (especially me) who are trying to deprive her of time with her grandchild (yet again, she said the same with the first one but reality was that i was really sick and couldn't be around a lot of people and also it was covid). Am I the asshole for holding this boundary? Part of me thinks i'm being to brash. Another part thinks back to all the chaos she caused and I feel at peace with the decision. She's not a terrible person at all, she just handled the situation so poorly that I do not want to go through it again. Husband agrees. So, am I the asshole?

1ikz8b3,AITA for calling out my aunt for lying about having a condition that I actually struggle with?,"So some background, this Aunt has a habit of copying everything anyone does and treats it like a competition. This also applies to illnesses. You mention getting ill? she is sick a day later and she always feels worse than you. Then acts like she never knew you were sick

6 months ago I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that doctors think I have been dealing with for years. The only reason they found it is because it very quickly got worse and has ruined my life. It won't shorten it, but I am in so much pain that I can't even walk to the store that is right next to my flat without feeling extreme pain and discomfort. My sleep is awful, my social life has become non existent unless people come to my place. There is no cure for it, I'm on specific targeted medications to try and stop it getting worse, the best we can do is pain management at this point and I'm on the strongest painkillers I can have but it's still bad. 

When I was first diagnosed I posted about it on my FB, not in detail, just said what I had. The only person who knows the details is my mum.

Yesterday mum picked me up so I could visit my nan. while we were there, aunt turned up. We were talking about random stuff at first but then she mentions she went to the doctors and they diagnosed her with  (condition I have) and they think she's had it for years. I thought she was lying so asked her some questions regarding it and every answer was bs. She claimed she told a doctor her symptoms and that's how they found it, when you need bloodwork done to find it. She claimed that they were looking into different procedures to cure it, which again, no cure. When I asked what meds she was on she said there wasn't any they could prescribe for it and she had paracetamol to deal with the terrible pain she was in. 

She then went on about how its affecting her life, its made things difficult for her. Yet she does martial arts 3 times a week and goes clubbing every weekend like she's a teen and posts about it on FB. I lost it. I just went off about how full of it she was and that pretending to have something so serious when I was actually going through it was pathetic attention seeking behaviour. I pointed out everything she said that proved she was lying and said the only medical help she needed was for her head as she clearly had issues. She tried to double down and say that she never knew I had it, (she saw my FB post), she thought I would be more sympathetic as I know what she's going through etc. At this point I was so mad that my mum drove me home. My aunt then later posted on FB about her 'struggles' and how some people just aren't sympathetic about this condition. I called her out in the comments of the post and mentioned what had happened earlier in the day and a load of other family started calling her out for it so she quickly deleted the post. However my cousin (her daughter) is now calling me TA as my aunt is upset I called her out.

1irxhxa,"UPDATE: AITA for refusing to help my dad's ex-wife with rent after his passing, even though she is struggling and my half-brother is still a minor?","
[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/3cv9Ud9zK2)

Over the weekend, I realized I was blocked on socials by the ex-wife and also my brother removed me as well.

I reached out to my brother directly because I wanted to make sure he knew that none of this was his fault and that I will always be there for him. I didn’t want to say anything that could damage his relationship with his mom, but I needed him to know that I did nothing against him and that he can always reach out to me.

To my relief, he responded right away and reassured me that he has no hard feelings toward me at all. He already knew that a lot of what his mom told him wasn’t true and even said he was actually happy about the decision I made. He told me that if he were in my position, he would have done the same thing.

One of the most upsetting parts of our conversation was when he admitted that he never liked asking me for money through his mom because it made him feel like a beggar, but she insisted on it. He also told me that she had been looking for an apartment way beyond her budget and had been trying to collect money from different people to afford it, which confirmed my suspicions. I also learned that now they found an apartment within whatever budget she has. 

What really broke my heart was when he said he needed to delete our messages because his mom sometimes checks his phone, and if she found out we talked, she would be very upset with him. It made me realize just how much control she has over him.

I reassured him that the money I was sending for him is still his, kept safely with me, and that when he needs anything, I will find a way to help him—but it won’t be through his mom anymore. He understood and seemed relieved. He also told me that he’s already thinking about his future carefully and wants to choose a profession where he can be financially independent, so he never has to worry about money.

Honestly, I was happily surprised by how mature and self-aware he is for a 15-year-old. Despite everything, he’s handling the situation with so much understanding and perspective, and it makes me even prouder to be his sister.

For now, I will keep in touch with him privately to make sure he knows he is not alone. I told him that when he grows up, I’ll be there to support him, especially for things like university. He knows that no matter what happens, I will always have his back.

1ivwr5u,AITA for embarrassing my sister's rude boyfriend at dinner?,"I (28F) have a good career and recently bought a house. My sister (26F) is engaged to her fiancé (30M), who I’ve never liked. At a family dinner, he made a joke about how “women like me” use men for financial stability. I asked him what he meant, and he said that because I have nice things, I must be dating rich guys.

I told him that I paid for everything myself, unlike him—who my sister supports financially. This caused a huge argument. Now my sister and parents are demanding I apologize for embarrassing him, but I refuse. AITA?

1iy8lil,WIBTA if I put a lock on my bedroom door so my GFs mother can’t sleep in our bed,"My girlfriend (F27) and I (M30) are going on holiday in a few months and her mother (F60s) and stepfather (M70s) have agreed to come and babysit our 2 cats (M1.5&F1.5). Her mother has said that they will need to use both the spare room bed and our own bed when they stay as they can’t share a queen sized spare bed for 1 week as they’ll “not be able to sleep in the same bed together all week” blaming the bed size. My GF has unhappily agreed to keep the peace but it’s making me very uncomfortable they’ll be using our bed. WIBTA if I put a lock on our bedroom door just before we go away so they can’t use it?

Extra info that may/may not be relevant: 
My girlfriend’s mother lives about 3 hours away visits every few months, but the step dad has never been before. Before we had the spare bed she would happily sleep on the quite comfortable sofa and we mainly got the spare bed for her visits. Although I know they are doing us a big favour by looking after the cats they were intending to use it as a mini holiday.

1imkjd6,AITA for refusing to walk my girlfriend home every single day?,"My (24M) girlfriend (22F) works about 25 minutes walking distance from my home. I work about 20 minutes away. My work finishes at 6PM, her work finishes at 7:30PM.

She wants me to wait for her, and then walk her home. Every single day. Because it is dangerous for a woman to walk in the streets alone at night.

While I understand there is a risk, we live in a safe neighborhood and her way home is composed entirely of avenues full of people. Also our time schedules just don't really match. I've been going home at 6PM and leaving for her work at 7:10PM but it's been very tiresome.

She even said that she broke up with her previous boyfriend because he did not want to walk her home from the gym. That this is a really important point to her and a very small compromise from me all things considered. She wants me to at the very least walk her home when I am working from home (twice per week).

Oh and she says this is part of my obligations ""as a man"".

I think her demands are unreasonable and could compromise with doing it during my WFH days, but it still feels dumb.

1iinj2v,WIBTA if I told my MIL she could no longer visit my child at daycare?,"My (29F) daughter is five months old and goes to a daycare at my husband’s (32M) workplace. My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it’s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn’t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that’s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is.


Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop visiting daycare so frequently? She comes to our house and gets to spend several hours with my daughter at least once a week so it’s not like daycare is the only time she gets to see her.

1ina65n,AITA for writing so bad my teacher couldn't read it because he didn't let me use my support?,"I (14f) live in the UK and therefore have to do my GCSEs next year. In preparation for these tests, we must do ""mini"" tests with our chosen subjects before. I also happen to have severe dyspraxia. I can talk and ""look normal"" but only as a result of years of OT. I can't run properly or move quickly and the one thing I can't do is write.

My old school didn't teach students to write normally and we were scolded if our handwriting wasn't in cursive/joined up so I never learned to write like the other kids quickly - all my writing is in cursive and I only learnt to write with a fountain pen (the school also didn't allow us to carry non-fountain pens). I manage just fine as I have had a laptop concession and word processor for any writing task that takes longer than 30 minutes and recently taken it up full time as my condition worsened with puberty.

**Heres where my story starts**. My teacher (??M) (we'll call him Mr S) gave out the test papers for a history test - a test that requires 8 essay style questions so naturally I pulled out my device (that I don't normally use in history because there's not a lot of writing - its mostly sheets and bullet points) but Mr S stopped me. He said he didn't see my name on the list of students allowed (even though I am definitely on the list as the only student there with a concession and extra time) and demanded I put my device away or he'd give me a detention.

Begrudgingly, I put it away and decided if he wanted to play, then I'd shoot too. I'm rather petty and this was one of those instances but I feel it was justified.

I opened my paper and while writing my answer, I didn't exert myself. This was an hour long assessment and I knew I'd burn out if I did my ""bestest girlies neatest caligraphy"" so I didn't. I just wrote loosely and didn't clench my hand to the point of cramping.

By the final question, I was exhausted and practically scrawling away so I handed in my sheet and went directly to the head of counseling and welfare. I told her everything and she went to give Mr S a slap on the wrist and re load my name on the god protected list.

Soon after, Mr S reported me to a teacher I'm under for being ""disrespectful"" after my writing was ""unacceptable"" and basically accused me of attention seeking. I have cc (ed) in the welfare department who have my records in the email he sent me and made sure to keep up my teachers pet act I've been building my reputation around for the past 4 years (in front of teachers anyway) and now I'm having the office tell me it was unfair on Mr S who didn't know the severity of my condition and I should've just talked to him (I tried). However, my friends are backing me up.

Its been weighing on my mind so tell me Reddit.

Am I the Asshole?

TL;DR

My teacher didn't believe I had a real problem and forced me to hand write a test. I reported him and scrawled my essay.",Kidsdontcheatonyou,2845,148,0.949999988079071,0.0737563342746464,1739309806,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ina65n/aita_for_writing_so_bad_my_teacher_couldnt_read/,2025,2,AmItheAsshole,2025-02-11 21:36:46
1irx3w4,"AITA for refusing to stay at my niece + her husbandswedding accomodation because it costs almost €2,000?","We have paid for the flights to the wedding and when I said we would book somewhere outside of the venue (20 mins walk from the place), they got stroppy with me. 


The cost of the accomodation she was expecting my wife and I to pay was just south of €2000 on top of the flights that we (of course, happily) paid for. 


We simply cannot afford that accomodation price in the presence of an Airbnb that came in at a fraction of the price. However, we are being made feel guilty over wanting to do things cheaper. 


It feels rather unfair to be expected to fork out that much money (and without any clear lines of communication or early notice to begin with) yet we are being made out to be the enemy. 


Realistically, we will have paid for flights and our wedding outfits + gotten a gift for her so even before the big cost of the accommodation, we will have forked out even more before we even reach the destination!! 


Am I being unreasonable to not want to be in the accommodation because I don't want to pay that kind of money or is there some unwritten wedding etiquette I'm not following?

1inbt3w,"AITA for refusing to help my dad's ex-wife with rent after his passing, even though she is struggling and my half-brother is still a minor?","So here’s the situation. My dad passed away 3.5 years ago when my half-brother was 11 years old. My dad and his ex-wife had been separated for about 5 years before his death, but they weren’t legally divorced. During that time, they didn’t really have much contact, and she didn’t join any family gatherings or events. Even during the funeral, she wasn’t there where my aunt, my grandma, and I (32F) were, and I didn’t have a close relationship with her.

My dad was also struggling financially and he didn't left anything behind apart from a small boat he had purchased in my name, which I sold and put the money aside for my brother’s future and started paying towards his needs such as education fees and monthly allowances for him. My dad had still been supporting my half-brother’s mom financially, even though they weren’t living together, and I only had to communicate with her a few times fter his passing about my brother's expenses.

Here’s where things get tricky: my aunt has been paying the rent for my dad’s ex-wife and my half-brother for the past 3.5 years, as my dad’s ex-wife claims to be struggling financially. She works full time but also receives a pension through my dad. Now, the landlord wants them to move out, and my aunt, who has been helping with rent all this time, is not in a position to pay for the rent in the future apartment. My dad’s ex-wife is now asking me for help with rent, claiming she’s still struggling.

I’m honestly conflicted. I don’t have a strong relationship with her, and I don’t feel it’s my responsibility to help her out with rent, especially when I’m already helping my brother. I’ve made it clear that I can’t help with the rent, but she’s persistent and threatening me to tell my brother that I'm this bad sister who is not helping him out with their housing situation and she told me if I'm not helping her out with rent, I shouldn't act like a good sister and help out on anything else as well. I feel like it’s not fair that I should take on this burden when I’m already looking out for my brother’s well-being, and especially when my aunt has already been helping her all this time. My primary focus is on my brother’s future, and I just don’t want to take on any more responsibilities that aren’t my own.

I also want to mention that while my dad financially supported my dad’s ex-wife when they were separated, their relationship was strained, and I never felt close to her. I’m struggling with whether I’m being unreasonable for not helping her, even though she’s in a tough situation.

1iv57ax,AITA? I refused to go on my “birthday trip” with my family,"AITA, I got a text randomly from my mum saying she had booked for us to go to morrocco on my 20th birthday with the family. Sounds great right ?? Absolutely not. I come to find out that she had actually booked the tickets to go to my step sisters wedding in Morocco to marry a man she has known for 3 months. The marriage is a complete sham, my step sister and this mystery Moroccan man had previously agreed to get married so that he could  get a visa, allegedly they fall in love (all within 3 months) and now it’s genuine ???? It also turns out that we leave Morocco the morning after my birthday and my mum “couldn’t book any other flights” (she could they were just on sale so more convenient for her ig). She also didn’t give me a heads up or a choice in this so essentially she was content with ditching me on my 20th birthday (a big one in my opinion) to go to this fake wedding with a women she barely sees and a man she’s never met. My birthday would be rushed and spent packing our bags for the day after, I would have had to also spend the whole week hearing all about this wedding I don’t even agree on and living under the same roof as my stepdad and other step siblings I don’t get on with. It all just feels like it’s been rushed, poorly planned and is convenient for my mum because she gets to cram my birthday in at the end of it.

1ig95pn,AITA for expecting my best friend to be happy for my daughter when she received her college acceptances?,"AITA for telling my ""best friend"" that she was being rude and unsupportive of my daughter and me after she refused to acknowledge her college acceptances. We no longer speak after I confronted her. This friend of 30 years was one of only two or three people I told about almost every admission and scholarship. Some back story, my mom had passed away and it was really hard for me to not be able to share it with my mom. She was my go to. I didn't discuss it on social media until I could share a final decision. While my friend was having her own personal issues, I really tried to be supportive and encouraged her to celebrate life. I even gave her my Taylor Swift tickets at face value so she could make some great memories. I could have made thousands by selling them. So as college decisions were coming in and I shared the decisions with my friend, she eventually just didn't reply to my texts which isn't something she'd done before. When I confronted her about it, she got angry and asked incredulously if I expected her to be happy for every one. I said absolutely and I told her I feel great joy for every child getting accepted to colleges regardless of whether I know them. Her children are younger and so it wasn't in any way a comparison or competition. I feel so confused. This is a woman who offered to be my child's guardian if I died.

1ih278o,AITA for telling my boyfriend my dad was dead,"I (26F) lost my mother to cancer when I was 8 and have always had an absent father. I only found out who he was when I was 13 and even then he did not want custody of me forcing me to stay in the foster system until I was 18. Over my whole life I have had about 5 conversations with him give or take- he is like a stranger to me. He appears once in a blue moon to ask for money or something along those lines. It doesn't really bother me anymore, I've just learnt to accept it now but i don't like talking about it so to avoid that conversation with people i usually just say both my parents are dead.

This leads me to a year and a half ago when I had just started dating my boyfriend (25M) and like usual I had just told him my parents were dead but the other day my dad showed up at my door (I still don't know how he knows where I live) and asked for 100 dollars except my boyfriend was there and he obviously found out my dad was not dead. This lead to a long conversation with him that night where I explained the whole situation.

He said this was a breach of trust between us since I lied about my dad and that he needed some space to rethink our relationship but he doesn't think he will leave me.

I feel so shitty and that I should have told him earlier but I am going to be honest I just didn't think. So AITA?

UPDATE: my boyfriend texted me 5 mins ago asking to talk so we are going to have a full in depth conversation tomorrow after work and I'll update again then :)

  
UPDATE 2 (last update): Before I get to the update I would like clear things up.

1. I have only given money to my dad once when I was still desperate for his love and acceptance but he did not get any money this time.

2. Despite his confusion my bf stepped in to defend me and get my dad to leave and it was only after my dad left he asked me about it

Now onto the update. My boyfriend told me that all the sudden information along with the knowledge I hadn't told him the truth was very overwhelming and he just needed some space to not say the wrong thing. He also said that he got why I lied initially and he wasn't mad that I lied more hurt that I felt like I couldn't tell him about it. He also mentioned that he couldn't be there for me if he didn't know what was going on. The conversation ended in tears and it is the most vulnerable I have been in front of someone. He was very understanding and we have decided to draw a line in the sand and 'start again' if that makes sense.

I have also looked into therapy for my childhood trauma and all in all I am using this as an opportunity to better myself and heal fully.

1itka84,AITA for Getting a Tattoo of My Favorite TV Show Without Telling My Husband?,"So, I (24F) recently got a tattoo of a symbol from my all-time favorite TV show. I’ve loved this show for years, and the tattoo is something I’ve wanted for a long time. I didn’t think I needed to run it by my husband (26M) since it’s my body, and I figured he’d be indifferent at worst.

Well… I was wrong. He’s pissed. He says it’s not about the tattoo itself but the fact that I didn’t tell him beforehand. He feels like this was a “major decision” that a married couple should discuss. I, on the other hand, feel like it’s not a big deal—it’s not his body, and it’s not like I got a face tattoo or anything.

For context, the tattoo is on my arm, it’s fairly small, and it’s from a very popular show “Game of Thrones” It’s of the Targaryen sigil with the words “Vezhvenari, jikagon naejot rhaeshisar” which means “I will take what is mine with fire and blood” in High Valyrian .He’s not even against tattoos in general—he just thinks I should have included him in the decision.

1irxbpr,AITA for telling my friend's dad not to walk into my house uninvited?,"I (17f) and my friend (17f) hung out like we normally do at my house. She use to drive herself over, but she hit a deer and totalled her car (she was okay). Friend's dad drops and picks her up now, which was totally fine at first. 

He does this thing - that I think is weird - where he will walk her up to the door, and walk up to the door to pick her up. This was also fine, it may be weird but harmless. 
Recently, he's been rude (in my opinion). He picked up Friend and instead of doing the normal thing of knocking on the door and waiting for us to answer, he just walked in. Now, Friend just walks into my house but she has complete permission, her father does not. 

I talked to my mom about it the first time and she also thought it was very weird. just earlier today he came to get her, and he walked into my house. 
I said somthing along the lines of, ""did you just walk in?? Did you even knock?""

He said we don't respond when he knocks, so I said back that he could've texted or called, which he said we never reply. Not only is that not true, but he has the ability to ping her phone through parental controls. 

Now he says I'm getting too defensive about him walking in and says we're doing something we shouldn't be, but truly I just think it's weird and rude to walk into someone's house, not to mention a safety hazzard, without them opening the door for you when you don't have permission. He told Friend he didn't trust her further and he is obviously now iffy about her coming over here.

Very luckily if he doesn't allow her to come over we only have a few more monthsountil we're adults, but it would really suck. I don't know what to say or do anymore, but I don't think it's right on many levels to just walk into my house, not even my house but my mother's house. 

Tldr; Friend's helicopter dad walked into my house uninvited and without knocking, and thinks I'm too defensive about it. 


Edit/update

I should've clarified this in my original story, but the lock on my front door is slightly broken. It does lock, however it is pretty difficult and often it goes unlocked. I was recently told we don't always make sure the door is locked at night. My parents are aware of this, but my mother's husband isn't really a ""get it done"" Type of guy, and we've been low on funds. 

My house is one floor and it's fairly small, so if friend's dad knocked on the door, we are fairly sure we would've heard it. He let us know when he was leaving his house, about 15 minutes from my house. She was completely ready when he got there, about 25 minutes later, the reason we weren't standing right by the door when he got there. My step brother (also 17) was home but he didn't hear a knock, only came out when he heard the front door open. He said he knocked, but we're not entirely sure he did. 

I can drive and I offer to come get Friend, my mom also offers to get her because he drives her all the time but he insists that he drives her. My parents don't get home until past 4pm, and he knows that if he wants her home earlier than that he has to get her, or again we would drop her off later on.

I talked to my mom about everything later after it happened and it made her realize that if my friend's dad is going to just walk into our house, then really anyone can. 

Our house lock works like I said, but it's slightly broken and difficult to lock, however everyone in the house should be more careful to lock the door. We are also getting new locks after this, which is great. 

My mom is worried that Friend's dad won't allow her to come over anymore but it sounds like he's already on the edge about that. He is only seeing from our perspective and thinks we're hiding something, and if my mom tells him it makes her uncomfortable then hopefully he'll see from her side. 

No matter what happens my friend turns 18 in June and we graduate this year, so it's not too much longer but it still would suck not being able to hang out at my house anymore.

1itjygf,AITA for Stealing a Can of Beans?,"I (27M) went to the grocery store with my partner (24F) to simply buy some stuff for Christmas dinner. This includes lots of stuff, but more importantly 3 cans of beans. I start scanning everything and all was good until I got to the beans. Two of them scanned fine and when I got to the last can, it wouldn't scan after trying multiple times. I thought about it and decided that I couldn't be fucked to walk across the store get and grab a new can. (Honestly forgot that I could just re-scan another one.) We had been there a while and I just wanted to go home, so I just put it in the bag and walked out with the gf in tow.

She starts mildly panicking about the fact that we took it and to be honest I'm pretty un-bothered. This was about a week ago and since then we have argued multiple times about how, ""You're a a thief"" or ""You have no morals""

We went to an ice cream shop the other day and I grabbed two small items to try. One for me, one for her. As I'm standing in line to pay, she walked past me after her purchase and asked worryingly, ""Are you not going to pay for that?"" I don't know if she meant to be that snide about the comment, but when I asked her in the car what it was supposed to mean, she said, ""Well you've stolen something before, you'll do it again.""

This has caused her to view me as though I'm some crazy, hooligan, kleptomaniac that is just gonna steal everything in sight. IT WAS A $1 CAN OF BEANS!

I digress, but she was a pretty sheltered growing up and I was the complete opposite.

1ihswh4,AITA.    Am I the asshole for deleting my wife’s text that upset me?,"My wife has made it clear to me through our entire 10+ years together that she uses “yeah”, “yep”, and “lol” to show she’s basically giving the what the fuck ever reply to whatever she is responding to. She has stated this throughout the years. 
And I have asked her in the past multiple times to talk to me about what’s upsetting her instead of replying to me in her basically upset code words.
She refuses. It’s always those words by themselves. Me or someone else will text her full sentences and she’ll respond with only “lol”, “yep” or “yeah”.
She never uses them unless she is upset. It could be however long and she won’t use them for weeks, and then something will upset her and she will only use them to express she doesn’t care about what the person is saying and that she isn’t even caring enough to respond to it.

This has always upset me. A few months ago I started to just delete the one word text where she responds with those words so that I can just move on from them and not get upset by them. Because it genuinely upsets me when that’s the only reply I receive and that when I try to talk to her or ask what’s wrong I’m only given those in response.

She recently used my phone to look up a recipe she sent me in the past, and in doing so saw our text from my side, where I had removed the text with one word text. She is upset and says that I’m disrespecting her by removing them because they are still responses.
 Even if they aren’t replying whatsoever to what was said and even if they are dismissing what was said, not to mention you only use them when you don’t care to respond??
I said it doesn’t affect the conversations we have, it just keeps me from getting worked up because she uses them with no regard for how the other person feels. I just want to continue our conversations without seeing them because even if I ask about them she refuses to say anything.

1inbj0v,AITA for making a comment during the Super Bowl national anthem?,"
So this happened during a small Super Bowl party, and I left feeling kind of weird about it, so I wanted to get some outside opinions.

I was watching the game with my boyfriend’s family which included his parents, grandparents, and brother all gathered around on the couch. During the national anthem, I made an offhand comment about how the cameras always show one of the Kansas City Chiefs players crying whenever they pan to him, just an observation I’ve made during the seasons. It wasn’t meant to be disrespectful or anything, just an observation.

Immediately, my boyfriend’s mom shushed me. Like, full on in front of everyone turned her body and head as she was sitting in a chair in front of us. I was caught off guard, but I played it off, just said, “Im sorry” and covered my mouth and kept quiet. But in the moment, I felt really embarrassed, felt my face turn red, got clammy hands and a little sweaty. It wasn’t like I was being loud or talking through the whole thing, it was just a quick comment.

Later I told my family about it, and their reactions surprised me. They were shocked I didn’t “know” to stay silent during the national anthem. I explained that I do know that, I played competitive sports where they played the national anthem before every game. But it just felt different watching from home versus being at an actual game. If I would have known about the strictness of this rule before hand I obviously wouldn’t have said anything. I guess when my family does parties they are always big and loud with lots of people so getting a lot of people to stay quiet during the national anthem was never something I noticed to do at home. My dads comment at the end of the conversation really struck me when he asked, “Wait… she actually shushed you?” which made me rethink the situation and thus the validity of the moms reaction towards me.

So, AITA for talking during the national anthem while watching the Super Bowl on TV? Or was getting shushed in front of everyone an overreaction?

1isqjm1,AITAH for taking my dad home after missing a train instead of waiting for the next one?,"My dad (60m), my sister (22f) and I (20m) were supposed to take a train downtown for a car show. I was the one who arranged and paid for everything since I thought it would be good family time.

I told him to be ready at 12:15 pm so that we would have enough time to drive to the station and park before the train arrives at 1:04. The drive is about 25 minutes, so my thinking was that I would have 49 minutes to drive to the station and figure out parking and to get to our terminal (I had never been to this station so just wanted to have extra time incase things go wrong).

He said he would come out to the car at 12:15. My sister and I got to his house at 12:10 and waited. He didn't come out until 12:31. I told him we would be late but he said we were fine since it was a only a 25 minute drive.

We arrived at the station at 12:55. Here's where the first problem came up. We could only find reserved parking spots. We parked in a reserved spot so that I could get out of the car and go find somebody to ask where the regular lot was. Turns out, nobody is in the customer support area as it's a holiday. At this point, it's 1:00.

Then, my dad saw a security officer in the lot and told me to go ask him where the regular lot was. He told me it was at the other side of the road. So, I park up in the regular lot, run back to the boarding area (where my dad and sister was waiting). The doors of the train literally closed as I was about 20 metres from the train. 

My dad and sister didn't board as they saw I couldn't make it. I was upset, but willing to let it go as there was another train coming in an hour. Then, everything got heated. My dad got mad at me for missing the train because ""I should have known where to park instead of wasting time in the reserved lot looking for the regular lot""! Now I was mad. I told him that the reason I wanted to come earlier was because I didnt know the station and where everything was, and since he was late, we didnt have enough time. He said I shouldve researched the parking lot before coming. We got into an argument, which eventually got very bad. At this point I didn't even want to go to the car show as I was so pissed at him for blaming me. I told him that I would wait in the car and that he and my sister could go to the show and I'll pick them up when they come back. He called me selfish as he and my sister got ready for this family outing just for me and that he wanted me to come on the next train as we already made the drive over to the station. I told him no because I was in tears from the argument and wasn't in the mood to spend an entire day with him after he said terrible things to me for something he did.

Eventually, he got in the truck and we headed home. He told me to never speak to him again as I was selfish and wasted his time (he will hold this grudge for at least a month).

1jc77j4,AITA for calling out my husband's friend after he made inappropriate comments about my son's paternity?,"I (23 F) have been married to my husband, Alex (27 M), for 2 years, and we have a 10 month old son, Dylan.

Alex has a friend named Mike (27 M). They’ve been best friends since high school. From my first encounter, I did not like Mike. He is really childish, likes to be the center of attention, and has a crude sense of humor. It’s like he never got out of his frat boy phase. All of my husband’s friends are married or in long-term relationships, whereas Mike has never been in a long-term relationship or has brought any woman around. He has also made some weird comments toward me that made me uncomfortable. My husband has a deep bond with Mike, and they often go on hunting trips or have boys' nights. I’ve never tried to keep my husband from hanging out with his friend, but I have limited my contact with Mike as much as possible since we’ve been together.

Mike came over to pick up my husband to go golfing. I was holding our baby when I answered the door. Mike greeted us at the door, asked to hold my baby, and was cooing at him. Then he said, “Hey there, man…come to poppa,” and my husband and Mike started laughing. A bit of background: I have brown hair and blue eyes, and my husband has black hair and brown eyes. Our son’s hair is coming in blonde, and he has blue eyes. Mike has blondish hair and blue eyes. I was a bit caught off guard by it but ignored his comment. Mike then said, “He looks like me. Maybe he's mine,” and my husband and Mike continued to laugh. I was obviously not amused. I told Mike to hand me my son and then told him, “Not in a million years, and no woman with sense would want you.” Neither my husband nor Mike laughed at my comment, and Mike just made a face before he and my husband left.

Later, my husband told me I “took it too far” with Mike, that Mike was just joking, but I made it personal. I told him those comments were disrespectful to me as his wife and the mother of this child. He then said it’s obviously not true, so why am I so upset when I know how Mike is.

1jhkq9l,AITA for agreeing with my daughter it is weird her friend's mom has access to their conversations?,"My daughter is 14 years old and has a friend ""Chloe"". She and Chloe have been friends for a little over a year now. Chloe's mom ""Gina"" is someone I'd consider pretty strict. I was aware she'd check Chloe's phone (and I know a lot of parents do this), but I found out a few months ago through my daughter that she'd respond through Chloe's phone to Chloe's friends, including my daughter. It was never anything overkill, just ""Chloe can't talk right now, she's busy with homework"" or whatever. I thought this was odd but didn't say anything to Gina about it because that's her life and her business. 

I got a call from Gina earlier this afternoon. She was very pissed off and told me that my daughter was rude, I needed to start monitoring what she says, etc. I asked her what exactly happened and she said my daughter gave her an attitude via text. I was still very confused and asked why they were texting. Gina became exasperated and snapped ""Through Chloe's phone!!"" I told her I'd call her back and asked my daughter specifically what happened. My daughter willingly showed me her texts. She had texted Chloe something. Gina had responded (using Chloe's phone) saying Chloe was busy. My daughter replied asking when Chloe would be available to talk. Gina told her ""When she's ready, stop texting her"". My daughter replied ""You don't have to be so rude"". Gina said she wasn't being rude. My daughter said yes, Gina was, and also called her a weirdo for using Chloe's phone. 

I told my daughter next time, just don't engage. I did also say it wasn't kind to call someone a weirdo and not to do it again, but that I also understood her frustration. I didn't punish her, she seemed receptive to the talk and I left it at that. I called Gina back and told her I had spoken to my daughter and handled the problem. Gina started ranting that I need to monitor my daughter's phone and have I seen some of the things she talks about? She started on crushes, rants about teachers, saying there were times my daughter badmouthed me when frustrated. I said that's all fine, I'd rather her have a safe space to vent with her friends, after all, she's a teenager. Gina kept pressing on the issue and what would be done. I told her nothing, I spoke with my daughter and handled it. Gina said ""But she insulted an adult!"" I told her I handled it, but my daughter also didn't say anything that wasn't true, Gina \*was\* acting like a weirdo.

Now, Gina is angry with me, My daughter doesn't care that I said all of this. However, my husband thinks that I shouldn't have said it, as it didn't solve anything, and Gina can parent how she wants. I said I never commented on Gina's parenting, until she tried to undermine/insult mine.

1j59byb,AITA for feeding my family a fish dinner while I eat steak and potatoes,"So apparently we don’t get many characters so I’ll try my best to make this short and simple and straight to the point. 

I am three months pregnant and almost everyday I’ve been craving steak and sour cream baked potatoes. I never really cared for steak I’m more of a chicken fingers and fries girlie but I’m guessing the baby must’ve loved steak in its past life because that literally all I crave when I don’t even care for it. 
Today I made my family baked pizza spaghetti with fried catfish a lunch eat salad (salad with chopped deli meat) and dinner rolls. I of course am making the same dish I’ve been eating for almost everyday these last few months. I pretty much make 2 separate meals each night for my cravings. 

Last night after I served the kids and was getting ready to make my finances plate he expressed he wanted steak and potatoes like me. Mind you he was aware of the menu because I have my meals planned night before . I told him I only had that one steak for me. He said “ well we can share” I politely told him that I will need to eat all of my food since I am feeding for two and this is all I have for the night knowing I’ll most likely still be hungry whilst you guys have a meal you can come back for seconds. I am now, in his words a “selfish woman using pregnancy as an excuse to be selfish”. I asked what’s different about today than all the other days when I’ve been literally eating the same shit almost everyday with no complaints? He said nothing but shook his head and said “ it’s the principle bae” and just walked off. We’ve barely spoken since. Just a dry good morning and goodbyes. AITA?

1jamw4y,WIBTA for not going to my sister’s wedding because her venue is not wheelchair accessible?,"My (24F) sister (30F) is getting married soon. I’m very happy for her and there are no issues between the two of us.

She really wanted to get married in a specific location and she got it, which is great, but that location is pretty much not accessible to wheelchairs. I have a significant disability (paraplegia) and cannot move at all without a wheelchair, so going there would be tough.

She told me that I could be carried up any stairs and then stay at the tables, but that’s not something I’m comfortable with. Getting carried is very uncomfortable and dangerous, especially when done repeatedly by someone that isn’t used to it, and I really don’t want to have to be carried to the toilets at a wedding full of strangers… or even worse, have an accident.

Then I also wouldn’t expect people to just sit with me while the celebrations are going on, but the idea of sitting there and watch for hours feels wrong, especially that after a few hours sitting hurts a lot and skin becomes a concern, but I wouldn’t ask someone to leave the wedding just for me.

I’m not upset about the fact that they picked that venue, it’s their day and I don’t expect them to plan it based on my needs, but I also don’t think she understands that it’s not as easy as she thinks. There are so many things that could go very wrong.

I intend to get them a nice gift and propose to maybe spend quality time together afterwards/before. One of my cousins told me that it’s just one day and that it’s very important for my sister, so I should make an effort and “get out of my comfort zone”, but I feel like endangering my health isn’t as simple as getting out of my comfort zone…

1j606lg,AITA for leaning on a nearby wall after being denied use of gym equipment by a woman doing supersets?,"So my apartment building has a small exercise area including a cable crossover machine, an adjustable bench, dumbbells, some treadmills, and a small side room for yoga or other bodyweight/kettlebell exercises.


The gym was empty this morning except for one woman doing row exercises on the cable crossover machine. I noticed that she had placed her phone next to the bench with a couple of dumbbells. For context, I’m a tall-ish guy and she’s shortish and appears nonbinary (which is fine by me, I’ll refer to her as “she” here because I don’t know her pronouns or how she personally identifies). I specify this because it seems like that plays into the dynamic from her perspective.


“Can I use this bench?” I ask.


“No,” she replies. “I’m doing supersets.”


I was a bit taken aback. There is room for two, maybe three people in the resistance/weight training area, and she was using every piece of equipment.


Not sure what to do, I lean on a nearby wall and start looking at my phone. I’m a bit miffed and I look up every so often to see when she’ll be done. She takes her earphone out and says something to the effect of, “Are you just going to stand there?” and we get in a big argument.


I say something to the effect of “What else am I supposed to do? You won’t let me work in.”


“I don’t want you up in my space. Go do something else,” she says.


“So I can’t do pullups on the cable crossover while you’re using the bench?” I reply.


“No. I don’t want you up in my space,” she says.


“That’s just bad etiquette,” I reply.


It then continues like this for a bit. I accuse her of being rude, she accuses me (verbatim) of using my “male privilege.” Eventually she finishes her sets and leaves.

In every gym I’ve worked out at it would be considered rude to bogart multiple pieces of equipment while others have to wait. I lived abroad for years before this - is this still the case in US gym culture? AITA for leaning on a nearby wall and waiting, rather than going and stretching or running on the treadmill?

1jg2tqy,AITA for not loving my sister's children the way she and her husband do?,"TL;DR - On a recent visit to see my sister and her threr children, told me she was hurt and disappointed that I don't love her children in the same manner that she and her husband do. I told her this was an unreasonable expectation...AITA?

The past two years I (43f) have traveled to spend a week with my sister (40f) and her family. She and her husband and have three young boys - a 3.5 year old and twin 2.5 year olds. It's about a 6 hour flight, so it's not a trip I can make on a regular basis.

When I visited last February, it was a great trip. Good mix of sister time, hanging out with the kids and her husband, a night out, a house party, just all around enjoyable. Her husband is great and is a stay at home Dad. My sister works from home and is a successful business woman. I was genuinely excited to go visit again last month.

I'm not a kid person and I never have been. My partner and I are intentionally childless and we love our quiet, low key life. I'm good with kids. I'll play with them with their toys, I'll crawl around on the floor with them, I'm down to do whatever goofy thing they're into - but for only about 2 hours at a time. Then I have to tap out and recharge.

I'm also not great with the constant noise kids make. I understand that's just what they do, but I've got a low threshold for it, especially when it's the full blown meltdowns. For the first 3-4 days I was at my sister's, the three kids were screaming and crying nearly every 25 minutes. So when the temper tantrums started, I'd go outside or at least leave the room.

At one point, the kids and husband are out of the house and my sister took the opportunity to tell me how she's disappointed that I ""don't love the boys the way (husband's name) and I do."" 

I said that I do love the boys and I asked if there was something I did or didn't do with the kids that upset her. She said no, that I was great with them. I asked if she thought I was paying enough attention to them. She said I was, but brought up my low tolerance for the fits. I apologized and reminded her that I'm really not used to it and that it's kind of stressful, so I just remove myself from the situation.

Things kind of devloved from there, but we recovered and the rest of the trip was fine enough. Am I the asshole thinking that my sister's request is way off base? I love my nephews, but I don't think anyone can love children in the way that child's parents do. 

Edit: Thank you for all the feedback! It gave me a lot of things to think about and reflect on. I've come to think my sister's criticism that I don't love her boys like she does is not an actual, literal expectation. I think it might be a weird, kind of manipulative way of saying ""I need you to think I'm a good parent.""

1jbew6q,AITA for “sneaking” vegetarian food into my FIL’s meal?,"Not a throwaway but a private because my fiancé knows my main. 

My fiancé (23M) and I (23F) plan to get married in October of this year. I'd like to start off by saying i'm not looking to end my relationship with my fiancé. 

I'm a vegetarian, my fiancé is not, nor are his parents. This has never been a problem for me, my him, or his mother. But my father in law has always been weird about it.

For example, whenever we all go out to eat and I order something vegetarian, he always gives me weird looks. He also always tries to convince me to eat meat, saying things like ""You're really missing out."", ""You know you want some of this."", ""That fake meat will never be better than the real thing."", Etc.
 
Yesterday, my fiancé and I invited his parents over to our house for dinner. I made spaghetti & meatballs for my fiancé and his parents, spaghetti & vegetarian meatballs for me, I put them in two different pots and put them both on the table.

When his parents were grabbing their food, his father happens to grab the spaghetti and meatless meatballs instead of the real ones.

Now here's where I might be the A-hole, after I see him put the meatless meatballs on his plate instead, I decide not to tell him. He sits down, finishes the whole plate, and even gets a second helping.

Once his parents left and me and my fiancé were cleaning up, I tell him about the whole fake meat thing. My fiancé gets really mad at me and immediately calls his dad.

His dad then calls me and starts berating me on the phone, saying i'm a psycho and my fiancé should leave me for trying to ""poison him""???

I try to defend myself by saying I wasn't the one that gave him the fake meat, and he grabbed himself (which is 100% true) 

My fiancé says I should of told him which was which, but I genuinely don't see the problem. I know he isn't allergic to soy beans or anything, so I don't see the harm in trying vegetarian food once.

I think I might be the A-hole because usually my fiancé always defends me when his father and I get into arguments like this, but the fact that he isn't worries me. So reddit, AITA?

Update: A bit of a quick update, but after reading your comments i've decided i'm going to apologize to my FIL, whether I was in the wrong or not it wasn't right to not tell him what he was eating.

Also, I've seen a lot of comments saying if it was the other way around i'd be screaming at him or something. Just wanna say no I wouldn't, sure i'd be a little sad but i've accidentally eaten meat a few times (been vegetarian since I was 16) and I don't really care. 

Thank you for all your comments! :)",Sherry7Cooky,2004,960,0.8899999856948853,0.2731045927493664,1741987788,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jbew6q/aita_for_sneaking_vegetarian_food_into_my_fils/,2025,3,AmItheAsshole,2025-03-14 21:29:48
1jcwo15,AITA for not doing an art commission I was not told about?,"Title sounds a little confusing, wasn't sure how to best word it. Hopefully this all makes sense! 

I (F33) do a lot of art in the needlework medium. Embroidery, cross-stitch, weaving etc. I'm going to toot my own horn here, I'm very good at it. I've won first prize at a couple of our state fair competitions, and the one tapestry piece I had in a gallery sold for a good bit of money.  

A few years ago I made a choice I would no longer take commissions. The deadlines, back and forth between clients and all that jazz made me hate what was once a hobby I could do for hours shutting my brain off. I'll still make presents on occasion (my wife's bff just had a baby, and I made a cross-stitch birth announcement for the nursery, for example) but anything outside of that is not happening.  

This past week I got a message on my Instagram from my friend ""Mike's"" friend ""Abigail."" Abigail said Mike recommended me for an embroidery she wanted done, and how soon could I get to the process. I told Abigail I was sorry, but I no longer take commissions and Mike knew that already. Abigail was a little pissy, but Mike- omg. He texted me in a fury saying he really buttered up my work to Abigail and he was trying to date her and I've fucked things up for him.

I'm sad that Mike is acting this way, but I also wonder that since Abigail was ""misled"" about me not doing commissions- should I just do it? My wife says absolutely not and I 85% think she's right, but I just wanted the perspective of people who aren't married to me, lol.

1j7itfg,AITA for refusing to change my bachelorette trip date and shutting down a friend’s attempts to reschedule?,"I’m getting married this year, and my friends (a group of 16) and I have been planning my bachelorette trip. To make scheduling fair, I asked everyone to send me the dates they were not available so I could pick a date that worked for the most people—especially since some friends are traveling from other countries.

After going through everyone’s responses, there was only one date that worked for everyone. So, I announced it.

That same day, one of my closest friends suddenly said she had been planning a trip around that time. However, she had never mentioned it before, hadn’t booked flights, and was only reconsidering her dates because someone told her her destination might be crowded.

Since the condition for choosing my trip date was to prioritize the availability of the most people, I explained to her three separate times why that date was final. Despite that, she kept trying to change it. She even created another poll in our group chat to see if others could move their own important plans to accommodate her.

She also started privately messaging people, trying to convince them to say they could be flexible. At first, I didn’t directly call her out in the chat, but after she made a second poll, I sent a general message stating that the date was already chosen and wasn’t changing. Now, she’s upset and claims I embarrassed her by “calling her out” instead of speaking to her privately—even though I had already tried three times.

I feel like she put me in a tough position, making me choose whose availability mattered more. I understand she really wants to be there, but I also think it was unfair for her to disregard everyone else’s plans.

I have no intention of changing the date, and honestly, I’m not planning to apologize because I don’t think I did anything wrong.

We need all of them unlocked, it’s a fire hazard.” Now keep in mind this has never been an issue before, I even asked my other roommate M28 if he locks his door and he told me he does and John never said anything to him about it.

I texted him back saying “No, if there’s a problem with my room being locked during the day it needs to be told to me by the landlord” all I got back was “okay I’ll tell him to tell you”.  AITA here?

1joe3w9,"AITA for charging an “entry fee” for a family dinner on April 1st, leading my aunt to think it was an April Fool’s joke?","I (26F) am the go-to host for family dinners, and I usually enjoy it. But my aunt (55F) has a frustrating habit: she shows up uninvited with extra guests like friends or random relatives without telling me. It’s happened too many times, leaving me to stretch food and space on the spot. I’ve asked her nicely to give me a heads-up, but she just says, “Family should be spontaneous,” and ignores me.

With today being March 31st, I’m hosting a family dinner tomorrow, April 1st, for my parents’ anniversary. Knowing my aunt will likely crash it with extras, I decided to try something new. Last week, I sent a group message saying that because hosting costs keep rising (and the guest list keeps growing), I’m asking each adult to chip in $10 to cover expenses. I figured this was a fair way to handle it without pointing fingers.

Tomorrow’s the big day, but I can already picture it: my aunt will roll up with three unannounced friends. When I ask for the $10 contributions at the door, she’ll probably laugh and say, “Oh, great April Fool’s joke!” I’ll have to explain it’s not a prank and that it’s about respect and planning, especially since she keeps doing this. I’m betting she’ll get mad, call me “stingy,” and storm off, which has happened before when I’ve set boundaries.

The family’s already split. Some think I should let it slide since it’s a special occasion (and tomorrow’s April Fool’s Day might confuse things), while others say I’m right to stand my ground. I’m worried my aunt will spin it as me pulling a “mean prank” if she takes it the wrong way.

1jnnggj,AITA for turning away my partner's grandparents when they showed up unannounced?,"My partner and I had twins in February. We're currently living in her parents' neighboring house because they acquired it after the neighbor passed away, and we're renting/renovating it with them. We have set clear boundaries that we don't want surprise visitors, and we would like it if they only came over once or twice a week so we can have some privacy. 

Today, my partner's dad texted her while she was trying to nap, letting her know that her grandmother (his mother) had shown up at their house unannounced. We appreciated the heads-up, and she continued with trying to rest, as the twins were finally fed, changed, and no longer being fussy. About 10-15 minutes later, her phone starts ringing, and I see it's her dad. I answered, and he let me know her grandma and grandpa were walking over. I told him I would turn them away, as everyone was finally sleeping and it wasn't a good time. He said ""You shouldn't do that, because it will start a fight."" I said ""Oh well, it's not a good time.""

Her grandparents rang the doorbell twice during that phone call, almost back to back, waking her and one of the boys up. I told her to just keep sleeping, I'll deal with it. I answered the door, and her grandma could tell I was exhausted, because she asked if we were sleeping. I said ""Yes, we all are."" She said ""Too bad,"" and tried stepping towards the door. I pulled it shut a little more so it was barely open enough for me, and told her ""No. It's not a good time. They haven't been sleeping good, and I don't want them waking up since they're finally asleep."" She pretended she was ok with it, and parted ways.

A few minutes later, my partner called her dad with the boys screaming in the background, telling him we turned them away. He did what he usually does when he's mad, and kept giving short, one or two word replies. Then, after she was done talking, he blew up, talking about how he's going to have to deal with her grandma being pissed off now, and saying something like ""I might as well fucking broadcast your damn rules to everyone to not show up unless they call ahead!"" along with some other stuff I didn't catch, as I was in the other room. She started crying, said bye while he was still yelling, and hung up.

Now I feel like I shouldn't have told her grandparents to come back another day, because her dad apparently can't deal with his mother's (or his own) emotions, and it would've been easier to just deal with them coming in and disturbing the peace that we had just managed to establish. So, AITA for turning them away?

1j59fnv,AITA for snapping at my boyfriend's friend for touching my hair?,"

I'm (15M)  black and I live in a predominantly white area and go to a mostly white school and I'm pretty introverted. I have a fro and the amount of people who will just up and try/ start touching my hair is wild. It's gotten to the point where it pisses me off.   I met my bf Colt (15M) at a wrestling meet a few months ago and I let him play in my hair and I play in his curly jewfro.  It's just kind of an intimate soothing thing between us.

We go to different schools so we don't hang around each others friends a whole lot. Saturday he was having like a movie marathon with some of his friends and he wanted me to come. While there one of his friends some white girl named Madison starts just playing in my hair saying it's softer than she thought. I immediately jerked back and asked her WTF are you doin? She tells me she just wanted to see what it was like. I snapped at her that I wasn't a damn dog and she gets all defensive saying she saw Colt doing it and thought it was ok. I yelled at her that I'm not dating her and went home.

Colt came over later and apologized for her ,but he says I didn't have to get so upset and go off on her like that. He says people come up to him trying to touch his jewfro to see what Jewish hair feels like all the time and he never took it that seriously.. I tell him it's kinda different but he still thinks I overreacted. AITA?

Anyways the last time she was over, my husband and her were talking about kids (Erica and her so have kids, as do we) and mornings got brought up. 

For some information, I don’t do mornings, my husband does. He works 9-6 and I start at the same time as him but end earlier. He does mornings because he doesn’t mind waking up earlier, and I get more sleep and less on my mind in the morning. It’s an arrangement that works for us and I always do mornings if he’s sick or physically can’t.

When Erica found that out, she started with judgement. I was in the same room as them but just wasn’t adding to the conversation. Stuff like “Oh both my husband and I do mornings” and “Kind of sucks you’re on your own 100% of the time.”  I didn’t like that and let her know that my husband and I’s decisions aren’t any of her business.

1jmxadw,AITAH? Told my girlfriend not to use my electric face razor on her vag but she did anyway.,"So long story short, in the past my gf (me 27, her 26) admitted to using my razor on her coochie. I told her to never do that again and even gave her my old electric one to use. Fast forward to recent and I found out she used it again. Along with that, I have been telling her for months to stop showering without the fan on or door open a bit as it’ll cause water damage over time. Well, at the same time of finding out about the razor, she had made the bathroom walls wet with water again and I blew up a little bit. She has a hard time taking any criticism and has a hard time admitting fault so this went over not too great. Now a week or so later I was asking where something of mine was and if she possibly used it. Her response was, “why do you always assume I’m using your stuff???” I threw back, “says the person that was asked to not use my razor on her vag yet she did anyway!” Now for the first time she has decided to go spend the Saturday on her own instead of having me come with. I’m not worried we’re drifting apart, however I don’t want these things to keep happening without change.

1jicfiz,AITA for calling friend’s penis decent?,"I (19F) am currently on spring break. Me and my friends (as well as some of their friends) decided to go to a nearby beach. It was a two day trip where we go swimming, eat out, and do a little shopping before heading back. While we were on the beach, some of us got hungry. A few people decided to go to a nearby gas station to grab some snacks and bring it back, while others stayed. I stayed and so did B (20M). B is a friend of a friend, and we aren’t that close, but we did get along. We stayed to watch over everyone’s stuff in case it got stolen or anything. 

The two of us were chatting and sitting. Now I want to note, he was wearing a *really* short trunks, which wasn’t a problem. Until he moved his legs and his penis peeked through his shorts. He didn’t realize and I felt awkward to point it out because I didn’t know this guy that well. I had only met him a few days ago. But after a minute or two, I kind of hinted for him to look down and he got shocked. He fixed the issue and we sat there awkwardly and didn’t say anything. 

That night, I get a call from B. He told me he was embarrassed about the situation and that he didn’t mean to flash me. I said to not worry about it because it was clearly an accident. Then he asks me what I thought about his penis. I was shocked and unsure how to respond. So, I just said that it was decent. Now, in hindsight, I genuinely do not know what I meant by decent. I just blurted it out since that was the first word that popped in my head. He got upset and was wondering why it was decent, and I didn’t have a response. We hung up. 

The next day, I saw him at breakfast and could clearly see he was upset. He wasn’t upset at anyone else and made it a point to completely avoid me, not sitting or standing near me. I assuming it was because of what I said about his penis. 

Now, I haven’t told anyone about this event, mainly because I don’t want to embarrass him or anything.

1j4gw7k,AITA: opened a jar of sauce to use some and put the rest in the fridge,"So to preface this: my (18m) mom (47 F) usually has no issue with opening jars of red sauce, using a little, then putting them in the fridge and using them for a meal later on. My dad does it, I do it, she does it, my grandma does it. She has never expressed a problem with it before. This is important. It is also important to note I am autistic. 

So tonight, I opened a jar of Alfredo sauce. I asked my brother (12 M) for help with opening the jar, and mom starts freaking out and saying not to open it- but by the time she said anything, it was already open. So I used the sauce in my pasta and she starts complaining that it can’t be used for a meal now. 

Thankfully I had the self control not to say my immediate response out loud, and instead said “Yes it can?? It’s not like I stuck my fingers in the jar.” 

And now she’s moping on her phone and acting like I’ve committed a federal offense. 

Did I do something wrong?? Am I the asshole or is this stupid…
ETA: I closed the jar and put it back when I was done with it. Because it’s Alfredo, once it’s open you’re supposed to fridge. She’s never had a problem with this before, even with other cream based sauces. She never said I couldn’t open the Alfredo UNTIL it was already open.

1j3n68v,UPDATE AITA for reporting my coworker for cheating in the company walking competition?,"So the feedback on my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ipgc44/aita_for_reporting_my_coworker_for_cheating_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) made me feel like less of an asshole for sure but what happened next definitely got rid of any remaining guilt I may have had.

Tiffany won the steps competition.

After I spoke with Matt he tried to clear things up with Tiffany but in his words she was “combative and rude” so he ended up looping in our HR rep, Jill. Jill decided that Tiffany could keep her 65,000 steps and the rules would just be clarified for everyone going forward.

Well going forward Tiffany continued to post 35,000-40,000 steps every single day. Less ridiculous then 65,000 but still ridiculous considering we all sit at desks 8 hours day. It was still a tight race between the 4 of us, because we (Dave Jenna and I) had been posting higher then Tiffany prior to the 65,000 step day. Then Dave got sick. He only posted 4,000 one day and that was enough for him to fall too far behind. Then I had something urgent and time consuming come up at work and only got 10,000 steps that day. That was enough for me to fall too far behind too. So it was basically up to Jenna at that point and she was really working for it. Even got up at 4am the last couple days of the competition to try and max out steps. The highest she ever got to was about 41,000 and in the end Tiffany beat her by about 250 steps overall.

Tiffany had zero issue happily accepting her award at the next company wide meeting and gave this super annoying speech about how “everyone did so great” and how in the end she’s “just glad we all became more active and healthy.”

1jjxve6,AITA for refusing to go to the store when my significant other cooks meals for me?,"My signifiant other (M38) and I (F35) have lived together for over a year. His mother and our daughter (F13) are also in the home. He is the primary cook in the home as he prefers to cook and is picky about how the food is prepared. He also does the majority of the shopping because he prefers to shop at certain stores. I do also cook occasionally and pay for meals when we order out. Additionally when I give him money to assist with bills I give extra to help pay for food costs. I do also clean the kitchen after each meal which is not a small task because he doesn't clean as he cooks and typically any thing he touches in the meal prep process is left out. None of this bothers me so much as when he asks me to go to the store for last minute ingredients. For some reason he never has all the ingredients right before the meal needs to be cooked. For instance tonight, he starts cooking pasta at 6:45pm and right before he cooks he forgot that we did not have noodles. He started planning dinner at 10am. He then expects me to drop anything I am doing to go to the store to get the items. When I say ""no, you could have asked earlier or planned better"" he accuses me of being lazy or not helpful. He does this during holidays too. Days before the holiday I asks several times does he need me to go to the store. Every day leading up to the holiday he says no, then inevitably the day of the holiday he needs a few ingredients. I ask him all the time just to be thoughtful of my time because I could end up having to make trips to the store everyday due to his poor planning. I am starting to feel he does this as a way to make me earn my meal.

I offered to send her money just in case, but she refused. I suggested she grab something quick from Tesco (like a meal deal), but she refused. I even offered to take the train to see her and bring food, but she refused that too. Lastly, I offered to pay for a food delivery—McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell, Boojum—but she turned them all down.

1jfz99i,AITA for telling my coworker to “freshen up” for an important event?,"Throwaway account since the people involved use Reddit. 
I (32M) work at a company with the occasional events. I take them as chances to network with people from other companies and so on. 

My coworker [33M], who we’ll call Ben is pretty scruffy. Showing up to work in the same outfit he wore the previous day and even sleeping at his desk sometimes. I’ve never interacted with him 1-on-1 per se but we’ve been on the same projects and I’m friendly with him. 

Here is where the issue is: Recently, there was a company event, and, for once, Ben didn’t really participate or speak about it beforehand, so most of us assumed he wasn’t going. I didn’t expect him to come of course, but he did in the most unprofessional outfit. He was wearing wrinkled clothes and colors that didn’t match. Like he rolled out of bed. He walked up to my circle and we locked eyes and I joked that he should’ve freshed up a bit to an event like this and there were some chuckles but everyone was mostly silent. 

He soon walked away and my other coworker pulled me aside and told me that I was way out of line, and her and my colleagues think that I shouldn’t have spoken about his attire especially since I don’t know him very well. I thought I was just making a joke to lighten the mood. I haven’t seen him since and he’s been actively avoiding me. mostly everyone in my circle is expecting me to apologize to Ben, AITA for making a joke? 

Edit: I understand how the joke wasn’t a joke at all  now, and I’ll be apologizing to Ben at work tomorrow.

I met my friend today (26F) while wearing it and she was shocked and asked when I got engaged? I was confused and asked what she meant since I'm single and she just pointed at the ring.

I laughed and said no it just looked cool. She responded with accusing me of catfishing girls.

1j7hy7m,AITA for telling my husband his mom can't live with us for months-long stretches,"My husband and I have been married for almost 2 years and our son is 10 months old. My parents live nearby which has been invaluable during my pregnancy and since. My mom comes over regularly to help us out, my husband and her are on good terms too so it's been going well. His parents live in another country. We have visited them once since we got married, that was 7 months ago. The time prior to that was our wedding itself which took place there.

My husband had been talking about my MIL visiting soon for a long visit which I was happy with. We recently moved into our new house, I've done a good job decorating it, we have a large guest room, and I was looking forward to hosting her especially since it would make my husband happy. A couple of days ago he was complaining about how detailed her visa application was. I told him I was surprised it was so thorough. He told me that it's because while regular visa forms allow a stay of 6 months max, this one allows 2 years. I asked why would she need a stay of more than 6 months. He said that she had been thinking of winding up her medical practice and basically retiring, and this would then allow her to stay for a longer visit if we all decide that it works.

I was stunned. I told him he should just do the regular app because his mom won't be staying for anywhere close to 6 months. I had it in my mind that she'd be staying for like a month. That's how long we stayed for when we went there. He said that's his mom, she tells him how alone she feels, she can't go to my BIL's because he lives with roommates, and we can't just put a timer on her visit here. He said she's been looking forward to helping us out with our son. I told him we don't need help we manage fine on our own and with my mom's help. I wanted to host his mom as a guest not as a part of our household. He complained that how was it fair that my parents could visit whenever they wanted while his can't. I was hurt by that because my parents have helped us out a lot and I asked him if he wants us to limit how often my mom comes to visit. He said no, that's not what he meant, that he likes her but it wasn't fair to his parents. My reply was that when my mom comes, she goes at the end of the day. That wouldn't be the case with his. I ended it by saying he should look into the easier regular form because she can't be thinking of staying for that long. He chose to sleep on the couch that night and has been cold with me since. I hate that. We've never been cold to each other like this. 

I talked to my mom too. She said that having his mom live with us for long stretches would definitely affect me. That this is worth fighting for.

I haven't seen him working on the application since. Last night he went out when his mom called. When he came back I asked him how she took it. He told me he had told her he's looking into what application best suits her. He asked me if I'd changed my mind. I said no. He just shook his head and started watching TV.

1j60urv,AITA for changing my legal name ?,"Hi! I was born after my mom had a stillborn baby. She was supposed to be named Angélique (a French name because my mom’s French). My stillborn sister was born and died on December 6th, 2004. Then my mom had me on May 6th, 2006, and named me Coline (another French name, like Colleen).

Listen, so the problem is—when I was told this story, I was about 14. I had never known before, but I had always hated my name due to bullying and really dumb jokes about it. But then it started getting weird for me because, in France, you have a name day, which is basically a celebration of your name for a day (because of Christianity or something—I don’t really know, I’m not very Christian. I don’t know if other countries do this).

I discovered that my mother gave me the name Coline on purpose because it was celebrated on my stillborn sister’s birthday. That made me feel like I was just a replacement for her since Angélique was supposed to be my mom’s last kid (she said that to my face, yeah).

What made it even worse to wear my name was my father. I won’t go into details, but he’s an asshole. He straight-up said they were supposed to have an angel—referring to my sister—but had the devil instead (me, lol). He also said he would have preferred if I had died instead of my sister.

Around that time, I started talking to my friends about it and asked them to call me by a new name I picked, which had nothing to do with my sister—Lyx. They all agreed and have never stopped calling me Lyx since I was 14. I’m now almost 19. They even call me Lyx when talking to my mom, but she got mad at me and said she would disown me if I dared change my name to Lyx.

So, AITA for wanting to change my name?

1jg3cvi,AITA for not inviting my pregnant sister in law to my wedding?,"My partner and I are due to get married soon. My brother David has always been viewed as the favourite in my family, and so is his wife Jill. I on the other hand am always viewed as the problem in my mothers eyes

A few years ago, we celebrated my step brothers wedding with our family.  David, Jill,  my fiance and I  stayed in an apartment and had breakfast together the next morning and all was seemingly great. That was until later that afternoon when I received a call from my mum saying Jill was at her house in tears because I insulted her appearance at the wedding. I have zero recollection of this but my fiance was with me the whole night and was adamant that I did not say anything, plus Jill showed no signs of being upset or annoyed with me at any point. I was disappointed that my mum did not ask me and jumped to conclusions that I was in the wrong. I apologised to Jill and that was seemingly the end of it. 

Our relationship with Dave and Jill has been icy since then and Jill has made no effort to engage with my fiance on our upcoming wedding at family events. At Christmas, when we were visiting my mum and step dad, Dave and Jill both arrived and announced that they are expecting a baby (first grand kid in the family) and that’s it’s due on our wedding day. After a few drinks my step dad made a remark that ‘our big day is now about Dave and Jill aswell’ I spoke to my mum about this and she assured me that this wouldn’t be the case and that they would be celebrating us, my step dad disagreed again. Our wedding day is really important to us and our friendships. We have a two day wedding, the first day is a ceremony and a meal in an upmarket restaurant for 30 of our closest friends and immediate family. The next day is a party for all our other friends and extended family. David and Jill are invited to both days but given the long day and that she is due to give birth on the day, we did not have the space to accommodate Jill for the evening meal. She also said she didn’t want to go originally as she doesn’t like that kind of food but has changed her stance since on wanting to attend. 

My mum has now demanded that we invite Jill to the meal and has been pretty aggressive towards me and my fiance. We have stated that we don’t have the space (my fiances close friends and step mum aren’t going) and that we don’t think it’s suitable, the ceremony at the meal is very intimate and we only want our closest friends there. My mum has now said that they need to be there for Jill in case she goes into labour and so she needs to be at the venue. I should point out that Jill also has family albeit they are a 1 hour flight away, and not all of our family are going to the meal. We are paying for the wedding ourselves too. I just feel like this should be a day to celebrate me and my to be wife but my family have made it clear that they want it to be about Jill,who has made it clear she doesn’t even like us. So please help, AITA?

1j4hpft,AITA for not telling husband he could get a form notarized instead of going with me in person to get our baby’s passport,"Yesterday we were in line at the post office for our baby's passport application appointment. We had a 12:30 noon appt but there were still 3 applicants ahead of us since they were backed up (meaning at least 30-40 min wait on top of the 20+ we'd already waited). The lady in back of us asked if she needed both parents for her baby's renewal; I said 'I think yes both parents need to be present or you can submit a notarized form on behalf of the dad.' My husband heard and started to get really angry that I hadn't told him. Then he said 'let's go home' and we proceeded to have a huge argument where he yelled at me and said I ""hid"" the fact from him and wasted his time. I explained that it didn't even cross my mind as we are together and both local. He said I should have at least mentioned the notary option to give him a chance to decide. I didn't know that the wait would be so long since we had an appointment. He called me ""negligent"" for not knowing that these things take a long time. I told him the passport process is his responsibility too, but he thinks that since I'll be waiting in line anyway, I should have respected his time and made it as quick as possible for him by giving him the notary option so he doesn't have to go and interrupt his day to come in person. So now he said he'll do the notarized form on HIS TIMING ""I'll do it when I do it and I don't want you asking me about it"" and then I have to go back a third time AGAIN on my own to apply for the passport. 

For context this was our second time at the post office because the first time we didn't have an appt and the line was so long we left and made an appt to come back. I honestly did not know the lines would be so long and backed up; who knew so many people would be applying for a passport at any given time? Husband thinks I should apologize for not telling him about the notary option and “not respecting his time”. Looking back, that would have been the way to go given that its been so difficult coordinating times with him to go (he's been dragging his feet on this because he doesn't care to go on any international trips anytime soon and I do, which is another issue). He's very protective about his time, especially on weekdays and mid-day events as it ""interrupts his flow."" Meanwhile I think it's crazy that he feels so entitled to me mentioning the notary option. I'm annoyed at him for being such a maniac about this. I think we should have just waited and finished the task; the argument + getting the notarized form + going back is going to take way more time than if we had just waited. AITA?

1j4hmt0,AITA for being offended that the girl I'm dating keeps saying that she hates men.,"I (30 M) have been dating a woman (29) for about two months. The dates have been going well and she’s been super nice to me. However, lately, she’s been talking repeatedly about how much she “hates men.” 

It started when she invited me over to her house when she was extremely drunk and we were watching “Love is Blind.” She went on an hour long tirade about how she hates the men on the show and she probably said the phrase “I hate men” about a dozen times. I brushed this off because she was very drunk and angry about the reality show. 

However, two days later we went for dinner and I recommended a book to her. She said that she probably wouldn’t read it because she hates male authors. I said this was kind of limiting, but I agreed with her and made a joke about how bad male authors are at describing female characters. She then started talking more about how she hated men and said “I don’t think men should get therapy because they will use it against you.” She then realized how bad this sounded and said “obviously I’m joking. I think everyone should get therapy.” I’m very non-confrontational so I made a joke about how I’ve never had therapy and we talked about other things until the night ended.

The next day I sent her a text saying that she should stop saying that she “hates men” because it makes me feel like she hates me. She replied: “I only hate men who take it personally!!”

Did I overreact? Am I being too sensitive about jokes that she’s making towards men in general and not me specifically?

1jkqimr,AITA for not offering to split gas on a road trip I didn’t want to go on?,"Last weekend, I (24F) got dragged into a spontaneous hiking trip with my friends Jason and Lily (they’re a couple). We were hanging out Friday night at their place—I was already half-dead from the work week and had too much wine, so I just crashed on their couch.

Saturday morning, I was super hungover, like dry mouth, hoodie-over-eyes level. All I wanted was some water, maybe a hash brown, and no human interaction. But Jason was already up and buzzing about this hike four hours away. Lily was into it too. I said, very clearly, multiple times, “I’m down to hang but I’m not hiking. I feel like crap.”

They were like, “Oh come on, you’ll feel better once we’re out there,” and “It’s mostly flat.” I didn’t push back hard enough, I guess. I wasn’t trying to be a buzzkill. Next thing I know, we’re in Jason’s car, and I’m wedged in the back with my hood up and a bottle of Gatorade.

Spoiler: I never hiked. We got there, I walked to the trailhead, and then just sat in the car with the windows cracked, reading a paperback I found in the backseat (I think it was Lily’s copy of Circe? Good book though). They were gone for three-ish hours, came back sweaty and glowing and very into themselves. I clapped politely. We drove back.

Then—on the drive home—Jason says, all casual, “So if y’all could Venmo me like thirty bucks for gas, that’d be great.”

I hesitated and said, “Wait, seriously?” I told him I didn’t really feel comfortable paying for a trip I didn’t want to go on and didn’t participate in. I said it as lightly as I could, like I even added a half-laugh so it didn’t sound rude, but neither of them responded.

It got weirdly quiet after that. Like… not just “we’re tired” quiet, but stiff, polite quiet. Lily scrolled through Instagram the rest of the ride. Jason turned the music up and didn’t really talk to me again until they dropped me off.

I texted later that night just to say thanks for driving anyway, and Lily replied with a thumbs-up emoji. Not even a “np” or anything, just 👍.

I’ve been replaying it in my head because I do get that gas isn’t free, but also—I didn’t want to go, I said that, and I barely even left the car. I felt like I was being held financially hostage for a vibe I wasn’t part of.

1jj5ihj,AITA for disagreeing with my wife to alter my birthday gift that my friend gave me?,"So a friend of mine gave me frames with quotes and poems that resonated with me. I was really moved by his gesture and the thought he put into it. A couple days later, my wife said the photos in the frames are 'bad resolution' and that she wants to print the same images in better resolution so it doesn't look pixelated. To be fair, the images were pixelated, but I told her thats a part of the gift and it means something to me. So I wouldn't want to replace the photos, even if they're exactly the same (ship of theseus?). 
Today she went ahead and printed the new images (exactly the same image, dimensions etc.) and replaced those in the frames from my friend. She said she'll still hold on to the photos my friend gave with the frames. I had no clue she was going to do it despite my explicit disapproval when she originally proposed the idea.

1jj3l3t,WIBTA If I refused to pay a cat rescue for fixing my foster cats?,"Personally, I felt I was scammed by a rescue. Which is a statement I never thought I’d make, because usually I regard a rescue as a very honorable and respectable organization that only intends on helping. 

However, I ran into a particularly unfriendly rescue helper who responded to a post I had made requesting help with two kittens I had rescued from outside. (In AZ, where temps get up to about 120 degrees). 

I had mentioned in the posts that I am a young mom who just bought my house and cannot afford to spay/neuter them and if there’s anybody out there who could help me help them, to please reach out. 

She contacted me, asked me to explain why I felt that I needed the help, and then proceeded to ask me to bring the kittens for the procedure. I thanked her profusely, and she never mentioned once requiring that I pay her back.

She also blew up my phone the day of the procedure telling me I must call her back NOW or else she will not see the kittens, even though I had sent her a text message the night before letting her know that I would be there. 

Anyways, now that the kittens have found a new home she sent me an invoice saying that I owe her $120 for the spay/neuter. She charged me more for the male kitten than the quote I got at a local clinic, and I would have definitely declined her offer for “help” had I known she would charge me and at this price. 

So, WIBTA for ignoring her texts or reaching out to tell her I didn’t agree to pay her back at this price?

1jef5sa,AITA for not chipping in for my friend’s Uber after he felt uncomfortable sleeping at my place?,"I (26m) have been friends with Josh (26m) since college. We were basically inseparable then, but only stayed in touch intermittently since graduation. Recently he moved to NYC (where I live), and we have been hanging out like old times. 

Josh mainly comes near me because there's some bars we like to go to there. I've offered to go to his neighborhood (he lives in a different borough), but he says there's no fun places there. The only issue is he has to leave pretty early because the trains get wonky at night and Ubers are expensive. I've offered to let him crash, but he says he didn't want to be a burden. 

Anyway last Saturday Josh wanted to stay out and asked if he could crash. I told him of course. We went back to my studio (he knew it was a studio) and he asked if I had any pajamas he could borrow.

1jmw567,AITA for not consulting my sister-in-law to schedule my wedding in 15 months?,"AITA for not having my wedding based on my SIL's schedule?

I (26F) am a Canadian living in Germany, with my German fiancé (27M). We have been together for 6 years and we are planning our wedding to be in summer 2026.

My MIL & FIL are both doctors and my SIL (25F) is in med school. My family is from a regular middle class background, we are not doctors, we don't have fancy cars or expensive hobbies. My fiancé and I grew up very differently. My SIL has never had a full-time job, she drives a luxury German car, has her [second] horse, has all the latest Apple products, and her rent completely paid for by her parents.

My in-laws are completely estranged from their families — MIL doesn't talk to her siblings or parents, they ""kicked her out of the family"". My FIL also doesn't talk to his mom or his brother, claiming them to be toxic. Therefore, my fiancé has no ""real"" family in Germany except for his immediate family: mom, dad, sister, and by extension, the sister's boyfriend.

I have a big immigrant family in Canada and a lot of friends. Our international friends have all expressed enthusiasm to travel to Canada for the wedding. I moved to Germany to be with my partner. My partner and I are planning the wedding over 16 months in advance to (1) save up enough to pay for it ourselves and (2) ensure that all the people important to us can come. We know it is a big ask for our non-Canadian guests (mainly friends, as no family aside from the immediate were gonna be invited). Last week, we signed a venue contract to secure our date in July 2026. We mentioned to both our families that July was our target month as it's a beautiful time in Canada and after the FIFA World Cup.

After signing, we made a Save-the-Date graphic and sent it to our immediate families + closest friends (max. 10 people so far). My family was thrilled, my MIL's first response was: ""Why didn't you consult us and your sister first? That's during her exam season."" A few days later, my in-laws decided to cancel their stay with us (we live in different German cities) and said they are offended by our actions for not consulting them on the date and have now decided not to go to our wedding in Canada, to be in solidarity with their daughter, who may have an exam on that date. My SIL's exam schedule is not released until mid 2026. 

My partner and I are paying for this wedding ourselves. My in-laws are also threatening to ""kick my fiancé out of the family"" because we are ""selfish.""

My in-laws will be in town next week and want to set up an ""appointment"" to discuss this and how the ""family will move forward."" 

Are we the assholes in this? Should we change the date because my SIL *might* have an exam during this time? BTW the wedding date is on a Saturday and money is no issue to my in-laws. My partner and I are completely financially independent from both of our parents.

Basically, I told my family I wasn't going to drive Grandma to church on Sundays anymore. Reason being is because Grandma tries to use it as a matchmaking service for me. I really don't like the guys she tries to set me up with. 

I told her to stop it and that I wasn't going to take her if she keeps trying to set me up with her friends' relatives. Problem is that Grandma insists I stay with her, and I just want a day off to myself.

After last week, I told Grandma I had enough and that was the last time I take her. She and my mom are upset because she doesn't have another way to get to church. Mom can't drive and we don't have reliable public transportation.

So far, I've been holding my ground but Grandma is upset. Sunday is coming up and she's sad she won't get to attend. I told mom she needs to figure something out because I'm sick of being the unpaid chauffeur.

1j3lg3q,AITA for crashing out cause I’m not invited on the family holiday,"Hi guys (23F). My family recently booked a holiday and asked if I wanted to come I said I couldn’t afford it and that was that. Recently was talking to my mum and she said that both of my younger siblings are bringing a friend that she is fully paying for. My brother is 20 like he lives at home and she is paying for him and a friend. And my sister (15) and her friend to go on an all inclusive holiday to Spain. 

It was the same last year they all went on holiday without me but last year they didn’t bring anyone else. I was fine with it until I heard my mums paying for other kids to do but wouldn’t bring me so I’m annoyed with her. I do so much for her as well like way more than my other siblings. I live 10 mins down the road so always picking up/ dropping to school or doing things around the house for her but I’m butt hurt that she clearly had this extra money to spend to bring other peoples kids on holiday but not me. 

Am I the asshole? 

EDIT: I initially asked a few weeks ago for her to tell me how much it would be if I booked on cause I would have went if it was affordable. She got back to me saying it’s 900 and I just said I couldn’t afford that anyways and that was it. Until I found out she’s paying for 2 of my siblings friends. She said in convo who was going and I just said “what you could have paid for me to go but instead ur paying for 2 other children “ and she ignored that comment.

After my husband's surgery, his sisters decided to visit, and I welcomed them into our home. After their visit, I learned that they'd entered parts of our home that were not open to visitors, looked through things, and commented about its cleanliness.

For reference, I have a sibling that lives right down the road from them. Neither of them have aged well- they always refused to be active and have lived very sedentary lives in their retirement so aging has been hard on them. My father especially has struggled with type 2 diabetes and dementia/alzheimers. He is very combative and mean about everything, which is how he has always been, but dementia and old age has made it worse. He directs a lot of his anger towards me and is especially mad that I am trying to get them to move into assisted living because they fall constantly and need so much help. Anytime he disagrees with me about anything he starts screaming and calling me names including “ fat-a** and “the thing.” “The thing” hurts especially hard because I am his daughter and he is reducing me to something that is hardly human. He will say “ don’t look at the thing over there, she’s so ugly she might break your face” or just ridiculous stuff. He does this when he is completely lucid and remembering everything/everyone. Or he will say “ don’t feed the thing,” when my mom tries to offer me food. I tried so hard to ignore this treatment, but once he did it in front of my kids I put my foot down and stopped visiting. My mother now wants me to come to her 3+ times a week to help with cooking,cleaning, helping dress my father, etc. i have said no because the way he treats me is terrible and I have to look out for my own well being.

1jhkcwh,WIBTA if i don't pay entry for all the children coming to celebrate my sons 1st birthday,"Hi everyone, just looking for some perspective here on whether I'm the asshole or not.

So for context my son is turning one in June, which here in Australia is the middle of winter. We've been starting to organise his first birthday party. Unfortunately our house is not very big and we're unable to host his party here. We discussed holding it at a park in town, however we were worried about the weather. It tends to rain a lot where we are in winter.

Finally we settled on the children's indoor playground. We thought it was convenient and this way we didn't have to worry about the weather or supervision. 

Here's where I maybe the asshole. When talking to my friends about his party, I mentioned I'd be supplying all the food and drink; however I wouldn't be paying entry for all the children invited. My friend was surprised and said since the party was at an indoor playground, it was implied I'd be paying entry for all the children.
Now entry is not expensive, it's $6 per child. The issue is me and my husband both come from very big families and including the few friends my son has, we will be looking at between 20-30 children. Meaning it would cost us roughly $200 in entry fees for all the children. Plus the cost of food. 

My friend pointed out that $200 isn't a great deal of money and I agreed, however I've only recently returned to work from maternity leave and money is still tight. Also I felt as it was his first birthday and not an actual party package party (they host actual parties here for older children) it wasn't unreasonable that each family pays for their own child's entry.

My family and husband agree that it's fair everyone pays for their own children's entry, while we supply all food and drink

However now my friend has me second guessing.

So what do you think, AITA?",Tskye93,409,502,0.7599999904632568,0.1154714054227932,1742682253,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jhkcwh/wibta_if_i_dont_pay_entry_for_all_the_children/,2025,3,AmItheAsshole,2025-03-22 22:24:13
1jbhr1h,AITA for mistaking my girlfriends weight accidentally,"So I (21m) was driving with my girlfriend (20f) earlier tonight and we were talking about ideal protein intake based on your body weight (about 1.5 grams for kilogram of body weight)

She was saying how that would mean she needed like 150 grams per day, which by my mediocre on the spot math at the time meant that she was about 250 pounds. Which I didn’t believe for a second. My girlfriend is about 5’7 and looks to be a completely normal weight. 

That being said I remembered a few months ago that my girlfriend say that she stepped on the scale and told me that her weight in pounds started with a 2, which again I didn’t believe, as I assumed she was around the same weight as me, if not maybe a bit heavier (I’m 5’4 150lbs and she’s a bit taller than me so I figured it was around 160-170 for her at most) but she seemed pretty adamant that she was over 200 pounds, so I believed her even though it didn’t seem to add up to me.

Flash forward back to tonight. When she said she was 250 pounds, which I knew was an over exaggeration, I said “you’re obviously not 250 pounds, at most you’re like 190 (which again, I didn’t really believe but I was going off the number she’d given me a few months ago, minus a few pounds as I think she has lost a little weight since then).

What you need to know about my girlfriend is that she is VERY self conscious about her weight. Even though I think she has an incredibly attractive body, she always says how she’s “huge” and sometimes refuses to eat meals because of her fear of being overweight (I wouldn’t say she has an eating disorder, but she definitely does not have a healthy attitude towards her body and eating)

When I said that guess of 190, she got incredibly upset at me and started crying and asking for me to bring her home, and said that she couldn’t believe that I thought she was that heavy. I apologized and told her I was only going off the number she had given me a few months before, which she said she had been a joke (from my recollection there was nothing about her tone at that time that suggested it was a joke, even if I didn’t fully believe her.)

I apologized again, and told her that I didn’t really think she looked 190, and that I when she told me she was over 200 I didn’t really believe it but went along with it because a) I’ll be honest, I’m not that confident in myself when guessing peoples weight, and b) it is incredibly hard to know when my girlfriend is joking.

She rebuffed me and said that I should be good at guessing weights as I used to work at a gym, and she said that “it’s no wonder [I] got fired” (for the record, I wasn’t fired, I just got my shifts cut down for reasons out of my control).

I reassured her that she looks beautiful and doesn’t look overweight at all, and she seems to have calmed down now that we’ve gotten home. Still I just want to make sure that I wasn’t being a complete asshole to her, because I care a lot about her and try my best to support and reassure her about her body.

1jg2rbt,AITA for not letting my dad's gf walk through the front door that's in my room when she was upset?,"I (23m) live with my dad, his gf (when my dad hasn't kicked her out after one of their spats), and my youngest brother for the past 3 or 4 years. We recently moved into a new house around August of 2023 and my new room is like a mudroom but we only use it as a bedroom for me, but it has the front door which is fine bc my family only uses the back door really, and I can just grab whatever food or packages are delivered and distribute them.

Anyways, my dad's gf, let's call her Stacy (34f), and my dad always get into arguments when he's drunk. We have a small house so she has no where to go but outside when they argue or their closet. Well sometimes my dad is on the back porch drinking with my uncles and even though they will ignore her when she walks through them to go around the house to sit on the front steps, she would rather go through the front door.

Well since the front door is in my room, Stacy needs to ask since yknow, privacy and things and bc I would have to move a bunch of things and leave the door and screen door unlocked and open for her, and she always does ask.

I normally let her, but a few months ago, when this incident happens, she asks me and I said no, bc I just didn't want to have to move all my stuff and I was stressed and wanted to have personal convos with my friends without worrying she's snooping (she likes to eavesdrop and had stolen my sister's gf's things when my sis and her gf lived with us). Also, I have anxiety of leaving the front door unlocked and open (PTSD things) which increased with my stressed state. Anyways, when I said no, she cursed me out and said I was being inconsiderate before storming out of my room and almost slamming the door.

My friends said I wasn't an asshole and that it was my room so I have the right to say no and it's just my people pleasing personality making me feel guilty. Yet Stacy didn't talk to me for almost a month after, and our relationship is still strained. I'm internally torn.

1j1cv51,AITA for telling a family member off for purposely triggering my OCD?,"

Hello I am 23F and I had a disagreement with a family member 60M over an incident. I am living with them and overall we have a very good and supportive relationship, but something that happened today really upset me. I was diagnosed with OCD as a child and have been in therapy/on medication for it since. It’s something I’ve spent a lot of time working on and I’m very proud of the progress I have made. 



My OCD is about contamination/germs. My FM has known about my diagnosis since I got it and I have spent a lot of time talking to him about it. I even bought a book about living with someone with OCD as I know it can be difficult. He has been a huge supporter of my recovery even though he doesn’t fully understand it. 



However, today as I was making coffee I saw that he came out of the bathroom without washing his hands. I playfully gave him a hard time and encouraged him to wash his hands. He did and we both joked about it and it felt like it ended fine. 



Later, when I was making lunch he came out of the bathroom again without washing his hands. I could hear him approaching me and I asked if he washed his hands. He laughed and said no before wiping his hands on the sides of my sweatshirt and pants. I was so shocked I ran out of the room to go change. 



After, I came back down and said that I thought it was a mean thing to do and that it was very upsetting and that not washing your hands after using the restroom is inconsiderate as well as an immature habit to have at his age. He begrudgingly apologized, but acted like I was lecturing him for no reason. To be clear, I never raised my voice- I was definitely a bit stern but I felt it was necessary. 



While I don’t expect him to keep track of all my triggers I feel like that is something that would upset anyone- OCD or no OCD. Especially within hours of our first conversation about the importance of washing hands after using the restroom. 



AITA for lecturing him about doing something he knew would be upsetting?

He invited me to go to dinner with his family and I accepted, but he casually mentioned, “Maybe you could wear something with sleeves? Just so we don’t start any drama.” I asked what he meant, and he said his grandparents are very old-school and might not react well to my tattoos. He said he didn’t want the night to be awkward.  
I told him I wasn’t going to hide part of myself to make his family more comfortable. He said it’s not about hiding, it’s about respect. I told him respect goes both ways, and I shouldn’t have to pretend to be someone I’m not.  
He got upset and said I was overreacting and making it a bigger deal than it is. I told him that I would go to the dinner but that I wouldn't cover my tattoos. But then he asked me to please not attend, that if I was only going to be difficult, it would be better not to be there.  
That really rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel confused, because I think maybe I did behave badly and I shouldn't have reacted so vehemently against the idea.

I a few weeks ago was at a greenhouse buying some plants for the garden and I saw two yard flamingos marked down on clearance. I knew they belonged in my garden. They’re not everyone’s cup of tea, but I think they’re a lot of fun. 

I set them up when I got home and a couple days later my neighbor was knocking on my door. She was demanding I take down my flamingos because they’re “extremely gauche” and “lowering the property value of the neighborhood”. I told her I am not taking them down because I like them, and the property value isn’t going to be hurt by two yard flamingos. I also don’t live in an HOA and as far as I am aware, there are no town ordinances about yard flamingos lol

She has posted pictures of my house, the street I live on, and a close up of my flamingos in our towns Facebook group to complain about them. Some people agreed I should take them down. After that, another neighbor came over to tell me to get rid of them. My mom also agreed I should take them down to keep the peace with my neighbor.

1jzb2tl,AITA - told mom she can bill me using the tuition money she stole from me,"When I (m33) was preparing to go to uni, my mom confessed that there was no tuition money for me. Through the years my dad would give her cash to deposit but she only did the first one. She spent the rest. TBH I wasn't even surprised. I was used to being disappointed by her. She promised that she would ""pay me back"" and asked that I never tell me dad. So for four years I thanked them for the tuition money while I took out loans.

For reasons to do with her narcissism, I have an arms length relationship with her, but she would say we're pretty close as she assumes my smiling and nodding while she drones on about the same stories is a relationship.

We have a family cottage that she puts above everything else. She lives there about 90 days of the year. I've been going there with my gf for about 4 days for a couple summers which she begrudges as it takes away from her time. My dad supports my going which is how I pull it off. 

She recently told me that it was time for me to start paying for some of the maintenance on the cottage since I use it. She actually suggested 1k which is wildly disproportionate. I told her she could take it out of the tuition IOU and we could negotiate the amount with dad.

She was speechless. She texted me later to say that it manipulative to bring up the tuition and to threaten to tell dad. It went on and on. 

I've been thinking about it and First, I'm hurt/offended that she can't just do a nice thing for me, she has to get something for it. 
Second, I guess I'm not really over the whole tuition thing. 

WITAH for bringing up ancient history and not paying her for use of the cottage?

We aren't exactly flamboyant or outwardly 'gay' and don't exactly do PDA since that's how we were raised. On my lunch break from work I like to visit my husband bringing him records I think he might like and his coffee. Recently however Joe has started making comments. It started small with him saying things about'queer joy' and how he loves gay couples which we didn't mind at all, in all fairness it's a fairly scary world for queer people right now and I understand seeing a happy married gay couple means a lot for a kid. But then he started getting a little too comfortable for my liking. He started asking things like 'whose the top' and calling us the f slur jokingly. I think it's entirely inappropriate to be making those comments to his boss but my husband told me to let it go. Joe calls us the f slur a lot which I had brought up a few times telling him calmly to not do that but when he continued I learnt to let go despite my distaste for it since it didnt seem to bother my husband too much but last Wednesday I lost it. 
I was up by the counter when Joe came in. He immediately started blathering on about how f---y we are and while my husband chuckled awkwardly,I did not. Joe noticed this and said I was a stick in the mud and repressed. I was trying to keep my cool until he called me 'a fenian f---t' and I lost it. For anyone who doesn't know the term 'Fenian' isnt exactly a slur or anything but it isn't exactly nice either. Me and my husband jokingly call each other fenians or paddy's from time to time if weve something particularly 'Irish' and I've never exactly viewed as a very offensive word to me but something about this English boy made me snap. I asked him if he thought that was an appropriate thing to say to his boss's partner and started shouting. Telling him hes way out of play and if he wants to keep his job he should buck up. I left to cool down a bit and 30 minutes later got a call from my husband berating me saying that Joe was crying and that hes just a kid. I do feel really bad since hes only young but I still think he needed to be knocked down a step or two, am I the asshole?

Edit: I see a lot of people making comments about the nature of the relationship between Joe and my husband, my husband has asked Joe to stop on my behalf before but this isn't something that really bothers my husband and to be fair it's his workplace not mine.


Update: Joe is my husbands son.
I won't go too much into the details for both my and their privacy but I had a major fight with my husband about why he was being so lenient with him and why we didn't have my back in this. We were shouting back and forth until he shouted something about 'blood being thicker than water' I shout back about him being just some boy and he stopped suddenly. Then he told me. Joe is from an ex girlfriend of his whose now unable to take care of him so my husband picked up. He's been playing child support for years. We each have our separate bank account so I didn't even notice. I'm contemplating separation and divorce. Someone I've known for 25 years became a stranger in 10 seconds. 
I physically got sick thinking back on those sexual remarks that he made to his FATHER. My husband alsways went white as a ghost when he said those kinds of things and that was possibly the only thung he actually gave out to him for but it makes me feel sick all the same",Adventurous-Dog-5299,6544,962,0.8999999761581421,0.3787156219677181,1744586124,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jyksrp/aita_for_yelling_at_a_19_year_old_and_asking_for/,2025,4,AmItheAsshole,2025-04-13 23:15:24
1k6aqqe,AITA for sitting on a woman’s purse on the train?,"I live in a metropolitan city and the train I take home from work is crowded since everyone is also getting off work. There have been many occasions where other passengers on the train will occupy the empty seat next to them with their bag. There are people standing during the ride when there are available seats. 

I walked multiple cars to try to find an empty seat (without a bag) but couldn’t. The last car I went to I asked this woman if I could sit there and she pretended to not hear me. I didn’t want to tap her shoulder because you never know how people would react so I waved a bit to get her attention and she said she didn’t want to hold her bag (which was a no). I told her I couldn’t find any other empty seat and I had already walked the entire train and it’s leaving soon. She ignored me again. I asked if she could move her bag and she still ignored me. I ended up just sitting in the seat on her purse. 

She began yelling at me telling me I’m a b!tch and told me to move because she never said I could sit there. I told her that there was no other seat and the train was departing. She began pushing me to move and the conductor luckily came by them and told her to relax. She told him that I touched her purse and he asked if it was occupying a seat and she didn’t reply. He ended up telling her to be considerate and left to check tickets. 

When the train stop came she said she’s going to report me to the police for touching her belongings and said I’m inconsiderate for invaliding her personal space because she had a rough day at work and wanted personal space. I told her that it was still inconsiderate when many people are looking for seats. She said they should’ve been there early enough go get empty seats (this was 9 minutes before departure). 

I’m a woman for reference so it’s not like she was simply uncomfortable sitting next to a man. ",CyclingSkater,6663,728,0.9399999976158142,0.3463923126915552,1745443190,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k6aqqe/aita_for_sitting_on_a_womans_purse_on_the_train/,2025,4,AmItheAsshole,2025-04-23 21:19:50
1k9gy15,AITA for not eating the birthday cake my boyfriend got me?,"  Alright so my birthday was a couple days ago and I asked my boyfriend like a week before to get me a carrot cake. While I know its not a popular choice for a birthday cake, it's my favourite and practically the only flavour of cake I like (besides red velvet but I wasnt feeling it tbh.) Keeping in mind that I was gonna have a birthday party with my friends, my boyfriend suggested that I get a ""flavour that people like"", which I'd understand maybe if it was a huge party with tons of people, but I know my friends and I know they wouldn't  mind carrot cake at all. 

  Anyways fast forward to my birthday, my boyfriend goes and gets the cake from the shop in the afternoon and I dont get to see it since im getting ready, but he doesn't mention anything to me about it, so i think nothing of it since i like a surprise. My friends arrive and everything's going great until its time for the cake to be served. We gather around the table and everyone sings happy birthday while my boyfriend brings out the cake, and to my horror, i see this big chocolate cake in his hands. I hate chocolate cake. It makes me sick. He KNOWS I hate chocolate cake. 

  My face fell when I saw it but I obvs didnt say anything at the time. However, I did give my bf a glare or two, which he clearly picked up on since he kept insisting I eat the cake infront of everyone as we were serving it out. Something about that made me angry in the moment and I refused to try the cake at all. I cut it, i blew out the candles, I handed it out to eberyone, but i didn't try it myself. 

  I dont think the others took huge notice but once the party ended i started getting unready when my boyfriend comes into our room and is lile ""why do you have to act like a child all the time??"" And im like what the hell and hes like ""you have to make a scene just cos i didn't get your fucking carrot cake"" and he went on about how nobody likes carrot cake and how im spoiled and selfish and looked stupid not eating cake at my own birthday and then claimed he couldnt find carrot cake which is crazy cos 1. Ive never not gone to that shop and NOT seen carrot cake, and 2. even if there wasnt any he coulda picked ANY other flavour, besides the only one I hate. 

 I told him that and he just got really upset like I was the one who started the fight and started going on abt how I was overreacting over cake and how he tried his best to make this bday good for me (which in fairness is true since he put a lot of effort into organising it for me) but honestly I was just livid then. Now we're still kinda off about it and neither of us have lile apologised or anything but im starting to think i did overreact over cake and I probably shoulda just eaten it and then talked tochim later but idk 😭

1k8ox5z,AITA for not picking the restaurant my cousin wanted?,"I (25f) just recently received a great promotion at work and I’m really excited about it. Because of this I decided to invite some family out to dinner to celebrate. I chose a steakhouse and when my cousin, Aria (32f) found out it was a steakhouse called me to let me know that I had to pick a different restaurant. When I asked why she explained it was because she was vegan, gluten-free, and also has a few allergies and couldn’t trust that they wouldn’t cross-contaminate her food. I explained to her that there were vegan and gluten free options and we could let the restaurant know of her allergies so everything would be fine. She refused saying it doesn’t make a difference and told me if I don’t pick a different restaurant she wouldn’t attend and hung up.


This has happened in the past as well, whenever I want to go out to a restaurant whether it’s for an event or a birthday she has an issue with it and has been doing this since I was younger. I remember when I turned 16 she told my parents that I had picked a restaurant she couldn’t eat at. Because of this my parents let her pick where we went for my birthday and she picked one of my least favourite restaurants and I had no fun. 

To be honest, I don’t really care if she attends or not so I texted her and let her know that I wouldn’t be changing the restaurant. Because of this shes been going absolutely feral and texting others to not attend because I’m being inconsiderate. I’ve been asked if maybe I can change the restaurant for her preferences but I denied.

1jvjdip,AITA for refusing to be my sister’s bridesmaid because she chose “ugly friends” to make herself look better?,"My sister (27F) is getting married and asked me (24F) to be one of her bridesmaids. I was excited — until I found out who the rest of the bridal party was. Every single one of them is someone she’s either not that close to, or has made fun of before for being “awkward” or “not photogenic.” Some of her actual best friends — the ones who she sees all the time — weren’t even asked.

It felt weird, so I asked her why she picked this group. She kind of laughed and said, “You’ll understand when it’s your wedding. You don’t want people who’ll outshine you in your own pictures.”

I just stared at her. I asked, “So you picked them because you think they’ll make you look better?” She rolled her eyes and said, “It’s not that deep. I just want to feel confident that day, and I’m allowed to be a little selfish for my wedding.”

That rubbed me the wrong way. I told her I didn’t want to be part of a bridal party built on tearing other people down — even subtly — and that she should’ve picked people she actually cares about.

Now she’s calling me judgmental and sensitive, and our mom says I’m being “too idealistic” and should just support her. But I feel like going along with it makes me complicit.

I go on business trips for work around 3-4 times a year. In a week I'm going to Florida. My wife and I decided to make this one a trip for our family, we figured it would be perfect staying in a resort with pools and things to do for my wife and Daughter’s while I work then in the evening we can do stuff together. Of course K will have to miss a week of school, we are getting her school work for the week so she can work on it while gone. 

Yesterday I was talking on the phone with my mom. I had told her about my business trip and how I my wife and daughter’s were going. She mentioned something about K staying with her. I asked what she was talking about. She said K has to stay with her since we’ll be gone for a week. I told her no, K is coming with. She argued that she has school I told her its a trip and memories, she’ll always remember. Unlike a 4th grade spelling test. My mom got really upset with me, said It's not good to let K miss so much school. The only other time she missed school this year was 2 sick days. I don't think its smart to constantly let her miss school but going on a trip with her family and missing a little school isn't the end of the world. 

My mom said I'm setting K  up for failure, I told her its the 4th grade. Plus she  would feel so left out If everyone went but her. My mom called me an AH and said I'm not the son she raised.

1k7znn0,AITA for not inviting my nephew to my sons birthday party?,"I (35f) have a son, Cillian (14m) who just recently had a birthday. The issue stems from his birthday from last year, where we invited all his cousins and his friends to celebrate him. The party went great for the first half, but when it came time to cut the cake I went over to fridge to go get it and saw it was half eaten. I was obviously upset about this because this had been a cake that I had made by a professional baker that cost me around $140 and my son really loved the design.

I asked who ate the cake and my sister (44f) laughed it off when her son, Robbie, (16m) told her that he ate the cake because he was hungry. To be clear the cake wasn’t the only food at the party, throughout the party we served many different dishes such as wings, veggie platters, pizzas, chips, and sodas. I was obviously angry that my son couldn’t have his cake and had to quickly go out and by one from Walmart. I’m honestly still shocked that with all the food at the party Robbie still managed to clear half of a huge cake, it was enough to produce about 20 slices.

I called my sister later to tell her I wasn’t happy with what her son had done and since I had spent so much money on the cake I expected it back. She then accused me of being fat phobic which absolutely is not true, I have never once discriminated against Robbie at any time, this was just a false accusation. To explain, Robbie has a weight problem and has been having issues with binging since he was around 13 which is why he is about 250 pounds and my sister has never failed to let anyone know of that and expects for everyone to bend over backwards for Robbie since he has it hard. 

This year Cillian wanted to have a friends only party with the exception of 2 cousins, one that only his friends and closest cousins could come to since he hated his party from last year. I asked why and he explained to me that he was embarrassed of Robbie since all he did was poke fun at his friends and him, bring his own uninvited plus one, and obviously he ate some of the cake. 

I complied and only invited his friends and allowed 2 of his cousins to join as well. Luckily some of my siblings were understanding, the only one who had an issue with this was my sister. She called me to ask why Robbie wasn’t invited and I explained to her that Cillian doesn’t want him there because of what he did last year, my sister was infuriated and said she knew we had an issue with her sons weight. Since then she has been ranting all over Facebook and I’ve been getting calls from relatives and this entire situation has been stressing me out.

1k6bxmx,AITA for snapping at my mom after she tried to force me to learn sign language?,"My (13M) mom (35F) has been dating with her now fiancé (38M) (let’s call him Jeremy) for two years. Five months ago he proposed her and they got engaged, and moved in together, and now they are planning their wedding. I am cool with this. I really like Jeremy, they were friends before they started dating, so I met and got close to him before he started dating my mom. I think he’s really cool and I am happy for my mom. 

My issue is with his annoying and arrogant son, he is only 2 years older than me but acts like he’s too cool to hang out with me. He treats me like a little kid but there’s only 2 years between us.

I will call him Dean. Dean is deaf, and has to use a device (it’s called cochlear implants) to hear. But he can’t wear his device all the time because apparently hearing can be exhausting for him. Tbh I think this is an excuse he uses to avoid hanging out with us. But that’s what he claims. 

Anyway he and Jeremy both know sign language but my mom and I don’t. My mom has started learning after she got engaged with Jeremy and she’s pressuring me to learn too but I’m refusing because i don’t want to spend my time learning a whole language for him when he clearly doesn’t even like me. 

My mom says I am being disrespectful because we now basically live semi together. (He comes to stay with Jeremy on the weekends. I live with my mom full time. So unfortunately I have to stay with Dean on weekends)

1jxqsks,"AITA for not inviting my dad’s partner to my micro “wedding” dinner, and for not reaching out to her first to explain why?","Using a throwaway to not connect this to my main.

My partner and I are getting married this summer, and we’ve decided to essentially elope. We’re going to have a private ceremony just the two of us during our honeymoon. Not only does this align very much with who we are, so no one in our life is very surprised by this, but we’re also doing it because: 1. our families live scattered across the world and a larger event would mean leaving a lot of people out, and 2. We want to avoid drama.

However, what we do want to do is get dressed up, take photos, and have a dinner together with our immediate families. So essentially, a micro non-wedding celebration. This is where the issues start.

So I told my parents I wanted to have this small event with just them, my partner, and my sister (not including their “new” partners). My parents went through a nasty divorce when I was in my teens, and for several reasons that I explained to them I wanted an intimate event just the five of us. My mom was fully supportive, saying she can understand why this would be so meaningful for me.

My dad understood too. But he wanted me to be the one to break the news to his partner (54F). I didn’t think I had to, because it’s not like I’m calling everyone single other family member who isn’t invited to explain this decision. But I said that if she’s upset she’s more than welcome to call me and we can talk about it. His partner is very sensitive, and we’ve clashed a lot over the years because I don’t think she’s ever been fully willing to understand the nuances of coming into a family after a divorce. Their relationship started shortly after the divorce, and she tried to parent both my sister and I (who were teens/pre-teens) from the get-go. But even though we’re not close, I’ve done my best to otherwise be welcoming and kind.

Well, now he’s told her and all hell has broken lose. She’s completely beside herself, and he wants me to mitigate the issue and reach out. I’ve reiterated that she’s free to call me - if she can’t possibly understand why this is about me and not her (and I can understand she’s disappointed, but so is, I assume, everyone else) then she should reach out to me.

AITA for not inviting her, and for not breaking the news to her, and for refusing to be the first person to reach out here to resolve this? I can kind of see my dad's point, who says I should be extra mindful of her since she is a sensitive person who has had a hard time accepting we're not very close and takes this personally. However, at the same time, I don't think I'm responsible for her feelings or for cleaning up this 'mess.' I also believe in the idea of “my wedding, my choice.”",Powerful-Bug-7639,3636,905,0.9200000166893004,0.2681860296208475,1744490260,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jxqsks/aita_for_not_inviting_my_dads_partner_to_my_micro/,2025,4,AmItheAsshole,2025-04-12 20:37:40
1k5hmpj,WIBTA for telling my boyfriend's parents I'm not his babysitter?,"I 23f have been dating my boyfriend Josh 29m for 2 years. We live together as well. Recently, his parents have started asking me to get him to do things. ""Make sure Josh to go to the dentist for his cracked tooth."" or ""Make sure Josh updates his passport."" or ""Make sure Josh changes his pet food for his cat. We don't like the brand."" Or ""Make sure Josh does his taxes. You may need to sit with him and help."" The most recent has been convincing Josh to get a new job in an entirely unrelated field because Josh's parents don't feel like he makes enough money. (Josh makes 70k, I make 110k so we are doing fine.)  

Typically I respond with some variation of ""I'm fully capable Josh can figure it out himself, and if not, it will be a good learning experience for him."" but that hasn't stopped Josh's parents. Now I'm planning on being a little harsher and telling them I'm not Josh's babysitter and to leave me out of these concerns.

My husband wanted to come along even though I told him it could be just a girls night with my daughter and I. He insisted on going because he didn't want us to be out late by ourselves, even though he does not care for Megan's music.

So my daughter and I enjoy the concert so much! She was so excited she almost cried from pure joy. Everything was great, concert ended, we go to our vehicle.

My daughter and I are still having a good time, kind of on a post-concert high. I turn one of Megan moroney's songs on and we start singing along. My husband abruptly turns it off. At first I thought, ok maybe he just wants some peace as he drives but he says ""turn it on something else!"" I said ""why, we were listening to that?"" He said ""well I don't want to"" or someone like that and starts complaining about how awful megan moroney is and how her songs are all man-bashing, etc. I said ""whoa buddy we told you that it could just be a girls night like you insisted on coming!"" So we ride home in silence and my daughter is really disappointing. One of our favorite things to do is turn the music on and sing along in the car.

1kbt483,AITA for winning my mom’s storage unit at auction instead of giving her the money to save it herself?,"I (24F) was in and out of the foster care system. My mom would lose custody of me and my three siblings, only to do the bare minimum to get us back, just for the cycle to repeat. I eventually aged out of foster care, went to college, and moved to another state. I still check in with my mom every week. She was diagnosed with heart failure. (which came on from other terrible decisions). I offer support when she reaches out, whether it's with money, food etc. Most of the time I don't hear back. And when I do, it's usually because she wants something. She has a long history of lying to and stealing from all of us. She's currently homeless. We have offered her a place to stay if she gets clean and she wont. After we turned 18, we reconnected with our extended family, grandparents, and cousins, and those relationships have become important to us. A couple of months ago, she called me in a panic at 2:00 in the morning. She said her storage units were about to be auctioned off, that she wasn't even behind on payments, and that the owners were trying to scam her.
She needed $1,000 immediately because there were only 15 hours left before the auction. I told her l'd check in the morning once I got to work and see what I could do. The next day, I did some digging and looked at the contents of the storage units. What was listed broke my heart: family photos, vases from great-grandparents, personal documents (birth certificates, Social Security cards, my mom's clothing and tools, and everything from my grandmother's house (she passed away just last year). I decided to bid on the unit myself and ended up spending nearly $1,200 for it. Afterward, I spoke to the owners, who told me they'd been trying to help my mom for months: discounts, payment extensions etc. But eventually, she just stopped answering them. They said they had no other option but to auction it. I was devastated. My siblings said that if I hadn't stepped in, all of those memories and important documents would've ended up in a stranger's hands. My siblings were relieved and grateful... but my mom? She accused me of violating her trust, told me l ""emotionally robbed her"" , that I stole from her, and said I was a mistake. She even claimed our grandparents would be ashamed of me. I ended up taking a few days off work, drove out of state to the unit, and went through everything. I only kept what belonged to me and my siblings-photos, documents, anything tied to our family history. I didn't throw away a single item of hers.

1kb0w6d,AITAH for telling my grandma she can’t wear blue at my wedding?,"PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE THING!

My (24F) fiance (25M) are getting married in June and we’ve invited our families, obviously. The colors we chose are light blue, tan, and navy blue. For a little bit of context, my parents went through a horrible divorce when I was 13. My dad’s mom (the grandma I’m talking about) was VERY hateful to my mom and just outright disrespectful to her so I’m not her biggest fan. She’s always gone against the rules and done whatever she’s wanted to with no repercussions. She enables my dad who is an addict and she knows it’s wrong (not important but just trying to set the scene). It’s a little awkward going to family gatherings on my dad’s side because I feel like the black sheep of the family. My sister (33F) is my half sister on my dad’s side, we’ve become closer through the years. 
My grandma called me about 2pm today and we talked about wedding stuff and she asked me what I wanted her to wear. I told her I wasn’t picky, just no white and no light blue. 

Later today, my sister and my grandma went to JCPenny to shop. My sister found a dress she loved, it’s also important to note my sister is a bridesmaid in my wedding. They are wearing light blue. My grandma sees the dress and loves it as well saying it would be perfect for the wedding. However, she meant for herself. Not for my sister. My grandma bought a light blue (almost white) dress to wear to our wedding. My sister told me about it, as she thought my grandma had bought the dress for her and didn’t realize that she bought it for herself (my sister is not the brightest bulb in the box), and my grandma picked the dress when my sister walked away from it because it was too expensive for her to buy for herself. I know this is my grandma, it’s not that deep, but it does upset me she chose a color I specifically asked her to not wear as my wedding party is wearing that color. Since she has a habit of going against the rules and wearing whatever she wants, this doesn’t surprise me. We have recently thought she has been having some memory problems, but I’m not sure. I haven’t confronted her yet but I plan to. I just don’t know if I’m being an asshole by confronting her. TIA!

1jq03wh,AITA for chasing someone down to stop letting their dog use my yard as a bathroom?,"I've (35M) got a freshly remodeled front yard that looks really good. Its about a month old.  
[Think something similar to this.](https://www.needforbuild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Landscape-Design-Landscape-Design-Clairemont-CA-Need-For-Build-Inc-768x576.jpg)

Our old front yard was a grass yard.  We regularly had issues with people letting their pets shit and piss.  Shit was mostly picked up, but our yard reeked of piss when it was hot out.  I put up a ""be respectful no poop or pee signs"", they are still up post remodel. 
  
Finally, my wife and I bit the bullet to remodel the yard.  Now the first 5 feet of the yard next to the sidewalk is rock, and we were hoping that would deter people from letting their dog in our yard.  It doesn't seem like it has.  It is still a noticeable issue to our noses. 
 
This morning, my wife (27F) pointed out someone (30's F) letting their dog go to the bathroom in our yard.  As soon as I saw this I headed for the door and by the time I got outside she was in front of my neighbors yard. I walked her way and yelled at her not to let her dog piss and shit in my yard.  

I pointed out the signs.  She said if her dog has to go, her dog has to go.  She says, i don't know why you are complaining, I cleaned it up.  I was like, ""Not the Piss"".  She was giving me big attitude.  I yelled at her to teach her dog to piss and shit at home.  She told me ""shut up asshole"" and called me a bully.  As she continued walking away I said my yard is not for your dog.  AITA?",SpareTip6703,1049,1035,0.8199999928474426,0.1980312639676381,1743628602,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jq03wh/aita_for_chasing_someone_down_to_stop_letting/,2025,4,AmItheAsshole,2025-04-02 21:16:42
1kb1xx9,AITA for wearing underwear to sleep,"For contexts I am a male who lives with my parents and siblings. I live in the southern part of the US and it is starting to get hot again and as a result I’ve started to go to sleep only wearing a pair of boxers. I’ve done this for most of my life and have never had a problem until this morning. The reason why I might be the asshole is because today my brother and his girlfriend walked into my room with zero warning to wake me up. I don’t know what he expected to see and why he would bring his girlfriend in the room too but I woke up to them walking in and like any other healthy dude I was rock hard. I realized and immediately tried to cover up but the damage was already done. My brother turned his girl around and told her to go wait downstairs. He then proceeds to get mad at me for being hard. I tried to tell him that it’s normal and he should have expected me to not be wearing much since it’s a normal thing for me and my other brothers to wear as little as possible when sleeping but he would not calm down. So now I’m being forced to wear pants while I sleep because he told my dad and he agrees with my brother. I personally don’t even think it’s much of a problem.

1jx3t03,AITA for going out to eat when my husband is working late shifts?,"My husband and I work different shifts. I worked first shift and he works a late second shift. So we don’t often eat dinner together because he leaves for work right before I get home and he gets home from work after I am asleep. 

We also have very different tastes in foods. He has a more basic, American food based diet and he also loves seafood. I love foods from other cultures, but I don’t like seafood. Because of this, when we are home together we cook different meals and eat it together. If I make something he likes, I’ll ask if he wants some. If he makes something I like, he does the same. But we always eat together on our days off, whether it be eating out on a date or eating cooked food at home. We’ve been doing this for years and it’s worked. 

But since we work different shifts, 5 to 6 days per week, I am eating dinner alone. I usually cook, but a couple times per month, I go out to a restaurant that serves food he doesn’t like to have dinner. When we are talking later, I usually tell him how I had something from a restaurant and he asks how it was and I tell him. No biggie. 

The other day I was out trying a Peruvian restaurant recommended by a coworker. My husband and I had looked at the menu and he didn’t see anything he was particularly looking forward to on it, so I added it to my list of places to go when he works. And I went that day. He got out of work early and called me and I told him where I was. And he got mad. 

I finished up and went home and he was upset and asked how long this has been going on for. I was confused because he knows I do this. But apparently he thought I did pickup or delivery. I tend to eat in because I don’t want dishes at home. He also can’t really explain why he is so mad, but it seems he’s mad I’m out dining alone? I just go out, get food, and read while I wait and eat. Then I come home. It’s always food he won’t like as well, so I go alone so I can have it. 

He hasn’t been really talking to me since it happened. The conversations are short and cold and it makes me feel like I did something wrong by doing this for years and not specifying I eat in the restaurant to do it. He has never acted this way about anything else, he has always been very kind and willing to work through any issues we have. So I am not sure what’s different with this. 

AITA for going out to eat alone and not specifying to my husband that I ate in the restaurant?

1k9i2j5,AITA for not letting my brother's girlfriend have one of my cupcakes??,"ok so like last weekend my mom threw a little family get together at our house cause it was her bday. nothing crazy, just cousins and stuff. i decided to bake cupcakes the night before (i'm not a professional baker or anything but they came out super good tbh).

anyways i made like 24 cupcakes and put them out on a tray on the counter. i specifically told everyone that they were for after dinner because my mom wanted to do a candle thing with them instead of a regular cake.

so my brother (he’s 22) shows up with his girlfriend, who nobody really knows that well cause they been dating for like 2 months? she’s nice i guess but a little pushy. like she acts like she’s already part of the family or whatever. idk.

fast forward, we're all just hanging out and i see her just straight up grabbing a cupcake off the tray. i go over and i’m like ""hey can you pls wait till after dinner? my mom wants to do candles with them"" and she kinda just stares at me like im crazy and goes “it’s just one.”

i said ""yeah but they're for later"" and she literally rolled her eyes at me and put it back... after taking a BITE. so now that one’s ruined obviously.

my brother got mad and pulled me aside later saying i was rude and made her feel unwelcome and ""it’s not a big deal"" but like?? it wasnt just about the cupcake, it was about the whole plan.

my mom said i didn’t do anything wrong but some of my cousins said i shoulda just let it go cause ""family first"" and now my brother’s still being weird with me.

1jq0f1m,AITA for leaving the house when I found out my wife invited her mom on our vacation?,"I (28M) have always had a rocky relationship with my wife's mom. She’s overbearing, constantly inserting herself into our lives, and doesn’t respect boundaries. Any time I try to set limits, she either ignores them or acts like I’m being unfair.

My wife and I planned a two week vacation just the two of us. I saved up and handled all the planning, while she was in charge of booking the flights. Her mom caught wind of the trip and immediately started pushing to come along. I told my wife no I wanted this to be a trip for us, not a family getaway. Her mom threw a tantrum, called, texted, and even got other relatives to pressure me. My wife tried to convince me to let her come, but I refused. She eventually agreed and said she wouldn’t invite her.

The night before we were supposed to leave, I was double-checking our travel plans when I noticed an extra ticket on the reservation—her mom’s name was on it. I confronted my wife, and she admitted she booked it behind my back, hoping I’d ""just go along with it"" once it was already done.

I was furious. Instead of arguing, I packed a bag—not for the trip, but to leave. I told her if she wanted to vacation with her mom so badly, she could, but I wasn’t going. She started crying, saying I was ""ruining everything"" and that since the ticket was already bought, I should just deal with it. I walked out and went to stay at a friend’s place for a few days to clear my head.

Now, she’s been calling me nonstop, saying I overreacted and made her look bad. She even told our families, and some of them think I should’ve just gone and ""made the best of it"" instead of ""wasting money"" and causing drama.

1jt7ogm,AITA for not buying my stepdaughter a new car after she's repeatedly gotten into accidents?,"My step daughter is not a good driver. She was not a good driver when she was a teen and certainly not as an adult. When she was first learning to drive, she did very fast hard breaks, she repeatedly left her car's lights on or left her car unlocked.

When she first got her permit at 16, we gave her two rules. We would help buy her first car but she'd be on her own for car insurance, gas, and up keep. If she wanted a car, she needed to be the sole caretaker of it and it was on her to ensure she was taking good care of it. Her brothers had the same rules.

3 months into her being 17, she got in her first accident. It was her first time driving in the ice and she slid. Her car hit another car. It was not a serious accident, but it caused roughly 1k in damages. Her car drove for another 2 months, but the transmission went out eventually. She bought it at 160-ishk miles so none of us were surprised it didn't last very long.

When she was 19, she was in another car accident. While on the highway, a semi-truck tried to merge wile riding next to her, she sped up and during it, another car tried to merge right as she sped up. The car was totaled. Outside of wiplash and minor wrist injuries, she was okay. Because of this accident, we made her get her own insurance because our payment went up.

Three weeks ago, she was involved in another accident. Again on the highway, she was passing an on ramp and a car coming on hydroplanned and lost control of a ladder in the back of it's pick up truck. It again totaled her car: it could not leave the scene and we had to get her to bring her back to her college. The other driver broke his collarbone and she has wiplash, a shoulder injury, and some facial damage that should heal in the next bit. The police officer told her that it was not her fault, but obviously we have to wait for the insurance to make that call.

Once she got home from the ER, she asked for us to help her purchase a new car. She said that it's not practical for her to constantly walk everywhere until she could afford a new car. She makes $21 an hour as a CMA at a nursing home so it won't take her long to buy a cheap car. From her apartment, she is about 1.5 miles from college, .25 miles from a grocery store, and 4 miles from her job. I think for the time being, she can walk, ask for rides from friends, or use an app. We don't have public transportation, but lots of side walks. She can walk the entirety from her apartment to class, most to a store, and on and off from her job.

My husband wants us to purchase a new car and have her pay us back. I don't think this is the right move. To date, the only time we have ever helped buy a car is when they all started driving, and we only paid half. She only saved 2k for her first car, so we only gave 4k for a new car. One of her brothers saved up 10k, so we gave 10k. If we start doing this now, we will walk down a very expensive walk.

I have gotten mixed reactions from others.

1k1q1zp,AITA for setting boundaries with my sister during her pregnancy?,"
Hi all,
I (19s, F) have a older sister who is pregnant with her second child. She has a 1.5-year-old son. During her first pregnancy, I supported her a lot because her husband was working full-time. I was happy to do it at the time.

This time, her husband is studying from home and is present all day. Still, she frequently asks me for help—running errands, watching her toddler after I finish work, etc. I’ve suggested they consider part-time daycare to give her a break, but she insists her son is too young and that I should help.

Recently, she told me she expects me to care for her toddler for the entire first month after the baby is born, so she and her husband can focus on the newborn. I told her I’m exhausted after work and that since her husband is home, he should be more involved.

What’s been hard is that when I do help, she often tells our mom that I’m not doing enough. Then I get scolded by our mom, which makes me feel unappreciated and guilty.

I care about my sister, but I feel like she’s assuming I’ll always be available, without considering my own limits. I’m starting to feel emotionally drained and like my efforts aren’t respected.

So, AITA for saying no and establishing limits even though she’s pregnant?",Internal_Path8845,2326,346,0.9700000286102296,0.1352447410837901,1744930250,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k1q1zp/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_sister_during/,2025,4,AmItheAsshole,2025-04-17 22:50:50
1jyl4nr,AITA for insisting that our baby takes my (25F) surname instead of my fiance's (26M)?,"Me (25F) and my fiance Arjun (26M) are currently 5 months along in our pregnancy with our unexpected, but very welcome, first child, a daughter. Relevant to the story, I am white british and he is of Indian descent (3rd gen in UK). This is a throwaway as I don’t want this to be linked to my actual account.

We met 6 years ago at University on a group project, where we were sorted alphabetically by surname and the rest is history. Obviously, I’m not going to put our actual surnames on the internet, but they are both 3 or more syllables and begin and end with the same letter/sound. For the sake of the post, say his is Mukherjee and mine is Mulvaney.

We have decided our daughter’s first and middle names and are looking at the surname situation, which has been heated. I have always been resolute in keeping my surname, and while I always thought I would double barrel any kid’s names, given the similarity and length of our surnames, we both agree it would be really unfair for the kid as it would be a tongue twister that she would have to explain through school. So, I suggested we use my surname as the surname and have his as a second middle name - basically on all important documentation so if he is taking her anywhere it’s easier/ won’t be called up on it. Whilst he said the second middle name was a good idea, he was angry and upset that I want to use my surname, when passing the name down is something fathers do.

Thing is, in my opinion, surnames are very linked to families and his family have made it clear that I am not welcome. His parents, despite both being born in the UK, disagree with our relationship and want him to marry another person from his culture. I have only met them about five times, due to how deeply unpleasant they are to me and he has a distant relationship to them too. My parents and brother (24m) have been the ones to take us under their wings, be there for him and even offer up our home for a bit when he moved to our city. He is super close to them, and my brother is one of his groomsmen in our wedding next year and I want to honour them by giving our surname to our child. I want our daughter’s surname to represent a place where she, and both of her parents, are always welcome.

He says I have a brother, who can carry on the family name whilst he has a sister who has already had kids, and I retorted saying I don’t see why that duty should only be for men? I said it’s not the middle ages anymore, and I am contributing as much money and time into our daughter, am growing and birthing her, and have a family who have supported our relationship and her unconditionally. It became a fight so I went to my parents’ (the next town over) where I am typing this now so we could have a breather. They don’t know the situation. I get that men have come to expect to have the surname, so I feel really guilty, but I want to carry mine on too. 

Any advice is super appreciated, as I really don’t know what to do.

  
EDIT: Thank you so much for your replies, I got a message saying I should clarify the following. The first name is Western. He's had the girl name picked since he was a teenager, and all of his boy names we discussed pre-finding out were Western - albeit pretty international names. The first name was 100% his choice, and I fell in love with it too as I realised it was a variation of my nan's name. Say my nan was called Carol, the name is Caroline.

1jpa51m,AITA for forbidding my girlfriend from doing household chores?,"A few years ago while putting together furniture, my (26m) girlfriend (27f) injured her wrists from using the screwdriver. We ended up getting her some wrist braces until the pain went away. We eventually checked with a doctor who said it was no big deal.

Since then, I've slowly forbidden her from doing chores around the house. I noticed that doing these chores (sweeping, scrubbing, cleaning dishes, etc.) would consistently agitated her wrists and she wouldn't be able to work on her actual job (small handmade crafts that require a lot of wrist usage.) I kept seeing the pattern of her straining her wrist on chores > bail out on her job after an hour or two and have to wear her wrist brace until the next day. She does love her job and when things go well can happily work up to 6 hours a day on her crafts, so since I can't do her job for her I want her to be able to focus on it.

I have no problem doing these chores, but today I caught her scrubbing a pan when I'd just reminded her yesterday to leave them alone and told her to call me if I'd missed one (and I would have hustled over to do it.)

She told me I'm being overbearing and that she's fine to scrub a pan, but I don't want her getting injured or develop worse long term damage.

AITA for insisting on doing the household chores?

Edit: Some clarifications.

- I should have put ""forbidding"" in quotes. I can't really stop her from doing anything besides maybe chiding her afterwards. I'm not her dad lol.

- I have shown her this thread and she agrees my version of events is more or less accurate but she still feels she's right.

Edit 2: Hello everyone. I stopped responding yesterday because I basically had the answer I needed 10 comments in (I was being the asshole lol) and then this post ended up getting almost 300. I actually got chided myself for spending so much time responding to messages that I ended up slacking on my work.

- I've gotten her a little jig to open soda cans with. I didn't know these things existed until yesterday.

- A lot of people are trying to diagnose her in the comments. We'll keep your ideas in mind the next time we go to the doctor/specialist (and I'll accompany her (if she wants) since people have let me know doctors don't always take women seriously.)

- I appreciate the level headed comments that aimed to help me understand her perspective more (which is why I posted.) To the people voting ESH she says: ""Why am I catching strays here? I just want to do the dishes!""

1jq2nid,"AITA for insisting that my sole provider payment of a $350,000 mortgage counts as a business expense for my wife’s home business?","AITA for stating that paying the mortgage counts as my contribution to organization of my wife’s business?

Hello all. I’m married to a wife I love dearly, but wow we don’t get along on most things. One of them is the situation with our basement.

I’m the sole provider—or at least the primary provider. (I provide at least 90% of our money.) She is a very good stay at home mother. She is also an aspiring business owner, and is finally starting to get it off the ground. She resells little trinkets and assorted goodies on Poshmark.

The issue is that the inventory takes up a LOT of space. It takes up so much space, that when we were in our starter home, it was a constant fight over her buying more inventory but not having anywhere to go with it.

I recently got a massive promotion, and a huge upgraded house. It has over 2,000 square feet, BEFORE counting the expansive open basement. It’s $350,000, and the monthly payment is $2,500. One reason we got it was so she could essentially have a warehouse where she lives. As the primary breadwinner, I pay for this entirely alone. We’re both on the property deed, but only I’m on the mortgage. I also pay for all other life necessities, to include the insurance, gas, and maintenance for three cars, and private tuition for our kids. Due to our quality of life, despite me pulling over $130,000 annual, we are still living paycheck to paycheck. I insist that a house this large is a large luxury—I grew up happy in a much smaller house, though she grew up in a house about this size.

Her business is starting to take off, and she finally has the money to pay one employee regularly. She’s paying this employee-friend to regularly help her organize the massive quantities of inventory that have been unorganized. She takes up over half the basement for her inventory alone, and another quarter for hundreds of gallons of stuff that none of us ever use but she refuses to get rid of. All of my things fit into one quarter of the basement, which I have immaculately organized, mostly because I just don’t have much.

Point is, basement needs organization, and not my one quarter—it’s her three quarters. Full of her stuff. I think I pay enough by paying the mortgage, and that she should have to pay for help if she needs help with those mountains of business inventory and just “things” she refuses to either use or dispose of. She says I’m unfair, and contributing nothing since I pay nothing to the helper.

She believes I’m not contributing to the organization because I have yet to pay a dollar to her employee-friend. She also insists that me paying the mortgage alone doesn’t count as helping with the business, because she refuses to see a house this large as a luxury and instead thinks I’m holding the necessity of family housing over her head. Am I the asshole for insisting that paying this mortgage is a luxury I provide her for her business?",Immediate-Regret-936,764,619,0.8199999928474426,0.1232115892064577,1743635065,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jq2nid/aita_for_insisting_that_my_sole_provider_payment/,2025,4,AmItheAsshole,2025-04-02 23:04:25

Lady i was sitting next to gave me an ugly look and told me i shouldn’t be reading “that stuff” in public. I asked her what she meant and she clarified that she meant “sexual material”. I told her it was a psychology book, not erotica and that even if it was she should mind her business. The cover is mostly black, but there’s a man in a suit and a lady’s leg with a high heel on the cover, however the cover overall is designed to be so dark that i have a hard time even seeing those images on the cover when i’m holding it up in front of my face. it’s very subtle. the cover has the subtitle “understanding bdsm sexuality and communities”. I feel as though i’m allowed to read whatever material I want on a plane, especially so because the intention of this book isn’t to turn anyone on. Like i said, it’s a psychological study.

1jvfln7,AITA for getting frustrated that my girlfriend always falls asleep on the couch?,"We’ve been dating for over 2.5 years. She always falls asleep when we watch TV or relax on the couch. Initially, this was adorable as someone was willing to trust me enough to consistently fall asleep on me. I was patient and gently woke her up and put her to bed. After a year, I became impatient because I knew her well enough to be able to tell she was getting comfortable and about to sleep. So, I pause what we’re watching and ask if she wants to go to bed. She always says she wants to stay on my lap. At first, I found this heartwarming and finished the remaining chores in the house, even though I didn’t appreciate she didn’t want to do it before falling asleep. And when i woke her back up to move to the bedroom she always wakes up confused and agitated. This makes me uncomfortable, and I’ve never liked waking anyone up. I also started feeling a bit parental which is not the kind of relationship i want to have. 

Last night she was falling asleep on the couch again and i needed to go shower. I asked her if she wants to stay up or go to bed because I am going to shower. She said she will stay up until i am back. When i returned from the shower i found her sleeping and all of her homework left out on the table (she needs to pack up so she can leave to work tomorrow). We had a major fight because i woke her up but in an openly annoyed and agitated way and told her to start “acting like an adult and sleep on the bed”. We havent spoken since and she is very mad at me. I am not sure how to handle this situation and wondering if i have to comfort her to bed for the rest of my life.

1jyk274,AITA for not caring if my sister visits and not wanting to change my plans?,"I, 24f have two siblings. Aaron, 26m, and Dorothy, 28f. Aaron is my best friend. We have an apartment together in a city a little drive from our parents. 
Dorothy is mentally disabled, she's like a 6 year old in a woman's body. Our parents are going to visit us in the city later this month, and Aaron and I want to take them to our favorite restaurant in our city. It's a delicious Mexican place, I can't even name a favorite dish because everything is so good. My mom asked us to change the restaurant because Dorothy won't eat Mexican food. I declined.
My mom came over with Dorothy the next day because apparently that really upset her. I don't feel like we should have to change our plans and eat at McDonald's. My mom said it's a bigger problem that we've never really tried to include Dorothy. I'll be honest, I don't like Dorothy. It's nothing personal and our parents actually did keep things pretty equal growing up, I'm just 24 and not super interested in censoring my speech and talking about Disney princesses. I don't like real kids either for the same reason. I told my mom maybe just her and Dad can come, so everyone can eat. I'd honestly prefer it that way just for once. My mom said “I think we're done here” and she walked out.

My dad called and he says I need to apologize to both my mom and to Dorothy, he said mom said Dorothy cried the whole way home because i said i don't like her. That's not what I said and I don't even know if that's true because my mom exaggerates. I've never said that to her face. Aaron says he agrees with me about the restaurant but I shouldn't have said that. I'm posting here because I really want to hear from someone impartial.

1k74si0,AITA to my gf for liking a classmate and friend’s Instagram post of her pole dancing?,"A friend of mine from grad school is a pole dancer by sport; she takes it seriously and has won pole dancing competitions. She’s not a stripper and by no means posts anything that can be construed as a thirst trap. Her Instagram is mostly her pole dancing because she’s an instructor and teaches. Her outfits consist mainly of athletic wear; think about gym/running shorts and tops you’d see girls in at the gym. 

Every year, the school has a talent show which I attended, and I didn’t even attend to see her nor did I know she’d be performing. I follow this friend on Instagram and she posted her performance. I liked it to show my support as a friend and classmate. This is the only post of hers I liked. 

My gf says she found this girl’s profile through the “Suggested” list on IG and saw that I liked the post, which made her blow up on me. Gf called me a “creep for liking a thirst trap,” that it’s disrespectful to my her as my gf for liking it, and that if her friends saw then it would be embarrassing for her. She also said this when she blew up on me:

It kinda disgusts me you're looking at any other woman, I don't do that. I would never disrespect you like that. I would also not seek out attention like that from anyone- or give it. I deserve the same. especially some lame ass pole dancer. That's just disrespectful.

AITAH? I genuinely just wanted to like the post as a way of supporting a friend and classmate. I’m not attracted to her at all nor do I see her in that way.

1k3yc8d,AITA for not cleaning before guests came over because I was tired?,"I usually do a majority of chores in the house. My husband helps with laundry and sometimes vacuums, but that’s pretty much it. I usually don’t mind because things get done at my pace, if something bothers him, he cleans it, and he is generally appreciative of what I do. And if I ask for help, he will help. 

Lately he has been having friends over after work. He works second shift, so I am asleep by the time this happens. In the past, if he mentioned having people over, I would clean. 
But a couple days ago he mentioned people would be coming over and it was a couple hours before I was going to sleep. 

The last few weeks have been very stressful for me and I haven’t been cleaning as much as I usually do. I just didn’t have it in me to clean much before they came over. I was tired. I just cleaned up the dishes from dinner and took out the trash but didn’t have energy to do more. Then I went to sleep. 

I woke up and he was not in bed. I had some text messages from him saying how it was embarrassing having people over the house because it wasn’t cleaned. He says it was disrespectful to him and his friends because I knew they were coming but didn’t fully clean up. 

I talked to him about it later that day and he said the same points again. He said I had a couple hours before bed and I should’ve at least vacuumed, mopped, and picked things up. I told him I was too tired to do that and if he wants to have me do all the cleaning, then he needs to accept it will be done at my pace and depending on what time, energy, and motivation I have. I don’t mind doing it, but it’s on my schedule. That’s the price of the arrangement. 

He thinks I was being spiteful by not cleaning more and that I am being rude by my comment on our arrangement. But I just didn’t have the energy for more cleaning.

1k0uoqa,AITA for cancelling on my friend after she wouldn’t pay for our lunch?," I 16F and my friend 17F (let’s call her D) have been friends for about 3 years. We are very close and hang out outside of school very frequently. We agreed to meet each other for a couple hours to study for our ap test. For context: every month my parents give me 100-200 dollars on a credit card so I can budget out what i’m going to spend for the month and D has been asking me almost every. single. day if I can get her coffee before school as I go very frequently. I’m going to be honest it does bother me that she asks all the time considering she has a bigger amount of money than me and she could easily just go get one herself before school and she never offers to pay me back. So knowing this, I asked her if she could pay for the food at our hang out since I got her about 5 coffees this month without being payed back. She agreed at first and then said she couldn’t anymore because she needs to buy a different friend a birthday present. I told her that my monthly allowance had run out and that I couldn’t go anymore. She seemed annoyed but I didn’t want to ask if she was upset or bring up that I was upset. I feel like it’s very selfish that she asks me for coffee almost every day but then won’t pay for our most likely 20 dollar meal. She also asks other people for coffee when I say no and I feel really used just because I drive to school and she has a license and a car but her dad drives her. 


UPDATE: she reluctantly agreed to pay after I told her I couldn’t go if she wasn’t paying and to answer some questions: the coffees are about 7 dollars each and I do get myself one too when I get her one and to be clear she has had my back in the past and payed for  big expensive meals once or twice when I really had no money she hasn’t been asking for the coffees for very long only about a month or so .

1jyl1xn,AITA for siding with my dad in the divorce even though he cheated on my mom?,"
My dad(52m) and my mom(49f) separated nearly 8 months ago due to my dad having an affair. I(17f) understand that my dad is in the wrong and cheating is never ok but recently I’ve found myself resenting my mom due to her reaction to the divorce.

She has been putting voice recorders in all of our vehicles, including mine. There is no way to know where else these are hidden it makes me feel uncomfortable to talk out loud even in my own home. She also put cameras all around our house hoping to catch my dad since he is no longer allowed in our home. She even put one directly in front of my bedroom which has not been removed even though I told her it seemed weird to me especially since I’ve given her no reason not to trust me and didn’t see a purpose behind putting a camera there. 

My dad had to buy a new phone since she could still log into his Apple ID and would go through it as well as log into his facebook and other social medias. Her email was the recovery email for all his passwords seeing as my dad has never been good with technology. Even after buying a new phone she somehow still has access to his location, I’m not sure how but I wouldn’t be surprised to find out she had an AirTag or tracker of sorts somewhere. She checks his location religiously and will leave at all hours of the day to follow him if she thinks he is going to meet another woman.

The reason I’m asking if I’m the asshole is because me and my mom recently got into an argument. I’ve had a strained relationship with her since she found out I was gay about a year ago but we are civil and just don’t talk about it. This argument started because she was questioning me about my relationship with my girlfriend(18f) and trying to tell me that she wasn’t good for me. I was annoyed with her because I try not to talk about my girlfriend around her to avoid the conflict. When she brought it up I responded without thinking and said “I don’t think you should be giving out relationship advice.” She immediately started crying and saying it wasn’t her fault and I shouldn’t hold that over her. I left the room but later we were watching TV and she reignited the issue by venting to me about dad and kept mentioning how he would probably marry “some whore” and just fully shit talking my dad to me and saying how horrible he was to her. I know she’s upset but I wish she wouldn’t vent to me about this situation because I still love my dad and would rather not be involved. I tried to just switch the topic but she doubled down so I said “it doesn’t really matter who he marries.” This upset her and she accused me of not caring at all that they split and then told me I was just like him and didn’t have any emotions. At this point I was angry with her and I said I would rather be like my dad than her and I could understand why dad would want to be with someone else.

Now she is accusing me of siding with my dad and excusing his actions. ",Educational_Slice658,533,515,0.7699999809265137,0.0989229585273476,1744586900,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jyl1xn/aita_for_siding_with_my_dad_in_the_divorce_even/,2025,4,AmItheAsshole,2025-04-13 23:28:20

1jzavfx,AITA for changing reservations over something my sister said?,"Throwaway. I (20F) turned 20 last week. I made reservations at a restaurant for the evening of my birthday and planned for me, my mum, my stepdad, my best friend and my younger sister (18) to go. Two days before my birthday, me and my sister had an argument because I wasn't able to pick her up because my friend had a medical emergency and I was the only one with him at the time so stayed with him. I was able to leave when the ambulance arrived due to his sister getting there. I was panicking at the time and forgot to text her that I wasn't able to pick her up. I completely forgot I was supposed to pick her up and then went home. I apologised profusely and she was still furious. We were both shouting because the argument got heated. She then said ""You're acting just like our dad"". Our dad was neglectful and emotionally abusive to us growing up, we often argued with him and he frequently forgot to pick us up from school.

1k7yr8k,AITA for holding SO responsible for kid eating food meant to be shared,"SO has 2 teen boys. They're going through puberty and rapidly growing, I get it. My problem is one of them consistently - about once a week - eats ALL of something that was bought for everyone to share. Sometimes it's all in one sitting, sometimes he takes it to his room and munches over 1-2 days until it's gone before anyone notices. In the past I've never complained because he's a teen (try to be understanding) and not my kid....

But a few days ago I get groceries including Costco size bags of tortilla chips and chocolate chips. Next day I'm looking to eat some chips and salsa, chips gone. I know what happened. Annoyed but don't. A few hours later I go down to bake with the chocolate chips and they're gone too, an entire 48 oz bag disappeared, emptied.

SO is out to dinner so I wait until it's supposed to be over then text him simply saying all the chips and chocolate chips I bought yesterday got eaten, buy more on the way home. Which he does. But then gets home fuming for making him do it. I tell him I think his anger is misplaced because I shouldn't have even had to ask, that stuff shouldn't be gone already. He's like what do you expect me to do about it? I tell him I just expect him to be responsible for his kid's actions. Then he said he will tell the teens not to touch anything I buy ever again. I replied you know that's not what I'm saying, you can allow whatever behavior you want but if it's inconsiderateness you should be still responsible for making right when it affects other people. He still thinks I'm being ridiculous, that it's no big deal.

They were already older when we got married, their mom is actively involved, and SO and I agreed that I should stay out of parenting and punishment.

I'll also add that if I see this kind of stuff happening I do say something politely just being the adult, like hey how about take a bowl of chips to your room instead of the whole bag, you can always get more but somebody else might want some... or like hey before you eat that last slice of pizza maybe you should see if your brother wants it since we got it for yall to share. I just don't lecture or reprimand after the fact, because it seems to cross into more punishment territory... besides that, SO allows it and it seems to mostly just happen behind my back at this point.

Also I could not go to the store myself because we have a baby who was already asleep for the night.

Due to the move, my job shifted to hybrid, and I needed a work-from-home setup. My bedroom is too small, and the only options were the lounge or one of the kids’ rooms during school hours. I proposed this to them - my son flat-out refused (“no way in hell”), but my daughter offered her room and half-joked about charging me rent for the space.

I thought it was fair, as I get a $20/day work-from-home allowance. I agreed to give it to her if she was okay with me setting up a small office in her room. I work from 8:30 to 5:00, and she usually starts homework right after I finish, so it’s worked out well.

Now the issue: my son is pissed that his sister is getting $60. I don’t do regular allowances, just canteen money (about $10/week) and other needs as they come up. I told him he had the same opportunity and was now shit out of luck. He got angry and brought up the move, saying he never gets to see his friends. (For the record, I drive them back to visit every two weeks for visits) I told him I understood his feelings but said I wouldn’t tolerate being spoken to like shit. He then started an argument with his sister too - going in on her for being an opportunistic bitch and she called him a whiny little asshole.

To cool off, I offered one of them the option to stay at their grandparents for the night - not as a punishment but to break the tension. My son opted to go & while dropping him off, my mom told me I was favoring my daughter and should be paying them equally. My dad disagreed, saying my son had the chance and was shit out of luck.

AITA?

Mom told me to put certain books away since they are inappropriate so I put them in a small locked drawer. I didn’t put The Handmaid’s Tale and some of my other dystopian novels there, though. Barely any space left so I had to pick which ones to lock up. The way I figured it, she probably wouldn’t be interested in them and the book in question full of my distracting, barely legible to anyone else annotations(I studied it for A Level English Literature when I was 16-17 and my handwriting was atrocious back then).

But she did end up getting interested in it. I came home one day to find out that she had been reading it and my uncle had found out and was telling her she is too young.

1klzbca,AITA for grounding my stepdaughter for selling my formal dress?,"I 37F have a stepdaughter, Amy, 16F. Amy was looking for formal dresses, and I mentioned that I have my old formal dresses. She picked my old prom dress to wear, and she has kept it in her wardrobe since wearing it at prom. I don't fit in my old dresses anymore, and I kept them and some other clothes to hand down to my kids, however, I have two sons who aren't interested. Since my nieces, 15F and 13F are interested in my clothes, I planned to give them the rest once they were old enough to fit them.

  
Amy left her earbuds in her sweatpants pocket and turned on the washing machine. When she asked for new ones, me and her dad told her to save up to buy new ones (she works part time) as she wanted an expensive brand new pair and not the wired earphones I had offered. 

  
Amy went to stay with her mom, and when she got back, she had the new earbuds she wanted, so I asked if her mom had bought them for her, and she said she had resold my dress on a second-hand site and bought herself the earphones. The dress is 100% silk, one of a kind, and the brand doesn't exist anymore. I was really upset to hear she had sold my dress, without even asking.

  
I confiscated her earbuds and told her I would give them back when she repaid me the cost of what she sold the dress for.

1kvd1su,"AITA for posting screenshots of my SIL's texts online and ""making her look bad""?","I (29F) and my wife (28F) had our sons six days ago, the pregnancy was complicated and they had TTTS (Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome) which resulted in them coming early. They are currently in the Neonatal Unit and my wife and I practically live there so we can spend time with our boys. 

My brother and his wife got married two days ago, I didn't want to leave my sons or my wife so I missed the wedding though I sent them their gift from us and a text wishing them a fantastic day and I thought nothing more of it. Yesterday I got a text from my new sister in law explaining that because my wife and I missed the wedding she'd need us to send her £140 for our plates of food. I asked her if she was joking and she told me that she got my wife couldn't go as she had to stay in the hospital but that I wasn't the one who gave birth so I could have went and saved two plates of food from going to waste.

I told her she was being ridiculous and asked if my brother was aware she was asking his sister for money for food, she brushed that off and said weddings were expensive and she had to try and recoup her losses and this should be between us ""woman to woman"". Between this and her thinking I should have gone anyway I admit I lost my temper. I ended up taking screenshots of the conversation and posting it to facebook.

This shocked several people in the family and she must have gotten bombarded with messages as she told me to take it down, as I was making her look bad and people were taking it out of context and thinking she was some kind of villain. My brother called me and told me not to worry about the money that it was stupid to expect us to pay for the plates though asked me to take the post down and he'd handle it. He seemed kind of shocked by her even asking this.

Did I go too far? My wife is mostly upset by our sil's comment about how I wasn't the one to give birth, as if it makes me less of their mother. Maybe I should have handled it better but I admit at the time I wasn't thinking very clearly.

1km0znf,AITA for refusing to give up my life insurance payout and asking my ex’s family to refinance the car he left me?,"So my ex passed away recently in a work-related accident. It’s sad, of course. I have a lot of mixed emotions about it. But the truth is, we hadn’t been together in over a year when it happened. We were together for five years, and we broke up because he cheated on me and got someone else pregnant. That breakup wrecked me. It took me a long time to recover. I haven’t seen him since.

After the breakup, I went no contact. I’ve spent the past year healing, learning to be happy again, and moving on. I didn’t go to the funeral. I didn’t want to see the baby mama or his family. And while I’m not happy he’s gone, I can’t say I’m devastated anymore either. I grieved this person when I left the relationship.

Now here’s where things get complicated.

Six months after our breakup, and **after**   the baby was born, he took out a life insurance policy. In it, he named me as the 50% beneficiary. His mom and the baby mama each got 25%. I didn’t know this until the insurance company called me. I assumed it was some paperwork leftover from when we were together. But nope this was a new policy, dated well *after* the breakup. That means this was his decision.

At the same time, there’s a car. He financed it while we were still together, but it’s under *my name and credit.* I begged him for **over a year** to refinance it, to the point the only reason I ever contacted him was for the refinancing of that car. He never refinanced that car, I doubt he was ever going to. Now that he’s gone, it’s still tied to me. The car is sitting in my garage, and his family has reached out saying the baby mama needs it for work. I told them, fine. You can have it as soon as it’s refinanced and no longer on *my credit.* I will **GLADLY** sign whatever paper they need. But I am not going to risk my credit on people I don’t trust to make payments.

And now they’re demanding that I give up the life insurance payout too. That I should “do the right thing” and give it to his mom or the baby mama. But here’s the thing, *I didn’t ask for any of this.* I didn’t ask to be put on that policy. He made that choice, after everything that happened between us.

Honestly?

I feel like I *earned* that money. I spent five years with that man. Five years dealing with the stress, the gaslighting, the emotional pain, the betrayal. I loved him deeply and I lost so much trying to make that relationship work. I stayed with him until *I found out* his baby mama was pregnant, because he was *actively hiding it from me* at that time. I was with him through the worst parts of his life. If anything, this money feels like the only thing I ever got back from all the bullshit. He chose to leave it to me. Probably because deep down, he knew how badly he treated me.

1ktu6ss,AITA for walking out of my parents' anniversary party when my brother announced his engagement to my ex?,"I just discovered my brother (29M) has secretly been seeing my college ex-girlfriend (32M) over the past year. We broke up 8 years ago and we'd been going out 4 years prior to the split but we actually knew each other very seriously when we'd been together. I challenged him when I discovered this and he said he didn't say anything to me b/c he didn't want me to get angry with him.

Last weekend we celebrated my parents' 40th anniversary celebration. My brother brought her to the party as his guest without letting me know beforehand. Her arrival with my brother left me shocked since we broke up and I hadn't laid eyes on her since then. During the meal, they declared their engagement and my mom began crying tears of joy.

I couldn't take it and left. My brother trailed behind me and we got in a big fight. I told him he should have warned me at the very least. He said I was being self-centered and spoiling our parents' party.

That evening my dad phoned me telling me I humiliated the family by leaving.

1kunvna,AITA for refusing to give a reward after two kids returned my opened mail with money inside?,"I'm 27F but I am pretty petite and could easily pass for like a high schooler. So I am home alone at my parent's place dog sitting and I get back from walking the dog and as soon as I close the door and lock it, I hear the ring cam doorbell go off and knocking and I can see through their Alexa that it's two kids. Probably middle school aged. They have a bike and scooter. I did not see them when I came back from the walk, so I don't know where they were waiting or where they even came from.  

They are just standing there and so I'm thinking that they are trying to sell something or another so I plan to just ignore them and focus on getting the dog resettled. Except now the dog is barking like crazy because she senses someone by the door and I can hear the kids say ""I just saw her go inside"". They then say ""we found something of yours and it has money inside"".

So they are knocking like crazy and even start kicking the door. I figure that I'll just speak to them through the ring bell so I say (without opening the door) ""Hi. Just leave it in the mailbox. I cannot open the door right now because my dog is not friendly"". Which is, true, but also like, I have no idea if this is a scheme or if there's an adult in a car waiting for them, etc. My mind is going into all sorts of scenarios that could end horribly for me. 

After them standing there for like five minutes, I can see through the cam that they put it in the mailbox and walk slowly away on their bike/scooter. About two minutes later, one of the kids comes back and puts his hood on. Rings the doorbell and I can see him put his hood on and I say ""what's up?"" through the ring cam. And he says ""My friend wants a reward"". And I say ""thank you for bringing back the mail but there is no reward, please leave"". And the kid just stands there demanding a reward. So I say ""I have your faces, if you try to threaten me, I will call the cops"". The kid then says ""call the cops I don't care! I returned your *money*. If I ever find something for your house again, I'm not returning it"". He then walks away before giving me the finger. 

I'm not looking to get these kids into any sort of trouble or anything because I think they were just being dumb fucks and they couldn't have been older than like 14/15 but AITA for not giving a reward? What they returned ended up being an opened envelope (don't know how they got it, if it was already ripped, or if they opened it) from my aunt that had a $20 bill in it (my aunt is old school like that). 

I've had my fair share of finding misplaced items/wallets and I've never once demanded or even expected a reward. My friend wanted me to post their faces on the NextDoor app and blast them but I don't know. So, AITA?

1kw7k5z,AITAH for putting up a security cam that caught my neighbor's kid wrecking my yard?,"For the past month, weird stuff kept happening around my house (I’m F, 42). Gnomes knocked over, mailbox dented, flowers pulled out… just random annoying vandalism. I figured it was some local kids, but had no proof. After the 3rd time my flowers got destroyed, I’d had enough.

I set up a small cam facing my front yard. It’s on my property, not hidden or anything, just not super obvious. A couple days later, boom — caught my neighbor’s 10 y/o son yanking out my flowers and tossing them in the street. Clear as day.

I went over to their house, calm, showed the vid on my phone. I thought they’d apologize or offer to replace the plants. Nope. They lost it. Accused me of “spying” on their kid, said I was “overreacting” to a “harmless prank,” and even threatened legal action for “filming their child.”

I explained the camera’s legal, on my property, and only points at my yard. They wouldn’t hear it. It turned into a full-blown yelling match.

Now they’re telling everyone I’m some creepy neighbor who hates kids. The street’s basically split. Some are on my side, some are giving me dirty looks.

So yeah… AITAH for putting up a camera to protect my stuff?

1kjkog3,WIBTA for wearing deodorant even though someone may be allergic?,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons. 

So, at the beginning of the second semester, we got a new teacher. This teacher said she had scent sensitivity and couldn't be around any perfume or fragrances. 


The people in my family have scent sensitives, so all my deodorant, soaps are unscented. 

I have continued wearing this deodorant for months, and I sit in the front of the class. This teacher has never seemed to react. 

Also, some of my friends put on scent products in the morning, and she never react, even though you can clearly smell it. 

Yesterday, I had Gym class and it ran over. I had to change into my school uniform and had no time to apply the deodorant. The bell rang and I was late for class. 

I reapplied the deodorant in the bathroom and went to class. However, I forgot to zip up my backpack. When I was in class, the deodorant fell out, and the teacher saw the deodorant. She asked if it was sent, and I said no. She then yelled at me, saying she was having an allergic reaction. 

But here's the thing. She didn't look like it. Her breathing didn't change, no watery eyes, stuffy nose, anything. And she just taught the class like normal.  

I felt bad and emailed her about what deodorant she didn't react so I could buy it, but got a response saying that was inappropriate. 

Part of me thinks she is faking. So, would I be the asshole if I just countinued wearing it.

1kzjdfn,"AITA for continuing ""adult"" activities in front of children because they crashed my party?","I own a lakefront property and usually enjoy hosting friends and family. For example, every 4th of July I throw a big BBQ, cover all the food and drinks, and don’t mind if people bring extra guests as long as it’s respectful. My family gets it and never takes advantage. If someone brings more than one person, they’ll usually contribute something like drinks or sides.

This past Memorial Day Weekend, I planned a reunion for a close college friend visiting from abroad. It was meant to be a kid-free, adults-only weekend. Lots of drinking, with friends staying over afterwards. 

My cousin happened to ask if she could use my house and lake that weekend, and I kindly said no and suggested nearby resorts. She got annoyed, saying she’d already told her kids they were coming since I usually never say no. I explained about my party, and she didn’t reply, so I thought it ended there.

Then Saturday afternoon, she showed up with her kids anyway. I told her they couldn’t come inside, but they could hang out at the community lakefront nearby. The issue was that the kids kept trying to come in to use the bathroom, grab water, etc. My friends weren’t doing anything illegal, just drinking and having fun like adults do, but my cousin asked me to get them to tone it down because of her kids. I told her no. She wasn’t invited, and I wasn’t changing my party for uninvited guests. Plus, they were already well into drinking for the day so it’s not like I could instantly sober up 20+ adults.

Now she’s telling our family I let my friends act “inappropriately” in front of her kids. Some relatives think I should’ve paused the drinking, but others agree she was out of line for showing up uninvited. 

For what it’s worth, the kids didn’t interact with my friends and were only inside briefly (I made sure to keep an eye on them when they came in), but they could see the alcohol.

1kmru7h,AITA for not letting my husband with $13k debt have access to my credit card,"Okay so my husband (36M) and me (33M) keep getting into arguments over money, especially getting him onto my credit card as an authorised user.

I’ve got 0 credit score because I immigrated here to the U.S. and only just managed to open a line of credit. I wasn’t even able to finance a car without huge interest on it (only one bank accepted me) so I’m still without a car.

He has not been good with his credit history, racking up $13k of debt with Amex before we had met which he has yet to pay off. 

I suggested to him he should see if he can improve it with a credit builder loan but I am not comfortable with him being on my credit card or having my CC details in his phone. He responds with saying married couples should be sharing assets and building credit together? 

Is it a given that spouses should have shared credit? Because I’m trying to establish my own credit history I cannot risk a bad credit score if he racks up debt without the means of paying it off. At the same time I feel guilty because he did support me when I wasn’t able to work before I got employment authorisation. 

Am I the asshole here for protecting my own interests? 

UPDATE: Thanks everyone! I really needed this vote of confidence and encouragement to stand my ground on this. I feel less guilty for putting my foot down with him. Going to see if I can put a freeze on my credit report this week and see if we can get him onto a personal finance course.

1kx2807,AITA for asking my husband to mow the lawn before work?,"It’s spring where I live and our grass has started growing again. My husband is usually the one who mows the lawn. On his days off, he usually says “wow I need to mow the lawn” and never ends up mowing it. Eventually he says he can’t do it anymore because it’s too late in the day and might disturb the neighbors. He also says it’s because sticks need to be picked up first and the leaves from the fall need to be removed. To help with that, I’ve actually went out, picked up all the sticks, bagged up the dead leaves. He still hasn’t mowed it. 

The grass is getting very tall. I’m worried about snakes and ticks in the yard. It’s also getting to the point where our lawn mower is going to have a difficult time handling it, especially in the front yard where the lawn is more lush. I had a neighbor complain to me when I was outside one day. 
 
After 2 more days off of not mowing it after he said he would, I asked him to please mow it before he goes into work. He works evenings and was scheduled to go in at 5:30pm. It’s one of his late days. He has hours to do it between waking up and needing to get ready for work. It only takes 45 minutes. 

He says I’m nagging about it and he will do it when he has time. He doesn’t have time and doesn’t want to mow it before work because he will be tired at work. He says he will do it on his next day off. I told him he’s been saying that for weeks and it hasn’t been done and he just repeated that I need to stop nagging him.

1kevlmt,AITAH My partner pays rent in my property,"I (31F) own a property that me and partner (31M) and our baby daughter live in. 
We split all bills 50/50 even though he earns more, I also buy her clothes, pay her swimming lessons and all the bits I notice that she needs. 
He has lived here for 2.5 years and I have lived here 5 years. I moved out of my parents when I was 17 and I worked my ass off to buy the place by myself 5 years ago. I was paying rent and saving for a mortgage at the same time, it was hard work and took dedication as I did not get any financial help.
He has asked to be added to the mortgage as he has been contributing here (monthly payments only), he says he is entitled to a share and his family have been doing research on that.
I feel hurt that they would do that, it feels like I’m not sure if I can trust him or them now. I haven’t had an easy journey to get to the security that I built for myself and I can be a bit over protective about that, especially now I have a child and inevitably I want to build her future too. 
I’m very careful not to put myself in vulnerable positions but now I feel I’m vulnerable. We have really disagreed on this, and he has moved out.
Morally I find it wrong that the father of my child, and his family would support him taking from me and his daughter. He said that would never happen, but why would they research it? And also, I’m not putting someone on the mortgage who does not have any actual investment to put down, it feels like he wants an easy ride to the property ladder.
Am I wrong to be upset? Am I the AH?

1kzg04r,AITA for refusing to accept the wrong drink at a restaurant nm,"Recently, my husband and I went to a restaurant with his family. My husband and I ordered their ""handmade"" margaritas. These were listed with your choice of anejo tequila with fresh sqeezed lime juice and simple syrup. However, when the margaritas arrived, they were in giant fishbowl margarita glasses (1 shot of tequila, plus lime and simple syrup cannot fill a 20 oz glass) and they were ORANGE. I immediately knew we were brought the house margaritas with the mixed sweet and sour, but I tried it anyway. It was awful. My husband shrugged and said he'd drink his, but at $20 each, I wasn't going to accept a cheap tequila with a mix. 

I called the waitress over and explained that we were given the wrong margaritas, but she insisted they were ""Handmade"". So I said, ""Ok. Well, it's not good. So you can just take it, I can't drink it. I don't want anything else, please just take it off the bill."" 

Which should have ended it, except she came back with the bartender holding the drink. He asked what was wrong, I told him what I ordered, he insisted that's what it was. So I asked, ""Then why is it orange? If it's lime and tequila and simple syrup, why is it orange?"" He looked at me, then looked at the drink and said, ""You're right. It's not the right drink. I can make you the right one and I'll remake his."" 

I said no, I didn't want a drink anymore, I just wanted it corrected on the bill to reflect the $10 margarita my husband actually received. They left, and I thought it was settled until the MANAGER came over and insisted they remake the margaritas to make it right. At this point I was annoyed and regretting not letting them remake it just to be left alone, but I also no longer even WANTED it, so I said, ""How about I just get a mezcal, neat, instead?"" That seemed to make the manager happy. But after the manager left, my husband said, ""Why didn't you just let them bring you a replacement the first time? Or just drink it when she told you it was right? You've made everyone uncomfortable.""

1kp5ed0,AITA for accusing my wife of using weaponized incompetence to get out of doing things she'd rather I do for her.,"The wife has been going to see a life coach and she a few months ago came back with the term ""weaponized incompetence"" which basically means a husband is intentionally failing to do a task he doesn't want to do, so that the wife will just do it herself to get out of helping out. This is something she accused me of doing after she pushed some of her household duties onto me. I was simply just learning how to do things in the way she likes after not doing them since we moved in together.

Ex. I started doing dishes, I washed them, put them up and she didn't like the way they were arranged because I arranged them by what we used the most, whereas she did it by height. ""Weaponized Incompetence"".

So recently, after a package was stolen off our door step while I was out of town, I started reviewing our front of house cameras and I saw my wife removing the doors off her jeep while preparing to take our sons to the beach. This is strange because until that moment, I had thought she couldn't do it herself as it's too heavy and/or complicated for her to do it herself. So I always did it for her. Not really an issue, I don't mind doing it for her, and I had just assumed she figured it out by herself since I wasn't there.

This Friday we decided to go for a nature drive, and my wife said she'd get everything ready while I was at work so we could go the second I got home. I got home and the doors were still on. I ask her why she didn't take the doors off. She said ""You know that's too heavy for me to do myself, I was waiting on you"". I told her I saw the video of her doing it through the front cams.

She got flustered and I quickly realized she probably could do this the entire time but just pretended not to be able to. I called it what it is, weaponized incompetence. She got incredibly mad and accused me of not wanting to help her ever and said I had been saving this to ""deflect"" from my own shortcomings. We had a huge fight and the trip ended up getting postponed, which disappointed our sons.

I don't think I was wrong to say what I said but here we are. Am I the Asshole?",ShenBapiro34,2182,598,0.8999999761581421,0.1315967261276008,1747521881,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kp5ed0/aita_for_accusing_my_wife_of_using_weaponized/,2025,5,AmItheAsshole,2025-05-17 22:44:41
1kzignf,AITA for telling a clients boyfriend to leave?,"I’m a 27yo (F) and I work as a piercer in a parlour. Recently, this girl came into the shop with her boyfriend and told me that she wanted to get both of her nipples pierced. As I was helping her pick out the jewellery she wanted for her piercings, I noticed that the entire time her boyfriend was just sulking behind her. He kept asking her if she really had to get her nipples pierced and was overall just creating an extremely awkward vibe. 

When we went into the back so I could do the piercing, her boyfriend came along, which I don’t mind as many people bring someone along with them. As I was preparing everything, her boyfriend asked me If there was any way I could pierce her nipples without having to see her boobs. I told him that obviously she doesn’t have to just completely show me her boobs, but I still need to be able to see her nipples or how else would I be able to pierce her?  He then started speaking to her quietly but I could still hear what he was saying. He was saying that he wasn’t comfortable with someone who wasn’t him seeing her in that way. I didn’t understand why he was being so insecure as this is just my job? I don’t view what I’m doing as sexual, i’m just simply giving someone a piercing

And then he asked me in these exact words if i’m “into girls” and I tried to make a lighthearted joke by asking him why that mattered and he just responded by asking if i’m going to be “turned on” by seeing his girlfriends boobs. His girlfriend kept telling him to shut up and just let me do the piercings so they can get it over with. I am straight and I’m engaged to a man but why does that even matter?? Even if I was into girls that doesn’t mean i’m going to just get turned on by piercing your girlfriends nipples?? 

I politely asked him if he would mind just standing outside while i done the piercings because I didn’t appreciate the questions he was asking me as they were extremely inappropriate. He then started accusing me of wanting to be alone with his girlfriend, he also spotted the engagement ring on my finger and said he felt sorry for whoever had to marry me knowing this is my job. I kept telling him to leave, he refused and started getting loud enough that he alerted several of my coworkers who all came in to see what was happening. 

My coworkers were eventually able to get him to leave and his girlfriend decided that she would leave with him. I told her that I still had no problem doing the piercings for her but she said that she didn’t want to make the situation any worse and she apologised for the trouble and left. Afterwards my manager told me that I should have just ignored what he was saying and just done the piercings. I just felt that him asking me If i was gonna be turned on by piercing his girlfriend was extremely gross and inappropriate?? Most of my coworkers agreed that I should have just ignored what he was saying and not have made a big deal out of it but i’m honestly just so conflicted. AITA?

1kyq026,AITA for watching a girl park because I was impressed and getting called a sexist creep for it?,"I (48M) was walking back to my car after grabbing lunch downtown when I saw a girl probably early 20s trying to parallel park an older SUV into an extremely tight spot. It was one of those gaps where even newer cars with parking sensors would struggle. I could tell right away her SUV was an older model, no cameras or sensors at least not from the factory, so I figured it’d take some real skill to get in cleanly.

I stopped on the sidewalk and watched. I wasn’t staring like a weirdo, just standing with my coffee, kind of interested. I actually thought she must be a really good driver to even try that spot with that car. I even told myself maybe I’d pick up a technique or two. Also, as she was parking, we made eye contact and I smiled, kind of like an encouraging “you got this” thing. I also figured if she ended up tapping the car in front or behind and drove off, I could leave a note or something. I wasn’t looking to get involved, but I’ve seen people drive off after a hit before.

She ended up pulling it off fast and clean, two moves, right in, no issue. As she got out, she looked right at me and said, “Are you serious?”

I said, “Sorry?”

She goes, “You’ve just been standing there watching me this whole time like I’m some kind of show. What, you think I can’t park because I’m a girl?”

I said, “No, not at all. It was just a tight spot and an older car, and you handled it really well. I was just—”

She cut me off. “Save it. You’re literally just standing around watching a young woman try to park like it’s entertainment. It’s creepy and pathetic. Don’t pretend it’s about the car.”

I said, “Look, it had nothing to do with you being a woman. I just figured you must’ve known what you were doing to even attempt that spot, and I was curious. That’s all.”

She scoffed and said, “Yeah, sure. You’re not the first guy to pull the ‘I was just being impressed’ line. It’s sexist and weird. Try minding your own business next time.”

She walked off before I could say anything else. I’ll admit I was kind of stunned. I didn’t say anything rude, I wasn’t leering or making comments, just quietly watching in public for maybe 30 seconds.

Later, I told my sister about it, and she didn’t even hesitate. She just said, “Yeah, that’s exactly the kind of thing that makes women feel uncomfortable. Don’t be surprised she called you out.”

I honestly don’t see how it was sexist. I didn’t assume she couldn’t park. If anything, I assumed she could, which is why I watched. It had nothing to do with gender. It was a tough park, an old SUV, and I was just observing. It’s a public sidewalk. I didn’t touch her car, didn’t speak to her, didn’t do anything but stand there.

1knjmh3,AITA for not inviting my brother’s fiancée to my wedding after she didn’t invite me to hers?,"So this has been bugging me for a while and now it's turning into family drama, so I need an outside perspective.

I’m (29F) getting married this fall. My brother (31M) is also recently engaged to his fiancée, let’s call her Lisa (28F). We’ve always been friendly, not super close or anything, but there was never any bad blood between us. At least, I didn’t think so.

Anyway, a few months back, they started sending out wedding invites. I didn’t get one. I waited a bit, thinking maybe it was a mistake or that mine was just late, but then I asked my brother about it — kind of awkwardly — and he straight-up told me Lisa didn’t want me there. When I asked why, he said she felt like I “draw too much attention” and she didn’t want “any distractions” on her big day.

That really hurt. I wasn’t planning to wear white or break into a choreographed dance or anything ridiculous. I just… show up, be supportive, enjoy the day. It felt like she saw me as some kind of threat, which honestly blindsided me.

Worse, my brother didn’t really stand up for me. He just said, “It’s her day, I want to support her,” and that was kind of that. I didn’t go. I tried to let it go even though it really stung.

Fast forward to now — my wedding is coming up and I decided not to invite Lisa. I invited my brother (just him), figuring I could at least try to maintain that relationship. But now he’s upset. He called and said I’m being petty and punishing him for something that wasn’t really his doing. I told him I just don’t feel comfortable having someone at my wedding who clearly didn’t want me at hers — it’s not about revenge, it’s about protecting my peace on my own day.

He said he won’t come without her and now our parents are getting involved. My mom thinks I did the right thing by setting a boundary, my dad says I should just invite her and not make it a bigger deal.

I honestly don’t know if I’m being reasonable or if I’m letting my feelings get the better of me.

It’s not a normal blender. It’s industrial strength. It's the kind of thing you’d use to puree cement.

She uses it *every single morning* at 6:00 a.m. to make a “power smoothie.” I have asked — politely, repeatedly — if she could maybe wait until like 8 a.m.? Or just make it the night before and keep it in the fridge?

She says (verbatim), “I have sensory needs and blending calms me.” She calls it her *emotional support blender*. She even named it. (**Gary.**) She says Gary helps her feel “in control of the chaos.”

I work night shifts and usually don’t get to bed until 3:00 a.m., so this means I'm getting jarred awake by a jet engine three hours into my sleep. Every. Day. Thanks Gary.

Last week, I lost it. I came out of my room, and said, “Tina, either Gary goes or I do.”

She cried. Legit tears. She said I was “ableist,” “cold,” and “don’t respect her coping mechanisms.” I feel bad now. Like, I *get* that people have mental health needs, but does it have to involve pulverizing frozen bananas at sunrise?

Things are good between us, but I’m naturally very introverted and need alone time to recharge — especially after a stressful semester at university.

My parents invited me to join a short family vacation (5 days at a lake house), and I was really looking forward to just relaxing, reading, and spending time with them. When I mentioned the trip to my boyfriend, he immediately assumed he was invited too and said something like, “Awesome, I could really use that break too.”

I awkwardly told him that it was meant to be a small family trip and that I wanted some solo downtime without needing to “host” or be social all the time. He seemed surprised but didn’t say much then.

Now, days later, he’s clearly distant. He hasn’t brought it up directly, but he’s been short with me and mentioned feeling “excluded.” A mutual friend told me he thinks it’s weird I wouldn’t want him there, and now I’m wondering if I was selfish.

I just wanted a quiet trip, not relationship drama.

i am very put off by this, because there isn't a lot of space already, and on top of that, i don't feel like he does enough around the house to have a say in the decor, especially something so drastic (ie. running a humidifier constantly which can create mold in enclosed spaces, blockading my favorite window in the house with his grow lights etc.) he doesn't pay rent, hardly does chores without an argument, never cleans up after himself or the messes he makes, and the only thing he pays for has been the electricity bill (twice now) and two months of internet. that is it.

Since she was about 11, she has wanted to pierce her ears like a few of her friends have. My mom got my ears pierced when I was a toddler, so I was all for it, but Leo said no, and she had to be a bit older. 

Over Christmas, Mila was at Leo's, where she got him to promise that if she still wanted to pierce her ears after her birthday, he would take her to get her ears pierced. When he dropped off Mila, she excitedly told me that her dad had finally agreed. I think Leo was banking on Mila forgetting he had agreed, because she asked him to book the appointment for next weekend after her birthday, but she also wanted a helix piercing, and he called me to say he wanted me to say no. 

I told her that it was not fair of him to throw me under the bus or to back out, as he had promised her she could, and that I had agreed years ago she could, and it was now his problem to talk to her about it.

1kw8lf9,AITA for asking a coworker not use the bathroom in my office?,"I work in a school (not as a teacher) where my designated workspace/office is a former teacher workroom. Having a traditional office wasn’t working because I was constantly having to find a larger space to do my job, so my admin moved me a few years ago. 

I love having the space, and it comes with the benefits of a printer and bathroom. I have never been a gatekeeper of the space and don’t mind when nearby staff members need to use it even though there’s another workroom a few doors down. 

I have one coworker who frequently (several times per week) uses the bathroom. Not to be crude, but the smell she leaves behind is toxic. I have put air fresheners in the bathroom and bought a bottle of poopouri, but it doesn’t help. I genuinely think she needs to see a doctor. 

We are both 12 month employees, so no summers off, and the heat has not helped with this issue. I pulled her aside last week and explained that I would appreciate if she found an alternative location to do her business. I’m fully aware that everybody poops, but that is my designated workspace, and I don’t want to have to smell it all day, especially when there are other bathrooms on campus that aren’t somebody’s office. 

She got upset and told some of our coworkers that I’m singling her out and not letting her use the bathroom. Some of them agree with me because they have smelled the aftermath, and some of them think I should have taken a different approach (asked for a different workspace/asked for more air fresheners, etc). So AITA for asking that she use a different restroom?",stribalibalib,2271,177,0.9700000286102296,0.0944245593636496,1748301624,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kw8lf9/aita_for_asking_a_coworker_not_use_the_bathroom/,2025,5,AmItheAsshole,2025-05-26 23:20:24
1ksa91j,AITA for telling my dad I don't want him to marry his girlfriend?,"Honestly this is embarrassing so I am using a throwaway.

My parents (both 46) got divorced 6 years ago. My mom remarried 3 years ago, and my dad has had a few girlfriends. His current girlfriend is the only one he has ever brought around. My mom has met her and likes her, and my sister idolizes her. She's nice and I don't dislike her. 

The actual problem: she's 27, exactly 10 years older than me. To me, it's so weird. I dont understand why my dad wants to date someone so much younger than him. When he asked my sister and I if we were okay with him asking her to marry him, my sister was excited. I wasn't. I told him i wasn't comfortable with the age gap and thought she was just a sugar baby. Dad explained she has her own career, but said okay. 

Since that conversation, my dad has been really sad, and the atmosphere in his house has changed. His girlfriend hasn't been by as frequently either. I feel kind of bad because I want my dad to be happy. Aita?

Edit: this blew up bigger than I expected it to and found it's way to my dad. Now he wants to have a talk this weekend.

1kul2is,AITA for bringing my neighbors packages inside my apartment because I was worried they’d get stolen?,"I (28F) live in a mid-rise apartment building in the city. We don’t have a front desk or package lockers—just a narrow hallway where all deliveries get dumped. If you’re not home within a few hours, good luck.

My across-the-hall neighbor, Marcus (30s? late 20s? I honestly don’t know), gets a lot of packages. Fancy ones too—clothing boxes with brand names, curated subscription kits, expensive-looking stuff. I'm not trying to spy or anything, but when you live in close quarters, you notice these things. I’d occasionally see boxes just sitting out overnight while he was clearly out of town, which made me anxious on his behalf.

About six weeks ago, I heard him swearing in the hall and went out to see what was wrong. He said one of his packages—some cologne he’d ordered—got stolen. He looked genuinely upset and mentioned it wasn’t the first time. I said something like, “Man, this building really needs lockers or something.” He nodded but didn’t push it.

So after that, I started bringing his deliveries inside my apartment whenever I noticed they’d been sitting for more than a few hours. Just to be safe. I stacked them in a corner near my front door and gave them back when I saw him. Usually, he just said thanks and took them. No big conversation.

Then last week, he knocked and asked me to stop.

He wasn’t rude about it, but he looked super uncomfortable. He said he appreciated the intention, but it made him uneasy to know his stuff was in someone else’s apartment. He added that it felt like I was “tracking his movements” since I always seemed to know when he wasn’t home.

I was kind of stunned. I explained that I was just trying to help—that I wasn’t snooping, I just saw stuff piling up. He said, “I get it, but... yeah, it crosses a line. Please don’t touch my packages anymore.”

I said okay, and he left. But now I feel weird. I genuinely thought I was doing a good deed. I wasn’t opening his stuff, just holding it for a few hours until he got back. It’s not like I was rifling through his mail.

But then it got more awkward. A few days ago I saw him through his peephole (yes, I was walking to my door, not lurking lol), and he literally waited until I went back inside before he came out to grab his box. Like he’s timing it now?

Then this morning, I overheard him talking to another neighbor while checking his mail. He said something like, “Yeah, some people think doing favors means ignoring boundaries.” I don’t know he meant me, but… it felt pointed.

Now I’m second-guessing everything. I told my sister and she said it was “weirdly possessive” and that I should’ve just left a note asking if he wanted help next time. But I never thought it would turn into this.

So... AITA for taking matters into my own hands when I thought I was doing something neighborly?

Would love honest thoughts because now I feel like I’m the hallway psycho.",dunkdeboffin1,1027,610,0.9100000262260436,0.0933176804341237,1748118629,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kul2is/aita_for_bringing_my_neighbors_packages_inside_my/,2025,5,AmItheAsshole,2025-05-24 20:30:29

1ktv9pb,AITA for not voting for my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend and I hosted a PowerPoint presentation night with all of our friends (total 10 people).
It was a big bash where everyone would do a PowerPoint presentation on a pre determined topic and then vote for the best PowerPoint. 1st place and 2nd place Winners would get a couple bouquets of flowers.

We were all having a great time and everyone presented and we cast our votes. Reading out loud the number of votes each person received. 
After winners were announced and flowers were given out, my boyfriend pulled me aside. He was incredibly upset that he hadn’t gotten any votes and that I had not voted for his presentation.

I told him I only got to cast two votes (1st and second place) I was just trying to vote for the ones I thought were the best and some of our friends put incredible amounts of effort into their presentations. Some friends dressed up, one friend wrote a song on guitar, another included a 3d animation they made in theirs. While I loved the presentation my boyfriend did, and the topic was really funny and he loved getting to share it with the group, other members of our group clearly put a lot more effort into theirs.
I told him it was a tough call but I didn’t want to be biased.

I could tell he was still a bit upset, even after the party was over. I apologized and told him I should have voted for him.

Am I the asshole for not voting for my boyfriend’s presentation?

1kggjrd,AITA For telling a woman that I'm not at fault because she can't control her dog?,"Hey y'all! So, this morning I (25f) took my 6 month old lab/malinois mix puppy to the local park for a walk/training session. The way the park is set up is that there is a children's play area and a walking track that starts at the mouth of the play area and loops around the perimeter of the rest of the park (not the play area). So, on my final lap another couple with a medium mix breed dog gets out of a car and starts walking the path in the opposite way as me (so that we would meet in the middle). Once I notice them getting closer, I stepped off the path and start making my way to the parking lot, cutting through the grass because while my puppy is generally good with passing another dog no problem, I like to minimize the possibility of issues especially with us leaving. I'm still walking in the same direction I was, just about 50ft away from the path more in line with the parking lot. As we come almost parallel with this couple, their dog hits the end of its leash almost yanking the lady off her feet growling and barking and trying to get closer to us. I keep going, ignoring them and calling my puppy into a close heel to keep him from engaging with the other dog. This woman then proceeds to yell at me telling me that I'm at fault for her dog reacting and that I shouldn't be at the park cause I'm never there when they are and I'm the one causing a scene. I turn to this woman and tell her ""Don't blame me because you didn't train your dog and can't control him"". I then promptly continued and got to my car, loaded up my dog, and left, the whole time this lady is cussing me out and her dog is going even crazier. I was venting to my mom, and while she was empathetic, she told me that it was rude of me to respond instead of just continuing to walk away.

1ksaj9r,AITA for refusing to babysit my sister’s “miracle baby” after she refused to help me when I had a miscarriage?,"A year ago, I had a miscarriage after trying for a baby with my husband for 3 years. It was devastating. My sister (32F), who never wanted kids, announced she was pregnant two months later — a “miracle baby” after a one-night stand.

I congratulated her, but emotionally, I was still raw. I asked her not to talk about baby stuff constantly around me while I healed. She said I was being selfish and needed to “get over it.”

Fast forward — she had the baby, and now she’s constantly asking me (29F) to babysit. I declined gently at first, but recently I said I don’t feel emotionally ready to watch her child — the one she had after dismissing my grief.

She blew up, called me heartless, and said I’m punishing an innocent baby. My mom says I need to “be the bigger person” and “stop living in the past.” But I think I’m allowed to have boundaries.

1kmu395,"AITA for telling my mom ""You lost two kids, do you want to lose another?"" when she treatened to kick me out?","Prefacing this with the fact that there is a lot of abuse and history I can't cram into a Reddit post.

My mom (50F) has always had problems with substance abuse, as well as untreated mental illness. After a few times of her getting drunk, one of which ended in a hospital visit, she vowed not to buy alcohol for herself. Her mental illness has led to the abuse, mostly mental, of me (20F) and my sister (17F).

The night of Mother's Day, my mom started drinking. She got inebriated. Every time she is drunk, it is a traumatic trigger for me. She lied to me and said she had two shots. Later she seemed more drunk, so I checked the trash and found ten shot bottles. I confronted her again and said that I wanted better for her and that she agreed to not have alcohol. She began to vent (she vents to me without my consent often) and scream to me about the loss of my siblings, which I did not know that was why she was drinking. This argument got heated, so I decided to go on a drive. Contacted my partner (19M) who offered to let me stay the night at his place. I accepted and went home to grab my things. My mother confronted me again. I said I was going to my partner’s house, and she threatened to kick me out of her home. She has done this on several occasions, then later told me that she ""never means it"" and says it ""only to instill the fear of god in me.""

When I came home, we had a discussion that I thought would fix things a little. I said it would be good for us to keep the alcohol out of the house and I could help find resources for therapy for her. She agreed to the alcohol, but declined therapy sternly. I also asked not to be threatened with homelessness which she did not seem receptive to.

Went to work the next day and came home. She begins an argument with me and states that ""if I wanted to not be homeless so bad, why doesn't she leave me the house and take my sister with her."" I asked if she would give me enough time to get a better job. She said ""I don't know."" I told her if she would leave me high and dry without that, which would be the same as being homeless, she would be throwing away the future she wanted for me (i would have to drop out of college to work) and i would go no-contact. She did not have remorse, and things got very heated until I said ""You lost two kids, do you want to lose another?"" in reference to going no-contact with her. I don't know if she interpreted it as that or taking my own life. She was, for lack of a better word, flabbergasted. I said ""I didn't want to pluck at your heartstrings but maybe that's what I need to get my point across."" She said ""that wasn't a pluck, that was a fatal blow.""

I have since apologized for what I said over text as I haven't been home as of the time of posting this.

I have a backup plan. I might be too jaded to tell if was I really disrespectful or rightfully standing up for my wellbeing.

1krg6rl,AITA for refusing to engage with my dead husband's secret mistress?,"My husband passed away suddenly and violently a year ago. While cleaning out his items I uncoverd several letters from a female detailing a 10 year affair - mailed to our home that he had apparently intercepted.  We had his creamation and private family ceremony, and then one year later to the day i get a text message out of nowhere from a female claiming to be his girlfriend.  She claimed she was the love of his life, and she told me that she knew I was keeping his creemains away from her and she wanted half of them.  Which was odd as I woked witht the funeral home and organized events to bury his cremains in a private family ceremony a month after his passing.

This woman also took it upon herself to contact my inlaws (his sister and brothers) and beg them to take them into their lives, send them photos of my husband and her together and said that I was a rotten human he promised her he would leave for many years but never did.  She also contacted our 18 year old daughter and posed as a friend of her fathers, got her to meet up for coffee and started asking all sorts of personal questions about me and my relationsip and the funeral.

During her message to me she called me many names, and was very immature.  I also need to note that this woman is 60 years old - a full 15 years older than myself, and claimed that my husband and her had big plans and that i was a rotten person and she would prove it and tell my inlaws.

Am I the a-hole for telling this woman not to interfere with my family and his family and to leave my daughter alone? I have blocked her, but I'm pretty shaken up.

She’s still mostly clear-headed but has some confusion—especially when it comes to money. My younger sister “Chloe” (45) has always had a history of asking for financial help. Over the past few years, I noticed Mom was constantly ""lending"" Chloe money for things like car repairs, rent, or medical bills. Chloe always promised to pay her back, but she never did.

Meanwhile, Chloe’s social media told a very different story. Fancy trips, new gadgets, designer stuff… all while Mom was suddenly being super frugal. She even stopped buying things she used to enjoy. It didn’t sit right with me.

Mom asked me to help her look at her bank statements because she was confused. With her permission, I started going through them and what I found made my stomach drop. Chloe had been taking large amounts of money for years—way more than what she claimed she needed. It wasn’t help anymore, it was financial abuse.

I confronted Chloe, showed her the evidence, and she flipped. Accused me of being jealous, trying to control Mom, etc. I gathered everything and showed our other siblings and Mom’s financial advisor. It was brutal, but the truth was undeniable.

Now Chloe’s been cut off, and most of the family has distanced themselves from her. She’s livid, saying I destroyed her life and tore the family apart. Mom’s heartbroken by the conflict, which absolutely kills me. Some relatives think I should’ve handled it quietly or just let it go for the sake of Mom’s peace.

1kun43r,AITA for not uprooting my life and moving to my parent’s city to take care of them?,"I (28M) am an only child. I currently live in Chicago with my wife (27F) and our newborn son born beginning of May. My parents live in Boise, where they eventually settled when I was in high school. They’re both in their late 50s early 60s now, don’t have extended family nearby, and have always expected that I’d eventually move back to be close to them.

For a long time, I was open to the idea. I didn’t promise, but I didn’t shut it down either. So I get why they held onto that hope. But over the past couple years, a lot changed. My wife and I built a life in here in Chicago, I started a screen printing side business and love that the arab community is strong here. My wife got a solid job, and I recently started new work remotely in tech. Basically we’re really starting to find a rhythm here it’s been amazing. 

Boise is much cheaper—yes. We’d probably save on a house and lower our expenses overall. But that would come at a huge emotional and logistical cost to my wife, who has her family, career, and support system here. She’d be isolated in Boise, and we’d both be giving up everything we’ve built including my side business—right when our newborn needs stability the most. Additionally the arab community in Chicago is so much stronger and more influential, and I’d love for my son to grow up around that. I had had a really tough time in Boise in not fitting in, and experiencing some racism - all and all not a great experience. 

They really wanted to bring up this conversation shortly after I had my son, I continuously tried to get them to talk to me in person or on a call about this but they just wanted to text. When I told them i’m not willing to move to Boise from Chicago they essentially had a massive crash out and disowned me as their son - deleting me off all their social media, leaving all our group chats, and saying I should change my last name. I offered multiple compromises: extended visits, frequent visits, even that my parents could move in with us for now (we have a space we could convert into a room for them), and we’d work toward buying a larger home with a separate suite for them within a few years. They refused. They said the only solution is me moving to them.

They said they feel abandoned, accused my wife of manipulating me, told me to stop messaging them, and said they’re cutting me off. My dad told me I should “consider my parents dead” and that he never wants to see me again. He said I lied to them by ever being open to moving. 

I’ve continually tried to stay respectful, even though they have been nasty, bad talking me, my wife, and my wife’s family. I’ve told them I love them and always will. I’ve kept the door open, but am I really the asshole for not wanting to uproot everything and move back to Boise?",Substantial-Day9612,865,363,0.949999988079071,0.0641967022889773,1748124353,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kun43r/aita_for_not_uprooting_my_life_and_moving_to_my/,2025,5,AmItheAsshole,2025-05-24 22:05:53
1kfpbnw,AITA for confronting a parent after the comment she made to me?,"I (24F) am a high school teacher in a pretty wealthy small town. As far as teacher salaries go we are generally paid very well, but I also happen to be an incredibly frugal person. I have some goals for the future that are very important to me, so at this point in my life. So, especially when it comes to recurring expenses, I will choose the cheapest option available almost always. I could afford to pay more, but at this point in my life that doesn’t make sense to me.

Today, parent saw me buying canned chicken, a bag of rice, and some tortillas from a dollar store.(I don’t think she would ever step foot in a dollar store, but the store is next to a pretty fancy gym.) She started making comments to me about how she knows that we’re paid well, so it’s “unprofessional” to “make myself look poor” by buying food at the dollar store. I tried to deflect with humor like I usually do just talking about how I’m a cheapskate. That didn’t seem to work. She kept asking me questions about what the kids would think (I don’t think they care), and if I really want to be viewed that way (I don’t really care). I did have a chance to walk away, but I didn’t take it. Instead, I told her it was none of her business, and that on my free time I live whatever life I want to, and she has no say over that. That escalated the situation immensely. She ended up talking about how her taxes pay my salary.  That’s what I probably messed up because I followed up with “well then you should be happy. I’m making those tax dollars stretch.”

I had to have a conversation with my boss today because she sent him an email. He didn’t say I was wrong, he understood where I was coming from completely, but he did tell me I probably should’ve just let it go. Unprofessional? Maybe. But does escalating this situation make me TA?",AngrySalad3231,1484,130,0.9700000286102296,0.0630718074632105,1746485202,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kfpbnw/aita_for_confronting_a_parent_after_the_comment/,2025,5,AmItheAsshole,2025-05-05 22:46:42
1kpv0aq,AITA Didn't want to give up My Swim Lane?,"I swim at the Y several times a week. I always make my reservations for my swim lanes online and when scheduling it explicitly states that lanes specific lanes are not guaranteed only a lane for you will be available 

This is a multipurpose pool (family, lap, ect) and marked. 

On multiple occasions I have been bumped for various reasons (school needed the pool) but the most frustrating interruption in my workout was when a lady showed up demanding the lane I was in 20 minutes into my workout. She said it was her lane and she wanted to teach her kid to swim 

I didn't love moving but decided it wasn't the hill to die on that day. 

Flash forward to today and 10 minutes or so into my workout she shows up, kid in tow and tells me it's her lane and I need to move. 

I told her that lanes weren't assigned in that way and I want to be let alone to continue my workout. 

She didn't care for that answer and went and got staff who all acted like I'm an asshole who should've just moved 

It might seem petty but AITA really? This lady shows up and demands a lane and I'm supposed to care just cause she has a kid.

1lkjvjf,AITA for asking why they ignored the no dog sign.,"I (33M) went to a coffee shop this past weekend. As soon as I open the door I'm hit with a dog looking at me at hip level sitting on a chari n this small shop.  The dog is indoors and the door had a clear no pets sign.  I watched for a second, this clearly wasn't a service animal as she was letting it interact with several other guests.   

I asked her why she ignored the no pets sign?  She ignores me.  I asked her did you miss the no pets sign?  She immediately says I think you should stop harassing me.   All I was doing was asking why she ignored the no pets sign.  This lady played the victim and called me an asshole.   

Another patron steps up for her and the dude says why's it an issue? Who cares?   Tells me don't be an asshole and drop it. I wave the guy off, tell him I care, and I don't like dogs.  I say it's not hard to not bring your dog to a coffee shop that doesn't allow dogs.  By that point it's my time to order, I complained to the employee who didn't seem interested in enforcing anything. The owner left on her own.  AITA?

1l542ki,"AITA for not bringing my niece shopping after she was extremely rude/mean to me, even if she “apologized”?","I’m 26F and do not have kids, and I also have not really had a lot of experience dealing with kids before my niece. I don’t have younger siblings or cousins, I never babysat, etc. I’m explaining this because this is my blind spot and why I’m posting.

About a month ago, my niece “Gabby” and I were at the park together. I like to spend time with her and usually take her out to do things just the two of us every couple of weeks. While we were at the park, I was talking about an event I am going to attend with my boyfriend of a few years. She asked to see my dress, so I showed her a pic of me in it.

She made a “yucky” face and said “That’s soooooooo ugly. You look really fat. Isn’t \[\[my boyfriend\]\] gonna think it's bad?”

I was so hurt. She’s only 13! I’m not even a big girl in any sense. I have fat on my body, but I am definitely not fat. 

My sister was surprised and said she would talk to her. A few days later she had Gabby come over to apologize. From my POV, it was not sincere. She was rolling her eyes and looked angry and just got out the words. I told her thank you for apologizing and then told them to leave. I have not gone out my way to spend time with her since.

I had told Gabby that I would take her shopping for the summer and we’d pick out fun stuff together. I look forward to doing things like this with her. Not really anymore. When we were at my mom’s house for mother’s day, Gabby asked me when we would go.

After her stunt I’ve changed my mind. I said that she probably has plenty of summer clothes to wear. She was upset and said “But I said I was sorry!” over and over. 

I told her that I know she said she was sorry but just because someone says they’re sorry to you doesn’t mean that your actions are forgiven. That you have to prove to the other person you won’t do it again, and she hasn’t. 

My mom and sister say I’m expecting adult behavior from a child and that it was ridiculous to cancel the shopping date. I am apparently beefing with a child at my big age. They said that she apologized and hasn’t said anything else rude to me since. They asked how long I’m going to hold it against her. 

I really don’t know how to take this. I trust their judgment most of the time. But this was just an outright mean thing from her. I am worried that as she grows up this behavior will continue and she will turn out to be a bully.

1lghj66,AITA for telling my BIL he needs to book a hotel when he and my sister were staying at my house?,"My sister and her husband live across the country and decided they wanted to come visit. I live in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom and I set up a bed in my home office because they wanted to stay at my house. They had been here for 4 days. 

The bathroom has been a big problem. He spends hours in there. After the first day, I talked to my sister about it. She says he has a condition where he needs the bathroom a lot. So I let it rest. On day 3, it was even worse. There was a time where I had to excuse myself to go to the store so I could use the bathroom twice because he wouldn’t leave. 

The last day i woke up at 4am and had to use the bathroom very badly. I knocked on the door and he said he’d be out in a minute. I told him I really had to go. It took him an hour to get out. The nearby store wasn’t open at that time and I had to do something I am not happy I had to do because I couldn’t wait. 

The next morning I told him he needs to get a hotel. I can’t be blocked from using the bathroom in my own home because he takes it hostage. I get he has a condition, but so do I. And I make sure I have my own bathroom when I travel so I don’t get in the way of other people needing the bathroom. 

My sister and her BIL were very upset and called me ableist. I told them what I had to do last night because he was in the bathroom for so long and they said I could’ve held it. I told them they need to leave and find a hotel or stay with other family, he just can’t stay here anymore.

1l6o14h,"AITAH telling Sil my kids will follow my rules on vacation not her ""rules""","So my family me f38 hubby m38 son 12 and daughter 10 will be joining husband's family on vacation. (His mom/dad, his sister/bil and his brother/wife/ 3 kids f/f/m). We have vacationed with this group before and it goes well except for my sil. She is a narcissist and expects me to follow her rules with my kids so her kids don't melt down. Like no snacking 2 hrs or less before a meal. Only water with meals. Stuff like that.  Her middle daughter has ODD and her son has ADHD. And tend to melt down often. So now on to the situation. We were at the in-laws discussing dinner for the week as each group will take a night to purchase and prepare dinner for everyone. My kids are not picky eaters, but obviously have things they don't like. Both my kids hate potatoes. (Only eat French fries) Sil reminded us that her one daughter has a severe peanut allergy and mild seafood allergy. My 12yr old said awe man I forgot about that. I wanted fish tacos for dinner. (We are going were seafood is amazing) hearing this sil raised her voice at my son and said...""yeah lets have fish tacos so my daughter dies"" ""great idea"" my in-laws and I  snapped back saying that was not what he meant. He was not demanding we have fish. So I'm already irritated with her. When she announces she will make chili my heart drops. My sil puts cubed potatoes in her chili. My husband says to my son. Guess you won't be eating chili that night your Aunt puts potatoes in her chili. Sil loses it and says to my son well that's how I make it so deal with it. My son says ok I'll just have a sandwich that night. Sil says no you won't. You eat what's served or don't eat anything that's the rule. I say no it's not the rule and he most definitely can eat a sandwich that night.  Sil replies absolutely not. My kids eat what is served or they don't eat. If your kids start that carp then my kids will expect the same treatment so your kids need to follow the rules. I said my kids will follow my rules and my rule is son can have a sandwich instead of chili end of story. Sil starts to say something and my father in law says everyone quiet!! I paid for this trip so if anyone has a say in rules it's me...my rules. So my rule right now is drop the dinner disagreement  and move on. The rest of the night went OK. However when leaving my husband's brother told him I over stepped and we all know how his kids get if they are set off so  just make your son eat the damn chili. He can pick out the potatoes. On the way home we decided we will skip family dinner that night and go out to eat.  Hubby called his dad and told him our plan. His dad said that's fine. This is a family vacation, but everyone is allowed to do as they want with their families.

1ld8i4o,AITA for making my 14 year old fend for himself ?,"My son is 14. Up until the last several months I’ve done everything for him. Never made him lift a finger.

Then my husband and I had a miracle baby.

After I brought her home it became clear that I was not the spring chicken I once was and I was going to need some help. 

I started making my son do his own laundry. 
If he asked me if something was clean I asked him whether or not he washed it.

I bag up the trash and put it beside the can and tell him to take it out. 
( before I was ALWAYS the one taking it out )

I don’t go in his room and pick up , vacuum or make sure he doesn’t have a bunch of fast food wrappers , snack wrappers on the floor.
I just leave them there.

My husband thinks I’m being too harsh , he’s just a kid and to cut him some slack.

I grew up with siblings and we had an actual chore list but my husband disagrees and is holding that I had a rougher and more difficult Childhood and to not enforce that on him.

AITA help ?

1l2r4cg,AITA for giving my wife a dirty plate to eat off of at dinner,"My wife is a nurse, and she works long hours; therefore, I handle everything in the household.She has been picking up more shifts recently because the hospital is understaffed. I am the one doing the chores, taking care of the kids, making food, and I also work.  It's all me. She has one chore, and that is when she comes home, she needs to do the dishes

The kids are usually asleep by the time she gets home, so I usually make dinner for the kids and wait until she gets home to reheat the food for her. The main issue is that she has not been cleaning the dishes. I have talked to her multiple times, but nothing has changed. She gets home, eats, and goes right to bed. She always claims she is too tired after her shift to do the dishes, and when I suggest she does them in the morning, she claims there is not enough time before she needs to get to work.

It is extremely frustrating to wake up and they are not done, that leads to me having to do the dishes at some point. We talking about this agin last Saturday and she has not done the dishes since (four days of not doing them) and I have not done them either. I have ran out of dishes and served dinner to the kids on paper plates tongiht. She got home after the kids were asleep and I handed her a dirty plate to eat off of. 

I told her that she can use that to reheat the food. We was not happy and we got into an agrument. She called me a dick for handing her a dirty plate to eat off of and that I was home so I would have cleaned some dishes. I pointed out that this is her job and I am not going it.

1l6pxot,AITAH? I don’t want my husband coming on a family cruise,"I (50f) have been with my (52m) husband for 24 years. Over the past few years, he’s aged in dog years. My fun-loving, energetic happy husband has become someone who only sits and stares at the wall. When he’s not doing that, he’s sleeping. Without interference, he would sleep for 20 hours out of every 24. He’s been like this for 4 years now, has seen 20 doctors and takes three pills for each one he saw. 
In January, he broke a bone in his foot walking up the stairs because he developed a heel wound and didn’t tell anyone. Bone infection = weak bones. Since then, he’s been hospitalized three times, had two surgeries (currently has a large external fixator on his right ankle/leg that resembles like a metal halo) and two more planned. I have to give him IV antibiotics twice a day through his PICC line(second round of 6 weeks) as he can’t see well enough to do it himself. He gets daily wound care to his heel from visiting nurses that I have to do 4 days a week because they will only come three times a week. Plus, I have to change it every time the dressing falls off which is another 2-3 times a week. As you can imagine, he cannot work which forces me to carry every burden we have. I have had to work more hours to support the entire family. I have to clean our house, cook every meal, pay the bills, food shop, car maintenance, arrange and go to medical appointments. I just had to fix the garbage disposal that my husband dropped a fork into and our youngest’s scooter got a flat . . . Oh, did I mention we have two daughters, 21 & 12? We do or rather, I do. If someone is awake but spaced out only 4 hours a day, can you really call them a parent?
A year ago, we booked a cruise for the family. A week in the Caribbean, water parks, snorkeling, sight-seeing, shows, food, you name it. We have all been looking forward to it but I am desperate to go. I’m mentally and physically exhausted. I need a vacation, a break. I’m being pulled in every direction 24/7. 
We learned two days ago that the large metal apparatus in his foot is not coming off anytime soon. Plus, the wound is healing incredibly slow. My husband and I talked about the cruise. It’s in a month. He says he is going. I told him that I didn’t think he should. I told him I needed a break. That he can’t do anything once we are there (he can’t swim or submerge the leg with the fracture). That he isn’t supposed to be up and around as he’s ordered to be non-weight bearing on the one leg. I told him it would be completely unfair to me and the girls as I would be forced to nurse him and push him everywhere in a wheelchair while our daughters would feel guilty about leaving him behind and going anywhere. How is that fun? I explained all that and more. He says he’s going. He will just sit in the casino with all the money he doesn’t have. I told him ‘no’. He’s mad and sulking. So, AITAH?

1ld6790,AITA for telling my DIL that I will never be her mother and to leave me alone,"This is mostly about my daughter-in-law (Kat). Her mother ran out on her when she was a child, and she went into foster care. According to my son, she’s currently seeing a therapist.

My issue with Kat is that she has repeatedly stomped on my boundaries. She’s a very touchy person, she  refuses to call me by my name and only refers to me as “Mom.” I correct her every time since I’m not comfortable being called “Mom” by her, and I want her to use my name.

There have been multiple times where she’s asked inappropriate questions, mostly about why I’m not close to my own mother. (For context, my mother was horrible) Kat keeps pushing for details and insists I should get closer to her because “family sticks together.” She basically tells me to forgive my mom, and she doesn’t understand not being close with one’s parents. I’ve told her to drop the topic multiple times, and she refuses. Because of all this, I’m not a huge fan of hers.

I’ve spoken to my son about it, and he asked me to be patient. I’ve also talked to Kat multiple times and asked her to respect my boundaries. She always says she will, but then goes right back to ignoring them.

This is where I might be the jerk: My daughter Sam (20) and I are taking a weekend trip. Sam has medical issue and needs to see a specialist a few states over. She hasn’t disclosed the issue to the rest of the family yet (she plans to when she has a firm plan).

Somehow, word about the trip got back to Kat, and she called me asking why she wasn’t invited. I told her it’s an important trip and not a fun one. She accused me of lying, claiming it was a “mother-daughter” trip that she was excluded from. I told her again this is not a girls’ trip. She wouldn’t let it go and started demanding that she come, saying that she’s my daughter and needs to be there. I said no again. She kept insisting, saying I am her “mom”and she has to come on this trip since is my kid. That’s when I snapped. I told her I will never be her mother. Just because she married my son does not make me her parent. I told her to leave me the fuck alone and that even if this was a mother-daughter trip, she still wouldn’t be invited, because she isn’t my kid. I then hung up. 

My son says I need to apologize and invite her. That I am a huge dick to her. That I was way out of line and need to make it up to Kat. The situation has spread to the rest of the family, and everyone seems to have their own opinion. Sam is getting flack too, which isn’t helping especially since she doesn’t want to disclose the reason for the trip yet.

1llepvm,AITA for telling a woman to keep her comments to herself in an elevator?,"This happened earlier today. I was waiting for the elevator in my office building. The doors opened, no one was directly in front of me, so I stepped in. A woman and an elderly couple were just behind me, but I hadn’t seen or heard them until after I got on.

As soon as I stepped in, the woman complained out loud that I didn’t let her on first. I was caught off guard, but I apologized and said there was plenty of room for everyone, so it wasn’t a big deal. I wasn’t trying to cut anyone off; I genuinely didn’t notice anyone behind me.

She got on with the couple but kept going, saying how rude I was, how I had no manners, how people like me are what’s wrong these days, stuff like that. This went on for at least a minute, maybe more, and eventually I snapped a bit. I raised my voice and said Could you just keep your comments to yourself.

She went quiet, but the old couple sort of whispered something to her and gave me a look. Now I’m wondering if I just confirmed whatever idea they had about me, like maybe I actually was the jerk here.

I honestly didn’t mean to offend anyone. I just wanted to ride the elevator in peace.

During the divorce process, he agreed to pay me 250K for my share of our house. The court gave him until June of last year to pay me the full amount. He paid me 210K and said he would get me the rest as soon as he was able. (We both put 100k down when we were married to get the house in the first place). He signed a legally binding divorce agreement. I last spoke to him in December about when I could expect the rest of my money. He told me he didn't know. He did say that he wanted me to come pick up the rest of my stuff I had in the old storage shed. I told I could get it when I got back into town after the holidays and he told me no, get it before Jan 1. I canceled my trip home to see my family just for him to take a hammer to everything and leave it in the street Christmas morning. That's when I went to my lawyer and filed contempt charges.

He will return some things he chose to keep rather than smash. If I decline, he will have 30 days to sell the house. I don't want to make a decision in anger. He loves that house and wants to die there. I don't need to force the timeline for the money but he has dragged this process out for years (being a no show to court, ducking service, refusing to sign the papers, requesting continuances for hearings etc). Maybe he will pay me in six months and he can still keep the house but part of me wants him to finally suffer the consequences of blowing off his legal responsibilities.

1lh9z5y,AITA for ordering fries instead?,"This is one that's been haunting me intermittently for the majority of my life. I've been called an asshole several times over this, and finally decided to poll a larger group about it.

Where I live, there's a local mom and pop drive in restaurant that's been open and family run for about 70 years now. They open every spring and stay open until October. They sell north American classics - burgers, hot dogs, onion rings, French fries, and a variety of different ice cream cones, sundaes and milkshakes. I'm 30 and have been going there all my life. The food is always great.

Here's my apparent crime: when I and a group of my friends or family or inlaws all pile in the car and go to the drive-in, they all tend to order some kind of cold sweet treat. Shakes and cones, etc. But I am a) lactose intolerant and b) a fiend for french fries. So 9 times out of 10, I go against the grain and order fries instead of any ice cream. In the spirit of full disclosure I WILL say that I am 100% one of those lactose intolerant people who ignores it and takes the L to eat dairy when it suits me. I just prefer the fries, or maybe sometimes a hotdog, over ice cream.

The cooked food and the frozen desserts get served up out of two different windows with two different lines, and the ice cream line definitely moves faster. 

So for about 20 years now, I've been getting intermittently complained at and criticized for ordering fries when everyone else ordered icecream, and therefore holding up the entire group for an extra 5 to 10 minutes to get my food, so we can all leave. It's apparently very inconsiderate of me to order something that takes longer than everyone else, when the whole rest of the group ordered from the quicker options. They're all getting what they want, they're not settling. It's just apparently rude of me to also get what I want. 

It's been several different friends, family members and inlaws now who've said this, ranging from 'playful jokes' to downright cranky bitching. Is it actually so bad of me to order something that takes 5 to 10 minutes more? It's not like I ask them to wait to eat, or anything.

1l7gavf,WIBTA if I told my wife to get off her phone and take care of the baby?,"the title basically says it all, but to add some detail - we have an 11 months old, I work full time, my wife stays home indefinitely taking care of the baby, that was a mutually agreed arrangement that couldn't work any other way as her income would have been less than half of mine. I would love to stay home if that was feasible 

my wife seems to have a common these days phone addiction, where she will be glued to the screen for hours either watching reels, videos or messaging or exchanging audio messages with friends. I have no problem with that, I'm on my phone often myself, it is what it is, that's the way most of us decompress in 2025, but I do see the difference in our ability to snap out of it - I'm on my phone in my downtime and I can drop it at a moments notice for example because the baby crawled to me or there is something to do, my wife on the other hand tunes out completely and doesn't see or hear anything around her. I also tend to pick my phone when work is done, the house is clean and the baby asleep, while she is on it in the middle of things - as we are going somewhere, getting ready, cleaning, putting baby to sleep etc

She is also on her phone a lot when I'm leaving for work and it's actually time to be actively engaged with the baby, to the point where the baby might be crawling after me as I'm closing the door or running to me as soon as I come back, which is stressing me out a lot. I also notice it a lot when I'm driving and my wife is in the backseat on a baby duty, but actually completely ignoring any crying or screaming, again, to the point that I have to reach back and give a pacifier or sing a song to get the baby to calm down as I drive

she gets very defensive whenever that's brought up, either turning it into ""well you are using your phone as well"" or ""well that's for work"" because she does some side projects online, which is fair, but the amount of the time she spends and the money it brings is nowhere close to making it worth it, nor is it actually taking most of her time on the phone

WIBTA for calling it out and saying that she needs to at least put in 8 hours of phone free baby time every day and then we can split the evenings?

UPDATE, since this is getting out of hand and I can't engage with everyone:

1) the question is framed in a provocative manner because this sub requires a clear conflict spelled out, no, I'm not actually looking to police my wife's phone time, but directionally I am concerned with the balance between baby needs / self-care via doomscrolling

2) I am not expecting 24/7 attention on the baby from my wife or myself, that wouldn't be possible or healthy, but I do think there is a time for naps/meals/independent play/active play + need for passive supervision for safety reasons and soothing as required and the conflict seems to be in where to strike the right balance 

3) I am not talking about neglect, obviously the baby is healthy and clean and well fed and is hitting all the milestones, that doesn't mean though that she is getting sufficient face to face time, including reading, playing, singing, being held etc

4) might be a cultural / regional norm, but I wasn't even aware that sitting in the back with the baby in the car or letting them sleep in the stroller/outside can be weird to anyone. In any case we are in agreement about that with my wife so that's not an issue for us, baby is happy with it too

5) I don't think ""crying it out"" is a legitimate parenting approach and my wife doesn't think that it is either, but she ends up unintentionally using it if distracted by the phone, which, when I'm there, means I need to drop anything I'm doing and tend to the baby, or if I'm not there, results _potentially_ in a inconsolably crying baby which I'm not a fan of.

6) I'm not the dad of the year nor attempt to look like one, but I do a significant portion of childcare and am very involved. Obviously everybody is still going to project whatever they/their partner/their gender stereotype is telling them, so I can't argue with everyone about my actual level of involvement. The issue is really about when I'm not there, so what I'm doing when I am there might make it more or leas fair, but won't fix it",SomeAd8993,2210,1572,0.8299999833106995,0.3131966387930868,1749502648,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l7gavf/wibta_if_i_told_my_wife_to_get_off_her_phone_and/,2025,6,AmItheAsshole,2025-06-09 20:57:28
1laurb1,AITA for telling my girlfriend that her using her accent in public alienates people from her?,"AITA for telling my girlfriend that her using her accent in public alienates people from her? 

So, my (27M) girlfriend (26F) and I are huge movie buffs; we are cinephiles and that's actually how we first met, through Letterboxd. We watch a lot of classic movies together, from the 30's and the 40's. (Sidenote: People, do not be afraid to watch old black-and-white films, please. Some of them can feel just as funny and affecting as new films). 

Now, on to the real problem. My GF's a huge fan of Katharine Hepburn, and insists on watching at least one of her movies every other day. However, recently, she's started imitating her speech patterns and mannerisms. 

For anyone who's interested, Katharine Hepburn didn't speak in an organic American or British accent. It was a weird mix of the two, called the Transatlantic accent. [This](https://youtube.com/shorts/UgrL-8RRyJE?si=fMvFetACdqb57ypQ) is what it sounds like. It isn't an organic or natural accent, but rather one that was taught to upper-class children and media personalities back in the day. 

My GF has exclusively started to use this accent in public, and with me, and it's weirding people out, and giving off a sense of entitlement. What makes it worse is that we're actually a bit more financially secure compared to our friends, which makes her seem bragging and shameless in front of them. I've tried to tell her, but she just ignores me.

1lm5b47,"AITA for telling my daughter she needs to grow up, and apolgize to her sister","My late husband died when my oldest daughter (Sofia) was 9 and my youngest daughter (Julie) was 2. Julie has zero memories of her biological dad. I started to date 4 years after his death and remarried 7 years later (Sofia was 16 and Julie was 9). Sofia wanted nothing to do with him and looking back was a dick to him. My husband (Jim) never tried to force Sofia to see him as a father figure, but Julie did see him as a father figure. She refers to him as Dad. Both girls have been to therapy, Sofia hated it and I actaully think it made the issue below worse. Julie like it and helped her overcome never knowing bio dad.

That was the main issue between Sofia and Julie, Sofia thought julie was abandoning and replaying their bio-dad.  Julie made it very clear that Jim is her dad and basically bio-dad doesn’t mean much to her since, she doesn’t remember him. Many fights and their relationship was strained. Therapy didnt help, separate and group were tried. 

It got better when Sofia went off to college and they had space. Julie (24) is getting married. She announced this during dinner last Saturday and asked for Jim to give her away. Sofia did not take that well and started telling Julie that she was a horrible daughter and that she is replacing dad.

The announcement was ruined and Julie told her not to come to the wedding. I pulled Sofia aside and told her that she needs to apologize to her sister for her outburst, that she is way too old for this and it is time for her to grow the fuck up. That is fine that she doesn’t see jim as her father but get over that her sister does. 

She was crying when I finished, told me it is my fault for getting remarried in the first place and had not contacted me since. I know she apologized to Julie but she won’t respond to any of my texts.

1lfnln7,"AITA for refusing to be an unpaid maid for my BFF? Am I wrong for telling her her expectations should be that her husband cleans THEIR house? Am I wrong for saying she should be grateful for the help I'm offering, not expect more?","
*Update at the bottom* I was planning to fly over and help my BFF kick labour into action the two weeks running up to her due date. I had planned to help out with the school run of her two other kids, take my bff on long walks and catch up on some good old British TV all day whilst they were at school.

At her hospital appointment on Monday she found out she needs to have the baby via C section, two weeks early. So about 24-48hrs after i get through her door. 

She called me all apologetic, I said yeah not ideal, there would be no TV anymore but I can at least help my bff with er two oldest whom I love. She  said yeah "" you'd need to have main responsibility for the household cleaning, dishes, cooking, hoovering etc""

I said nah, I can do a meal or two, wash up after a meal or two but I'm not cleaning your bathroom or your kitchen on my holiday with my own home I could clean when your husband is also there. (Two weeks paternity leave)

She got very upset with me, said that my pride is in the way of helping her, that I'm not willing to support both her and her husband. Said her expectations of me were to clean and look after the kids, and her expectations of her husband was to bond with the new one and IF he had time/energy for him to help me a bit with the housework, and if I wasn't willing to do that she'd refund my flight ticket.

Am I the arsehole or what? Is this normal expectation, should I still go and be the BFF she needs? Am I wrong for feeling like her expectations should be that her husband cleans THEIR house? Am I wrong for thinking she should be grateful for the help I'm offering, not expect more from me than her husband whom she CHOSE to have three children with?

EDIT: I am English,when I use the word ""holiday"" it  does not mean beach and hotel, it means the period of time when you are not at work, normally 4-6 weeks paid leave a year. Mine are usually used to help/visit my best friend. 

I paid for the tickets (like I usually do) hence the word refund

My flight is 2nd July. The original due date 19th July. My flight back 21st July.

I visited (hopefully visit doesn't mean the equivalent of holiday) three weeks before the previous child successfully. Best friend of over a decade, played at their wedding, given (and happily taken) title auntie by their first. 

Help with the two children under ten - so that they got time to just focus on the new one. So that includes everything a child must do throughout the day, bedtime, food, homework, take them to activities, iron school uniform, pack and make lunches...those that know know.

I'd normally clean during the adverts, it's the expectation that is getting me turned upside down. And the fact there's no more TV time. 😅

Update:
So I realise it is a split decision. Those that mean to say im the AH would happily take because they seem i am in a position to give (mother Theresa it) , and those that say i am NAH are identifying that having the ability doesn't mean to say I must (rich staying rich).
Morally I don't deem it appropriate to expect something you'll never be able to give yourself. My best friend would love to be able to think she'd one day be able to do this for me, hence why she thinks it's appropriate to expect, however she will never be able given the amount of dependables she has.

The majority of the AH comments wanted me to give give give as much as I can cause she needs needs needs. I won't stop trying to give to better my friends situation, but it's just like when a charity cause is asking for money, you don't empty your bank in donations, you give what your comfortable with that month, and should not be subjected to ""oh so little"" or ""we need donations of x and up"". 

The majority of the NAH comments meant it was appropriate to ensure self perseverance and demonstrate boundaries. It's true, even though we speak 24/7 her life isn't mine, and therefore any requests to put mine in a deeply compromised position to save her family from a choice the made knowingly is unfair. I love my best friend but, I don't feel comfortable being that selfless, not when I don't deem it necessary. If she was suddenly single mother no questions or demands needed, I'd step up, however she isn't. It took two to tango, they made three tangos, i shouldnt have to turn maid. They shouldnt expect more from me because I don't yet have children, your choice to have children shouldn't be my cross to bear.

How we're doing:
We're still maintaining our snap streak. A good long-term friendship has ups and downs, disagreement and union. Both parties are hurt but still care for one another, however this is her time to nest and get ready to be a family of five. For me, I got the time back  to focus on what I initially had planned for my first summer after purchasing a house. There is a mutual agreement that this time around I'm not going, and she has refunded the cost of the tickets. she will have her mom come as planned, they wear very easily of her ""help"" and often cut her trip shorter. I am the preferred help. But I feel when you want someone to slave about, you should be able to tolerate their personality. Cause at the end of the day, it wasn't her choice to have three children or her choice of ""partner"" for her daughter. Only a PAID cleaner can you expect a lack of (voiced) opinion cause they are paid to do the job and keep their opinion to themselves.

Side note: I hope someone high up in the educational department in the US fixes the comprehension levels expectations before one gets a GED /graduates highschool. It's been enlightening, I thought I was 100% correct but I wasn't. Thank you all for your comments and advice.

1ljpmdq,AITA for kicking my brother out after he insulted my wife?,"(Hi reddit made this account to get some insight into a situation)  
  
I (32M) have a younger brother (27M) who’s been staying at my house for the past month. He’s between apartments, and I offered our guest room to help him out. My wife Kara(30F) and I have been happy to have him until last weekend.

We were all watching TV and having a normal chat when my brother suddenly made a really nasty comment about Kara. For context, Kara recently switched careers (to something that makes her much happier) and is earning less right now. My brother joked “Haha, youre basically living off my brother, right? What a gold digger.” I immediately told him off. Kara looked shocked and hurt. She told him that was a rude and wrong. Instead of apologizing, my brother doubled down. He said something along the lines of “Well, I call it like I see it. Maybe if you weren’t so lazy and got a better job, you wouldn’t have to mooch off my brother.”  

At that point I got a little mad. I told him to get out of my house if he was going to disrespect my wife under our own roof. He scoffed and said I was “overreacting to a joke.” It didn’t feel like a joke to either of us. Kara was quietly tearing up at this point. I was furious and told him to pack his stuff right now. We got into a shouting match. 

Now a few days later, my parents are upset that I kicked him out and he has nowhere to go. They admit what he said was wrong, but they think I should have been the bigger person and just talked it out the next day rather than throwing him out immediately. I personally feel I did the right thing standing up for Kara. he is an adult and should deal with this stuff himself. 

My brother hasn’t apologized at all. He’s texted me basically blaming Kara for being sensitive. That makes me even angrier. However, a part of me wonders if I moved too quickly by kicking him out on the spot. 

My wife, for her part, thanked me for defending her and says I did the right thing. My parents say family is family and I should let him come back and just set some rules. I don’t want him back unless he genuinely apologizes, which doesn’t seem likely right now.

So, Reddit, AITA for kicking my brother out after he insulted my wife?

Edit: after some talking people in the comments (and someone in my DMs who showed me how to edit this post) I think I might rent him his own studio apartment in a  lower income neighborhood that I can afford.

One day they were over and one of my friends that they have yet to meet until that day was over as well . My other friend who did not give me the artwork looked up the art pieces through Google lens because they also liked them and wanted to get some for themselves. 

That friend found out that the artwork that was given to me was worth $1000 per piece . And I said wow, that’s an insane price. So the friend who gave me the art pieces told me that I needed to give them back to him. And he started taking him off the wall and I said absolutely not. You gave those to me. 

He started yelling at me because I wouldn’t give them back. Then he said I better pay him $3000 for all of them and I said no because you gifted them to me almost a year ago.

1l2nzr3,AITA for refusing to open my pool w/o a safety gate?,"This has been a matter of contention for three years between myself (F36) and partner (M47). He inherited his family home 3 years ago, which includes a large 20x40 foot pool with a 10’ deep end. The sliding glass door in the kitchen opens directly onto the pool area. For context, we have two kids together, age 5 & 3, and I brought three of my own into the relationship, 11, 12 & 17. 

Since we moved in, I have said the pool needs to be fenced in. The back yard itself is fenced in, so home owners insurance grants a policy. But there is no gate/fence/anything between the house and the pool. The slider also grants access to our detached garage, which holds his office, and my oldest son’s work shop. So the slider is utilized multiple times daily. Years one and two, I got child safe sliding door locks and alarms, trying to force everyone to go out the front door and around the house to access the garage. It didn’t work. Partner would still utilize the sliding door. Older kids would go out that door to access the garage. Even forcing everyone out the front door isn’t a fool safe because a younger kid can still run around the house, through the garage, or gate. 

Drownings happen fast. I get told “just watch them”. Yes, obviously. Youngest two are also in year two of swim lessons. I don’t feel comfortable without a gated pool, bottom line.

Here is my AITA? question. This summer, I’m refusing to open the pool until a six foot fence with a locking gate is installed around the entire pool. My older kids are giving me grief that I’m ruining their summer. Partner has said he doesn’t have time to install a fence, but won’t hire anyone because no one can do anything as good as he can. #sarcasm. Family is upset they can’t come swim.

1letyfj,WIBTA if I kicked my dad's girlfriend out of our home?,"I really need outside opinions because I don’t know if I am being super unreasonable.

My mum died when I was a teenager. In her will, she left the house to me but gave my dad a right to live in it until he dies. She inherited our family home from her parents so it was always just in her name.

Honestly I never thought of it as “my house.” Even though legally it is. I moved away for uni but after I got a good job back in our hometown, I moved back in. I have been living here again for a few years now. 

I guess I knew deep down that my dad must have dated over the years but he never talked about it and never introduced me to anyone and honestly I kind of liked it that way. I didn't want to know that he moved on. It was just us- him and me against the world.

His new girlfriend kind of appeared out of nowhere. I met her a couple of times and suddenly she moved in without any prior discussion. 

I was stunned but I tried to be happy for him. I really, really did. I tried my best to be polite and keep my resentment to myself. But it’s getting harder every single day. Every time I see them giggling in the kitchen or cuddled up on the sofa my mum picked out, I want to scream. My mum who died too young, who loved my dad, who was only ever with my dad, who never got a chance to move on. And now I have to watch him do it, every single day, in her house, in her childhood home. I didn't know I just feels like this is so disrespectful to my mum's memory.

She is redecorating. She has moved furniture. She changed the curtains and wallpapers my mum and I picked together and reorganised the kitchen cupboards.

And worse she has been making comments like, “Have you ever thought about living independently now that you are settled in your career?” Or telling my dad they will need to turn my room into nursery eventually when they have kids as the third room is his home office.

Like. What?? The absolute audacity.

I’m not a tenant or a guest. I own the goddamn house. My dad just has a right to live here but I don't think that right gives him the right to just move in a partner and act like it’s their shared marital home especially when I live here too. If he wants to build a life with her he should at least move out and not do it in my mum's home.

From what i understand she has no legal right to live here. She is not a tenant as she pays no rent. I think I can legally kick her out anytime i want to without a court order. At best she is an ""excluded occupier"" and can be evicted with reasonable notice which is classed as one rental period. And I don't think even that is applicable here.

I havent confronted him yet but I am this close to sitting my dad down and saying all this. And if he refuses, I am considering speaking to a solicitor and making it happen formally. I know it would cause a huge rift but i am so tired of feeling like a stranger in my own home. I feel like my mum is being erased.

1lfm8lr,AITA If I bought my boyfriend of 3 years the wrong gift for his birthday?,"  Hello. My name is Angie(33F). I have been dating my boyfriend Mark(32M) for 3 years. Today was his birthday and to celebrate I bought him a gaming laptop. The problem is that I guess I bought him the wrong one because he got mad at me saying that I should have just not wasted my money since I don't really know anything about computers. He specified saying that I got the one with a weaker gpu and cpu than the one he wanted to get.


  We got into an argument about it and he just left our apartments a couple hours ago and I have been sitting around pondering what I did wrong. I think I might be the asshole because the reality is I am in a better financial situation than him and the one he actually wanted he couldn't afford without putting it on a credit card. I have been texting telling him I want to talk it over with him and he keeps ignoring me. 


  
 TLDR: AITA If I bought my bf the wrong gift?

1lm814y,AITA: For telling my boyfriend no to an invitation to an all-inclusive resort (getting engaged) because his mom will be there.,"Myself (25 F) and my boyfriend (27 M) have been in a relationship for eight years. We have been planning to get engaged for the past year and the ring just arrived in the mail. Yes, we picked it out together, but the plan is that he would execute the actual proposal. He always said the proposal would be small and didn't want anything extravagant or in public, which I agreed to. Before we began picking out rings or ordering the ring, we were talking about going on a vacation with his mom. 

This vacation would be the first for him and his mom and they want it to be international. I was in agreement with this, as there are no issues between myself and his mom and they are really close. By close, I mean a pattern of her word before mine, him agreeing to her wishes, my opinion being put on the backburner. Yes, a momma's boy, but this is not the issue at hand, as I love them both and accept this about them. This just helps with the context of the situation. We all went together to get our passports and are now planning on going to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico. 

As far as I was concerned, I thought the proposal would happen sometime before or after this vacation. Today he mentioned wanting to propose while we're on vacation with his mom and I feel that this would:

 1. Make it so that we are unable to enjoy a romantic time together while his mom is present. 

2. Cause it to be uncomfortable for her as we may not spend as much time with her since we'll be celebrating.

3. Her praise for her son may overshadow our celebration and divide his attention.

I was very clear about not wanting his mom to be there, and he said that there would be no other way that he would want to propose because he wants it to be somewhere extravagant and away from where we live. His idea is that for the most part, she would be doing her own thing while we spend time together. I brought up the fact that if she wanted to do something without him, she would be going on vacations on her own. I also mentioned that my expectations are not that we need to be doing something special and if he was open to it, to get engaged before and keep the vacation separate/make it part of the celebration. He was not open to this idea either, so I offered to not go to save money for the trip, and plan something different for us, and now he's upset.

I really just want this to be a special moment between the two of us that we can share with our friends and family after the fact. His mom being there just makes it seem like I'm taking away time with her son from her or she's going to be taking away the joy of my engagement celebration. If this vacation was separate from the proposal as planned, I'd be so down to go.

1lns0j2,AITA for only paying for my pregnant sisters meals when I can verify them?,"My (30f) sister (24f) became pregnant with her first child this year. I'm very excited to be an aunt, but I have had to balance that excitement with difficult emotional choices about how much financial support to offer. 
My sister has lead a chaotic life in her teens to now, and frequently changes friends, where she lives, her phone number, etc. While I would love to be close to her, it can feel like walking into a hurricane. 
Now that she is pregnant without much income, I feel very guilty to turn down her frequent requests for money. However, when I do give her money, I try to go about it in a way where I can tell that the money is going to food and not something else. 
My sister doesn't do drugs, but the father of her child and on-off boyfriend has served time for federal drug charges for using and selling cocaine and heroin/fentanyl. I worry that the money I give her may end up going to something completly unintentional on my part due to his influence. 
Typically, when she asks for money, (often to order food) I ask if I can put the order in through the restaurant myself or see the DoorDash order. Usually this results in her asking other people for money instead. 
Am I being too hard on her during a rough period in her life? I want to support her, but not in a way that could hurt her later.

1liua1b,AITA for having fun at a beach while my friends waited in a Wendy's for 3 hours?,"Context: Me and 6 other friends went on a beach trip. The plan was to spend 2 days. We had booked a hotel for one night($1222) for which our friend said we could pay him back later. I paid for a rental van which we took there($571) which I also said everyone could pay us back later. 

The first day everyone went to the beach and was satisfied. The second day, 4 people in the group were not trying to go on the sand. Instead, they wanted to walk around the city around the beach. (For context this is Virginia Beach). Me, and 2 other people in the group wanted to go in the water. We brought the keys to the rental van with us since we were the only ones with licenses. We had planned to leave the beach by 7pm so 2 people in the non-beach going group could go to work the next day, while allowing us to fulfill our rental van dropoff for 2:30AM

While me and my 2 friends were in the water, the non-beach going group called us 5 times claiming that they wanted to leave early.(It was 4:57) and we didn't see the calls until we got out at 5:43. They said they were so exhausted that they sat and waited in a Wendy's for 3 hours. Me and the beach-going friends still wanted to get food. So we got the food and then we went to pick them up and go back home(This was 7 on the dot). My friend is giving me the silent treatment.

1l13qaj,AITA for speaking up about dogs in a food establishment (San Francisco),"I went to a local SF ice cream shop, just hoping to enjoy a treat like I usually do. When I walked in, I noticed two people eating inside with a dog that clearly wasn’t a service animal. Since it’s against California Health and Safety Code § 114259.5 to have non-service animals inside food establishments, I quietly let one of the employees know. She said she’d take care of it.

But after about 10-15 minutes, nothing happened. It felt like the staff wasn’t going to do anything, so I (probably naively) approached the two people myself and gently let them know about the law. That’s when things turned ugly. They told me the staff said it was okay, and when I explained that it actually wasn’t, they started being aggressive and mean, taking pictures of me, and threatening to put me on social media. I was honestly just trying to protect public health, not get into a confrontation. I ended up taking a photo too, just for my own safety.

The part that hurt most was that the staff didn’t step in or support me at all. The one who said she would take care of it said she had to go on break and was busy, and another said they didn’t know the law. I felt completely alone and kind of humiliated.

I love this shop and have been coming for years. I’m not trying to get anyone in trouble—I just wish the staff were better trained and willing to uphold the law so customers don’t have to be put in uncomfortable or even unsafe situations.

I’m tired of seeing dogs in cafes, bakeries, restaurants, etc. in SF and no one doing anything about it. But I also don’t want to come off as rude.

1l1u1e9,AITA for feeding my dogs before my stepsister?,"I (18F) live with my dad, his wife “Jackie”, and my stepsister Mia (13F). My dad was paralyzed from the chest down in a car crash in a car crash 5 years ago. Jackie and Mia moved in 4 years ago. We’re a very happy blended family. 

The only issue that I have is that Mia is kinda spoiled. She pretty much gets whatever she wants whenever. She’s usually a very sweet kid overall which is why I’m questioning if I’m being an asshole. Jackie left on a business trip last night. Before she left, I told her that I would handle making dinner, bringing Mia home from track practice, and general tidiness of the house. I would also continue to take care of my two very large Great Danes that I was given my grandmother. My family plays with and snuggles them, but they are my dogs. 

Mia’s chores were the dishes after dinner, bringing her dirty clothes to the laundry room door, and taking the trash out. It all seemed fine when Jackie left. 

Well I went to pick Mia up from track this afternoon and when she got into the car she asked for her snack. I said we had food at home, but I didn’t bring any. She said her mom always brought a snack for her and kinda pouted. 

When we got home, she stayed in my car when I went inside. I left with my dogs before she came in. When I returned, she was crying at the kitchen table. I asked why and she said that I hadn’t prepared a snack for her and she was so hungry. I told her she always had access to our pantry. She said it wasn’t the same because it’s always already ready for her. 

I went to feed the dogs and she asked where I was going. I told her and she started to scream cry at me that I was heartless and only cared for my “stupid animals” and that I needed to make dinner right that second. She then ran upstairs and slammed the door. 

I called Jackie and told her what happened. She was confused because Mia knows she’s always welcome to food. I know she’s adjusting to her mom being away.

1li0wze,AITA  for not letting my husband sleep in swim trucks?,"We had a chill day today that involved our pool (no drinking). We dried after reading beside it, I made dinner, we had a long conversation, watched a show and then it was time for bed. Even tired, I still took a quick shower to rinse my body before bed. Husband didn’t want to, fine, I didn’t complain. But he was in bed in his swim trunks so I asked when he was taking them off. He said he was sleeping in them.

Normally, he sleeps in his underwear only. I sometimes sleep in a t shirt that i only use in bed and undies, sometimes my birthday suit. It depends. And honestly, idk why it bothers me so much that his swim trunks were in bed, but to me they’re like dirty shorts. He’s worn them outside on dusty furniture, has cat fur all over them, doesn’t wash frequently, that kind of vibe. So it feels like outside clothes shouldn’t be in bed. I’m not a super clean person but any means, but I like my bed to feel clean.

He said he was too lazy to change into his underwear. No problem buddy, I’ll get them for you. Begrudgingly he changed into them, even though he didn’t want clean undies on his dirty body. I agree with that but prefer it over his dirty swimshorts in our bed. 

Anyways, I don’t like feeling like a control freak or nagging wife, I keep the bar pretty low in general, so I don’t always know when my requests/insisting is actually reasonable or if I’m being extra. My husband didn’t think there was any “rule” about what you’re allowed to wear to bed and I disagreed and said there’s an unwritten rule. He says he needs it in writing, so here I am.

1l5xyih,AITA for not letting my neighbor take my children swimming?,"I have 3 children between ages 3-8. Today my husband was supposed to take them to the park but he procrastinated and now it's too late because he has to leave out to an event. Our sweet next door neighbor ended up messaging us to see if the kids could join her child at the pool (our children enjoy playing together). My husband thinks this is a great idea since they were excited to go to the park but are no longer going. He told the children about this exiting new option to go swimming instead before bringing it to me. But I said no. I am 40 weeks pregnant, exhausted and it's much too hot for ME to go and sit at the pool w/ my children right now (which is why dad was supposed to do the park w/ them). I am sure my neighbor would not mind me sending them out by themselves because again she is so kind and sweet and I don't think for one second that they will be unsafe with her. Sending THREE children w/ this lady to the pool all by herself on top of her own child is selfish in my opinion. I would also be the parent dealing with the aftermath of swimming like hair and baths etc. My husband thinks it's not fair to the kids because they now have to ""be stuck in the house all day with nothing to do"". They have plenty of toys, board games and a whole backyard to play in, as well as each other. They will be fine and again, had he moved faster then they would have been able to stick to the original plan and been back from the park by now. In his opinion there is no difference in sending them to the pool without me since I wasn't going to be joining them at the park. Now the children are upset and I look like the bad guy because I won't let them go to the pool.

1ljpb3e,WIBTA if I don’t attend my daughter’s wedding because her father will be there?,"
28 yrs ago, my daughter’s father left us for our babysitter just a week after her 1st birthday. He had 2 kids with her, & left her for their babysitter as well. Moved across the USA and married her. Our daughter didn’t see or hear from him at all. No emails, calls, no child support. When she was 14 we discovered she was bipolar & put me thru hell, even with medication. Fast forward 28 years. Found out lots of things, including that he had people spying on me all those years & reporting back to him on what I was doing. “He was worried about the kids with me as a parent.” (For context - I raised 7 kids (this daughter Is child #4, mostly as a single parent, by my own choice. I never had a welfare check, went thru college 3 times for 3 different  degrees and never had the electric shut off, go to a shelter or was homeless.) he Never sent any messages, emails, phone calls, birthday card, anything. Now, I’m raising said daughter’s son, he is 9 and I have had him since he was 1 due to neglect and emotional abuse. He will soon be 10. She visits with him when it’s convenient for her, which isn’t often. Her boyfriends have always been twice her age and way more important to her than her son. One bf went to prison. We have full legal custody and have the right to tell her no any time we like, but for the boy’s benefit, we figured some contact is better than none. He is in counseling and his counselor has ripped her a new ass twice. He said “either be all in or be all out.” She just can’t seem to do either one. She also didn’t pay child support for 7 years, but the last 18 months they ordered her to pay $60 a month, which we discovered her father has been sending her to pay. She cant hold a job or a place to live. He gave her a BMW & drove it here. He’s given her thousands of dollars & paid her rent. He has said some vile stuff about me that has gotten back to me. I feel like both of them has really made a lot of my adult life a lot harder than it has had to be. While they’re off living it up & having fun, being all “lovey dovey family” while I’m over here exhausted and struggling. While I went on with my life and I have a wonderful man now….my daughter and her twice her age flavor of the week are talking about getting married. He hs had a vasectomy, doesnt ever want kids and has no desire to be in this boy’s life, let alone encourage her to do it. Good for her, if that’s what makes her happy. However, I have zero desire to attend that wedding, especially if her father is there and giving her away. Their relationship is not my business and I hope it’s a happy one, but I really have no desire to have all that rubbed in my face. It’s like neither one ever gave a shit how their behavior affected my heart, soul, or life. Would I be an asshole if I choose not to attend?

1lleol5,AITA for hiding my pregnancy from my sister?,"I (28F) am over 3 months along, and I'm worried if I tell my sister (21F) that shes going to try to get pregnant too... again.

Two years ago I had my first pregnancy. I announced it to my family at dinner and everyone was very happy and supportive of me. Ive been with my bf (34M) for 5 years now and it seemed like everything was falling into place for our midwest life. But my sister is a narcissist, and saw how happy and excited everyone was for me and decided she wanted that for herself. She made it her mission to also get pregnant, while in college, with no job or place of her own. She got pregnant within the next 2 months while at school and expected everyone to also be excited. Obviously she got a different reaction and was really mad at everyone for not just accepting her irresponsible choice. She ended up dropping out. 

Fast foward to my emergency c-section where we fought to keep my baby alive in the NICU, only to pass away at 9 days. I don't want to get into the details of it,  but obviously it was traumatic. And my sisters world completely changed from thinking we would be raising kids together. Her baby was born on time and healthy. And I hate to say but shes a terrible mother. She doesnt prioritize her child at all, doesn't even capture milestones or spend quality time with him, just dumps him on a family member for a few days so she can go out. To each their own but its extremely infuriating, considering how motherhood was ripped away from me and she doesnt have a maternal bone in her body. 

Now 2 years later, shes still in the same spot. No job, living with her mom, doesnt prioritize her child and didnt go back to school. He isnt speaking words and just grunting and is developmentally delayed. I see this and it makes me realize she didnt really want a kid, she just wanted that unconditional support from our family that they showed me. So now that im pregnant again, I really dont want to tell her. And my family has agreed with me not to tell her. I'm worried shes going to see that as an opportunity to get pregnant again because shes obsessed with attention whether its negative or positive, and can't stand the spotlight on me. But i feel bad the further along I get, and the more people I tell, shes going to be extremely upset when she finds out. And if you know narcissistic rage, then you understand.  I figured maybe I'd tell her this weekend finally, BUT she just posted on her story ""going crazy this summer bc i'm manifesting a babygirl next year."" Like HUH? You cannot keep a job, you dont even help your mom with rent and you want to have a 2nd kid already? For WHAT? You aren't even a good mother to your first! The father wants to take him for custody! Makes me want to shake her by the shoulders ugh. Now I know when I tell her shes definitely going to try it again. 
I rarely see her and we arent technically that close, so I could hide this for as long as I wanted tbh. AITA? or are my fears valid? 

Edit: I understand the concern for my nephew. My family is all for the father getting custody, my sister is the only one against it. We all see her for who she is, but she doesn't seen anything wrong with her actions.Hes only 2 right now. She doesn't think shes a bad mom. He and my sister both live with her mom, my step mom, who is a school teacher. She does as much as she can to help him while also still trying to maintain her own life, but she doesn't want the entire responsibility of raising a child and I'm sure thats understandable.

She told me to stop laughing cause it’s a horror film and not a comedy. I could not help it, I was laughing so hard at the first death sequence. I just found the whole Goldbergian chain of events that caused said deaths to be hilarious. I was the only person laughing in the theatre. 

She was not happy and was pissed off on the way home. She said I ruined the tone of the film. I tried to stifle my laughter and some of the deaths I didn’t find funny so I didn’t laugh during them. But when a funny death did happen I couldn’t help but laugh.

1l7j8s9,AITA for returning the jewelry my husband gave me for our 10 year anniversary?,"Hey reddit, long time reader and possible asshole here. My Husband (34M) bought me (32F) a beautiful necklace and earring set for our 10 year anniversary. He had it professionally wrapped and included three different types of liquor filled chocolates in the box. It was stunning, my favorite color, and I was SO appreciative of the time and effort he took in picking out a set I would truly like. Here's the problem. During this time my husband, we'll call him E, and I were struggling, not only in our relationship but with finances as well. E would spend most nights out with friends while I was home with our kids. We had many disagreements about his drinking, partying, and late nights. Because of everything that was going on I had chosen to take a break from alcohol. E knew I wasn't drinking so I was somewhat disappointed when I saw the chocolates. Now, I have never been much of a jewelry person but I was very happy with the set E got me. I had planned on wearing it the next day but forgot in the whirlwind of getting kids ready for school. E asked me why I wasn't wearing it that afternoon and said that if he was going to have to go hungry to afford the set he hoped I would at least wear it. I immediately felt terrible that I forgot to wear it and that it cost so much. I asked him how much he spent and it was enough to pay off a few bills and reduce some of our stress financially. Knowing that and how my husband wasn't able to eat lunch for the week I didn't feel right wearing the set. During that time, he continued to ask why I wouldn't wear the necklace and reminded me that he wasn't able to eat lunch because of what it cost. Now, this is where I might be the asshole. I took the set back to the store he got it at, told them I didn't like it, and returned it. It broke my heart to return it but they were able to give me a full refund minus a small fee. I took the money and paid off a few of our debts and said nothing. With how little I wear jewelry I had hoped he wouldn't notice after some time had passed. Unfortunately, someone he knew was in the store and saw me return it. A few days later E and I had a long conversation about how hurt he was. I apologized and explained why I returned it and how sad I was that he would choose to go hungry to get me something material. Shortly after we decided to go to therapy together and things have gotten better. However, I noticed for the last several holidays E hasn't gotten me anything, not even a card. He says it's because I'll return anything he gets for me. This has become a recurring disagreement between us where he says I'm the asshole. So reddit, am I the asshole for returning the jewelry my husband gave me for our 10 year anniversary?",Nearby_Zebra_8889,1727,437,0.9100000262260436,0.1235097128025792,1749509990,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l7j8s9/aita_for_returning_the_jewelry_my_husband_gave_me/,2025,6,AmItheAsshole,2025-06-09 22:59:50
1l7gk9l,AITA for involving myself and angering the new neighbors?,"I(33f) live in a culdesac with 5 other house on my street. 3 of these houses have motorcycles. Now, i must say, the bikers are really respectful of noise. One gets home late, one leaves early and they walk their bikes to the end of the road before they start them so they dont disturb the gaggle of young children in the neighborhood. Often times, you will see the bikers giving kids rides around the circle. All in all, fantastic neighbors. 

On to the issue. Recently, the only empty house on our street was bought by a young family. Mom and dad look to be in their early to mid 20s, and the kids look to be maybe 3 and 5. Mom started making a fuss the moment they moved in over the bikes. ""They are too loud"" ""they shouldnt have bikes around such young kids"" and finally ""they keep waking my kids up in the middle of the noght"". Most of us ignored them until they yelled at my neighbor for driving thru at 2pm on a Saturday. He was driving under the speed limit and he was making a normal amount of noise.

I was outside when she started walking towards him and his bike, screaming about the bikes and horrible neighbors. I got up, walked over and yelled back that she moved into OUR neighborhood and she could clearly see the bikes when they were viewing the house. She turned on me telling me i was a monster for allowing my kids near that death trap and it was ridiculous that i hadnt complaimed yet. I told her she was a crazy b-word and to stay off both of our properties, that she and her family could keep to themselves and could go suck a catcus.

She wont so much as look at me now but one of our neighbors said that i was being a dick and that it was a hell of a way to welcome them to the community. I do feel bad now because i hate to speak to people like that.

My younger sister 30F booked the camping site and we all paid our share to her 101 each. My sister had decided not to bring her dog or invite my younger brother and his 3 young kids ages 2-6 because she did not want to spend her vacation babysitting,she wanted to drink and relax. My older brother and I agreed as we both work high stress jobs and just really need a break. That brings us to today my sister calls me and informs me that my 6 year old niece will be joining us and that we will be baby sitting her for the trip. I am now considering dropping out of the trip for a few reasons, one I feel blindsided that my sister offered to bring our niece along without consulting anyone first. Also I know she did not contact my older brother about this as she knows he would not be okay with taking her. I adore my niece but babysitting her is really taxing she has severe ADHD and is prone to screaming fits when ever she is told no. So I feel that if I go on this trip it will absolutely not be the relaxing trip I have been looking forward to for months.

1l4axpl,AITA with refusing to reconcile with my wife's friend after being accused of cheating?,"My wife and I have been together for 7 years. There has never been any infidelity on either end. When we moved into our current apartment last year, my wife befriended a couple up the hall, Anna and Sarah. Anna has the view of ""all men are horrible monsters."" She's entitled to her opinion and I get where she's coming from to some extent.

Over Memorial Day weekend, my wife left town to visit some family. On Friday night, I went to the corner store and got myself a 6 pack of beer, hopped on discord with a buddy, and painted some Warhammer 40k figures. Before I started painting, I took my ring off to avoid getting any primer, paint, etc on it.

I forgot to put my ring back on before bed. The next morning I went out to get some coffee and ran into Anna and Sarah on my way back in, chatted for maybe 2 minutes. 10 minutes later my wife calls me and asks why I'm not wearing my ring. I tell her that I must have forgotten to put it back on after painting. I also asked her how she knew I wasn't wearing it. Apparently, Anna took a picture of me while we were speaking and sent it to my wife with a message that basically said ""The first time you go out of town and his ring off. He's probably cheating on you"" 

My wife immediately believes me and told me as much. Just to ensure there were no doubts, I sent her my location history showing the only time I left the apartment on Friday was to get beer and a picture of my work-in-progress figures (Custodes, IYKYK).

My wife returned Monday and told me the following. After we spoke on the phone she messaged Anna saying that she appreciates being looked after, but that I wasn't up to anything nefarious and had even provided proof. Anna replied that I likely had this all planned out and had my 'proof' at the ready and only had to use it because I 'got caught.' I ask my wife, what would Anna like to see to prove that I basically spent my Friday night doing the OPPOSITE of cheating? I feel a bit attacked and offered for Anna to come over and read the discord chat history between my buddy and I, which is full of back-and-forth links and 40k pictures from 7pm until midnight when I logged off. My wife says I'm turning this into nothing, and insisting I'm innocent is only going to make Anna dig in her heels.

Next weekend they are having a picnic and Sarah invited us. I tell my wife that she should go without me, I don't feel like spending any time around Anna, who clearly does not respect me and thinks I'm a serial cheater with no morals. I don't want to spend the afternoon getting the side-eye from her, and I have some anxiety that she's going to (or already has been) gossipping about me. My wife thinks I should extend an olive branch by coming to the picnic with some cookies and telling Anna that I appreciate that she's looking out for my wife, but nothing happened. I feel like I did nothing wrong and that getting back in Anna's good graces is not warrented.

1le15s2,AITA refusing to pay my friend for her package that was delivered to me?,"Hi reddit! I need your take on something rq. Also throw away acc because I don't know who's on here, lol.

I 19, female and my friend 20 female are currently having an argument over the stupidest thing ever.

Here's the context. So, I order things from online A LOT and recently, I ordered a few things from a popular brand. Now, my packages were spilt up so what I ordered would've come on two separate days(far apart) which I didn't mind. 

I picked up the first package and a week or so later, I kept seeing notifications in my email about a package(completely different tracking number than either of my split up packeges) pop up. I checked my bank account to see if maybe I had ordered something and didn't remember but that wasn't the case.

I brushed it off and ignored it. A few days later, the mystery package and my original package came up as delivered so I went and collected both since they were BOTH addressed to me. For the mystery package, I paid 50$ to clear it. 

As soon as I got home, I dug through the mystery package since I paid a good buck to collect it, was awfully curious and I thought the company gifted me free items since I shop on their site quite often. There were slippers, shorts, dresses and a few other things in the package all which I'd never personally order but they were good picks. I gave away one of the dresses and currently am wearing one of the shorts while typing this lol. 

Now, the actual tea. My friend sent me a message today asking if I had received a package recently(i picked up the package a week ago and we talked. I did mention getting freebies and it didn't go beyond that) and I said yes and obviously started telling her about my freebies(again). She asked what exactly I got, I told her then SHE said it wasn't free since it was HERS. How? Well, she placed an order from the same site I buy from and put MY address in to have it delivered to ME. Did she ever tell me about this before today? No. Am I shocked and lowkey upset? Kinda, yeah because why wouldn't she tell me that? I told her I took two items since I initially thought I was mine and she could have the rest of her stuff. 

Now, the cause for the argument? She said I'd have to pay her back for the two items I took and I refused since I did pay 50$ to collect it(she no longer has to) and my other friend works close to where she lives so she'd get free delivery too. She called me selfish and a b-word(dunno if I can say that here) and has been telling our mutual friends and my mom about what happened. She's been saying I STOLE from her and refused to pay her back. My mom's saying I should pay her to keep the peace and my friends are split on the situation. So reddit, am I the ahole for refusing to pay back my friend after she ordered her package to be delivered to me?

P.s. I tried to edit this as much as possible, sorry for any typos.

1lmzbls,AITA for running away when he grabbed the umbrella?,"I (37F) went on a trip to a foreign country with my husband Joe (33M). This happened in December. We had been married about a year at that point.

The trip was during the rainy season. I absolutely hate when it rains on me, the way most people hate nails on a chalkboard. I normally quietly put up with it. But spending a week outside in a rainy season, it required a little more planning. But the solution seemed simple: umbrella. But I knew from experience that if Joe didn't have his own, he would grab it, hold it over his head, leaving me almost no protection. So, I said (emphatically) I'll bring an umbrella, but you must have your own. I don't want to share because it doesn't work.

He didn't bring his own, and didn't want to buy one when we saw one at a market. Near the end of the vacation, we were outside and it started to rain suddenly. I whipped out my umbrella, Joe immediately grabbed it, lifted it high, so it wasn't doing anything for me. Without thinking, I ran over to an open-air restaurant 30 feet away to get out of the rain. 

Joe started yelling at me across the distance saying I ""always do this"". He doesn't like explaining himself, so I'm not sure what ""always do this"" means. We rarely go anywhere, so it's not like I have a habit of running off - nowhere to run TO. I was not upset with him in that moment. I understood he grabbed it without thinking. My only thought was to get out of the rain. Everyone in the restaurant stopped talking and looked at us. It was embarrassing (and rude I thought).

Later that night in the hotel we got into a big argument. I said I didn't like him yelling at me in front of everyone. These talks are never constructive. He kept insisting that I was mad at him about the umbrella. I was slightly annoyed after the fact is all, but he didn't believe me. If he hadn't yelled at me, everything should have been fine. The rain died down and we could have resumed our walk no problem. But he kept pressing me and I finally asked why didn't he get his own umbrella if he was going to be upset when I took cover after he basically took mine? He said, and I quote, ""This is why all my friends think I'm pussy-whipped,"" which cut me to the core and I'm second-guessing everything now.

Am I the asshole for how I acted when he grabbed the umbrella? Maybe I shouldn't have gone to cover without saying something first or maybe I should have asked him to try to adjust the umbrella. He doesn't make a habit of yelling at me and doesn't often mad at me, but does get mad when I'm upset with HIM. For my part, he does have a habit of telling me what I'm upset about, when it isn't true, and then being mad at me for what he says I'm upset about. It's like he WANTS me to be mad at him for something unreasonable. But for his part, I know I can be too sensitive.",RainyDaysAndMondays3,993,396,0.9200000166893004,0.0931871495732259,1751150142,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lmzbls/aita_for_running_away_when_he_grabbed_the_umbrella/,2025,6,AmItheAsshole,2025-06-28 22:35:42

It was just me, my mom’s boyfriend (Sam) and his son so, I asked Sam where my food went and he said he gave it to his son.

Obviously, I was upset because 1. You didn’t even ask and 2. You gave all of it to him, knowing he wouldn’t finish it so now half of the food I paid for is sitting in the trash.

I told him to stop just feeding my food to his son without asking, which he does ALL the time. He’ll take my food from the fridge, and just give it to his son. He never, ever asks. 

Like I don’t mind sharing but I feel like taking my things without asking isn’t nice.

1ljon7k,AITA for yelling at my aunt when she decorated my books for school?,"I know, the title sounds bitchy. I (14F) go to summer school because I did very poorly in my classes last year. This summer, I have tried to take the initiative to change. I bought 10 compositions notebooks and started researching study methods so I can perform more efficiently. Now, back to the summer school thing, my mum works long hours at her place of work, so my aunt (her sister) is the one to pick me up. 


A few days ago, I had brought to my aunts one of my books so I could study and take notes while at her house. I had a few stickers on there, maybe 2-3. After studying, I left the book on her dining table and took a nap on the couch. While I was laying down, she started looking at the notebook and kept saying things like “Oh its so lovely, I have the perfect scrapbooking tape to put on it,” or, “I’m gonna go get my crafting stuff to add things on it.” I laughed and said No, that I liked my book the way it was. She kept pushing and pushing for her to decorate it and it got to the point where I firmly tell her no, that I was happy with what my books looked like at the moment, and I would be very upset if she did something to it, and went to sleep. 


If upset was the only word to explain how I was feeling, It would still be an understatement. 


I woke up and completely forgot about the book, and I only remembered when my mum picked me up and told me to collect my things. I asked my aunt where she put my book, and she had a cheeky grin and said “Your new and improved book is over here” and she pulled it out. 

I. was. furious. The book wasn’t ugly, but still. She didnt listen to what I told her to do, and did the exact OPPOSITE. I started yelling at her asking her “Why did you do that? I specifically told u not to. You waited until I fell asleep to do it?” She had a sad expression on her face, and that kinda made me feel bad, but it honestly was the last straw. I got in the car and my mum God bless her soul was so tired so all she told her sister was that when I tell her not to do something, she needs to listen and respect that. 

I still feel bad I yelled at her, especially seeing her expression after. AITA?

Update; I called her and apologized for yelling. I know the comments were on the fence about me apologizing, but I recognized that yelling at her was not the correct choice and there were multiple different approaches to the situation. I am a very neat person and I like all my belongings a certain way and color, so her doing that irritates me not only because it didn’t “match the vibe”, but because I clearly expressed I didn’t want her to. Anyways, I sat my mum down and told her how I felt, and she offered to drive me to my aunts place so I could apologize. I said no (it was my mum’s day off) and that I would call her. I called her, and she said she was surprised for me yelling at her because she thought she was just decorating and helping me because it looked “sad”. I asked her what she meant and she said the book looked depressing and needed a bit of pop. I told her respectfully that it didn’t matter how she took it, if I enjoyed it then that was all that mattered. She mumbled an “I guess” and kept going off about how “some people just don’t appreciate help”. She asked me if I used it still and I said no because I didn’t like how it looked now and I had an extra anyway and found similar stickers. She proceeded to tell me I was a “neat-freak” and “might have OCD.” I.  Had. It. I went off. Not in a bad tone, in a firm one. I said “Auntie, if you see a house on your street, and you don’t like the color, you don’t paint the house. It was my notebook. I liked it the way it was. You asked if you could decorate, I said no. If someone is your age and doesn’t understand boundaries, Lord help them. When someone says no, it means no. I don’t have OCD for not liking a book you decorated after I specifically told you I did not want you to decorate it.” The phone was quiet, then a simple “Just crazy.” and she hung up.

When we all got home, she got really snippy and said that it was super rude that we all got our own drinks and didn't order one for her. My brother and I brought up that she said no when the waitress asked, but she said that wasn't the issue. In her opinion, we should've known to order her a drink too because everyone else got one, and the fact that we ""let"" her go thirsty was inconsiderate. And that in the future we ought to order her drinks too. She also said that she was only saying ""no"" to the waitress because her family should've ""taken care of her"" (her words, not mine). 

The three of us have been kind of arguing back and forth about it, and I'm just tired of fighting, so I wanted to get some more opinions on whether or not I should've ordered her a drink as well.

1lvxapt,AITA for refusing to punish my daughter after she blew up on the classclown that she dint want at her birthday party?,"My daughter is 12 and she goes to a small school. Her grade only has 18 students (10 boys and 8 girls). My daughter also has other friends from the sports she does. We plan to have her go to a much larger high school in the future. Her 13th birthday party was last weekend and I asked who she wanted to invite, she wanted to invite 7 of the girls from her class and 5 from her soccer team. The one girl she doesn't want to invite is name Kelly.

My daughter doesn't like Kelly, she is the class clown in her grade and my daughter hides her annoying and attention seeking. I asked her why she didn't want her there and her response was ""she ruins school for me all the time, I don't want her to ruin my birthday."" I agreed with her list and sent the invites out.

My ex-wife is invited to all her major milestone instead of us doing separate events. I learned an hour beofre the party my ex-wife sent an invte to Kelly since her mom found out about the party. My daughter was not happy to see her (it was a suprise for her), I told her to enjoy the party.

It was going well until the cake came out, my daughter wanted a glitter cake (when you blow out the candles glitter goes everywhere). While everyone was around the cake, Kelly took her fingers and swiped icing off the top layer of the cake. It ruined the cake and my daughter lost it. She yelled at Kelly, basically saying, "" what is wrong with you, this is why I didn't want you her and that you ruin everything."" She ran to her room after and Kelly was crying.

Kelly's parent is wanting an apolgy, my ex-wife wants her to apoligze as well. I am refusing to make her do that or punish her at all. I pointed out that my ex never should have invited her and to the mom that her child ruined the cake, and that at 12 years old should know better.

1m7m35l,AITA for forcing my diet on my boyfriend?,"I’m from France originally, and I moved to the states almost 2 years ago. Now for some reason, the food here makes me sick. Not in an “Ew, that’s gross.” Kind of way. But actually physically sick. My body seems to struggle to digest it. Whether it’s take out or fancy restaurant food. Either I can’t go to the bathroom for days, or I’m violently vomiting. I tried dealing with it for months and months, but I started losing weight very quickly because I couldn’t eat. I ended up developing a serious aversion to food, and my family recommended I go and speak to a specialist.

I had never had a problem back home, and I was terrified I was seriously ill. So I went to multiple doctors where I was poked and prodded and I had multiple tests done. They have all said nothing is wrong with me physically.

I spoke to a dietitian and he explained that my body is probably not used to the amount of salt and preservatives that is found in the food in the states. (Please don’t think I’m bashing the US! I love it here and it’s a great country.) My dietician recommended fresh and organic produce to see how my body coped, and to my delight, I improved.

I stopped vomiting and I was able to start slowly putting weight back on. I started making meals from scratch and meal prepping to save time throughout the week. My dad is actually a chef back home, so he was more than happy to send me some recipes to keep my diet interesting. I made a delicious vegetarian lasagna from scratch, and put it in the oven to cook. My boyfriend (American) came home after work and asked what was for dinner. I said I was making a veggie lasagna. He rolled his eyes and said he was sick of “that organic crap” and wanted a cheeseburger.

The comment hurt. I made a real effort at meal times to keep it varied so we’re not always eating the same thing. I said I couldn’t make one because I didn’t even have any burger buns. He said it was unfair to “make” him eat my diet. I had never realized he was opposed to it. He benefited from home cooked meals and I had seen that his clothes were fitting him better. He had more energy and he didn’t sleep so much on the weekends. I apologized and said I didn’t mean to make him feel forced.

1m52myo,AITA for telling my roommate's friend about my heritage?,"I 21F am half Mexican and half Chinese. My parents came to the US before I was born, but thought it was very important for me to learn their native languages and participate in both of their cultures. Because of this, I can speak Spanish and Mandarin. Both of my parents also loved cooking, so growing up we ate a lot of traditional Mexican and Chinese dishes as well as some blended fusion meals as well.

A few nights ago, I was cooking dinner at my apartment. I was making one of those fusion dishes, but I got stuck on a particular step, so I called my mom to ask for help and we talked in Spanish. I was on the phone when my roommate, Ann 23F, came home with her friends, who I was not told were coming over.

Later, one of the guys from the group came into the kitchen and asked what I was making because it smelled  good. I explained the dish was created by my parents to blend Mexican and Chinese cuisine. He then asked why I was speaking on the phone in Spanish earlier, so I told him that I’m half Mexican and half Chinese, and that I grew up speaking both Spanish and Mandarin with my parents. He seemed genuinely interested and asked me more about the languages and the cooking, so we ended up talking for a while about my background and how food and language are such a big part of my life.

The next day, I found out through my other roommate that Ann had told her I was showing off and flirting with her friend. This pissed me off because I wasn't trying to flirt with him and he was the one who started the conversation with me. I tried to talk to Ann about this, but she just seemed annoyed and told me that it was obvious how it looked and I should be more mindful when she has her friends over. I told her that I can't be ""mindful"" if she doesn't even warn me about having company over. She said that she doesn't have to get my permission to invite people to the apartment. I was getting irritated by this point so I let the conversation die down after this.

It's been so awkward ever since this happened and every time I see her she's short with me and barely acknowledges me. I'm starting to wonder if I behaved out of line. AITA?

Met him once at a restaurant and spoke for a few minutes.  I have 2 German Shepards, Jameson & Guinness. My house is their house. I chose this property, because it was a good fit for them.   

This friend (32F) dislikes my dogs on a bad day to being tolerant of them on a good day. When they arrived both dogs wanted to say hi, neither my friend or the spouse acknowledged them.    I found that annoying.   Literally everyone else that showed up said hi to my dogs. Like all 20 other people. They sat on the couch when Guinness came up to them.  I see him say something to my friend.  My dogs are the sweetest things ever.  He gently pushed Guinness away and he asked me if I could put the dogs in another room, citing they don't want the dog bothering them during the party.  

I backed up my dogs, told them i'm sorry, but this is Jameson and Guinness's house, you need to deal with it or leave. My dogs live here and they don't get put away for anyone.  If you just pet them, they'll leave you alone.  After a brief convo, they decided to leave. I told them they don't call the shots at my house about my dogs.

1ltfwg9,"AITA for telling my family if they don’t like the way something is, they can take care of it themselves?","I am married and have 3 kids, all are teens. My husband and I both work and my kids are in school and do sports or clubs after school. I recently hit a ceiling in my field and in order to continue to grow professionally, I had to get a graduate degree, so I started my masters degree. 

In the past, I usually did most of the chores. My husband does the typical “man” chores” my kids have some of their own chores like doing their own laundry, taking turns sweeping/vacuuming, cleaning their own bathroom, etc. I did a majority of the rest and all of the cooking. 

I am a year into my degree. At the start I was keeping up with the chores I did before, but it quickly wasn’t possible. I asked for help and was told “everything is fine, you’re being too picky”. But over time, my family seems to be getting fed up. 

They’ve been complaining about things a lot lately. From eating frozen meals (I make them myself in a large batch and freeze them for later), to the floors having stains (if you cleaned up skills, they wouldn’t be there!), the stairs have dust and pet fur on them, etc. If they bring it up, I tell them they are capable of handling it, but they just walk away and it doesn’t get done. I’m doing what I can, but between work, school, and everything else at home, it can’t all be done. We aren’t living in squalor, i just can’t get to the finer details like I could before. 

Yesterday my husband came to me while I was doing my homework and said the shower curtain liner in our bathroom was moldy. This pushed me over the edge. 

I had my family come into the living room and told them that if they don’t like how something is, they have able bodies and can deal with it themself. That they have the skills to clean, I have just been taking care of so much they didn’t see. Now I need them to step up. That they don’t like something, they need to step up and take care of it. And how I also plan to redistribute chores. 

My kids were arguing that they shouldn’t have to do more, they’re in school and busy afterwards. I told them that I don’t care, I am busy too! And I can’t do it all. That need to step up or shut up, in nicer terms. That night my husband told me I was too harsh and need to lighten up. He says I was rude and basically telling them their feelings don’t matter and I need to lay off of them. I told him the message wasn’t only for the kids, it was for him too. He needs to step up. 

But afterwards I started to doubt myself and felt too harsh. No one is really talking to me right now. I’m worrying now I was too harsh. I did change up the status quo in the house for my own personal reasons.

1lu69qb,"AITA for pulling my daughter from soccer camp and telling her that she can't see her ""ghetto"" friends anymore","Throwaway account

My daughter is in soccer camp twice a week since the beginning of the summer, she is 15. She has made two new friends and I do not like them. They have been over my home once and they were rude, loud, and obnoxious. They made a mess of the house, gave me attitude when I asked them to quiet down (one rolled her eyes and started arguing with me), they were blasting music, and money went missing ( I had 40 dollars on the counter and it disappeared). So I am not the biggest fan of them, and after that I didn't allow them to hangout at our home. My daughter was not a fan of this but still saw them at soccer camp.

The soccer camp is next to a plaza and they allow the kids to get food from the fast-food places. I got a call from the coach that my daughter and her two friends caused issues at Arby's. She recorded it on her phone, her two friends were heckling the fast food worker and left after causing a mess (dumped there drink all over the ground and flipped off the worker). My daughter was recording this and laughing along. TBH I found it disgusting.

I informed her that she is being pulled out of soccer camp because she can't behave by herself and that she won't be seeing those friend anymore. She was very unhappy and started an argument. She told me that I don't like them because they are ghetto and I told her she is correct. They are too ghetto, too loud, too rude, too disrespectful and I am not allowing her near them. She hasn't talked to me since. I shared this with my sister and she basically told me I forgot my roots and to let her see the friends.

She got over it after like a day (or a week) but she still was. We have two daughters, she was hoping for a boy and a girl.

1lte1fp,AITA for drinking fruit juice when my partner has said he doesn't like it?,"Let me give you some background. I (26F) have been drinking diluted summer fruits juice all my life because I hate drinking water. When I do try drinking water I physically wretch due to the anxiety it gives me trying to drink it. So I stay hydrated by drinking diluted cordial.

When I met my current partner (34M, let's call him Jim) I was drinking 30% cordial 70% water, which I admit now was strong.
About 6 months into my relationship with Jim, he confessed he didn't like me drinking the juice because it made my breath smell bad (of the juice), it stopped me trying new foods and it stopped us from travelling cheap because we would have to pay for baggage just so I can take the juice on holiday. He even compared it to an addiction and how he was able to quit smoking so I can quit this. 

We decided to compromise and 1 year later I had reduced it down to 5% cordial. I was able to take my juice in mini aeroplane bottles and I had to admit I was tasting food better.

However Jim was still not happy and we keep getting into fights about how 'disgusting' it is and it is putting him off wanting to kiss me. I can't even have other fruit flavoured drinks because Jim says it smells and tastes too similar.

So I tried to give it up for him. It has been a month of attempting to drink sugar water. I am getting panic attacks and dehydrated because I'm not drinking enough. I am considering going back to the cordial because of this but I am worried I'd be letting myself and Jim down.

1lwqser,"AITA for ""embarrassing"" my more fit coworker?","I am a camp counselor (25M) who works with elementary aged boys. To give some context, I am incredibly short and fat. Like, I am under 5 feet tall and around 200 pounds. This does not affect my ability to do my job. I'm just as active as any other counselor, I work with the kids just as much.I have to get blood tests done regularly for unrelated reasons (related to why I'm so short) and there's never really any concern when it comes to my cholesterol or insulin or anything weight related. I'm just saying this so you have some context for my general appearance and the fact that no, my weight doesn't affect my health or my level of activity.

My co-counselor is a guy around my age who is (I think) a baseball player. We could not look more different. He's got more than a foot of height on me and probably about the same weight, so he's obviously more visibly fit. He brags a lot about how even after we spend all day chasing kids in the sun, he still goes to the gym for a couple of hours. 

The issue is when it comes to actually having to use strength practically, I out do him every time. I'm not trying to do it intentionally. But when we have to carry 20 kids backpacks and he can only handle 8 while I have 12, or when he can't open a jar, or when we have to lug heavy equipment and he's huffing and puffing while I'm not having a problem, it becomes pretty evident that I am just stronger than him, at least for stuff like that. I'm sure he could out bench me or whatever proper fitness stuff is, and trust me he crushes me when we play sports with the kids, I'm just talking about that kind of work.

The issue is that the kids have started to pick up on the fact that I am the ""strong counselor"". If they want to be picked up or can't open something in their lunch or want a break from carrying their bag on a hike, they come to me. Apparently, my co-counselor complained to one of the other counselors that I am ""embarrassing"" him because a guy like me shouldn't be able to be stronger than him. That counselor then came to me and told me I should tone it done because it can be hard for someone who prides themself on being an athlete to be worse at something than a guy ""like me"". I said there was no way I was going to do my job worse just to protect hit ego, and the other counselor said I was being a jerk and as the summer goes on the boys might start bullying my co-counselor if they think he's weaker than me, which I don't think is going to happen but I'm not sure.

He immediately got an attitude with me and said I wasn’t going to eat it all (the dish only had two large stuffed shells??) and told me I was being stingy. His mom I guess kinda read the room and said she would just have some of his. He then doubles down and basically tells her to take the other shell from my plate and puts it on her plate for her.

1mbtusi,AITA for not allowing Airbnb guests to use my patio,"I bought a flat as an immigrant a few years ago in a bad reputation street of a bad reputation city in a bad reputation country in Europe. 

I won't say that it was just luck, but the country became an attractive country to visit, the city developed a lot, and my street, being in the center, became very attractive to visitors. 

Now my street has been fully renovated and so has the façade of my building, because we got public funds for that. But the inside is still prewar grey because we are fine with it. 

My flat is the only one that opens to the courtyard and after speaking to the neighbours they were all enthusiastic for me to turn my corner of the courtyard into something pretty, on whichever way I felt. In this kind of buildings it is defined how much each apartment owns of the land, but not delimited. So I own, let's say, 5% of the land. Usually I would use it for a parking space but it is not like you have a delimited parking space and since I don't drive I asked the neighbours if I could take the corner next to my door as mine. This was a no parking space and everyone enthusiastically agreed to let me make a mini garden/patio. 

After the city and the street blew up with tourism someone did some legal trickery to buy the flats on top of mine that were supposed to be saved for low income people and turn them into Airbnb. We are not happy about it for many reasons, starting with those flats were supposed to be for actual low income people. 

But to the actual conflict: I let my neighbours use my patio, but I've been kicking Airbnb guests out of it. Apparently the Airbnb host posts pictures of my little corner of the courtyard as a public space. I don't think it's a public space since I own part of the land and the Airbnb owner does not, and it has been accepted that this is my portion of the land. 

Now the Airbnb owner is saying that he will sue me for discrimination since I share my little patio with the other neighbours but I don't allow tourists in it and he has had some negative reviews. 

I'm absolutely safe legally, but morally am I the asshole for not allowing tourists in my space when I let neighbours use it?",DisneyWitchyGirl,7453,357,0.9399999976158142,0.2305513352302312,1753740221,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mbtusi/aita_for_not_allowing_airbnb_guests_to_use_my/,2025,7,AmItheAsshole,2025-07-28 22:03:41
1m8i37v,AITA for expecting my bf to grab a bag for me,"I (20f) was at my bfs house (20m) yesterday. Im on my period and keep a few tampons in my purse, but had a ton in the bag I brought over, along with my change of clothes. When I went over I went to talk to his mom in the kitchen, and we talked for a few minutes and I left my bag there. I went to his room and he was playing games at his desk and I was on his bed.

I started bleeding and went to the bathroom and realized I bled trough my underwear and a little trough my pants. I checked my purse and saw I had no tampons as I forgot to refill it since I had filled the duffel bag, I realized I couldn't just go to the kitchen as I now didn't have pants and I couldn't even leave the bathroom because someone might be there. I called my bf and he told me to let him finish his game. I asked him how long that would take

He said that it would be like 20ish minutes till he could help me since him and his friends just got into a new game. I asked if he expected for me to just wait cramping, in the bathroom him and his sister SHARE, for 20 minutes. He told me that me not having tampons in my purse wasn't his problem and that he wasn't going to sell his game for me. I said that he was being really mean. When he finally came I told him I was upset that he made me wait and he told me that he didn't know what I expected him to do and that I needed to manage myself better. I said even if I did, I still would have bled trough, which is why I couldn't leave. He told me that I could have figured it out. I told him that I literally couldn't and he just said whatever and I went home a little after that and I'm starting to think that I could have planned a little better for it.",DiscussionMental7742,3671,1135,0.949999988079071,0.2193094859544763,1753395535,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1m8i37v/aita_for_expecting_my_bf_to_grab_a_bag_for_me/,2025,7,AmItheAsshole,2025-07-24 22:18:55
1ltdxi1,AITA for telling my friend i don't want to end up like her after she told me to lower my standards?,"I (22F) met Rachel (23F) 3 years ago in university, and we became friends. For context, I have never dated before and I am ok with that, I don't purposefully seek out relationship and I am comfortable being by myself. I have a few close friends and this is enough for me. In contract, Rachel has had a lot of boyfriends, and doesn't like to be single (her words). She met her husband, Max, 2 years ago in one of the uni classes, and they quickly began dating. He isn't the most pleasant guy to be around imo, and they had quite a few big arguments during the relationship. He even tried to flirt with me, and I told Rachel about it, but she dismissed it saying he was probably just trying to butter me up so I help him with homework. He has told some sexist jokes in the past too. Whenever they fought, I always told Rachel she deserves better and to break up with him, but in the end they always made up. He proposed to her after one year, and they got married 4 months ago. However, after they moved in together (in the flat that Rachel's parents pay the rent for) Max became even worse. He never helps out with cleaning or cooking, doesn't really take Rachel out on dates anymore, and whenever she tries to talk to him about it, Max tells her to stop complaining about ""wife's duties"".

So, a few days ago Rachel asked me if I would like to go on a date with one of her friends from high school who is single and is looking for a relationship. I've never been on a date before, so I agreed out of curiosity. We went to a nice restaurant. The guy never asked me a single question about myself back, and after I got tired of coming up with questions about him, we just sat the rest of the meal in awkward silence. We split the bill, and after he walked me to the subway station, he tried to kiss me. I declined as politely as I could and went home.

The next day I met up with Rachel. Apparently she's already heard about how the date went from her friend. She asked me why I rejected him. I told her the reasons I mentioned before, and that I didn't really like the guy. Then she rolled her eyes and said that I need to lower my standards because I'm honestly not that attractive, that I blew maybe my only chance to date, and if I continue like that I'll end up forever alone. Even though she knows I'm fine without a relationship! Also I'm not insecure about my appearance, but hearing my friend say that about me hurt. I got angry and said ""Better to be forever alone than end up like you, with a husband that doesn't respect me"". She started crying and said that I'm being rude when she's just trying to look out for me, and then left. We haven't texted or spoken since.

Honestly I'm not sure if I want to salvage this friendship after finding out this is how Rachel felt about me all this time. However, I feel guilty for saying this to her when I knew it was a sore spot, and also for kinda blaming her for the fact that her husband is awful. So, AITA in this situation?

1lpecq5,AITAH for not taking my son’s friend who is our neighbor to events and activities because he’s not potty trained?,"TL;DR:
One of the kids in our neighborhood friend group is 9 and still needs an adult to wipe him after he poops. I don’t think that’s my responsibility, so I don’t include him in activities that take us far from his mom. Other parents apparently have been wiping him, and now I’m being talked about for “excluding” him. AITA for setting this boundary?


I live in a close-knit neighborhood where the kids all play together, go to the same school, and bounce between our homes for meals, sleepovers, and activities. It’s a great dynamic most of the time.

One of the boys (M9) in the group still requires his mother to wipe him after using the bathroom. Again—he’s 9. I’m not here to judge his development, but I am saying this: that is not my responsibility, and I didn’t think it needed to be said out loud.

The kid avoids using the restroom away from home entirely. He’s held it through school days, playdates, even had accidents trying to get back home. If he’s at my place and has to go, he just leaves.

I’m pretty active—I take the kids hiking, camping, geocaching, to hot springs, beaches, golf courses—all-day stuff, far from home. I don’t invite this boy on those kinds of outings because, frankly, I don’t want to be out in the middle of nowhere and have to wipe a 9-year-old kid’s butt. I don’t think that’s a normal expectation to place on anyone outside of his parents.

Recently, another parent vented that they had been wiping this kid, which shocked me. Then I hear that people are saying I’ve been excluding him—and yeah, I have, from situations where it’s absolutely unreasonable to expect me to step in for that kind of care.

So, AITA for not including him in certain activities because I refuse to take on what I consider to be an inappropriate responsibility?",GoDavyGo,4893,712,0.959999978542328,0.2040200217927738,1751406133,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lpecq5/aitah_for_not_taking_my_sons_friend_who_is_our/,2025,7,AmItheAsshole,2025-07-01 21:42:13
1lsnj7d,AITA for telling off my 'future' sister in law when she didn't want to invite my younger  brother to her wedding,"I 23f have an older brother, Drew, 26m who is getting married at the end of this summer. To say it lightly me and his fiance, Lacy, 25f, do not get along. She's very stuck up and has made some snide comments to me and my younger brother, Max, 16m. For context Max has always been the black sheep of the family. He is very academically and artistically talented but my father and mother are disappointed in his lack of sports (cliche I know), not to mention they've favored my sister, his twin, Caroline, 16f. Max and Lacy were civil for awhile but I guess I haven't seen them speak in a long time for reasons unknown to me. 

The problem occurred last night when I was asking Lacy about the wedding and how the planning was going. She started telling me her seating chart and showing me what she had planned, I was looking at the chart and Max's name  was nowhere to be found. I don't love Lacy but I'm not going to assume the worst of her, so I asked her where Max's name was and she got suddenly quiet. "" He's not going to be there"", she said. ""You mean not in the wedding party?"", I ask. ""No, he's not invited"", she said it so calmly I'd assume she was talking about the weather. I kept asking her why she wouldn't invite him but invited Caroline. She just said that she feels Caroline is more mature because she is a girl.  


This wedding isn't going to be child free, Lacy has stated this multiple times. I have many little cousins who are being invited, since family is very important to us. Not inviting Max makes no sense. He is a very nice kid, and very mature for his age. Much more mature than Caroline. He never causes problems but like I mentioned earlier, there are some big issues with him not following Drew's and my dad's footsteps in football. I know Lacy is very desperate for my family's approval so maybe outlining Max is the way to do it for her but I have a feeling there's something more to it. 

After what Lacy said about not inviting Max, I stood up and started yelling at her for not including Max.She kind of just ignored what I was saying but when I escalated, Drew came over. As he was walking over she started to cry and make a bigger scene about it. Drew knelt down to comfort her and gave me dirty looks. Once she was inside he turned to me and started yelling at me about being rude to her, when she is under so much stress from planning the wedding and trying to get my family to like her. I understand that my family is closed knit and kind of not welcoming to newcomers but that doesn't excuse her behavior and I told my brother so. I asked him why he didn't want to invite Max and he just told me to stay out of it (Classic move of him). He walked out then and we haven't spoken since last night. 

I don't want to fight with Drew, but I'm standing my ground for Max's sake, Max also doesn't know about any of this yet and I'm hesitant to tell him. My parents have stayed out of it so far but Drew is still set on being mad at me AITA?""",Accurate-Damage-7458,4189,855,0.959999978542328,0.2017266669370541,1751759334,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lsnj7d/aita_for_telling_off_my_future_sister_in_law_when/,2025,7,AmItheAsshole,2025-07-05 23:48:54
1ma53vh,AITA: Did I cross a line by calling the hotel to check on my adult daughter when she wasn’t responding?,"Throwaway account.

I’m (57F) a mom. My daughter (31F) is married, and they live on the East Coast while my husband and I are on the West Coast. We’re close, and she and I mostly communicate by text. We both have iPhones and share our locations through Find My.

Recently, she flew out to a city about an hour from where I live for a job interview. She had been traveling all day and landed around 9 PM local time; which, for her, was midnight. We exchanged a few light texts after she landed. She mentioned she was going to get a burger at In-N-Out.

After that, I sent a few more texts. One wishing her good luck on the interview and another with a picture of our family dog, which she absolutely adores and usually replies to right away.

But I didn’t hear back.

I also texted a reminder to be careful since I know the area where her hotel is located can be a little sketchy. Still no response.


At that point, I started to feel uneasy. I don’t usually check her location, but I opened Find My and saw her phone was showing up at what looked like a residential address: not a hotel. I called her twice. No answer.

Eventually, I noticed there was a hotel next to that location, but she hadn’t told me the name, so I wasn’t sure. I waited about 20 minutes to give her time to settle in, and then I called the front desk. I knew they couldn’t confirm if she was staying there, but they offered to call the room.

My daughter was in bed, asleep, and got startled when the hotel phone rang. She figured it was probably me and told the receptionist she’d call me back.

She did, but was very upset. She told me to never do that again. She said I crossed a line, that I was being “weird” and overbearing, and that she’s 31 and can take care of herself. She added that if anyone should be calling to check in, it should be her husband, not her mom.

Did I cross a line? I really wasn’t trying to overstep, I was just worried when I didn’t hear back and saw what looked like an odd location. But I do understand she’s an adult and wants boundaries. It’s just hard to turn off the mom instinct.",Throwaway_concerned8,1764,1373,0.8100000023841858,0.1966298244003381,1753565995,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ma53vh/aita_did_i_cross_a_line_by_calling_the_hotel_to/,2025,7,AmItheAsshole,2025-07-26 21:39:55
1lv3g4z,AITA if I return mail to sender?,"So my spouse has this friend who keeps having mail sent to our house. Idk why, he has a house, but yet he has all his mail sent here. For the first *three months* I didn't have an issue with it but a few weeks ago he had something important sent to the house that he needed asap. He wanted my husband to bring it to him but when my husband when out for drinks he forgot the letter. The next morning (a saturday) this dude calls us over a dozen times at 6am... like my husband didn't answer the first time so his ""friend"" just started calling again and again and again in a super passive aggressive fashion. Eventually my spouse answered the call, grabbed the letter and went to bring it to his ""friend"" like some servant. It was not a pleasant way to be woken up and I told my spouse to tell his friend that we aren't the post office and that he can send his mail elsewhere. Hubby, who is incredibly too kind, thinks I'm over reacting. I dropped the issue but today I found not one but *four* peices of mail including a new bank card and something thick and important looking from the social security office.

1meghvb,"AITA for telling my roommate no, she can’t have the larger bedroom, put her desk in the living room, and use extra common storage for only $50/month more than me?","I’m moving into a new apartment in a few weeks with a roommate. The apartment has two bedrooms and the rent is $2,600. One room is a little bigger and has more closet space, and my roommate and I are trying to figure out who gets which room and how to split rent in a way that feels fair.

She’s saying she wants the bigger room, but she also wants to put her desk in the living room to work there. I already told her I’m not comfortable with that because I would feel like I’m disturbing her if I needed to cook or j relax in the shared space while she needs quiet or is in a meeting. I also told her I think the bigger room should cost $100 more because it has more space and a larger closet.

She came back and said she thinks the rent should only be a $50 difference and she still wants to have her desk in the living room, and maybe use more of the shared hallway storage than me too. To me that just feels really unbalanced and is way more than I would try and ask for personally - she’s getting the bigger room, an extra separate work space outside of her room and taking over more of the shared space, all for barely more rent.

My two biggest priorities are (1) having a decent-sized room where I can study privately since I’m starting an intense dental hygiene program, or (2) feeling like I can use the shared spaces without walking on eggshells or constantly worrying about being too loud.

I suggested two options that I think are fair:

Option 1:
She takes the smaller room, we split rent evenly, and she can use the hallway storage to make up for the closet size difference and put her desk in the living room.

Option 2:
She takes the larger room, pays $100 more (or $50 more if I get the single parking lot spot), and the shared spaces stay neutral, no desk, we split the hallway storage equally, and everyone can use the space whenever.

I’m not being stubborn about the money and I honestly would be happy to pay $1400 and $1200 if the common spaces were shared evenly and I had the larger room. I just don’t want to end up in a situation where I feel resentful or like I don’t have space to breathe. I’ve tried to compromise, but it feels like she’s pushing for everything she wants without really taking my needs into account.

She brought no money, ate our food, drank my alcohol, then disappeared to make out with two random guys. We stopped our day to look for her, made eye contact, and got ignored.

When she finally showed back up, he told her she could ride with the guys she was with since she clearly wasn’t with us. She started crying, and he still told her she could ride back with us, but it’s not fair for her to disappear and treat us like a free ride. She chose to leave and turned her location off.

1mefijb,AITA for telling my dad if he wants me to not move he has to help me buy a home?,"I am a baby millennial who is trying to buy a home in this economy. I make a decent salary but apparently not enough to afford a home with the going prices nowadays. I’m not even wanting anything crazy big or extravagant. I’d be content with a 900 square feet condo. The average cost of a home in my town is $650k. I was aiming for $250k max. All housing is expensive where I live in the Midwest. 

I told my parents I may be moving soon as I was searching for a home in low cost of living states such as Alabama or Tennessee and they are opposed to me moving. They said they’re getting up in age and need their children around in case of an emergency (yes I have siblings but I’m the only female child). I help my parents the most. One of my parents is also terminally ill and I’m a part-time caregiver. 

I told them I needed somewhere to live. Moving home isn’t an option since I left years ago due to emotional abus3 that has since been resolved. I told myself I’d never move back with my parents though because of that. 

My parents told me to just keep renting. I don’t want to keep renting forever. I’ve been renting for 7 years. They told me I should not move far from them because they need my help and I help them the most. I told him I didn’t really have any other options. My dad said I can move back home and I declined. I told him if he wants me to live near him then he should help chip in to make that possible for a down payment and he said no.

So I told him I will move to a cheaper place then so my money will work in my favor to afford a home. I have saved up, I just cannot specifically afford a half a million dollar home.

1mbu5xt,AITA for yelling at my partner who keeps buying crappy branded food when I’ve asked him not too,"My partner (M37) and I (F38) have two young kids and we are well and truely in the trenches with our newborn at the moment. Both of us are like ships in the night, barely have time to think or do anything and our routine has been shot to bits managing our newborn. 
He has taken on the responsibility of going to the supermarket more these days as he finds the walks enjoyable and takes our toddler out whilst I’m home with the new born. 
I sometimes buy myself a coconut water as a treat as I love this one brand. Recently he’s been buying some coconut water for me because he knows I love it. 
But when he’s at the shops he grabs the cheapest brand coconut water but I cannot stand the taste of it and have asked him calmly several times to not buy that brand and to please spend the extra dollar to buy the other brand one that I really enjoy. (So back note, my husband is the stingiest cheap scape known to man and he’s actually admitted to me his money saving isn’t normal compared to others. We both have seriously well paying jobs and are not financially stressed at all, he just loves a bargain and buys the no name brand everything alllll the time) 


He says he just grabs the one mindlessly and doesn’t mean to upset me but he’s done it 5 or 6 times now, and the last time I didn’t get angry at him I just got him to really focus and explained my frustrations and for him to please stop buying that brand, it tastes gross, its not a treat for me and to please get the other brand that I would occasionally but and he was like yep ofcourse and said he would (like he has every other time, but I thought sortof explaining it more it would sink in) Then today he brought home the shit wee tasting stuff AGAIN and I just lost it. We’ve had a huge weekend, I’m sick and a coconut water would have been the nicest treat for me but bringing home the brand I cannot stand felt like it was the biggest punch in the gut to me. When I saw it, I was literally shook, I just lost it and yelled at him and was like WTF did you buy this shit again and threw the carton in the bin without even opening it. He was like woah woah woah I didn’t do it on purpose. I then yelled what is wrong with you?! Like why do you keep doing this and he just walked out of the room so it ended there. 

He got really upset with me and said I’d made him cry by yelling at him and made our toddler upset (cos he got a bit scared when I yelled). The whole thing felt like a complete set up to me and I don’t know after asking 5-6 times previously patiently and calmly how to not get to a point of just cracking up and yelling for him to stop buying that stuff because it feels like a constant reminder of how much he doesn’t care about me after asking him to stop buying it several times.

1m5usmr,AITA for telling my mom she’s not my kids mom?,"
Throwaway because I just want a verdict and to be done with it. So for background I 28f and my husband 30m have two kids. 7m and 4f. My mother is actually a great grandmother. She lives the kids and is very helpful but she has this habit overstepping. 

So both our kids do chores. We give them things to do that they’re capable of doing. Like my son does the dishes sometimes after dinner. My daughter will help set and clean up the table afterwards. Those kinds of things. My mom came to visit us recently and I’ve been noticing she’s being doing this thing. She stops my son from whatever chore he’s doing and does it for him but if she sees my daughter doing something she won’t. At first I thought she just didn’t want her grandkids to do work because she often calls me a cold mother for making them do chores but then I figured out the pattern and it rubbed me the wrong way because I remembered she used to do the same thing to me. My brothers would do nothing while I did everything so I started correcting her and making my son finish his chores himself which made her really agitated. Yesterday we were having dinner and my daughter and husband were clearing up the table because it was my son’s turn to do the dishes. She tried stopping him but I told him to the dishes and took her outside. She told me I’m so cold for making my son wash dishes and why couldn’t I do it, I explained to her that we like to split chores evenly in the house and if he’s capable he should(it was like 5 plates and cups and a few spoons). She kept going and she called me lazy (something she would often do whenever I asked my brothers to help me out with chores). 

Here’s where I may be an asshole. I told her ‘she’s one to talk after making me clean up after everybody my whole life’ . I told her I’m not going to enable my son to be ‘f*cking’ losers like her sons. My little brother literally had to be spoon fed until he was ten because he refused to eat if my mom didn’t feed him. I was apparently ill treating my son by making him do all these chores. I told her ‘I’m teaching him to be independent and that she may have raised two boys but she’s not my kids mom so she should f*ck off when I’m trying not turn my son into an incompetent asshole.’ She left crying. My dad called and told me she’s moping around.  My husband says it was deserved but he really doesn’t like my mother because he’s seen over the years how she treats me compared to how she treats my brothers. Did I go too far and any advice is appreciated.Thank you.

1ma3zye,AITA for going back on my promise to help my sister pay for her wedding when she wouldn’t move the date?,"Hi Reddit. So I (28M) have an older sister “Tina”(30F). When I was 15, I met a girl in the same grade called “May”(15F). May and I clicked instantly and we started dating a few weeks after. May and I dated through the rest of high school and college and I asked her to marry me when we were 22. We got married at 23 and had our son at 24. May unexpectedly passed away in a car accident when our son was 2, so 2 years ago. I’m still devastated and genuinely don’t think I’ll ever date or get married again. My whole family really liked May and we all took her loss hard. Except for Tina. 

Tina didn’t have a lot of luck with boyfriends during high school or college. Until she met Daniel (32M) she had never even been on a date. I know she felt really jealous that I got married and “started a life” first but other than that we were warm with each other. She was polite and respectful at May’s funeral and I thought she had gotten past the jealousy thing. 

Apparently not. Tina and Daniel started dating about 6 months after May died (1.5 years ago) and I was really happy for her. They got engaged 4 months ago and are planning their wedding for summer 2026. When they first got engaged Tina asked me if I would be willing to help cover some costs. Despite raising my son alone, I work a good job and make a lot more than Tina or Daniel, and I really wanted my sister to be happy so I said yes. Well, they just revealed their wedding date. 

Yes, you guessed it. Tina and Daniel are planning to get married on the same day that May and I were married. She “gave me a heads up” by texting me last week and letting me know. I asked her if she was mental and why would she do this. She said that it was the date they liked, and they had every right to pick it. Her and I went back and forth for a few days where I kind of begged her to reconsider. She did not. She posted it to Facebook yesterday. 

I sent her a text saying that she was in her right to pick the date, but that I would not be in attendance or contributing financially. She freaked out, repeatedly calling and texting. She called our mother who started to call and text me and word spreads fast in family so now everyone knows and it seems like the family is split in three sides. Half of the family says that I am in the right. Tina says I’m being an AH, both for not coming and not paying, and there are some cousins supporting her. Mom says that I don’t have go, but I should keep good on my promise. I don’t know. I feel like I’m in the right, but I need some objective opinions.",aitathrowawawa,3582,655,0.9300000071525574,0.1641046609757467,1753563126,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ma3zye/aita_for_going_back_on_my_promise_to_help_my/,2025,7,AmItheAsshole,2025-07-26 20:52:06
1m3dqqs,AITA for refusing to help pay for the damages my son caused at a party?,"I (47M) have been married to my wife, “Marie” (46M) for over 20 years. We have two children, “Alice” (18F) and “Eric” (17M).

We are fairly relaxed parents (our kids are allowed to drink, go out, try new things as long as we know and it’s safely done - preferably in our house). It’s legally allowed in our country.

Recently, Eric went to party and happened to get in a fight. It was at one of his friends houses, which means he caused quite a bit of damage.

After we seeked medical attention for him I received a call from the parent of the boy who threw the party. He insisted Eric did quite a lot in damages and I should be reliable for the compensation (or atleast part of it).

The issue is, Alice recently got into the college of her choice, and I had been saving up to pay for her tuition. If I paid for the damages Eric caused, it would seriously delay my ability to pay for Alice’s education and would force her into financial aid.

I explained to both my wife and Eric that I would tamper with Alice’s education because Eric made a dumb mistake. 

Eric has savings that he worked for months on end (overtime, extra work all the time) to save and it would cover all of the expenses.

He wanted to put that towards his start-up or invest it in the stock market.

My wife thinks it’s cruel to make Eric utilise his savings when Alice can easily take financial aid. I think it would be unfair to Alice to make her take out a loan when I promised her tuition.

Eric and my wife are extremely upset at me, we have not told Alice anything, but I feel like I shouldn’t budge on this.

The parent of the boy is an old time friend of mine and assured me that lawyers will be brought into this mess, but he does expect the money. 

I want to clarify that Eric has been punished in ways we see fit and he is definitely remorseful. He is otherwise a good kid and I am sure he has learnt his lesson.

1lye9uj,"AITA for throwing out my friend’s couch after it sat in my garage for 3.5 years, even though I said she could only store it for two weeks?","In 2019, a friend asked if she could store a couch in my garage. It had belonged to her late father, and they were clearing out his house.

I said no.

My garage is small. One car and barely any extra room. It isn’t insulated, it leaks, and squirrels basically have squatter rights. I don’t store anything there on purpose. I also told her that people always say they’ll “pick it up soon,” and then never do. Somehow the person doing the favor becomes the villain.

She kept pushing. I offered options:  
– Rent a storage unit  
– Get a U-Haul, take the couch home, and have her kids drive up and get her car  
– Leave it at her dad’s and take the risk

Her niece even borrowed a trailer to bring it to me. All that, just to keep it out of her siblings’ hands.

I finally said yes, but I was crystal clear. Two weeks. After that, I could do whatever I wanted with it.  
She said absolutely. Her kids would be there that weekend to pick it up.

They never came.

I called a few times that first year.  
“Oh yeah, we’ll come get it.”  
Crickets.  
In one of my “please get your couch” calls, she said, “I’m a Sagittarius. We’re not good at this stuff.”  
I’m still not sure what that has to do with picking up your couch.

I tried again in year two. Same story. After that, I gave up. She never once brought it up on her own.

Around year three and a half, I had construction work happening. The crew backed a trailer into the garage and accidentally crushed the couch. When we looked closer, it was already moldy and torn apart by squirrels. The workers felt bad. I told them not to worry. It had been sitting there for years.

We even discussed whether I should tell her. Everyone agreed there wasn’t much point. She hadn’t mentioned it in over three years.

So I didn’t.

Fast forward to this year — now year six. I mention I’m cleaning out the garage and she casually says, “Oh, I need to come get that couch.”

Me: “It’s gone. The squirrels got it.”  
Her: “What?”  
Me: “Yeah. The garage isn’t insulated. They love it in there.”  
Her: “I had no idea.”  
Me: “You did. You just forgot. And I said two weeks.”

She hasn’t spoken to me since. Unfriended. Full stop.

Meanwhile, I lived around that couch. I broke my toe on it. I had to work around it constantly. I paid to have it hauled away. It took up space I didn’t have for three and a half years. The first time she brought it up was in year six.

So I’m really asking:  
Should I have told her back when it got ruined, even though she hadn’t asked about it in years?  
At year six, should I have just said “sure, come get it” and played along, even though I doubt she would have?  
Or was this always going to end the same way, no matter what I did?

**TL;DR:**  
Friend asked to store her dad’s couch “for two weeks.” I said no, then agreed with a firm limit. She left it for 3.5 years. Couch was destroyed. I tossed it and didn’t tell her. She finally mentioned it in year six. Now she’s upset.

1mcq63z,AITA for leaving work early without telling anyone because it was over 130°F where I work.,"So i (18M) am currently interning at a very prestigious nursery in the Midwest. Its a really big deal for me because the company has government connections, and having this on my resume basically guarantees me future job opportunities. 

But here is the issue. My boss (lets call him MB) has been out of town on vacation for the past week. Normally, he's the one who works alongside me and checks in. But because he is gone his boss (WB), who works out of a completely different office across the state from where I’m stationed, has been “supervising” me remotely using the security cameras in the greenhouses. The greenhouse I work in is about a mile away from mine and my bosses office building, and since MB is gone, I haven’t had access to the air-conditioned office at all. I’ve been stuck at the greenhouses the entire time in the heat. 

Now, the weather has been brutal lately, with highs around 100–105°F. Inside the greenhouse, it's even worse. There’s no fan, no AC, and barely any ventilation. The only way I can cool it down is by opening the roll-up walls about 3 feet, but that doesn’t do much. Even with shade cloth, the temperature inside reached over 130°F today. I was working in those conditions for 6 hours straight before I started feeling lightheaded and got a headache. 

Since I couldn't cool off and had nowhere to rest (again, I had no access to the office), I made the decision to leave about 2 hours early. I didn’t notify WB because I knew she’d be upset, and I don't have any sick leave to use anyway. About 30 minutes after I got home, WB checked the security cameras, saw I was gone, and called me. She asked where I was, and I told her I had gone home because I wasn’t going to keep working in a greenhouse that was 130°F. She told me that if I didn’t return immediately and finish out the day, I’d be suspended with no pay for a week. Problem is, I live about 30 minutes away and can’t work past 5 p.m (it was already 4:30), so there wouldn’t have been enough time to drive back and get anything done. 

So here is where I might be the ass I told her that even if I could make it back in I wouldn't go back in because it was just too hot there and that if she wants to make sure the plants in there are fine she should come out of her nice ac'ed office and try working in there when it is as hot as it is. She then told me her intern isn't having any problem with the heat (she only has one greenhouse to take care of and it actually has ventilation unlike the 6 I have to take care of). So I just gave up on the conversation said I was sorry and hung up. 

So now I might be suspended, and I’m worried it’ll ruin my reputation at this company. I get that I probably should’ve told someone, but I also think I shouldn’t be expected to work in dangerous conditions with no break and no access to AC.

So AITA for going home early without telling my boss?

1m9c0n0,AITA for not telling my dad I will not pay for my brothers college?,"Had an argument with my dad the other day, and he told me that my parents will pay for my college fully but I would have to completely pay for my brothers entire university tuition if I want them to pay for my college. If not, I would have to take out a student loan.

I told him no way I can pay for someone's college tuition right out of college. 

A little bit of background, we are pretty well off and have a nice home in a gated community. My parents afford enough to go on nice trips, they pay for all my extracurriculars, I've never had to work for my family, and I can use their money to go out with my friends. I know I am extremely privileged, and I know based on my parents line of work, they could pay for my brother. My brother is a smart kid and definitely aiming for an out-of-state school, I do not think it is feasible for me to have to pay 80k+ a year with my starting salary to pay off his college tuition.

I said I would definitely help out my parents financially in other ways, but I could not do this. I also have been applying to scholarships so my parents don't have to pay for my college fully.

However, my dad said I am being selfish, and the financial burden on them is too high.

I honestly do not know if I'm wrong or not, so AITA???",KittyNoir1,3010,559,0.9200000166893004,0.1388468779614281,1753480269,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1m9c0n0/aita_for_not_telling_my_dad_i_will_not_pay_for_my/,2025,7,AmItheAsshole,2025-07-25 21:51:09

My son and his friends at the start of the summer came over 3-4 days a week in the morning (like 10-10:30?). to weight lift. I had no problem with it, but after a couple visits they started getting loud. Yelling, playing loud music, etc. I told them tyo calm it down because my daughters are usually still asleep by then and it wakes them up. His friends had no issue with it, but my son did and kept doing it. 

After another warning or two I told him since he wouldn't stop acting up his friends couldn't come over. Of course he was mad, but he got over it in a day or two. My husband thinks that i was too harsh solely on because of the fact that 10am is ""past"" quiet time. But my house isn't an apartment complex, and ""quiet time"" is when I want quiet time to be.

1mbv5wi,AITA for hiding my baby bump and telling the father that he shouldn't bother showing up for the birth?,"I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for 5 years now and I am pregnant with my first baby. We've been trying to get pregnant now for about a year so we were both super excited when we found out. I am now 21 weeks pregnant and have a super noticeable bump. I absolutely adored seeing my bump at first, as did my boyfriend, but now it's something that I've become very insecure about.

For context, I have always looked extremely young for my age. Even though I'm 24, I genuinely still look like a teenager. It's never been something that's bothered me especially, but now that my bump visibly shows, I've noticed that I've been receiving very judgemental looks when I'm out in public. It's blatantly obvious that people think I'm a pregnant teen and they don't like or support it. My boyfriend has never noticed these looks so it's something I've kept to myself. But it's become something so bad to me that it makes me not want to go outside. So I'll wear clothing that hides it the best it can.

My boyfriend has recently noticed this and accused me of not wanting the baby. I tried to explain the real reason I'm hiding it but he ended up telling me ""Maybe you weren't ready to be a mam if you're this embarrassed by it"".

We don't usually fight but hormones have been acting crazy so I just snapped at him. I told him that he should support me during this instead of guilt tripping me and that if he can't even support me through this, then maybe he shouldn't even be around when the baby actually actually gets here, as he'll clearly show no support there either. That not only am I dealing with the physical affects of pregnancy, but I'm also dealing with the emotional affects of it. That everywhere I go I'm being judged like I'm a knocked-up teen girl who made a mistake, and the person who should make me feel the safest is the one ridiculing me.

We haven't spoken properly in a few days, and he's telling me that I overreacted and that he's hurt by what I said. I know I went too far but I was just so angry and hurt.

My sister in laws birthday was last week. I spent the day making it special for her, driving her around to her favorite stores and spots around town until eventually her friends had a suprise birthday party for her that was our last stop. 

She had way too much to drink and I had to drag her out of the party when her mom called me multiple times to get home to pick up our kids. It took me an hour and her friends kept booing me but eventually we were on our way home but she kept demanding I take her to other friends houses the whole time. I said no, it's 8:30pm and we need to pick up our kids. She was upset at me but ended up passing out anyway.

We got to my mother in laws house to pick up the kids and while I was in the bathroom, I heard my mother in law talking to my sister in laws sons and telling them that they can have cake at my house (they were going to stay the night at my house so my sister in law can have a peaceful night).

I was already so frustrated and tired and when I heard that, I was done. I walked out and helped everyone get ready. My mother in law was handing me the cake and asked ""Oh, can you take this?"" I just looked at her and said ""No."" And walked away. 

The boys all pouted and the older one started crying. I just didn't care. I got them all packed up and told them that it's bedtime and we aren't having sugar but we can have cake tomorrow. The older one bawled again and had a fit the whole way home. 

The next day, I brought them over, all the kids had cake, everything was fine. But my SIL and MIL think I overreacted, that I was being horrible and mean to the boys. I wanted to tell them so bad that saying no is not a bad thing but I just kept my mouth shut. It's been a week and they are still bothered by it.

All of them appear to be at least 20 or older except for the youngest Daughter who, at the oldest, was around 13. I take the family back to the room and explain everything, then let them Start the room. The second I sit down in the control to watch them, I notice only the boyfriends, who have never done an escape room, and the mom seem excited and are looking around. The daughters start looking around eventually and even find one of the puzzles for the room. They start working on it and not even 2 minutes go by and the mom swoops in, takes the puzzle, and makes them go look elsewhere as she worked on it. That was how the rest of the room went, the kids would find the stuff, and the mom would take over and make them leave. The youngest, getting fed up with this, decides to just sit down and wait in the first part of the room, (This escape room had 4 separate rooms for them to go through). After the group gets to the 3rd room, the mom storms into the first room and tells the little girl to stop pouting and come join them, then before she can respond, the mother tells her ""You're ruining this experience for everyone.

1m2mp9r,AITA for secretly saving money without telling my partner?,"
My boyfriend is absolutely awful at managing money. We have no savings despite my attempts to start one. We both work, have no kids, no major bills yet we are constantly paying bills late (and their fees), borrowing from cash advances and pawning items for extra cash.I feel like we are on an endless loop of borrowing, spending, paying back, being broke, borrowing again and so on. I’ve tried to reason with him about it and offer my help, but somehow he always ends up managing money the way he thinks it’s “best”. He makes empty promises, telling me that I’ll be in charge of finances the following payday and that he will make sure I can start a savings and have money to treat myself but when Friday comes around, we are either paying late bills or cash advances, leaving no money for anything else. Right now I am supporting us financially for the most part, and he contributes some too but not as much ( currently doesn’t have a steady income, although even when he did, things were the same). As you can imagine, we’ve argued about this a lot to the point I have started to secretly save 20% of my own income separately. He doesn’t know about it, but I’ve accumulated a few thousand dollars already which goes to show that is not that we don’t make enough, or have a lot of bills, it’s his way of allocating the money that’s causing all this stress. Why don’t you do finances separately, you might ask? I’ve tried that but he is adamant about doing it his way. I feel like it’s wrong for me to do what I’m doing though, even if the money is just from my paycheck, because when he found a small stash of cash I had in the drawer in the past, he became extremely upset and accused me of “keeping money a secret”.

1lu5np0,AITA for leaving my stepmom’s lake house abruptly after she called my daughter a brat?,"Over the Fourth of July, my wife and I visited my stepmom at her boyfriend’s lake house with our two daughters (7 & 6). The girls had been staying with them the week prior. On Saturday, my daughter and another girl asked to leave the lake early to play in the hot tub. My stepmom said no, and my daughter got upset and cried.

The other girl then asked her, “What do you even like about her?” and my daughter said, “She has a new house and money.” Not the most thoughtful thing to say, but she’s seven, and the lake house had just undergone a big renovation.

The other girl ran and told my stepmom what was said. My stepmom had been drinking all day and clearly took it personally. Later, I saw her walk up to my daughter (sitting quietly on the couch), get in her face, and say, “You make me so sad.”

I immediately stepped in, told her to stop, and sent my daughter out of the room. I told my stepmom not to talk to my kid like that, and we started arguing. I asked if we could speak privately—there were  a dozen people in the room 10 feet away—but she refused and kept saying my daughter was “spoiled and entitled,” and that it was clear how we really felt about her.

I told my wife we were leaving and went to pack. We had planned to stay until Sunday, but I didn’t feel comfortable anymore. My wife supported me, even though I could tell she wasn’t fully on board.

While packing, my stepmom came upstairs still being defensive. We got into a shouting match. I told her I didn’t care about her money and never wanted a dime from her. She kept bringing up how “entitled” my daughter was. She walked out, and I continued packing.

As I was loading the car, her boyfriend came out and told me he didn’t think we should come back. He said she was “heartbroken,” but I let him know I appreciated his hospitality. He hadn’t been involved in the conflict at all.

Before leaving, I asked my stepmom if she wanted to say goodbye to her granddaughters. She wouldn’t speak or look at me. Later, she came outside and said goodbye to the girls. I told her I loved her, and she snapped, “You have a hell of a way of showing it. I doubt it.”

That started another argument. Her boyfriend confirmed he had said we shouldn’t come back. When she asked if he was going to say goodbye to the girls (he’s been in their lives since they were toddlers), he hesitated, then stuck his head in the car for a quick goodbye. She’d never act that way with his grandkids.

We argued once more, and she ended up calling my daughter a brat. That was it. I said we were done and left without saying goodbye to anyone else in the house.

TL;DR:

My 7-year-old made an offhand comment about my stepmom having money. Another kid repeated it. My stepmom, who had been drinking, confronted my daughter, called her a brat, and I decided to cut our trip short. I know this is just my side of things, but I’m still struggling with how it all went down.",kylefsu32,995,825,0.7699999809265137,0.1164838072721433,1751921464,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1lu5np0/aita_for_leaving_my_stepmoms_lake_house_abruptly/,2025,7,AmItheAsshole,2025-07-07 20:51:04
1lv1o01,AITA for telling my husband to choose between me and his smart home obsession?,"I (33F) have been married to Alex for 5 years. He was always into tech, which was fine, the last couple years have gotten out of control with his obsession with making our house ""smart.""

It started innocently with some smart bulbs and a video doorbell. But now everything in our house needs an app or voice command to work. Every door has a smart lock, every window has smart blinds, every outlet has a smart switch, there are smart sensors on all faucets, and he even got a smart toilet I can't figure out how to flush without my phone. (I'm way past asking)

Yesterday was my breaking point. I left work early with a terrible migraine and my phone almost dead at 2% battery. All I wanted was to get inside, take my meds, and rest in a dark room. But our WiFi was down so the smart lock wouldn't work. My phone died before I could try the backup cellular system he installed.

I had to sit on our front porch in the sun with my migraine for two hours waiting for Alex to return. He had disabled the regular key lock because it was a ""security vulnerability."" I borrowed our neighbor's phone to call him, but he was in meetings with his phone on DND.

When he arrived, instead of apologizing, he got excited about adding more backup systems to prevent this from happening again. He completely missed that I don't want more tech solutions. I just want to enter my house without needing an app.

This morning made things worse. I couldn't make coffee because he replaced our normal coffee maker with a fancy smart one that ""learns our preferences"" but needs WiFi to work (which was still down). Even the microwave was unusable because it's connected to his system.

I snapped. I told him he needs to choose between me or this smart home obsession. I'm done living in a house where I need tech support just to turn on lights or use the bathroom. He got defensive, saying I'm being dramatic and should appreciate how he's ""improving"" our home. He claims I'm ""holding back progress"" and this is how all homes will be soon.

Here's the thing: I'm a software developer myself, so I understand home automation. But this isn't about convenience anymore. It feels obsessive and controlling. He's spent thousands on this system and keeps adding more complicated features.

1mcqd6e,AITA for giggling at a family's problems during an HOA meeting?,"This happened this past Sunday. My dad and stepmom are out in a small trip and I'm pet sitting their cat and staying at their apartment whirl they're out.

My dad asked me to attend the ""HOA"" (not sure how to call it, we live in Mexico and we don't have an HOA in the US sense) meeting due to some points about renovations,and other important issues would be touched upon.

During the meeting, there was an ""open mic"" moment to discuss other matters in a more neutral way. One of the neighbors, a woman that we'll call Carol, raised a concern about the ongoing issue with the ""gang"" that's been terrorizing the complex for a while now, and how nothing had been done to stop this.

The gang in question? a group of kids between 6 to 10 yo

Their ""clear gang activities""? talking about games in the elevator/corridors, playing in the main plaza after school, going from tower A to B to pick some of the other kids, or getting toys out to go play.

I know some of them, they sometimes come to the apartment asking for bandaids or get one of my nephews to go play with them, really good kids imo, most outrageous thing they've done was hit a garden light with a ball and breaking it, which they took full accountability for and told management as soon as it happened.

According Carol, the kids are an issue and they make her feel HIGHLY uncomfortable, because she can tell all of them are ""up to no good""

Her daughter, a mid teens, added that she feels so insecure when she's home alone cuz more than once the kids have come up to her door and tried the door handle, banged on it, and that they've even tried picking the lock.

Mind you, her apartment is across from my dad's, and the kids only knock on his twice a week when my nephew is there. And that she also felt unsafe walking anywhere near the plaza because she felt ""perved on"" by, again a bunch of kids between 6-10yo.

The husband was also very mad cuz according to him, he's seen them running around the underground parking lot, and I quote, ""Keying cars and trying to open them, probably to steal the cara or whatever is inside!"", which cannot be true because all minors need to be accompanied by an adult or a security guard to access the parking area, to avoid any accident.

I couldn't help it and snorted, then giggled when Mr. Dad added that whole bit about kids trying to steal cars, cuz as we all know, kids are into that kind of stuff. Carol began to ask what was so funny and why I thought that ""gang"" activity was funny, when I could be the next one to be attacked. I probably messed up by telling her that, I doubt that a bunch of kids who look for anthills to kick are crime masterminds, which of course got a couple of giggles from other neighbors.

Carol is now mad at me and my dad for raising ""someone who supports gangs"", my dad doesn't give a shit because he hates Carol, and my stepmom is also mad at me for not taking this seriously.

1mdifn8,AITA for not inviting a stranger our pastor told us to invite over for Christmas Eve with just my husband and I?,"So, this a throwback and the people involved besides my husband are no longer a part of my life at all. But therapy is weird and while working through something else entirely the memory of this situation popped out from wherever it was laying dormant in my brain and hasn't gone away since. So, I shall ask you, oh dear citizens of Reddit, AITA here or was the pastor out of pocket?

Let me set the scene: It is Christmas eve early 2000s. It is below freezing outside and snow is blowing lightly around. My husband and I are alone, but will be going to visit family the next day. We used to have our celebration on Christmas eve just us, then go to the big family event the next day. 

There was a guy our pastor was helping out, around 20 years old. My spouse and I were early 20s as well. The only thing the pastor new for certain about us was we didn't have kids and we didn't have plans for Christmas eve that involved other people. Or maybe he didn't know the second part and just assumed? Unclear. 

Anyway, hubs and I went out for our annual Chinese food meal and to hang out looking at Christmas lights then planned to watch a movie or something at home. While out at dinner husband got a call from our pastor telling him that he'd sent the guy we didn't know (we'll call him Brian) to our house because we weren't doing anything and thought we should be kind and share our Christmas eve with the man. Let me be so clear that this was never discussed prior. 

Well, he sent the guy to our house on a dang bicycle in freezing temperatures and was irate when we didn't leave our food to go visit with Brian. We were lectured about Christian love and how we were not being good Christians by not inviting Brian along. What? 

So, we eventually go home, Brian is on our couch (presumably he was told to just go in? We lived way out in the country so the doors weren't locked.) I'm shaking with anger. I tersely said goodnight and went to bed because I was not dealing with a relative stranger when my little introverted heart had been promised one night of peace out of the week of chaos.  All of this was reported back to the pastor by Brian who was so hurt and put out by us not being there when he arrived. 

I thought nothing of it honestly until months later I asked the pastor for a letter of recommendation which he willingly gave only to find out he wrote horrible things about my character and my uncharitable nature. Based, I can only assume, on that event since I served regularly at the church and helped quite a lot of people if I'm being honest. Which this pastor would have known. So. Am I the Asshole?

1lzyqp8,AITA for not kashering the kitchen for my son?,"Throwaway blah blah. I grew up Orthodox Jewish but it wasn’t the lifestyle for me and I left while remaining very culturally Jewish. My husband is Jewish and I raised our children to be very in touch with their cultural identity (sent them to Jewish schools and sleepaway camps) but don’t really practice the religion in terms of keeping the Sabbath, following the dietary laws, etc.

Our son is 19 and has, over the past two years, become pretty religious. He spends the Sabbath with friends, which is fine with us. We have tried to compromise on the dietary laws by purchasing kosher meat/poultry for him, not mixing meat and dairy, etc. we live in an area with a large Jewish community and he has cart blanche to use Apple Pay to buy himself whatever food he wants. 

Because I grew up in the community I know the rules and do the best I can for him while not limiting myself to a culture that I chose to leave.

I recently found out from one of my other kids that he is annoyed that we haven’t converted one of our ovens (we have two) into a kosher oven for his use, or purchased separate dishes for him etc.

Sibling was like “Did you ask Mom and Dad to do any of this?”

Son was like “no, mom grew up with all of this so she definitely knows what I need and is choosing not to do it.”

Sibling pointed out he can’t be mad if he doesn’t ask while ALSO pointing out that Son is 19 and that this is our house and if he’s that pressed he can get his own place and do what he wants.

Fact is, I don’t want to. I cook and bake a lot. I like having two ovens. I don’t want to relive the exhaustion of a kosher (semi-kosher) kitchen, though I could.

1m527cz,AITA for wanting my parents to pay me the money back that my brother stole from me,"My brother (14) has been stealing cash from my bedroom for almost 2 years now. I rarely have cash but when I do I either put it in my desk or in my wallet. I used to just leave it out but then some of it, or all of it, would randomly disappear and I would get in trouble for loosing it even though I knew it wasn't me. So about a year ago I asked my brother if he really did steal from me the one time almost 2 years ago now and he laughed and confirmed that he did. I still have not got that money back and probably never will.

Because I'm pretty forgetful I always leave my wallet in my purse which is always in my room, I've tried to hide it from him before but then I end up just forgetting about it myself so I went back to just leaving it in my purse. In the last 3 months since I've been home from uni he's stolen over 150 dollars from my wallet, as well as earbuds and full cans of alcohol that I left in the fridge. I'm broke and trying to save money for school, so I work hard for the money I make. Any money or anything that I buy myself is pretty important to me no matter what it is.

My parents say it's my fault because I should be hiding my stuff better but its frustrating to have to hide my own things in my own room. I want to ask them if they could pay me back all the money that he's taken, even though it's not there fault, but every dollar counts for my savings. Idk what I should do.

It could go to photos, but not be in them.  It'll be off to the side for the 10-15 minute ceremony.  In preliminary discussions with our photographer we've brought this up.

We booked it 18 months out. For context, and without revealing too much, it's THE venue in our area, and it has been Amy's dream wedding spot in all of her pinterest boards.

Last month, my sister -- let's call her Carol (48F) -- found out her cheating ex-husband -- let's call him Mark (50M) -- proposed to his coworker (28F) who he had been having an affair with. The woman posted engagement photos from the same venue... Specifically the beautiful beach area where Amy plans to have her ceremony.

Carol is obviously destroyed. She called me sobbing, begging me to change venues. Says she can't watch Amy get married where Mark proposed to a girl younger than his own daughter. Can't smile for photos on THAT beach.

I feel sick for her. I do. But:

* $20K non-refundable deposit
* Save-the-dates already sent
* Amy's dreamed of this venue since high school
* Everything else is booked or 3x the price

I told Carol I can't lose $20K and crush Amy's dreams because Mark is trash. Carol says I'm choosing money over her mental health. That I'm forcing her to relive the worst betrayal of her life for ""pretty pictures.""

I also talked to Amy about it and she does not want a venue change. That it's not her fault Mark -- who has been out of all out lives for the last 5 years -- ruined that place for Carol. Carol called Amy a ""spoiled brat who wouldn't understand real pain.""

Now Carol's skipping Thanksgiving. Half the family says I'm heartless. The place is cursed anyway, why should we host Amy's big day there.

1mydhz6,AITA for not cancelling our long-planned trip because my MIL scheduled surgery at the same time?,"My husband and I have a big trip planned for 5 weeks from now. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime type of vacation,15 days on the other side of the world, over 27 hours of flights each way. We’ve been planning and saving for it for over 6 months. Both of us work very stressful jobs and very rarely get the chance to take any time off like this.(never did on the last 12years) 

  


My MIL (70) has several health problems. She recently scheduled a complicated surgery for exactly the same time we’ll be away. (She knew we were away) We were not consulted about the timing. There’s almost no other family around, and the few relatives who live about 40 minutes away either don’t drive, have jobs, or simply can’t/won’t help her during recovery.

  


We don’t have the option to reschedule our trip without losing a significant amount of money, and honestly, we suspect she chose these dates partly for attention or to create conflict, there were other possible dates.

  


Now there’s pressure on us to cancel and be there for her, but we feel that after all the time, money, and energy we put into this trip, and how rarely we get breaks, it’s unfair to expect us to change our plans.

I also have two children (8m and 6f) from a previous relationship with Alex (32f), and we have 50/50 custody, however, Alex travels a lot for work so we have the kids more than that most of the time, so we get child support from her. 

Before we got married, Allie and I spoke extensively about what we wanted, and she was adamant about being a stay at home mom. I was upfront with her that I was fine with that, we’d be able to afford it, but she would need to be a SAHM for all of the kids to be able to make it work. She agreed happily. 

So as you can probably predict, she sat me down the other day and told me that she wants, at minimum, her first year as a mom to only be a SAHM to our shared baby. She said after that she can help out more with the other kids, but wants to protect her first time motherhood and said it’s her number one boundary. 

I told her that would no longer work, then, I couldn’t support a family of five on just my salary without help with all of the kids. She said I needed to figure it out and respect her boundaries, but this simply won’t be possible. We have family to help for sure but she’s saying she doesn’t want to be responsible for the older kids at all the first year. Also, we want at least one more child and I’m now worried she’ll try to extend the year with another baby. She’s incredibly hurt and angry, but I don’t think it would even be possible to respect her boundaries.

1mqbll1,AITA for laughing when my wife fell and pooped her pants because I thought it was a prank ?,"I (33m) think my wife (31f) is genuinely funny but her love of pranks and toilet humor can be a bit much. One day, I was in the living room. My wife ran in holding her tummy. She slipped and fell. Then she said something like, crap I pooped my pants. 

Everything about it, seemed like a prank she would do. From the double meaning phrase, to the toilet humor, to the physical comedy. Despite the fact that I dislike most of her pranks, I found this one funny. But it wasn't pranking, when I realized, I tried to help her up. She told me not to touch her. 

She sarcastically called me husband of the year for laughing at her. I explained but she said I should have known it wasn't a prank because she did a similar one before and she doesn't repeat the same pranks.

1n03to6,AITA if I don’t clarify that I am a type 2 diabetic?,"I (30F) was diagnosed with TYpe 2 diabetes last year. Thru a program at my job, I can get Dexcom continuous monitors for free as long as I participate. So why not? 

Occasionally, someone will notice it and ask me what it is (because I cover it with a cute patch) and I’ll tell them it’s a Dexcom CGM. 

The people I don’t have to tell? Old people who have Dexcoms and Type 1 diabetics of any age. They see it and know immediately what it is. 

The old people typically don’t know there’s a difference between T1D and T2D but the T1D usually assume I’m also T1D because of my age. 

I recently had someone I see regularly notice my Dexcom and I noticed they seemed more interested in me afterwards. Talking About different things, fav snacks and CGMs, late lunches and feeling shaky, etc. Eventually they asked something about my insulin pump. I clarified that I didn’t have one, they seemed shocked and asked what I do then? I told them I’m pretty well controlled with diet (I made massive changes) and Mounjaro. They then got snide and accused me of being an ahole by misleading them and pretending I was a type 1 diabetic and that I should have clarified that i have the diabetes that I did to myself, which is different than having diabetes done to you like a type 1 diabetic. They are avoiding me now and also pointing out to people that I am type TWO diabetic, not type ONE. 


Now I’m questioning if I’m suppose to explain that I’m type 2 diabetic specifically so that I don’t accidentally end up masquerading as a type 1 diabetic??

1n2pul2,AITA for telling my husband to wipe better after pooping?,"My husband (39m) & I (39f) are in a days-long fight about his toilet habits.

We’ve been married for 13 years. It has not been all rainbows & sunshine, so we’ve been going to couples counseling for a few months now.

The argument:

Sometimes when I go to the bathroom, I see that my husband pooped, but forgot to flush. I didn’t say anything at first bc he works hard & he’s a busy man. However, it started happening more frequently the past couple months (once/twice a week I’d find his poo in the toilet), so I finally brought it up. Just like “Hey, [this scenario] has been happening more lately. Not a big deal. Please try to remember to flush.” He was apologetic, & said he would make an effort. Cool.

Less than a week later, I went to the bathroom and got another brown peekaboo. No poop, but a bunch of toilet paper streaked with poop was sitting in the toilet. So I told my husband, “you forgot to flush again”. He replied “oh, yeah, I guess I did leave a bunch of toilet paper in the toilet. Sorry about that, it won’t happen again.” I replied, “No, it wasn’t just toilet paper. It was a bunch of *poopy* toilet paper.” I wanted to be clear about what the problem was, I didn’t want him to think I was just nagging about some lingering *plain clean* TP in the toilet. I feel like he has a history of downplaying or invalidating concerns that I voice to him, and I didn’t want that happening in this situation.

He got defensive after I clarified that. It seemed like he wanted to explain why there was poopy TP, but no poop. Personally, I didn’t really think much about that until *he* brought up that point. He shouted “DO I HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU?!?!” I was like, “ummmm, I guess so. I don’t think there’s a super obvious reason for a bunch of poopy TP hanging out on its lonesome. And I don’t like the condescending aggressive tone you’re speaking to me with.” He continued yelling about how sometimes he doesn’t get fully clean after pooping & initial wiping, so his butthole ends up feeling itchy later in the day, and so he’ll wipe it before getting in the shower. Hence, the poopy TP that he forgot to flush.

From there, it totally blew up into a screaming match. I told him that he should just properly wipe his butt immediately after pooping. At some point in the yelling, he accused me of trying to shame and embarrass him. I said “Well that’s not my intent, but yeah, a grown adult SHOULD be properly wiping after going to the bathroom!!!!! And I know I would certainly be embarrassed if I was you rn! wtf??”

We haven’t really been speaking for a few days. He said he’s sorry, but also thinks I should apologize, & he’s being aggressive about it.

It was never my intent to make him feel badly. But I’m unwilling to apologize when he’s being so aggressive and accusatory. Yesterday, he told me in anger that I need individual therapy for my behavior.

Considering our current work in couples counseling, I think we both could’ve been nicer during this exchange.

Nobody had been back to maintain the memorial site for at least 5 years. It was overgrown, the cross was rotting and falling apart, most of sign  they left was faded and unreadable. 

So I was planning on putting a privacy fence around my property and it goes right through the memorial site.  Because of the state of it I ended up just clearing it all out and built the fence last year.

1mvtfit,"AITAH for kicking out my friend's neurodivergent friend, for what I felt was ignoring boundaries and touching my most personal stuff?","I'm just super annoyed that I'm made to be the bad guy but in case I'm missing something, here it is. 

My friends have a buddy (uses pronouns they/them), they bring along who is on the spectrum and high-functioning. They can drive, live independently, clearly make friends, and hold down a job - so personally, I think they can understand and respect boundaries. 

They have this annoying and disgusting habit of burping really hard, effortfully, so it is loud. And I have a sensitive nose and it smells. I don't care they do that but when it's in my literal personal space, less than three feet, that's an issue. 

I told them several times not to do that when they are literally facing me and talking to me, facing me, or eating right next to me, with an entire plate of food being passed around. 

The end of my patience was then met when I had a gathering and they invited them. They (their friend), came in and I was warm to them, then when I go to the bathroom, I come back looking for them to tell them we are eating dinner. Lo and behold they are playing with my hearing aids I put in a device to dry them out since it was raining.  (My friends just speak louder around me when they are off)

I literally need those for work and my safety, and other people playing with, let alone wearing them, is unsanitary. 

I flipped out and told them to put those down and he burped in my face, laughing, saying they was sorry and tried to hug me. They drop one of my hearing aids on the floor and almost spill their drink on it, the puddle barely touching it as I grabbed it. 

These are $3000 each...

I told them to let go and my friends were trying to get me to understand that they has trouble with these social cues. My response was:

  
""I'm allowed to decide what I put up with in my personal space and who handles my medical devces. Anybody who can hold down a job, make friends, and live alone should be able to respect boundaries. I don't care if they're on the spectrum, that doesn't mean anything on this.""

1mguwxz,AITAH for suggesting to my husband that we put his mother in a home?,"I (45f) and my husband (56m) are going through a rough patch. Recently, his mother’s (78f) health issues have been getting worse and the doctor has recommended she receive full time care. Previously, she lived alone, but nurses would come every other day to check on her. My husband thinks the best course of action in moving her into our home. 

My issue is that I do not want my mother in law living with us. She’s always been very rude to me and my daughter (11f). She was originally against me marrying my husband because we come from two different faiths (he’s Morman, I’m raised Lutheran but personally agnostic), and because I’m not as “traditional” as she would like me to be. She is a very traditional woman who believes in rigid gender roles for women. She’s attempted to push this belief on my daughter by making comments about what my daughter wears and does. 

She has made comments to my daughter like, “wear leggings with your dress, or else you make God upset. And when God’s upset, he sends people to bad places.” This has made my daughter feel very ashamed and paranoid. She has also expressed disdain for when my daughter said she wanted to become a veterinarian. My mother in law said, “A proper lady should not work outside the home. Focus on raising a family.” (She also hates me because I work, and was very against this.) 

She does not hold the same sentiment towards my son (8m). She shows clear favoritism towards my son while consistently criticizing everything my daughter does. 

While my husband typically defends me in front of his mom, he is adamant we move her into our house. His reasoning is that she is too sick to take care of herself, and his only other brother is ill fit to take care of her (he’s in rehab). 

I suggested, “Then put her in a retirement home,” which made him incredible angry. He says that at the end of the day this is his mother, and he has a duty towards her. He promised that if she moves in, he will talk to her about her attitude towards me and our daughter. However, I don’t want to raise my kids anywhere near her. She has been shaming my daughter, and I barely get along with her. 

Last night, out of anger, my husband said, “You can move out of the house, but I’m not moving my mother into a retirement home!” 

AITAH for suggesting my mother in law be sent to a home? 

Edit: 
Since people are asking, we will continue to have nurses check on my mother in law. My husband wants her to move in and switch nurse visits from every other day to everyday.

1mtzhcw,AITA for not canceling long standing plans for a BBQ that I just found out about?,"My wife and I made plans back in January with a group of friends to go to a beer festival in the mountains. My father in law has a rental property in the mountains which we reserved for the weekend and we all got tickets to the festival. It’s 3 families and some other friends so about 9 people total. 

The festival is Labor Day weekend, and my grandparents invited us and some other family to a barbecue that weekend, but we won’t be able to attend because we’re doing the beer festival. I texted my grandpa and let him know we wouldn’t be able to make it because we already had plans that weekend, and he said he understood and that it was no problem. 

But then my mom texted me asking why we couldn’t come. And I told her why. She told me she’s very disappointed, and that I need to make this barbecue a priority and that I should cancel the plans to go to the beer festival. She then goes on to guilt trip me saying my grandparents are in their 80s and we won’t have many more opportunities to get together. (For context we live in the same state/city as my grandparents and we see them 2-3 times a month minimum.) She told me a beer festival is not a good reason to “blow off” my grandparents and that I need to reconsider my priorities. 

I told her I couldn’t cancel, the house is booked and the tickets are paid for. And I told her that if it was just our family and no friends going that we’d forego the festival and come to the barbecue but that I didn’t think it was fair to our friends to cancel long standing plans for a barbecue that we just found out about, not to mention telling them that they’d either have to eat the cost of the tickets, or find a different place to rent. 

I told my mom that if it was any other weekend, or even Monday of the long weekend instead of Saturday that we’d be there and we aren’t blowing them off, it’s a scheduling conflict but she disagrees and is still very pissed off at me.

1n1rv7g,"AITA for screaming at my FIL for 30 minutes straight after he called MIL ""stupid"" for how she packed a cooler, and telling MIL if she doesn't take control of the situation that I'm taking adult-custodianship of them and putting them in separate old folk homes?","In-laws are visiting and they're driving me insane. FIL refuses to do anything himself. Literally whine-screams from the guest room, ""I'M! HUN!GRY!"" and expects MIL to fix him a plate at any hour. He's refused every outing and bonding experience we've tried to make. I got tired of hearing him scream at her from behind closed doors. This time I heard him say, ""No, move that over there. No, put it there. You're so fucking stupid, (MIL's name)!"" He's so used to getting his way and I have HAD IT with his attitude. He's used to throwing his weight around because he's tall and loud. But now he's too old to be loud and he went full Hank-Hill-ass anyway because he almost never gets out of bed (by choice, not because of being disabled, he's just lazy)

  
So I stormed in and yelled at him that he does not treat his wife like this in my house. He tried to say it wasn't my business, but it is my business whenever I can hear it because I'm half-deaf, so it takes a lot.

 He tried to say they've been married for 50 years and ""we work it out our own way"" and I said, ""well you're in my house so its my way or the highway. You do not talk to the person you love like that in my fking house!"" 

  
I was full banshee-screeching at him and frequently over him as he struggled and stumbled with excuses.

  
He'd say shit like he ""didn't say anything wrong"" - ""yes you did, you called her mean names. A good man doesn't call his wife names!"" 

He said ""she WAS being stupid so (he) HAD to"" -, ""no, you made a choice, the WRONG CHOICE IN MY FKING HOUSE!"" 

He would backtrack and lie.  So I asked, ""did you or did you not call her stupid?"" he went off on another ramble about how long they've been married, so I screamed over him, ""YES! OR! NO!"" Until he finally admitted yes. 

I told him that he needed to apologize to her. He said he would ""Talk to her"" privately. I refused and said I needed to hear it because I know behind closed doors he's going to continue disrespecting her. 

He called me a bitch. I told him that if he wants to have a relationship where we all cuss and hurl names at eachother, then he's a fucking pussy who can't man up to his own actions when he's in the wrong. My wife got home and broke it up, then she took a turn screaming vs him too (because she did not like that he called me a bitch for refusing to back down against him).

  
My wife and I sat down with MIL. We told her that if she doesn't actively make steps towards getting home healthcare for FIL that I will be calling APS, assuming adult custodianship of both of them, and sending them to separate care homes. We gave her the choice of whether to divorce or not, but we made it clear we expect her to stop taking care of him herself.

The first few times it was with permission and I'd agreed and lent her my stuff but now I’ll just wake up and see her walking around the kitchen wearing one of my shirts like it’s normal. I never said she could freely take anything.

1mwp6wp,AITA for not canceling plans to be there for the birth of a “friend’s” baby?,"So I (27F) reconnected with a childhood acquaintance (29F) recently when she moved to my city. My dad and her mom used to work together. We weren’t close growing up, but when she moved to my city around 5 months pregnant, she reached out. I know how lonely it can be to move somewhere new, so I agreed to hang out and tried to help her settle in. When I moved here, I didn’t know anyone either. And now I’m the only one she knows. 

At first it was fine, I did little things like I drove her to look at apartments (she didn’t have a car), helped her run errands, and my dad even built her furniture when she got an apartment. My dad came to visit me for the weekend and we spent it helping her settle in. She has no support system, the baby’s dad is out of the picture, and she’s unemployed (not sure how she’s funding everything). I genuinely wanted to be kind and supportive. I even introduced her to some of my friends and she was so rude to them and then wouldn’t stop talking poorly about them. 

But then things escalated. She started demanding I go with her everywhere.. doctor’s appointments, grocery shopping, even to do nails. She started jokingly calling the baby “our baby” because I’ve been around so much. She’ll say things like “our baby is craving fries from McDonalds” and beg me to get them for her. She even offers to pay me. She refuses to use meal delivery apps because she doesn’t trust that they won’t do something to the food, she says. 

This has been going on FOR MONTHS. 

Fast forward: I’m a bridesmaid in my best friend’s wedding and flying home (Puerto Rico) for 4 weeks to help with the shower, rehearsal, wedding, and even organizing her closet in her husband’s apartment while she’s on her honeymoon (they don’t live together until after the wedding). When my acquaintance came over and saw me packing, she lost it. She said I never told her about my trip. She said she was counting on me to be there for the birth (which will definitely happen while I’m away, I leave tomorrow and she’s ready to pop any minute), and even expected me to MOVE IN with her for the first month after the baby was born to “help out,” since I have nanny experience. She also told me she was planning on me watching the baby on the days I work from home (2 days of the week). 

I told her I wasn’t canceling my flight or shortening my trip, and now she’s furious, saying I’m abandoning her and the baby. That I’m all they have. She’s posting about me on social media saying I betrayed her. Her mom, who lives in our state just 4.5 hours away, is commenting and encouraging her. 

I told my mother about this and she also said I was a bad friend to leave her and her baby when they need me, that she agrees moving in is a lot but I should be there during birth, only travel for the wedding, and then come back to help with meals, etc. and told me she won’t be picking me up at the airport tomorrow because she knows I’ll do the right thing.

The whole shebang. We have 7 kids together and this regards our baby girl LaLa.(20F)

Her boyfriend came to me a little over a month ago and asked me for her hand and also asked if he could propose at the vow renewal. Hes a great guy ans we get along super well and i genuinley like him for my daughter. I, said yes to both originally and was super excited. A few weeks pass ans he asks can he also invite a few family members of his, i was expecting maybe his parents and siblings, but he instead sends me a list of 25 family members he wants to add. I have a few problems with this. 

1. His family does NOT like my daughter. Thwy are Asian and do not like that their son is with a black woman. And considering nearly everyone else there will be black...
2. He expects us to fund these people.like regular guest. As I mentioned this would be just like a wedding. So 25 extra people is a LOT of money 

I told him i couldn't accommodate that many people, he got angry and said I wss ruining his special moment and that I ""don't really care about Lala"" and said I can't do anything if thwy just show up. I said they absolutely will not show up. I then told him he still had my hand/permission to marry my daughter, but he was not allowed to propose at the vow renewal.

She woke up around an hour later and I gave her a forehead kiss. That's become a bit of a thing for us. I always give her a forehead kiss when we wake up in the morning. I also do it when she wakes up from naps. It's to the point that it's habit now.

A little while later my step brother pulled me aside and demanded I stop forcing my perfect relationship down his throat.

1mpfvtl,AITA for not paying for a wedding I’m not attending?,"I (30f) started a relationship with Joe (31m) in the middle of May of this year. Shortly after we started going out, he asked me to be a plus-one to his friend Meg’s wedding. i have never met Meg, but I agreed to go. We RSVPed, and Joe booked plane tickets and a hotel room.

A couple days ago, I ended the relationship with Joe. It’s important to note that while money was not the main reason for the breakup, it was one of the things we argued about most. I am very frugal (perhaps to a fault), and Joe likes to spend money on creature comforts and trips, and often expects me to do the same. Joe lives at home rent free, while I have my own apartment. I live pretty much paycheck to paycheck, with a small stash set aside in savings.

There’s still about five weeks left to the wedding. I ended the relationship when I did partly because I didn’t want to be in the pictures from the wedding and cause people to feel bad when they looked back at those pictures. I am returning everything Joe left in my apartment, save a few things he was okay with me keeping. I also offered to pay for my plane ticket and my half of the hotel stay as a good-faith gesture. It comes to over $400, which is just about everything I have in savings.

Today, Joe contacted me and asked if I could pay another $125 on top of all of that to offset Meg’s costs for my plate and everything at the reception. He says it’s so close to the wedding and since deposits have gone to vendors, I should pay my portion. I think that more than a month’s notice is ample time for Meg to either fill the seat or for Joe to find another plus-one, who would also be benefitting from my paying half of the hotel stay. I also think that since I wouldn’t pay that money if I was attending, then I shouldn’t have to pay now that I’m not. It’s my understanding that people not going to weddings after they RSVP is just one of those costs that’s inevitable, and I’m at least doing Meg the courtesy of giving over a month’s notice.

1mg2mmf,AITA for not co-signing a mortgage agreement for my parents?,"I (21f) have been asked by my parents to cosign a home mortgage worth 200k with my brother (22m). For context, my dad and brother lives 3 hours away from my mom and my other siblings because of work. I live in another province for military posting reasons.

My dad and brother are currently paying rent, and they’re looking to buy a house. However, my dad has filed for bankruptcy and my brother has only been working for 3 months at his new job so he might not get approved. That’s why they need me to co-sign for my name and ID. They told me I won’t be paying anything because I wont need to put my banking information. That my brother and dad will pay it and i just have to act as a cosigner. 

This is my first time doing something like this, especially taking in a big commitment such as a home that I won’t even be living in. So naturally I started researching about it. I learnt that if my brother fails to pay it off on time and what not, I am financially responsible for it. I asked my mom questions of what it would mean for me to co-sign. I’m pretty hesitant because of my dad’s past history of being in debt.

She did not take it well. She said why am i thinking negatively of things, if i really loved my Dad i wouldn’t even think in this way and just say yes. I told her it’s because i want to think of things realistically and don’t want to be in debt in case my brother can’t pay things off. 

She said that my distrust in my dad is unfair. And that this is the only help i’ll be giving towards my family and I can’t even do it. (mind you, im paying for my mom and siblings’ house insurance, my mom’s phone bill, and other miscellaneous things that they need money for).

I'm a 40 year old veteran and like a lot of vets, I use military discounts when I can. Last week, I went out to dinner with my brother and his fiancée, and a couple of friends. When the check came, I told the server I had a military discount. My brother’s fiancée immediately jumped in and said ""Oh just put it all under his bill so we all get the discount"" 

I could tell the waitress felt uncomfortable because she was about to say no so I told her that’s not how it works and the discount only covers me, and if I’m paying my own tab, fine, but I’m not about to cover a table of six just so everyone can save a few bucks. She called me selfish and said “you didn’t even pay full price to serve, so why hoard the perks now?” That honestly stung. 

I calmly told her that if she wants a military discount, she can enlist. My brother said I was being an ass and making her feel unwelcome in the family. I pointed out that she was the one being disrespectful, but now my mom says I should’ve just “kept the peace” and paid for the table because it wasn’t worth the drama.

1n52g0q,AITA for refusing to give my sister her “dream wedding” dress even though I own it?,"When my grandmother passed away two years ago, she left me her wedding dress. It’s vintage and hand made. She left it to me specifically because I was the oldest granddaughter and was always close to her.

my younger sister is getting married. She asked if she could wear Grandma’s dress. At first, I was open to it. But when I said I’d want it back afterward (since it’s an heirloom and very sentimental to me), she blew up. She said she wants it because its her wedding, which includes cutting it to be shorter

I told her no. If she wants to borrow it that's fine, But if she wants to basically destroy it, then no. Now my entire family is calling me selfish and saying I’m ruining her “dream wedding” just because I want to hoard a dress I’ll “probably never wear.”

I don’t plan to wear it anytime soon, and it will mostly sit preserved in a box. But I also don’t want to lose something so important to me just because my sister wants it.

1mjfh6g,AITA for refusing the sell the crystal I got from my grandmother,"My grandmother collected stones and crystals for decades. About 50 years ago, her brother gifted her a 25 kg crystal (clear quartz geode) he found. (I don't know the exact story).

My grandmother's love for crystals and stones is the reason I started collecting them too. For the last couple of years before she passed away, she would gift me a couple of items from her collection every time I saw her.

She had the giant crystal displayed in her house, and she knew how much I loved it, often telling me if I still collected crystals when she passed away, I would get it. Unfortunately, she passed from cancer when I was 9. Since she had promised me the crystal, my dad got it for safekeeping. I didn't have the space for it in my bedroom, and I have been moving around finishing my degree since I moved out of my parents' house, so the crystal has been at my parents' house since she passed.

I bought my first home earlier this year and got the keys on August 1, so I am in the process of fully moving in. When I started moving into my home, I was offered the crystal, since my grandmother wanted me to have it, and I would finally have space for it, and won't be moving anytime soon.

When I got the crystal, I also got some paperwork from when my grandmother had it valued back in the 90s. It was valued at around 5000 euros (I have no clue if this estimate is even remotely correct today, and don't care since I don't plan on selling it). When my siblings found out the price of the crystal, they got mad that I got something so expensive and wanted me to sell it and split the value between us. I have refused to do so; my grandmother wanted me to have it because she didn't want someone to just sell it. My siblings feel this is unfair since they only got some sentimental items, but nothing worth real money. So AITA for refusing to sell the crystal I got from my grandmother?

1mrd44z,WIBTA if I tell my friend I don't like being around her kid,"I (32m) have a female friend (29f) that has a kid.

I am at the point where I want to tell her to not bring her kid around me. This will be difficult because the kid has grown really fond of me. 


The child is four years old, but I don’t like how she’s allowed to behave. She is still breastfeeding at that age, and she isn’t properly potty trained. To clarify, she can sometimes use the bathroom on her own, but other times she just soils herself. She doesn’t have any mental challenges. On top of that, she has a cellphone that she’s glued to constantly. All of this annoys me, but since she’s not my child, I don’t comment. I mind my own business. 

The bigger problem is that this child cannot take no for an answer. When she’s with her mother, she bullies her by crying hysterically until her mom gives in to whatever she wants. You might wonder how this affects me.

Well, the child often cries hysterically for my laptop or smartwatch. I’m not rich, and I can’t afford for a kid to break my things. Once, her mom left her with me briefly while she went to grab something from the car. During that short time, the child reached for my prescription glasses. When I refused to give them to her, she threw such a hysterical tantrum. The cries were so loud and gut wrenching that people thought I had spanked her.

1mxl5wu,AITA for fencing off my property,"We bought the house we’re currently in about 6 months ago and we recently has a surveyor come to our property to figure out exactly where our property line is so we can put up a fence. The old fence was kind of a hodgepodge of different types of fences that were falling apart. We wanted to have something more uniform and you know, not falling apart. While the surveyor was here, the old lady living next door (noseybody) came out to see what we were doing and we let her know we were planning on putting up a fence. 

Here’s where it goes left but I don’t understand what the issue is. She said that we weren’t allowed to put up a fence and when we asked why, she said her dog was used to having all of not only her backyard but our backyard too because the old owners were okay with it. I don’t have anything against the dog but I also want a fence around our house because we have small children and it makes me feel better to know that we have a fence because there is a small forresty area and a small creek behind our property. 

She started ranting and raving about how young people today are selfish and that I’m an animal hater because I don’t want her dog to have space to roam. I told her that it had nothing to do with her and everything to do with us.

Obviously she is very upset about it and we have been supporting her as much as we can. She is in her 70s, lives 1.5 hours away and has never driven, so getting her to come to us has always been dependent on her and her husband travelling together. As husband and I are starting work again soon, we are wanting to encourage her to come to us more often by public transport, and her staying over would make things easier.

1mzb4ru,AITA For Stealing Back Pokémon Cards My Fiancé's Nephews Took (And Possibly Taking Extras)?,"Hello all, I'm keeping this off my main as my family members know my acct and I don't want them asking me about it just yet. 

To set the background, I'm (29F), my fiancé is (31M), and I have three children (8F, 7F, 5M). Sometime last year my daughter Summer (the 8F) started collecting Pokémon cards that her bio-dad would gift her during visitation. I haven't kept up with the fandom as I aged but collected coins as a kid and loved the idea of helping my daughter grow her collection. I have also supplemented the collection from lucky Goodwill finds. It is about 5 binders worth of cards, with cards from between 1995 to 2018 generally and some are very rare. 

My SIL asked my fiancé if we could babysit her two sons Peter (8M) and Paul (7M) while out of town for the weekend as she has to pick up her husband's nephew for something. I was not keen on this for a few reasons, being:

1) Peter has to attend an alternative school for anger issues and outbursts, and though they have become less frequent I wouldn't know how to handle it if something happens.  
2) Peter has had issues in the past with stealing money from my fiancé and I when we would leave cash out in our room. His mom would get defensive about it but $10 was never something I'd die on a hill for, so I'd usually drop it.   
3) Peter has also tried stealing my daughter's Pokémon cards in the past or my DBZ cards. I took them back but it blemished my relationship with my SIL a tad. 

Despite all this I hoped the weekend could go smoothly as she needed the help, so me and fiancé agreed.

However, last night while I was at work Summer called me and asked if she could 'give her Pokémon cards to Peter'. I could hear Peter whispering in the background. I was very clear in saying NO because I couldn't advise if there would be a fair trade or if he would take the more valuable cards. Later I asked my daughter if she really wanted to give him the cards and she said no. 

This morning while tidying my daughter's room I saw all the Pokémon binders out. I had a bad feeling, opened them up, and discovered HALF THE COLLECTION missing. The binders were full but now there were empty pages and scattered cards missing. I was pissed. I went to Peter's backpack and found some of my DBZ cards, my other daughter's full rock collection, and a massive plastic bag with a bunch of Pokémon cards dumped in. I took everything back and sorted my daughter's cards from Peter's, though I was just going by the card's print dates as Peter only had cards from 2022 and beyond (so I thought). I put the sorted cards in a lunch box.  
  
I told my fiancé at the time this, but Peter and Paul have noticed their card stash is much lighter and started whining in saying that their aunt gifted them some older cards that are missing. I'm sick and tired of them thinking they can just steal whatever they want from our house. AITA for not giving them any cards back, even if some are actually theirs? I'm worried they'll complain to my SIL.

1mt5yg2,AITA for ignoring my friend’s work messages while I’m on maternity leave?,"I’m currently on maternity leave from my job as a social media manager at a small start-up. When I went on leave, my friend actually took over my position (she only joined the company because of me).

Since then, she’s been messaging me constantly. Every other day it’s either questions about work, venting about colleagues, or sending me the content she posts so I’ll like or engage with it. She messages me through both the company account (which I’ve muted) and her personal one.

On top of that, she often asks to come over and “help”; cooking, cleaning, walking the dog, whatever I need. It’s really generous of her, but the problem is that whenever she’s over, the conversation turns into work. The last time she came, she stayed for FIVE hours, and 80% of what we talked about was her job. I even ended up helping her do work because she was stressed, and she straight up asked me to join a meeting with her.

I feel so stuck. I don’t want to hurt our friendship, and I know she’s just trying her best, but this is supposed to be my maternity leave. I’ve already had to tell other coworkers to respect my time, and she even backed me up on that… yet she doesn’t seem to realize she’s doing the same thing.

So lately I’ve just been ignoring the work-related messages (she doesn't seem to get the message). I’ll still reply if it’s something personal, but if it’s about work I don’t answer. Now I’m worried I’m being rude or unsupportive, since she’s obviously struggling and looking for reassurance.

1mxfls7,AITA for not inviting my sister in law to an event I know she would have enjoyed because she’s too judgy?,"I’ve always wanted to like my SIL Macey but she’s judgy about weird shit, like oh it’s superficial to get a designer bag when you should just go to the thrift store and get a $2 bag. But spending $600 on collectibles is okay. (They’re BOTH fine). Sadly this makes her the perfect partner for my brother. You can imagine the kind of personality he has lol.

The best example was when my sister Bee and her wife and a bunch of their friends were going to the Eras tour a few years ago. They’re all queer women too so they love Taylor. Macey thought that because I didn’t go I would be “on her side” and shit talk them, call them vapid and stupid cult members. I said I didn’t go because I’m just.. not a fan. I said she was behaving like a mean girl and to stop. She took offense because SHE was the victim of bullying as a kid. I said well I guess you didn’t learn from it because look at who you’ve become. She wouldn’t talk to me for months. 

Well a few weeks ago I got a ton of free tickets to the renaissance festival. I invited Bee and some other friends. Macey has said in the past she loves Ren Fests. She loves to get dressed up in period accurate costumes. I asked Bee if we should invite Macey and Bee said no, Macey would inevitably make some snarky comments about costumes not being accurate or something and ruin the mood for everyone. I thought about it and in the end agreed. Bee posted pics, Macey saw and asked us why we didn’t invite her. In the end, I told her that it was because I never know what she’s going to judge next. She said that we were bullying her. Bee brought up the Eras tour thing and how nasty Macey was about it and Macey defended herself by saying she never said that stuff TO her and I was wrong for telling her in the first place. 

My brother thinks we should have invited Macey and that we’ve gone out of our way to not be supportive and make her part of the family. I’ve literally had her over for baking Xmas cookies, movies, brunch. She’s never returned the favor. I just did not want to have a day where the mood was soured because of someone being judgy. He did not care about Macey ragging on Bee, either.

1n10ium,AITA for not wanting the puppy my bf bought for my birthday present?,"For context: I (27F) have always had pets dogs, cats, even birds that fell from their nests I also rescued and re-home tons of animals But I’ve never kept a male pet. My mom didn’t like them because of the whole “peeing everywhere” thing, and I guess I just got used to only having girl pets. Plus, I love using my dogs like pillows, and I’ll admit the doggy boy parts that are always a little too present makes me uncomfortable.

Anyway, I’ve had my dog let's call her luna since I was 17. She’s my baby and she 100% rules my life. She’s not really friendly with kids, other dogs, or most men, but she at least kinda likes my boyfriend (31M) of two years.
So, my birthday was a couple weeks ago. My boyfriend told me he had a “surprise” but it wasn’t ready yet. Last Friday, I came home from work and found him in my apartment with a two month old-ish German Shepherd male puppy that he Bought, complete with a balloon tied to its collar that said “Happy Birthday.” He smiled and said, “Do you like him? He’s our new son.”

I was shock the only words that came out were: Where’s luna?
He had locked MY dog in the bathroom because she growled at the puppy. I was furious.
We argued for about two hours. I told him to take the puppy back with him and not to come back he yell some more and called me a “misandrist” before leaving because apparently not wanting male pets = hating men. He also said I was “weird” for being uncomfortable around dog peepees. 

When I told my friends and family, everyone sided with me however my boyfriend keeps sending me videos of the puppy, saying he doesn’t know what to do with it since his apartment doesn’t allow pets especially one that would grow so much and begging me to take it “just until he finds accommodations.” He says I owe him because he spent so much money on the puppy and was planning the puppy to live with me anyway.

But I don’t want the puppy, my current dog definitely wouldn’t accept him, and in the videos I can already see how destructive he's becoming in the other hand the poor puppy is innocent in all this should I just suck it up and keep him with me until my boyfriend (we technically didn't broke up yet) finds somewhere else to take him?
 Also the puppy represent everything I don't want in a pet, I feel like he just bought himself a dog but don't really want to take care of it so he acted like the puppy was my birthday present.

So, AITA for refusing to accept the puppy? Should I just take him in for a while?",cicada_supremacy,2101,723,0.9300000071525574,0.1186649194573381,1756248739,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1n10ium/aita_for_not_wanting_the_puppy_my_bf_bought_for/,2025,8,AmItheAsshole,2025-08-26 22:52:19
1n04mg8,AITA for sitting on the floor in a store?,"I was recently at a big box store with my husband. For the past couple years, I have been having some health issues where I randomly come close to passing out while standing. I’ve been trying to figure out the cause but doctors have been dismissive so far. When I feel an episode coming on, I need to sit down. 

When he was looking at something at the store, I felt an episode coming on. Sometimes it will pass and I’ll be fine, but this one didn’t and I knew I had to sit down. I told him I didn’t feel well and was going to find a place to sit. I pushed it too far and couldn’t find a chair before I HAD to sit down. I felt like I didn’t have a choice but to sit on the floor. I was in a less populated part of the store, so I wasn’t in the way. 

I texted him that I had to sit down and he later came to find me and saw me sitting on the floor drinking my water. He told me in a whisper yell to get off the floor because it was gross and embarrassing but I told him I will as soon as I can, I really need to sit because I felt very unwell. 

I sat on the floor for a total of 10 minutes. After that I was well enough to go find a bench to sit on while I waited for him to finish shopping and then we went home. 

He keeps saying there was no reason I had to sit on the floor in a store and that it was embarrassing for him. He told his parents about it and they agreed that it was weird and that I should’ve sucked it up and I was being dramatic.

1mnsbjr,AITAH my roommate says I can't move out until after her wedding,"I (34f) have been living in hotels and with an ex partner for the last 4 months because my apartment tested positive for mold, which I'm highly reactive/allergic to. At the same time, my 5 year old dog suddenly became severely ill. Her x-rays showed alarming inflammation in her lungs and overnight she was struggling to breathe. I packed a suitcase and left immediately thinking the mold was affecting her also. My plan was to find another place to stay while our landlord remediated the house. 

Devastatingly, only 2.5 weeks later my dog passed away. Her passing was extremely traumatic for me, but I will omit those details. I was in a very, very dark place. Not only did I lose my bestfriend and was living out of a suitcase, I also found out some unfortunate news regarding my own health, all the while being unemployed and living on savings and some generous help from my ex partner.

The night my girl passed away, my ex insisted I move into the extra bedroom of his apartment so I wouldn't grieve alone. He assured me that I could stay for as long as I needed to get back on my feet as well my house to be safe again. We get along super well, and I'm so grateful for his help. 

The whole time I've been here, both of my roommates have been constantly asking when I was coming back. Mind you, I've been paying my $2,200 rent plus utilities this whole time. (I live in SF, lol.) My answer has always been the same: I'm not coming back until the house is remediated. Unfortunately something was delaying the process of it all. 

Last week, I finally decided that I no longer wanted to pay rent for a place that I wasn't living in, especially because I was still unemployed. I knew the timing of my notice was less than ideal because my roommate ""Kate"" (46f), who is the master tenant and responsible for finding a replacement tenant, is in the throws of planning her wedding, amongst other things like talking to a surrogacy agency and immigration for her fiance, and I feel awful. I knew that she wasn't going to take the news well, but her reaction was far more unexpected than I thought.

When I told her I was moving out (7 week notice) she said that the timing didn't work for her and that I was being unkind. She threatened to keep my deposit if I didn't push my move out date by another month. When I told her that was illegal she started to freak out and told me that our friendship would be over. I was in shock. She said ""you knew about the wedding for months!"", but I honestly didn't have the mental clarity to make that big of a decision until very recently. I told her as soon as I knew. 

I can't help but feel horrible and guilty, but all my friends are telling me 7 weeks is more than fair and she is the one being a bad friend. I just have no idea because they are obviously biased. I'm just so tired of being a people pleaser and I would essentially lose over $2k to make it convenient for her.

1n53gml,AITA For reporting the girls that broke into my room?,"Hi, I'm pretty sure I'm not the ass hole in this situation but the girls made me feel really guilty.

On Friday, at around 10pm, two girls knocked on me and my sister's door. I thought that someone might need help or it was our RA so I told my sister to open the door. That's when these girls pushed their way into our room and started filming a room tour of our room for a Tiktok. 

For extra information: 
1. my room was hoarder level messy. Me and my sister have depression and it's really hard for us to keep a room clean + my sister has a chronic illness. We're trying to be better though but this night our room was really messy
2. Me and my sister are obese to put it bluntly. I really didn't want any bullying to come my sister's way. 
3. I was wearing night clothes and I didn't have a wig on and they filmed my wig that was on the table. 

So after they filmed the Tiktok, they left and I was in shock. I told them to not post it anywhere and they said they wouldn't and Left. My sister and I tried to laugh it off but I was really worried that we were going to be posted on the Internet so I got dressed and told a RA.

We found the girls and two RA's made sure that the video wasn't in their camera roll or tiktok drafts. The RAs asked why would they burst into our room without asking to film and they said that they ""Did it to everyone and nobody else had a problem with it"". The RAs said that they could be fined which made me feel really bad because I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't posted anywhere and I'm pretty sure they're athletes and I don't want their chances to be ruined. 

I called a couple of family members because I was traumatized and they agreed that it was wrong but they said if our room was clean, it wouldn't be an issue. It still would've been a problem though because I don't want to be on the Internet looking like that.

We both have debt remaining from school, but we make our payments on time etc. All of this is to say that our relationship is stable and developed and there aren't really any external problems. Our families love each other, we have friends separate from each other, and everything is healthy.

We have one problem though. She is absolutely dead set on naming our kid after her deceased dog from when she was a child. I honestly think this is really strange. We are having a girl and the name isn't a 'human' name (in my opinion). I don't want to say exactly what it is but it's pretty similar to Lucky. I feel uncomfortable about naming our daughter a dog name. I don't think that dogs lives are less valuable than human lives, however our daughter is going to have a life beyond us.

1msal50,AITA for refusing to clean out my grandpa’s house 25 yrs post death.,"AITA for refusing to clean out my dead grandpa’s house? Here’s the story. My grandpa died when I was 15 years old, I am now 40 years old. My grandpa left his house to my aunt. His house is more of a permanent trailer, in a retirement community. My aunt has never been married, never had a serious boyfriend and has no kids. She is very sentimental. She has always made excuses as to why she won’t clean out or sell his house. Her excuses have been: too busy at work, too busy hanging out with friends and she hasn’t figured out what she wants to do with it. In the last 25 years, she has let the house rot. She’s never slept in it, doesn’t keep it up, but does pay the taxes and HOA. About 15 years ago, I offered over and over again to help her clean it out or fix it up. I didn’t want money for it, just wanted to help her so that she could use the place. I am independently successful, so I don’t want the money from the house. My aunt always refused to have me help her with the house. My husband even offered too, she said no. Since the house has been abandoned for so long, she mentioned to me about 5 years ago that animals have gotten into the house and there’s animal poop throughout the home. She has done nothing to clean it up and now there’s years and years of animal feces and maybe even dead animals inside. Fast forward to 2025, my mom passed away and I spent a grueling 3 weeks cleaning out my mom’s house. It was rough! I have 3 kids and had to leave my family to clean out my mom’s house.

I told my aunt that I can clean out her house when she passes, but asked her to please take care of my grandpa’s house herself. He’s been dead for 25 years and I feel like it’s unfair to have me clean that out too. Especially to have to clean out both her home and my grandpa’s house while juggling my own family of 5. My aunt told me, “Oh don’t worry about that. It will be so easy for you and you probably will only have to move out a mattress or two.” This is false, as his house is full of his possessions. It also upset me that she seems to have always expected me to do the work. I did love my grandpa. But his house literally is a hazmat situation with the animal feces, broken pipes, nonfunctional AC and more. She hung up on me when I told her the house would require hazmat suits to clean it out.

A week later, I texted my aunt and told her that it is her responsibility to take care of her father’s house and not mine. That was 5 months ago and she has not replied to me. She normally texts me every week. I’ve been ghosted. My concern is near Thanksgiving and Christmas she is going to show up to my house and pretend everything is fine. What do I do? This aunt has been very controlling and manipulative my entire life. This is the only time I’ve ever stood up to her. Part of me just wants her out of my life forever.

1mmxfgn,AITA for not playing video games for my brother who has a nerve disorder? and not playing games in front of him at all anymore?,"# 

Reposting because I barely got any comments on my other post

My (f17) brother (m16) has a nerve disorder that's gotten worse. He used to like playing video games a lot, but now he can't play video games anymore. He's tried a bunch of adaptive controllers and assistive settings, but they don't really work anymore.

So a few times he's had me play video games for him. Basically, it's me controlling the character, but my brother makes all the decisions for things like skill points, customization, any in game decisions, which direction to go, what quest/mission to do, and stuff like that. He tried doing it with our parents too, but our mom doesn't like violence at all, so she won't, and our dad isn't very good with tech stuff and every single time he needs every little thing reexplained even a lot of the times during the same game session. Then he just keeps on dying, so it doesn't really work.

He enjoys it and keeps asking me to play for him more, but I said no because it's a very unenjoyable activity for me. There's nothing fun about basically just being a verbal input machine for him. Plus, if it's a game I've played before it's so boring and if it's a game I haven't played before it ruins the experience for me.

Also, it takes up a lot of time and makes me not like playing video games so much. I do like playing video games by myself, but I also don't always want to be in front of a screen. So, if I play games for him it takes up my mental capacity for screen time and I don't get to play games for myself.

Still, he wants me to play for him because it's his only way he sort of gets to play and feel like he is involved in the game. I kept refusing though so he started bothering me whenever I was playing video games. He will come in the room and sort of back seat game by telling me what I should do or should have done which is very annoying and also ruins it for me because it's distracting. Even if he is quiet for like a minute its annoying having someone silently judge everything you do and makes me second guess everything I'm doing. Kind of like in school and a teacher just stops and stands over you and looks at what you're writing.

So now I've started only playing games on my steam deck or switch because then I can play in my bed or right against a wall so my brother can't look over my shoulder or I can at least move away if he tries to. He gets mad at me when I do this because he said he just wants to watch me play and it's not fair that I won't let him when he can't even play anymore. I told him he should just watch streamers play then, but he says it's not the same because he doesn't get to feel involved because they never read his comments.",FunMammoth6910,1916,325,0.9300000071525574,0.0892088346926967,1754868442,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mmxfgn/aita_for_not_playing_video_games_for_my_brother/,2025,8,AmItheAsshole,2025-08-10 23:27:22
1ml7se1,WIBTA for reporting a coworker for asking me if I was pregnant?,"My office has a front desk where our admins sit. Yesterday I got off the elevator and said ""goodmorning"" as I always do. Once I get down the hall a little I hear her say my name and turn around. She comes up to me and says ""Are you expecting?"" I tell her no I am not and walk away. 

Some other context is that this is now the 2nd time she has asked me this. The previous time was over a year ago. If she's asked me twice how many others has she asked? 

I am about 5'7 and exactly 130 pounds. I am in no way overweight. I'm a size 4 or medium in most things. I am in my late 30s and no I do not have rock hard abs or a completely flat stomach which I'm aware is incredibly offensive /s.

5 years ago I had to have a total hysterectomy and am also fully menopausal and on HRT. My husband and I did not want kids but our admin doesn't know this. I find her asking anyone if they are pregnant really inappropriate but especially in the workplace. I also (because i am not pregnant or able to get pregnant) feel like she basically just called me fat right? I don't want her asking this to others with fertility issues. What if I had just had a miscarriage, or was doing IVF? What if I had struggled with an eating disorder? Or what of my husband and I really wanted kids. That could have been a really triggering question and none if that is any of her business in the first place. 


Anyway I've been thinking about it since and it bothered me.  WIBTA if I told my boss and potentially got her in trouble? Is that not a no brainer that you don't ask a woman if she is pregnant? I feel like I'm living in a different reality. AND I know we've talked about menopause because she brought it up one day and I was telling her how much HRT had helped me.

The friend from college is a diabetic.  He has a CGM and thats how he manages it.  I honestly don't know much more about his condition and don't pry as its not my business.  He recently informed me that he is getting a service dog that alerts for his diabetes. He's supposed to get the dog next week.   

I do not want to live with a dog, I don't like them.  I told him he can break his lease for a new place but he can't have the dog in my house. Until this, it has been overall smooth sailing as roommates.  He's angry with me and supposedly looking into ways to make me accept the dog. He had a good situation at my house.

1nqetwc,AITA for refusing to have my SIL service dog at my wedding,"I once put an AITA long ago and it was super helpful, so maybe this will be helpful again. 

I’m getting married in 5 months with my fiancé. And we sent our invitations last week.

Context; my SIL (my husband’s brother’s wife) as a medical dog since she had brain cancer around 5 years ago. She has seizures where she feels dizzy 20 seconds beforehand and the goes unconscious for couple minutes. This happens 3-4 times a week. She has a dog who senses the seizure 1-2 minutes beforehand and it gives her the time to lay down in a safe place and warn people that a seizure is coming. The dog (Labrador) is an angel, but SIL, not so much. She is not a good person. She claims wrong facts about my fiancé and I’s respective fields (med and biology/environnement), and screams at us when we politely call her out. We don’t like her, but we are civil because my BIL loves her. 

My own sister on the other hand is my favourite person on earth. She is my MOH.  She is very allergic to dogs. If she’s in the same room , her eyes get red and very itchy, she sneezes constantly and she has a little asthma attack. Anti-histaminic don’t work on her. She isn’t an entitled person, prefer to “sacrifice” herself than to penalize the person with the service dog. But if in the same closed room with a dog for 5 hours, she will obviously have a strong asthma attack.

Me and my fiancé want my MOH to be comfortable in our wedding. And it’s shallow, but I want her to feel pretty in the pictures and not to have swollen red eyes. And we want our SIL to be safe, but we thought that with her husband always around her, she will have someone to lean on. We even proposed to bring a +1 to be there for her at all instants. And the venue is a 50 persons room so it’s not possible to have them separated enough and no backyard wedding in winter.

We wanted to announce those proposition face to face, but SIL cancelled our lunch together last minute and the invites needed to be sent, so we wrote her on messenger all our points and propositions. And we thought it was a good idea because it gave her the time to think and not feel pressured to answer our invites at the immediate moment (compared to a phone call or face to face)

She called me and screamed that I was ableist and an A\*\* for suggesting to remove her from her medical help, and that I want her to create a scene at our wedding and get a concussion from falling. BIL just said “what she says goes” and we don’t know what he thinks. MIL is furious and start to say she won’t come to the wedding if SIL can’t bring her dog. 

I know I’m biased because I obviously prefer my sister, and because I myself have (food) allergies and believe allergies should be accommodated in my wedding. 

What should I do? AITA. Is it a A\* move of me to suggest that?

1n607gu,AITA for refusing to reimburse my friend for a chair that broke under me?,"I (F25) was at a friend’s house for a game night this past weekend with a group of about 6. Everyone brought food and drinks and we were having a good time, when about halfway through the night I got up to use the bathroom. When I came back, I saw that one of the girls had moved from a chair to the side to my space on the couch. This didn’t bug me as people shuffle around in groups, so whatever. The chair was an antique wooden chair that sat a bit lower to the ground with an added back/butt cushion. When I sat down it immediately broke, sending me to the ground with the seat under me and the arm frames falling to the side.

Everyone got quiet for a second before jumping up to help me. I wasn’t hurt, just very embarrassed. For context I’m a bigger girl, about 260 pounds at 5 foot 7 inches. My friend (F27) was very gracious and nice about it when it happened, accepting my apologies and telling me not to worry. Her boyfriend (M29) said that the chair was his grandmother’s and it has fallen apart before and he was able to repair it. I was ushered back to the couch and game night continued.

Fast forward to the next morning, I received a text from my friend who let me know that the chair couldn’t be put back together, and that from her research it would cost about $250 to get a new one, but she’d let me know exactly how much when she found one. I was a bit taken aback, and responded confused, asking why I would be expected to pay for a faulty chair. She said that while yes, on occasion the frames would become unattached and cause it to fall apart, but that that’s not what happened this time. She sent me pictures of the broken chair, particularly a bent support and 2 other broken supports. She said that the chair broke under my weight and couldn’t be fixed, and since the chair was an antique from her boyfriend’s late grandmother, she wanted a new one for him.

I responded that the chair was very old and had a history of collapsing. If they were concerned about preserving it, they should’ve not had it out for people to use, and $250+ for a chair I sat in for 1 second seems a bit ridiculous. At this point she seemingly got frustrated, and said that she loves me but that I’m her “biggest friend” and that it wouldn’t have happened to anyone else. She said: “It broke from your weight plopping down all at once, not because the frame was loose. I think it’s only fair you reimburse us for the chair since you’re responsible for breaking it.”

I’m still figuring out how to respond. I don’t want to pay her for something I don’t see as being completely my fault. I also think she’s using the scenario to shame me about my weight a bit, which I find frustrating. My friends’ opinions are mixed. A few are saying that I should just pay her and move on, even if it’s not exactly my fault. One thinks it is my fault and I should pay up, and a few more think she’s in the wrong for asking and I should continue to politely decline.

1na8ojr,AITA for refusing to pay for our firends now broken Iphone and sunglasses that our son broke,"
I am 28F abd my husband is 32M and our son in question is 6 months old. 

When ever someone hold them we warn them, he'lll try grab you glasses or your phone, sometimes even grabs your hair.  ( we are trying to break this habit but he is 6 months) Now I warned my husband firend 33 F let's call her Jean, came to vist and want a hold which we done mind at all. I warned her about it all saying ""ohh best taking you sunglasses off your head he'll grab them. "" Now these are Gucci sunglasses costing almost 800 pounds ( which to me is crazy amount for sunglass but each ti ther own.) , she rolled her eyes at me accessed me of hogging my own baby 🤷‍♀️. I warned her again she said its fine. 

So she stood holding him. Took her phone out wanting to take a selfy, which again i am fine with as long as its not posted ( dont want pic of him online as of yet.) He of course grabbed her sunglasses got excited as he got them waved his hands about the sunglassses went flying she screamed scarying him he paniced and flailed hiting her iPhone to the floor. I quickly took him as she was freaking out.

She says I need to buy her a whole new iphone16 and replace her sunglasses or give her the money for them which is £2300.

I said ""we cant pay that as thats not even my monthly wage. Plus i am on maternity but also I dont feel like I should as you ignored my warnings"".  So called me heartless for not been more understanding of her being upset. I was more concerned with calming down my son. My husband just shrugged, telling her I did warn her.

1nhxsqd,[ Removed by moderator ],"My husband went out of the country for a business trip and returned home over the weekend. I was out of town visiting friends when he returned. His gripe was that he was left with “no food”. For context, I do the majority of the grocery shopping (~90/10) and he does his share of other chores, etc. 

I admit, there was not a refrigerator full of fresh food because I did not go to the store that week. However, I can attest there was a freezer with several meals and a pantry with food that could’ve been prepared. Perhaps not what he was hoping for, but there were some options. Also, we live in a major city with plenty of grocery stores and restaurants within walking distance. Again, not ideal after a red eye international flight, but options.

At first it wasn’t a big deal more of a joke, but when he repeatedly made jabs at me about it, I stood up for myself and now it’s a full blown argument. We are both stubborn people.

I can acknowledge that it would’ve been nice if I had stocked the fridge upon his return from the trip. However, I work a full time job myself and I see it as we are both capable adults at providing food for ourselves when the other is busy.

1n6yoez,"AITA - Adult daughter lives for free with us, wants us to pay to upgrade wifi for her","We love our daughter and we have a good relationship. She had a breakup and moved home in July temporarily (6 months? 12 months?). We are more than happy to help out and she can stay as long as she needs to, but she is complaining about our wifi coverage and how it's affecting her ability to do her job remotely. She can be pretty frugal and has asked us to pay for an extender that will cover her bedroom. We said ""no way"" after laughing a little bit.

To be fair, our AT&T wifi has always been spotty at either end of our large home, so we can understand her issue. However, she's a grown woman with a good job making good money and has significant savings. Significantly ahead of where others her age are (28 - 30). My wife and I are retired empty nesters and our wifi works perfectly well for us. She has other options to connect (plenty of room in the finished basement) but doesn't like to work there due to furniture (1 room) or lack of windows (other 2 rooms).

We can afford to do whatever we want with our house but find it off-putting that she wouldn't just buy/rent the extender and be done with it. We don't charge rent, we pay for groceries (she has dietary restrictions so she does buy some of her own as well), and we cook or provide dinner 6 days a week (she cooks one dinner a week). We believe her asking/expecting us to pay for this ""since it's your house"" is over the top. Mind you, we're also paying for a family vacation (flights, hotel, rental car, attractions/park tickets, meals) in a month. We get that children get used to parents paying for everything but this one has us alternately laughing out loud and scratching our heads.

1nn2jvb,AITA that I asked my husband if I could take a shower,"As the title says, ages have been slightly changed and some info was left out as I don't want husband to see this until I'm ready to talk about it.
 I (26F) and my husband (26M) share a baby together (6months F). There are a few things I could complain about my husband when it comes to helping me with our baby but I won't get into those as I can handle without. 
Note that this post may seem like a jab at my husband but I'm just trying ti get some non-biased opinions from people who don't know us personally, I love my husband very much.
My husband works 9 hour days, currently 6 days a week (usually 4 but his schedule has changed), each night he comes home, spends an hour (maybe 2) with our daughter, then jumps on a game. I never tell him no when playing a game as we all need down time after work. In that time, I put our child to sleep (takes 30-40 minutes), clean her toys and crawling space, wash her bottles and prepare for the night (can take upwards of an hour and a half) on top of doing cooking and cleaning every day.
Because our daughter doesn't nap long enough I can never get a shower when he's away at work. So as of currently I am showering once a week (was 3 times a week originally).
On his day off, near the end of the day after he played games for about 4-ish hours on and off, I asked him if he would mind if I took a shower. I could tell he got upset, he told his friends ""I guess we're not doing this today, maybe another day,"" his friends replied with something (I couldn't hear) and he said ""yup"" (note the tone of his voice through all of this was obviously not very happy). Once off the game he stomps away, still upset.
Now I'm waiting to go to the bathroom to shower, and I'm just wondering. AITA for asking to shower?

1nc3qqg,WIBTA If I Cancelled My Daughter’s Wedding?,"Our daughter got engaged a few months ago.  We’re very happy for her and we think her fiancé is a great guy!  

They told us the happy news and advised that they wanted to have two weddings - one here in So Cal, (where our daughter grew up and most of her family is), and one in OH, (where they currently live and where her fiancé’s family and friends are).  The two wedding plan was done primarily since both have elderly relatives who no longer travel.

We were fine with this plan, and offered to pay for the So Cal wedding entirely since it obviously accommodates our friends and family.  And hosting a wedding in So Cal is much more expensive than hosting a wedding in OH.  They told us that they would pay for half of the OH wedding and that her fiancés parents would pay for the other half.  

We discussed potential dates and venues here in So Cal with them, and got their approval before putting down any deposits.  We all agreed that the So Cal wedding would be the legal wedding, especially since it was scheduled to take place two months before the OH wedding.

Today we were informed that they intend for the OH wedding to be the legal wedding.  My husband and I were shocked as we thought this issue had been settled.  

Now we are struggling with the issue of why we are even having a So Cal wedding if it’s basically fake and not legally binding.  It’s not even like we could turn the So Cal wedding into a celebration party as they won’t yet be married by the date of the So Cal event!  

Since this is costing us a great deal of money, we are considering just cancelling the So Cal wedding.  
We just don’t see the point in spending a lot of money for a fake wedding.

WIBTA if I cancelled the So Cal wedding and we just attended the OH wedding?  We’re honestly heartbroken, but do not want to poison our relationship with our daughter or future in-laws.  

If they had come to us originally with the plan of getting married in OH, we would’ve accepted it and offered to contribute to the cost, even though it’s going to be 99% his family and friends there.

If we cancel the So Cal wedding, we will lose about 5k in deposits / sunken costs, but it would still be more palatable than 40k+ for a fake wedding.

Are we the assholes?

1numgdf,[ Removed by moderator ],"My cat Patches just turned 14 recently and was diagnosed with asthma earlier this year. I take her to the vet every few months for an antibiotic shot that seems to help her breathe better and avoid making her have to go through being on an inhaler.

Anyway, the last time I took her to the vet I had her out of the carrier in my arms. The staff was fine with this since there was no one else in the room. If a dog came in, I would put her back in and zip her up.

So, I’m waiting for the vet to come out to get us when all of a sudden the door swings open. It’s a mom and kid who is about 5. They don’t have a pet with them so I’m guessing they’re there to pick something up. Patches is startled but doesn’t go back to the carrier so I just continue holding and petting her. 

While the mom is at the counter talking to the receptionist, the kid looks my way and immediately shouts “KITTY” and starts to run over to me. That makes Patches jump back in her carrier because she doesn’t like small children because of some bad experiences when she was younger.

I’m starting to zip up the carrier when the kid tries to pet her. Without thinking, I yell out: “DON’T TOUCH HER!” The kid backs up and starts crying cause I yelled, but I’m more focused on zipping my cat in.

At this point, the mom turns around and STOMPS over to me fuming. How could I yell at her kid and make her cry, it’s just a cat, she’s only a child, I should just let her pet the cat. 

I tell the mom that her kid has no right to touch my cat, shouldn’t be running over to people’s pets and expecting to pet them without permission because that’s just asking to get a scratch or a bite mark, and she needs to teach her kid how to approach animals the right way, etc.

The mom doesn’t say anything back and just takes her crying kid and picks up her stuff and gives me a major stink face when leaving. I got through my appointment without any other interruptions and no one in reception really have any comments on it. 

I later told a friend about it and was told I was too harsh on the kid and shouldn’t have made them cry. That I could’ve approached it more delicately. I don’t think I did anything wrong because I was protecting my cat because a lot of kids don’t know how to handle and treat animals in my experience.

1nb5rou,AITA for not cleaning up sheets which have been wet by a child that’s not mine?,"My bf has a daughter (6) and we have her every other weekend. 

She’s really started testing boundaries recently and defying us, mainly me, and being generally disrespectful. It’s meant we’ve had a really hard weekend with her and we’ve had to work hard on keeping up with her attitude and behaviour around the house as we all share it and she needs to learn she doesn’t own it and that there are consequences to disrespect. 

She’s left tonight and I’ve been at work all day. Just nipped upstairs and figured I would close her bedroom door coz she’s away and we will start tidy up and washing everything later in the week. 
When I leant in to grab the door I was met with the most disgusting smell, upon further inspection she’s wet the bed. 

I also know that her wetting the bed and not telling us is another issue in and of itself so we will deal with that in our own way. 

Now I’ve not had kids of my own and even though that is definitely on the cards, I am a long way off it. I’ve made it clear to my boyfriend that there are things I will not do as I am not equipped to deal with them. And for me, cleaning this up and sorting it falls within that remit. 

He asked me to clean it, as he is gaming. I said no, and tried to explain but he cut me off and made it into a huge argument. 

I understand that I live here too but I have made it clear that I will not deal with bodily functions or fluids of any kind when it comes to her. I’m still at that point in my life where I see kids as a little gross and even though I’ve made steps, it’s not enough for this.

Instead of apologizing, he told her it didn't hurt. This isn't the first time he's been dismissive of her telling him something hurts. He's done the same to me before and it pisses me off every time.

1nffps4,AITA for making kid ‘cry’ at a bday party,"A little context: It was MY child’s birthday party, she turned 7. We invited 10 girls, all in the 7-8y age range. Next to the obvious snacks, sweets, play activities I decided to do a couple of games where kids could win prizes. We did 8 games -like Bingo, pin the broom etc.- and had 8 prizes. It was a drop off but parents were welcome to stay if they wanted. One girl -whose parent wasn’t there- was having a hard time every time she lost/didn’t win. I comforted her, all the girls did and my daughter even gave her a little toy of hers to keep. Overall, it was a fun party.

The next day I talked to the girl’s mom -who is a close friend of mine- and asked her if her daughter had a good time and if she was okay, mentioning that she had a couple of meltdowns. The mom asked me if there was a prize for every girl and I said no, just 8, for every win. But of course there were party favors at the end of the party.

The mom was a little upset but nothing too bad and I thought that was that. Then -after I cancelled a playdate- she texted me that I have made her kid upset/cry twice this week. Needless to say, she was having feelings about it. I met up with her and told her that I’m not responsible for her child’s reaction or feelings. She disagrees, it was MY choices -of not having a prize for every kid- that made her upset and that was not okay.

1nfc3kt,"AITA For Giving a student an F on homework he technically ""did""?","This happened a week ago.

I assigned homework for Thursday night into Friday to take notes. On the day of, when I'm checking homework, a student tells me he lost the paper but seemed to still want the credit. Apparently, he had taken it out to let someone else take a picture of it (cheating, didn't name the student though, but whatever) and he said he folded it and put it back into his backpack and somehow he lost it. 

He himself had a picture of it though, and it had his name on it and looked like his handwriting so i know he did it, but no physical copy = no credit. He kept trying to change my mind, saying that I email his mom and ask if he had done it (I had his brother a few years back, i know for sure his mom would NOT lie for him).

I ended up giving him an F. I'm very big on responsibility, because in real life there aren't any second chances if you mess up. The kid's mom emailed my requesting i change the grade, and i still said no. Student was pretty upset but was respectful about it. His mom certainly thinks im wrong here. 

AITA? Btw, its honors class. ",Adventurous-Eye-5951,399,1899,0.6000000238418579,0.3001243454340696,1757704582,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nfc3kt/aita_for_giving_a_student_an_f_on_homework_he/,2025,9,AmItheAsshole,2025-09-12 19:16:22

The other three are allowed.,"I have five grandsons that are all siblings, unfortunately I have told my daughter that they all can come over but one specifically is not allowed to spend the night. The reason being that I can not handle him, he is very rude and talks back and doesn’t listen or follow rules. The other 4 boys are very respectful so I don’t know where they went wrong with him. I feel like I have to constantly keep my eyes on him because he does things that I just don’t understand why someone would do that. He unlocks the front door and looks out just because he wants to. He makes a mess like you wouldn’t believe and won’t clean up after himself. My daughter has said that if he can’t stay then neither can the other boys because it’s not fair. What I don’t feel is fair is that the others can’t even have fun or do enjoyable activities bc of him. How is it fair that they miss out because he can’t behave himself. I am 62 years old and who knows how much longer I will have to enjoy them. I just feel at my age, I don’t have the ability to be up after an undisciplined child.

1nctwc2,AITA for adopting a kitten & refusing to give her back to her previous owner?,"I (21F) went to an animal shelter about 2 weeks ago and fell in love with this gorgeous 6 month old kitten, who was so friendly and needed a home. I asked the team about her history to find out why she was here and they said she was found in the road, abandoned and bitten by a dog. I immediately filled in the adoption paperwork for this kitty but she was still healing so I couldn’t take her home straight away. On Saturday she was finally spayed, microchipped and ready to come to her new home which she has slotted into perfectly. 

So tonight I received a call and message from an unknown number that says she is the owner of my kitten and she wants her back. She said she saw a post on Facebook that I had adopted her kitten and tracked me down on Instagram to find my phone number on my business’s account. She explained that she moved out of her parents’ house where the kitten lived and that she had to wait for her new landlord to tell her if she can have a kitten or not. She said the kitten kept trying to find her and one morning the kitten went outside to find and wasn’t seen again. She asked me if she can have her kitten back, she will even pay for her because she’s been looking for her for a month and sent me photos to prove it is hers. I told her that I adopted her from an animal shelter where she was recovering from a dog bite and kept in a cage and that I am NOT interested in giving her back. Am I the asshole?

1neoce6,AITAH for making my husband solo parent for 30 mins a day,"I just want to preface that my husband is aware I’m making this post. We’re not at each others throats about this, but we’re definitely not in agreement. 

So I’m 30F and he’s 34m, we have two kids, 1 and 2 years old. I work from home part time, 12pm-5:30pm Monday through Friday. I also watch our two kids. In the morning they get all my attention, and it’s not too bad, but in the afternoons after their naps when I’m trying to work, keeps them entertained and taken care of it’s quite difficult. We’re actively working on a different solution, but this is what we have to do now. My husband comes home right around 5:30 when I get off, and I immediately start getting dinner ready. I hate laundry and he hates cooking so we have an agreement that I do all the cooking and he does all the laundry and I don’t mind at all. The only thing I ask is for him to watch the kids and keep them out of the kitchen for 20-30 mins while I get dinner ready for us all. It’s always a struggle for him, and I know he’s tired after working all day too, but I really need to be able keep them out so they’re safe and I can get it done. He usually asks for help, when one is fussing or he has to go to the bathroom or whatever. Tonight, I was in the middle of cooking, hands dirty, stove and oven on, and he asked if I could help change one of the kids while he held the other cause he was being fussy. I told him no, that I do this all day by myself AND work, and all I need is 20 minutes to cook for everyone. He got really upset at this saying that’s not fair cause I am home now and I can stop for 5 minutes to help. I finally caved and helped but I feel like it’s not that much to ask for 20-30 minutes to cook. 

I want to add that any other time we’re both home we work together letting each other have breaks, time to relax, and both help play and take care of them, the care is very evenly split when we’re both home.

I said that I also wanted to be wearing green but would settle for blue since she had already decided.

They also added that people wouldn’t be able to tell who was the couple between us. I feel like it’s not that serious. We suggested other costumes (I suggested being her lady-in-waiting, but she was very against that and they suggested I be a court jester or wizard but I would really like to wear a dress/something girly).

My fiance (M30) and I (F34) have been dating for 3 years and engaged since October, 2024. We hardly ever fight, we live together and have a very solid relationship. My fiance has a best friend whom he doesn't see that often because he lives an hour away, let's call him Jack. Jack is a very reserved person and he is very sweet and he hasn't dated since my fiance and him graduated from college, so for the longest time he hasn't had a serious relationship. He met a girl via dating apps a while back and they started hitting it off. My fiance and I were very happy for him to finally date someone that he likes but this girl, lets call her Milly, is a recovering alcoholic. Milly had been in a very bad situation from a previous relationship where they were enabling each other. My fiance and I were a little worried about Jack dating Milly, since she had recently broken up with her ex. Fiance and I also thought it was good that Jack doesn't drink alcohol, he never liked it. So far, Jack has been very supportive to the point of helping her find a job after she left rehab.
The four of us went on a couple of double dates and in both cases I ended up ordering alcohol (wine) to go with my meal. Fiance was apalled I ordered alcohol. After the second double date Jack, asked my fiance in private to please not order alcohol when we go out next time. This made me feel upset, I feel like this is something I do not want to stop doing for someone else. I do enjoy grabbing a glass of wine with my food if we are going out to a nice place. I tried to compromise and said we could do breakfast instead or go to places where alcohol is not served. If Jack feels like Milly cannot be around alcohol I understand that, she has an addiction and I can only imagine how difficult it is to live in a world where things are constantly available, but I also feel like he is overstepping in telling me what I can order or not. I asked my fiance, what is going to happen when there is a gathering at our house and alcohol is served? Or when we plan our wedding? What is Jack going to do then? My fiance got upset because he says I am being stubborn and I don't want to be empathetic towards his best friend's girl. He basically thinks I am being and ass for not caring about his friend's feeling. I said fine, I will not order alcohol next time but made sure to let him know I am upset that someone else is controlling what I eat or drink. I believe that Jack won't be able to shelter Milly by controlling what other people do. Reddit, please tell me, AITA?

It's (by any measure) a minor break and it requires a (by any measure) minor surgery to fix it.

1ns60s9,[ Removed by moderator ],"My daughter (24F) is on antidepressants and lives at home rent-free while saving for her own place. She keeps her pills in her bathroom with the lid loose because it’s hard to open, and since she’s the only one using it, it’s never been a problem.

My son (23M) and his girlfriend (22F) are temporarily staying with us until their condo is ready. Their bathroom sink downstairs is small with no counterspace, so when the girlfriend wanted to dye her hair, I told her to use my daughter’s bathroom (as she has a double sink with countertops) without checking with my daughter, who was home in her room.

About an hour later, I overheard my son telling his girlfriend he didn’t know how to break something to his sister. He finally told me his girlfriend had accidentally knocked over my daughter’s pills and some fell into the sink where she was dying her hair. I said I’d talk to my daughter, but my son insisted. I heard him enter her room with an attitude, saying, “Don’t start acting like an ass, but \[girlfriend\] knocked your pills into the sink.”

My daughter was furious, grabbed the remaining pills, and stormed off. My son blamed her for leaving the lid loose. When she asked why they were even in her bathroom, I explained, and she got angrier, saying they could have used theirs or mine. I told her I hadn’t expected this and she needed to calm down. She called my son an asshole and shut herself in her room.

I urged my son and his girlfriend to apologize, her because she should have asked to move the pills, and him because he escalated the situation. He eventually cooled down and apologized, but his girlfriend refused. My son then demanded my daughter apologize to his girlfriend. My daughter refused, saying she had nothing to be sorry for. The girlfriend chose to stay elsewhere until their condo is ready. My daughter spoke with her psychiatrist and replaced her medication.

My son still insists I should make my daughter apologize. I did tell my daughter she could have reacted more calmly, but she maintains that they should have asked her to move the pills or at least approached her without assuming she’d “go crazy.” She also points out she never said anything to the girlfriend, only her brother, and that I never should have let them use her bathroom in the first place.

So…have I completely mishandled this?

About once a month I tell my boyfriend to invite them over for dinner. Usually I cook, clean the table and do the dishes. It’s a labour of love and I enjoy doing it. This tradition has been going on for years. Most of them put away their dishes in the dishwasher but I do the bulk of the work.

Now, David (BF) is closest with Mark (M25). About a month ago Mark broke up with his GF and he has been hanging out at our place almost everyday. We all work from home so he just shows up in the morning. I don’t mind this either, David asked me if it was alright. 

What I mind is that Mark is a freaking slob. Multiple coffee mugs all over the house, water cups, crumbs on the counter, dirty dishes. Even his dirty socks once.. I made several comments to Mark that this is not dinner night and he if he is going to be over so much, he is not going to be treated as a guest and he needs to learn to clean after himself. He only rolled his eyes at me. I told David two weeks ago that Mark needs to learn to pick after himself. They had a talk and Mark did make an effort for a few days but we are back at square one.

David saw me getting frustrated so now Mark comes over once a week and David is quick to clean up after him.

It still bugs me the wrong way so yesterday when I felt like having people over for dinner I invited everyone but Mark. David did not ask why, maybe he figured it out, idk. Mark came to pick something today and asked me why he wasn’t invited and I told him. He was surprised and called me petty, and said that it was unfair to be singled out over a dirty mug. I told him that unless he changes I am not cooking for him. He is welcome to come over and have David wait on him but not me.

I don’t know if it is important but the house is David’s, but we live together.

He got upset, called me an a-hole and left. Did I overreact? I can’t tell at this point. 


Edit: to add since a lot of people think I am cosplaying a trad wife, consider that:

-I’ve known these people for 6 years, they are my friends at this point

-my own friends have serious food allergies, so anything out of my kitchen is inedible to two of them, which makes for a crappy dinner invitation

-I WANT to do this, no one is making me, no one is forcing me to slave in the kitchen. My cooking is a hobby, I am more than happy to share it with people.

1n64krd,AITA for telling my sister she can't play with my girlfriends wigs?,"Okay so, context. I, (26M) have been with my girlfriend who i'll call Maddy (also 26F) for five years now. I also have a sister who's still in high school (16). Whilst we have a huge age gap I love my sister. I'm afraid I spoiled her a bit growing up but yeah i'm her big bro, that’s pretty normal.

Anyway, Maddy found out in 2023 that she has alopecia universalis. Her hair started falling out pretty dramatically since she had long hair, and she was really embarrassed. I know some assholes care about the vain stuff like that but I don't, i’m not a saint just a normal guy, but I saw it embarrassed her so in the autumn we both buzzed our hair together. Pretty soon after she started buying some normal and real hair wigs to test them out, and loved them. They are not cheap by any means but she feels confident with them so it doesn't matter to me. Maddy has met my sister, who i'll call Helena, a lot. She always wants Maddy to either take it off and show her head or give it to her. She even tugged at it once (it's glued on so didn't budge) and was mad it didn't come off. I got mad but Maddy laughed it off, not wanting to cause a scene.

We saved up and went away to this nice hotel on a Greek island, and got my sister to 'flat-sit' when we were on holiday for some extra cash. Half-way through the trip I got tiktoks of my sisters and her friends in OUR ROOM wearing some of her wigs and lip-syncing some audio off of dance moms. I was pissed, admittedly first because they were in our locked room, but then because of the wigs. I saw they cut one of the very expensive blonde wigs into a short pixie. I showed Maddy, she seemed shocked but brushed it off, saying it was fine and she'll get more. I texted her to stop, and if I catch her doing it again she'll pay for a new one. She ‘apologised’, said they were just having fun but they'll stop.

Nothing else happened so we forgot about it until we got back. We reached our room, she opened the cupboard to where she keeps her wigs and they were haphazardly shoved in, cut, and some of them dyed. I was shocked. One of her wigs had been badly bleached, then dyed pink and was practically hay. I was beyond pissed off. I was beyond furious. I immediately call her, and she doesn't answer, so I call our mom. I tell her what Helena did, chewing her out. Telling her she was disrespectful to Maddy and she needs to learn how to respect other people.

1nlasrp,[ Removed by moderator ],"Tiny bit of background: I am physically disabled. I walk with a slight limp, use crutches and braces many days, have some substantial scars (although often covered by my clothes), etc. Most days a stranger could see that I am different, but may not really know what is so different about me. 

A couple semesters ago I was taking a required class in college and discovered it was basically Woodshop class… which is not easy when I am using crutches and such. I got to know the professor pretty well and he was amazingly accommodating and ended up making a lot of changes to the shop to accommodate me. 

He reached out to me a while ago and explained that he was teaching a class that focused on designing for clients and wondered if I was willing to come in and speak about my experiences being disabled and then serve as the client. I am a huge fan of advocating through sharing stories so I agreed pretty quickly. 

I went in, and spoke about my day-to-day experiences. The tiny bits of inaccessibility on campus that add up for me, the way I’m treated by others, etc. I was focusing on how my disability affects my life rather than what my disabilities are, so, notably, I didn’t give my diagnoses. Then I met with each group of students and talked about what they could design to help me. The point was for them to notice a challenge and offer a solution.

I was meeting with one group and one of the students asked me what my diagnosis was. I said, “well I have a few, but I prefer not to share them as that is personal medical information.” The student kind of rolled his eyes and said something along the lines of “well how am I supposed to design something for you if I don’t know what’s wrong with you.” This, obviously took me back, and frankly stung a little bit.

Is it wrong for me to share about my experiences without sharing my diagnoses? I can see how my words can mean less if people don’t know the name of “what’s wrong with me” but it felt like this was supposed to be more about my experiences than the disabilities themselves. I’m feeling torn.

p.s, if it matters. I generally don’t share diagnoses because I have had a couple bad experiences with people googling the diagnosis and thinking they have a full understanding of me and my life then start making assumptions about me.",Glittering_Shame59,3741,255,0.9700000286102296,0.2185751727477501,1758305018,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nlasrp/aita_for_not_sharing_my_specific_diagnosis/,2025,9,AmItheAsshole,2025-09-19 18:03:38
1ndu7zz,AITA for telling my brother he can’t bring his dog on our family weekend away?,"I'm 39M and I'm starting to think I have started a family argument over what I thought was a simple request.

My brother (37) is obsessed with his Labrador, but I told him his lab can't come on a weekend getaway 

Now my brother is threatening to skip the trip and the family is divided. AITA?

My wife and I had planned an anniversary treat for my parents as they were celebrating their 50th. We booked a country house that could accommodate me, my wife, 2 kids, parents, brother, his wife and kid.

We also booked a private chef for one night.

The house has a no pets rule. The chef also needs to be free of pets whilst setting up and cooking. I thought this would be fine by everyone.

My bro has always been glued to his lab taking her everywhere. When I told my brother about the rules he got upset and said his lab was like a daughter so should be there. To try and accommodate her he suggested leaving the dog in the car whilst the chef was there and said no one would ever find out.

I tried to shut this down by saying it was against the rules and I don't want his dog barking or running loose whilst we are trying to relax with the kids. My youngest is also a bit fearful of dogs and pet hair can be a bit of a trigger for their asthma.

Things got a bit heated and my brother said he'd bring the dog anyway

I lost it a bit and said if you can't do this for a special occasion then maybe you should stay home.

He stormed off, and he’s now told our parents he’s not coming unless the dogs allowed. Mom says I’m being too harsh and should “work it out” with the house owner and make arrangements with the chef. Dad thinks he's being a bit of a brat and it’s my call since I’m paying for it.

I feel bad because me and my bro usually get along great, and I want him there for Mom and Dad. I even offered to cover a dog sitter or a kennels for the weekend, but he called that “offensive” and said the dog isn’t “just a pet.”

1nb3xcj,AITA for leaving my sister’s wedding early after she made a “joke” about my job in her speech?,"I (18M) just graduated from high school and I have been working part time as a busser at a restaurant. It is not a glamorous job but it's super chill and honestly, I kind of love it. I'm saving money for school, I get along with my coworkers, it's honest work. I guess my family likes to tease me about it sometimes, but whatever.  
  
My older sister (25F) got married over the weekend. During her reception speech, she did this whole thing thanking everyone. Then she looks at me and says, ""And thanks to (my name) for leaving the dishes behind to bless us with his presence.""  
  
Everyone laughed ... I didn't. I was mortified; it was so embarrassing and I chould tell everyone was looking at me, especially all of her friends and my whole extended, loud family. I have been insecure enough about not having a ""real"" job yet compared to my cousins, etc.   
  
I tried to brush it off, but my parents kept teasing me about it at dinner. I don't know, it just felt like the whole wedding was ruined for me. After about 30 minutes, I quietly got up and left and went home. I did not make a scene or a fuss.  
  
  
Now my sister is upset, saying I ""ruined her wedding by storming off early and that it was just a joke. My parents are upset as well, saying I embarrassed her by being ""sensitive."" But my friends are saying she was out of line and I was absolutely in the right to get angry.

1nb58ju,AITA for kicking my husband and MIL out?,"I gave birth two months ago, and my MIL flew in from England to “help.” I never asked her to, she bought the tickets before asking, so I felt forced to agree. She has been helpful with making dinner but refuses to help with the baby at night or pick up around the house, which is what I really need help with. I end up cleaning up after her because she cooks but refuses to do the dishes, and constantly complains every time I turn on the garbage disposal. For two weeks, it’s been nonstop complaints about America: the food, the people being “fake,” the weather, etc. At first I ignored it, but lately her comments have turned personal.

Example: after she got her hair done a few days ago, I told her she looked amazing. She rolled her eyes and said, “Amazing? Really? Why is everyone here so fake? Even my own mum didn’t say that on my wedding day.”

Another time, I praised the roast dinner she made (after skipping lunch because of baby cluster feeding). I said, “Oh my god, this is so good,” and she and my husband looked at each other and laughed, then made comments about how “umm yeah it’s good, but who reacts like that to food?” I kept my irritation to myself and stayed quiet. I went to bed right after and didn’t even talk to both of them, they were up for hours drinking wine and watching a movie while my daughter kept waking up every hour to feed, and they refused to turn the tv down so I could sleep in between feeding. 

But this morning was the breaking point. While breastfeeding, I told my baby (as I always do) that she’s beautiful, amazing, and loved, and she’ll have so much fun when she starts running, describing her facial features and how they’re so pretty. MIL overheard and said, “Oh no, you’re not turning that poor girl into a fake bimbo too, are you?”

That made me see red. I told her she’s been mocking and disrespecting me in my own home, and she’s not welcome anymore. I told her to go to a hotel because I don’t want that negativity around my daughter.

My husband blew up, said I’m “hormonal,” ungrateful, and overreacting. He said his mom isn’t leaving and that I should be thankful for her help (help I never asked for and she doesn’t give anyway). I told him he could leave with her. It escalated, and I had my uncle come handle it because I didn’t want them near me. The house that we live in was inherited from my parents when they passed, so it hurt even more that they’re disrespecting me in MY home, my safe space. 

They go out to eat together but tell me not to come because “the baby doesn’t have an immune system yet.” When I walk into a room, they look at each other and laugh but won’t say why.

Now my husband has me blocked, idk where we’re gonna go from here. 

AITA for kicking them out? Did I overreact?

1n9dh9i,AITA telling my family my sister couldn't work with me because of them?,"I (28F), run my own business as a seamstress selling clothes I've made as well as doing alterations.  I've been open for two years, and I do a steady business and my primary income from my business is the alterations I do.  I have a sister (29F), who we'll call Lana.  Lana is currently a recovering alcoholic and I'm trying my best to support her.  Due to DUIs, she has been struggling to find a job and her mental health isn't helping her keep any job she finds.  I feel really bad for her and while we were visiting my parents on Monday, I made the offer she could work for me.  When I made the offer, I said that she could work inventory and register like a normal employee.  She seemed pretty on board but said she would have to think about it since she didn't want to leech off me.  Our parents were also really on board and encouraging and thought this would be a great opportunity for both of us.  Wednesday, my mom called me and asked if the building would now be in both Lana and I's names.  I asked her what she meant and she said since Lana is co-owner her name should be on the lease. I told her it wouldn't, because she wouldn't be co-owner. I made it clear to my mother that Lana would be like any other employee, the reason I wanted her to work with me is so if she relapsed, she wouldn't risk losing her job again since I know what's she's going through.  Mom beat around the bush trying to convince me to make Lana co-owner and I repeatedly told her no, not only for Lana's sake but also the sake of my business.  I don't think Lana would be a bad co-owner, but at this time, she's still fairly unstable and I don't want her to get stressed and fully break her sobriety.  I made this clear to my mother in our phone call before she eventually gave up.  I thought that was the end of it, and few hours Lana called to ask if I hired her what she would be doing, I told her the same thing I said at dinner that she would mostly be doing inventory, register, etc.  She asked if she would help with any of the clothes and I told her when she learned to sew I would consider it.  She accepted and seemed excited with the arrangement since both of us have always loved fashion and we agreed I would host an interview with her at the end of next week on my day off.  My dad called me yesterday scolding me about the position I was putting Lana in and was telling me a meaner version of what my mother was saying and continuously trying to hound me to give Lana a higher position.  I was getting really frustrated and I told him that if he and mom wouldn't stop pushing, I just wouldn't hire Lana at all.  My dad called me a terrible sister before hanging up.  I called Lana and told her what happened and my words about not hiring her, she got upset with me and I apologized and told her I still wanted her to work with me, I just didn't want to drama with mom and dad.  She understood but is still upset with me I would even say that even in the heat of the moment.

I rent a comfy studio, have regular clients, and honestly I work really hard to keep the business moving . It’s my full-time job, not just a side hustle, and it pays my bills.

This weekend, my sister and her husband came over for dinner. At some point, my brother-in-law casually asked , “Man, I’ve been so sore lately. Can you just give me a quick massage while we’re here?”

I kind of laughed it off and said, that’s what I do all week  you can book a session with me if you want though!”

He looked offended and said he thought family should get freebies. My sister chimed in and said Yeah, come on, you can’t just do a 20 minutes back rub for him? It won’t cost you anything.

I told them it does cost me time, energy, and the skills I spent years training for. If I start giving away free massages every time someone in the family feels sore, I’d basically be working for free half the time.

They got kind of grumpy about it and said I was being stingy, that it’s just a massage and I “should want to help family.”

Now I’m feeling weird because I don’t want to be selfish, but I also don’t think it’s fair to expect me to work for free just because I own the business.

1n8jkb6,AITA--I refuse to pick up my mother from the hospital,"My mother, 73, had a stroke 6 weeks ago, on July 13.  I don't live with them, I live around 20 minutes drive away. The night she had the stroke, she fell out of bed.  My stepdad couldn't get her off the floor so he called my 43 year old brother from the backyard camper where he lives and the two of them struggled for an hour to get her back into bed.  They didn't call 911.  The next day I received a call around noon that ""something is wrong with Mom"".  I came over and realized she had probably had a stroke and got her to the hospital.  She had a massive stroke and because of their negligence, and waiting 12 hours to get her help, she is now half blind and can't walk without a walker.  I spent a week with her at the hospital in ICU, doing everything possible to help her.  She was discharged and went to an acute rehab for 2 weeks, and was discharged August 2nd to home.  My mother and stepdad and brother are all hoarders and their house is filthy and invested with rats.  I spent a week with a dumpster and hired help cleaning out her house so she could even get in the front door with her walker or wheelchair.  I organized the GoFundMe, cleaned the filthy house, hired the exterminator, assembled all of her medical equipment, and basically wore myself to the bone to make her home safe for her so she could come home.  My brother has done nothing to help and has left her alone in the house for hours knowing full well she needs 24/7 care.  She has fallen twice on his ""watch"". She is back in the hospital due to another suspected stroke.  I have told my family I am not picking her up from the hospital.  She has to go a nursing home and I have to sell the house to pay for it.  I told my loser brother to get out.  I will let the state take her to a nursing home. I literally give up.

1nn7br5,"AITA for ""using my disablity to control my group""?","So I(20F) have a brain condition, joint disorder and several other medical issues. The main thing in this story is that my brain condition causes migranes, vertigo episodes, etc. 

I've had the same group of friends since middle school. There's 6 of us, all within the ages of 19-23. And we are all diverce in intrests, styles, etc. One of my friends, D, loves punk concerts. She posts flyers for local house concerts. Now I can't go to house concerts(most aren't wheelchair accessible, they are too loud even with noise canceling headphones, etc) so I always tell everyone to go have fun. It isn't their fault I'm disabled 💀 and I'm not the type to be like ""If I can't go, NO ONE can"". 

There's another girl in the group, W, who tries to be like, my advocater and says, ""Oh maybe we should choose something OP can do"" to which I say again, I do not mind. At all. Hell, I love sitting at home. I got my dogs, videos games and I'm good, plus they get me extra merch from the shows which is cool af.  I never asked W to be my advocate.

Now, like 2 days ago, D posted another concert thing in our group chat. W again said, ""That isn't very accessible, we shouldn't go."" 

D BLEW tf up saying how ""W and OP are always trying to control the group and just because youin a wheelchair doesn't mean you get to dictate what the group was doing and how OP must be pming W to stand up for me all the time"". To which, I haven't. Ngl, I'm not close with W. She's one of our other friend's close friends so she's always at our hangouts. 2 other people kinda agreed with D that W shouldn't be commenting on if something is wheelchair accessible all the time. 

I said that I don't care if they go to the concerts, It isn't my thing anyway and I won't feel left out. I'm good and D tried to say I was probably trying to find a way out of them being pissed off at me and D has pretty much went silent within the group chat which is weird since we've talked everyday in it since sophomore year of high school. 

Idk, AITA?

1ndpjjo,"AITA I made my sculpture ""wrong"" so I walked out of class.","I'm primarily a textile artist. I'm technically getting a degree in sculpture, but only because my university merged the degree programs, I already hold a degree in ceramic sculpture and have been teaching on and off for the past six years. My instructor for this class is a grad student, the class is teaching wood and metalworking. Hopefully this is enough context? I am also trans and autistic.

Our first assignment is to make a reliquary for an object out of wood. That's the entire prompt, no constraints given other than it must be made out of the provided (compressed sawdust) wood panel. Since this isn't my first rodeo, I'm pushing myself to test the boundaries of sculpture and how I and the viewer interact with it. My immediate thought was creating a sculpture with the intent on burning it and the object it holds. A phoenix works perfectly. I knew I couldn't burn it in class, but I was given the okay to present it, then record the burning and upload it onto our class discussion board. 

I created the prototype over the weekend out of cardboard. Because the wood could not be carved, I was going to layer pieces in a similar way to the cardboard and have the wings attached by hinges. The phoenix would hold my old passport in it's beak. Burning the sculpture represents me leaving my old life behind in multiple ways: through me being trans, attempting to move countries, and my artistic voice changing and developing. 

I present my prototype, get good feedback, and get to work sketching onto the wooden panel. My instructor then comes up and implies I am doing the assignment incorrectly and will get a lowered grade. He questioned why it wasn't 3D (it is, the wood is layered), why a passport instead of something from my childhood, and where the baby was???? Like how would I have a new one come out of the ashes... The phoenix is representative of my old self, I am the new. I don't understand how he couldn't see this, we spent a good five minutes on just that point.

He finally leaves me so I can continue my work, but most of the class is over at that point. Jump to today, I'm finalizing my sketch and marking cuts. He comes back and starts questioning again why it's a relief and not a sculpture (a relief IS a sculpture) and, at this point, I'm frustrated and done answering questions. Again, we were not given any constraints or instructions other than ""reliquary."" I defend my work again and then we just.... stare at each other. He wouldn't leave so I gathered my stuff and left the class, dropping it a few minutes after. 

I'm probably in the wrong, but this isn't my first time making a sculpture. I know what I want to say and I don't want to compromise that by changing things simply for a grade. I'm planning on transferring to a weaving specific school anyways, so it's not like this will ruin my degree, either. Maybe it's an autistic misunderstanding, but if you wanted me to make a specific sculpture, then tell me that or let me use different materials.",FrostyFreeze_,2148,534,0.8600000143051147,0.1828191039475664,1757536520,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ndpjjo/aita_i_made_my_sculpture_wrong_so_i_walked_out_of/,2025,9,AmItheAsshole,2025-09-10 20:35:20
1ng6e3h,AITA for forcing my husband to close his business?,"My husband and I (both 30) have been married for 7 years. When we were dating, he had always expressed his dream of starting his own business and he is an entrepreneur at heart. At age 27, he quit his well-paying job to start his own business -- a fitness studio. 

I find it risky and scary, but supported him nonetheless because it’s his dream. We could also afford starting a business because I make 130k and have an inheritance from my mother who passed away.

Besides monetary support, I also helped with renovation, building equipment, contacting clients, and advertising. I manned the front desk from time to time.

Three years later, his business had lost 200k, which I paid for entirely using my inheritance. All the money he made from the business stayed in the business to pay for expenses, so I also paid 100% of our housing, transportation, food, and entertainment.

My resentment was growing, and I was tired of being the sole provider. I feel he made many wasteful purchases, such as very expensive marketing services that brought in nearly no revenue.

From my husband’s point of view, he was working hard every day for our future. Despite the loss, he was making calculated bets. He believes that “scared money don’t make money”. There’s no need for me to stress because “we are not hurting for money,” given my income and inheritance.

He finds his business a tremendous source of pride and joy, seeing many clients who love the gym and continue to come back. He made friends with his coaches and clients. The gym is his sanctuary.

Five months ago, we agreed that I will no longer chip in anymore for the business. He would find a job so that he can start contributing to the family, and he will use his income to support his business.

Fast forward to today, he hasn’t found a job yet. He also maxed out the business credit card and now the business is 40k in debt. I was furious. Finally, I requested that he must close his business within a month or two, and this is only way that he will start looking for a job seriously. AITA for forcing my husband to close his business?

I love it here. They have a lot of activities after class and 6th grade was the first time since 2nd grade that I didn’t fail even though I knew the material. I also have friends here even tho I had a hard time making friends at home and I have therapy and group here. 

When my parents divorced my mom asked me to tell my dad and his lawyer that I don’t wanna go to boarding school anymore and I want to live with her because she signed a prenup so she doesn’t get the house or money and the only way she can get money is if I live with her. 

I told her I didn’t want to live with her because I really wanted to go to this school and she moved without me and she doesn’t visit or call and she doesn’t answer when my dad asks about me visiting. 

My dad got an apartment near my school so he can visit on weekends. If he can’t visit my old nanny comes up to see me. 

My mom called me and said she can’t live with her sister anymore so she wants me to ask my dad if she can use the apartment and I can stay with her and only be enrolled for the day school. I said no I like living here so she said I can still live here but I can see her on the weekends. I told her my dad uses the apartment to see me on the weekends and I don’t wanna stop seeing him. Now she’s mad at me and she’s back to not talking to me. AITA for not asking my dad to let her use the apartment?",NoCheesecake5005,3020,245,0.959999978542328,0.1822384591885067,1758405231,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nmapih/aita_for_not_asking_my_dad_to_let_my_mom_use_his/,2025,9,AmItheAsshole,2025-09-20 21:53:51
1nsx0d6,[ Removed by moderator ],"I (f31) like ""witchy"" things. Tarot cards, I make my own herbal tinctures (I am fully vaccinated and believe in science just getting that in), crystals etc. That being said, I consult tarot cards for fun. If I'm being audited by the IRS, I'm consulting an accountant, not tarot. My wife (38) had a lump on her breast last spring, and I made her a doctors appointment, didn't consult tarot. (Was benign, thank goodness). The most extreme I get would be having a run of the mill bad day, consulting tarot and using that to help inform what I might do next, like take a long bath or something. 

I have a friend, Grace (30's) who is in legal trouble. I don't know if I can say here without breaking rules, but her thing isn't a speeding ticket that you want to contest and show up in court for. This is a situation where she needs to hire her own lawyer and probably be prepared for some serious consequences. 

Anyways, she asked me if I could read her tarot to see the outcomes of the situation, and I refused. A) because she hasn't done anything yet. Her court day is approaching and as far as I know, she still doesn't have legal representation, and B) tarot cards might give a ""it's fine!"" answer but a judge and jury in Massachusetts are going to decide on their own. I told her no, she should really find a lawyer. Grace got really upset, saying this would help her know what to expect and put her mind at ease, and that I wasn't being a good friend. 

I think a good friend sometimes has to give their friends hard truths, but tarot doesn't always take long, and it could make her feel better. AITA? 

EDIT- I just got like, 7 inbox requests for tarot readings. I'm not doing that. Also, to answer some questions, I use tarot as a soothing tool, an advice tool, and yes, for fun. I find it helps me think things through more. It's more than a party game to me but it's not life and death.

1n8ow1d,AITA for refusing to Venmo my roommate’s mom for cooking us dinner?," 
I  live with three other guys in an off-campus apartment. Last weekend, one of my roommate’s moms came over and cooked this big homemade dinner for all of us. I thought it was really nice of her, I helped set the table, washed the dishes afterward, and even grabbed some drinks for everyone.

The next day, my roommate texted in the group chat saying: “Hey, my mom spent like \$80 on groceries for last night’s dinner. Can everyone Venmo her \$20 to help cover it?”

I was honestly confused. None of us were told in advance that we’d be expected to chip in. Whenever my parents visit, they bring food or cook for everyone, and it’s always just a gesture ,not something they charge for. I told him I appreciated his mom cooking, but I didn’t think it was fair to be asked to pay afterward without knowing.

Now he’s upset and says I’m ungrateful and disrespectful, and the other two roommates already Venmoed her without complaint. So now I look like the only cheapskate.

From my perspective, it feels wrong to turn a mom’s dinner into a bill. But maybe I’m missing something and I actually am being stingy.",MiniPataka,1659,467,0.949999988079071,0.149269330797406,1757026628,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1n8ow1d/aita_for_refusing_to_venmo_my_roommates_mom_for/,2025,9,AmItheAsshole,2025-09-04 22:57:08
1nqhhuf,[ Removed by moderator ],"My wife is obsessed with Stanley cups. She owns at least two dozen, probably more. She uses three cups a day. Her morning coffee goes in one, a flavored water goes in the second, and then a third goes with her to work empty so she can put whatever else she wants in there that day. For the last couple of years, I've put up with it. We've been married 9 years and the only assigned chores are that I do the lawn care and the garbage (smell of garbage can make her vomit). We equally cook and clean and do laundry and anything else that needs to be done whenever we see it needs to be done. 

Chores have never been a point of contention until March of this year. I took a lateral position that changed my work style significantly. I now work from home four days a week with the fifth being a half day split between two offices. I'm home by 3:00 on those days. So because of that, I've taken on way more of the chores. I'm not complaining about most of it because I can do it and my life is much easier than it was before. The problem is my wife's habits. Because her office is so remote, lunch options are limited, so she tends to take all the leftovers from dinner. The issue is that she will leave the dirty, unrinsed containers in her car for days at a time and then just stack them up in the sink for me to deal with. Between the insanely bad smell and filling up the bottom drawer of the dishwasher every few days with Stanleys, I'm over it. In addition to the numerous cups, she also expects the matching lid and straw to be reassembled before storage. 

  
I told her that if she wants to continue ignoring my requests to bring her containers in every day, or to at least rinse them out at work, then she has to do the dishes from now on. Now, according to her, I'm being unreasonable. Because I'm home and don't have any commute time, I have way more free time than she does, and so I should take on the majority of the chores. But from my view, I've done exactly that. Since the change, I do nearly everything. Vacuuming, mopping, cleaning/folding/storing clothes, grass, garbage, and most of the cooking. I don't think it's particularly fair to expect me to also deal with her stinky tupperware and mountain of cups along with the sorting of the accessories after.

1nkmgz3,[ Removed by moderator ],"I’ll try to give pertinent background info, but condense it.

My ex-wife (51F) and I (50M) were married 18 years, right out of college. We had a good, functional and loving marriage, but in the end, she decided it wasn’t for her and we amicably divorced.  We had 2 kids, 18F and 19M.

6 months later I met my current wife (47F) and her son (19M). We’ve now been married 8 years. She had a very tumultuous and abusive relationship with her ex. It’s still volatile and she hates him…only dealing with him when needed.

My ex and I have a great co-parenting relationship and are friends. We only talk about kid related things, except at kid related events where we make small talk. We don’t communicate much outside of that.

My current wife and ex were pleasant and professional for awhile.

Several years ago, I was venting about my ex traveling a lot for work and having to pick up extra slack a little. Mind you, this was just venting, and I honestly love any extra time I get with the kids. Well, my current wife decided to text my ex-wife, basically calling her out as a bad mom, and telling her to pick up the slack. I didn’t really feel that way and felt it was out of place for her to do that.

Since then, the “relationship” between current and ex wife has not been good and basically irreparable.  They’re professional, but my current wife hates my ex, with very little cause in my book. We had to sit separately for my son’s graduation 2 years ago, but sat together this year for my daughter’s graduation

When it came time to move my daughter in to college, I did not want that tension to “ruin” my daughter’s bonding moment with her mom.  College move in day can be very emotional. I asked my daughter about my wife coming to move in, and she said “it might be too many people”. Granted, I admit that the way I asked the question was a little leading, but the tension between my ex and current wife is well known in the family.  My wife wasn’t invited to move in and my ex and I moved my daughter in…separate cars, and only for a few hours. We did the same thing for our son last year…my wife didn’t go because she was working.

My current wife was livid, and weeks later it’s still a sore spot and led to another blowup last night, somewhat related to this.

I admitted to my wife that it was a mistake and apologized.

1ntrysk,[ Removed by moderator ],"So I'll begin like this I’m Kayla and my friend Kate lives in a studio that’s pretty cramped up. Two months ago she asked if she could keep two small boxes of her winter clothes at my place since I have a two bedroom and more space. I didn’t see the harm at the time  and agreed.



But those  “two small boxes” turned into bags, then shoes, then coats, and what not,  She now has about 6 large bags and two bins stacked in my spare room. I told her it’s starting to overwhelm my space and making me feel uncomfortable , especially because I actually use that room for work and studying basically.



When I asked her to either pick up her stuff or pay me part of the rent I pay (like $30 monthly, which is less than a storage space), she got mad. She said I was being greedy, that “friends don’t charge each other for favors,” she also accused me of acting like a landlord in my own house.



From my point of view, it’s not just about money   it’s about my home. I feel like I can’t have guests over without explaining why I’m storing half her wardrobe. I’ve also had to move her stuff around multiple times just to use my desk for work.



Some mutual friends are saying I’m right for setting boundaries, but others think I’m being petty and making a big deal out of something that’s been hurting me so bad.

1no0b2h,[ Removed by moderator ],"In case you don't know what spirit week is, it is a week where each day is a themed ""dress-up"" day for school. My younger sister (12), wanted to borrow my Nirvana shirt because tomorrow is ""Rapper"" day. She said she wanted to borrow my Nirvana shirt because it's ""gangsta"" and ""looks like it's from the hood"". I then educated her on how Kurt Cobain and Nirvana was not ""gangster"" and how disrespectful that was, her response being ""I don't give a fuck"" and ""just give me the shirt"". I offered an actual rap shirt (Public Enemy), but she started crying because i didn't give her the shirt and she stormed out of my room. I then got scolded by my parents for not giving my sister the shirt, and I was forced to give my shirt to her. Is it that deep, or AITA?

Mini Update: Hasn't gone to school yet, but I just found out that it isn't Rapper day. It is rhyming day, and you have to rhyme with someone elses outfit. Which means that she specifically chose to be a rapper, and then come to me not only asking for sunglasses (which I gave her) but also asking for a Nirvana shirt.

Update: She apologized to me after getting home. Apparently a group of like 3 boys in her grade kept making fun of her, and a bunch of other people made comments in the hallway passing her. She apologized for not listening to me, and she apologized for STAINING MY SHIRT WITH ICECREAM. Hopefully it comes off in the wash though. Safe to say she is never borrowing my clothes again. I think I'm pretty much done with this story, but apparently I should come to this subreddit more when my sister does crazy over-the-top things. Thank you all so much for the comments and feedback!

P.S: She rhymed with her friend who dressed as a ""Napper"".

1nsyaph,[ Removed by moderator ],"I (21F) moved back home with my parents after being diagnosed with cancer last year (in remission now). I decided to stay home to attend community college since I don’t have enough money saved to move back to university.

This month, I finally got my college refund disbursed. I was planning to use my refund to catch up on my student loans from the previous university I attended since my cancer treatment deferment was ending soon. Two days after I received my refund, I went to go check how much money I can use for my loan. I noticed that $500 from my account was missing and transferred to my mom’s bank account (I have a joint bank account with my mom since it was made when I was a minor, I didn’t mind her having access since she said it was a good idea for her to see my account for emergencies).

I was confused and woke up my mom in the middle of the night to ask her why she removed $500 from my account. She said that she removed it because she thought it was a “final computation” or an extra refund from another class from my old university that my dad helped pay for (Context: I didn’t receive aid for a summer class I took last year in my previous school since I didn’t take enough units to qualify. I originally was enrolled in enough classes to qualify for aid, but had to drop them since I had to immediately get treatment for cancer). I was extremely confused because my dad let me use his card, then why would she think that a refund would go back into my bank account? Then, when I kept asking for an explanation, she said “I thought you would’ve noticed that your money is gone because I saw that you spent $5 at this store and $20 at another store, don’t you check your money before you buy anything?” and “I told your dad that I removed the $500 from your account because I thought it was an extra refund from your class”. I ended up yelling at her to put the money back in my account, that she can’t just remove it without saying or clarifying anything first, and wouldn’t stop until she gave me the money back. Even then, I just kept yelling at her out of frustration since I couldn’t understand why she thought she could remove it because the bank statement says that my refund came from my community college, not from the other university I attended. I was just so mad because she spent two days relying on me finding out by just checking my phone to see how much money I had. 

The second she saw me the next morning, she started yelling at me for waking her up just for a “small amount of money” and that I “should’ve asked her nicely” for her to give my money back. I honestly don’t know how to react at this point. AITA?

Edit:

I wanted to clarify that the refund I received is the leftover grant money from community college. I did not pull out any student loans this year.

I am also considered an inactive student by my previous university since I was gone for a complete school year. I didn’t qualify to pull out a student loan or receive financial aid specifically during the summer of 2024, which was when I took the class my Dad helped pay for. My university already clarified to me that there was no extra loan or grant money was expected to be disbursed for that summer.

Every refund that I have ever received was always disbursed within the first two weeks of the same quarter. If I did receive one, I would’ve received a notification that it was being disbursed and it wouldn’t have taken a year for my university to give me a refund.",rambutanorangutan,1826,290,0.959999978542328,0.1311675166564654,1759090227,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nsyaph/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_after_she_removed_my/,2025,9,AmItheAsshole,2025-09-28 20:10:27
