16glz0r,CMV: The right wing's obsession with trans issues is largely because they have nothing else to talk about.,"I'll be honest. I don't know what the hell is going on with the whole trans thing. I think having a thousand genders is silly and alot of the pronoun stuff also seems weird. 

But I just don't notice it in daily life (and I live in a very liberal city). Trans folk are such a small part of the population, but you would think that there's one in every neighborhood, just waiting to break in and mutilate your family's genitals, considering how the right wing talks about this issue online.

I'm sure that there are many who would genuinely take issue with this stuff anyways, but it seems pretty clear that the *obsessive* nature of the right wing's focus on this issue is because it's an easy, convenient one for them to use as a draw.

They can't talk about the economy

They can't talk about civic health or integrity in office

They have nothing else to appeal to voters, but they can run endless, contextless clips of needledicks like Ben Shapiro or Matt Walsh **""ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING""** some blue-haired college sophomore who doesn't know how to formulate an argument yet.

16ia8w6,CMV: Changing Snow White's race is parallel to changing Black Panther's race,"A new remake of Snow White is currently being made and they've, controversially, changed Snow White’s race. I disagree with this; it comes off as virtue signalling. The character's race was changed to be more diverse, presumably.  
  
Now, I don't see what makes the change in Snow White's ethnicity any different to changing Black Panther to a different ethnicity or race. Snow White’s ethnicity and complexion are integral to her character, hence her name. One relatively 'big' part of the story is her complexion and how she is the ‘fairest of them all,’ and unique because of it. Similarly, Black Panther’s name originates from the Black Panther party and his race is relatively important compared to most characters. \`  
  
Even as a person who leans left (essentially centrist), there is the double standard that much of the left holds. The double standard is the opinion or view that changing a white person’s race is okay, or perhaps even great, but changing a black person’s race is racist and deemed whitewashing. I understand there is some nuance here but I still believe the two things are on a similar level. Whitewashing is bad because it pushes forward the message that being black is ‘bad’ or not desirable. Blackwashing should be seen as bad as it pushes forward the message that whiteness is not desirable. Perhaps the intention of blackwashing in media is to be diverse, but again, I find this to be virtue signalling and there are better ways to go about this… just make new characters or new movies.  
  
In my opinion, race should not be changed if it’s an original and old character, particularly if it’s relatively integral to the character’s identity. Just make new characters.  
  
I assume that I will get replies that point out that Snow White is not Disney’s story and there are many different versions, thus, it’s not necessarily race-swapping characters. But that’s wrong:  
  


>  
Snow White is a live-action remake of the Disney animation classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" which debuted in 1937. However, it appears that Disney is approaching the seven dwarf characters in a new way in order to avoid reiterating prejudices from the first animated feature. The lead actress Zegler also hinted at the story's contemporary revisions meant to appeal to the progressive audience during the D23 event.[\[1\]](https://collider.com/snow-white-disney-live-action-remake-release-date-cast-plot/)

  
  
The issue is that Disney and other massive corporations are making *\[x\]* and then advertising it as *\[y\]*. The only reason for this is because these corporations want a bigger audience so they grab nostalgic stories such as Snow White and other classics and then reboot them to get a guaranteed audience. For example, Velma, a TV series where they race-swapped Velma, is hardly the original character- neither are the rest of the characters, really. They marketed the series as Scooby-Doo characters to gain instant and free traction despite the fact they are hardly even the same characters.   
  
So yeah, that’s basically my view. I just don’t agree with the race-swapping of random characters and I think that race-swapping Black Panther is of the same nature as race-swapping Snow White.

16cpu33,cmv: There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as an “American”,"There is nothing wrong with a citizen of the United States of America referring to themselves as “American”.

When I was studying abroad in Germany my professor and many of my European classmates took issue with me referring to myself as an American, citing imperialism and disrespecting other people from the Americas. I fail to see how this is the case. American is the official adjective for a citizen of the USA, and consensus reinforces that fact. 

If someone were to change my view, they would have to show how using the term American harms other people from the Americas in a meaningful way, and also suggest an alternative, as there needs so be some adjective.

16hxvf8,META: Transgender Topics,"# The Rule Change

Beginning immediately, r/changemyview will no longer allow posts related to transgender topics. The reasons for this decision will follow. This decision has not been made lightly by the administration of this subreddit, and has been the topic of months of discussion.

# Background

Over the past 8 months, r/changemyview has been inundated with posts related to transgender topics. I conducted a survey of these posts, and more than 80% of them ended up removed under Rule B. More importantly, a very large proportion of these threads were ultimately removed by Reddit's administrators. This would not be a problem if the topic was an infrequent one. However, for some periods, we have had between 4 and 8 new posts on transgender-related issues per day. Many days, they have made up more than 50% of the topics of discussion in this subreddit.

# Reasoning

If a post is removed by Reddit or by the moderators of this subreddit under B, we consider the thread a failure. Views have not been changed. Lots of people have spent a lot of time researching and making reasoned arguments in favor of or against a position. If the thread is removed, that effort is ultimately wasted. We respect our commenters too much to allow this to continue.

Furthermore, this subreddit was founded to change views on a wide variety of subjects. When a single topic of discussion so overwhelms the subreddit that other topics cannot be easily discussed, that goal is impeded. This is, to my knowledge, only the second time that a topic has become so prevalent as to require this drastic intervention. However, this is not r/changemytransview. This is r/changemyview. If you are interested in reading arguments related to transgender topics, we truly have a thorough and complete treatment of the topic in this subreddit's history.

# The Rule

Pursuant to Rule 4, any thread that touches on transgender issues, even tangentially, will be removed by the automoderator. Attempts to circumvent automoderation will not be treated lightly by the moderation team, as they are indicative of a disdain for our rules. If you don't know enough to avoid the topic and violate our rules, that's not that big of a deal. If you know enough to try to evade the automoderator, that shows a deliberate intent to thwart our rules. Please do not attempt to avoid this rule.

# Conclusion

The moderation team regrets deeply that this decision has been necessary. We will answer any questions in this thread, or in r/ideasforcmv. We will not entertain discussion of this policy in unrelated topics. We will not grant exceptions to this rule. We may revisit this rule if circumstances change. We are unlikely to revisit this rule for at least six months.

Sincerely,

The moderators of r/changemyview",LucidLeviathan,373,1910,0.6200000047683716,0.4435846102281652,1694636928,/r/changemyview/comments/16hxvf8/meta_transgender_topics/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-13 20:28:48
16tvzqy,CMV: The U.S. Government Should not be Allowed to Shut Down.,"Typically when an indispensable group of people have an upcoming deadline, they are expected to work day and night on a solution.  Instead, members of congress were sent home. 

This should not be an acceptable outcome.  Those in high levels of office should be expected to work as long as it takes until a solution is reached.  It is unacceptable for the ineptitude of 535 people to shut down an entity employing millions, forcing federal employees to go without pay.  

There should be harsh consequences for allowing this to happen. Members of congress should not be able to adjourn until a solution is reached, and those who choose to leave Washington during important negotiations should forfeit their right to participate in all future discussions.  If there is to be a shutdown, Congress should be expected to work day and night until a budget is passed. 

As a side note, it is also absurd that members of Congress continue to be paid when there is a shutdown, but I can accept that risking loss of pay might force people to make hasty decisions and so changing this would do more harm than good.",CabalRamona,1859,579,0.9399999976158142,0.3435620488346615,1695848626,/r/changemyview/comments/16tvzqy/cmv_the_us_government_should_not_be_allowed_to/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-27 21:03:46

16t2565,"CMV: I plan on voting for a Biden presidency for 2024, for those people that are voting for Trump, can you explain why you think a Trump presidency would be better for the country. Aside from Age or health, purely policy points.","I feel like Trump is an overwhelmingly alienating figure that's purely guided by his ego and the crowd's cheers. I don't think he has any ideological integrity and the majority of his policy is just to be contrarian for the sake of being a contrarian. A lot of his policies seem to be hard-set on nationalism and isolationism while throwing scapegoats under the bus as a rallying cry without actually addressing the issue. Things like threatening to leave NATO, his policy towards Ukraine, and starting the trade war with China. He's undoubtedly left a negative impression with our allies (setting tariffs on Germany and the UK) and generally being a joke amongst their citizens.

I'm not completely against everything he did during his presidency, like trying to get NATO allies to spend more on defense or restructuring NAFTA. But, things like constantly using an us vs them mentality has really divided people, not to mention encouraging rumors like Qanon or his poor response to rioters (the capital included). He seems have little to no mind for compromise and completely disregards moderate/bipartisan policy. He's done tremendous damage towards our institutions, things like going after the director of the FBI and undermining the authority of the NHS despite having never taken an upper level biology course. He doesn't even seem to be a republican, just a reactionary populist, while spending money on ridiculous ventures.

This is not to say I'm happy with Biden, in fact I'm not voting for Biden for Biden, but for the administration behind him. Even if they have to keep him in a hibernation tank between speeches, I'd rather have the policy of that administration over a guy that tries to purge federal bodies and pack it with loyalist yes men. I don't even blame Trump for how the pandemic was handled, I don't think any leader (Hillary included) would have produced any significantly better results and feel the same about the economy now. Sure it's sluggish and the fed is still trying to control prices, but that's the boom and bust of the market, he would have the same outcome. If Biden were reelected, I think it would be significantly better for workers rights, not to mention set up the infrastructure for energy independence.

169vziy,"CMV: If you wear MAGA swag, chances are you’re an asshole.","Not saying all Trump voters are assholes (I know many, including in my family, who are great people.) 

But if you believe in Trump’s message so fervently that you’d deck yourself out in Trump/MAGA iconography, it’s more likely than not that you’re probably a dickhead who believes in the worst, most emotive parts of his message. 

Many republicans/independents voted for him the past two elections either because he was the closest one to their position, not necessarily because they liked him. More of an anti-Democrat, pro-Republican vote than a pro-Trump vote.  If you’re sporting the red hat, or the bumper sticker, or have the flag pinned up somewhere though, it likely indicates that you’re a fan of the man himself, and by extension the more venomous elements of his platform (rabid anti-immigration in particular), rather than just lowering taxes. 

Totally open to changing my mind on this - I know that probably the counter-evidence would be anecdotal in nature and that’s fine (seeing as how my argument is based on anecdotal evidence as well - ive yet to come across a MAGA-branded person who, accounting for my own bias, wasnt a prickly cunt).

It’s not good enough, though, to just say “My dad is a good man and he loves Trump and wears the hat” - many racists/assholes/fuckheads are great with their family and neighbours.

16wfk2f,CMV: I am a 16 year old Incel who believes he will always be single and wants to change his toxic and misogynistic views on women and dating and let go of my resentment and envy.,"\[Last post got removed due to title not being descriptive enough or something. I got permission from mods for a repost\]  
I dont even know where to start. I decided to make this post because school has started again and I often see people my age and even younger kissing and dating and it upsets me so much. and I dont have anyone to turn to and ask for advice.  
I am 16 years old and havent even kissed a girl yet. I know people say i am too young to worry about that but im sick of it. so many people have sex and date in their teens when they are around my age and when they are even younger. the average age here in the UK is just 16!  
and people all over other places like the usa also have sex and date and it just kills me to know that so many people are easily able to experience what I struggle with so much.  
I fucking hate it when family members, friends, and coworkers ask about who im dating. i hate it so much. I overheard 2 women in a store talk about their sons and one of them said their 13 year old son is a big boy and already has a girlfriend. fuck that just made me seethe so much with envy.  
I have discovered the incel movement and couldnt help but sympathize with them. and I dont mean the psychopathic murderous things. I dont wish harm on anyone.  
Women/girls are the choosers and they always seem to choose some of the douchiest, stupidest, biggest fucking losers and its hard to respect women because of it. its why i have grown to resent them. Some of the girls i have known have cried and complained to their friends how their boyfriend left them, cheated, or doesnt give them much attention. girls for some reason, always seem to go for the brutes that really dont care about them.  
and I wanna make it clear I do not think I am entitled to anything (gosh i despise it when people just throw that word at us). I just feel envious and perplexed at how guys, including some of biggest jerks, easily get girlfriends while i am stuck with my hand and virtual girls. it feels so pathetic.  
I hate having desires to kiss and date girls. if i could turn gay or get rid of these desires i would in an instant. so many guys seem to take it for granted. it seems amazing to be able to hold hands, kiss, and even have sex with girls. girls are just pretty.  
There was this senior girl I had a HUGE crush on. When I walked past her I heard her talking with a friend about her having sex with a guy at her house and how he said he loved her neck.  
I later found out it was this fucking nerdy looking freshman. I saw them kissing outside of school and then I found out she slept with other guys. Before graduation, I planned to ask her out or try to flirt with her and I did but guess what? she fucking rejected me.  
The dudes she slept with werent even anything special. They werent in some band, or in the sports team, nor were they talented or rich.  
yet this fucking loose, shameless, disgraceful, skank of a whore still chose to have sex with these absolute losers.  
as much as i wanna have sex with one, I would happy with just kissing and dating. some of the things i wanna do is take a girl out to a very fun place like a bowling alley, zoo, a carnival, or an aquarium and see sharks and sea lions or even take her to eat ice cream with me at a park. i wanna have fun and live a normal teenage life but i cant because the universe seems to fucking cuck me so much. Girls seem so dirty and horny as guys yet none of them are ever interested in me. NONE. its like im destined to stay single and a virgin.  
not only do i feel pathetic and less of a man and human being in general for not being able to do what billions of people have done and what millions of people, including teens are doing as we speak, but i feel like theres such a void in me that i cant fill. i just wanna cuddle and kiss with a girl who likes me back but none of them do.  
i dont wanna date and have sex when im older. it seems boring and much less fun because you have much less free time and grownups seem so miserable all the time. i wanna do it now that im still young and have lots of free time and energy.  
Plus, I know that not ALL girls are shallow or like toxic assholes. but the ones that dont are always taken. all the good, smart, beautiful girls always have boyfriends.",_Furry_Potato_,645,1055,0.6600000262260437,0.2975880319561378,1696102207,/r/changemyview/comments/16wfk2f/cmv_i_am_a_16_year_old_incel_who_believes_he_will/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-30 19:30:07
16kcvv6,"CMV: it is morally and logically inconsistent to advocate for two murder charges in the event of the homocide of a pregnant woman, and to be believe that abortion should be legal at the same time","

So, I’m not against abortion  and I’m certainly not defending murderers of pregnant women, I just think this is an interesting test for moral consistency. Also, moral tests are inherently not easy situations, so there’s gonna be an outcome that feels shitty to a lot of people if moral consistency is achieved in this case, at least in my view. I’ve realized this also applies to cases where miscarriage is brought on by physical violence, I’m not gonna edit the whole thing to say that but just know that it is is included in every point unless it’s specifically about abortion. And to clarify, in this case I’m obviously not saying it’s morally inconsistent to charge the person who violently caused the miscarriage with *any* crime, just the murder of the fetus. 

I think it’s pretty simple reasoning: if someone believes the murderer should get an additional charge for the death of the fetus, that means the fetus should be classified as a human being in the eyes of the law. If someone gets an abortion the fetus goes from being alive to being dead, if a fetus is classified as a human being, there’s no reason this shouldn’t count as a murder. In fact, it seems like it would fit the criteria of solicitation of murder, with the mother (and anyone else who supported the abortion) being the solicitor, and the doctor who performed the operation (along with anyone who willfully aided specifically the abortion) being the actual murderer. To claim that it’s different when the mother does it while carrying the child would mean that the perpetrator of a killing determines whether it is lawful or murder. Apply this to self defense and it gets… real bad real quick. I understand that there is a difference, that difference being that the mother is carrying the fetus in the womb, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a human life being killed, if we accept that premise from the charges of murder for the fetus.",LEMO2000,283,1208,0.6899999976158142,0.2861896257610093,1694884829,/r/changemyview/comments/16kcvv6/cmv_it_is_morally_and_logically_inconsistent_to/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-16 17:20:29
16f3ker,CMV: Writing a letter to a judge as a character reference does not imply you don't believe someone did the bad thing they were convicted of,"This is spurred by the backlash to Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis writing letters as a character reference for Danny Masterson, but it can be applied to many things. 

People convicted of many crimes have others write character references to the judge prior to sentencing, and I don't believe that when that happens they necessarily think the person is innocent.  They are speaking to how they know them outside of the crime committed.  All this is so the judge can get a better picture of the person outside of the crime they have been convicted of and that can influence sentencing.   But at no point is that saying the person is innocent. 

I feel like a lot of the flak Ashton and Mila received is a bit unfair.   They were asked to do this as people who have known him for 20+ years.  They could have said no of course, but he was already going to jail for some period of time.   It didn't say he was innocent.  It didn't say they didn't believe the women who accused him.  All it said was that ""this is the person I know and this is what he did for me"".  

If you feel that these character references have no place in the justice system, that is fine.  But I think being upset that people write them at the request of lawyers is a bit much. 

I also feel that many people would do the same for someone they have known for 20+ years, and people are being a bit hypocritical.    I know if my little brother or close friend committed a crime and was going to jail, it would be hard for me to refuse to do it, even if I agree that they deserve to go to jail.",illini02,777,849,0.7099999785423279,0.2703721879549172,1694360865,/r/changemyview/comments/16f3ker/cmv_writing_a_letter_to_a_judge_as_a_character/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-10 15:47:45
16n2hy7,CMV: The only way someone can believe in a religion like Christianity is if they deliberately hold it to a much lower standard of evidence than they hold everything else.,"Most people who are religious practice perfectly sound judgment and fact-based assessment in most other aspects of their life. 

For instance, if you were a car dealer and you tried to sell a Toyota to a Christian, saying, *""This Camry can give you 300 miles per gallon,""* that Christian wouldn't believe it - and rightfully so. The Christian would demand, ""Give me a tremendous amount of evidence before I'll believe such a wild claim."" 

Same if a finance manager told a religious client, ""*Give me $10,000 today and I'll invest it and make it become $1 million in five years.""* The religious person would be rightfully skeptical. That sort of return on one's money would be well-nigh impossible, barring all but the most extreme circumstances or massive fraud.

Yet somehow, when it comes to all the far-fetched claims - that the Red Sea were literally divided in two so people could walk on dry land, that a Flood drowned all humans save eight but also that animals walked pair by pair into the Ark (including several million species of insects and spiders as well - imagine that), that dead people can resurrect, that Jesus was God Himself on Earth.........many Christians believe those to have literally have happened as well. (Yes, I know, not all are Biblical literalists, but many are.)

Then the only logical way to describe this is that these people hold their own religion to a much looser, lower standard of evidence than they demand of everything else. They hold everything else to a strict standard but hold their religion to a loose standard. (Except for religious people who are also conspiracy-theorist quacks - they hold *everything* to a loose standard.)

Wearing another culture’s clothes is not “appropriation” if it’s coming from a place of appreciation… in the same way as eating another culture’s food or listening to another culture’s music isn’t “appropriation”. Appropriation would be to APPROPRIATE another culture’s clothes, food or music, by claiming is as YOUR OWN or making a mockery of it.
Drinking tea is not appropriation, claiming it as British is.

16w65yu,"CMV: Gun violence in the United States will continue to increase, and there is nothing we can do.","My argument is basically a two-point case. I believe the following:

1. Gun control will never be passed in the United States at a federal level, which is the only way it could work, because otherwise someone truly determined to commit a mass shooting can just go to a neighboring state with more lax gun laws.
2. Even if gun control were passed on a federal level, it wouldn't work.

POINT 1: 

Look, it's no secret that the massacres keep happening more and more frequently. I tend to agree with that British journalist who said that Sandy Hook was the end of the gun control debate. Gun violence has gone from a generation-defining tragedy to something that happens every day in America. Events like Uvalde that remain in the news for a few weeks are the exception, not the rule. Plus, the general public seems to care less and less about the fact that the US is a total warzone. As an example, Greg Abbott, a very pro-gun violence politician, won 60 percent in the vote in Uvalde County even after the Robb Elementary massacre. Other countries have started putting travel warnings against the US, and still nothing ever changes even as our foreign relations suffer. I don't have any serious expectation that things will change enough for gun control to be passed federally. However, that's not even the biggest obstacle to putting an end to this plague.

POINT 2:

To those who would say that other countries have solved this problem, I'm not going to deny that. However, Canada, Australia, Germany, and other countries never had the same gun culture that we did. The US has twice as many guns per capita as fucking YEMEN. If gun control were passed tomorrow, I expect gun sales to massively increase the way they do after every high-profile mass shooting. The Second Amendment people will say ""They're trying to take our guns!"" and they'll arm up even further. Even if that doesn't happen, there are still too many guns floating around, so the only real solution is for the government to forcibly confiscate them, which would probably end in even more violence. *Even in the best-case scenario, gun violence would continue, it just wouldn't increase as exponentially as it is right now.* 

As you can imagine, I desperately want my view changed, because I don't want to believe that I have to move to another country. I just hate seeing the US devolve into a civil warzone.

16u7f78,CMV: the expansion of NATO is NOT what prompted Russia to invade Ukraine,"More specifically, my current position is that the expansion of NATO would have been an insignificant factor in the decision to invade, even if it did enter into a cost-benefit analysis. 

My reasoning for holding this belief is that:

1) NATO's expansion was not carried out actively or with aggressive intentions, but was a passive process of allowing countries in central and eastern Europe to join, due to their own security concerns. It is unlikely that the Kremlin could have seriously perceived this as a threat, since NATO is fundamentally not a war-mongering organisation, and would only ever engage in *retaliatory* combat.

2) Invading Ukraine would have been an idiotic - indeed nonsensical response, if it *was* a reaction to the NATO threat; and I don't think it's plausible that Putin and his advisors could have gotten it so wrong. Here's why it doesn't make sense:

* It always ran a significant risk of strengthening NATO (which it in fact has)
* Since the Crimea annexation, it has driven Ukraine further into the arms of the west (since they rightfully fear for their own security)
* A diplomatic approach to wooing Ukraine would have been feasible (since a majority of Ukrainians were against joining NATO prior to the Crimea annexation)
* Supposing Russia is successful in claiming Ukraine - this doesn't really help their security situation anyway; they are still directly adjacent to NATO countries.

A secondary belief, which you can engage with or not, is that the main driving force was Putin's personal desire for glory and respect, and to leave a Peter-the-Great-like legacy. I don't hold this view very strongly - so I'll also give deltas to anyone who can provide convincing arguments that it *is* correct.",CaptainQueero,479,843,0.7400000095367432,0.233430432368346,1695878942,/r/changemyview/comments/16u7f78/cmv_the_expansion_of_nato_is_not_what_prompted/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-28 05:29:02
16sssne,CMV: The Ukraine war shows that the much-hated military-industrial complex is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have.,"Few industries are despised more in the West than the military-industrial complex. Prior to the Ukraine war, progressive politicians (and some conservatives as well) constantly railed against the defense industry, questioning why the United States was spending $800 billion a year on the military when that money could have gone towards \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert your cause of choice: education, healthcare, social cause, etc.) instead. Western European nations, by and large, spent relatively little on defense (despite a NATO pledge for each member to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense). When you asked liberal voters what government item they wanted the most to see big budget cuts on, they would almost invariably say the military.

But the Ukraine war suddenly changed the tunes of many such folks. The same folks who decried the billions of dollars spent on weaponry production suddenly fretted about whether the U.S. would be able to manufacture enough 155mm artillery shells in time to assist Ukraine. The same people who thought of the U.S. defense industry as a useless pit for taxpayer dollars to be wasted now complain that we're not sending enough Abrams tanks, ATACMS, Javelins, Stingers or F-16s to Ukraine. The Daily Kos, a very left-leaning publication, has suddenly featured numerous pro-Ukraine articles detailing the need for U.S. military support of Ukraine and the amount of such.

And not to take anything away from the courage and ingenuity of the Ukrainians, who have fought more bravely and cleverly than perhaps any nation we've seen in decades, but it can clearly be seen that if it weren't for the massive amount of Western military assistance that had been given to Ukraine in the form of artillery (Ukraine was on pace to run out of its small Soviet-type artillery arsenal a year ago,) intelligence, portable anti-tank and anti-air missiles, anti-air defense (Kyiv and other major cities were repeatedly vulnerable to Russian air attacks until recently, when Western Gepards/NASAMS/Patriot/IRIS-T arrived), Ukraine would be in a far worse position than it is today. None of that would have been possible without a substantial military-industrial complex in the West.

You can't get this sort of thing on short notice. If the West had neglected defense and a war like the Ukraine conflict had broken out, it would have been impossible to spool up in time. Modern advanced military systems take years to develop. 

All of this shows is that the defense industry of the West - particularly the United States' - is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have. The whole point of a military is similar to that of the function of a fire department - it's not something you **want** to have to use, but you need it to be there for emergencies. (Assuming your military is used for defense, not offense, of course.) Furthermore, the same progressives who complain about $800 billion spent on the military often overlook the fact that the United States spends far **more** than that on healthcare, Medicare, Social Security every year. The military is actually a relatively small component of the U.S. federal budget.

Of course, there are major issues with over-pricing and bloat in the U.S. defense industry (there's no excuse for F-35 development and production to have been the SNAFU that it was,) and much reform is needed. But the Ukraine war has shown that a military-industrial complex is something people like to hate in peacetime, but learn to grasp the value of in wartime.

16sc1lv,CMV: Police should have to be exemplary members of society and constantly abide by the law or lose their job.,"This isn't a debate on law breaking or if its ever ok. It's calling out the double standards of law enforcement.

Everyone can agree that police should at minimum have sound judgement, not be racist, as well as be trusted to protect and serve their community.

Unfortunately that's not common enough. But let's not stop there.

How many cops have you seen driving around on their cell phones? Speeding without their lights on? Illegally parked and not on a call? Making illegal uturns? Expecting free/ discounted food? When I worked in customer service I even had a cop have a tantrum that I couldn't give them the police discount when they were off the clock (I recognized them, as they were a regular)

Yet when starving, hungry people steal food they throw the book at them and put them in jail. They park where nobody else is allowed to park looking for others speeding, when that's all they do all day. Giving tickets for not stopping long enough for right on red and they don't even brake at the red light when nobody's coming. Etc. But it's a hell worthy offense if anyone else does any of this.

Imo an officer should have a dashcam on them at all times in addition to body cams. If they're speeding with no cause, they lose their job. Riding around holding their cellphones? No job. Any offense they ticket others for, if they are caught doing it, no job.

They can't even follow the law and they're supposed to enforce it? The hypocritical cops should just get fired. If they don't care enough about the law to follow it themselves they need to find a new line of work.",JollyMcStink,900,406,0.9100000262260436,0.1925797527751514,1695696792,/r/changemyview/comments/16sc1lv/cmv_police_should_have_to_be_exemplary_members_of/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-26 02:53:12
169zp5h,CMV: Involuntary treatment of psychiatric medication makes me very uncomfortable,"So as a psychiatric patient of over 8 years who has been on several medicines, I have experienced some unpleasant side effects. I have also been involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. I was also administered medication against my will because of my severe mental health issues. This bothers me because these medications cause nasty side effects and psychiatrists, PAs, and NPs have the nerve to gaslight patients into taking their medication. Gaslighting is a separate topic but ties into this. Apparently doctors can gaslight psychiatric patients into taking medications by saying...

&#x200B;

>You're mentally ill. You think the medications are poisonous and you are agitated. This proves that you are mentally ill and cannot think rationally to make your own decisions about medication.

Therapists also gaslight their patients but again, this is a separate issue. The idea that you can be given medication whether you like it or not is bothersome. There always need to be informed consent to treatment. Coercion and force is an abuse of power that makes patients distrustful towards their healthcare providers. We don't advocate for coercion or force when it comes to sex, then why not medication treatment? 

Psychiatrists also threaten patients into an *alternative outpatient treatment center* to ensure compliance. This again is bothersome since a patient should have the right to refuse any treatment, especially in outpatient settings. Why do we have court ordered mandates and alternative outpatient treatment centers for psychiatry but not other disciplines?

I live in MN with some of the worst winter's in the country, so while I appreciate the need for all-wheel drive, I know with certainty it's not an absolute need. And if it is for the rare case, most families have 2 vehicles, other another SUV with AWD capabilities.

Most American families live in the suburbs and do not go off-road. The purchase of an SUV is therefor mostly for show. Minivans sit as high as SUVs, so sight is not an issue. The carrying capacity of minivans is equal to or greater than most SUVs. The gas mileage is equal to or better. The technology and safety features are equal to or exceed SUVs. The ""styling"" or ""craftsmanship"" is, to me, a dubious excuse due to the following: the only thing most SUVs for families has over a minivan is simply a reputation. So, I beleive most families purchase an SUV to impress others or signal a status to other people.

16tmynl,CMV: You did not defend or protect our country if you have served in the American armed forces in the last 80 years,"Let me quickly get this out of the way: I am an American, and anyone who enlists in the armed forces has my respect, as they are committing to a profession that is hard, dangerous, and often scary. They put more on the line than I ever will in my career...

That being said, I pity our armed forces. Anyone who says that our veterans and active duty personnel ""fought for or protected our country"" is lying to themselves. There has not been a direct threat to America since WW2. I respect the hell out of WW2 vets, for example, as they put their lives on the line to truly protect their country, democracy, and human rights.

But since then, any conflict America has been in were conflicts they arguably shouldn't have stuck their nose in. Whether they were trying to make a statement, were overblowing the threat, or were using it as an excuse for some alternative motive, they were all conflicts that posed little to no threat to America.

Anyways, this post isn't about whether we should or shouldn't have been involved. It's about how I pity our armed forces, as they have been brainwashed to believe they are ""protecting and defending out country"" when, in reality, they are putting their lives on the line just to be a pawn for what the USA wants to do. The military masks the reality with patriotism, selflessness, and the call to duty. This is all bull shit meant to appeal to men and women who are easily persuaded and have few options for their future. (i.e. Living in a small town with no career opportunities, or unable to attend higher education after high school, or people who seek a ""purpose"")

It just makes me sick seeing the military commercials or ROTC recruitment at high schools. They are so blatantly trying to appeal to kids who don't know better, making them feel important by throwing around words like ""patriotism"" and ""duty"" and ""a higher calling."" It's all BS, no different than a cult who recruits their members by telling them exactly what they want to hear even if it's a lie. They are giving these kids a fake purpose just so that they will make sacrifices to accomplish their greedy ambitions. 

It's so messed up and I wonder why no one else sees through it. We blindly praise veterans and active duty personnel for their service, when, in reality, I don't think their service is anything I should be thanking them for. The only people who should be thanking them are the higher ups who gain from their sacrifices.

16lk40j,CMV: Conservatism is the form fascism takes when it’s out of fashion.,"Fascism never fully disappears. When defeated, it only pulls it's head back into its shell until it feels safe enough to come out. Many conservatives in the U.S. today would never consider themselves fascist, but are clearly unwittingly enabling its return. We need to call Conservatism what it is. It's 'Fascism Lite’.

Unfortunately, ‘Fascism Lite’ is ripe for take-over. Easy to stoke into a frenzy. It’s been on a gradual march toward power for decades in America, always — always — on the Right. It knows how unpopular it is, so it plays the long game. It buys influence. It gerrymanders. It stacks courts with its own decision-makers. It closely examines the rules and plays them in ways unanticipated. It uses religion (A tool built to cement power. How do you question that which must not be questioned on threat of eternal damnation?). Its got a goal and its got time.

16mnb8a,CMV: Millennials and Gen Z are Screwed. Perhaps Irredeemably So...,"In the past decade and a half, the media has been full of stories about how [entitled](https://incafrica.com/ryan-jenkins/this-is-why-millennials-are-entitled.html), [lazy](https://africa.businessinsider.com/careers/gen-z-workers-are-lazy-some-bosses-say-they-dont-do-anything-unless-every-second-of/57pqptd) and unambitious the millennials and gen z cohort are. I do not believe this is entirely accurate for the following reasons:

1. **Academic Inflation (Modern Job Market > Kumite) :** The increased number of kids going to college has been a double edged sword. On one hand, the increased amount of college educated kids means that we have a more sceptical and literate populations which may be good for society. However, while research does seem to suggest that Gen-Z and Millennials are by some metrics the [most educated generation in many countries history's](https://www.businessinsider.in/policy/economy/news/millennials-have-struggled-to-find-well-paid-jobs-despite-being-the-most-educated-generation-its-because-there-are-more-college-degrees-but-fewer-jobs-that-require-them-/articleshow/93913920.cms), it also means that there is suddenly an abundant supply of talent for companies. And all of this ignores the effects of automation, introduction of minorities into the workforce and immigration. The end result of this process is academic inflation which that it has gotten a lot more difficult for the young to secure [jobs](https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/gen-z-set-more-qualified-29264859). Most people that know a Millennial/Gen Z have probably heard of one horror story of how tough it seems to be to get into employment in the modern job market. I believe that this situation is unsalvageable because increasingly we start to see power law distributions being caused by a Matthew effect (i.e. Those lucky enough to gain experience are hounded for jobs while those without are stuck in a loop in which they become more and more undesirable as candidates.) 
2. **Wage Stagnation (Where'd All The Good Jobs Go?):** Following up on my previous point of there being an oversupply of labour, companies have felt no real incentive to hike wages to keep talent. If talent is no longer scarce and can be obtained for cheap due to market . All this has been going on while the cost of living has been on the rise making it a lot [harder](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/wages-have-fallen-43-for-millennials-no-wonder-they-ve-lost-hope/) for people working in these positions to keep up with the cost of living. 
3. **Climate Change (Don't Look Up...No Really):** This one is a lot more controversial. It is well known that our climate is changing. Most of this change is being driven by human activity and is set to have [devastating effects](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/harvard-experts-discuss-climate-change-fears/) on life as we know it unless something is done about it. However, most big polluters seem [disinterested in slowing down](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/china-avoids-climate-change-discussion-despite-extreme-weather-2023-08-11/) any pollution efforts if it comes at the cost of their prosperity. Such trends mean that short of a string of very successful scientific breakthroughs, the younger generation seems condemned to live in a world that has far less habitable land area and more susceptible to extreme events. Geoengineering remains a deeply controversial area of research [for many reasons](https://time.com/6264143/geoengineering-climate-scientists-divided/). If things remain as they are, it means we are only left with few other alternatives, the main one being, accept that the situation is irreversible (at least for now,) and buck up and take it.
4. **Sex Recession (An Indicator of Deeper Problems)**: It has been discovered that [marriage](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/does-marriage-make-you-happier/675145/) provides human beings with happiness that is unsurpassed by very few things. This is yet another facet of life in which Millennials/Gen-Zs have been caught lacking by circumstances outside of their control. Due to some of the reasons mentioned above and a lot more that I have left out of this argument, [younger folks are not marrying](https://sundial.csun.edu/168571/print-editions/fact-check-why-younger-generations-are-saying-i-dont/) at the same rates or even showing any interest in performing acts that would make it easier to have a family [(such as engaging in sexual activity.](https://nypost.com/2023/06/01/gen-z-is-having-a-sex-recession-and-here-are-the-reasons-why/)) The impact (and presence, frankly) of hook-up culture has largely been [overblown by the media](https://time.com/88092/hookup-culture-myth-study/) and current statistics show that Gen-Z/Millennials [have a lot less bedroom traffic than their predecessors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2016/08/16/millennials-are-having-less-sex-than-other-gens-but-experts-say-its-probably-fine/?sh=4bc66ee6d958). As [Japan](https://www.newsweek.com/japan-population-decline-births-deaths-demographics-society-1796496), [South Korea](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Work/South-Korea-looks-to-foreign-workers-to-solve-demographic-crisis) and even [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/upshot/china-population-decline.html) will tell you, this is a very difficult trend to reverse. Once men and women are not interested in coming together and starting families, population collapse is almost a certainty.

To end I wish to give the definition of the word, ""entitled"" which is ""Believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment."" From this information, it would seem that such a label cannot apply to Millennials and Gen-Z.  In the words of John Burn-Murdoch, chief data reporter for the Financial Times, ""They have done everything they were told to do, yet the fruits of their labours are proving elusive.""",Zero-zero20,534,448,0.8100000023841858,0.1575193472703715,1695119280,/r/changemyview/comments/16mnb8a/cmv_millennials_and_gen_z_are_screwed_perhaps/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-19 10:28:00

And I think Biden emphasized that point perfectly. If you’re an American who denies elections, American is just a description of your passport, not who you are. An American who *didn’t* have contempt for everything that we stand for would not deny elections, again, without proof, and **especially** they would not deny their elections in an illegal manner.

Of course, words should be backed by actions, and, while of course Biden can’t charge anybody, his DOJ has done a great job cracking down on election denial when it’s done in an illegal manner. For example, the DOJ has arrested multiple people on Jan 6 charges and while most are under-sentenced, it sends a good message. Same with the Jan 6 charges related to Trump and charges related to asking Georgia to overturn their election. The government has done a good job of letting the good people know that election deniers will not be tolerated. The best way to stop election denial is to absolutely crack down on it. With the Trump arrests and most importantly the Jan 6 arrests, the government has let it be known that we will *not* let election deniers harm the very fabric of this country. 

Now, to be fair, I’m not saying we can’t complain about the electoral process itself. It’s perfectly fine to think elections should be done in x manner or y manner, but if you want to claim the process was carried out in a rigged manner, then you should have to give proof for your claim.

16k8wdg,CMV: Americans are not as poor as they think they are,"The internet in general and reddit in particular is full of Americans complaining about how poor they are and how they literally (!) can't survive on what they earn.  
  
I accept that many Americans are perfectly sincere in this belief, but that doesn't make it true. **Most Americans** are richer than ever, and richer than most people in the world. The evidence shows that they consume more than ever, \[live in bigger homes, etc\](https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/housing/). Most of the people complaining are objectively some of the luckiest people in world history, and the rest of the world is tired of their narcissistic whining. There are lots of actually poor people in the world  (and even in America itself) who deserve our sympathy and help far more.  
  
2 Counter-arguments I reject  
  
**1. Prices have increased therefore Americans are poor (e.g. recent post-Covid inflation; long run increases in house prices, university tuition, health care. )**  
  
I don't deny that prices for many things have increased in recent decades, and this reduces the amount of those things that people can buy. However, this does not necessarily mean that Americans are objectively poor, or poorer than they used to be. Price changes are a normal part of economic development (e.g. as an economy gets richer, food and manufactured goods get cheaper in hours of work you have to put in to get them, while labour-intensive services like education automatically get more expensive). When prices for certain things increase, people have to make trade-offs they didn't have to before, and this may feel unpleasant because they can't have everything they thought they could have (or exactly what their parents had). But they can still buy plenty of nice things, including functional substitutes that are much better than what their parents had.  
  
**2. Inequality: America is rich, but the top 1% took it all**  
  
It is true that poor people in America are poorer than poor people in other rich countries because the US has unusually high level of income inequality. So I don't deny that **some** Americans are poor. But not most Americans, or the average American, which is the claim I see constantly.  
  
I also don't deny that a disproportionate share of the economic gains of the last 40 years have accrued to the already rich, or that social mobility in the US has declined. One can certainly complain that this is **unfair**, and that the average American would be even richer if economic policies had been different. But that imaginary counterfactual doesn't mean that Americans in general are actually poor against any reasonable benchmark, whether that be meeting their basic needs; the rest of the world; or Americans from previous generations.",phileconomicus,64,650,0.5600000023841858,0.143420727467371,1694874482,/r/changemyview/comments/16k8wdg/cmv_americans_are_not_as_poor_as_they_think_they/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-16 14:28:02
169qn9x,CMV: Politicians should be subject to perjury as a part of their official duties.,"Politicians can have an incredible effect on the lives of people in the country, whether those people are constiuients or otherwise.

When politicians can knowingly lie without fear of consequences it creates a rift on uncertainty and inherent mistrust between the Civil Servant and the people they represent.

I believe that a sworn in Politician who at any time they are acting in an official capacity should be subject to perjury charges if it can be shown that they knowingly lied.

My first thought regarding this is freedom of speech of the politician, however there is already a precedent for temporary removal of that right with members of the Armed Forces, so I don't see why Politicians can't have a similar requirement.

""United States v. Caldwell, 75 M.J. 276 (in the context of freedom of speech in the military, servicemembers do not possess the same broad rights of expression that civilians enjoy; this principle holds true even in regard to interactions between superiors and subordinates).""

I don't think this can be applied to Canidates prior to being sworn in as they haven't yet made an Oath of Office.

16cj4ib,CMV: Most people's religious beliefs are largely influenced by their societal and familial upbringing rather than a personal search for truth,"I've been thinking a lot about the influence of culture and family on our personal beliefs, especially in the realm of religion. It seems to me that the majority of people tend to follow the religion of their parents or the dominant religion of the region they grew up in. For instance, someone born in a predominantly Christian region might naturally grow up with Christian beliefs, while someone born in the Middle East might be more likely to adopt Islamic beliefs.

While I acknowledge that many individuals do undergo personal spiritual journeys and might change their beliefs over time, I can't help but think that for a significant portion of the global population, religious beliefs are more a product of upbringing and societal constructs than personal exploration.

I genuinely want to understand this better and am open to having my view changed or expanded upon. I would love to hear experiences, perspectives, and any counterarguments to this notion.

16q2x1q,"CMV: All schools should have a mandatory subject about ''after school life'' which cover topics such as student loans, politics and basic law/rights.","The reason for a CMV about this is because to me this sounds like it's obviously a good thing and should most definitely be done, but I'm also fairly certain that there's a reason it's not. I just can't think of a *good* reason as to why it isn't compulsory other than the education system as a whole is outdated and needs an overhaul but it doesn't happen for whatever reason. I don't know too much about this, so excuse the ignorance.   


A subject like this should be compulsory for all students, but passing/failing it has no impact on whether or not they pass school. It should however impact whether or not they're able to apply for a student loan. If they're unable to pass a basic test about how student loans work and what they'll end up paying and the laws about it, then they simply should not be able to get it. It seems irresponsible to have an 18 year old kid take out a contract like that without them understanding the basics of it.   


Other topics covered by this subject should include stuff like basic politics and how the political system works. The consequence for failing this part should be that they're unable to vote ( or at least unable to until a certain age ) with the ability to retake the test as many times as they want, at no cost. I understand some people would strongly disagree with this because they may feel like it's some kind of discrimination and I imagine these would be the same type of people who disagree with voters requiring ID, but I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of people would agree to this. Oh, and also a government ID should be issued to them too at school. Absolutely no reason to not have one. I'm from South Africa and got my ID in grade 10. And if a country like that can get this right, I see no reason for a ''first world'' country to mess it up.   


Of course, this isn't a perfect list of topics that ''should'' be covered, but this is a rough idea on my thoughts. Nitpicking at an oversight or tiny detail is not going to change my view, rather fault the idea itself. The reason I believe this to be the right thing to do has nothing to do with discriminating against illiterate people or people one might believe to be stupid, it is simply there to help someone better understand the world they're stepping into. Failing to understand the basics of something like a loan should be viewed in the same way as failing to understand the contract you're signing where it says '' sign here to  confirm you understand the T&C '', except that this is a test to ensure that you do actually understand the basics of the T&C's

This will surely ruffle a few feathers but I really am wanting to understand how someone with a different perspective than me would respond to this. 

In the US, it is legal to have differing views on religion and to not be religious at all. A Christian cannot be forced to be atheist just like an atheist cannot be forced to be Christian. Everyone should be entitled to their own beliefs. 
So that being said, if it is a Christian’s belief that abortion is murder (and this belief is usually heavily rooted in religion) but a non Christian believes that abortion is not murder, why is there a need to create a law that heavily aligns with the Christian side? If we want to create a land where everyone feels accepted regardless of what religious views they hold, what need is there for a law that only agrees with specific religious groups? 

I’d also like to add I know not all Christians are pro life and not all non-christians are pro choice. This is just a common trend I’ve seen on the media and I want to understand an outside perspective. 

I guess I find abolishing abortion somewhat ironic. Someone who is christian and pro life should absolutely be accepted for who they are and that belief. On the flip side, someone who is not christian and pro choice should also be accepted for that belief.",bigfeelings1231,125,599,0.6700000166893005,0.1400744876162462,1695197834,/r/changemyview/comments/16nfpwl/cmv_if_it_is_legal_to_have_opposing_religious/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-20 08:17:14

16ii0kt,CMV: Bad moms don't deserve their child's forgiveness and their presence in their lives,"Even if they change later in life, what happened can't be erased and they basically ruined a huge part of their child's life. 

I know there might be a debate about what a ""bad mom"" is. I would say that if a person considers that their mom played a big part in their unhappiness during their childhood/teenagehood then she is to be considered a bad mom. 

My mom is definitely one of them and I don't think she deserves to have a good relationship with me today, or any relationship at all. 

Around the age of 11 she stopped being affectionate with me. No more hugs, no more kisses, no more cute nicknames, no more good nights in bed.

In middle school, she would criticize my only friend and call her weird, and told me I was becoming weird like her (I became insecure)

She called me an idiot very regularly during that period, compared me to others, belittled me.

She constantly criticized and judged my personality, the way I ate, the way I spoke, the way I behaved, what I talked about, the fact that I was close to my friends...

She wasn't the type of mom who talked to me, asked me how my day was at school, laughed with me, was affectionate, smiled at me... when she spoke to me it was only criticism and negativity.

She was always grumpy and moody. I very rarely saw her smile at home and she always looked at me with side eyes and disgust when I passed in the living room. Because of that, I stayed in my room a lot and almost never spoke to her. She blamed me a lot for that.

I wasn't allowed to invite friends. I wasn't allowed to go to my friends' houses. I wasn't allowed to go out with friends after school, on weekends or during vacations even when I was 20 (or even alone, I never went out except to go to school). I wasn't allowed to have a phone or wear makeup until I was 18. She never gave me money so I couldn't buy anything on my own until I was 18 when I was finally financially independent. I was never allowed to cut my hair. I wasn't allowed to dye my hair either. I wasn't allowed to go to parties even when I was in college. I wasn't allowed to have a boyfriend, especially if he wasn't Muslim. My life was just school and home, I could only go out with my older sister or my mom and my aunt. I would do things behind her back and lie to her because all I asked was ""no"" 90% of the time. No concerts, no trips, no movies, no sleepovers, no beaches, no festivals, no parties, no birthdays even when my friends invited me. She deprived me of many of the pleasures one experiences at that age.

Every time I did things that went against her, something she didn't like, she became very aggressive. She screamed, insulted me (whore, crazy, scum..), grabbed my neck or my arms aggressively, squeezing, spat on me and became even crazier when I held her arms to stop her from hurting me. Sometimes she closed the shutter and the door of my room and forced me to sleep even at 7-8 p.m. after her tantrum.

Her grudge would last for days. She would remind me that she is the mother and that she has all the rights, that I must respect her and do everything she says. She threatened me that I wouldn't go anywhere and that if I tried to escape, she would find me. She had her crazy moments where she would tell me that she wished that I would get sick and disappear so that she would be alone, or that if I tried to escape, she would take a knife and  would stab me and go to jail for that. She's already had phrases like ""you're not my daughter anymore"" (when I was in middle school) or ""shouldn't I have aborted that one?""  in a fit of anger.

Today I'm 26 and I no longer live with her. She changed and became nicer, she has made efforts to sort things out and wish to have a good mother/daughter relationship with me. I still don't think she deserves to have me in her life. Same for other moms who did similar things. I know it's hard being a parent but nothing justifies abuse and toxicity.",Petite_Curious,618,308,0.8799999952316284,0.1383394614280211,1694696840,/r/changemyview/comments/16ii0kt/cmv_bad_moms_dont_deserve_their_childs/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-14 13:07:20
16uvn4r,"CMV: Abortion is technically murder, but at the same time women should be paid to have children","**Regarding Abortion**

First of all, I want to clarify that I am not advocating for a total ban. Rather, I believe we need to change the way the practice is both viewed and restricted. Note that everything below pertains to regular cases of abortions, not abortions due to rape/incest which many would agree should be treated with a separate considerations:

* Generally agree with the Ben Shapiro argument, at least in so far as to why fetuses should be considered humans. If it is properly taken care of for a long enough, a fetus that lacks pretty much everything will develop into an infant with under-developed senses, then a pre-teen with under-developed reproductive organs, all the way until they are around 25 y.o. when their brain is fully developed and the aging process begins. Under a Roe v. Wade style policy we draw the line at the first stage of development (""senses""). I believe this is problematic since we're essentially saying that it's ok to kill a human if they have no awareness of it, which can also apply to many grown adults. The same problem happens regardless of where the line is drawn, not to mention the whole mess when it comes to premature babies. This clearly puts abortion as a form of human murder in my view.
* However, this doesn't mean that this form of murder should be completely outlawed because *we don't actually do that*. We justify killing criminals, terrorists, and even home invaders if we believe they either have caused or have the potential to cause great harm. (think: the baby Hitler argument scaled way down). Going even further, would you, say, shoot down a few hundred innocent civilians on those planes knowing that many thousands of lives would be saved on that day and tens of thousands more from the war? Many would say yes, including many who have sacrificed their lives on one of them. Strangely, the same argument can be applied to innocent fetuses if their potential life will most definitely ruin the potential life of at least the mother. My point here is that I also see the motivation behind a left-leaning stance. Most of us are willing to accept certain immoralities/externalities behind things like eating meat, driving cars, or even participating in a capitalistic system because it's a fact of life. Big fishes eat smaller ones every day regardless of how ""innocent"" the small fish is.
* To add to that, I do still agree that it is ""better"" to kill a human fetus than say a human infant precisely because of the ""awareness"" factor. This further justifies the act, but just because it is ""better"" doesn't mean it is not murder. We must properly recognize the moral weight of such a decision.
* Overall, the point is that I believe we should approach abortion with at least the stigma of it technically being a murderous act, rather than ""it's fine if it is done early enough."" Though it is still a grey issue, the moral weight here should be quite a lot higher than most pro-abortion stances suggest. Furthermore, the current restriction system disadvantages the poor on a moral level as well. It's one thing to commit murder if it would otherwise ruin your life, those around you, and ultimately force a child who did not ask to be born to grow up impoverished. It's another thing to do the same if you have the means and having an unexpected child is - at least relative to others - an inconvenience.
* So what's the alternative if it makes little sense to draw the line based on the pregnancy calendar? This I don't know for sure. It could maybe be a limited strike-based system, or maybe special case-by-case evaluations that adheres to more holistic standard. It'll never be perfect since this is a problem that likely demands a one-size-fits-all solution. Regardless, I believe at the very least we need to move away from the current moral framing around the debate.

**Regarding Childbirth Support**

The above section ultimately poses a right-wing POV against abortion in that it should be treated with greater moral weight and hence more restricted (albeit through different means) compared to a standard Roe v. Wade position. 

However, it bothers me that in the 21st century we have yet to address the fact that women bear the brunt of child-bearing/raising responsibilities without much in return. Yes, we have established things like 50/50 divorces, alimony, pregnancy grants, post-pregnancy support, childcare, paid maternity leave etc. but the overall economic payouts of all of these combined is no where near enough to compensate for the true effort and sacrifices involved with carrying and raising a child, let alone the fact you need to meet certain standards to qualify. The way I see it, this imbalance represents much if not most of what remains in the fight to bridge the gender inequality.

Since we can't make men bear child, I believe the next best form of rebalancing is simply financial compensation/support. Not a few billion a year, but a few *hundred* billion:

* Let's start with some statistics. The average cost of raising a child in the U.S. is around $300k. There are around 4 million births annually. Women on average have slightly less than 2 children in their lifetime. The median household income is around $80k and the median household net worth is around $120k. Our federal budget in 2022 is around $6.5T.
* With these numbers in mind, giving a $100k grant to every woman for the first born child would cost a little over $200B/year (100k \* 4M/2). You can compare this to whatever major social or discretionary programs you'd like, but it's basically nothing in the grand scheme of things.
* I believe the correct amount should be closer to $200k-300k, distributed over different age ranges based on expected cost until the child turns 18 on the simple condition the mother meets the regular social services standards in caring for the child. This amounts to $400B-600B/year. There are many reasonable ways to find the money. I believe it should mostly come from an additional progressive tax (maybe weighted more heavily toward men with children) but maybe some cuts to related social programs like education/childcare could also be appropriate.
* Why I believe this is a good idea:
   * I alleviates the quandary behind the majority of what would have been abortion cases.
   * It tackles gender inequality and simultaneously serve as a wealth distribution program.
   * The UBI argument: The program simply recycles cash in the hands of citizens who can then make free market choices. It is also easy to understand and execute, meaning that there is no real reason to invent large overheads and/or involve any form of privatization, hence less room for inefficiency and corruption.
   * Also UBI: The benefits are both uniform and progressive. Every child comes with their own challenges and every woman is compensated equally, but lower-income households will feel the impact more strongly.
   * It could potentially be another deterrent to illegal immigration by furthering the gap between how easy it is for legal and illegal citizens to get by. If you don't see this as a pro then we'd need to get into the whole immigration can of worms.

**Preemptively Addressing a Few Potential Counter-arguments:**

* Abortion:
   * What about ""my body my rights""? The argument doesn't really hold here if we've established that abortion is technically murder. So if you disagree with that premise then CMV.
   * Killing fetuses without their ""consent"" is definitely unconstitutional if we've accepted that they are humans - Yes, but I would like to focus this discussion from a moral/logical POV rather than on the basis of an old and ambiguous legal document.
* Childbirth Support
   * Money can't solve everything. What about the emotional cost of raising a child? Yes, but it's the best straight-forward, one-size-fits-all solution in my view. If you have a better idea to rebalance the child-bearing/raising gap then CMV.
   * What if the $200k or so is not used to benefit the child? The idea of the grant is ultimately compensation to women for the opportunity cost of child-bearing/raising, but I also believe in most cases both should naturally come hand in hand. 
   * If this is a form of UBI, wouldn't it cause inflation? No this is ultimately a redistribution program. The recent inflation was caused by excessive money printing and UBI just got a bad rep by association. I believe UBI can be effective if applied correctly.

There you have it. This is my first post here and I'd have to admit I'm not a political junkie so please educate me if I'm misinformed on anything. Did not do too too much research either so I'm sure there are flaws in my argument - CMV.",Aggressive_Shame_726,0,660,0.2300000041723251,0.137844611528822,1695944382,/r/changemyview/comments/16uvn4r/cmv_abortion_is_technically_murder_but_at_the/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-28 23:39:42

I love the idea that my country could be so great that people uproot their entire lives and those of their families to come here and start over and improve their well-being. 

There are also numerous objective benefits immigrants bring to the USA. I remember one of my college history professors saying that one of the major reasons that the US didn’t undergo a revolution or major social upheaval in the 30’s was the large immigrant population. Our national unemployment is roughly non-existent and our companies need people to work jobs to continue to grow and prosper. If there was ever a time in the last century to have a generous, functional, effective immigration policy, this is it.

Which is not what we have right now. What we have is a total free-for-all at the border, that ultimately serves neither the immigrants hoping to establish a new, better, life in the USA, nor the country as a whole. Let’s start with basic questions of security:

Our federal agencies have very limited operational control of the border. People constantly cross between ports of entry. It’s widely known among federal agencies that cartel operators funnel migrants to mass and cross at particular locations in order to occupy Border Patrol, so they can smuggle contraband in the vacated crossings. The shear mass of numbers of migrants crossing overwhelm the ability of Border Patrol to vet them, allowing only the most cursory of background checks, which will completely miss any criminality in their home country. And this is only for the migrants who surrender themselves/are caught by Border Patrol. Some of the contraband that the cartels smuggle over are human beings who, for one reason or another, want to stay off of the federal government’s radar.

The way most of these migrants are hoping to normalize their status in the United States is the asylum process. Many of them are unaware that at best this is a temporary patch on a system that will eventually leave them in legal limbo. It is easy to claim asylum, but not so easy for it to be granted. To claim it, you pretty much just have to say that you have a credible fear of being persecuted back in your home country. At this point the migrant will receive a notice to appear (NTA) before an immigration judge where that claim will be adjudicated. At the point, the migrant is generally free to go where they please. They may apply for a work permit six months after making this claim. So they can start their lives, get a job, etc. while they are waiting to be actually granted asylum, but what many do not understand is that asylum is only granted for credible fear of persecution based on a narrow set of criteria. Even though it takes years for those asylum claims to be adjudicated, at the end of the day only about 15% of claimants are granted asylum. Because ICE only prioritizes deportations of serious criminals, those who are denied asylum still generally remain in the US, but they have no legal status and are extremely vulnerable to changes in policy or political leadership.

Both of these are batshit crazy ways to run a country: a functionally open border, and a pathway to status normalization that fails 15% of the time. The alternative for a migrant, of course, is to apply for a visa in the legal way, but this is a laughable solution. There is no visa category of “economic immigrant.” You either need to have a family member who is already a citizen, highly educated, professional job qualifications in specific fields, or lots and lots of money. There is NO legal pathway for someone who wants to just come to the United States to be a roofer, or a restaurant worker. Actually, that’s not totally true. There are H2B visas. However, the US only gives out 66,000 of those a year, and they are by statute temporary visas with no pathway to permanent residency. 

This is no way to run a railroad. I have no problem with the number of immigrants coming into the United States, but I do want the government to be sure they are the right ones. Certainly most who are coming are decent people, but the government needs to at least have the ability to sort out the few bad actors and deny them entry. Allowing bad actors and contraband through is a great way to radicalize public opinion against immigration and stoke racial and ethnic resentment and paranoia. It also needs a sane visa process for economic migrants. Having millions of rejected asylum-seekers living underground lives, open to exploitation, and in a precarious legal condition is a terrible way to bring in immigrants. 

I hated the idea of Trump’s wall when he ran on it in 2016, but it pains me to say that I think it needs to be built. It’s definitely not a solution in and of itself, but it can at least start the process of creating an orderly immigration system. Some might ask how the US would pay for improved border security and visa processing (I don’t see this as an ingenuous concern considering US federal spending practices, but it can at least be addressed and knocked down). Well, cartels are charging virtually everyone who crosses the US border between $5000 and $10000 each (taking advantage of our ineptitude to enrich their coffers). Even if we undercut their prices by 50% to charge immigration fees to applicants, these fees would offset much of the cost, and allow migrants to use the remainder of their savings to take routes from their home countries to the United States that are safer than a trek through the Darien Gap and a 1000 mile ride on the top of a Mexican train.

This is long enough already, but one final thought I need to include is that another direct result of this ineptitude is the enabling of the explosive enrichment and growth of the cartels. It’s created an opportunity for them to charge these enormous travel fees to migrants and smuggle contraband of all kinds across the border. Their annual revenue has ballooned into the billions of dollars and the US runs the real risk that in the future they could completely overrun the Mexican government and establish a true narco-state just across the border. (For those thinking that I’m being hyperbolic, Mexico’s annual tax revenue is $22 billion. The cartel’s estimated annual revenue is $13 billion. I know who my money is on in the long term, considering how much more the government has to spend money on other than security compared to the cartels.)

Maybe that’s the kind of thing that will be necessary before the United States takes immigration seriously, but at that point any hope of the sane, generous, orderly immigration policy that I think we need will be lost. There’s no way that’s happening once our southern neighbor become the Republic of Sinaloa.",solishu4,288,457,0.800000011920929,0.1299379686741804,1695384714,/r/changemyview/comments/16p8ny1/cmv_us_immigration_policy_is_a_total_shitshow/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-22 12:11:54
16m25zs,CMV: Far-left “tankie” media is harmful to democracy.,"I know the word “tankies” has had a lot of meanings throughout history. For the purposes of this post it refers to the modern way it’s commonly used, i.e. far-left “anti-imperialists” who tend to hate the nebulous West. 

I’m talking about the Grayzone/Multipolarista types, the Max Blumenthals, Ben Nortons, and their ilk. To them, the concept of democracy is secondary to the demise of Western power. 

They present themselves as anti-imperialists because they ostensibly support the liberation of smaller “global south” nations under the grip of global hegemony. Now, I’m all for anti-imperialism in principle, every country should have the maximum amount of self determination possible to shepherd their people into as prosperous a future as possible without some big power boot on their neck. 100%. 

The problem I have with tankies in this context is that anti-imperialism should be pro-democracy. But that is not what’s emanating from these circles. 

In practice, what it looks like is simply being anti-West. If the US, Europe, or their allies are in *any* way even tangentially involved in some geopolitical conflict or dispute, it doesn’t matter what the conflict is, or where it is, or what the motivations are, or who is involved, or what they are doing, the other side is *always right* to these people. 

They seem to giddily support all manner of autocratic brutality as long as it is done in the service of damaging the West’s influence in the world. Everything is a zero-sum game, and the West must never win it no matter what the cost. 

They deny atrocities and push any manner of conspiracy theories (White helmets being false flag terrorists. China not committing atrocities against Uyghurs, no chemical weapons use in Syria, etc.) that would put their favorite dictators in a bad light and, by extension, advance the Western position. 

Look at Syria, Russia, China, Venezuela, Cuba, etc. There is seldom even the slightest, most tepid condemnation for the crimes that these governments impose on their own people and others, because they are “fighting” or “resisting” western influence, and by virtue of that, they can do no wrong in the context of this great power struggle. 

I have yet to see any evidence that they would be willing to forcefully condemn “non-west” dictators for anything they do, as long as the US/Europe oppose them, or any evidence that they would support a democratic cause if it would somehow benefit the west at the expense of great power rivals, but I'm open to hearing opposing views.",BrokkenArrow,234,469,0.6399999856948853,0.1259771684700774,1695059287,/r/changemyview/comments/16m25zs/cmv_farleft_tankie_media_is_harmful_to_democracy/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-18 17:48:07

16i2l1y,CMV: The far left overall does not have more compassion and empathy towards others than those to the right of them,"One thing I've noticed, in many conversations with far leftists, is that I often feel like a worse person afterwards. Like sure, maybe logically my ideas are sound (sometimes), but I just don't have that level of empathy and compassion that they do. The level of compassion and empathy that would make it so when I walked by a homeless person living on my street my first reaction was  ""I'm so happy that they are able to camp on my street, but lots more needs to be done they are suffering"" and not ""are they going to ask me for money, are they sane, are they violent."" And then I would feel actual joy upon seeing them. 

And I feel like this is an idea the far left has perpetuated- that they are the most caring and compassionate and empathetic. Maybe not the most logical always, but the most emotionally connected to others. And they are able to present all sorts of whacky ideas under the guise that they are superior in this way. And the anger you see when somebody challenges them- well that's natural they are so deeply connected to the suffering person that they feel the pain for the other person. 

But I think, if anything, the far left overall is less compassionate and less empathetic than their more moderate counterparts. Many of them are in their most self centered years (college students namely.) They tend to be more hostile towards opposing ideas. Less able to handle criticism. More willing to act out. Traits that are more closely associated with vulnerable self centered ness, not empathy and compassion. Some of the worst people I've met, people who valued power, were also very far to the left. 

My general view is that the extreme left and extreme right have less compassion and empathy for others, but according to the extreme left people to the right of them have less empathy and compassion than them. 

Obviously my view concerns groups, not individuals. I think the far left as a group wants to appear more empathetic and compassionate, but I don't think they actually are.

16ujn7u,CMV: Israel and Palestine are both victims of bad actions by Arab countries,"Time is 1948, Britain decide they had enough and pull out of the middle-east, dividing the land between Israel and Palestine, under the ""UN Partition plan"". 

Israeli government accepts and declares independence. Palestine government rejects and declares war on Israel. Surrounding Arab countries: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria - declare war on Israel and invade both Israel and Palestine. 

Short version, the war ends with Jordan ruling the West Bank (most of modern day Palestine), Egypt ruling the Gaza strip (Southern Palestine where Hamas is ruling today), Israel surviving and leading an offensive campaign with territorial gains. 

Biggest losers of the war, and the reason for the crisis today: 750,000 Palestinians expelled, no more Palestine. 

Israel was fighting an existential war, so while I cannot justify the atrocities, I can imagine doing whatever is necessary to survive. But Egypt and Jordan were under no circumstances at risk of being invaded by Israel, yet they decided to take advantage of the war and expand into the two most significant areas of today's Palestine. 

The crazy thing is that both Egypt and Jordan made peace with Israel, but never took responsibility for what they did to the Palestinians in 1948.

Imagine a world where the Arab countries don't invade Israel/Palestine in 1948. Israel is not in existential war and can behave rationally. And Palestine is not forced into an all-out war with Israel by its Arab neighbors. This ends with peace, I think.

16lkv3o,CMV: It's morally wrong for a pregnant woman to neglect her health if carrying to term.,"I believe it's not just irresponsible, but morally wrong for a pregnant woman to disregard her physical health if she plans to give birth. 

Of course if it's her body it's her choice, but as soon as you decide you want to bring the baby to term, that's no longer a valid statement. It becomes two bodies that you're fully responsible to care for. 

I'm not just talking about smoking or drinking. I think you have an moral obligation to do basic exercise and eat healthy, nutritional foods, if a human being is developing inside of you and relies on your actions.

Not to say can't occasionally eat a sugary snack when you're craving something. But if you're stuffing your face with fast food and candy all day, and not doing any physical activity, you're directly harming yourself and more importantly, your child. 

During pregnancy, a fetus is at its most vulnerable point of development. Every cell that makes up it's body is coming from what you injest. Living an unhealthy lifestyle while pregnant can result in a lifetime of problems for the child.

Every pregnant woman should feel morally obligated to put their child before their own desires, just as every parent should after they're born.",CheeseIsAHypothesis,91,513,0.5600000023841858,0.1180410607356715,1695008657,/r/changemyview/comments/16lkv3o/cmv_its_morally_wrong_for_a_pregnant_woman_to/,2023,9,changemyview,2023-09-18 03:44:17
16mswb7,CMV: Whiteness is largely an illusion,"The whiteness illusion is the idea that we can mark any point between different ""races"" and think, or behave as though, there is some significant underlying difference, some difference that should matter to us, between those ""races.""

There are three proofs that I know of, that it is an illusion, and probably others I don't.

1) half a million years ago, every single one of my ancestors was black... and that is true of every single living human being.  If black is real, we're all black right now.  If you go by the one drop rule.

2) if we run the one-drop rule in reverse, and make one drop of white blood evidence of whiteness, it would change everything, and be totally arbitrary.  And so it's clearly fictitious.

3) geneticists tell us, and I believe them, that genetic variability within ""races"" is far higher than variability between them.

Now when I say whiteness is LARGELY an illusion, I'm adding in the knowledge that, in fact, some populations left Africa at different times a long time ago, and their geographic situations and circumstances (evidently) produced small but real genetic differences in the populations.  And so appearance provides a certain amount of real evidence of geographic and circumstantial differences in ancestral populations.

16n1skp,CMV: Lauren Boebert's most profitable career move right now is to actually launch an OnlyFans page,"With the attention this video has received coupled with her dwindling hopes for a meaningful position in the Republican party, I believe Lauren Boebert has a huge opportunity to mimic the success Joe Rogan made through podcasting by launching an OnlyFans page and embracing adult content creation.  I base this off the following:

1.  She nearly lost her last election and likely has a more difficult one coming up where she's probably lost a significant amount of support after this fallout. Losing her Congressional seat could be the end of her tenure in DC which also diminishes her national profile. 
2. Politically she seems to be in a hole that may only be put past her by becoming Trump's VP. It's possible Trump would enjoy the optics of being next to her on the campaign trail (and I mean this in a literal sense since it seems insiders have labeled MTG to ugly for him) but I think this is a long shot.
3. Sex work has never been more accepted in this country and it's possible Boebert abandoning politics could quickly win people over by championing the legitimacy of adult content. This kind of brand change would get massive attention and be the wind behind her new platform. This country loves giving celebrities second chances and there are PR firms that could turn her into a folk hero in just a few weeks. 
4. I can tell you as a matter of fact that there is nothing more non-partisan than a penis and you are in denial if you don't think people from every political affiliation would not be interested. The amount of interest and money she would bring in would be astounding right now and may be an easier and less stressful career for her.

16zl0f3,"CMV: Most Biden Supporters aren't voting for Biden because they like him or his policies, they just hate Trump and the GOP","Reuploaded because I made an error in the original post

As Joe Biden and Donald Trump are signifcant favourites to lead both their respective parties into the 2024 election. So I think it's fair to say that the 2024 US election will be contested between these 2 candidates. I know Trump is going through some legal issues, but knowing rich, white billionaires, he'll probably be ok to run in 2024  
  
Reading online forums and news posts has led me to believe that a signifcant portion of those who voted for Biden in 2020, and will vote for him again 2024 aren't doing so because they like him and his policies, but rather, they are doing so because they do not support Donald Trump, or any GOP nomination.  
  
I have a couple of reasons for believing this. Of course as it is the nature of the sub. I am open to having these reasons challenged  
  
\-Nearly every time voting for Third Parties is mentioned on subs like r/politics, you see several comments along the lines of ""Voting Third Party will only ensure Trump wins."" This seems to be a prevailing opinion among many Democrats, and Biden supporters. I believe that this mentality is what spurs many left wingers and centrists who do NOT support Biden into voting for him. As they are convincted that voting for their preferred option could bolster Trump  
  
\-A Pew Research poll (link: https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/election-2020-voters-are-highly-engaged-but-nearly-half-expect-to-have-difficulties-voting/?utm\_content=buffer52a93&utm\_medium=social&utm\_source=twitter.com&utm\_campaign=buffer ) suggets up to 56% of Biden voters are simply voting for him because they don't want Trump in office. It's possible to suggest this is a mood felt among a similar portion of Biden voters, but then again, the poll only had \~2,000 responses. Regardless, I seem to get the feeling that a lot of Biden's supporters are almost voting out of spite for Trump and the GOP.  
  
Here's a CBC article on the same topic (https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-joe-biden-u-s-election-loathing-love-1.5798122)  
  
\-Biden's opinion polls have been poor, very poor. With some sources putting his approval rating as low as 33%, I find it hard to believe therefore that he'll receive votes from tens of millions of Americans because they all love him. Are opinion polls entirely reliable? No. But do they provide a President with a general idea of what the public thinks of then? In my opinion, yes. How can a President gain 270 electoral votes and the majority of the population's support when he struggles to gain 40%+ in approval ratings. For me, this is a clear sign of many people just choosing him not because they like Biden, but because they just don't want the GOP alternative.

Hamas has damaged the reputation of Palestine by targeting civilians, and supporters of a free Palestine would rally far more support if they'd communicate, directly and without concession, the fact that the actions of Hamas were morally reprehensible, without concluding that they were ""necessary"" or, in so many words, that ""Israel had it coming."" Unless the majority of Pro-Palestine individuals *are* indeed Pro-Hamas (which I don't want to just assume flippantly because I have no way of knowing whether or not that's true) I don't understand why more people don't condemn Hamas explicitly instead of responding to the attack on Gaza with Pro-Palestine sentiments.

17a59kt,"CMV: hating children as a whole is weird, evil, and sociopathic.","As someone who is currently childfree (I'm 23 and I don't plan on having children for at LEAST 6-7 years), and as someone who knows people who are permanently childfree for a variety of reasons, I believe that people - childfree or otherwise - who proclaim to **hate** children have sociopathic tendencies. In my opinion, it's one thing to be staunchly child free and to not be good with kids, even to not necessarily want to or prefer to be around kids for extended periods of time. But to me, it is very concerning and indicative of someone's character if they claim to downright hate children and if they are wishing harm to children, even in a so-called ""joking"" manner. Children are children for a reason - they are defenseless minor members of our society and it's a spoken and unspoken societal requirement for us to protect and subsidize them. 

Practical things aside, every one of us were a child at one point in the past, and many of us don't like to remember or acknowledge the period in our lives when we were quite literally novices to personhood and were trying to figure out how to exist as a human being in a space where the majority of the people around us are much older, taller, and wiser than us. And at a certain threshold, when we were *very* young children, we weren't even old enough to communicate our needs with words, which I'm sure is a very frustrating experience for many kids, if not all of them! I feel that to actively ignore this point about the experience of children is very misguided. 

Like, for those of us who have worked with children or been around kids for extended periods of time in some capacity, it can be VERY taxing and exhausting, and there are many kids who are downright bratty and insufferable. But the latter point is often the fault of the adult(s) in their lives, and to ascribe this feeling of genuine hatred and disdain toward the entirety of a literal protected class - a defenseless and dependent one at that - is very sinister to me and is indicative of either deep unresolved issues from one's own childhood or sociopathic tendencies.

17daxlg,CMV: The Confederate Flag is traitorous.,"I went to Franklin Tennesse (my first time in the ""South"") for 2 days and was surprised by the amount of Confederate flags I saw there. These people are the very people who consider themselves patriots committed to our nation, yet I see the Confederate flag as the biggest symbol of treason in American history. It is a symbol of secession and oppression of American citizens. The Confederacy was literally a group of traitorous Americans who opposed our great Constitution and wanted to separate themselves from the United States. It is also a symbol of defending slavery, but that's a whole other discussion. I have nothing but the utmost respect for our country and its Constitution, and see the Confederate flag as a symbol of direct opposition to these institutions. Man say the flag is a symbol of Southern heritage and identity. Shouldn't the beautiful stars and stripes of the American flag be a symbol of their heritage and identity? I just find it peculiar NO OTHER REGION in the US is committed to a symbol of their ""regional identity"" like the South is. I live in California, but nobody is saying ""fuck yeah we're the bear state!"" NOBODY! We don't particularly emphasize our state flag here, and I don't think any other region is like that either, whether it be the Midwest, Pacific Coast, New England, or the Middle Atlantic.

A point I'd like to bring up is why immigrants who display the flags of their mother country is not treasonous in comparison. The South has strong regional ties to the US. Many immigrants have strong regional ties to their home countries. Additionally, their flags (even the flags of Vietnam and Iran) are not inherently symbols of anti-Americanism, while the Confederate flag literally is.",RealFee1405,1826,1935,0.8100000023841858,0.5418819905449734,1697918170,/r/changemyview/comments/17daxlg/cmv_the_confederate_flag_is_traitorous/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-21 19:56:10
17du96r,CMV: Paternity tests should be done on every baby by default,"Just saw a post on r/relationship_advice where the mother gave birth to a baby that looked nothing like her husband, refused to give him a paternity test because it was ""humiliating"" AND also revealed that she had recently refused to end a (pretty weird) friendship with a coworker that her husband was uncomfortable with. She then proceeds to be all ""Surprised Pikachu-faced"" when he thinks she cheated on him with said coworker, refuses to help with the baby, and him and his family start treating her badly. (he continued to help with their 2 other kids as normal, though)

In the end, the mother FINALLY gets that paternity test, proving once and for all that the kid was indeed his, and once she does, the father gets ALL OVER his daughter, hugging and giving her all his love, as I'm sure he would have done from the very begining, had she just gotten that damn test done sooner.

Some of the points that resonate with me the most on this issue are:

* It still baffles me that this test isn't standard procedure, especially when we already draw blood from newborns and screen them for a whole slew of diseases upon delivery. Surely it wouldn't be too hard to add a simple paternity test to the list!
* I know there's an implication of mistrust that comes with asking your partner for a paternity test, but if it became standard procedure - in other words, a test that the hospital does ""automatically"", with no need for parental input - that would completely remove that implication from play. It would become a non-issue.
* Having a kid is a life-changing event, and it scares me to no end to know that I could be forced into ""one-eightying"" my life over a baby I actually played no part in making.
* Knowing your family's medical history, from both sides, is extremely important. ""Mommy's little secret"" could cost her child dearly later on in life.",Guialdereti,1076,2432,0.6100000143051147,0.531565426660673,1697984144,/r/changemyview/comments/17du96r/cmv_paternity_tests_should_be_done_on_every_baby/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-22 14:15:44
17c4l2c,CMV: There's nothing political about young men who can't get laid,"You may think that the title of this post sounds a bit strange.  Let me explain. 

  
If you have ever read anything over at r/purplepilldebate, you’ll know that a lot of the young men posting there are complaining that they can’t find a girlfriend because, in their view, women make illogical and unjust decisions when choosing a romantic partner. This may or may not be true but I want to point out that I feel for these guys.  I was an “incel” myself back in the late 1990s before that term was coined and I was super frustrated.  But if think what’s going on here is that these young men are confusing their struggles to get laid with other past struggles against injustice that were more political in nature. 

  
Let’s take the civil rights struggle of African Americans or women’s lib or mainstream acceptance of LGTBQA.  In each case there were policy decisions that could be made to right the wrong: ending Jim Crow, removing barriers from women entering the workplace, legalizing same-sex marriages, etc.  And there were also efforts that could be made to change people’s attitudes about these oppressed groups: calling out cops for profiling black men, addressing rampant sexual harassment, not using homosexual pejoratives, etc. 

  
But in the case of young heterosexual men who can’t find a partner, there’s nothing to be done at the societal level.  Choosing a sexual partner is a highly subjective personal decision.  There’s nothing logical or fair about it.  Yes, people do sometimes choose horrible partners.  This is not a man thing or a woman thing or a gay thing or a straight thing.  It’s a human thing.  This is why there’s about 2000 years of poetry and music about heartache and loss. It’s a fundamental part of being a person.

    
And you can’t tell women that they must choose men who are under 5’7” because it’s not fair that they have a harder time dating anymore than you can tell a man that he has to date a woman who is 400 pounds.  It’s a person isn’t attracted to someone there’s really nothing to be done about it.    
Many will say, “but in the past men had a much easier time finding partners, and then feminists wrecked everything!”, or something like that.  This is nonsense.  Again, there’s nothing political about how dating works.  

  
American men are having a harder time dating these days because we live in a super affluent society with a mega abundance of choice.  This means that yes, if you use dating apps, women are going to be more picky because they can be.  Biological women, particularly in their early adulthood, have a lower sex drive than biological men.  If you put a bunch of photos of men in front of them, they are going to choose less of them to date than if you put a bunch of photos of women in front of men.  Sorry.  That’s just how it is. 

  
But technology is stacked against young men dating in other ways too.  Because of the internet, lots of horny young males spend hours and hours looking at porn or playing video games instead of going out and meeting people which would, you know, increase their chances of getting laid.  But that takes effort and it’s a little bit scary so it’s not hard to understand why so many are choosing instead to just stay home and masturbate.  

  
I really think it’s just that simple.  I feel kinda sorry for these guys but I don’t think there’s anything to be done about their plight at the societal level.  Anyone want to change my view?

173bl6u,"CMV: If there is a God, it's unfair for Him to sentence unbelievers to Hell as punishment when there are 4,000 religions in the world and it's impossible for someone to discern which one is correct.","Disclaimer: I'm only familiar with Christianity, and have some vague understanding of the other two Abrahamic religions (Islam and Judaism.) I know almost nothing about any other religion. So I cannot give adequate coverage of the other religions, all the more so given that 4,000 religions exist. I can only paint with a broad brush.

One central teaching of Christianity is that those who die unsaved will be suffer in Hell as their rightful outcome for not believing in Jesus as Lord and Savior. (Now, of course, many Christian denominations have different interpretations, but that's the overall gist of it.) 

And one argument that many Christians use is, ""God has made His existence clear and obvious to all, along with salvation, so we have no excuse on the day of Judgment.""

Indeed, a Bible verse, Romans 1:20, even says that explicitly: ""People are **without excuse** (for not believing in and knowing God.)""

Islam says similar things; that hell awaits the unbelievers.

The problem with all this, of course, is that 1) even if God exists, His existence is not obvious at all - the very fact that mankind has been debating His existence for millennia proves that it's not obvious - and 2) there are thousands of religions in the world. How are we supposed to know which one is correct?

To add a third point, **what religion one believes in is heavily influenced by geography and one's local culture.** If you were born in Iraq, you're almost certainly going to be a Muslim; if you were born in the Bible Belt in the USA, chances are you'll be a Christian, if you were born in Thailand, you'll likely be Buddhist, if you were born in India, you'll likely be Hindu, etc. So how is someone who was born in Iraq supposed to correctly ""deduce"" that Jesus is the one true Lord any more than someone born in Oklahoma or Alabama is supposed to think that Allah is god?

So the viewpoint I would be open to being changed is this: T**here isn't sufficient evidence for any one religion - out of 4,000 - to clearly and obviously stand out as the correct one - if religion is even the correct way to go at all (how do we know atheism isn't the right path?) And as such, it is unfair for God to throw someone into Hell for not drawing the correct religion-lottery number - correctly choosing the one out of 4,000.**

17d53a0,CMV: People who don’t have kids will be worse off in old age,"I currently work in a nursing home and have some hospital experience from school and ever since I started this past year I’ve never  really realized how much older people without families struggle. 

Many older people develop serious health conditions and once you’re a senior if you don’t have a family of your own it’s a struggle. Most people in this group either have pets which obviously can’t take care of them or a group of friends, neighbours or extended family who is also old.  

At the nursing home I work with many patients without families are just rotting away here until they die, they don’t get adequate care and without family members these people often get poor treatment for years and have their health conditions exacerbated. It’s really just a cruel lonely existence, I actually feel better for patients with dementia because at least they aren’t aware of the state they are in. 

On top of this many patients in that group always tell me about how lonely they have gotten and their biggest regret often being not starting a family because after a certain point most social contacts lose touch or pass away.

I changed my stance on having kids after not wanting them because now I genuinely believe without a family the last portion of your life will likely be complete misery without one.",trevortins,1175,1901,0.6800000071525574,0.4564572821042451,1697902085,/r/changemyview/comments/17d53a0/cmv_people_who_dont_have_kids_will_be_worse_off/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-21 15:28:05
175vrpm,CMV: The “fat acceptance” movement is filled with delusion and entitlement,"Recently I have been seeing more people both on Reddit and other forms of media saying things like “there’s no health problems with being fat” or “fat people are oppressed” or “it’s genetics” or “weight loss is impossible”. They’re all just lying to them selves to avoid any type of responsibility. 

1. There are plenty of problems associated with being fat, being obsese or even overweight increased risk if health problem. There’s nothing more to it. You may not have problems at 20 or 30, but it’ll all go downhill eventually.
2. No, you aren’t oppressed. You made the choices to eat the amount of food you did to get to your size. If you don’t fit in a plane seat, or don’t meet the weight requirements for an activity, no one is required to accommodate you. You get to deal with the consequences.
3. Genetics don’t play that big of a role. Even with PCOS and Endometriosis, it is still possible to lose weight in a healthy way.
4. Calorie counting and a deficit does not mean an eating disorder. There is a safe and PROVEN way to lose weight, a calorie deficit, eating less (while still eating enough, not starving yourself)

Weight loss is completely possible and simple. It may not be easy as it takes will power, but it is possible.

17kkff5,CMV: men should offer women their number instead of asking them for theirs.,"So in our current society we have a few gender norms that are pretty dumb and downright destructive. One of those is that men are supposed to chase and be active while dating. Women on the otherhand are reactive. Pretty much everyone would benefit if we got rid of this dynamic. 

A common issue men face is that women often times give out their number when asked, even if they aren’t actually interested. That means they either never text back or they only text back to be polite. And men are often seen as overly aggressive if they keep texting. 

So here’s my solution; When you approach a woman and want to get to know her, don’t ask her for her number. Offer her your own. That way, she has more agency and it avoids weird situations. If she does text, it’s clear that she’s interested. No games. No weird chasing. Should become the norm honestly. 
Its also in line with empowerment for women. Have them decide whether or not they want to keep contact.",Mr_McFeelie,1634,1478,0.8500000238418579,0.4432448936674246,1698757068,/r/changemyview/comments/17kkff5/cmv_men_should_offer_women_their_number_instead/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-31 12:57:48
172d6zf,CMV: The Israelis - and most people - would behave just like the Palestinians if they were in their shoes.,"The whole Israel-Palestine issue could fill 400 pages; it's one of the thorniest and most complicated political-religious-historical issues in the world. I am not going to pretend that my 400-word post here can do it justice, and I'll preface by saying that anything I post here is, out of necessity, going to have to be gross oversimplification:

 The Israelis frequently condemn the Palestinian side (such as the current ongoing Hamas attack) for terrorist attacks and whatnot - unsurprisingly so, given that Israel is their side (just like how America, of course, condemned the 9/11 attacks.) **But I am not convinced that, if the roles were reversed, that the Israelis would be behaving any differently.**

Say that Israel were squelched and prevented from being a formally-recognized nation state on terms that it wanted (yes, the Palestinians have been offered two-state solutions, but none that they found satisfactory), and also that it was facing continuous blockade, in poverty, were under the control of a much bigger, stronger, richer opponent of the opposing religion, and that this went on for decades with no end in sight. 

I don't believe, for one moment, that the Israelis would say ""Well, we'll just be content and stay like this forever and always pursue peaceful solutions even though we've found that peace gets us nothing."" The Israelis would be doing something just like what Gaza Hamas is doing right now. **And in fact, that's similar to what Israel did, in fact, do. The Lehi (Stern Gang) used terrorist attacks to help get the nation of Israel formed in the first place, back in the 1940s.**

But that's not what this post is about.

Please change my view that the left, the constellation of progressive, egalitarian, and feminist causes has been derelict in providing a counter to the aggrieved victimhood narrative.

It sucks for anyone to be at an uncomfortable temperature, but, logically, it's the people who run hot who should be accommodated.

The options for improving comfort are very limited when you're overheated. A fan can help, but only so far, and there's only so much clothing you can remove before you're making a scene. 

On the other hand, people who are cold can bundle up. They can wear heavier clothes, put on a sweater, or even run a small space heater. 

There's also more health risk for the hot person. Feeling overheated triggers sweating, which can cause rashes and dehydration. Unless it's ridiculously cold, being cold isn't the same kind of health risk.

So, for these reasons, I believe a person who runs hot should be the one accommodated.

174rx2t,"CMV: If your child is going to be permanently disabled, it is selfish to have it","
I’ve noticed several posts on social media lately about parents with disabled children. These children have significant disabilities and will essentially require care throughout their lives.

Most of these posts present the situation from the parents' perspective. They often mention that they were aware their child would have a disability, but they didn't see it as a limitation. They express their commitment to provide their child with as much love and care as necessary to enable a life as normal as possible.

However, these posts rarely discuss the child’s perspective. Having experienced chronic illness myself and spoken to others in similar situations, I understand that while life may be challenging for the average individual, it's exponentially tougher for someone chronically ill. It's a continuous emotional and financial burden. There's a profound quote by Confucius that encapsulates this sentiment:

""A healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one.""

17810uj,"CMV: ""It wasn't real communism"" is a fair stance","We all know exactly what I am talking about. In virtually any discussion about communism or socialism, those defending communism will hit you with the classic ""not real communism"" defense. 

**While I myself am opposed to communism,** I do think that this argument is valid.

It is simply true that none of the societies which labelled themselves as communist ever achieved a society which was classless, stateless, and free of currency. Most didn't even achieve socialism (which we can generally define as the workers controlling the means of production).

I acknowledge that the meaning of words change over time, but I don't see how this applies here, as communism was defined by theory, not observance, so it doesn't follow that observance would change theory. 

It's as if I said: Here is the blueprint for my ultimate dreamhouse, and then I tried to build my dreamhouse with my bare hands and a singular hammer which resulted in an outcome that was not my ultimate dreamhouse. 

You wouldn't look at my blueprint and critique it based on my poor attempt, you would simply criticize my poor attempt.

I think this distinction is very important, because people stand to gain from having a well-rounded understanding of history, human behavior, and politics.

17925sm,"CMV: If Palestine was ""free"" it would be a ethno-fascist hellscape, and a single-state solution is only marginally better","When you ask, fundamentally, what the hordes of people in the west protesting against Israel really want for the region,  most will, when pressed, eventually acknowledge they dont actually want their public demand of a two state solution along 1967 borders with land swaps.   This is actually pretty explicit from the ubiquitous protest chant ""From the River \[Jordan\] to the Sea \[Med\], Palestine must be free"", which clearly requires the conception of Israel to cease to be.

So what they are really arguing for is a single state solution.    Let's be incredibly generous and give them the benefit of the doubt and suggest that the single state is created without genocide, and protects both Jews and Muslims (and Christians, Atheists, even, gasp, apostates) equally.   What happens? 

Well, since the 650-700k Palestinians left their homes in what was the Mandate of Palestine (at least partly at the urging of the Arab state neighbours massing troops on the borders in anticipation of invasion), a lot of time has past and now there's upwards of 6m+ refugees and their descendants (fun fact, when counting Palestinian refugees for official purposes only patrilineal descendants count- score 1 for the patriarchy!  Possibly a further 2-3m more people can claim descendance from Palestinian refugee antecedents).

Assuming a decent proportion of this number exercised a right to return or a right to citizenship, combined with existing populations in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israeli Muslims, would give the new unitary Levant state a significant Muslim majority.

But what would that population be like?   Well, polling of Palestinian refugees is pretty clear on what they would vote for - hardline Islamists, most likely full jihadis.   The charter of Hamas (approval rate: 60%) expressly calls for driving the Jews into the sea, and half of Gazans actively support this goal.  Several more extreme groups have higher approval rates (Lion's Den: 75%)

In a two state solution, its obvious that the Palestinian state would elect a government extremely hostile to their Jewish neighbour.  Anyone who says different is deluded; their argument usually goes ""Palestinian hostility to Israel is Israels fault - if the occupation ended they'd have no reason to continue to be hostile"".   This ignores how Jews are treated in the world's Muslim majority states. Try being an apostate or Jew in Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.   Even Turkey.   It's hard to imagine a Palestinian state, whose population would be in large less educated, more hardline, poorer and more religious than those of any of those states, would somehow fulfil the progressive wet dreams of the pro-palestine protesters.  Much more likely any Palestinian state would be fun by violent religious extremists that make the Taliban look liberal.   Women would not be educated,  Polygamy (which is legal in Gaza) and corporal punishment would be commonplace. Apostasy would be punished by death (as it is expressly in 9 other Muslim majority states).   Borders with Israel would need to remain locked down to avoid constant violent clashes.  Travel between Gaza and the West Bank would have to remain extremely tightly proscribed (unless someone builds a tunnel!)

In a single state solution, you import all these problems into a state which needs to represent the interests of two utterly dissimilar populations.   It's hard to imagine how this would work, perhaps some kind of strictly enforced apportioned (but not proportionate) representation, constitutional safeguards with supermajority requirements etc..  Even then, it's likely there would be distinct local government (perhaps a federated republic?) of different Jewish and Palestinian areas of the state, and this is where things would get sticky.    Would the federal state be able to mandate Israeli-style anti discrimination laws, e.g. based on gender,  or for example outlawing Polygamy, when this is a normal part of life for many Palestinians?   How would Shariah law, which Palestinians are governed by, interact with this Federal law?   

Ultimately as Palestinians who have emigrated return en masse and (due also to much higher birth rates), the small Muslim majority in the unitary state would become an overwhelming one.  Constitutional safeguards are suddenly increasingly under threat and federal politics will remain deadlocked between two totally mis-aligned factions.  Pressure to take from the wealthy former-Israelis and give to the poor former-Palestinians would be overwhelming.  Public conflict between sectarian groups would be inevitable.

16y3qhp,"CMV: Conservatives decide which viewpoint to hold on an issue by first checking to see which stance liberals are holding, and then automatically opposing it.","This sort of viewpoint is impossible to prove, given that there are no surveys or polling on the issue (and even if there were, there's no way to get people to respond honestly,) so it's simply my hunch, and I'm open to people changing my mind on it.

There are many issues in politics today - particularly Ukraine and Covid - on which it's pretty clear that the only, or main, reason that conservatives are opposing Thing XYZ is simply because they see liberals supporting Thing XYZ.

Let's use Covid first. At the beginning of the Covid pandemic, many conservatives actually went along with the pandemic protocols, and America actually saw a brief dip in infections (this is around the March 2020 time.) That's because Covid hadn't become ""politically sorted out yet."" 

But as time went on, and mask-wearing and social distancing became seen as a ""liberal"" thing to do, conservatives thought, ""Okay, now that libs are doing it, we have to start opposing it, otherwise we wouldn't be conservatives"" and so they started opposing vaccines, masks, distancing - for no good reason other than that libs were doing it and they felt ""If Team Blue does it, then Team Red must oppose it."" There was no **inherent** reason why conservatives should assist a virus' spread and see America suffer heavy death tolls, other than that the libs were fighting against the virus. 

Same with Ukraine. Republican support for Ukraine was actually quite strong at first, around March 2022. But as time went on, and supporting Ukraine became seen as a ""Democratic"" thing to do, conservatives began opposing it. Bear in mind, again, that there's no **inherent** reason why conservatives should oppose helping Ukraine - not only was the cost of doing so extremely cheap, but historically, opposing Russia has been the Republican stance - just look at Ronald Reagan, the ""The-Soviet-Union-is-an-Evil-Empire"" president. So, again, with Ukraine, it was a case of conservatives watching liberals supporting Ukraine and thinking, ""Hmmm, if they support it, we must oppose it.""

I'd even go so far as to say that **if liberals had opposed Covid anti-virus measures and opposed helping Ukraine, that conservatives would then, reflexively, have supported those anti-virus measures and supported Ukraine - out of sheer opposition to Team Blue.**

So, that's the stance I am trying to get changed - that many (but not all) conservatives today, especially the Marjorie Taylor-Greene type, are not basing their stance off of any true principle or pillar of reason, but rather, simply because they automatically oppose whatever Team Blue supports - even if Team Blue is supporting something that's **good**.

179e0bf,"CMV: Israel over decades has shown its willingness give back land for peace. In turn, there cannot be peace until Palestinians accept that Israel isn't going anywhere and are willing to make compromises.","The Palestinians have been offered statehood multiple times and have rejected it everytime because the deal wasn't 100% to their liking. In 1948, they said no. In 1967 Israel offered all of the land it won in war back in exchange for peace, the answer from Arab countries was a resounding ""NO."" Then you have Arafat leading everyone on and then rejecting a reasonable peace offer from Israel.

Eventually you have to wonder if statehood is the goal or something else.

At a certain point, Palestinians will have to recognize that Israel isn't going anywhere and if their ultimate objective is statehood, there has to be some compromise. Israel gave back the entirety of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for peace, a wildly controversial and unpopular move at the time. 

When Israel left Gaza in 2005, it forcibly removed Israeli citizens to let Gazans govern themselves.

 When the goal is great (peace, or statehood), hard and tough decisions must be made. Compromise must be made. After WW2, the Germans lost parts of historic Germany. Like it or not, for peace to exist, when one party starts a war and then loses, they lose leverage and negotiating power and must make compromises if peace is truly the goal. It's been that way throughout history.

Palestinians need to let go of the notion that resistance means the eradication of Israel and that generations of refugees can return. It's simply a fairytale dream at this point. Too many Palestinians, in my opinion, have been brainwashed to believe that this is a feasible outcome -- hence the celebration/support for any and all type of resistance, no matter how gruesome and inhumane.

Meanwhile, in the current conflict, I've yet to see a reasonable answer as to what Israel should do instead of attacking Hamas? What other country would allow another entity to break through, murder over 1000 civillians, and then take back over 150 hostages? If the line hasn't been crossed now, then how many more massacres will be needed before people realize that Hamas' stated goal is to destroy Israel?

What is a proportional response to an entity like Hamas who's objective is to eliminate Israel entirely? Am geniunely curious if there is an alternative to war because I sure hope there is.

It's gotten to a level where a persons race dominates my awareness throughout an interaction. It's become too much of a focus, when of course there is so much more to a person than some amalgamated racial milieu of experiences based on the color of their skin.

I think some people would look at this and say that's the point. But I just want to go back to seeing people as people, and let the racial awareness become secondary.

17a6q26,CMV: There's nothing wrong with criticizing Islam,"My view concerns Islam specifically, because nobody seems to take issue with me criticizing any other religion. 

Islam is no better or worse than other religions and like other religions there is plenty that warrants criticism. Like the fact that several passages of the holy book either promote violence or have not been written clearly enough to stop people from interpreting them that way. 

But whenever somebody criticizes Islam today they're often accused of being Islamaphobic. Which is really, from the perspective of those who don't follow Islam just not liking the views of people who have been dead for centuries, which seems completely fine to me and not remotely racist unless somebody dislikes them because they were from the middle east. But the assumption is usually ""this person doesn't like POC."" 

Some people seem to believe that criticizing Islam will lead to hate towards Muslims, esp. Since they're already in the minority. I think the opposite is true- if you refuse to point out clear issues with a given religion and don't let anybody else do it either people start looking for those who will. And the people that they find are the actual threat. Whereas if you say ""this passage about lot's people is encouraging violence against gay people or not written very well so it causes some hardcore followers of Islam to kill gay people...

174gslq,CMV: Israel has no choice but to annihilate Hamas.,"First I want to say what this post isn't about - I am not here to talk about History or what led us to this situation - mostly because it's a much more complex topic than people often realize, but also because I doubt any of you can change my mind regarding the history of the conflict, frankly I believe I heard it all. In my view, the fact is that there are over 10 Million people from both sides that have nowhere else to go and have to learn to live with each other, the history of the conflict just doesn't matter all that much. 

For context, there are at least 900 dead and over a hundred taken captive - most of which are civilians. 
In past conflicts, where the number of deaths were limited to few dozens at most, and the sense of security of the general populace wasn't severely damaged - the government could easily contain the conflict. They would shoot down a few weapon caches, and killed a few Hamas opperatives to show they mean business, but essentially they didn't change the geopolitical situation, colleteral damage was limited, and it was only a matter of time until the next conflict.

Now that Hamas killed so many, and essentially proved without a shadow of a doubt that they are the Islamic terrorists Israel has always feared, there is just no way the geopolitical situation can remain the same - I mean if they were actually the freedom fighters they claim to be, they could have decided to target military targets and spared the hundreds of civilians that ran for their lives. The sense of security Israelis had is long gone, and there is no way the country can just let it go - add to that the fact that Iran and Hezbollah are watching, can Israel really afford showing the rest of its enemies that it just doesn't care about something of this magnitude? 

Now, here's why I want my mind changed - overthrowing Hamas government in Gaza will result in many, many deaths. Since understandably, Israel cares more about its citizens and soldiers than the Gazans - they will carpet bomb entire neighborhoods to minimize deaths when going in for ground assaults. 
Keep in mind that Hamas leaderships are based in bunkers, and that any Gazan could be a terrorist waiting for them as far as Israel is concerned. 

I really don't see a realistic way for Israel to handle this situation that doesn't involve tons of collateral damage. And as sad as it makes me, I honestly don't feel like I care anymore - not because it isn't horrible, but because I don't think there is much of a choice here. Hamas has to be annihilated, and the collateral damage is a given, especially when Hamas goes out of its way to put civilians in harms way.

My only hope here is that this war will result in turning Gaza into more of Japan after pearl Harbor, rather than it turning to Afghanistan after 9/11. I still don't see an alternative choice either way.",Hatook123,174,1500,0.6000000238418579,0.2678065220193174,1696929628,/r/changemyview/comments/174gslq/cmv_israel_has_no_choice_but_to_annihilate_hamas/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-10 09:20:28
176cb77,CMV: CEOs are not special talents that deserve tens of millions,"I was reading another thread that made some pretty good points about a CEOs value, but they only barely seem to hold up due to circumstance, and I hope there's more to it.

People wrote that top CEOs are tireless workers, who dedicate their entire life to the success of an entity. That may be true, but tons of regular people do this. One huge example are the millions of poor families that have individuals who sacrifice most of their waking hours to ensure some quality of life for their dependents. This behavior is not even minimally unique to top CEOs. Furthermore, executive positions rarely have any meaningful personal financial stakes, or otherwise (they already made it). The main reason for their absurd pay, appears to be because they are allowed to dictate it, and that societies prioritize shareholders over laborers. If laborers were protected and prioritized, it would be seemingly impossible to justify an absurd CEO salary.

I have also read that CEOs successfully manage tons of important relationships, and have to make enormous decisions every day. This is also not unique to top CEOs. Again, I will use a common example with higher personal stakes, which are working poor families. The working poor often have to succesfully deal with tons of people who have power over THEM (often sociopaths), under the threat of homelessness, daily. Their decisions and sacrifices are what make every difference for them and their families. CEOs have entire teams dedicated to making their decisions easier. The important relationships that CEOs manage are likely people with mutual interests, from the same absurd social class (low personal stakes in terms of financial security), which is hardly the most testing thing one can imagine.

Another thing I read is that CEOs tie together a lot of expertise from different departments. This is also not unique and even less special, in light of the people who manage the actual products and projects that truly define the success of a large company. In a large company, the departments must surely be connected by much more than an individual. A large successful company always looks more likely to succeed in spite of an owner, or CEO (Twitter), than it is to be helped in any way that isn't hollow, or related to perceptions. The stock market is seemingly ruled in large part by perception, and the directive is already built in, which is to make more money and cut costs. The CEO would be the friendly face that they know, and who makes the investors feel better. Someone who will pull the trigger on those nasty directives, and look good doing it, but not much more. If that's most of it, how does the position deserve 400 percent more than anybody?

I feel like the only reason this absurdity thrives, is the stock market. A market which is largely incoherent, needing regulation, and way too big to fail. The modern CEO seems to be the clown steward of our system's broken promises, and a vestige of our monotheistic worldview, but not some special genius.

I would love to know of any reason that a CEOs vast inequality makes sense, outside of a greedy/emotional stock market, and the directive for infinite growth that apparently needs a friendly/confident face to execute it. They really do seem to me to just be a bad person, that can market themselves as a good person, and push some dark directives, while only concerning themselves with initiatives that support those directives. It would be nice not to feel that shitty about all of it.

Another example that was used in the other thread was Messi, the soccer player, getting paid much more than others. But Messi represents labor and the object of consumption, not administration, so that doesn't work.",bohrmachine,1236,701,0.8299999833106995,0.2667644314252641,1697131293,/r/changemyview/comments/176cb77/cmv_ceos_are_not_special_talents_that_deserve/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-12 17:21:33
16zs8ww,CMV: White people can experience racism.,"

Just wanna say, yes I am white. No, I do not think I am marginalized or attacked in any way, and I know that I am automatically privileged in the US as a white male. I don’t think it should be that way, but I recognize that I have privilege inherently.  

I’m my gender studies class, it was brought up that men cannot experience sexism and that white people cannot experience racism. Our professor said it’s because for something to be racism, it has to be directed at a marginalized group. Obviously white people are not marginalized, so the argument I guess is that you can’t be racist towards them. 

Did the definition of racism change at some point? I always saw it as racism being simply treating somebody worse because of their race. I know that barely ever happens to white people, but if somebody treats a white person worse because they are white, is that not racist? 

I know this probably doesn’t seem like the best thing for a white person to be saying, sort of me saying “I matter too! I can experience racism too!” But looking at it from a purely outside perspective, is racism not just treating somebody differently because of their race, no matter what that race is?",owenja104,383,1243,0.699999988079071,0.2512100494659532,1696438100,/r/changemyview/comments/16zs8ww/cmv_white_people_can_experience_racism/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-04 16:48:20
17f6fkz,CMV: No one should support Palestine,"There's quite a bit of posts about the conflict but if you're here then you're interested!

Quick note: I am not saying we should not support PalestiNIANS (the people), what they're going through is a horrendous nightmare

Anyway, I want to quickly say what I think I know so that if I'm mistaken it can be pointed out:

- Israel took over most of the surrounding land including what some argue rightfully belong to Palestine, and that this was a long time ago
- This conflict has lasted years and several battles, with the current one being yet another fight for Palestine to take their land back
- However, Israel has tried around 5 times to come to a peaceful agreement (involving the UN at some point) about these lands which have been rejected by Palestine every time
- Lastly, the initiators of today's conflict are literal terrorists

Ok and this is why I hold my view:

- First of all, Palestine begun this conflict (again). Why is anyone supporting the perpetrator of a war that has already caused so much destruction and murder of innocent people
- Also, these were TERRORISTS!!! There's a group in my home country that are similar to Hamas, and if they ever pulled something like this I would never support my country... yet so many support this.
- Israel has had this land for a decently long time, why is Palestine still fighting for it? They're clearly militarily inferior and can't protect it, they should be taking a peace treaty at all costs
- I understand the implications of the land being controlled by Israel (Economic troubles and such) but does this really justify the killing of thousands of innocent people?
- Lastly, it seems Israel is launching a counterattack that to me seems to be fair, they keep getting attacked for the same thing so it's time to shut off Hamas for good. Hamas uses civilians to protect itself while Israel seems to just want to protect its people whatever the cost.

I understand that because of the recent border blockage many Palestenians do not have access to food which is very unjust and horrible to the innocent people, but this has been a common tactic to pressure governments to stop attacks and converse diplomatically or surrender.

That is all, I'm very open to having my view changed on this matter if I'm persuaded. And just in case this is brought up; I am not from either of these countries or their surrounding areas, and I'm also not originally from any of the countries are actively supporting either side, I hold this view purely out of the information I have provided.",Juanito2Gud,466,1089,0.7799999713897705,0.2360851263522251,1698129525,/r/changemyview/comments/17f6fkz/cmv_no_one_should_support_palestine/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-24 06:38:45
17ez9o9,CMV: The oppressor/oppressed framing that some Progressives use is counterproductive,"This is true for progressives I've met in real life and for progressives online. In my experience, many adhere to a strict worldview where one group is the oppressor and one group is the oppressed. 

It's not that I disagree with the idea that some groups as a whole have more power and influence than other groups. I absolutely do, and I don't think this should be the case. I just don't think this information is remotely useful when it comes to policy. Because the problem you run into is while the group *collectively* has more power, most *individuals* lack any sort of meaningful power. 

So when a policy is proposed that disempowers the oppressor group the individuals at the top who are actually doing almost all of the oppressing are not affected, but rather the people at the bottom who are already lacking power to oppress anybody. So basically people who were already powerless to change anything are losing power they cannot afford to lose. That hardly seems like something to celebrate.

16z86yq,"CMV: I'm extremely suspicious of anyone who opts to homeschool their kids, and really don't think there are many legitimate reasons to do it.","I have seen studies suggesting that home-schooled kids perform better in certain academic fields when compared to non-homeschooled kids. What I haven't seen is a study that indexes this to income, or to two-parent households. Both of those have profound impacts on the likelihood of academic success, and most homeschooling situations require either a very comfortable income, a two-parent household, or both. 

I'm highly doubtful that your average homeschooled child is performing significantly better than if they were in a regular school with parents who took an active interest in their education. 

Meanwhile, I have serious trouble grappling with the impact that this level of isolation and enmeshment might have. I can't help but feel, based on the homeschooling situations I've seen that it leaves kids less fulfilled or socially mature. 

The majority of homeschooling I've seen has been for religious reasons. Now, I attended 13 years of faith-based education. I'm not *entirely* against integrating religious instruction into education on principle, provided it doesn't impede on a child's understanding of basic facts. I *mostly* am, but given it's long history and integration with many education systems I'm more comfortable. 

However, I find it ***especially*** suspicious when your faith leads to that degree of isolation and inordinate levels of control over your child.

Why?  What age range is it ok then? 

In a world where we beg to “let kids be kids” why is a 14 even 17 year old not yet adult is given grief when dressing up, enjoying the outdoors, spending time with friends or family or even alone and getting free candy? 

Isn’t this better than many other possibly delinquent activities they could be doing? Is it too naïve to think that kids who are out causing trouble might be less inclined to smash pumpkins if they didn’t feel it was “uncool” to trick-or-treat and felt more welcomed to participate?

Yes they both had sex, and they both need to be aware that unprotected sex (although its still possible to get someone pregnant if you're wearing a condom) has consequences, but having to care for a child ruins your life.

170sspf,CMV: Life would be much better for the vast majority of us if virtually all workplaces were democratic and cooperatively owned,"Democracy in a workplace looks something like this: all major organizational decisions in an enterprise are determined by a vote among the workers, where each worker enjoys comparable, if not identical, voting power.

Cooperative ownership of a workplace looks something like this: all workers in an enterprise hold a comparable, if not identical, stake in the enterprise. The distribution of profits is determined by worker vote. Sale of personally-held stakes *may* be subject to a vote, such that workers cannot independently sell their stake in an enterprise without permission from the enterprise.

In this way, democracy and cooperative ownership go hand-in-hand. To have one, you need the other. One of the problems this creates at the outset is that of conflicting interests between the worker roles in the enterprise, for example, the conflict of interest between supervisors and subordinates, or between sectors of an enterprise who overvalue their own work at the expense of others.

Democratic co-ops typically solve this problem by rotating workers voluntarily between roles. I'll spend some time talking about this because I consider it essential to the democratic cooperative model.

""Voluntary rotation"" looks something like this: if there are 90 manual jobs and 10 supervisory jobs, but 30 workers wish to take part in supervisory jobs, workers who volunteer for supervisory service are rotated between manual and supervisory roles such that they spend about 1/3rd of their time in supervisory service. Workers who are happy to hold a role for which there is not greater worker demand than slots to fill are not required to rotate out of it. And, of course, what roles exist and the details of how to fill them is determined democratically. There are several upshots to such a system. Here's three that come to mind:

1. workers are no longer defined by their specific job position, but by their individuality as people. You're no longer ""junior technician Carl"", you're ""Carl, who's good at such-and-such.""
2. workers gain holistic insight into the enterprise, enhancing solidarity, cohesion, creativity and empathy
3. workers are trained in several skills, increasing their value and autonomy and diversifying their workplace experience resulting in a more interesting work life

But voluntary rotation creates a concern about specialization: rotating people with no programming experience into programming positions would be a disaster. The danger of such a mistake is mitigated by the collective stake all workers have in the enterprise. Because absurd role allocations would harm everyone, everyone has a stake in preventing these.

A problem facing co-ops in the real world is competitiveness in both growth rate and specialized hiring against private totalitarian enterprises, which are the standard in the world today. This CMV presumes a ""magic wand"" solution that converts virtually all enterprises into co-ops overnight, such that competition against dictatorial enterprises is not a concern.

A problem facing democratic organization, not just of workplaces but in general, is the problem of critical mass. An organization with so many voters that none feel as though their vote matters can suffer from apathy and deliberative inefficiency, and ultimately recreate a quasi-oligarchic power structure (see modern liberal states). This is not so easily solved. If the sizes of co-ops were small enough to ensure every worker can meaningfully vote and contribute to deliberations, these enterprises may not be able to profit as effectively from economies of scale. I'm inclined to believe that the general social uplift of widespread democratic cooperative work will vastly outweigh whatever reduced productivity may come along with it. After all, we find ourselves today facing crises of *overproduction* more than underproduction.

My view could be changed by effective arguments that:

1. Democratic co-ops are so much more inefficient than private totalitarianism that the majority of us would find ourselves less able to meet our needs than we are now
2. Democratic co-ops are inherently unstable and will almost inevitably devolve into either the private totalitarianism we currently have, or something worse
3. Working at a democratic co-op actually sucks harder than working under private totalitarianism
4. Widespread democratic cooperative organization at work would exacerbate negative externalities (for example, climate change.)

My view is not concerned with, and so will not be changed by, arguments that:

1. There's a better way to organize labor than private totalitarianism *or* democratic co-ops (see: ""life would be *better*"")
2. The handful of extremely rich people who prefer the current system would be disenfranchised (see: ""the vast majority of us"")
3. Some enterprises cannot effectively function under the democratic co-op model (see: ""virtually all"")
4. Democratic co-ops cannot grow to see widespread adoption (see: ""magic wand solution"")",qwert7661,354,847,0.699999988079071,0.1825861450676192,1696538643,/r/changemyview/comments/170sspf/cmv_life_would_be_much_better_for_the_vast/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-05 20:44:03
17ghhot,CMV: Racial tribalism is bad.,"I am Asian American. I am wholly Asian and wholly American, yet I interact with people from various different cultural, religious, ethnic, racial, and national backgrounds on a daily basis. Racial tribalism would be the exact opposite, sticking to one's own racial or cultural group and interacting with people from other racial or cultural groups as minimally as possible, or not at all. As an Asian American, I think my racial group (at least where I live in San Diego) is well integrated with the rest of American society and have friends of many different races or cultural backgrounds. However, it pisses me off that many younger Asian Americans also often defend racial tribalism (which I've witnessed frequently), just because their parents did it despite the fact they don't really engage in racial tribalism themselves. Racial tribalism harms society and us individually, and I'll delve into both here:

Firstly, racial tribalism is a severe impediment to social cohesion. If we try to interact with each other as little as possible, how can we cooperate, innovate, or progress? We become unable to address and fix problems together as a society because of our balkanization. The only way to get shit done is to unite. It also certainly leads to ""othering"" and stereotypes, which are the first steps towards full blown racism. What is especially hypocritical is that the same Asian Americans who defend racial tribalism also complain when we get stereotyped or people are uneducated about our culture. The Nazis and imperial Japanese were racial tirbalists, though of course at a scale not present today. But of course, they didn't start out at that scale either... We become ignorant of the other side, which is especially said to see as I love engaging with and interacting with different cultures. It is very enriching and you learn a lot.

Additionally, it can inhibit us individually. When we (I don't mean specifically Asians, I mean ""we"" just as a pronoun) ""other"" other races, then they will ""other"" us back. This can negatively impact people emotionally. Also, when we interact with as many people as possible regardless of race, our social networking and opportunities increase as a result.

Of course this isn't to mean people can't want to spend time with people of a similar culture, but they should feel comfortable interacting with a larger multiracial society as a whole. I can understand how many groups such as the Chinese, Blacks, Italians, Irish, Jews, Mexicans, Japanese, Arabs, etc were forced to tribalize in the past (in American history), but now is a different time and America is the greatest melting pot in the world and we should not take it for granted.",RealFee1405,771,525,0.8299999833106995,0.1808183754219929,1698273978,/r/changemyview/comments/17ghhot/cmv_racial_tribalism_is_bad/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-25 22:46:18

17idvo4,CMV: Muslims in the west will always prefer their co religionists to their host country,"Maybe this is controversial but this is something I’ve thought for a while. Whenever a tragedy happens in the Muslim world, or whenever Muslims are attacked or their religion is criticised, no matter where it is, Muslims in the west or elsewhere all come together. They band together and they defend one another. Be it in the current israel-Palestine conflict, the persecution of Muslims in China, Kashmir, or protesting sometimes violently over things like Charlie Hebedo Muhammad cartoons. And yet they never do the same when some tragedy hits their adopted country particularly in the west.

Take the UK for example. Muslims here remained silent when Pakistani grooming gangs raped and abused white women across the uk over the last fifty years. I’d they ever spoke about it, it was ti say how this was victimising them. Or in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing, or the stabbing of David Ames (an MP), or the London Bridge terrorist attack. Or the fact that a teacher in the UK had to go into hiding for discussion whether it was right to show a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad. Or when some Muslims  threatened with death a school boy who supposedly scuffed a Quran by accident t and they forced his mother to beg for forgiveness.

Or even recently when after the recent flare up in the ME, we e seen a 1450% increase in anti semitic crime. And yet they’ve usually just kept silent or said it’s to be expected.

They never come out and show any sympathy or horror when these things happen. Instead they often seem to show sympathy with those Muslims who commit these atrocities.

That and the broader incidents mentioned before   me suggests Muslims particularly in the west will never actually try and show any support or dare I say it loyalty to the country they are in if it is not a Muslim country.

17dxz1y,CMV: There’s a lot of thinly veiled anti-semitism in the African American community the Hamas attack has brought to the surface,"Basically what the title says, after thinking on this for some time and looking at the available evidence I think we can come to the conclusion that black Americans don’t see the Jews as an ethnic minority capable of experiencing prejudice and suspicion like themselves.

They see a bunch of (supposedly) rich white people complaining about how hard they have it. Look at r/blackpeopletwitter now. There ain’t no solidarity with the people of Israel after Hamas raped, slaughtered and tortured over a thousand men, women and children. The general mood of the sub, and you can see this just by searching keywords such as ‘Israel’, ‘Jews’ and ‘Hamas’, can be summed up as “sucks to suck. the jews had it coming”. There’s posts over there with thousands of upvotes showing screenshots of twitter where people are saying “What did you think decolonization meant lol? Peaceful protest forever?”, there’s posts with screenshots criticizing the perceived overabundance of sympathy for Israel in America after the attack and that this “clown ass country”, which was the title of the post, was afraid to criticize the alleged “genocide” of the Palestinian people. 

There are verified users in the “country club threads” saying vile stuff about the IDF and the Israeli people, here’s some direct quotes from one. 

> Israeli soldiers are literally thugs and concentration camp guards lol

> they’re engaging in a colonial and white supremacist project 

They’re un-ironically hiding behind the “ANTI-ZIONISM DOES NOT EQUAL ANTI-SEMITISM” defense. Even though without a Zion for Israelites, and this attack proves it, there’s no place where they can be reliably safe from persecution and violence. There was a recent Vox article that made a somewhat passable attempt to explore the topic but the main thrust of the argument was “LOL black people don’t owe jews shit. Get over yourselves and stop thirsting for black people to help validate your cause” which is not only arrogant and self centered but also completely lacking in self awareness. When jews are asking for black people to stand with them, they’re asking not because they want the “black seal” of approval to know their social justice movement is “real”, but because black and white activists actively shamed and cudgeled people who stood on the sidelines during the George Floyd protests instead of advocating for BLM and police reform. 

“Silence is violence” right? Until the people are white I guess. 

I suppose this shouldn’t be too surprising when you consider the rabidly anti-semitic views pushed by Elijah Muhammed, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam more broadly. Now I fully acknowledge that they NOI served vital needs in the black community in the 60’s and 70’s. They offered dignity, self respect, mutual aid in times of trouble and a framework in which black men and women could understand themselves and their place in an extremely racist society. 

But they were also anti-semitic af. And the people that subscribed to those views are still alive today and their views were passed down to their kids and grandkids. Same as racism. It’s why you see little bubbles of anti-semitism pop up here and there like Jay-Z’s line about Jews owning all property in America off his latest album 4:44, actually Jay has a few questionable lines about jews in his discography. Or in a more dramatic fashion, Kanye publicly imploding with his hitler sympathies or black teens burning flags of Israel during the Crown Heights Riot. 

What the Hamas attack has taught me, and what I think people should take away from it, is that black people are just like any other group in America and their awareness and sympathy for a cause drop precipitously the further we get from their people.",nowlan101,202,918,0.6000000238418579,0.1756111063151649,1697994334,/r/changemyview/comments/17dxz1y/cmv_theres_a_lot_of_thinly_veiled_antisemitism_in/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-22 17:05:34

Without strong institutions in these two aspects, the state will soon lapse into dictatorships, authoritarianism and/or totalitarianism. I'm not an expert in either of these areas, so I'm happy to enlightened here, but these Capitalism vs Socialism arguments always seem strange to me. Proponents on both sides always seem to feel like the other system is inherently evil when it seems obvious that there has to be some kind of hybrid model between the two.

172zudm,CMV: Voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all.,"In 2020, only about 2/3 of eligible voters actually voted. According to a survey, of the 1/3 who did not vote, 20% said their reason for not voting was that they did not like the candidates.  
https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/945031391/poll-despite-record-turnout-80-million-americans-didnt-vote-heres-why  
Here is my view: If you do not like either of the main two candidates enough to vote for one of them, you might as well vote for someone else.  
A lot of people say ""a vote for a 3rd party candidate is a vote for (insert name of Democrat or Republican candidate)""  
By definition it is not. It is a vote for someone else. And this argument fails even harder when the voter in question would not otherwise have voted for anyone.  
People say that voting for a 3rd party candidate is meaningless because they won't win. But something interesting happens when a 3rd party candidate gets 5% of the vote. They become eligible for federal funding in the next election.  
https://transition.fec.gov/info/chtwo.htm  
This is certainly not impossible. In 2016, both Clinton and Trump were such immensely terrible candidates that the Libertarian nominee, Gary Johnson, got 3.3% of the vote.  
It's too early to say for sure, but I'd wager both major candidates in 2020 will be astonishingly difficult to vote for.  
So if a potential voter's reaction to whichever two clowns they put at the top of the ballot is to vote for neither of them... why shouldn't they vote for someone else instead?  
This is not to say that an undecided voter should necessarily vote 3rd party instead of trying to figure out which of the major candidates is the 'lesser evil'. My statement is only that voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all.  
In an ironic twist, due to the way the electoral college works, in deep red or deep blue states, voting for a 3rd party candidate may influence the result of the election more profoundly than voting for one of the two main candidates. One vote can be the difference between a major party receiving 88% or 88.0001% of the vote in a particular state... or it can be the difference between a third party receiving 4.99999999% or 5% of the vote nationwide.",LaserWerewolf,433,631,0.7799999713897705,0.15678335002242,1696773607,/r/changemyview/comments/172zudm/cmv_voting_for_a_3rd_party_candidate_is_more/,2023,10,changemyview,2023-10-08 14:00:07

Before that the area was part of Ottoman Syria.

However the idea of establishing a safe haven on a piece of land due to anscestory is questionable at best, especially when the land requires a form of reconquering.

If the Jewish people want a safe homeland they could establish it anywhere, especially as historically the Jewish people were wandering nomads, originating from 12 tribes who did not have a homeland but lived as desert nomads in bedouin style tents.

This will ultimately increase offer, and then an ""economic loop"" can start, powered only earth's resources and capitalist market  relations. One does not need a PHD in mathematics to see how easily this can turn the numbers into the depletion of the original resource, ultimately privating ALL humanity of its benefits. Saying this is an idealization of reality is far from the cold facts: we are constantly transforming _clean air_ into _pollution and factories_, _energy_ into _power and an increase in temperature_, _free land_ into _urbanization and population growth_...

17277c9,"cmv: The US population of foreign born people, regardless of legal status, has fluctuated between 5 and 15% for over a century. The current so called “crisis” is a bigoted myth.","We have always had a thriving community of foreign born people here in the US, which has fluctuated for the last century between 5 and 15% of the over all population.

This current so called “crisis” myth is also nothing new. There has always been a vocal segment of the US who blame immigrants for every single social challenge from the economy to drugs and crime. 

For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime.

https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/mythical-tie-between-immigration-and-crime

I lived in a border community for 12years that had upwards of 80% Spanish speaking immigrants of every sort of legal status. They are no different than any other segment of the US.

The current “crisis” in the US is born of nothing less than thinly varnished bigotry.

Furthermore large segments of the US economy are utterly dependent on immigrant labor to perform work that Americans simply will not do. We’re we to actually enforce the current prohibitions we have on the books the results would be catastrophic.

17llow9,"CMV: Conservatives do not, in fact, support ""free speech"" any more than liberals do.","In the past few years (or decades,) conservatives have often touted themselves as the party of free speech, portraying liberals as the party of political correctness, the side that does cancel-culture, the side that cannot tolerate facts that offend their feelings, liberal college administrations penalizing conservative faculty and students, etc.

Now, as a somewhat libertarian-person, I definitely see progressives being indeed guilty of that behavior as accused. Leftists aren't exactly accommodating of free expression. The problem is, I don't see conservatives being any better either.

Conservatives have been the ones banning books from libraries. We all know conservative parents (especially religious ones) who cannot tolerate their kids having different opinions. Conservative subs on Reddit are just as prone to banning someone for having opposing views as liberal ones.  Conservatives were the ones who got outraged about athletes kneeling during the national anthem, as if that gesture weren't quintessential free speech. When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he promptly banned many users who disagreed with him. Conservatives have been trying to pass ""don't say gay"" and ""stop woke"" legislation in Florida and elsewhere (and also anti-BDS legislation in Texas to penalize those who oppose Israel). For every anecdote about a liberal teacher giving a conservative student a bad grade for being conservative, you can find an equal example on the reverse side. Trump supporters are hardly tolerant of anti-Trump opinions in their midst.

17now0j,CMV: Leftists/LGBTQ+ people who support Palestine doesn't make sense.,"I'll start by saying I'm from SEA, so my perspective may be incomplete and I may have missing information, but I'll start with what information I think I know:

My understanding is Israel was formed after WW2 to give surviving Jews their own nation. This displaced the Palestinian people and while some do integrate into current Israel, a large number are in Palestine and over several years Israel has treated them badly and displaced them from their homes.

A few months ago Hamas, which my understanding is a terrorist group but is also supported and elected by the majority of Palestinians, launched a cowardly terrorist attack that killed many innocent people.

In response, Israel has acted like the US did after 9/11 and has attacked Palestine relentlessly. 

Since then, I've seen a large population of left leaning and LGBTQ+ people supporting Palestine, as well as rightist nazi 4channers. This confounds me. I expect the nazi 4channer types to support Hamas because they hate jews and Israel, but the other side confuses me.

My understanding is a large amount of palestinians support the terrorist attack, and also a lot of muslims hate LGBTQ+ people and would kill them if they could.

So I don't understand how anyone part of those communities could support people who hate them and would kill them, just because Israel is taking revenge.

I feel like if you do a terrorist attack, you're now in the ""find out"" phase of the ""fuck around and find out"" phase.

Looking for some perspective on why so many leftists support Hamas/Palestine on this. What do they honestly expect Israel to do in response to this attack? If the attack leads to Israel bending the knee, wouldn't that encourage more muslim terrorists to attack Israel? they can't afford to look weak.

I'm open to having my view changed but I do strongly think it's foolish and a case of ""living in an ivory tower"" if you're part of these communities and pledge your support of Palestine/Hamas.",fexterslab,825,3365,0.6100000143051147,0.6561908368042408,1699114064,/r/changemyview/comments/17now0j/cmv_leftistslgbtq_people_who_support_palestine/,2023,11,changemyview,2023-11-04 16:07:44

1858lk8,CMV: Not voting for Biden in 2024 as a left leaning person is bad political calculus,"Biden's handling of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts has encouraged many left-leaning people to affirm that they won't be voting for him in the general election in 2024. Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively.

Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest.

To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.

18624kk,CMV: far-right Muslim extremist organizations like Hamas should be treated the same way we treat far-right Christian extremist organizations.,"Progressive intersectionality has been a net asset for many causes including the struggle of oppressed minorities, women, LGBT groups, etc...

However, in recent times, it has lost its focus by trying to include supporting far-right religious extremists such as Hamas, a terrorist organization, all in the name of intersectionality.

It is mind-blogging that many progressive activists to this day still refuse to condemn Hamas' rape, torture, and beheading of innocent civilians. Some even go so far as to deny that rape and gender-based violence even took place.

**It shouldn't be difficult to stand with innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians while still condemning Hamas' terrorist attacks.**

If a Christian Copt Terror group in Egypt, started to rape, torture, and behead innocent Muslim civilians in the name of Jesus Christ, you can be sure that these same progressive activists would condemn them.

They would ignore the context of the oppression that the Copt minority has suffered at the hands of Egypt's Muslim majority Government and instead, they would only focus on ""Christians killing Muslims"".

But when Muslims kill Jewish people or Christians, many progressive activists refuse to condemn Hamas all in the name of intersectionality.

17q0cl6,CMV: There is no compelling reason to be angry about diversity in media,"Do you ever see those articles or videos of people complaining about ""wokeness"" in media, but they never quite describe what that is? Based on the context, it sounds like they're just complaining about diversity. I think more diversity is a good thing, because the world is diverse. That's just reality.  
  
I love the show Friends, but I'm going to pick on it a bit just as an example. It takes place in New York, and all the main characters are straight white people. Almost all the supporting characters are white people. It isn't very realistic in its portrayal of New York, because the city in reality is not 99% white people.  
  
My point is-- having more diversity makes sense and is more of a good thing than a bad thing. It's a net positive.  
  
Now let's look at some of the arguments these people make:  
  
**""Executives are forcing diversity just to pander.""**  
  
Probably. But executives have always pandered. Their job is to appeal to people in order to maximize profit. Why zero in on diversity as the main cause of this? It's a broader issue of studios chasing the dollar. At least in this case, the result of having more diversity isn't really a bad thing.  
  
**""They sacrifice good writing for diversity.""**  
  
Once again, these are two separate things. I agree that telling a good story should be the focus. Why would diversity have anything to do with this? Why pick out diversity as the thing that is making movies forget to tell a good story? There have always been poorly written movies long before diversity was encouraged.  
  
**""They make unnecessary changes to things we love.""**  
  
Anytime something is brought back for a reboot or new adaptation, there are going to be changes. Not all of these changes will be strictly ""necessary"". As long as you don't have an attitude of being resistant to all change, I don't see why changing something just to be more diverse is a bad thing. Why not instead just blame the changes that actually harm the story and characters? A minor change like a character having a different skin color does not sound harmful to me. It sounds like a very minor change.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
To bring it all together, let's suppose they rebooted Friends with entirely new actors playing the same characters. And none of the acting was good. And they changed the race of one of the the main characters. And the writing was terrible. What would you think of all this? What would you mention in a critical review of it?  
  
I would think rebooting it in the first place is a completely unnecessary cash grab. I would be irritated by how bad the writing is. And I would point out how the new portrayals are not nearly as good as the original cast. So I'd have a lot of criticisms of the reboot, but none of this has anything to do with diversity or being ""woke"". If they decided to make Rachel black, I wouldn't care that the character was black. I would care that the new actor doesn't do as good of a job as Jennifer Aniston.

184bs54,"CMV: creationism should not be taught in public schools at all, even alongside evolution.","I was watching the Simpsons episode where they start teaching creationism alongside (later instead of) evolution in Springfield elementary. It was goofy, but while watching I remembered that my high school did the exact same thing. I went to a decently well-funded public school in the Midwest during the early 21st century. 

At the time I didn’t care all that much, I was raised Christian but I was always a curious kid so I already knew about and believed in evolution. Actually, I did care a little bit because, while on the debate team, I *lost* a debate regarding whether creationism should be taught in schools. So maybe you could say the episode reminded me of some embarrassing high school moments. 

I agree with the Simpsons: creationism should *not* be taught in school because there is no scientific merit to the book of Genesis. Schools are institutions of science and evolution is science. Churches are where children should learn about creationism and how religion squares with our contemporary world. 

Still, as an adult I don’t care all that much, so my opinion can still be subject to change. I lost the debate arguing that creationism should *not* be taught in public schools, so obviously there are valid arguments as to why creationism *should* be taught in schools. 

I should also note, I chose the words in the title carefully. Creationism should not be taught *at all.* In my school it was an option, you could learn about evolution and creationism in tandem. I’m taking a rather extreme position that creationism shouldn’t be taught at all. So maybe change my view so that I can see the merit of teaching them both and giving the option for students. Or change my view that creationism should be taught instead of the evolution hoax.

186p36m,CMV: a Trump 2024 presidency would irreversibly alter United States politics & partisanship as we know it,"Loaded post, I know and this is a bit heady, but please let me explain. I’m from the Midwest and Trump supporters are everywhere. They frequently claim that Trump is being hit with “political” legal attacks during these court cases. They claim this like they’re saying something outrageous. They also act like Trump wouldn’t do the exact same thing against his opponents, or worse if re-elected. 

First off, obviously the cases against trump are completely political. He’s the former president, and I don’t see any republican plaintiffs. However, when I mention politics, I’m looking past the superficial ideological divide and I’m analyzing the actual mechanics and science behind “power” and mass influence. The study of politics is just that, the discipline studying the application of power and exercise of authority. Any system with more than one individual is political because there will be a power imbalance. There cannot be two chefs cooking the same meal unless one delegates. This is power and its political. 

In my view, systems of power become contentious when you have powerful individuals supported by other powerful people, institutions, or undifferentiated masses. Such as a political party. 

Trump is currently being tried for many different alleged violations, both civil and criminal. Trump was a former and recent president of the United States. This dynamic is completely unprecedented in the balance of Anglo-American politics. Trump could have murdered 3 people with a knife on camera and admitted to it and prosecution of him would still be political. It’s inescapable that the act of exercising government power against trump in the form of judicial oversight is an act of political power. It’s irrelevant how much or how little Biden, or any democrat, has to do with any prosecution. Its political no matter what.  Submission to any court and its laws, under any circumstances, is a recognition of political sovereignty. The very act of Trump, an important political figure, being accused and called to answer for his crimes is political. 

Therefore, if Trump somehow wins in 2024, as a felon or otherwise, it is unthinkable that he would be able to restrain himself from challenging the political systems that tried to hold him accountable in the first place. Even if he wanted to restrain himself. Again, it’s politics, if he is in power he will exercise it, his supporters would command him to do so regardless, right? Given the inherent political nature of the proceedings against him, it seems obvious to me that Trump would use government power to do something equally political. 

Since the nation is already in uncharted waters trying to prosecute a former, contentious president, if Trump wins in 2024, there is an incredibly likely chance that Trump would respond in kind and legally prosecute his enemies or otherwise exercise political power in ways unseen in American political history. 

This post is a prediction, one that I feel many Trump supporters are either ignoring or they want it to happen. Either way change my view and make it easier for me to live in TrumpTown and not be so cynical of US politics. Please poke holes in my appraisal of the situation. Please give me a reason to change my view and expect a boring election cycle in 2024.

187wktd,"CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans ""must"" run Biden or Trump ""because there are no other viable candidates"" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.","Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of ""status quo"" or ""inertia."" We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because ""we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate.""

I know couples in my personal life who got married quickly just to divorce less than two years being married.

Another thing to mention is I know after 8+ years and still no ring then that is considered a red flag, but as mentioned earlier i think each person should be aware of what they want to get out of the relationship within the first few months of dating.

17zz6u2,"CMV: Only Individuals, NOT limited liability entities, should be allowed to legally own real property zoned for single families.","There has been a housing crisis in the United States since the turn of the century. The damn broke in 2008 when large financial institutions violently awoke the nation from her American dream of homeownership. There has been a wealth “crisis” developing since the turn of the 19th century where individual wealth has depleted while corporately owned wealth has skyrocketed. Even the richest billionaire is but a worthless pauper compared to average multinational corporations. These two crises are related. The monumental wealth of large enterprises and the increasing poverty of the bourgeoisie has caused the prospect of owning a parcel of the planet earth ever more illusory each decade. 

We almost forget that *American* society exists to protect the citizen against the collective. This is *not* a socialist state, the rights of the individual are paramount against the rights of the group or the state. The citizen serves themselves, the citizen does not serve the state nor the corporation. To paraphrase, the Declaration of Independence holds that once a government no longer permits the citizen to live and die according to their means and abilities, the government must be dissolved by any means necessary. 

I am not saying that the US ought to collapse because of modern social inequalities like many radicals on the far left/right. Instead, I think a sensible solution to the dual problems of inequality and the lack of owned real properties is a simple change in national policy. It should be law across every jurisdiction that areas zoned for “single-family” homes can only be sold to individuals born of woman. No entities may own real property zoned like this, unless such an entity exposes their owners to unlimited liability. 

I mention all the stuff about American culture/law to undermine the argument that prohibiting corporations from purchasing would violate the “freedom” of a corporation to engage in the market. Individuals have freedoms under the Constitution, and individuals may associate freely. But such associations should not have the same claim to rights/freedoms that individuals have. This argument is unavailing because society serves the individual, not the collective. 

Another counterargument I can imagine is that the economy might suffer because (1) housing prices are inflated; (2) the only entities that can reliably pay inflated prices with ready cash (or favorable financing) are corporate entities; and (3) if the wealthiest entities in the market are banned from buying, housing prices would dramatically collapse. Last time housing prices collapsed, Obama had to give billions to banking executives lest their feelings got hurt. /s (kinda). To this argument, I say the ends would justify the means. Billions in home equity would evaporate so that future generations could have a justifiable hope in affordable home ownership. 

TL;DR: Perpetuating the American dream for current and future generations of homebuyers is more important than big business profit and the retirement plans of current homeowners. Therefore business should be unilaterally banned from owning single-family owned property, any business currently owning such property should divest ASAP.",Ok-Story-9319,1134,741,0.9200000166893004,0.3247954166579929,1700514881,/r/changemyview/comments/17zz6u2/cmv_only_individuals_not_limited_liability/,2023,11,changemyview,2023-11-20 21:14:41
17tpxj8,"CMV: Most people who say that the education system in America doesn't teach you any ""real life skills"" just aren't good students and don't put any effort into school","Just to preface I am talking about high school in America here.

First of all, if high schools actually taught classes like taxes and personal financial literacy nobody would pay attention anyways. Second of all most people don't understand that subjects like math and science are like weightlifting for your brain. When do you ever see a football player ever do a squat on the field? Never, but doing squats builds up a level of strength in the legs that is vital to being a good football player. Same thing with school. You'll so often hear that ""ill never use algebra in the real world"" when the whole point is that you learn how to problem solve and also understand concepts and put them to work. English is an important subject because having good grammar and being a good writer is important no matter what. Thirdly you'll hear people say ""oh school is designed to made us into complacent workers who follow orders"" and this just isn't true. It's really not a crazy thing to expect kids to listen to their teachers and follow simple instructions (Which you have to do in the real world no matter what your job is)

My main gripe with the education system is that public schools in America do not pay the good teachers enough so any good teacher has no incentive to stay at a public school when they can go to a private school. The material we teach is 100% the right stuff.",ElectroFalcon34,1203,623,0.8299999833106995,0.3203252178893469,1699812666,/r/changemyview/comments/17tpxj8/cmv_most_people_who_say_that_the_education_system/,2023,11,changemyview,2023-11-12 18:11:06
180kyd2,CMV: I don't think the Marvels failed because moviegoers are sexist and racist,"As somebody who enjoys writing, I can empathize with the director Nia DaCosta. I would be heartbroken if a story I'd poured blood, sweat, and tears into was shunned by so many people and, going by any metric, the Marvels has failed to attract audiences. 

Nia DaCosta herself did an interview in which she said ""There are pockets that are really virulent and violent and racist — and sexist and homophobic and all those awful things. And I choose the side of the light. That’s the part of fandom I’m most attracted to."" I don't think it's fair to interpret that as her saying superhero fans in general are these things or the movie failed because of these things as some people are. 

But there are others who are convinced bigotry is responsible for the failure of ""The Marvels"" or at least primarily responsible. Based on the data I've seen, I don't think this is the case. It's true that white people and men didn't turn out in large numbers which could suggest bigotry was a major factor. But nobody else did either. 

So why did the Marvels perform poorly? In my view...

The Marvels itself does not score particularly well with critics. This is probably the biggest factor. A movie can have legs if it gets good word of mouth from viewers and critics. Elemental is a great example. Bombed initially, but came roaring back. The A cinema score no doubt helped it. And elemental touched on racism and discrimination too. 

Due to the strikes there was limited press

There's a lot of superhero fatigue. I personally couldn't make it through more than 15 minutes of part 1 of avengers endgame.

17zm3f0,CMV: people that don't opt-in for organs donation should go bottom of the list when it comes to become recipients,"This post is on the back of yesterday's post about how the default for organs donation should be opt-in and people should explicitly state that they want ot opt-out.

I was quite shocked at how many replies were against it, some people talked about ""tricking"" people, I'm not sure why, informative campaign could be done, is not some complex concept that the average person in the street can't understand. Also I'm not going into the debate on why people would rather have their organs rot in the ground instead of helping a fellow human being, but here's a proposal that I think would reconcile these views:

We keep the system as it is, but if you don't opt-in as an organ donor you go to the bottom of the list if you ever need one. Here are some points that got me to this idea:

* We already give priorities to organ recipients: age, medical history, etc (basically chances of survival) are already taken into consideration when lists are compiled, it's not just first come first served.
* It totally respects individual freedom
* It incentivize much needed organs donation  
* it's fair to people that opted in 

Just to reiterate: I'm not saying that people that are not organ donors DON'T get an organ ever, only that they get a lower score compared to people that opted-in, that's only fair, if you think your organs are too precious to donate even when you're dead, surely you can't expect others to do any differently. Otherwise you're just an HYPOCRITE. It's all about FAIRNESS. 

Now, I'm bias to the argument, my other half has received a kidney and is one of those things that people that haven't been through can't understand what it means to see a loved one getting sick, going through dialysis, going through the long process of getting into a recipient list and finally the long wait. 

Final couple of points: 

I'm sure there're super rare occasions where my POV may create some contradictions, we can discuss them and (as a society) find a solution, I don't believe in discarding good ideas just because they are not so good in the 0.1% of cases.   
Different countries have different protocols for organ donation/transplant. So pointing why it wouldn't work due to a specific law/regulation is a bit of a weak argument. I believe in principle every modern democratic country could implement this idea.

17v10la,CMV: Trump’s odds of winning in 2024 are significantly overstated in betting markets (currently a 50/50 on predictit),"I feel that giving trump 50/50 odds of winning the 2024 presidential election is overly generous. 

Ever since Trump initially won in 2016, Republicans have failed to win at a national level. 2018 was considered a disappointment for them, trump lost in 2020, 2022 “red wave” never materialized, and now suddenly we’re supposed to believe that 2024 will turn things around. 

For Trump to win, he needs to pick up 3 of the 6 below states- 

- Georgia
- Wisconsin
- Arizona
- Pennsylvania
- Michigan
- Nevada

Georgia went blue because of the growth of Atlanta, which has only continued to grow. The population has gone up by 300,000 people since 2020. The whole j6 and Georgia lawsuits has only served to hurt Trump’s image in that state. I consider his odds of flipping that state very poor considering his position is weaker than the last time he lost.

I consider his odds to win in Pennsylvania incredibly poor, considering how his endorsement of Oz couldn’t beat a disabled candidate in the senate. PA is getting bluer. 

Michigan is a lost cause for the GOP considering how Tudor Dixon performed there. 

I almost didn’t include Nevada in this list because it has always felt like a stretch for the trump campaign. It’s a state that has very slowly started to shift red, but Trump needs to find 30,000 votes to flip there in 24 to win it and I don’t see where they will come from. 

Arizona is like 60/40 for Biden because of the continued growth of Phoenix and the unpopularity of trump there due to his arduous history with John McCain. 

And finally there’s Wisconsin, which was incredibly close and I guess he could win in 24. They had a winning gop race I recently. To be nice to him, let’s say that one is 60/40 for trump.

So that’s 1 state that he is 60/40 likely win (Wisconsin), 1 where he’s a 60/40 on the losing end (Arizona), and 4 where I consider his chance of victory to be very poor. I’ll assign them 25% chances of winning each. 

Plugging those odds into a calculator online, I see that his odds of winning would really be 11.27%, rather than 50/50. 

I believe that my estimates make sense given the current environment and issues like abortion making republicans have a very difficult uphill battle with voters. I’d be curious as to things I’m missing with my estimates that would require I shift my view.

2) constantly increasing minimum wage throughout their working life, while engaging in free trade deals to make it easy to outsource work for cheap products. then, engaging in mass immigration because foreign workers will accept jobs for passports that kids just wont do that cheap.

3) underfunding education once they or their own kids had graduated. They increased class size, started giving university spots to foreign students, and allowing raising tuition to make it less accessible/more daunting. they also removed or reduced public childcare programs in many places.

4) sending cities and other governments into debt with spending that increases the value of their land,    and not raising property taxes like other taxes.

5) the bailout. measures to keep their investments and economic predictions and pension on track, at the expense of everyone else.

My place of work has recently been running workshops on ""anti-racism"". I myself have been trying to engage with it as much as I can to try and better myself. 

One aspect that I find difficult is the idea that racism has to have a power inbalance. In my own country (the UK) a white person cannot experience racism as they hold more structural power. They can be *discriminated* against but that is not racism. 

I find this idea difficult for two main reasons:

1. I always thought and was taught growing up that racism is where you disciminate based off of the colour of someones skin. In that definition, a white person can experience racism. The white person may not be harmed as much by it, but it is still discriminating agaist someone based on their race. 
2. In my place of work (a school), we have to often deal with racist incidents. One of the most common so far this year is racist remarks from black students towards asian ones. Is this racism? I can't confidently decide who has the greater power imbalance! 

I promise that this is coming from a place of good faith!

17ugk46,CMV: The majority of people who think the economy is doing poorly dont understand inflation and the process of getting it under control and instead think they would be better off in a recession,"A large percentage of people currently believe that Biden is doing terrible on the economy, largely due to inflation and difficulty affording things. I think that is entirely because they do not have an understanding of what inflation actually is and dont realize that this is, in fact, the ideal scenario. 

When Biden was inaugurated, inflation was at 7.7% and is currently down to 3.7%. While still elevated, this is a remarkable improvement and the fact that we are slowly approaching the ideal rate of 2% without entering a recession and having people continued to be employed is remarkable. I think, what people dont understand, is that inflation is cumulative and the numbers will never go back down without major things happening and I would like to use the example of food to illustrate this. There are two things that will cause the price of food to largely return to where it was, either a technological breakthrough that doubles yields (not happening) or, the more likely scenario, a drastic decrease in demand because people are out of work and are no longer able to afford anything because the economy is in a recession. I think this later scenario is what many are naively arguing for! 

In addition, I dont think they really understood the 3 paths that we were facing at that time. The first path was runaway inflation, second path was slowly decreasing the inflation rate to 2%, and the third path was entering into a recession. I think we are currently on this middle path and seem to be doing it really well, but if you look at posts all over reddit, people will say, ""the economy isnt doing great, I can barely afford my rent and groceries when I used to be able to"". I am not saying that isnt true, but they dont realize that that is the goal. Would they rather we have entered into runaway inflation?

It sounds elitist sure, but I strongly believe that it’s true. Popular sovereignty is a nice idea, but an extremely bad one. Literacy tests were certainly abused during the Jim Crow era, but they have well-founded reasoning behind them. 

Demagoguery can really only occur if the population is ignorant enough to believe that the would-be tyrant isn’t lying; or that history repeats itself. 

Take Trump for example. Those who haven’t read primary sources reflecting the rise of the German National Socialist Party might not see the parallels between American populism and German populism. Or at worst, people might not even know what populism is. 

From a policy perspective, the ignorant might think a bunch of government stimulus is a good thing and will never have any negative consequences. Whereas anyone who took high school economics could tell you that inflation will rise as a direct consequence of free money injected into consumer wallets.

182fd42,CMV: Nobody has the inherent right to any territory,"Nobody has the inherent right to any piece of land

I often hear the idea that certain groups of people have the inherent right to any group of land because ""they were there first"", and I hear this regarding many groups like native Americans, the Jewish state, or others.

But the reality is that nobody has any inherent right to a piece of land. Maps are drawn through war, and territory belongs to whichever group can conquer it. Some people may be forgetting that because the borders of western nations haven't been redrawn for a while.

Just as the Comanche conquered land in America's southern territory and took it from the Apache, the American government conducted a series of wars against the native Americans and took land from them.

Japan used to be numerous states but a man by the name of Oda Nobunaga led a series of conquests in order to unite Japan into a single nation. He died, but his goal was fulfilled by some other individuals.

We see the same thing happening right now in Ukraine. If Russia can take it then it's their territory. But Ukraine seems to be quite capable in defending themselves, so they get to keep ownership of the territory. And the same thing is happening in Gaza right now. If Hamas can defend the territory then they can keep it, but otherwise they might lose it.

This might sound insensitive but this is just the way the world works and is how it has always worked. Your right to a piece of property is upheld by the laws of your country. The laws are upheld by the government, and the Sovereignty of the government is upheld by the military establishment. Even countries without militaries are defended by (other) militaries.

17wqbsc,CMV: an engagement ring should be given back if the engagement is called off.,"I was watching a Netflix show where a woman decides she’s no longer attracted to her fiancé so she breaks things off. When he asks for the ring back she refuses, he hesitates then agrees that she can keep it and angrily claims that every time she sees it she’ll think of their short lived relationship. 

This got me thinking of my ex fiancé, and how I broke things off, I did pretty much the same thing and she claimed it was so pretty so I gave in and let her keep it, eventually I got it back but there was no reason for her to keep it in the first place as an engagement ring represents a promise, it’s usually expensive, and it basically turns into a trophy celebrating how I got this person to propose to me, it seems almost greedy or narcissistic to keep.

Outside of the fiancé dying or not asking for it back there’s no benevolent reason to keep an engagement ring, if someone asks for it back it should be given back, please, change my view.",KeyStoneLighter,1059,216,0.9100000262260436,0.2325873343711829,1700150342,/r/changemyview/comments/17wqbsc/cmv_an_engagement_ring_should_be_given_back_if/,2023,11,changemyview,2023-11-16 15:59:02
17m51d2,CMV: Parents should be required to be present in the room and watch the whole procedure while their child is being circumcised.,"At least in North America,  parents usually stay out of the procedure room while their child is being circumcised. I believe if parents would have to stomach watching their child getting mutilated fewer people would want to do it and it would fall out of favor.

Aside from clinically indicated cases, circumcision is a barbaric and unnecessary practice based on distorted perceptions stemmed from religion or social norms.

The prepuce (foreskin) is a normal part of the body that protects the very sensitive glans of the penis. Unless there is a clinical indication for amputating a normal part of the body, it is mutilation. 

Circumcision is also a violation of four basic human rights:
- the convention against torture 
- the convention of the rights of the child
- the universal declaration of human rights
- and the international covenant on civil and political rights.",zerokids2023,525,885,0.6899999976158142,0.2308949118174765,1698936133,/r/changemyview/comments/17m51d2/cmv_parents_should_be_required_to_be_present_in/,2023,11,changemyview,2023-11-02 14:42:13
17xur4t,CMV: Vegan “leather” is dumb,"Alright first off I would like to make it clear that this is not an attack on veganism; its a noble cause to minimize the suffering of animals but vegan leather in particular is a terrible alternative. Although I am not vegan because meat tastes too good.

Firstly its simply lower quality that real leather.
Leather fibrous structure is much more durable than faux, leading it to last longer. Even if its for something that doesn't need to be resilient, leather patinas beautifully as it ages, while faux just breaks down and cracks. Because of this vegan leather is replaced more often than produced more waste.

Not only does faux create more waste but it also is much worse for the environment. Leather is biodegradable because it obviously comes from animals. 90% of vegan leather is made of plastic which cant say the same. There are some alternative vegan leathers made of cactus and other stuff but they are uncommon and still mixed with synthetic materials which also do not biodegrade.

So vegan leather produces more waste, and is more environmentally taxing but at least its free from animal suffering right? Well yes, but you can make an argument that leather is too. Almost all leather is a biproduct of the meat industry, meaning cows aren't being killed for their hides. If we all stopped buying leather it wouldn't have a major effect on the quantity of cows being slaughtered, we'd just use less of the cows. I view it like the Native Americans and the buffalo. To show respect for the buffalo they used everything. Nothing went to waste. Their hide is better as a pair of boots than rotting in a landfill.

Anyway if anyone feels I am misunderstanding why people prefer vegan leather, change my view. Thanks",SennheiserHD6XX,804,516,0.7599999904632568,0.2288866896628939,1700270417,/r/changemyview/comments/17xur4t/cmv_vegan_leather_is_dumb/,2023,11,changemyview,2023-11-18 01:20:17
185skh3,CMV: I think it's insecure for people to try to control whether or not their partner watches p*rn,"I'm genuinely opened to have my opinion changed on this.

I think the porn industry is exploitative as hell. I think using porn on a daily basis is bad for your mental health and how you view relationships with people.

I definitely see the ethical concerns with porn consumption itself.

What bothers me is the insecurity people have with it.

I view myself as an inherently non-jealous person. It takes an awful lot for someone to make me jealous with my partner.

I think, I could see myself getting jealous if my boyfriend was getting nudes from another girl directly or sex tapes.

I can't understand why being interested in seeing another person naked would be an issue for someone. Isn't that just biology? Especially for men who are much more visual.

I think that having to shut that off to cater to a partner's insecurities is unreasonable. It's like asking someone to become asexual for anyone but you.

I genuinely don't understand. I've seen so many people talk about their partner's pornography use or even finding other people attractive on social media and becoming jealous over it.

Why is it ok to cater to that insecurity? Isn't that unhealthy in a relationship?

I also think men have different biological urges than women. Like, alot of men will get physically uncomfortable if they go too long without ejaculating. If they don't do it while awake, they'll do it in your sleep. I view it as a regulation like peeing or pooping, and porn just making it simpler.

I think it becomes an issue when it interferes with your sex life or you expect your partner to fill the void pornography does for you.

Can anyone enlighten me on why I could be wrong in my perception of this?",Successful_Radish484,372,886,0.6700000166893005,0.2020771995838849,1701165601,/r/changemyview/comments/185skh3/cmv_i_think_its_insecure_for_people_to_try_to/,2023,11,changemyview,2023-11-28 10:00:01
17qex82,"CMV: The narrative that ""a voice actor should only voice characters of the race they belong to"" is not only nonsense, but has the potential to horribly backfire on the people promoting it if applied to them without excuses and compromises.","Let's deconstruct this narrative. It's very straightforward. A voice actor of race X, should only voice a character also of race X. If character is of race Y, then only a voice actor of race Y should play that character.  
I disagree with this. To me, voice acting comes down to the quality of your voice, your ability to take on the role and voice it. To me the narrative being put forward is nonsense, because what it is pushing goes against what I see voice acting as. It promotes the disqualification of a so many talents, based on solely on their race. We demote ourselves from choosing quality to now choosing skin color.  
Now to be clear, I am not saying people of a race are not good at voicing certain races or their own race. Rather, I am arguing that we are making quality less of a priority. And to illustrate this, let me entertain two scenarios:  
1. A white voice actor is chosen to voice a person of color because they are better at voicing the \*\*character\*\*, than the voice actor who is of the same race of the character, \*\*but\*\* is not as suited to the character as the people making the content desire.  
2. A \*\*non-white\*\* and \*\*non-Japanese\*\* voice actor, is chosen to voice a \*\*Japanese\*\* character in an anime, even though the character is not their race, because their voice acting ability is better suited to that character than the available Japanese voice actors who are the character's race, but not as suited for that character.  
I support both of these scenarios for being reality, because in both cases the \*quality\* of the persons ability to voice the character is what took priority. If the voice actor is chosen for a character who is also of their race, it should be because they had the talent to voice a character, who is not just defined by their skin but their way talking, the \*personality\* of their voice, which the actor was able to bring out better than other actors. Not because they were the same race as that character.  
Now I also made the claim in my view that the narrative has the potential to \*backfire\* on the people promoting it. And to explain it quite simply I need only point out that the people promoting these views... A themselves voicing characters not of their race. I don't even mean voicing non-human-like characters. I mean human beings or human equivalent characters who are of a certain race/ethnicity, being represented by voice actors who are not that race/ethnicity.  
For example:  
Mr SungWon Cho. Ethnicity: Korean.  A prominent promoter of this narrative.  
His roles include:  
Vice Admiral Legrange - Anglo-French ([86](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24481))  
Kajinosuke Tanikaze - Japanese ([Records of Ragnarok](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24643))  
Koutaro Tatsumi - Japanese ([The Honor Student at Magic High School](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=23898))  
This nice video reel of his roles [on his Twitter (X) account](https://twitter.com/i/status/1717961644331208749). Plenty of non-Asian, let alone non-Korean roles there  
Ms Shakyra Dunn. Ethnicity: Black as per her twitter. An example I wish to put forward of who this would backfire on.  
Her roles are all compiled her by herself which saved me a lot of trouble:  
[On her instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx5yR18uKwW/)  
Now if we were to apply this narrative upon them, then they would have to relinquish a great number of roles, not because they can't voice them well, but because they are not the same race/ethnicity. And I am willing to bet that a good number of the voice actors who promote this narrative would also lose a large portion of their roles, because they do not fit the race of the character. In other words, it would backfire on them.  
The only way to avoid this backfiring would be to make exceptions and compromises. To say ""Oh well but this is different...."". No if we are going to go with this, then we need to go all the way. If this narrative is going to dominate voice acting then everyone should face the consequences that come with it, regardless of their race. And that would be the biggest backfire for the entire voice acting community for what I believe is absolute nonsense.  
It would reduce voice acting to be a race based profession first and talent based profession second. The mighty Kratos from God of War (Norse) is voiced by Christopher Judge, a man who has my favorite voice for Kratos in the series. But Kratos is Greek. And since voice acting is supposed to be done by the matching race.. Oh well I guess Christopher loses his job huh?  
I hope I have properly illustrated my view. And hope to see if anyone can find a way to change my view. You may change it by convincing me that voice acting should be about race first and talent second and that this would not backfire on the people promoting it.",Delusional_Gamer,805,324,0.8799999952316284,0.200547037149353,1699421910,/r/changemyview/comments/17qex82/cmv_the_narrative_that_a_voice_actor_should_only/,2023,11,changemyview,2023-11-08 05:38:30
17zdr3r,CMV: There is no reasonable justification for the incredibly high civilian death toll in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war,"I’ve been watching the conflict unfold, as many of us have, with horror at what seems to be a conflict that either primarily hurts, or primarily targets, Gazan civilians. Civilian deaths primarily seem to come from the direct targeting of civilian infrastructure, including refugee camps, apartment buildings, hospitals, schools, mosques, and even evacuation convoys. 

Each time a civilian target is hit, the general IDF justification seems to be that Hamas was using civilians as human shields. However, frequently the IDF will either claim they were targeting only a single Hamas fighter in an attack that was obviously bound to kill scores of civilians (the first attack on the Jabalia Refugee Camp, for instance), and/or there are no Hamas casualties substantiated after the attack, either by the IDF or by human rights orgs (Amnesty International lists a number of prominent attacks that seemed to have no discernable political targets: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/damning-evidence-of-war-crimes-as-israeli-attacks-wipe-out-entire-families-in-gaza/#:~:text=As%20Israeli%20forces%20continue%20to,be%20investigated%20as%20war%20crimes).

Seeing this, I’ve generally come to the conclusion that:

1. Israel is either willing to accept extreme, easily avoidable or unnecessary civilian casualties to kill individual Hamas fighters or 
2. Targeting civilians is actually an intentional part of Israeli military strategy in this conflict 

I will also note that these casualties dont exactly seem to be producing successful mission outcomes: the command center in Al Shifa seems to be nonexistent, and  the number of Hamas fighters killed seems to be quite low for the carnage so far (I think the IDF claimed around 1000 last time I checked?). The hostages are also, mostly, still without a safe guarantee of coming home.

In the end, none of this seems justifiable to me. 

However, I realize that there are many people out there who feel strongly that the war is necessary, justified, and even good. I want to challenge myself and try to see things from a side that, right now, seems very difficult for me to understand.

183xayy,"cmv: When people say 'white', they mean 'white North American'.","Disclaimer: This doesn't really affect North American people. This post is centered around a Eurpean perspective, and so it might be confusing to some of you. 


I live in Germany as an immigrant, and I have friends from all across the world. I am European. 

Across the bank, the majority of friends I have met that were from outside of Europe had a very specific set of prejudices against me, that never really bothered me too much and just calmly explained this was not a thing in my country. 

I have noticed, however, that some things always repeated although being absolutely absurd. Here are some examples of the things I have been told/ were expected of me. 

1) Not seasoning food

- I am Italian. We have very simple cuisine but it's good. The same friends who tell me this about ""white people"" love my cooking and ask for my recipes/ to make their favourite dish again. 

2) Not having an own culture

- A friend of mine said something along the lines of ""White people appropriate other cultures and festivities because they don't really have their own"". I believe we were talking about Dia de los Muertos in that regard. But all European countries have their own very different cultures. 

In general, I don't think ""black culture"" and ""white culture"" apply to Europe the same way they do to the US. While there may be an african american culture across the U.S., my Ethiopian friend and my Tanzanian friend have just as little in common as a Russian and a Spanish person. They don't share one culture, they each have their own, which may overlap in some parts of life. 

3) My culture was never oppressed

I come from a part of Italy that used to have it's own language and traditions. When Italy was formed in the 19th century, people were forced to stop having their own customs and speaking their own language, or call themselves anything other than Italians. 

My grandparents still spoke the language, but I was never allowed to. I was expected to behave like an Italian so that I would have better chances in life and people would not know my background, which was considered lesser. 

I am not an exception. There are many ethnic groups in Europe that are considered white and still suffered oppression and sometimes persecution. I hate to see these stories devalued by someone saying a blanket statement.

4) This is silly, but the sandal

""White people will never understand how scary it is when your mother picks up the sandal"". But we do have the sandal in Italy. And when I pointed this out, I was told that that was cultural appropriation. 

5) Beige

""White people love to have their walls painted beige and all interior decor has to be beige.""

This was just yesterday. I talked about how houses in my region are not like that at all. And then I thought about it and described how Swedish houses are not like that. Nor are russian houses. Or French ones. Or Spanish ones. Or German ones, at that. Even my German friend, who initially agreed (in shame) that all white houses were just beige, did so while sitting in her perfectly colourful apartment with no beige in sight. I asked her if she had ever seen such a beige home in real life. She has not. Neither had anyone else, when we thought about it. 

To be honest, I don't even think most American white people live like that. I think it's just a social media fad. 



And that brings me to the reason why I am here:

As much as I am not upset at people when they make assumptions, it can be tiring when you hear the same things over and over again. I am upset that European people have to be culturally associated with North America just because we look similar, even though culturally we are so far apart. Social media paints a picture where every white person is from a Florida suburb, and people choose to believe it. 

Please tell me I am wrong about this, a I would hate to be right.",7kingsofrome,593,451,0.75,0.1792814532295333,1700956793,/r/changemyview/comments/183xayy/cmv_when_people_say_white_they_mean_white_north/,2023,11,changemyview,2023-11-25 23:59:53

I’m 31m, been single a few years til about 6 months ago, met 32f who is perfect on every metric.

Except. Shes very eager to have kids. Is the only child of her parents so is the only chance of them having grandkids, and her friends all have kids she’s a godmother 3 times already.

My view of kids has always been “if I have to”, and when I met my partner I said “I’ll imagine I’ll have them some day”. And I told her this as well, quoting every single person I know with children saying “it’s the best decision of your life, you’ll never know stronger love etc etc.”

So we’ve started visiting her friends with kids, and my nieces and nephews, and tbh Reddit I’m looking at my watch every minute. I’m seeing the destroyed houses and the dirty faces and the screaming and climbing and smells and tantrums and CONSTANT CHATTER and if anything I’m less enthused.
My reasoning:
1) the world is over populated, there doesn’t need to be more children.
2) I shouldn’t have kids just to have someone to look after me in my old age.
3) I’m loving the fact I can do whatever I want whenever I want within my work schedule/budget, I don’t want to give this up.
4) Financially it’s over 100k to raise a kid, money I could put towards my retirement/home.
5) I’m not even a pet person let alone a kid person.
6) My parents already have grandkids, I’m not obligated to provide more.
7) I just do not have the patience

Caveat though, if I were to have a kid, there’s no one I’d want to have a kid with more than my current partner. She’s wonderful, she’d make a great mum and I’d never be sick of her. Part of me will concede to the kid just so we don’t break up.

Soo it falls to you Reddit. Would love a response that counterpoints my view above.

Please don’t give me platitudes: “ it’ll be different when it’s your own” and for the love of the divine I don’t need “hey man if you don’t wanna have kids you don’t have to, tell your partner it’s unfair” I KNOW.
I’m looking to have my view changed. I WANT to want to have kids I just don’t.

17mtqet,CMV: the United States government should pay teachers similar to military service members relative to experience and education,"I served in the US Army and my final rank was Sergeant (E5). I am currently a math teacher with a MS in Math plus an additional 30 graduate credit hours and 14 years of teaching experience. 

My current salary is $68,000 and I live in a rural area in Northern Georgia. While cost of living is low here, I can't help but look up what my pay would had been had I stayed in the military - even if I stay as E5, with my wife and kid, my base pay plus BAH would put me at around the same as my current salary, without the degrees and I am not even counting my qualifiers that would net higher pay. 

Both teachers and military are performing vital public services, so why is pay gap this enormous? Objectively, my job in the Army was far easier - I only need to focus on my mission and manage fewer than 5 personnel who have to complete basic training/AIT, so in a sense, self-selected. Whereas as a teacher, I am responsible for the learning outcome of 30+ young people who often do not want to be here.

I have to complete 6 years of higher education in STEM program to even get started in my teaching career for my current pay track (I would get paid even less if I only have a BS) plus it took me years in teaching before I firmly grasp the craft of education; whereas I enlisted in the Army when I was 17 with just a HS diploma, promoted to E5 after 2 years in services (I joined as E3 due to JROTC, received a waiver for E4 at 18 months TIS, then promoted to E5 in secondary zone), I know that is a bit faster than most, but I didn't really need to have much qualifications for my enlistment and promotions. 

As an E5, I was highly expendable. I get it that recruitment number are low but someone else could have easily done replaced me. Yet, as a math teacher, it is next to impossible for me to be replaced. Our department have been operating with 
 less than 75% faculty due to multiple people leaving within the past few years and we simply failed to attract new hires. As of the past 4 years, I am the only person in my department who is qualified to teach Statistics, all of us are teaching more students, committing more tutoring hours... The point is, the military recruitment shortage isn't due to low pay, but teacher shortage is.

My view is that Americans should commit to paying teachers just as much as paying military service members, after all, one cannot function without another.",JianJiaHei,479,576,0.8299999833106995,0.1762722706795852,1699013799,/r/changemyview/comments/17mtqet/cmv_the_united_states_government_should_pay/,2023,11,changemyview,2023-11-03 12:16:39

17wrmkj,"CMV: If they are all equally humanely (or inhumanely) killed, there is nothing that makes the consumption of cat meat, dog meat, horse meat, dolphin meat, etc. any more or less moral than the consumption of pork, poultry, beef, fish or mutton.","As someone once said, ""People get outraged about dolphins being caught in tuna nets, but why aren't they outraged about the tuna being caught in tuna nets?""

There is no valid argument given as for why certain animals should be ethical to consume as meat and others should not be (other than, perhaps, that certain animals are killed in more inhumane ways than others, but the objection has often persisted even *if* they were all to be killed the same way.)

**Cuteness:**  The argument is oft-given that dogs and cats are cuter than pigs and chickens, and hence should not be consumed. But this is highly subjective. What if I find chickens to be cute, but don't think cats or horses are cute?

**Intelligence:** The argument is oft-given that dogs, dolphins, monkeys are more intelligent, and hence should not be consumed. But the octopus is a highly intelligent animal, yet people don't object to it being eaten.

**""It's gross"":**  This is also highly subjective. One may think it's gross to eat horse meat, but then again many cultures consume pork while Muslims think pork is despicable. So if I think it is gross but you think it's okay, why should my preferences overrule yours?

A waiter comes over to you're table, asks what you want, comes over maybe twice to check how everything is going and then hands you the bill (sometimes more depending on what you order but if everyone at your table gets a main and drink it already ends up being so expensive I couldn't imagine ordering more). In what world is this simple service worth a MINIMUM of 18% which always ends up being over $20? 

I have absolutely nothing against waiters and appreciate what they do but what they expect from us is just completely unrealistic. Most waiters I've seen are serving ~5 tables at a time, if each of these tables have 4 people at them there totals are always going to get to the $100 mark, $20 tip per table so let's just go on the high side and assume these people are there for 2 hours, that's $50 per hour in tips alone!

* ""Walmart is unsafe because there was a credit card skimmer on a cash register. Therefore I can take items I want for free every week.""

17vzoxn,CMV: People who plan not to vote for Biden because of his handling of the Israel-Palestine conflict are damaging their own cause,"I understand that there are a lot of emotions about the current conflict, but the other day there was a pro-Palestine rally in my very liberal neighborhood and people were chanting “Fuck Joe Biden!” 

I was shocked and have since read that, among those who support Palestine, some are saying that Biden’s trip to Israel, his plan to send economic support for their army, and his speeches supporting them have cost him their vote in the 2024 presidential election.

Meanwhile, Trump is the one who recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, called for a ban of all Muslims immigrating to the United States and has recently suggested that we should ban anyone from Gaza from entering the United States. I read a quote from him stating that, if he were elected in 2024, “Israel would never have to be prepared” against future attacks, implying he would completely destroy Gaza to remove that threat. In short, Trump’s position is much more strongly pro-Israel and virulently anti-Palestine than Biden.

Additionally, although Biden has supported Israel, he has also reportedly urged caution about the scale of the invasion, voiced disagreement with Israel’s handling of the war, and insisted on humanitarian pauses and delivery of aid to the Gazan people. In short he seems to be a voice of reason and advocating for civilian safety.

Granted that some progressives in deep blue states abstaining from voting for Biden may not swing the election to Trump.

186krbt,CMV: hell is a horrible concept morally,"This post goes for anybody who belongs to the abrahamic religions or any other religion that believes in hell 

Many people have made the argument I’m gonna make here against religion but I’m asking it because I’ve never heard a good refutation and it is one of the biggest points of argument for me that these religions are fictional

So hell is universally considered to be a place of eternal torture, involving burning for the unfortunate beings who end up there. This goes on for eternity. Can you imagine what somebody would have to do to you for you to want them to burn *for the rest of eternity*? Our minds can’t even comprehend a timeframe that long. It will never end. Imagine if we kept prisoners alive permanently somehow and kept them in a cell for the rest of the universes existence. And that’s only a cell, that’s not burning them the entire time it’s happening

And worse yet, this doesn’t just go for somebody who mercilessly rapes then murders an innocent child, this goes for me, and most of the people who have ever existed and exist today because we either reject God or worship the wrong one. Why should a Hindu who is born in India and spends their entire lives only knowing Hinduism be tortured for the rest of eternity? Why should an atheist scientist be tortured for the rest of eternity for simply learning about science and realizing that fundamentalist abrahamic religions don’t work well with it? 

This honestly seems like one of the most evil beliefs one can have to me, given that the religious person believes it literally and not metaphorically. I can see believing that people will go to a metaphorical hell for not adopting certain beliefs, though even that I disagree with cause it doesn’t apply to everyone

I’ll give Muslims a bit of leeway for this cause at least, according to what I’ve been told as I was converting to Islam, a persons exposure to the religion is taken into account and for some I guess there is another challenge after they die if they don’t make it to jannah. But even then, many ex Muslims go on to be perfectly decent people so this is still morally reprehensible

For Christians from what I know this is a hard set rule that if you reject Christ, you burn for eternity

18rjb74,Cmv: One of the worst things that could happen to a person is being born in a third world country.,"So I’m from Nigeria and I moved to the USA years ago with my father and based on my experiences I believe living in a third world country is one of the worst things to happen to a person. I’ve seen how much my parents have sacrificed just to be in this country. I know how much money my father has paid to get us papers in the United States. I honestly couldn’t even believe he had spent that much money. My dad studied industrial engineering in Nigeria and it didn’t even help him in the United States because most employers see that degree as worthless because he got it in a Nigerian university. He never studied here and so now he has to settle for low wage jobs. My dad works so hard, six days a week and we basically live paycheck to paycheck. It’s tough ngl. I just feel like our lives as a whole would be so much better and stress free if not for the fact that we were born in Nigeria, can see our country falling apart and so now we were forced to make this hard journey here. I was also in Nigeria this summer and the country is rife with so much poverty. This are getting worse every day and the basic amenities I enjoy in the United States are like luxuries over there. While I was in Nigeria, there was a time my electricity went out and we had no electricity for almost an entire day. As a result our water went out and we had to fill up buckets of water at someone else’s house just to be able to wash dishes and flush the toilet. I once spoke to my dad and I asked him “so how does a person in Nigeria live a decent life and fulfill something for themselves” and he told me he doesn’t know. Degrees in Nigeria are almost useless now as there are no jobs whatsoever. 
So in conclusion I feel like being from a third world country is on of the worst things to happen to a person because the struggles of living in one in the first place is stressful,draining and horrible, while the struggles of leaving one is also horrible as you have to endure and sacrifice a lot so either way you will suffer, unless you’re rich I guess.",Various_Beach_7840,1951,743,0.8999999761581421,0.6259749067480502,1703627587,/r/changemyview/comments/18rjb74/cmv_one_of_the_worst_things_that_could_happen_to/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-26 21:53:07
18cacyg,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,"I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating.",wettigingss,403,2949,0.5600000023841858,0.6032803690415172,1701886825,/r/changemyview/comments/18cacyg/cmv_dating_is_objectively_harder_for_men_than_it/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-06 18:20:25
18m9szu,"CMV: If trump wins it won't be the fault of the left or of young people for not voting, it will be the fault of moderate liberals and centrists for choosing bad candidates in the primaries.","1.  The left and the youth always get blamed whenever republicans win but most if not all of the time it's because moderates force through corporate democrats under the guise of ""electability"" even when that claim is verifiably false (ie: bernie being a stronger head to head matchup against trump than biden was in the polls) even against the complaints of the same people they always accuse of not turning out to vote.
If they want those groups to vote they need to be willing to make a sacrifice and support legitimately good candidates in the primaries even if it makes them uncomfortable, ""vote blue no matter who"" can't just be a slogan to browbeat the left with, it cuts both ways, they need to suck it up and vote blue no matter who even if that blue is a leftist candidate. The best way to get the leftists in your party to show up for the election is to be willing to compromise and support a candidate they can actually get excited about.

2. There is a disparity of motive between the moderates and the left. The left has legitimate moral reason to hate the candidates moderates push through the primaries due to the massive harm and loss of life their foreign policy inflicts upon helpless people abroad as well as the concessions they make to corporations, this is especially prevalent this election cycle with biden overtly funding and vocally supporting the genocide of the Palestinian people in gaza as well as admitting that he himself is a zionist, zionism being an inherently imperialist/fascistic ideology which supports the creation and expansion of an ethnostate.
The moderates however, have no such moral complaints against left leaning candidates and instead base most of their complaints in emotion and fear; making vague statements about them being ""too far left"" or ""not electable enough"" and repeating talking points from McCarthyism/the red scare which have no backing or basis in reality especially seeing as leftist candidates tend to support policies that have much broader appeal than the moderates do on a policy by policy basis and often fare better in direct match-ups against the opposition. This has been proven in real world scenarios as well with left leaning candidates winning in deep red states against republican candidates where the democratic party routinely takes losses when putting forth centrist/corporatist candidates. Essentially the left has a legitimate moral justification whereas moderates are acting out of fear and discomfort and tend to push through candidates that make them feel comfortable even if those candidates are monstrous human beings who shouldn't be allowed anywhere near power.

3. Moderates in the democratic voter base have forced this choice on the left for decades and it always results in a back and forth fight with the party in power switching every few years as things slowly get worse. Whereas in those locations where further left leaning candidates win, those areas tend to stay blue much longer as a result of the people living there seeing the positive effect of the policies left leaning candidates put into place.


4. All this to say that If moderates want to actually win elections, they need to stop supporting candidates that are widely unliked by both sides of the political spectrum and stop blaming ""the left"" when it is observably their fault that this is happening. ""The left"" can't be logically blamed when their candidates are consistently more successful when given the chance in real elections. It's moderates that are costing us elections and it's moderates that will be at fault for the US slipping into a full blown fascist dictatorship if they hand the presidency to trump by putting forth a nominee nobody likes.


Things that won't change my mind:

1. ***""It's actually conservatives fault""*** Yeah, sure I agree, they're bad people and ultimately to blame, but it's a waste of time and effort to try and change their minds. We should focus on groups that actually can change. Those are leftists and moderates and of the two moderates don't have a real justification for continuing to impose their bs on others.

2. ***""but biden did (insert good thing here)""*** Biden/any centrist doing good things on occasion, or even often does not outweigh the lives they take with their foreign policy and it certainly doesn't outweigh outright genocide.

3. Appealing to me personally to vote for him. This isn't about my vote; it's about how if he loses I won't blame leftists/the youth, I'll blame moderates who constantly saddle us with unappealing nominees that are so bad it's more surprising when they win than when they lose.

4. ***""biden doesn't actually have control over what happens in gaza/biden is already trying to stop it""*** This one I've heard a lot recently and the first part is dubious at best, israel could not do what it does without the funding the US gives it and biden has control over that the second part is easily disproven with his own words and actions.",Aberration-13,854,2186,0.6499999761581421,0.5894962352474555,1703013121,/r/changemyview/comments/18m9szu/cmv_if_trump_wins_it_wont_be_the_fault_of_the/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-19 19:12:01
18fx9zx,"CMV: If switching the gender/race/any demographic group in a statement makes that statement sound bigoted, then it was bigoted in the first place. Always.","EDIT: I was wrong to use the word ""sound"" in the title. I meant to make it more understandable, but it detracts from my point. Let me rephrase: If switching the demographic group makes it bigoted, then it was bigoted before the switching too. I used ""sound"" because a lot of people can instinctively recognize some forms of bigotry as bigotry but are blind to the exact same reasoning with just a different demographic group swapped in. I used ""sound"" because, these people blind to bigotry again some groups, they will think ""hey, if you switch the demographic groups, it SOUNDS like bigotry"". As a matter of fact, it IS factually bigoted in both scenarios, both before and after the switching - the ""sound"" was purely relating to the ability of people to recognize bigotry as what it is.


For context, I am a gay, black, Senegalese man. I was born and raised in Senegal, then went to university in France and now I live and work in the USA. The observations that follow have all been made in the USA or online in US-centric spaces.

I have personally witnessed a staggering number of times when someone makes a statement that, if made about women/queer folk/PoC, would be decried as abhorrent and bigoted, but since it's made towards men/straight folks/white people is considered ok, even funny and ""progressive"". There is a whole genre of ""humor"" (and multiple big subreddits dedicated to it) about mocking heterosexual people; I have seen PoCs straight up saying that the opinion of a white person is invalid purely because they are white, etc. Generally, those attitudes seem to come from an utter lack of empathy towards those demographics and every time I see it, I cannot stop thinking that the ""progressive"" people acting in this hateful and discriminatory way would themselves happily be MAGA if they weren't themselves PoCs, queer or women. It is the exact same mindset, casual cruelty and refusal to see ""the other"" as a human being that I see in the worst ""traditional bigots"", just with the demographics switched around.

To get ahead of people pointing out systemic disadvantages: Yes, I know that, in the US of A, white people have more institutional power, men are generally better paid and better considered in the workplace, and het people's human rights are largely secure compared to queer people's rights. All of that is correct. However:

- It does not excuse interpersonal hatred or discrimination. Plainly, if you are hateful towards someone you do not know purely because of their birth-assigned characteristics, you are a profoundly terrible human being, NO MATTER what systemic forces are in place. To use a fictional example that won't lead to people jumping at my throat while refusing all rational discussion: Take Scar from the anime Fullmetal Alchemist. He is a survivor from Ishval, member of a racial minority that was slaughtered by the richer Amestrians. Scar's reaction is to go on a murderous rampage during which he kills, among many others, two innocent Amestrian doctors who were healing Ishvalans on the battlefield, then he tries to murder their even-more-innocent underage daughter. Just because they have blonde hair, which is a sign of Amestrians. Scar associates the entire demographic group with evil people (due to trauma, and he has every reason to), yet his blind hatred of all Amestrians IS wrong, because there are many innocent Amestrians.

- The systemic issues present in the USA are really only present in the USA. I have lived on three different continents, including Africa. I have been told time and time again that ""white people have all the power everywhere"" and that ""there is not one place where PoC are systematically advantaged."" I am strongly convinced that those arguments are born from extreme ethnocentrism from Americans who are not even aware that there exists a world outside of the USA. In MOST countries in the world, white people are a minority, and while they are often seen as a ""model minority"", they don't have more power in my native Senegal or in China or Japan or India than Asian-Americans have in the USA.

- The systemic issues in question, even if only look within the USA, were not born by accident. They are the result of the fact *the majority of the population held bigoted beliefs* for long enough for those beliefs to become ""mainstream"". That's really all it takes. If the ""white people are all trash"" and ""kill all men"" mentalities were to become more popular, they WOULD absolutely shift the systemic imbalances to cause systemic discriminations against white people and men respectively. I'd argue that, on a small scale and in some specific contexts, this is already happen.

Until Trump made the poisoning blood comment, I disagreed with accusations saying Trump is racist as he somewhat drew a clear line between attacking someone based on their race and based on immigration status or religious beliefs. But man, ""poisoning our blood""? This is a dangerous statement not only because was used by the Nazis but also because it implies certain blood is ""clean"" and certain blood is ""poisonous"". Trump did not specify what blood is clean but it can be easily deduced from the demographic of the crowd listening to that statement. He could have easily got out of this controversy if he stated Europe as an example for a source of poisonous blood but he decided to obly mention Africa and Asia.",leapingfro9,995,1247,0.6899999976158142,0.4664250397888311,1702934532,/r/changemyview/comments/18ljydd/cmv_trumps_comment_saying_immigrants_are/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-18 21:22:12

First off dreads originate from African regions dating back thousands of years and hold a religious and cultural significance, furthermore Buddhist, Christian and Hindu religions wore dreadlocks. Moving forward in time vikings adopted this hairstyle and at some point through time most cultures/ethnicities used this hairstyle. So dreadlocks aren't just subject to black culture there subject to most if not all cultures. I dont believe that someone shouldn't be allowed to have a hair style because it's part of someone's culture. Just earlier I saw people hating on a white woman for having dreads saying cultural apropriation this cultural apropriation that but if u look at its definition cultural appropriation is HATING or MOCKING the culture for what they chose to wear and I think that's wrong.

18rl1qx,CMV: It's really weird that the Holocaust has been completely claimed by Jews,"Just a few to things to make 100% clear. I am absolutely not denying that 6 million Jews were killed in an attempt of genocide by Nazi Germany. This is not an attempt to revise the Holocaust or deny any part of it. Quite the opposite, actually. I am also not saying in any way that Jews cannot or should not claim victim hood. They were massively victimized and are still today. These are not part of my point at all.

Something that's been bothering me for a while is that the Holocaust has been broadly accepted and talked about as purely a genocide against Jews. Most people I know who I've talked to about WWII or the Holocaust think that there were only (relatively speaking, of course) 6 million Holocaust victims. This is not true. There were 6 million victims who were Jewish. There was another 5-6 million who were not Jewish, but disabled, LGBT, and non Jewish ethnic/racial minorities. Anyone ""degenerate"" or ""inferior"".

You may be wondering why it matters. Here's why it bothers me:
1. Nearly half of the victims of the Holocaust are practically erased by only focusing on the 6 million Jews. It's not right to suggest 6 million is inflated and it's not right to only speak on half of the victims of the Holocaust, in my view.
2. Fascism of all kinds have similar strategies and talking points, but the Nazis and Hitler gained a special level of hatred among the general population, seemingly globally. Only focusing on the anti-Semitic propaganda and tropes causes us to miss propaganda and tropes of other groups from the same source. This is happening in the US towards several minority groups, but the parallels are ignored because we're not educated on ALL of the trash Nazi Germany pumped out and perpetrated.

To change my view, you need to explain why my concerns are moot and/or that the other 5-6 non Jewish deaths are not as ignored as I feel they are.

Also, I'm an American speaking on what I experience in America and online in mostly American communities. I don't know how Holocaust education or discourse is outside of the US.

Edit: I figured this wouldn't take too long. I had assumed that other groups were treated just as bad as Jews were, but that was incorrect. There's also the fact that the Jewish population is the only group victimized that did not significantly recover from the same event. Also, I didn't realize that ""Holocaust"" is literally a term used for the Jewish deaths exclusively and the other murders are considered separately. These things have changed my view.

18h3pt5,CMV: There is little a man can do to protect himself from false rape / sexual assault allegations,"For emphasis, this view is about **false** rape allegations.  Obviously, a man can protect himself from factual rape allegations by not raping.

I'll use gendered language in the is post, but genders can be reversed.

I can think of two types of false rap allegations:

1. Malicious allegations.  These are situations where a woman knows she wasn't raped, but makes the accusation as some type of vendetta against the man, or to protect herself from ridicule or negativity.

2. Mistaken allegations.  These are situations where the woman fully believes she was raped, but the situation that occurred does not meet the legal definition of rape.  Legally, she validly consented to sex, even if she regretted granting that consent later.

For malicious allegations, there is essentially nothing a man can do to protect himself.  Even avoiding sex all together doesn't protect against malicious allegations.  Some malicious allegations could be avoided by making specific efforts to not piss women off, but that does little for, say, a situation where a woman falsely claims rape because she doesn't want her parents to know she consented to sex.

Mistaken allegations provide for more avenues of protection for men, but at some point you just have to take your partner at their word that they are consenting to the sex and are consenting for the right reasons.  So ""repeatedly checking in and reading body language"" is really the best protection for men attempting to avoid mistaken false allegations.

But if your partner is telling you that they want to have sex (either with words or actions), when they really don't want to have sex, what is a man to do?  It's reasonable to take her at her word, but you never really know if she's consenting because she wants sex, or if it's because she is afraid of what you'll do if she says no, or because she had a couple glasses of wine, or because she thinks it means you'll be her boyfriend.  And if it turns out to be some reason *other* than that she actually wanted to have sex, the man is at risk of being falsely accused.

Note that the examples I provided above as protections a man can take to avoid false rape allegations fall within the ""little"" a man can do.  So responses of ""look at your own post, there are lots of things a man can do"" won't sway my opinion.",THEpassionOFchrist,279,1888,0.5799999833106995,0.3916103053116025,1702429498,/r/changemyview/comments/18h3pt5/cmv_there_is_little_a_man_can_do_to_protect/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-13 01:04:58

And sure, maybe the sample is self selecting because I do see it mostly online.

However I don't know how it isn't true.

And I think its kind of true  I've tried experiments. With older profiles and younger ones. I look the same and yet the younger age gets more matches. Its a scary thought that men, no matter how old THEY are dont want older women with experience.

18tm3i8,CMV: Social media is destroying western society slowly like a cancer.,"When people spend so much time looking at what other people are doing, they lose all creativity and chase what is “cool”. They’re wasting time on their phone accomplishing nothing other than increasing their jealousy and anxiety while they can be spending that time being productive. All independence and privacy has gone out the window to oversharing and following meaningless trends. 

TikTok is the worst iteration of this. The algorithm is specifically made to influence young people’s worldview. From the moment you create an account you’re bombarded with dangerous messaging. Gen Z is completely addicted to this, and the platform is now where the youngest generation is receiving their news. Why does China have a different version of TikTok? It’s almost like they know it’s poison, so they don’t want to give it to their youth, but are happy to give it to western youth. There are obviously also concerns about the Chinese government using this app to steal personal information from its users.

18enrh2,"CMV: The criticism of Hitler's paintings as ""ugly"" is not based off of the quality of Hitler's art itself, but rather, the critics' dislike of Hitler as a person.","You would be hard pressed to find a single art critic who holds a neutral or positive view of Adolf Hitler's paintings; they near-unanimously criticize his paintings as *ugly, lacking talent, lacking merit,* etc.

Now, whether one likes Hitler's paintings or not is entirely subjective (you can Google them for yourself and see what you think of them. Most of them are sketches or paintings of buildings, architecture, mountains, scenery, etc.) But I can't help but suspect that the real reason Hitler's art is criticized so heavily by art critics is because they are afraid of the political consequences of saying anything remotely positive about it, especially in the era of social media and cancel culture.

To put it another way, if, say, Barack Obama, Greta Thunberg or Martin Luther King Jr. had painted those **exact same** paintings - or if you showed Hitler's paintings to some art critic without that critic knowing who the painter was - I strongly suspect those same art critics would either hold a neutral/noncritical view or be praising the paintings/sketches as *artistic, beautiful, well-drawn,* etc. 

Whether Hitler's paintings are good or not has absolutely nothing to do with him being a genocidal tyrant.

This is a large part of the reason why i loved Obama despite not being a democrat. He was the perfect leader. Physically and mentally strong, brilliant and charismatic to a fault. He was a damn near perfect human being, regardless of his policies.

- Upper age limit should be 65, not 50

- I don’t know how to measure how smart someone is. I know IQ tests suck. I will have to delta you if you make me try to actually implement this as opposed to dream it. I will still hold thag only smart people should be allowed to run

18fx9i0,"CMV: Biden / Dems have failed immensely by not raising taxes on the wealthy, which would be beneficial to the United States economy","Dems campaign heavily on taxing the ""rich"" and reducing wealth disparity.  However we have seen basically none of that.  I think taxing the rich would reduce wealth disparity, reduce inflation, and lower the deficit, and would be overall a boon to the US economy at large, and that Dems have totally failed to implement any laws to do this in spite of their promises to do just that.

I am not necessarily talking about anything like the 90% taxes like we've seen historically, or even necessarily a ""wealth"" tax.  Even something like increasing capital gains tax to match income taxes would be reasonable, and increasing the top brackets / creating new brackets for people making 10s of millions.

To clarify my points: taxing the wealthy:

A. Would reduce the deficit

B. Would reduce inflation without taxing the poor/middle class

C. Would reduce wealth disparity and many of the negative symptoms of it

D. Could be implemented in a reasonable, measured way

E. Is something the Dems have routinely promised and failed to deliver, and these days they fail to even bring up the topic

F. Fiscal policy is extremely important and the Dems are at best clowns and at worst immoral in failing to address it.

At the risk of getting away from the subject, I would also argue that many of the topics Dems focus on pale in comparison to the importance of good fiscal policy, and Dems pander with social issues instead of fixing economic issues that would have magnitudes higher benefit to the poor and middle class they claim to champion.

I would also argue Trump failed by slashing taxes during a booming economy prior to the pandemic.  The Republicans are obviously don't even pretend to want to raise taxes on the wealthy, which is why I didn't bring them up.

18t6eoz,Cmv: The majority of people supporting Palestine in the west don't know what they are really supporting.,"I will start out by saying the Palestinians have been mistreated by Israel and surrounding Arab states and need a state but I believe Israel has a right to exist. A 2 state solution which I think is the majority view of people in the west not involved directly in the conflict.

When the college presidents were before Congress being wishy washy about the calls for genocide being a violation of the code of conduct I really believe one of the reasons was to protect there students. With the river to the sea slogan when used in the past and to certain extent today by Palestinians means a call for all Jewish people to be removed from the area and I dont think students really are aware of that so I don't think the majority of them chanting it were actually calling for genocide in their eyes even though through a lot of peoples eyes they were. I don't think students should be exspelled for not understanding the full context of a slogan and I think the college presidents understood that. A lot of students had no idea what river and what sea it was even referring too.

Another big thing I see is the right of return and a call for democratic state where both people live together I personally don't see how this doesn't end horribly for everyone involved if you snapped your fingers and made this a reality tomorrow. Even a structured right of return not overnight would end in escalation in hostility between both groups that would be a net negative for both people in my opinion. This is an amazing dream for well into the future but this is not a reality now. To give an example imagine if Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi people all returned to there homes from before partition and they were all one state do you think that goes well at all? I wish in perfect world it did but that's not the reality. I really don't think a lot of people protesting in the street realize the consequences that full right of return would have with tensions being so high.

My last point is some people portraying Israeli's as white and Palestinians as non white. I think most of the people in general would not be able to pick out who was Palestinian or Israeli in a line up. This I think comes from Americans ideas on race which don't really apply to this conflict and makes me think a lot of people saying this have never actually met a Palestinian or Israeli or even read up or watched anything longer then a Instagram story on it.

And in the same way as that slogan, perhaps someone just means the South will recover economically or culturally or whatnot.

In exactly the same sense, yelling out a slogan about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which is entirely consistent with the Hamas Charter, which originally included a quote about rocks & bushes yelling out ""a jew is hiding here, kill him"", is too ambiguous for someone to seriously claim it's not intended (at least when Rashida Tlaib & others say it) to threaten Jews w/ genocide.

This picture is quite similar to [Dresden's bombing](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/181z60z/map_of_dresden_bombing_in_ww2_which_was/), [Cambodia's bombing](https://data.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/dataset/402115c8-03aa-4ae3-8609-ae993632f941/resource/02cd54f0-5bd0-47a9-ae8c-6d14da4a5de8/download/us-bombing-1965-75.jpg), and  [Laos bombing](https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/16b8zfm/map_of_the_bombs_that_were_dropped_on_laos_by_the/). Nearly *all* infrastructure in Gaza City, used by militants or not, are destroyed, fitting the definition of indiscriminate bombings. 

A few things to address:

* If you want to say that ""only"" 20,000 died, suggesting a low death to bomb ratio, fine, but bombing campaigns are aimed at *infrastructure*, so as long as the kind of infrastructure attacked is indiscriminate, the campaign is indiscriminate.

* If you want to say Hamas hides themselves in civilians, I'm referring to infrastructure used by militants _or not_. Unless you believe that 95%+ of all buildings in Gaza City are used by militants, then it's indiscriminate.

* Don't bring up genocide. I'm not accusing Israel of genocide in this post, so I won't entertain that rebuttal.

To close this out, here are some quotes:

> “There is one and only (one) solution, which is to completely destroy Gaza before invading it. I mean destruction like what happened in Dresden and Hiroshima, without nuclear weapons,” Moshe Feiglin, the founder of Israel's right-wing Zehut Party and former Likud representative in Israel’s parliament

18qcgj9,CMV: People who perceive intellectual conversations as douchey and pretentious are idiots who are just insecure and feel the need to prove their superiority,"I cannot even count how many times I have tried bringing up intellectual topics, or even simple things like analysis of a painting, a movie or any other kind of art form, and whenever I use any word that is a bit uncommon or try to bring some nuanced perspective in the conversation, people either feel the need to one up me by disagreeing with some irrelevant argument, or just clock out of the conversation and call me a douche behind my back. I have also tried doing these things without making other people feel excluded and explaining ideas in a simple manner, but seems like most people just care about surface level discussions and somehow think discussing anything in depth makes you a pretentious narcissist.  
And this is not just limited to personal experience. In most scenarios, people club anyone bringing up anything remotely intelligent as pretentious and feel the need to one up the person by clubbing him/her into categories like r/iamverysmart or something similar. Its such a disgrace. I also feel like this stems from an anti-elitist mentality but even that is harmful for us as it hinders innovation and lateral thinking.  


However I agree that I may be wrong, so please feel free to give reasons as to why this kind of behavior is justified. And like I said, this is not just from personal experience even though that plays its own part, but this is a sentiment I have seen being echoed very frequently no matter which kind of circle you are in, so please keep that in mind as well before criticizing me or assuming that somehow I am a douche who is trying to justify his actions by calling other people out.

As a result, they were persecuted and put into death camps the way Jews were under Nazi rule. It's estimated that [250,000 to 500,000 Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_Holocaust) were murdered, about 25-50% of the Romani population at the time. A scholar even estimated that 1.5 million Romani might have died out of a population of 2 million. 

I did not learn about this until recent months, and I'm sure many reading this post aren't aware either. Their Holocaust was only recognised by West Germany in 1982, and many official recognitions only came about in the 2000s. The reason for that is complicated but probably due to a combination of strong anti-Roma racism in Europe, especially Eastern Europe, the lack of collective memory and the lack of documentation.

I think that every time we talk about the Holocaust, we need to recognise that it's not only the Jewish people that were genocided, the Romani people were too and need to be addressed together.",GoSouthCourt,874,273,0.8600000143051147,0.2702745755235205,1703458272,/r/changemyview/comments/18q5tdv/cmv_the_romani_holocaust_organised_by_nazi/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-24 22:51:12

They also make arguments for emulating how other countries control guns. (UK, Canada, Japan). While at the same time saying they don’t want to ban guns. I find this contradictory because those countries have guns banned. So if you make that argument you’re essentially arguing to ban guns. 

I wish more gun control advocates would be honest with themselves, with everyone else and admit they want guns banned. Instead of using mental gymnastics of “common sense” gun laws.

While not *real* children, the designs for these children are clearly and undeniably derivative from real life human children. I.e. Kobato Hasegawa, a popular loli that has a very clear child’s body proportions and behavior. 

This is why anyone, even someone who doesn’t watch anime, can watch a lolicon anime and recognize that these characters are human, and which characters are children - without having to be told. 

It’s visually apparent to everyone because it clearly derives from real human children and everyone knows what that looks like. 

The sole defining characteristic of the genre is the sexualization of specifically prepubescent girls. The fact that this aspect is the defining feature of the genre is because prepubescent anime girls make loli fans aroused. As I have shown that lolis are based off and designed to resemble human children, this is pedophilic.

18kj9d0,"CMV: We should spend more time helping people who are poor, than obsessing over race & identity.","By ‘poor’, I am encompassing anyone who is struggling, or living hand to mouth right now. Mainly for the sake of brevity. 

For the past 10 years the rhetorical focus of governments, charities and corporations alike has been on race/gender/sexuality. And poverty has taken a back seat in the conversation.

A cynic might point out that ‘fighting’ some amorphous spectre of ‘racism’ with a few D&I schemes is much cheaper for the Goldman & Sachs’ of the world than actually trying to solve wealth inequality.

The best argument for the focus on race has been to look at outcomes. Minorities tend to have disproportionately worse health care outcomes, education, incarceration etc. 

But in the U.K. at least, when you control for socioeconomics, these outcome gaps disappear almost completely. With white children even fairing worse than minorities with respect to education outcomes.

It would seem that the racial inequality we see today is largely the result of wealth inequality, rather than deliberate racism - institutional or individual.

Instead of focusing on helping the poor, we spend our time teaching wealthy kids they are ‘oppressed’ because of the identity group they belong to. Creating a atmosphere of paranoia, assuming every other person is a secret racist/bigot. 

By focusing on wealth inequality not only would we materially help the same minorities we want to support (as they are status more likely to fall into that bracket).

18ukstx,cmv: It is not possible for there to be “equal” reproductive rights between men and women.,"
So would consider myself to be pro choice when it comes to abortion rights which is a position that needs not much of an explanation. I do see a lot of people talk about giving men the right to “financially abort” their child in an attempt to even the playing field when it comes to reproductive rights. I think this is not a good idea. I think that it is not realistic to strive for equality in this situation.

Firstly the outcomes are different. I’m not going to get into the weeds if when a baby becomes alive or whatever. Frankly I don’t really care. I’ll just be honest. If a woman decides to get an abortion while her partner doesn’t want her to. The woman still reserves the right to get an abortion or not because it is wrong to force the woman to carry a pregnancy she does not want to because the man who knocked her up said so. The it works reversed as well, it’s wrong to force a woman to get an abortion.

Now let’s look at the other side which people are worried about. A man wants to not have a kid, but the woman doesn’t want to get an abortion. I think we can all agree it’s barbaric for a man to be able to force a woman to get an abortion. So she doesn’t get an abortion. Now things change. There is a child. The child has to eat, has to wear clothes, and be taken care by the parents.

It been observed that it is best for a child to have two active parents for financial and time reasons. Removing the other financial stream impacts the child above all else. That’s bad. And because there is now a child present the parents have to take some form of responsibilty, whether they want to or not (for both parents).

So now you can say this is unfair, however I think that given the nature of how child bearing works, it’s not possible for there to be equal rights because there isn’t an equal distribution and an equal end result when someone is pregnant without either making it so that women are forced to physically carry a baby she doesn’t want to carry, or robbing a child of much needed fincancial support.",Left_Sense_3060,288,1054,0.6899999976158142,0.252512949076727,1703957484,/r/changemyview/comments/18ukstx/cmv_it_is_not_possible_for_there_to_be_equal/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-30 17:31:24

Instead of connecting people like they were supposed to, dating apps have instead created a hookup culture, which there's absolutely nothing wrong with, but this culture is def not conducive to long-term relationships. 

Also, especially in a tier-1 cities as an average guy, dating is getting really really expensive. Going out to even a decent restaurants is something many are barely able to afford.

18d19gr,CMV: Making fun of Incels is Cruel and Makes the Problem Worse,"I really shouldn't have to clarify some things before I get into it, because I think the ideas are all that should matter and I really am an armchair philosopher in this way where I think of society as a dinner party where we're just talking about things but I'm aware for many people it's not like that, and I also don't want to be accused of anything ridiculous. So, I'm not at all sympathetic with the ""incel"" cause or whatever that is. Many say very hateful things that should not be said, many act violently, etc. As far as I undertstand it, those that most fervently identify with the term, skew towards hatefulness.

My general impression is that they're, for lack of a better word, ""losers"" in a sense. The bottom of society etc. And because of that, I feel a great deal of pity for them. I think this sense of having ""lost"" and the judgment they feel is probably somewhere at the core of their hatefulness, and I think the media and people generally who use the phrase as a putdown, do ***absolutely nothing but aggravate the problem.***

If you're going to hold a view analogous to ""society's ills are systemic in nature"", which is a view that I hold, then making fun of someone for being an incel is the worst possible thing you could do. If your understanding of the problem is that people, almost always men, who can't get laid because they're almost always some combination of poor/ugly/weak/awkward/antisocial and we decide these things and decide that they're bad because of some combination of genetics/environment/evolution/society/blah (and I really don't mean that as an insult, more a statement of fact) that's a horrible thing to do! 

Instead, the problem should be viewed dispassionately, in one sense, and compassionately in another sense. But never, passionately hateful in retribution, which is how I see this group treated.

18lnxlf,CMV: Incels cannot influence movie box office numbers and cause flops in the way that is constantly claimed on social media,"I want to start by saying that I completely understand that incels exist, and that they can cause many issues for everyone; not just for the women they target, but also for men that get in their crosshairs.

One aspect where I am not believing that they have any meaningful influence as portrayed on social media: **movies and box office numbers**. Every time a movie comes out with a female lead and/or majority female cast, or a ""diversity casting"" as they constantly complain, if that movie flops, you have people screaming ""incels didn't watch the movie because they are scared of women, so of course it became a box office flop! But it's a great movie!"". If a movie is cast with a male lead and it flops, we usually do not hear the same rage from social media that ""<insert group name> did not like this movie because <reasons> and that's why it flopped"", as compared to when incels are brought up.

We have had some stellar box office numbers from female-led movies (e.g. Barbie, great film, loved it) and we've had some flops (from both male and female actors). Notable recent flop that made me want to bring this up: The Marvels. I saw the movie in the cinema when it first came out, really enjoyed it, but it was not a packed room on the opening weekend. Every time someone brings up ""incels are to blame!"" I usually answer ""why didn't women go to watch this movie since they want to support women in movies so much?"". Zero meaningful opposite responses, every time. The movie had decent Rotten Tomatoes scores, and was reviewed mostly positively elsewhere.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe that the number of incels that exist, that can influence movie box office numbers, is a statistically meaningful number. Not men in relationships (since incels are not in relationships), just incels that get constantly blamed for movies flopping. Even if incels complain on social media to try to ruin a movie by review-bombing it, it is pretty obvious when that happens; I have yet to see proof that review-bombing even works with these box office flops.",sinayion,608,446,0.8199999928474426,0.2314363833208279,1702944720,/r/changemyview/comments/18lnxlf/cmv_incels_cannot_influence_movie_box_office/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-19 00:12:00

I understand where African-Americans come from when they say they weren’t taught about African history, empires, and world changing events, so they feel left behind when compared to how other societies and empires are taught in America; particularly Britain, Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and the Aztecs even, but this Afrocentrist idea of “they were all black before the modern people invaded and stole from our black ancestors” is becoming increasingly problematic social media issue and seeping over into real life. 

This all may seem out of the blue but as an Italian man, I’ve been seeing that “the original Italians were black” popping up across my feed, after seeing countless “the Greeks were black”, “the Egyptians were black”, “the Chinese were black”, “native Americans were black”. 

After getting into the classic instagram comment argument, the common argument is that, at least for European people and societies like the Greeks, Italians, and even the British; claiming that since Western Hunter Gatherers were darker skinned people than modern European populations, that these African-Americans can claim these people and societies as their own despite not being genetically, linguistically, culturally, historically related to them in anyway.

To sum it up. I think that this needs to be addressed either by better education on who these people, societies, and empires were and their modern descendants, and that sub-Saharan societies, people, and empires need to be better taught in the American educational system to combat against “claiming the next best thing as our own since we don’t know our own”.

Project 2025 provides a blueprint for purging the federal government of career employees and installing trumpist loyalists.  We’ve never seen anything like this in modern times.  They’re currently vetting 54,000 extremist loyalists for these jobs, using AI to do it.  This is certain not to end well for the country.  Trump’s flat-out said he’ll be a dictator “on day one”, and it’s been reported by multiple sources that he plans to use the Insurrection Act (which may not be reviewable by courts) to make the U.S. military his own private Gestapo—deploying them domestically to violently crush peaceful protesters, occupy blue cities, and persecute the media and political enemies.  Does anyone seriously think he’d have any compunction about seizing voting machines in the next midterm election to prevent Dems from winning (the way he tried to in 2020, but was talked out of it by people with more restraint, none of whom will be around next time)?  I know many previous elections have claimed, rightly or wrongly, that “democracy is on the line”—but in this case, a clear and detailed picture is showing us exactly how it obviously is.

Are left-leaning people ok with trump using the FBI and other alphabet agencies to lock up journalists and anyone who opposes him, on a scale never before seen here?  Do they care about what could happen to DACA recipients, LGBTQ people, or Palestinians here (whom he’s threatening to deport for their criticism of Israel)?  Do they think Congress (which is likely to be controlled by his lackeys if he wins), or a judicial system stacked with right-wing judges, will be willing to stop him—or even able to enforce its decisions if he ignores them, the way his role model Andrew Jackson did?  Do they think life will somehow just go on as it has been?  Do they think it’ll be no worse than last time, despite the lack of guardrails or any need to exercise restraint for the sake of reelection?  Do they see him promising to “root out” the “radical left vermin” and think, “Oh, it’s fine; he doesn’t mean me?”  In fascist regimes, leftists are often the first up against the wall.  Why do so many left-leaning people seem to be ignoring the clear historical parallels between this and fascist catastrophes of the past?  And why do they seem unconcerned about what would happen to Palestinians (or for that matter, Ukrainians) if trump is allowed to get power again?   
Whenever I bring up the danger of trump’s incipient fascism in debates with people who say they won’t vote for Biden, they seem to either wholly ignore it, or dismiss it with the facile, evidence-free claim that it’s just a “bogeyman” invented by Democrats (despite many of the sources being trump’s own words and his current and former employees.  Even trump’s former DHS chief of staff and former Defense Secretary, among many others, are warning about it).  Maybe this is just my experience, but I have yet to hear anyone who says they won’t vote for Biden offer any kind of practical plan for how to deal with the fascism that’s likely to result from letting trump win.  
Call me crazy, but I thought leftists and progressives opposed fascism.  So why do some seem so entirely blind to the danger of clearly rising fascism in this country?  Are they truly unaware of it?  Can they really not pay attention to more than one thing at once?  Is there no way, \*at all\*, to oppose current U.S. foreign policy, except by selling out all our rights and enabling a fascist with an even worse foreign policy?  And if the outcomes are likely to be worse at home and abroad, how can enabling trump be helpful to either Palestinians or the anti-fascist cause?  
I’m not so much interested in arguing, here, about whether people should vote for Biden.  I’m also not interested in hearing overly simplistic, propaganda-laden declarations like, “Oh, I just can’t vote for genocide,”—nor in debating whether that’s even an honest term for what’s happening.  If you’re a left-leaning person who won’t vote for Biden, what I’m looking for is a detailed explanation of what your \*practical, concrete plan\* is for stopping or limiting the damage done by a trump dictatorship, along with the fact that SCOTUS would remain in right-wing hands for even longer into the foreseeable future, as a result of empowering him.  (In your response, remember that protests are likely to be crushed by the military, and future free elections are also in doubt).  How does allowing him to win provide anything resembling a viable path to a better future?  
And for those whose answer is “accelerationism”—meaning they want to encourage a brutal dictatorship and all the suffering it’d cause, because they think it’d spark an armed revolution—I’m looking for \*practical\* solutions, so miss me with that theory, unless you can show how it’d be a \*practical, viable and effective\* course to take—one that’d actually \*reduce\* suffering, compared to electing Biden.  If you can’t show that convincingly, you’re just ineffectually fantasizing as far as I’m concerned.  Same thing if you advocate voting third-party and expect sufficient numbers of people to somehow suddenly join you—unless you can show how that’s a \*practical\* plan to beat trump, it’s not a valid response to my question.  
So how about it?  Do anti-Biden leftists \*only\* oppose the current carnage in Gaza, and they’re fine with anything trump might do domestically, or overseas in the future?  Or do they also have a \*practical\* plan for stopping fascism that doesn’t involve electing Biden?  I’m genuinely curious.  When I’ve asked people this question previously, I occasionally get a verbal shrug, or dismissal without any backing, like I said—but I usually just hear crickets.

18kt6of,CMV: all drugs should be legal,"I have two arguments for this:

1. The government should not have this much control over its own citizens, to decide what the citizen consumes. We pay our taxes, and we are sovereign individuals with our own will. If a person decides that they want to destroy their health with drugs, then that’s their choice. And as long as that person isn’t committing crimes, then it isn’t the government’s business. And while you could argue that the government has banned drugs to preemptively reduce crime, you cannot hold people fully accountable for their choices while simultaneously steering them into one direction. 

2. Alcohol is one of the worst drugs to exist. It’s highly toxic, destructive and sometimes lethal. Withdrawal of alcohol can be lethal for some addicts, and it is highly addictive. To ban certain drugs, even those that are less dangerous than alcohol is illogical. And the only reason for alcohol even being legal, is because of cultural norms. Similarly, the only reason other drugs are illegal is also cultural.

If someone wants to alter their brain and feel better, then weed or shrooms, which are almost completely harmless, are a much better alternative.

18uib7l,CMV: The rate at which words evolve to be unacceptable in any context has been increasing and words should never have so much power over us that they are unacceptable regardless of context.,"I had a bit of a false start with this one for a multitude of reasons, the most significant of which were not censoring the language I used and combining two different topics that really ought not have been combined.

I chose not to censor the language partly because despite every other major subreddit that I'm aware of doing so, the mods here do not censor language, something that I view favorably. I also had used these words on this subreddit prior in a similar context (speaking about censorship) in a comment that was well-received. I truly was not expecting the initial reaction I received and I was not trying to offend anybody.

After a conversation with the mods, it would seem the best course of action is to separate my two topics of conversation entirely. I'm still choosing not to censor the language. If my language offends you or makes you uncomfortable, that is indicative of exactly what I am speaking about. I'm essentially asking you to ask yourself why exactly that would be the case and ultimately, the deltas available will revolve around you explaining to me why the emotional reaction you're experiencing is correct.

The last time I posted this, it turned into a bit of a shitshow immediately. While I'm not one to phone the internet police, the mods here are pretty anal about keeping their threads clean so please keep Rule 1 (top-level comments must challenge my view) and Rule 2 (don't be a dick) in mind in your responses.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qm68p/cmv_nigger_is_a_bad_word/) is a link to the previous thread. There are several replies of mine that can give you a decent idea of where my head's at and you can even bring quotes of mine from that thread in here to use in your replies if you like.

*

I have been alive to witness at least a bit of the evolution of the word faggot. When I was growing up, it was essentially used synonymously with asshole or douchebag. I remember vividly an interview Eminem gave about the Marshall Mathers LP (2000) when I was 13 in which he said ""When I say 'you faggots keep egging me on' I don't mean 'you gay people keep egging me on'"" and I remember thinking 'I can't believe he just had to explain that.'
 
Now faggot is just as derogatory as nigger and it would seem retard is fast approaching if not there already. There was also backlash against both [Lizzo and Beyonce (and Weird Al!)](https://slate.com/culture/2022/08/beyonce-renaissance-lizzo-spaz-ableist-slur-lyrics-history.html) in recent memory for using the word spaz.

Even this website has evolved. When I first arrived (2013), both faggot and retard were commonly used in various memes, and while I can't remember ever coming across nigger (worth noting that it may have been auto-removed by most subreddits since the site's inception though I can't know that) I do recall people casually throwing around nigga now and then. Now this subreddit itself is the only major subreddit I'm aware of that does not censor language and have all posts that contain any of these words removed automatically.
 
The N-word has been the N-word since I've been alive. I was not present to witness its evolution but I would have to imagine it went through something similar. I never questioned it because for me it had always been part of my established reality. But having now witnessed this evolution happen myself a couple times along with the threat of it continuing to happen more, it does give me cause to question if words evolving to have so much power over us that they're unacceptable in any context and being essentially forcibly removed from our vernacular is the correct direction. Something about it gives me '1984' vibes.",Aggressive-Carob6256,396,530,0.6800000071525574,0.1913473870422155,1703950826,/r/changemyview/comments/18uib7l/cmv_the_rate_at_which_words_evolve_to_be/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-30 15:40:26
18ro656,cmv: I think we as a society should be doing more to prevent young men from becoming incels,"I’m saying this as someone who pretty much was an incel from ages 16 to 21. I think society is failing young men in many ways that result in the growth of incel like ideologies and why there’s been a mainstream success of red pill influencers in the vein of Andrew Tate and his acolytes. I think there should be a level of empathy extended to incels. I’m a firm believer that just about everyone deserves a chance to change, and in the case of most incels, the worst they did was post some shitty things online

I feel this way because my experience as an incel taught me that what I wanted wasn’t sex. Sex was just a symbol. What I actually wanted and what actually tormented me was that I didn’t feel like the type of person who could have sex.
I didn’t feel important to anyone, I didn’t feel desired, I didn’t feel attractive, I didn’t feel like I would escape how I felt as a loser teenager.

I was never affirmed. I was never told I look handsome except occasionally by my grandmother. I never got any attention from women my own age and as a result, I felt hopeless and ugly. 

I think that this is becoming more of an issue as dating and romantic/sexual interactions and dynamics take new shape. Women have the majority of the power in it now and men weren’t taught to adjust. I grew up thinking id have a normal dating life but as the hands shifted and women’s standards in what they want in a man physically and emotionally became out of my ability it broke me. 

I’m not saying women need to lower their standards. It’s human nature of women to pick from the top and not really acknowledge the scraps. But I do think boys need to be better equipped to deal with things and given the emotional support men haven’t gotten.",Similar_Charity9248,231,755,0.699999988079071,0.1872099047901112,1703640610,/r/changemyview/comments/18ro656/cmv_i_think_we_as_a_society_should_be_doing_more/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-27 01:30:10
18kajht,CMV: Blaming Bad Policy On 'White Men' Is Wrong And Politically Stupid,"I've been mulling over a topic [after reading it here](https://www.nationalmemo.com/ken-paxton-2666596245) and I think deserves our attention: the counterproductive and politically naive trend of blaming complex societal issues solely on 'white men'. This isn't just about being politically correct; it's about understanding the deeper, nuanced factors that contribute to policy decisions and societal changes.  
  
Consider this: Blaming 'white men' as a homogenous group for the challenges in reproductive rights or other social issues oversimplifies the problem and alienates potential allies. It's essential to remember that characteristics like gender, race, and age aren't opinions or ideologies. Yet, we often see this generalization, especially in certain left-leaning circles and media. For instance, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski repeatedly criticized Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, focusing on his race and age rather than his actions or policies.  
  
Let's take a step back and think about this. When we reduce individuals to just their physical attributes, we miss out on engaging in more meaningful, policy-focused discussions. It's easy to forget that people of all backgrounds can hold a variety of views. Texas Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar, for example, votes against abortion rights. Would it be fair or accurate to reduce his stance to his ethnicity? Certainly not.  
  
This trend isn't just unhelpful; it's politically harmful. By alienating groups, we risk pushing them towards opposing political agendas that may not align with their interests. Remember, the Supreme Court justices who established Roe v. Wade were predominantly white men. It’s about perspectives and policies, not just physical attributes.  
  
Moreover, this kind of rhetoric can be easily weaponized by political opponents. When we engage in this oversimplification, we inadvertently provide ammunition for figures like Donald Trump to rally against us, further polarizing the political landscape.  
  
So, what should we do? It's crucial to focus on policies, actions, and ideologies rather than resorting to broad, unhelpful stereotypes. Complex issues demand complex discussions, not reductive blame games.  
  
What are your thoughts on this? Have you noticed this trend, and how do you think we can shift the conversation to be more inclusive and productive?  
  
Looking forward to your insights and discussions!

18o0ha9,"CMV: Censoring a non-crude word pertaining to a difficult subject, like 'rape', is ridiculous and a category error.","I very recently saw an infographic about abortion laws in Europe by country, describing the permissibility of abortion and in which circumstances. It was a broadly informative or at least serious and non-frivolous infographic. And yet the word 'rape' was censored to 'r\*pe' in the legend -- in the context of 'abortions allowed in case of rape'.  
  
This is very far from the first time I've seen this sort of thing; in fact, it seems to be everywhere these days, and I'm mystified by it. What is going on with the censoring of normal words that pertain to difficult subjects? And how has it gotten to the point that in informational charts that's seen as an acceptable thing to do?  
  
I understand censoring words deemed to be crude or offensive, like 'fuck'. I understand as well that if I were writing a blog post and I thought my audience might be triggered by difficult concepts, I might give a trigger warning that rape will be discussed.  
  
I don't understand in the least who is being served by censoring the word itself. The word 'rape' is not a bad word. Rape, of course, is abominable. But the word 'rape' is not -- i.e, it's not impolite or crude to say the word.  
  
I see this all over the place now, but only very selectively applied. You never see 'murder' censored to 'm\*rder' or something, though I'm sure we all agree murder is abominable as well.  
  
And if the idea is indeed to censor the word so as to avoid someone being 'triggered' by it in some way -- well, censoring one letter of it won't achieve that at all, will it?  
  
There seems to be a category error going on, in which people are **censoring** the normal and accurate word in lieu of **censuring** a very terrible act. But that's completely bonkers, in addition to being infantilizing!

There's a real danger to the idea that one ought to censor a word pertaining to a difficult topic, instead of censoring crude words meant to degrade or be offensive. 'Rape' is not a word meant to degrade or be offensive (though of course the act is infinitely offensive -- obviously no argument there); instead, the word is a normal, accurate descriptor used up to and including in legal terminology to describe a heinous act. Censoring such a word is madness, not least because if it becomes the norm to do so, one might well be censured themselves for using the word uncensored. What irony.  
  
So, perhaps I've missed something. If so, CMV, Reddit. ",Ad_Captandum_Vulgus,596,138,0.9100000262260436,0.1761399454488477,1703201152,/r/changemyview/comments/18o0ha9/cmv_censoring_a_noncrude_word_pertaining_to_a/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-21 23:25:52
18t5hpd,CMV: Homeschooling should be way more heavily regulated if not outright illegal,"Homeschooling can sound like a good option to some people. Parents know their kids best, and can give their child all the attention they need and not be split among a whole class like a teacher is. That’s the idea at least. But in reality, that is not what happens most of the time. 

In most cases homeschooling is just a way for parents to have complete control over their kids lives and abuse them more easily or indoctrinate them into their own religious/political beliefs. We’ve all heard the horror stories of kids being unschooled and unable to even spell their name even as a 10 or 11 year old. Obviously cases this bad are not common, but the very fact that this is allowed to happen in the system AT ALL is a sign that it needs to be reformed. [Of parents who homeschool 75% say they do so to provide moral instruction. 59% do it to provide religious instruction.](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/tgk/homeschooled-children). Now you can criticize public schooling, but it certainly doesn’t fail to provide a moral backbone to kids or equip them to think critically about their own moral views and expose them to many different ideas. This makes me believe that these parents aren’t dissatisfied with public schools because of good faith criticisms of its curriculum, but because they don’t teach their own religious or political views as fact. Kids are not the property of their parents, they have a right to a good education, not an indoctrination into their parents’ ideas. Homeschooling often does not provide the wide variety of people and worldviews that defines public schooling and creates kids who cannot think for themselves as adults. 

Homeschooling also often fails to provide kids adequate social connections to other children. This is important not just for their own personal growth, but for them to learn what a “normal” childhood is like. It’s a lot easier to believe that parental abuse is normal if you don’t meet many kids who don’t experience it. It’s another form of control given to parents who usually are not trustworthy.  [Parents who engage in child neglect or educational mistreatment are more likely to use homeschooling as a guise.](https://digitalcommons.cwu.edu/source/2013/oralpresentations/137/). 

I am aware that academically homeschool kids tend to do a little better on standardized tests. But this only makes me more concerned, as based on the other data  it seems like parents are teaching for the test and not the actual skills the test is trying to measure. The point of social studies classes is not to know in what year Columbus crossed the ocean, but rather how to think critically about history, parse through information and different sources, and synthesize information to come to their own conclusions. Public school doesn’t do this perfectly, but it is at the very least the goal, unlike homeschooling for many people.

On the other hand, there are a significant minority of homeschooled kids who are due to having special needs, or from having suffered some negative experience at school that makes them feel unsafe. I do think this is a legitimate reason to homeschool, but I’d still like to see these types of kids returned to public school once the system has found better means to teach these kids and prevent abuses.

Ultimately I think this comes back to control. I think homeschooling gives parents way too much control over their kid’s life. Traditionally, kids were raised by and taught by the entire local community. We evolved to learn that way. Modern schools allow for kids to learn from a wide variety of people and curriculums are influenced by the entire community or nation. But homeschooling gives all that power to one or two people, who even at best are flawed human beings with blind spots. If you have a bad teacher at a public school it won’t be long before you’re in a different class with another teacher, and you have some mechanisms to remove that bad teacher. If your homeschool “teacher” is bad, there is almost nothing you can do and they teach every class. That’s just a bad system to put the future of humanity into.",LineOfInquiry,394,430,0.7099999785423279,0.1738799294133882,1703799916,/r/changemyview/comments/18t5hpd/cmv_homeschooling_should_be_way_more_heavily/,2023,12,changemyview,2023-12-28 21:45:16
18bgaur,CMV: I think the existence of God is unknowable.,"As the title says, I believe the existence of God is unknowable, which makes me an agnostic. I have been looking into the issue of the existence of God and I have noticed either 2 (or 3) types of proving that God exists and these are as follows:  
1.  Arguments for god's existence that end up being debunked/don't actually prove what they try to prove  
Take for the example the ontological argument, which states that God is the greatest thing we can imagine, i'd not be great for it to not exist, therefore it must exist, which can be refuted by simply replacing God with anything, like a floating island full of riches or a world where everyone lives in harmony, Just because i'd be better for X thing to exist, doesn't mean that it does exist. Or for example the cosmological argument (at least for Aquinas), which states that physical things exist now, which means that something non-physical had to bring them into existence and that something is God. But, this doesn't prove say the Christian God, that non-physical thing could just as easily be the universe, this argument just doesn't prove God.  


2. Arguments for god's existence that rely on unfalsifiable hypotheses (in the vein of say the Invisible Pink Unicorn, or the Flying Spaghetti monster or Russell's Teapot)  


An example of this would be the theological argument, or at least how some like to reply to counter-arguments to it, with this argument saying that nature looks designed, therefore it has to be designed and defenders of God usually say that is because of his omni-potent and he made the world in a way that aligns with his omni-benevolency. But why do rabbits have tails that hunters can shoot at them? Why do hurricanes, floods exist? Why do we have blind spots in our eyes and other bodily imperfections, among other things, while some say that this is because we got punished. But if he did indeed have his omni properties, we couldn't have done the first ever sin and why would a very good God create creatures that didn't share this goodness? Also, it is likely that the Adam and Eve story isn't even real and is just myth, Evolution, not creationism is the theory most grounded in scientific evidence. Although, a conclusion that can be drawn is that there is a God that is not within the bounds of space time, that does not care about us just because he is morally gray, he is everywhere and everything, or many other things that just make his existence an unfalsifiable hypothesis that just doesn't satisfy anyone, like heck it just makes the belief in him as legit as believing in the Flying Spaghetti monster.  


3. Oh faith cannot be argued for or against, you just have to look for it yourself (fideism, the Leap of Faith)  


Some, like Kierkegaard say that faith ain't something that should be grounded in reason, its like a Leap of Faith in Indiana Jones, there is a big deep gap between the two cliffs and he (Jones) can't jump over it, but there is possibility that there is one, a 50/50 one. Keep in mind though, this is possibility. Heck, there is a 50/50 possibility for anything, the probability may as well have been 1% for there to have been a tiny bridge and there may have been an even slimmer chance for him to have made onto it and heck is Indiana Jones really a good example? Heck, the course of his character is determined by a God technically, that being the film's creator, but whatever. The Leap of Faith exemplifies the absurd source for meaning in this cold, meaningless universe that will most definitely not succeed, as Camus said (yes, I do believe in absurdism). The fact is, even if faith is something that does not rely on reason as per fideism, it still doesn't solve the issue of God. If he is beyond our space-time realm, he is everywhere and everything etc., cannot be detectable, smellable, tracable, he doesn't care about us or his creation and whatever other properties we assign to him then there is to be no difference between a God and no God at all and even if we were truly under such God and not under just a universe and not some being, which we don't know then the absurd still exists but that's a whole other topic.  


Still, I am willing to have my view changed, whether it would be to fully dismiss God or to somehow bring me back to him, like basically the goal is to fill this hole of unfalsifiables and bring it, the truth to me so that I can have a clear position on this once again.

And there is a flavour for any type of young person, e.g:

1aeuoo0,"CMV: A major reason the Trades are dying is not because younger people are lazy, but because the work culture is awful and no one is willing to train apprentices.","When between jobs previously, I had occasionally considered working in the trades. I enjoy working with my hands, and I think some trades such as electrical work sound very interesting on top of that. However, one thing always stopped me. When I was younger, I used to work security on a few construction sites and noticed something that put me off the trades permanently.

The work culture was just beyond awful. Plenty of verbal abuse (screaming curses, insults, and slurs) from bosses towards the apprentices, plenty of racist, sexist, and homophobic talk, and plenty of generally nasty behavior across the board. It didn't matter which site I was at, or which company was working there, there was a similar trend.  This was only half the issue though - the other half I noticed is that for all these construction companies and tradespeople complain about their dying industry, none of them are even willing to train anyone as an apprentice unless they're a family friend or paying for it through school which presents the same issue of accessibility as university. Half the people at those sites were perfectly competent men who were working for total peanuts as temp laborers in the desperate hope that they'd get chosen as an apprentice.

And, you know, who honestly wants to do any of that?

You can call me weak or a snowflake, and that's fine, but the fact of the matter is that younger generations overwhelmingly don't want to deal with that kind of work culture. I am sure many people would be willing to do a trade, if it was actually accessible work without grinding away your body at dangerous temp labor work in the vague hope of getting chosen and if the industry wasn't rife with casual bigotry of all kinds. If the trades are so desperate for new blood, they should work to be a more welcoming and less abusive environment.  I am aware that making mistakes in trades work is much less acceptable than some other industries, but employers don't need to be abusive in order to get this point across and should be focused on teaching and fostering new talent to continue the most important work in human society instead of pushing away anyone they deem emotionally weak because of dudebro locker room culture.",funwithdespair,2068,680,0.949999988079071,0.6276755538865941,1706637491,/r/changemyview/comments/1aeuoo0/cmv_a_major_reason_the_trades_are_dying_is_not/,2024,1,changemyview,2024-01-30 17:58:11

Why would doctors conduct this completely unnecessary procedure? It doesnt matter if the parents are religious. No doctor should say yes to mutilating a body unless the baby clearly needs it done medically

I believe doctors should not do elective surgeries on children when the child literally has no say in the matter. I can imagine some elective surgeries should be allowed on children if the child has a strong desire to do so. However babies can not consent.

Not only that, it’s almost certain that no child would strongly desire genital mutilation. And even if they strongly desired it, the doctor should still think twice about executing on such a surgery.

1afie1j,"CMV: The Palestinians' fear of getting ethnically cleansed is very real and valid, and it needs to be taken seriously.","It was reported yesterday that 11 cabinet ministers and 15 coalition members of the Knesset attended a conference calling for a ""voluntary migration"" plan of Gazans. Let's call a spade a spade, this is textbook ethnic cleansing. It's no different from when the US ""asked"" Native Americans to move to reservations, or when Soviets conducted population transfers in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. There's no ""voluntary"" here when their homes have been destroyed by the IDF.

The people attended this conference were not some fringe figures as well, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich were both there, they are the Minster of National Security and Minister of Finance respectively. They are also in the war cabinet. Despite the fact that the government has denied these plans, it remains true that these people have real power and real influence in the government. 

When it comes to public perception, the plan is not deeply unpopular or fringe as well. 33% of Israelis support the resettlement and annexation of Gaza and 56% oppose it. Governments all around the world have implemented policies much less popular than 33%, just ask Netanyahu's protestors last year. A proposed policy that only a slim majority of Israelis oppose has a very good chance of becoming actual policy if the political climate changes, even slightly.

If you're a Palestinian, I think it's valid to have fears of being ethnically cleansed from your homes when the climate in Israeli politics is so in favour of such a policy. We need to recognise that and take concrete steps to reaffirm that that's not going to happen, by drawing red lines, or punishing problematic officials, etc.",WheatBerryPie,1063,1608,0.6499999761581421,0.5589267387241597,1706709332,/r/changemyview/comments/1afie1j/cmv_the_palestinians_fear_of_getting_ethnically/,2024,1,changemyview,2024-01-31 13:55:32

But these parents were the parents who would force their kids to go to church on Sunday, force their kids to read the Bible, force them to pray, force them to go to religious summer camps, shelter them from outside influence, etc. - in many cases, also heavily censoring what their kids were allowed to read or watch. If anything, the upbringing that they raised their kids was even more focused on instilling a certain message or agenda of the parents' preference in the kids' minds than anything the schools did. Somehow all of their raising of their children this way didn't count as ""indoctrination,"" but the schools or media promoting a pro-LGBT message was ""indoctrination.""

1ach425,CMV: The idea that Wikipedia isn’t a reputable source is a myth bred from the school system.,"We all have heard from teachers that we can’t use Wikipedia because it “isn’t a reputable source.”

In reality, teachers only say that because of how easy Wikipedia makes assignments. And any smart person *still* used Wikipedia for assignments.

You simply scrolled to the bottom and clicked on the sources that were linked, then cited those in your work, even if you just got the info from Wikipedia.

As a website developer myself, who even once put up a fake news website to humor my friends, anyone can make a website. So nothing is really reputable if it’s not peer reviewed.

Teachers accepted non-peer reviewed articles, and articles listed as sources on Wikipedia, but not a Wikipedia link itself. Simply because they knew it was too easy.

192eqb6,"CMV: It is now in men's best interests to stop using dating apps, disconnect from them entirely, and force society to find a new way for people to meet and date.","39M here, FWIW. The culture of dating apps has established itself in such a way that men have arisen as the unequivocal losers in this game, basically like playing a football game where you start being down by multiple scores and it's already the final quarter of the game. 

We all know the statistics: men get about [1 or 2 matches a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/11btxok/men_how_many_matches_do_you_get_a_day/?rdt=52564), across all dating apps. That's going to be roughly equal to the number of LIKES they get since most men are liking the vast majority of profiles they see, a strategy they are probably justified in using since there's no point in being selective with so little working in one's favor. Women, on the other hand, get [hundreds of likes a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/163amr9/how_many_matches_for_women/?rdt=42121), all of which can translate into a match if they so choose. If I conservatively pick the number as 200 matches a month, that means women are having ONE HUNDRED TIMES THE SUCCESS THAT MEN ARE HAVING. One. Hundred.

That's clearly a losing game for men. So why should we continue to participate? Clearly it is in the best interests of men to collectively agree to stop using dating apps, to delete each and every one of them from our phones and, I dunno, at the very least force us to meet people the old-fashioned way, by meeting people at bars, getting set up with a friend of a friend, asking out your cute coworker, etc. These options are all on the table right now, obviously, but a lot of women aren't even leaving themselves open to the opportunity because they know they've got their ace-in-the-hole on a dating app somewhere. So why risk things with your coworker or do the socially awkward thing of approaching that dude at the bar when you can just rely on these dating apps to do the guesswork for you on whether the dude is even available and if he's interested in you?

It's a losing game for men and we men should collectively agree to stop using dating apps completely. Keep in mind that my viewpoint is not so concerned with how FEASIBLE it is to suddenly get all men to stop using dating apps; it's more about what I think would happen if we could snap our fingers and make it happen. But also, I don't consider it to be completely NON-feasible, since generally it is easier to not do something than it is to do something, right? If I can do my part to do my fellow men a favor, of course I will do that, and I think this move right here is in our best interests.

1991b9g,CMV: The trouble young men are having with dating right now is exaggerated and mostly caused by stunted social development rather than anything young women are doing.,"It has become common in certain online circles to complain about how many young men are single. It does seem to be true that singleness among young men is particularly high right now, but the reasons for this are not what many dejected young men say they are.

Those in the so-called ""manosphere"" or the various ""pilled"" communities generally blame women for their singleness. They accuse women of ""hypergamy"", IE dating men of higher social status than themselves. They accuse women of having unrealistic standards and say most women will only date a man who is over 6 feet tall with an income above 100,000 dollars. Some end up just hating women in general. 

I do not think these people are correct. What I see is a generation of young men who, relative to previous generations, rarely go out of the house and rarely socialize with women in real life. So many young Gen Z men are socially and even physically under-developed because their primary sources of recreation and socialization have been virtual for their whole lives. When you talk to these young men in real life it is clear that they have not developed the social skills and hobbies necessary to interact normally and healthily with women they're attracted to. Moreover, the way these young men talk about women online makes it absolutely clear that they do not regularly interact with a variety of women in real life and do not have a realistic understanding of women.

To put it simply, most women are not interested in dating socially awkward and physically under-developed men who spend all day on the Internet. I think we can all understand that and accept it as normal.

How big is this problem really? Online, it's huge. In real life, I don't think it's all that serious. The great majority of these dejected young men eventually grow up, acquire real life jobs and hobbies, and learn to interact with women like human beings. Once they do that, they generally find women much more interested in them and live a perfectly normal life.",Grandemestizo,682,1383,0.6800000071525574,0.4245631626465113,1705510461,/r/changemyview/comments/1991b9g/cmv_the_trouble_young_men_are_having_with_dating/,2024,1,changemyview,2024-01-17 16:54:21
19brluv,CMV: Sex offenders with more then 10 victims should be chemically castrated and sterilized for the betterment of society,"As harsh as it sounds I really do think it’s necessary. Nobody stumbles into the life of being a serial rapist. It’s not like some sexual assault cases where there’s some, if not nuance, then grey area. To be clear, the assault happening is unjustifiable and wrong no matter what, but the college frat boy who rapes a girl while she’s passed out at a party is different from a predator following a woman to her job, her gym, her house, waiting for a moment to kidnap her and get his rocks off. More time, planning, obsession and in some cases violence go into the latter type of offender.

The frat boy, in most cases I’ve seen, is opportunistic. They want sex. They’d prefer it consensually but if the girl is drunk and too fucked up to say “no” they’re fine with that too. Serial rapists however, they get off on the lack of consent. They get off on the resistance. They want the person to scream, fight and try and run. Domination is inextricably bound up with their sexual desire. 

Did anybody watch The Last of Us on HBO? Well, there’s a character just like that in the show. Someone that gets off on resistance. Someone like that can’t be reformed, retrained or redeemed. They’re wild dogs. And even if you could “tame” them, it’s still too risky in my opinion. A drunk who relapses will likely hurt themselves, either via alcohol poisoning or just your run-of-the-mill self-destruction of their lives. A junkie will likely be the same. Though the risk they betray a friend or family member and rob them for a quick fix is also a factor. They too are more likely to just OD and die.

A serial sex offender though? If they relapse someone is getting raped.

That risk is too much for me. Humans are animals, no? If an untrained/abused/mentally ill dog bites two or three kids, not matter how much their owners might love them, they’re getting put down for the benefit of society according to the state. Even if you could put them on meds or put them in a different environment there’s always the risk that down the line something could set them off and then it might not be a bitten kid you’re dealing with but a dead one. I feel like this is a happy medium for the criminal justice reformers and the tough-on-crime crowd. Because when the offender is “fixed”, we release them from prison free of the “urges” that would make them want to attack someone again, we save billions of dollars that would be otherwise spent on feeding and housing them, and the “law and order” crowd can sleep soundly knowing these guys are castrated and, though they’re free, will remain on a list for the rest of their lives.

1acfvhn,CMV: Men are becoming more conservative because progressives refuse to talk about men's issues.,"The way I see it. There's few people who want to speak to men about the issues the face in a way that doesn't either center women or blame men. I took multiple feminist studies classes in college and something I noticed as the only man there was that how patriarchial standards harm men was also said as a footnote, minimized, or implied that men were holding the boot on their own heads. 

As a man born in 2001 who has literally no political or socioeconomic power other than my own ability to vote, I could easily see how this would be frustrating. I feel there are issues I have to deal with that women do not have to. I also feel that it's not other men that cause 100% of those issues 100% of the time. A lot of women who believe they are feminists don't want to acknowledge this because they feel conceding any point to women having any aspect of life easier than or playing into certain patriarchial roles anti-feminist and pro-men.

Men are struggling to date more and more. I mean I saw some statistics that men age 18 to 30 were twice as likely to be single than the same age group. Many young men are struggling to find romantic partnerships. The ""feminist"" view to that is to tell them that they're not entitled to romantic love. The Petersonian view is that men are struggling and they should be allowed to feel what they feel and it is a problem that so many men are lonely. g that hates you.

With this I think there's been a bit of an overcorrection to casual misogyny that women specifically in my generation do where they call for an end to casual misogyny (valid and correct) while combating it with casual misandry. Again, seeing both of these views perpetuated by what you believe feminist are and by someone who calls themself a feminist, you're not gonna want to look into it. You'll view it as something counter to you and something that hates you.

This is such a common belief that the average man's exposure to ""feminism"" is likely going to be from social media and turn him off from feminist ideals. I mean why would he? If some 19-year-old dude keeps seeing online that not only is he oppressing women but he's also the cause of his issues, he's not gonna see feminism as a positive thing. st, you're not gonna want to look into it.

19dyanb,"CMV: The ""Free Market"" doesn't work with goods and services that are necessary to sustain life. An choice of purchase or die is not a free and voluntary exchange entered into by equals, its an ultimatum.","I think the free market, such as it is anyway, works pretty well for about 90% of the normal consumer good related market activity most of us engage in.

The ""free market"" breaks down, it's internal check and balance mechanisms, become self destructive, when the good or service is one that cannot be refused on pain of death or substantial material deprivation. 

This is why healthcare, housing, and food are so often the ones that require the greatest government intervention to stabilize and are most prove to radical exploitation is left to their own devices. Everyone needs to live somewhere, and everyone is eventually gonna need a doctor, everyone has to eat, and one cannot freely opt to refuse these services, well you can, but in the same way you can freely choose to not give a mugger your wallet and get shot. It's not a ""free"" choice, it's a coercion and an ultimatum. It is widely accepted that a choice made at spearpoint isn't a free choice. Whether that spear it literal or in the form of not being able to afford insulin.

Without the consumer being a free agent, able to enter into an exchange with the purveyor as equals, able to arrive at a mutual beneficial transaction, the inherent self-correcting mechanisms of the ""free"" market break down, because at that point the market, at least the market for that good or service, is not free. It is obligatory. 

When a good cannot be refused, on pain of death or severe material deprivation, the purveyor is free to jack up the price as high as they wish, they are free to price a large swathe of people out of the market entirely, accepting their demise as chaff if it means the profit they pull in off of the substantially higher price on fewer transactions still proves more fruitful than lower profit on more transactions.   


There are only two ways to address this. At a certain point, people, as in the bulk of the people, the mass of the people, will not merely accept dying cause their job doesn't pay enough. That state of affairs will eventually lead to civil unrest of uprising. Which of course will see a breakdown of the market. To avoid this happening, an institution, usually the government, must put their hand into the transaction in some way to ensure the populace has access to the service, either by subsidizing the purchasers or placing price controls on the purveyors. 

&#x200B;

But long story short, in the case of an obligatory good or service, the market can never be free. The choice is coercive to the buyer by default, and can only be corrected by institutional intervention, or dismantling the market entirely (usually violent revolt). But all three scenarios are not free markets.",Jimithyashford,1014,592,0.8500000238418579,0.356317245206356,1706042224,/r/changemyview/comments/19dyanb/cmv_the_free_market_doesnt_work_with_goods_and/,2024,1,changemyview,2024-01-23 20:37:04
190eajj,"CMV: Anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic, though both Zionists and Anti-Zionists can be antisemitic","From the Jewish Virtual Library, Zionism is defined as the national movement for the return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. It is NOT just the self-determination of the Jewish people. To disagree with Zionism is not to deny Jewish people of their right to self-determination, but to resist the maintenance of **Jewish sovereignty** in **Israel** and maybe Palestine depending on which form of Zionism one is talking about.

It's not anti-Kurdish to say that Kurds shouldn't have their own state, or anti-Scot to say Scots shouldn't be independent in Scotland, or anti-Roma to say that Roma shouldn't be granted a state. Therefore it is not antisemitic to say that the Jewish people shouldn't have their own state. If, however, Zionism is PURELY the self-determination of the Jewish people, then anti-Zionism can be associated with antisemitism, but that's not what Zionism is.

Furthermore, saying that Jewish people shouldn't have their own state is not the same as saying Israelis shouldn't have their own state, just as saying Whites shouldn't have their own state in England is not the same as saying the English shouldn't have their own state in England. There is a leap of logic that Israeli == Jews for that equivalence to hold true. One can hold anti-Zionist position while believing that Israelis living in modern-day Israel deserve a state, which is also my position.

On top of that, it's not antisemitic to say that a people shouldn't have inherent sovereignty in a country. If someone says ""There should be White or Black sovereignty in America"", you are not a racist to criticise that person.

Lastly, no group is entitled to return to their homeland. Americans of German descent are not entitled to anything in Germany, the Romani people are not entitled to anything in northwest India. Chinese diaspora in Singapore are not entitled to anything in China. Singaporean Chinese can't just move to ShenZhen and start claiming the city belongs to them. I am not anti-German, anti-Roma, anti-Chinese for pointing all of these out, so why am I antisemitic for pointing this in Zionism out?

With that being said, there are anti-Zionists and Zionists that are antisemitic. On one hand, it's not uncommon to hear things like ""Zionists control the media/the bank"", ""Zionists are too rich"", etc. in the anti-Zionist camp, these are antisemitic statements and should be condemned. On the other, many neo-Nazi parties and fundamentalist Christians are vehement supporters of Zionism yet they hold some very antisemitic views. A report in the UK showed that the far-right are 3x more likely to hold antisemitic views than the average public.",ChezBurglur,531,1176,0.7200000286102295,0.3491885179161966,1704585913,/r/changemyview/comments/190eajj/cmv_antizionism_is_not_inherently_antisemitic/,2024,1,changemyview,2024-01-07 00:05:13
1ae4b6a,"CMV: No group of people in history would willing allow the enactment of anything like the Zionist project on their own land, and no group of people would, in the Palestinians' place, respond to Zionism with anything but hostility.","For me, the most frustrating thing about the discourse surrounding Palestine-Israel is the way in which the Palestinian people are routinely portrayed as irrationally extreme, violent, or anti-Semitic, when in fact their deep hostility to Zionism (and Israel in general) is the most obvious and predictable thing imaginable. I am convinced that **no group of people in history would willing allow the enactment of anything like the Zionist project on their own land, and no group of people would, in the Palestinians' place, respond to Zionism with anything but hostility.**

Imagine the following scenario in *your* country:

* A group of people are immigrating into your country in massive numbers, and *they have made it explicitly clear they want their own state on your land*. They go from a trivial percent of the population (\~2%) to almost a third of the population in around a generation. A foreign power retains control of your immigration policy and doesn't allow you to stop the influx
* As soon as this group arrives, they begin lobbying foreign powers to grant them their own state on your land. They'd love all of it, but they'll take as much as they can get for now
* They buy up land from absentee owners and kick off native tenants. They enact terms on the land that makes it illegal for it ever to be owned or worked by anyone but them ever again
* Eventually they succeed in making their case to the reigning superpowers: despite representing less than one third of the population and being mostly foreign-born, they are granted over half of your land — including half the coast and virtually all of the best farmland. Additionally huge numbers of your people will now have to live in their ethnostate, while none of them are expected to live on your side.

Given this history, the Palestinians rejected the 48' deal. Can someone seriously tell me that they are surprised? How do you imagine *your* people would respond? Do you really think that your people would have accepted that deal? 

Or, to put it differently, if the Zionists had wanted Connecticut or Cornwall for their state, do you think the US or UK would have considered that proposition for a single second? Do you think they would have handed over a single acre of their territory for a Jewish state? And if not, why should the Palestinians have been expected to?

Here is some additional evidence:

* The 30s and 40s were a massive litmus test of the Western world's decency toward refugees, and virtually everyone failed. There *were* hundreds of thousands of Jews looking for a home then, due to Nazism, and every single country turned them away. As an American, I think it is to our eternal shame that we did not go out of way to take in the whole of European Jewry, but if the US — a far larger and richer country with a much, much larger Jewish population (at the time) — was unwilling to open its doors, why are we surprised that the Palestinians weren't crazy about Jewish immigration, when it clearly meant the death of their society?
* I was once arguing with a Zionist about the right of return. And he said: ""Of course we can't offer them a right of return. It would mean the end of the Jewish nature of Israel."" He was right of course — that would be the result. He was also right to imply that *obviously* Israel is going to implement policies that protect it from being overwhelmed demographically; obviously, Israel is going to behave with the instinct towards self-defense that all functioning societies do. But to him the Palestinians were simply not human enough for him to have to consider the obvious: the entire existence of Israel is predicated on the Palestinians having been denied the right to do this very thing, to protect their society's integrity
* Far smaller rates of immigration create tremendous controversy throughout the developed world. Think about how controversial Muslim immigration into Europe is. Right now Muslims represent around 7.5% of France's population, after 80 years of immigration. In Palestine, in less time, Jews went from 2% to 30% of the population. And it's funny: most of the folks that are pro-Israel are also anti-immigration. They would absolutely lose their minds if they were made to tolerate the rates of immigration the Palestinians had to, especially if their immigrants were making it known they wanted their own country!
* In fact, I cannot think of a single country that currently allows the rates of immigration seen in Palestine in the early 20th century.
* I cannot think of a single people in history that has willingly allowed such a massive demographic change to take place on its land. If you can think of one, please, by all means, share.
* I cannot think of a single people who have willingly traded away any of their land for the sake of others' national aspirations
* I expect to hear the common Zionist talking point that ""There never was a Palestinian state, and Palestinian identity only goes back to the early 20th century."" This is undoubtedly true, but, for the life of me, I cannot understand what the implication of this is supposed to be. Are they saying: ""because the Arabs of the land of Palestine never had a nation state, it's okay to swap out their society for another one""? This logic looks remarkably like that used to colonize the Americas and Africa: they don't have a state, so they don't count politically. If this means something else, please let me know. But I can't make sense of it.",onstreamingitmooned,431,1185,0.6600000262260437,0.3267003917136546,1706557697,/r/changemyview/comments/1ae4b6a/cmv_no_group_of_people_in_history_would_willing/,2024,1,changemyview,2024-01-29 19:48:17

Well I live in a town with an obscene homeless population, one of the largest in America. 

Anti homeless architecture does not reflect how hard a city is trying to help their homeless people. Some cities are super neglectful and others aren’t. But regardless, the architecture itself isn’t the problem. I know that my city puts tons of money into homeless shelters and rehabilitation, and that the people who sleep on the public benches are likely addicted to drugs or got kicked out for some other reason. I agree 100% that it’s the city’s responsibility to aid the homeless.

But getting angry at anti homeless architecture seems to imply that these public benches were made for homeless people to sleep on…up until recently, it was impossible to walk around downtown without passing a homeless person on almost every corner, and most of them smelled very strongly of feces. But we’ve begun to implement anti homeless architecture and the changes to our downtown have been unbelievable. We can actually sit on the public benches now, there’s so much less litter everywhere, and the entire downtown area is just so much more vibrant and welcoming.

* Someone committing sexual assault is not their fault since they had autism, and trouble understanding boundaries.
* Palestinians wanting to genocide Jews is not their fault: they were driven to it by oppression.

These are not isolated opinions. These are not a few random crazies on the internet. This is what the discourse is now in spaces visited and influencing dozens (hundreds?) of millions. This is not an anomaly you can ignore and wait until it goes away. And it is getting worse.

190573g,"CMV: As an Asian American, voting for the Democratic Party is the only viable option for me, as they are the lesser of two evils","As someone deeply engaged in the upcoming election, I remain aligned with the Democratic Party as an Asian American, especially considering I reside in California. This state is the wealthiest in the nation and holds a remarkable economic standing, with a GDP that, if considered independently, would rank among the top 10 globally.

On top of that, the GOP has this habit of throwing around racist remarks, which just doesn't sit right with Asians. It's the kind of stuff that could be used against them, especially when we're talking about the surge in hate crimes against Asians.

While Asians encompass a rich tapestry of ethnic diversity, I want zero in on the ""holy Asian trinity"" (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) due to their numerous and influential representation among the Asian community. Democrats tend to lean towards supporting social safety nets and regulations, and this tends to resonate more with educated minorities.

Education holds immense significance in Asian culture, exemplified by phenomena like cram schools in East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan, where students attend supplementary classes to gain a competitive edge in entrance exams to some of the most competitive colleges in their respective country.

Drawing a comparison within the U.S., states under Republican governance tend to exhibit lower academic achievements than their Democratic counterparts. This discrepancy is often attributed to the Republican Party's inclination to reduce funding for education, resulting in lower academic outcomes.

While there is a consensus that schools could benefit from increased cost efficiency, the solution does not lie in defunding education.

1afvqlm,CMV: America is both overhated and underrated,"When America helps people or helps the world, nobody really shows any gratitude. And if we help in *too* much or in the wrong ways we get called cultural imperialists sticking our white noses into brown/black people's business and messing up their countries. If we don’t help enough, as the case shows in Rwanda or the current Latin American refugee crisis, we’re a callous, settler-colonial nation who couldn’t give two shits about the plight of the black man or the brown man suffering just beyond our borders.

The history of human life on earth is in large part a study of the various empires we created over thousands of years and based on our predecessors, I’d say if America is an empire, we’re by far the most benign and just the world has yet seen. We’re grading on a curve of course but does anybody else here reasonably think we’d be better under a Pax Russia? Pax China? Pax Britannia? How about the slave empires of the antiquity such as Rome, Greece, or any of the Islamic Caliphates? 

There should be some middle ground between giving the appropriate credit to countries that have made enormous strides in terms of lifting their citizens out of poverty, ending hunger and raising the standards of living while also acknowledging the role, where it’s appropriate, of the US in facilitating it. For example, China lifting hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty is a major humans rights achievement. China is/should be very proud of it. But it never would have happened with out the aid of US markets, US credit, and US help. And we should take pride in that as well. But liberals think they’re above the low hanging fruit of patriotism, “why do we even need to be proud of our country? That’s weird.” — because it’s so associated with the political Right.

18ynlm7,CMV: Identifying as Agnostic is more scientific and fact-based that considering yourself an Atheist while strict Atheism is not that far off from religion,"Hey everyone,  
so in my personal circle, many identify as atheists, an most of them reason that it is the most logical conclusion, based on facts and science. They argue that concepts like God and an afterlife are historical constructs born out of a desire to explain the unknown.  
My perspective differs. I think the most factual and scientifically backed stance on topics like afterlife, god-like entities etc. is considering oneself an Agnostic (aka I don´t know if a God or an Afterlife etc. exists, but I will not say that I´m certain that they don´t). I believe we lack the knowledge to assert certainty on these matters, distinct from claiming nothing of that sort exists. I'm referring to general concepts, not specific religions. Consider the questions science currently can't answer: the origin of life, the true operation of the human mind, and the purpose of human intelligence. And much more.

So at the end of the day, if you are saying ""No God exists, no Afterlife, all that is complete bullshit"", that is like defending a Religion to some point, since YOU DON´T KNOW FOR CERTAIN. You just feel better because you have fact based science behind your back (allegedly), not some old book. But that is viewing science backwards.

And I´m gonna make an argument with, you guessed it, science.

Here are the things we know (read know as in it is scientifically proven to the best of our current level of knowledge and understanding) and what that does this imply regarding the mentioned religious concepts:  
The universe didn‘t always exist. It was created or popped into existence at some point, most likely a few billion years ago. We don‘t know what caused that though.  
The laws of physics we base all our understanding of anything on, did not always apply, even after the creation of the universe (Plank Epoch). They don‘t even apply universally after that (Black Holes). And we have no idea of what was before all of that.  
We currently use two big theories to explain what we know about the universe, Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, and they conflict with each other. So what we do with those is always a approximation, no matter how well the models work.  
So, the laws of physics as we understand them today don‘t always apply, even within our universe, and our theories of explaining them are at the very least missing some key factor(s)we don‘t know of and they even could be entirely wrong.   
Also the universe did not always exist, which implies that there could‘ve been something before that (before is a complicated term to use here as time probably didn‘t exist, at least not the way it works now).  And that also opens the possibility that that „before“ didn‘t stop existing when the universe was created. So a state where none of the laws of physics apply, time doesn‘t exist etc., something that is literally unimaginable for humans, could exist outside the scope of our universe.We have no idea what is going on there, if this “plane of existence”, should it exist, or if it can interact with our Universe.  
So is there any proof of one or several god-like beings/entities or something resembling what we call the afterlife existing? No.  
Is there enough „wiggle room“ in what we currently know that there could be? Yes.  
Why is it considered to be unscientific to believe in that kind of stuff? Because we have no proof of it.  
Is the „not having proof“ thing kind of inherently tied to those concepts? Kind of, I think?  
Like, most established religions base their believes on stuff that supposedly happened a long time ago, where a god-like figure made connections with humans, which is unscientific. Believing in what the Bible, the Quran or the Torah says is unscientific, since there are way more plausible explanations why those religions were created and those texts were writtten etc.   
But what I‘m saying includes that it is not completely impossible that those books are right, for all of you guys out there who actually are practitioners of a Religion, but it is very far from just acknowledging that those general concepts could exist.  
And those concepts like god-like figure(s), an afterlife, a force outside of the universe that created life+intelligence+consciousness are not disproven by science by any means. I actually think categorically denying the sheer possibility of the existence of those things is human hubris at its finest.   
We don‘t understand our universe at this point, we don’t even know how far we’re away from understanding it, with all the scientific advances we have made over the last 10000 years. Will there be a Theory of Everything within the next 1000 years, assuming we don‘t get eradicated by something? No idea. Would a ToE solve all the mysteries of our universe or would it just lead to more questions? No Idea. Could there ever be a possibility to look beyond the scope of our universe, or is that a border that is inherently uncrossable? No idea.  
And this is the Universe we live in.   
How can we be sure what happens beyond the the scope of it?

1952r0z,CMV: Zombies Would Be Much Easier To Survive Than People Think,"We’re going based off the stereotypical zombie here. They’re slow, want brains and don’t have much of a consciousness. If you get bit, you turn into one.
That being said, I feel as though it may be earlier to survive one than people make it out to be. When pictured, people usually think of a post apocalyptic world but I think we could go about life pretty normally.
For starters, if this disease eats away at the host like it portrays in some media’s, it’s going to eventually get rid of their ability to see, hear, touch and even bite meaning they’re not really all that dangerous. Even if it doesn’t, and it only starts to infect the dead the only real threat are really only people who have recently passed away as their body has not been corroded yet, and likely still have full functionality. But I feel like this doesn’t make things all that harder because everyone would steer clear of the zombie once it first becomes infected, hence creating less infected and making it easier to contain. Again, the zombie is slow so you have plenty of time to react.
Suppose there is a hoard anyways, they don’t have much of a consciousness and will probably just follow whatever noise they hear if that sense still remains. So we can just gather them up with a large radio or something. But if it doesn’t work as planned, then just stay inside. They probably won’t recall how to use a doorknob let alone have the strength to open it. So as long as the windows are fairly strong you should be fine. If this disease removes an individuals senses, why not the rest of them? Meaning all we have to do is wait it out from here. Of course, food is an issue, but assuming you are at home, in a grocery store or mall we could just ration it. If not, then growing micro greens whilst you wait for other bigger plants to grow could work due to how long we can go without food. After the majority of the zombies are either caught or decayed we can return to our normal life. Even if there are some left, people will be more wary of it, so much so we’ll likely have a set of instructions on how to avoid or deal with a zombie when we see one.",Lost-Candy1084,510,373,0.8799999952316284,0.1933413399904559,1705085925,/r/changemyview/comments/1952r0z/cmv_zombies_would_be_much_easier_to_survive_than/,2024,1,changemyview,2024-01-12 18:58:45

1adsjhe,CMV: Black-and-white Us-vs-Them thinking prevents us from resolving most social issues yet is impossible to avoid,"*I am starting this one with a genuine hope that someone can change my view. Please, change my view, I really hate having it.*

This problem comes up everywhere, but I'll explain on the example of gender debate as it's what I'm most embedded in. I realise it's massive in politics but it's not what I'm focusing on here.

The one thing I battle with the most is the tendency to paint all men or all women as being this or that, and using it to justify dismissing them and their problems, saying they're not deserving of something, justifying being mean to them, discriminating against them while claiming they asked for it, punishing an individual for the sins of the group, and so on.

Very often B&W thinking is underlined by some painful personal experience with one person or more, which is then generalised to the entire gender. Sometimes it's super overt, like [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0g2drvCUYj/) (men think of their families, women only about themselves) or [here](https://medium.com/@donna.gratehouse/society-does-include-men-but-whenever-society-is-being-called-upon-to-address-mens-problems-it-s-6ea30fe2f4ac) (women want to help men but all they ever get in return is violence). Other times it's by implication, like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiDpvn77eqE&lc=UgyZ5Bm0GnM23wIQ5wR4AaABAg) (highlighted comment implying that all women want marriage and will make it a disaster for men) or [here](https://medium.com/@lelper/10-things-for-guys-not-to-do-on-dating-apps-5680ce34ffd9) (men are shit at dating, listing 10 sins which are hardly things only men do). I'm literally just picking a couple examples I've got fresh in my mind, but there are millions around. 

It's usually examples of the [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error). 

* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the good ones and everything **we** do is good or, if it's bad, it's because **They** provoked us or deserved it anyway. Meanwhile, when **They** do something bad, it's proof of their wicked evil nature.
* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the innocent victims and underdogs and **They** are the perpetrators in power.

Those basic narratives are so powerful and play so hard to the tribal thinking we evolved with, that it's incredibly hard to break out of them. The simplicity of this heuristic just makes it win with the complex truth that the world is not B&W but all shades and colours, that everybody is different and you can't just treat groups as monoliths. They might have power in this domain but we have power in another, many people in the group might have power but not necessarily this person, some of us are also pretty shitty sometimes while some of them are actually great, and so on.

Of course, there are many who know this. When you explicitly ask people about it, many will say this. But in practice, most still act and overwhelmingly think in terms of black-and-white. And it's a constant in human history - it's as much of a problem now as it was in Ancient Greece, we have evolved nothing.

What does this mean? It means that it is just such a bloody pain to get through to people! To help them stop spending so much energy on fighting each other and instead use it on making the world better for everyone. We keep fighting culture wars with imagined enemies and make everyone's lives miserable, while all it would take is to just stop and admit that there is in fact no us and them. That we're just all people who make mistakes and can get better.

But so I go, trying to promote this view, yet every time I feel like I succeeded on some small scale, I just see more and more of that everywhere else. It seems so inescapable.

This is more likely in europe because they are getting really good treatment compared to some other refugees from other countries so they are more likely to just stay and assimilate. The longer the war keeps going, the higher the chance of them not returning and assimilating

Second of all, aid is declining dramatically. US officials have stated that they would keep supporting Ukraine but not on the levels from 2022-2023. Decline in aid could have dramatic consequences for ukraine because they have gotten more aid in 2 years than the aid the USA gave the soviets in ww2(https://www.statista.com/chart/28489/ukrainian-military-humanitarian-and-financial-aid-donors/) so Ukraine is really depended on this aid.

I think the most recent one is gay marriage but, suffrage for virtually every group, climate change, social security and basically every hit button issue of the past i feel like are in the same boat.

Okay at the very top. I am fully aware that buying a woman a drink does not entitle a man to anything from that woman. That is not something I am here to debate. My point is that I think this is a rude thing to do. By the same token, I think the idea of sending someone a drink and demanding something in return is shitty. I'm not going to debate and argue about whether or not a woman could assume the drink is just a nice gesture. It's not. We all know this. I'm talking about real human interaction, not an academic debate. This is something everyone except severely socially inept (or what's more likely here argumentative contrarians) understand. If a man is offering to buy a woman a drink, 99.9% of the time it's because he's interested in her.

So I think that in a nightclub or bar, romantic interactions are pretty superficial. It's not an environment where ""getting to know someone"" thrives, it's based on first impressions which are mostly carried by looks. If a guy is good looking a woman may be interested, if not, he's SOL. So I think by the time a man says ""Can I buy you a drink?"" she's already made that first impression judgment and knows whether or not this is someone she'd be interested in. 

What I think is rude is when that judgment is a 0 and not a 1 and the woman accepts the drink.

190cmeb,"CMV: The Democratic Party platform of ""vote for us or lose the right to vote at all"" is not the strong ""saving democracy"" platform that party leadership seems to think it is.","Note: in this post I'm using ""democracy"" to describe any system of government where power is derived from legitimate elections. The debate about whether our representative form of government was ever a true ""democracy"" is another topic entirely.

The US has long had a two-party democratic system. Now, one of the two parties is openly un-democratic. They support a candidate who already attempted one coup to overthrow an election, and who openly wishes to be a dictator. So from my perspective, that party is no longer participating in the democratic process, which leaves us with a... one-party democracy? Is that even a democracy at all?

In 2020 Biden ran on the premise of saving democracy from Trump. Now, entering the next election, democracy seems *even farther* from ""being saved,"" and Biden is running on the same premise again. Frankly, it seems a lot like the rhetoric from self-labeled but widely accepted to be undemocratic regimes like Russia and China; ""you must vote for THE party or doom us all.""

It seems to me that the only way out of this situation is to create a viable third-party (or rather, 2nd party, if you assume that the Republicans are not participating in democracy). If the Democratic Party is serious about ""saving democracy,"" then they should be acknowledging the vast differences between their constituents (currently, anyone who still wants the US to operate as a democracy), dividing themselves into factions (sub-parties or new parties altogether), and forming a coalition of those factions to elect leaders through a democratic process (e.g. serious primary elections for president).

19a0ir3,"CMV: My teen spends much more time Online than IRL, and I believe it's an unhealthy balance that will impact his future relationships.","As a parent, I'm concerned about my 13yo son's social engagements, which is mostly online, through gaming. He has friends from school, but rarely sees them after school or on the weekends outside of school. I worry about the long-term effects on his social and emotional development as a person spending so much time online.

I'm in my late 40s, and grew up in a time before smartphones and online communities. In my experience in-person interactions benefited me greatly: getting a deeper understanding of friends through nonverbal cues, a sense of true connection with friends when you're just hanging out, and the opportunity for more meaningful conversations when there are fewer distractions around.

These things seem to be missing in my son's online interactions, which are often limited to in-game discussions about strategy, or even which game to play next, and then lack any in-depth (or even mundane talk) that happens naturally when you spend time together face-to-face. Also, he ends up meeting a variety of online-only friends and those relationships are more fleeting and never get that deep and real. I think spending more time with fewer, but real in person friends would be better for his social development. He'd have more opportunities to learn social skills - listening, empathy, resolving conflicts, social cues, etc.

I advocate for a much more balanced approach, ideally splitting his social time equally between online and offline. We already don't allow him to play games during the weekdays when school is on.

19fhzm8,CMV: No drug should “be tried by everyone at least once”,"I’ve heard it plenty of times by users, mostly referring to psychedelics but marijuana as well. I’ve tried these substances and experienced how potent they can be and alter your perceptions and outlooks for the better, but to say EVERYONE should give them a try is simply absurd.

Abusing psychedelics can lead to psychosis, HPPD, schizophrenia, worst case scenario a psychotic episode leading to death of the user or those around them. There’s a news article I saw getting popular recently about a woman having a psychotic episode off of marijuana and stabbing her boyfriend over a hundred times. 

Of course cases like these are relatively few and far between. Responsible users would take all of the necessary precautions to ensure the risk of an event like this happening is as minimal as possible, but not everyone is a responsible user.

196irbd,CMV: anyone who's serious about sustainability should change to a plant-based diet,"  
Studies have shown the best way for us to reduce deforestation, land use, fresh water use, eutrophication, and biodiversity loss is to change from omnivore diets to plant-based diets.  This is because animal agriculture is the leading driver of all of these factors, and switching to a plant-based diet can reduce them by as much as 75% (example source [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00795-w), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00343-4), [3](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216)).  Per the FAO, animal agriculture also emits more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector.  
  
We need to protect what is left of our biodiversity and change the way we interact with the environment. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) states we've lost an estimated [69%](https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/) of wild animals in the past 50 years, with losses as high as 94% in places like Latin America.  We've already changed the world so much that [96%](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1711842115) of mammalian biomass is now humans and our livestock.  
  
One of the most common rebuttals to the above is a plant-based diet isn't healthy, and therefore isn't a viable solution for sustainability.  In fact, it can be a major improvement over what many in the west are currently eating.  My country (USA) gets 150-200% of the protein we require and only [5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124841/) hit the recommended minimum daily fiber intake.  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the largest nutritional body in the world with over 112,000 experts, and [its position](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/) is a plant-based diet is healthy for all stages of life and can reduce the chances of getting the top chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers.  I say this to focus the discussion around other topics that are much more likely to change my view.

Corporations and governments won't lead the charge alone against the status quo, so it's important that we as consumers take responsibility at the same time.

The dominant diets in developed nations are based on societal and behavioral norms, but are far from optimal.  It's true that diet is a personal choice, so I hold it is better to choose a diet that is much more sustainable than what we're currently eating.

1999c5f,"CMV: Disney is not losing money over being ""woke""","A common notion I've seen from people (almost entirely conservatives) is that Disney is starting to do badly over ""woke"" content in it's movies. I am a progressive so there's an understandable bias on both sides, but I do feel I'm less biased and emotionally invested in this idea. I have little emotional investment in Disney and I acknowledge right wing money is a lot more plentiful and influential than left wing money.  
  
I'm not a Disney fan myself so I haven't watched much from Disney recently. The last Disney thing I did was go to Disneyland Tokyo with right wing family members.  
  
I don't perceive Disney as progressive at all. Pretty much every progressive person I know who isn't an animator hates Disney, and have hated Disney long before any right ring backlash against Disney.  
  
My perception is the MCU is too complicated for people to catch up with. That's the main reason I never watched any MCU movie aside from Guardians of the Galaxy and 2008 Iron man. Disney also quite possibly has issues of attempting to appeal to everyone and appealing to nobody, but I'm not sure about that over my lack of knowledge.  
  
I have never seen anything to particularly suggest Disney has progressive messaging in its media. The only political messages I've heard of are the really generic non-message of Black Panther and the genocide defending message of live action Mulan. I guess a bit more for their small cartoons like Owl House, but I don't see anyone suggesting Owl House had any impact on Disney's revenue.

America needs politicians who are willing to work across the aisle, who are willing to buck their party and get things done, who aren't blinded by the ideological-purity but are willing to look at practical results, and who care more about nation than party.

194axin,CMV: It Should Be Illegal for Politicians to Tell Blatant Lies,"This is Trump-inspired. I was just listening to Trump speaking to reporters not five minutes ago after coming out of his civil trial in New York where he has already been found guilty of massively inflating the value of many of his properties and holdings and they are determining what the punishment/fine should be. He stood in front of reporters and stated, time and again, that ""this was the new way Democrats were stealing the elections"" and repeatedly said that all of these trials and charges he is facing are being coordinated by Biden. 

I understand that the news media can rebut these claims and can follow-up his conferences with fact-checks, but I don't think that is sufficient as he is consistently allowed a megaphone in which he can state huge, incredibly damaging lies that hurt our country and there is no reprecussion for doing so. 

I do not believe that politicians should be held liable/that it should be illegal for them to tell lies in that for example, they say they will do ""X"" for their constituents but then that doesn't happen. What I mean is it should be illegal to make such incredibly damaging and damning claims when there is literally no evidence to support it. This is because the types of claims Trump is making are the type that can lead to true disarray, hatred, anger, and potentially even civil war if allowed to carry on unpunished. 

When Trump tells people that Biden is coordinating charges against him when there is literally no evidence of this his supporters believe it. And this type of claim is the type of claim that angers and infuriates his supporters. They truly believe that the election was stolen (even though he had many, many chances in court to prove his claims and failed in every single one) and they truly believe that Biden is somehow coordinating an effort to put Trump behind bars.

The simple fact is, Trump clearly was told by many, many individuals that there was no evidence of fraud in the election but he plowed forward with ""stolen"" claims anyways. He called the Georgia secretary of state and asked him to find just enough votes for him to win. He did all these things and there are consequences. He brought this upon himself, not Biden. 

Why shouldn't it be illegal for candidates to tell these types of lies? In a world where gaslighting the public leads to true national division, can we really continue to allow such dangerous lies to be legally okay? What is the end of this type of lying? Where does it lead? It can't lead anywhere good and it infuriates me that he is allowed to just straight-up lie without consequences.

I'm genuinely curious why it's okay for candidates to do this.",VTHockey11,324,335,0.800000011920929,0.1412355431658569,1705003330,/r/changemyview/comments/194axin/cmv_it_should_be_illegal_for_politicians_to_tell/,2024,1,changemyview,2024-01-11 20:02:10

Ignoring the fact that the US government would never in a million years even attempt this in the first place, even if they did, there are millions of unregistered guns that would just stay in the owner's possession and we'd never know.

Then you end up in a situation where all the registered gun owners have now given up their guns, but also know that most of the people they wanted to protect themselves from are still in possession of their unregistered guns, so the now gunless people will just find a gun via illegal means, and just keep it hidden at home.

1axovtd,CMV: For American Jews there is a de facto loyalty test to Israel to participate in vast majority Jewish spaces,"I'm an American Jew who was raised in the reform tradition. Been more and less connected to the broader Jewish community at various points in my life. As a grow older with a son of my own I would love to be more connected to the Jewish community, but I'm really turned off by the intense social pressure to uncritically support Israel. 

I don't agree with Israeli government policies both around Palestinians and the fact that Netanyahu is extremely right wing on many other issues as well. As a public school teacher my school is facing budget cuts because the government has ""no money"" but is sending Israel millions and millions of dollars every day. 

Besides that I'm an American citizen, I fail to see why my Jewishness should be contingent on my loyalty to a foreign country.  

When I go to mainstream Jewish spaces I feel intense social pressure to keep my mouth shut. If I were honest about my views I feel I would be ostracized. Mainstream Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation League have called Jews who dare to criticize Israel as ""self-hating""

I try to imagine this situation in any other ethnic group. Just imagining Chinese-Americans being called ""self-hating"" for not supporting the CCP. That would be insane. So why does it happen to Jews?

It was Hitler's viewpoint that Jews were secretly loyal to a foreign government. It's wild to me that mainstream American Jewish organizations have come around to essentially the same view - American Jews must support Israel or they are ""bad Jews.""

Anyway, I'm sad about what is going on Gaza - but also sad because I want to raise my child within the Jewish community and feel very disconnected right now.

1apr98a,"CMV: ""not all men"" is the socially righteous position to take","Statistics help show many facts as best as census data provides.

Some of these statistics show that in some places Islamic people are more likely to advocate Sharia. However, if you use these statistics to make generalisations about Islamic people that would be racist and inappropriate, because even a statistical majority does not mean that all Islamic people are that way. This kind of bigotry should be called out.

The same is true when people use statistics to say that black people are more likely to be criminals, or in gangs, and so on.

I don't mean ""men are evil creatures should be forced into camps and deprived of porn and exercise so they have to kill each other to get satisfaction"" vs. ""Women are evil creatures and it's up to men to punish them."" There's a big difference there- one belief was acted on the other has only ever been a disgusting fantasy. 

I'm talking about other things. A woman talking about beating up her partner vs a man talking about beating up his partner. Women and men are both victims of domestic violence, and the gap based on what I've seen is not large. But a joke where the man is a victim might get a ""yeah that's not really funny"" while a joke where the woman is a victim might get a ""disgusting misogynist."" Both reactions are disapproving, but one is a lot more intense than the other. It seems feminists almost view misandry as understandable but misplaced anger and misogyny as a horrible entity that needs to be eradicated.

1azmbbp,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,"
I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating.",GorrilaRuffy,308,1619,0.5699999928474426,0.3241326622721848,1708862489,/r/changemyview/comments/1azmbbp/cmv_dating_is_objectively_harder_for_men_than_it/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-25 12:01:29

Racism as a word, to me at least  simply means prejudice based on race. Any prejudice that is based on someones race or ethnic background is an example of racism.

Systematic racism is a form of oppression based on racial characteristics, and it’s true that white people have rarely been held under these systems.

1aoh83p,"CMV: Loli AND shota, although not illegal is still CP and I think you should try to get help if you like the category.","Alright, I know I'm on Reddit (home of the neckbeards) but in my defense, I am actually trying to get my view changed. If this discussion was already had please redirect me and I'll take this post down.

 look. I never understood why loli-cons just could not admit this. I don't think they should be arrested as YES it IS a drawing. This isn't hurting REAL children and I don't think they should be shamed for liking it. HOWEVER, loli/shota are still children. 

I thought this was common knowledge. That is the literal appeal. the fact that they look + act, and sometimes are children. (especially in Shotacon where they don't even use the 9000 yr old child excuse.), However, when I see people defending it, it is always trying to someone claim that either they are a child or it isn't a weird kink. both arguments I do not agree with. 

they are CLEARLY a child or at least trying to portray a child and are attracted to children, fictional, anime, cartoons, dolls. is WEIRD. 

I don't think these people are going to go out and hurt real children or look for real cp.  

and I do believe this regardless of the kink, but this is one where age or children are involved.  So I definitely think these people SHOULD try to get help. even if it is to just learn the reason being their kink so they're certain that they arent attracted to actual children.

1b2o53w,CMV: it is impossible to ethically accumulate and deserve over a billion dollars,"Alright, so my last post was poorly worded and I got flamed (rightly so) for my verbiage. So I’ll try to be as specific in my definitions as possible in this one.

I personally believe that someone would hypothetically deserve a billion dollars if they 1. worked extremely hard and 2. personally had a SUBSTANTIAL positive impact on the world due to their work. The positive impact must be substantial to outweigh the inherent harm and selfishness of hoarding more wealth than one could ever spend, while millions of people starve and live in undignified conditions.

Nowadays there are so many billionaires that we forget just what an obscene amount of money that is. Benjamin Franklin’s personal inventions and works made the world a better place and he became rich because of it. Online sources say he was one of the 5 richest men in the country and his lifetime wealth was around $10mil-$50mil. I would say he deserved that wealth because of the beneficial material impact his work had on the people around him. Today there are around 3-4 thousand billionaires in the world, and none of them have had a substantial enough positive impact to deserve it.

Today, there are many people working hard on lifesaving inventions around the world. However, these people will likely never make billions. If the research department of a huge pharma company comes up with a revolutionary cancer treatment, the only billionaires who will come out of it are the owners and executives. If someone single-handedly cured cancer, and made a billion from it, I would say that is ethical and deserved. But that is a practical impossibility in the world today. Money flows up to those who are already ultra-rich, and who had little to do with the actual achievement, in almost all cases.

On entertainment: there are many athletes, musicians, and other entertainers who have amassed billions. I recognize that entertainment is valuable and I do think they deserve to be rich, but not billionaires. That’s just too much money and not enough impact.

Top athletes are very talented, hardworking, and bring a lot of joy to their fans. I don’t think they bring enough joy to justify owning a billion dollars. If Messi single-handedly cured depression in Argentina, I’d say he deserves a billion. There’s nothing you can do with a sports ball that ethically accumulates that much money.

Yes, a lot of that money comes from adoring fans who willingly spend their money to buy tickets and merch. Michael Jordan has made over $6 billion in royalties from Nike. But I would argue that there is little ethical value in selling branded apparel or generating revenue based on one’s persona or likeness. It’s not unethical, but it doesn’t change the world for the better. MJ deserves to be rich but doesn’t deserve billions. I’m open to debate on this.

My general point here is that if you look at any list of billionaires, the vast majority are at the top of massive companies and profit directly or indirectly off of the labor of others. You could say that’s just how to world works but that doesn’t mean it’s right. I don’t think there is any person who has individually contributed enough to the betterment of the world in their lifetime and has also amassed a billion dollars. I am open to any particular billionaires and their work that might change my mind. I also should say that this is a strongly held belief of mine so I would be hard pressed to offer deltas but I absolutely will if someone provides an example of one person who has made a billion that deserves it.",champagne_papaya,687,945,0.7200000286102295,0.2944707107267708,1709171094,/r/changemyview/comments/1b2o53w/cmv_it_is_impossible_to_ethically_accumulate_and/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-29 01:44:54
1apxvv3,CMV: Abortion pills should be as accessible as a can of tuna at Walmart,"Abortion should be as accessible as a can of tuna because it's a fundamental aspect of reproductive healthcare. Easy access ensures timely interventions, reducing risks to women's health and well-being. Restricting access disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating inequalities. Accessibility respects bodily autonomy, empowering individuals to make informed choices about their lives. It promotes safer procedures, minimizing the need for dangerous alternatives. Ultimately, it upholds human rights by affirming individuals' control over their bodies and futures.

Men commit close to 80% of violent crimes. The issue is that it’s not 80% or men committing these crimes. It’s not like every male victim of a violent crime deserves it. It’s is extremely relevant that men are more likely to be victims of violent crimes than women. This narrative that men don’t have fear and never have to be cautious in life just doesn’t make any sense. & if someone says “well men are also victims of most of these crimes” saying “well men are committing them as well” just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.

1amad3o,"CMV: We can throw billions of dollars at public schools all we want, but until parents care more about their children’s academic performance nothing will change","We can’t spend our way out of it. We’ve tried. Look at the NYC public school system. We’ve shoveled dump trucks worth of money into their pockets and, while seeing some *marginal* improvements among some elements of the student body, have gotten nothing for it beyond more debt. America can’t wipe our asses for us, it’s not our mommy/daddy and we need to take responsibility for our lives and the lives of our children. And that means buckling down and making sure your kid is studying, doing their homework, **going to class** and in general giving two shits about their academic performance. No amount of money from the nanny state can fix that. Unfortunately, this problem is so deep and widely rooted I don’t know how the government *can* fix it.

In addition, the racial climate in America right now is just not conducive to discussions on a child’s poor performance. 69% of urban public schoolteachers in the United States are white. Using the New York state example, [https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/12/10/americas-public-school-teachers-are-far-less-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-than-their-students/ft_21-11-17_studentteacherrace_3/] (black and latino students are more then 40% more likely to have a white public-school teacher then one more congruent to their skin color (though how this takes into effect mixed race schoolteachers and mixed-race students I have no clue.). To be clear, I’d rather slam my hand in a door then get between *any* parent and their child. But it gets even harder when you’re a blonde, white woman telling a black parent/parents “hey x kid is a real shithead in class and doesn’t work hard, study, or in general attend.” without immediately losing the parents or at the very least, raising severely their hackles.

Parents are already extremely defensive about their children and then if you add the ugly history of race relations in America on top of it? Not a conducive environment for early interventions in troubled students lives. It’s the sad truth but you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. If the kid don’t care about reading, writing, or education in general you can’t force them to care. It has to come from the parent or guardian.

1b1i1rf,"CMV: The Palestine supporter who killed himself was a father, and for that reason I believe his act was selfish ","I am referring to the man who lit himself on fire while proclaiming “free palestine”. 
   
When I heard he left behind a child I really felt he acted selfishly.
   
I do believe a father can lay down his life for the greater good in a worthy circumstance. But the bar is very high. 
   
I dont believe his act will affect the status of Palestinian freedom. And I believe it would be reasonable for him to conclude this assuming he wasnt wrapped up in self righteousness or delusions of grandeur.
   
Another thing - the Israeli Palestine conflict was already mainstream global news. He hasnt shed any more light on an obscure story. Its already covered and saturated by awareness.
   
As for your children… Its one thing to leave behind loved ones - that hurts them and leaves them less than they were with you in their life.
   
Its another to leave behind children. You have a responsibility to your children to take care of them and provide them love and a knowledge of how to make it in the world.
   
There are ways you can improve the world without abandoning the most vulnerable kind of person possible that needs you - you directly. 
   
Ultimately the act becomes a shock symbol of how much he values his opinion on the conflict. We all get to stand back and admire how much conviction he had - how far he would go to make a statement about a current event - which will ultimately do nothing but rob his child of a parent.

1aszk01,CMV: Belief in religion is nothing more than believing in fairy tales or magic,"Any religion could absolutely be true, but there is 0 convincing evidence for any. There are vague philosophical arguments to be made for the existence of a soul or a creator/god in some form, but this CMV is specifically about following large religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and similar. I am more familiar with Christianity, although not fully and I plan to educate myself more, but I have very vague understandings of the others.

Currently I find myself extremely anti-religion and I want my view changed if possible to be more tolerant of those around me. I just do not understand how someone can follow a religion. Theres 0 evidence, all based on ""faith"" in a book written thousands of years ago and then rewritten and translated constantly over time. I dont see how believing in Christianity is any different to believing in magic. People I have talked to just sound brainwashed into believing it and it becoming a core part of themselves to the point where its too uncomfortable to change.

I do not see how in the modern day, belief in religion is logical. People will point to smart people believing in religion, but again, that just seems like brainwashing to me and is just trying to appeal to authority. I dont want arguments based in ""smart person did it so it must be true"", but rather why belief is logical. 

I find the argument of ""belief isnt logical, you just feel it"" or similar things also very weak. They just fall under ""ive been brainwashed and/or emotions make this belief comfortable so ill follow it"", rather than actual coherent thoughts and reasoning.

1aphyun,CMV: There shouldn't even be a debate on whether misandry is acceptable,"Browsing reddit has made more aware of how prevalent misandry is, both online and in real life. Looking back I'm noticing it's always been there but it's never been called out and was largely presented as acceptable. Numerous shows present misandry as a comedic thing even when the charater is harmed. In the show 'The King of Queens"", Carrie is extremely misandrist and abusive to Doug, who is scared of his wife, and it's played as a funny thing. I was watching paternity court and whenever a man says something like ""Women love to trap men with babies"" the judge (a woman) will go off on them but then in a different episode will make statements like ""men will tell you whatever in order to get you in bed"". 

I think one of the good things is that it's starting to be talked about a bit more but the fact that there's still a debate about it is insane to me. I can't think of any other form of bigotry that is not only present but also defended in common society.

Asking them to unilaterally stop the war is asking them to surrender and die, as Hamas continue to declare they'd continue killing Israelis as soon as they can. Their supporters in the west echo this sentiment (""no peace on stolen land"", ""from the river to the sea"", ""intifada"", ""we don't want no two states"").   
Even worse than that, urging them to accept Hamas' delusional demands (to release convicted murderers for example) is equivalent to urging Israel to not only surrender but also surrender on the terms dictated by the terrorist side who is miserably losing.

1aj04n2,"CMV: The USA's foreign policy is not to promote democracy, but to secure its own economic interest","A common thing that I keep hearing Americans say is that ""The USA is the great promoter of democracy"" or something along those lines. It usually assumes that democracy is more moral than authoritarianism (which I agree with to a certain extant), therefore the USA's foreign policy is broadly moral.

But that's just not true.

America allies with undemocratic states all the time, most notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia today, but also in the past. South Korea and Taiwan were dictatorships until 1987. Pakistan has shifted between democracy and military rule numerous times. The USA has often directly propped up dictators in other places as well like South Vietnam and Indonesia to secure their economic interests. Sometimes they even toppled governments that were elected democratically or were in favour of democracy, like in Iran and countless times in Latin America.

This pattern in foreign policy cannot be explained by the USA's willingness to protect democracy, but its willingness to secure its own economic interest. Egypt controls the Suez Canal and Saudi Arabia controls the oil. The USA must work with these authoritarian countries to ensure control over its own economic interests.

1arpifv,CMV: Leaving NATO would be one of the worst foreign policy decisions a President could make,"In case you haven't seen it, Reddit's favorite President, Donald John Trump, has been teasing the US stepping back from NATO, [telling his aids he's considering withdrawing America from the alliance](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html). It seems that MAGA conservatives and left-wing radicals alike are open to isolating the US from our NATO allies, which I think would be a generationally awful foreign policy blunder, ultimately resulting in bloody war in Europe. 

While this may have been a different discussion in early 2020, Putin has now made his imperial ambitions and willingness to wage war clear. His invasion of the sovereign state of Ukraine was an unprecedented violation of all the laws and norms of war Europe established after World War 2. Putin has made his ambition to recapture other former Soviet Republics clear, and it seems self-evident that the only thing stopping Putin from eventually invading NATO allies is his fear of triggering NATO's Article 5 and falling into a war with the United States.

While other NATO members have their own armies, they suck. [All other NATO allies combined have a smaller fighting force than Russia or the US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/584286/number-of-military-personnel-in-nato-countries/), and their technology and training are generally regarded as woefully inadequate. Turkey is the only other NATO ally with a decent army, but they're also the most unreliable in the alliance (along with Hungary). Without the guarantee of US mutual defense, I don't think that the threat of European NATO allies alone would be enough to deter further Russian expansion once they finish the war in Ukraine, and have the time to rebuild their army.

1ahyd7d,CMV: The sentence of Bryn Spejcher for stabbing her boyfriend to death was ridiculous.,"I'm refering to the California woman who stabbed her boyfriend 108 times after consuming cannabis and only sentenced last month to 100 days of community service.

This case reminds me of Sarah Halimi's one in France where an elderly lady got thrown off a window by a man who had just taken cannabis before his rampage and was considered not criminally responsible penally.

Although, contrarily to that other murder I do think that Bryn was indeed in a serious state of psychosis as she not only stabbed her boyfriend but her dog, and herself. And when the police intervened, even taser and baton strikes were not very effective at stopping her.

That being said I do believe that the sentence she received was highly problematic (way too low) for these 4 reasons:

* Even if marijuana frenzies can potentially happen on rare occasions, I just don't believe a mentally stable person could reach such violence with only marijuana. This led me to believe that she either consumed other additional substances or that she has some sort of mental instability that can lead her to become violent in some instances. And if that second hypothesis is true, then she needs psychiatric treatment (which was the decision for Sarah Halimi's murderer)
* Maybe the most important of my 4 points: Her not being aware during the killing doesn't mean she isn't responsible for it. The fact that she willingly decided to take psychotropic drugs that could potentially cloud her judgment meant she was responsible for putting herself in that state. Correct me if I'm wrong but if a person after consuming alcohol becomes violent a attacks others, he will be convicted. Removing all responsibility for marijuana sounds like encouragement for murderers to use this excuse and be cleared of charges.
* Receiving only 100 days of community service after brutally killing someone is shameful and a total disrespect for the deceased and his family. It just isn't right.
* Let's not fool ourselves, she only got this miraculous judgment because she was an upper-class white woman. If it was a man, poor or of color that sentencing would have been different.

And for these 4 reasons are believe that Bryn judgment was not only unfair but dangerous.",vuzz33,544,621,0.8299999833106995,0.2127170570982409,1706973492,/r/changemyview/comments/1ahyd7d/cmv_the_sentence_of_bryn_spejcher_for_stabbing/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-03 15:18:12
1avs3ma,CMV: All police officers in the United States should be required to get a Bachelor's in Criminal Justice,"Hello! Long time lurker on this subreddit.

I am a current Criminal Justice student and I interact with a lot of police content, both from the pro and anti side. I've seen enough horrible things to fully support police reform in this country, especially in rural departments that still operate like it's 1960.

The view that I hold is that 6-8 weeks of training is NOT enough for law enforcement officers, period. This is my second semester and we are barley scratching the surface. We spent an entire week on Search and Seizure case law and that was just the intro class, there is way more to learn in Constitutional Law and Legal Ethics.

The concepts we're just starting to get into this semester are very complicated and nuanced and require vast amounts of context to fully understand. I can't fathom how a police officer can learn enough at the academy when most of the training hours are spent on tactics and police operations.

Is eight weeks enough time to learn how tactics, firearms, and operations? Yes!

Is there enough time left over after all that to get even a baseline understanding of the law? NO

1az7dqj,"CMV: Trump'ism didn't manifest out of nowhere. The American people were conditioned, and ready to receive it.","I often hear talking heads trying to figure out the rise of Donald Trump, or try to explain his phenomenon. As if he simply arrived and corrupted everyone… a sweet innocent public.

My post is probably going to sound like a screed from the John Birch Society, but I have a lot of loose thoughts here.

There was a meanness and sickness to the culture at times, that we simply might have forgotten.

As someone who has followed politics, I can't stress how wild and nutty the Obama v. McCain election cycle was. Those McCain/Palin rallies were full of unhinged and crazy people. It's true that McCain was a relatively measured man, but the lines of people outside his rallies were pretty much the same MAGA people without the label yet. They were the eventual “tea party” people. I've never believed the myth that rank & file MAGA loyalists were non-political and simply got woke up in 2016.

It's the same usual suspects. They have just put their former campaign accouterments in storage.

There was a nastiness in popular culture for a while. 

All those daytime talk shows like Jerry Springer were common on all the networks. Go back and watch clips of these shows. Audience members take the microphone and call people on a panel, “BIG FAT SLUTTY PIGS!” to the roar of the crowd.

I was a massive Howard Stern radio show fan. An era where he would get disabled people to fight with the Klu Klux Klan, or openly use the “n-word” on terrestrial radio. Trump was a frequent guest.

There were just a lot of sleazy things that wouldn't be around today. A popular television commercial was for “Bum Fights,” a mail order VHS where someone got homeless people to attack each other.

Never mind Tucker going to Russia. Late '90s and early 2000s political media was horrendous. Anyone remember MSNBC's Michael Savage? He was telling people to get AIDS on TV.

This was the tone of the media. Bush v. Kerry was a wild and crazy election cycle, too. I remember Zell Miller challenging Chris Mathews to a duel on live television, or Ann Coulter calling Al Gore a ""f*g"" on TV, without much notice in pre-Twitter world.

Trump comes from celebrity popular culture. My first board game as a child was a Donald Trump one. He comes from this world.

He was a character. Comedy Central did a celebrity roast for him right before he became a candidate. They've never re-aired it, and simply pretend it never existed. Most of the jokes were about how he could grab any “pussy” he wanted because he was rich.

Trump was a long-planted seed that finally produced fruit. I've known that some populist crazy celebrity was going to eventually arrive. WWF wrestlers were becoming Governor in Minnesota.

I can't feign my poor virgin Puritan eyes and ears weren't ready for Trump, and it shocked me.

The American people were ready for it. Enough of them wanted it. We had been conditioned for it.",DougieSlug,708,265,0.8399999737739563,0.1895397482840185,1708813690,/r/changemyview/comments/1az7dqj/cmv_trumpism_didnt_manifest_out_of_nowhere_the/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-24 22:28:10
1akitl9,CMV: Replacement level fertility is impossible in liberal urbanized populations,"The reason none of the world's freest, most prosperous societies have a replacement level birthrate is that once you have removed archaic cultural hangups that penalize female childlessness, barriers to women's education and career advancement as well as minimize the prevalence of rural lifestyles, thereby eliminating the free labor force incentive to produce multiple children exclusively present in rural settings — there are no compelling reasons for the average woman to produce at least 2 children. 

Therefore, the birthrate per woman in an urbanized liberal society will always be below replacement. Case in point: not a single Nordic country has managed to get to replacement level fertility despite their heavily subsidized childcare as well as other welfare programs.

The ugly truth is that replacement level fertility in urbanized populations can only be the result of society-wide cultural and/or economic coercion, so, for example, European countries' only choices are replacement migration and regression to a pro-family culture that would by definition stigmatize childlessness.",KitezhGrad,269,830,0.6800000071525574,0.1892299169019423,1707249228,/r/changemyview/comments/1akitl9/cmv_replacement_level_fertility_is_impossible_in/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-06 19:53:48

1armn1r,Cmv: Kids are disrespectful toward the school system because it's disrespectful toward them.,"When I was in school I remember clearly, the overarching message coming from the teachers, staff, the entire school system in general was this: ""We don't care how you feel, we don't care what you think, you're here to do what we tell you to. If you don't do what we want, you're worthless to us."" 

Students who did poorly were often singled out and mentioned by name as examples of what not to be. Students who obviously came from neglectful homes were given no extra help or leniency, they were just treated as failures when they were clearly suffering and not allowed basic hygiene at home. How can you expect someone to get their work done when they don't even have a clean table at home? The students who were treated fairly were the ones who lived in the same subdivisions as the teachers, the ones who live in the neighborhood and who's parents hang out with the teachers as friends. 

There was a clear rift, if you could afford to live in the middle class subdivisions you were worth something and the teachers treated you like a person, if you couldn't afford to live there you were treated with disrespect. Poor kids were seen as a bad influence on the middle class subdivisioners, and so didn't deserve respect. They were always bad right from the start to the teachers. 

There were times I walked up to the teacher to ask for help, and they would stop and make me go away when one of their preferred students would come ask for help, or sometimes refuse to help at all. 

When I see teachers talk about problem students online they don't talk about the factors that cause them, and chock it up to ""lack of discipline."" (By discipline they mean that the poor kids will magically overcome all of their life problems by being beaten a little harder next time, as if they aren't already being beaten for everything they do or don't do.)",Ok_Lack_5705,405,647,0.6800000071525574,0.1880456324783348,1708022376,/r/changemyview/comments/1armn1r/cmv_kids_are_disrespectful_toward_the_school/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-15 18:39:36
1aktlq9,CMV: talking about politics early in a relationship (even on the first date) is healthy and shouldn't be frowned upon especially in the United states,"I was inspired to post this here after reading an article in late 2022 early 2023 after the Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion (the Dobbs decision) that overturned roe v wade. 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/29/relationships-post-roe/&ved=2ahUKEwif6JzHkZiEAxXsm4kEHQ-1AmQ4ChDF9AEoAHoECAsQAg&usg=AOvVaw1d0y_ODgBmhuXN63xJR_KK

It says that more and more couples are reevaluating their long term relationships with their partners or spouses over the controversial dobbs decision in June of 2022. Many hadn't had that conversation with their partners or considered their partners postions at all. In the article it states how many are asking new partners or dates how they feel about it early on to see if they would be on the same page or if they should end the relationship before it gets more serious.

Now that got me thinking. I believe that it's extremely healthy for dates and new couples to talk extensively about politics in the beginning of relationships. When you think of it politics controls alot of out lives whether its a supreme court decision like dobbs or roe or a local issue like the town council expanding a local park both those issues involve politics. So how does not talking about politics early in a relationship not benefit people really by seeing if a potential spouse and you have the same values in life. Even ben Shapiro agrees with this 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dr1cK1WoL2HE&ved=2ahUKEwi59cuplpiEAxU_jYkEHc4ZBzIQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2QWbRsuE0M6ksLhrHZza3O

Now many will say politics doesn't equal values and that you shouldn't limit yourself or not want to date people bases on their political opinions. A famous couple who are in a relationship like that are democratic strategist James Carville and his wife republican strategist Mary matalin make it work (despite her joining the libertarian party with the rise of trump). I argue relationships like that came to be in an Era when Americans weren't ""political"" in a sense but since 2016 America has become a very political nation like European counties. Which can be shown with this study from the United Kingdom 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dating-relationships-tory-politics-b2095705.html&ved=2ahUKEwjNkr78pZiEAxXsjIkEHXkgDkcQFnoECBQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0Q6gE6zFYeFPiTgHYYsdoN

So I think debating and learning someone's politics early in a relationship is a healthy thing to do. Why would I want to invest time and energy in a relationship with someone whom I don't share my values (this is especially true if your non religious) why would I want to buy a house with someone who doesn't think climate change is real and wants to buy a beach house because nothing will happen. Why would I want to date someone who treats a homeless person with disdain if I value empathy and especially with bodily autonomy why would a woman want to date a man who doesn't value her bodily autonomy and why should I who might value euthanasia and ""pulling the plug"" want to date someone who doesn't belive in that either. Americans have (albeit an increasingly less) interest or stomach for giving their political opinions in public especially in the dating world and I think that in order to not waste either parties time that should and need to change.",SnooPeripherals2455,511,510,0.8199999928474426,0.1880278191753601,1707277436,/r/changemyview/comments/1aktlq9/cmv_talking_about_politics_early_in_a/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-07 03:43:56
1b35xqj,CMV: Abortion should be legal and fine,"let me start off by saying that, yes, I'm pro-choice, but pro-life people seem to not understand half of what being pro-choice means and are mainly Christian (probably the reason why there's so many people who hate abortion or are pro-life), the reason I think abortion should be legal and available is because of many reasons, let's start off with the main ones. Let me, who the actual hell thinks it's alright for a rape victim to be forced to carry the child of someone who not only raped them, but traumatized them beyond comprehension, why should they have to carry the child of there rapist? Some may say, ""it's not the baby's fault!"" I'd argue that even if it's not the babies fault, the women shouldn't be forced to keep the child of her rapist, it's not only a constant reminder of what they went through but life three threating in some cases and it's also the fact that they didn't choose to have the child forced into them, why should they be forced to hold the child of there rapist, the person who ruined there life in many ways, why should the victim not only have to take the consequences of there rapists actions aka have a whole ass child from the very same person who traumatized them in multiple different ways, why should the victim be forced to go through the pain of labor and pregnancy pain for months on end and then go through hours of extreme pain just because of someone else's actions? Why should the victim have the change or make a life time long change that could ruin there life against there will and if they want to keep it, they can but I'm talking about those who were raped and don't want to ruin there life because of someone else. They shouldn't be forced to is what should be the answer of any sane human being.

second main reason; what about children (specifically teens or younger) who got raped, for them it could be even worse, a teens body isn't ready for that type of pain yet, it could also damage there internal organs and nor are teens financially, mentally, emotionally, nor physically ready for that responsibility, so why should a teen, be forced to potentially ruin her life in every way possible because of someone else's actions? Again, the answer for any sane and mentally well human being would be that the teen shouldn't have to unless they want to. This also goes for teens who weren't raped, there teens, hormones hit like a bitch, there not gonna be worrying about protection because when they have the chance to have sex with someone they like, there gonna take that chance, and teens also can't purchase condoms either which makes my point even stronger.

third main reason; What about incest? the whole reason why I say this is obvious, the child is the product of incest and would have a whole list of disorders and wouldn't live that long, the child would also, (if it lives) have a bad life in public and in school, people these days will sit there and shit on your for existing and point out all your insecurities and more, just to make you feel like shit, an incest baby would live one of the worst lives, not only having parents that are related and having a huge list of disorders and disabilities, but would be absolutely picked on and bullied or worse, people these days [do.Not.Care](https://do.Not.Care).

fourth main reason; what about women or men who poke holes in the condom? for females, that's basically rape and forcing the male to be forced to pay child support (because if you found out your partner did this, no way in hell any sane man would stay with her) and for a male, it's the same thing, it's basically rape and forced impregnation and she wouldn't know until it's to late, again, not her or his fault that there partner did this to them.

fifth main reason; what about the fact that it's her body, she's the one that's gonna have to be in pain while carrying and giving birth to the child, it's the women's body, not yours, your not the one carrying the child, she is, it should be her choice if she's ready for a child or not.",imadethistocomment15,132,969,0.6600000262260437,0.1831349651920054,1709227697,/r/changemyview/comments/1b35xqj/cmv_abortion_should_be_legal_and_fine/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-29 17:28:17

Here is the link if you haven't see it before. It's not necessary to watch it to respond though.


https://youtu.be/m4Z_fNDq_Pc?si=ryV4z7PPu35dbBdy


It's almost like Neil expected an ""obviously no I wouldn't"" and was surprise that that wasn't the answer.

Honestly it's a bit ridiculous that not only was he expecting the answer to be no but also was surprised by the possibility of the answer being yes.

Like yes Neil, some people don't like the idea of being dead. That's surprising to you?

If anything it should be the more expected position for the average person until they say otherwise.

Anyways, I'm full on board with Larry here. Rip to him he died a while ago btw. I, like him, can't stand the idea of not being alive.

But I want to adress Neil's argument more here.

He says that the absence of death means a lack of urgency and why would you even get out of bed because there's always tomorrow.

I believe this is a dumb argument. If I lived forever I would maybe stay for longer in bed. But that means because I have more time I can relax more which is not a bad thing at all.

I don't think Neil would say this is a bad thing which means it's more likely he meant you would have people stay in bed for... ever?

Like never get out of bed? Spend all day eating popcorn and watching TV?

Ummm no Neil, people would still want to improve their lives today rather than tomorrow.

But perhaps it would be this year rather than next.

Like sure it would he easier to put things off but that doesn't mean I still wouldn't want to get things done. 

Besides if I do more per day with a finite life, that doesn't mean a finite life is going to make you do more.

An infinite life you could still do more if you work only 10% as hard, which again I'm not suggesting people will do.

So why the hell is a finite life better?

Infacy with a finite life your appreciation of your accomplishments will come to an end when your life is over.

With an infinite you can appreciate your life achievements for longer and you'll have more to appreciate.

1auxy95,CMV: Land Acknowledgements Feel Forced and Ignorant,"Obviously it’s terrible what happened, but land acknowledgments seem so strange. It’s never even been an idea before the last few decades of human history. It’s also the fact that they won’t go on forever, at a certain point in history it becomes so thoroughly part of the conquerors it’s not even seen as having been part of the conquered.  
  
Like you don’t see Turkey holding land acknowledgments for Istanbul, or Russians saying they are on stolen Novgorodian land. It’s not like the Natives didn’t take from each other either. Maybe it’s because it’s Europeans that makes it different? It doesn’t really make too much sense to me.

At the end of the day, what do they really do anyways? Obviously no private land will ever be returned to those tribes and probably neither will government land. The only argument I see is to remember history, which I agree is important. It should be emphasized in school curriculum. At the same time, there are better ways to go about it than what essentially amounts to an apology for our forefathers, many of whom weren't in the country at the time and had no involvement with the government at the time.",LB333,456,410,0.8299999833106995,0.1605402914896845,1708375131,/r/changemyview/comments/1auxy95/cmv_land_acknowledgements_feel_forced_and_ignorant/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-19 20:38:51
1apbsy8,"CMV: Within 15 years, universal basic income will be a necessity as AI replaces the majority of jobs","We all know that AI usage has exploded in the last few years. While there is an undercurrent of fear regarding the eventual sentience of AI, the more practical and current concern is how AI will eventually change the job market.

Companies are now laying off employees and replacing them with AI, like [Google firing 30,000 employees](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-plans-layoff-30000-employees-fight-between-ai-humans-nath-esj8c/). While some have speculated that AI won't take over the majority of jobs, only improving workflow, I find this thought to be naive.

AI is not the printer press, the cotton gin, or the automobile. While those innovations did replace certain industries (the automobile made blacksmiths and ferriers unnecessary since everyone eventually stopped riding around in horse and buggy), they also created new industries that increased production within the overall job market.

This is not what AI does. AI does not simply make one or two industries obsolete; it has the potential to make the *majority* of human workers in most industries obsolete. It does not have the means to increase production beyond what it takes away from the job market.

This isn't simply, ""Oh you lost your job due to innovation? You should find new skills."" Because beyond labor workers (construction, trade skills, military, etc.), *all* skills can eventually be done by AI and done better.

And people are skeptical saying, ""Well, it can't write code write now."" or ""The blogs it writes are terrible."" While that may be so, the exponential growth means that AI will eventually be good enough to replace the majority of white collar and creative jobs.

It's not simply a new innovation. It will eventually be (and I presume very quickly) an entire restructuring of work. Why should companies pay actual humans that are falable when they hire however many workers to run the AI and produce whatever the organization needs for exponentially cheaper?

Eventually, and I'm guessing within 15 years, AI will reshape the job market to the point where universal basic income will become a necessity for people to simply get money and survive.

I'm hopeful that someone can change my view on this because I certainly don't want this to happen. I would like the majority of people to keep their jobs, but I currently don't see a future where one of three things happen:

1. UBI is mandated.
2. Laws are passed that require companies to have X% of human workers.
3. A combination of the two.",MiltonRoad17,336,533,0.7400000095367432,0.1554022544035886,1707773885,/r/changemyview/comments/1apbsy8/cmv_within_15_years_universal_basic_income_will/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-12 21:38:05
1b0tbbq,CMV: I am not convinced that a one-state solution is the best solution for the Israel-Palestine situation,"Let me make it very clear from the start that I am not trying to have a debate here on the legality/morality of Israel's actions in Gaza right now.

I've been seeing a rise in popularity in the ""one state solution"" to this conflict, particularly among progressives and especially among progressive commentators.

The one state solution from what I am understanding would mean:

\- (In theory) Free and democratic elections

\- Equal rights for all, regardless of ethnicity, religion, or any other identifying characteristic

Whether it's called ""Israel"" or ""Palestine"" or something else doesn't really matter.

I don't really have an issue with this premise. It will solve the issues around territorial disputes and settlements, two issues that have been sticking points in two-state negotiations for a long time. It also resolves the Palestinian right to return issue, which is another major hurdle in negotiations. Both parties will also have free access to important religious sites.

I think practically this won't work though, and here's why I think that (let's assume both parties' representatives agree to the one state):

\- Both Israelis and Palestinians have been scarred by this conflict and I don't see a world where Israelis in particular feel safe/OK sharing a country with people they perceive to be hostile to them

\- I am almost 100% certain in this new state there will be systemic racism towards Arabs/Muslims

\- I'm pretty confident that, while Hamas/other militant groups will lose a lot of support with the advent of freedom/democracy for all, separatist groups will still persist and commit acts of terrorism (like we saw with Spain and Ireland)

\- I fear the implications of acts of terrorism persisting in this single nation. With the case of the Basque in Spain, for example, while democracy and autonomy really plummeted support for the ETA (the Basque separatist/terrorist group), attacks persisted by a faction who were dead set on having the Basque Country be an independent sovereign state, or ""free from Spain"". While Spain, after the death of Franco, ceased collectively punishing the Basque for their terrorism I am not confident that this single state (which, let's be honest, is likely going to see Jews hold the majority of the power in government) is going to take kindly with the likely scenario that acts of terrorism will persist by separatist groups

Since the whole ""one state solution"" seems to be quite popular with progressives, and since I agree with the premise, I'd love to be convinced that this is a favorable solution to the two-state, but I personally just don't see it as a practical/realistic solution.",_Richter_Belmont_,138,780,0.7099999785423279,0.1540042103442851,1708982827,/r/changemyview/comments/1b0tbbq/cmv_i_am_not_convinced_that_a_onestate_solution/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-26 21:27:07

He was however generally competent, not corrupt, and mostly successful. The Affordable Care Act in particular was a major improvement to the US health insurance landscape and probably the most significant positive reform to American healthcare in decades.

It will most likely be said that we shouldn’t allow presidents to serve more than two terms but frankly I don’t see why. It’s an artificial barrier that prevents the best qualified and most popular candidate from running. The one time we had a president serve more than twice was FDR, and he’s gone down as one of our greatest presidents.

1atg59o,CMV: A requirement to be associated with a “well regulated militia” would be a great start to curbing gun violence.,"IMO guns are awesome. Some of the best days of my life have started with a trip to the dollar store to get a bunch of nicknacks, putting those nicknacks on a berm and making said nicknacks into many smaller nicknacks through the liberal (no pun intended) application of freedom pellets. 

However, I would give that up tomorrow if I never had to read about a school shooting ever again.

I get that “a well regulated militia” meant something else when the bill of rights was written and that the Supreme Court already ruled that the right to bare arms is an individual right. However, this isn’t the 18th century anymore and our founders gave us the opportunity to amend the constitution. Why can’t we make state militias a thing and require gun owners to join the militia with requirements to train on gun use and safety? Gun ownership is a responsibility. I can think of several people I know who don’t practice the absolute basics of gun safety, but use their firearms regularly.

At the very least, this would allow a regular check in with gun owners and an opportunity for people to raise red flags if someone seems “off” or doesn’t practice good safety practices.

We can’t agree to anything related to the second amendment but we can all agree that gun violence sucks. Would it really be such a bad thing to have a practice that ensured that everyone that owned a gun knew how to use it properly and safely?",ChuckyShadowCow,162,726,0.6000000238418579,0.1503066490054773,1708214008,/r/changemyview/comments/1atg59o/cmv_a_requirement_to_be_associated_with_a_well/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-17 23:53:28
1ajlwj2,CMV: Parents have no right to hit their child. Spanking a child is a form of physical abuse that requires intervention and counseling by CPS or other authorities.,"  
It is commonly agreed that denying a child food or medical care constitutes child abuse, because of the adverse impacts on the child's health, physical and emotional development, and wellbeing. We have reached this conclusion based on numerous long term research studies that have demonstrated the adverse impacts of these practices. Drinking while pregnant with your child is similarly considered a form of child abuse, because of its negative effects on child development.  


However, despite decades of scientific research and an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that spanking or corporal punishment in children creates a host of adverse effects on the child, we still accept that parents have the right to punish their children in this manner.   


**What does the research say?**  


* A landmark meta-analysis published in 2002 showed that **of** **27 studies on physical punishment and child aggression,** **all found a significant positive relation,** regardless of the size of the sample, location of study, ages of the children or any other variable. (Gershoff ET. Corporal punishment by parents and associated child behaviors and experiences: a meta-analytic and theoretical review. Psychol Bull 2002;128:539–79)  

* Physical punishment is **associated with a range of mental health problems in children, youth and adults, including depression, unhappiness, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness, use of drugs and alcohol,** and general psychological maladjustment. (Turner HA, Muller PA. Long-term effects of child corporal punishment on depressive symptoms in young adults: potential moderators and mediators. J Fam Issues 2004;25:761–82)  

* Intriguing results are now emerging from neuroimaging studies, which suggest that **physical punishment may reduce the volume of the brain’s grey matter** in areas associated with performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III). (Tomoda A, Suzuki H, Rabi K, et al. Reduced prefrontal cortical gray matter volume in young adults exposed to harsh corporal punishment. Neuroimage 2009;47:T66–71)  

* Physical punishment can cause **alterations in the dopaminergic regions associated with vulnerability to the abuse of drugs and alcohol.** (Sheu Y-S, Polcan A, Anderson CM, et al. Harsh corporal punishment is associated with increased T2 relaxation time in dopamine-rich regions. Neuroimage 2010;53:412–9)

&#x200B;

* Researchers are also finding that **physical punishment is linked to slower cognitive development and adversely affects academic achievement.** (Straus MA, Paschall MJ. Corporal punishment by mothers and development of children’s cognitive ability: a longitudinal study of two nationally representative age cohorts. J Aggress Maltreat Trauma 2000;18:459–83)

  
Similarly, research has demonstrated that there is a high correlation between spanking and serious physical abuse.  The Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS 1998) showed that 75% of substantiated physical abuse of children occurred during episodes of physical punishment.  Another large Canadian study found that children who were spanked by their parents were seven times more likely to be severely assaulted by their parents (e.g., punched or kicked) than children who were not spanked. In an American study, infants in their first year of life who had been spanked by their parents in the previous month were 2.3 times more likely to suffer an injury requiring medical attention than infants who had not been spanked. (Crandall M, Chiu B, Sheehan K. Injury in the first year of life: risk factors and solutions for high-risk families. J Surg Res 2006; 133:7–10) This indicates to me that allowing corporal punishment opens the door for other forms of more severe physical violence.   
**To me it's simple: parents have no right to permanently damage their child's brain, whether that's drinking while pregnant or hitting it after it's born. Any action which permanently harms a child's brain development is a form of child abuse that requires intervention.** ",Plastic-Abroc67a8282,46,817,0.5299999713897705,0.140855791104797,1707153653,/r/changemyview/comments/1ajlwj2/cmv_parents_have_no_right_to_hit_their_child/,2024,2,changemyview,2024-02-05 17:20:53

Donald Trump has made sexual comments about her daughter over the years.

1biwpvb,"CMV: Progressives often sound like conservatives when it comes to ""incels""—characterizing the whole group by its extremists, insisting on a ""bootstrap mentality"" of self-improvement, framing issues in terms of ""entitlement,"" and generally refusing to consider larger systemic forces.","Married guy here. Happy relationship, sexually satisfied, father to a compassionate son, and I find fulfillment in my career.

I don't have a personal stake in the ""Incel Debates,"" but I do know a few loved ones who fit the term and I do spend way too much on the internet readings posts and articles discussing the topic.

Now, nothing in this post is intended to deny the reality that some incels are absolutely shitty people. I would say that I know four younger men who fall into this category and one of them (my youngest brother, actually) is someone I am deeply concerned for as he is now genuinely consumed with bitterness towards the world and women. However, the other three are genuinely great guys. They aren't 9s or 10s pulling down $200k while flexing their six-packs, but they're solid. **I'll put it this way:** I met my wife, dated, and got married in the late 2000s—before the rise of dating apps and the death of Third Spaces. ***If any of these three guys had been single during those years, they would have easily been able to strike up relationships.*** 

And yet I've seen these guys 1) get unfairly tagged with the ""incel"" label and its stigma and 2) listened to their sincere emotional pain over having very few outlets for discussing the loneliness and relational hardships they face. That's really what has prompted this post.

* ""Incels should focus on improving themselves instead of complaining all the time—then they'd get dates."" This sounds like my conservative town talking about poor people. Is ""picking yourself up by the bootstraps"" ever the solution to something that is affecting millions of people?
* ""Incels feel like they are *entitled* to sex. No one is entitled to *my* body!""

1bbox25,CMV: HAMAS is at fault for the tragedy in Gaza,"I'm not super educated in geopolitics and history. I think it should be easy to CMV. I just need to understand better because from the research I did it seemed pretty clear cut and obvious.

Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. They provided some social services and now the care of the people who live there is under Hamas. Their safety and well-being is now in HAMAS's hands.

How did they take care of their people? Well by shooting missiles at a superior military for two decades. Then when they finally hit Israel a little too hard, and Israel dropped warnings to evacuate, HAMAS told their people it's a bluff and to ignore it... This seems super obvious that HAMAS has been doing this the whole time so that a big enough tragedy happens that they get attention and resources because of the tragedy. Public opinion shift was the goal. 

I understand that whole area has a very complicated history. I mean since ancient Mesopotamia crazy events have been taking place in that part of the world. I'm sure if you ask either party who started it, their answers will go back indefinitely since the dawn of civilization.

Is it not rational to assign responsibility during the leadership shift in 2007? I mean if aliens invaded with superior technology, and warned us not to attack, and one of our leaders commanded us to attack... And we get wiped out... That's poor leadership no?

I believe that racism, on its own is described as any judgement of a person solely based on their skin color, ancestry, race, etc. This does exclude white people.

I understand that racism for many people is systemic. I am aware of redlining, residential schools, generational trauma, racist school funding practices, and so forth.

I believe that racism and systemic racism are not synonymous but rather that systemic racism is a further defined type of racism. It just happens to be much more prevailent than plain racism. 

I also want to be clear that though there are people arguing that white people are victims of racism en masse, that is not what I'm talking about.

The cost of the 13 inch Macbook Air is already inflated at 1100 USD for a machine with 8 GB  RAM and a measle 256 GB of storage, and the second you start upgrading the specs Apple dials the bullshit up to 11. increasing system RAM by 8GB is 200 dollars and going from 256GB SSD to 1TB is a whopping 400 dollars.

This is not what a centrist is. 

While a centrist may indeed be more likely to admit that they don’t have enough information on a topic to form an opinion (that’s an incredibly wise thing to do, by the way, much better than just picking a side and not knowing what you’re talking about), that’s not what centrism is.

Centrism is having political positions on different topics which could be either considered liberal or conservative, putting their median position in the middle. For example, if you ask a centrist about abortion, gun control, higher taxes, and about universal healthcare, they might be pro-life, anti-gun control, pro-universal healthcare, and think we ought to raise taxes, that would make them, on average, in the middle. Centrists aren’t centrist on issues, they’re centrists on average.

I think most people understand this but pretend not to. It is perfectly fine to dislike centrism on that merit, but it seems that most people tend to distort what centrism is, turning it into a strawman. As seen in a popular comic which I am sure you have seen, a centrist is inbetween the KKK and members of the civil rights movement holding a sign that says “compromise?”

People on the left have used this comic to say “the kkk is the right wing and the civil rights movement is the left wing, and so they’re letting it happen!” Which is multiple straw men in one argument. The fact that this is such a repeated argument shows that they don’t hate moderates because they are moderates, they hate them because they’re not leftists. Same thing goes for the right wing.

There could be two people who have opposite viewpoints on everything, and still both be moderate. It’s not an ideology, it’s a category.",OkieFemboy,748,842,1.0,0.3361369341955116,1710876288,/r/changemyview/comments/1bissk6/cmv_most_people_who_dislike_centristsmoderates/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-19 19:24:48
1bgrusp,"CMV: As a left-winger, we were wrong to oppose nuclear power","This post is inspired by this news article: [CSIRO chief warns against ‘disparaging science’ after Peter Dutton criticises nuclear energy costings](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/15/csiro-peter-dutton-gencost-report-nuclear-energy-renewables-cost)

When I was in year 6, for our civics class, we had to write essays where we picked a political issue and elaborate on our stance on it. I picked an anti-nuclear stance.

But that was 17 years ago, and a lot of things have changed since then, for the worse:

* [Australia became the first country to vote in a government to remove a carbon tax](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/17/australia-kills-off-carbon-tax) \- illustrating that progress on climate action can be reversed
* [Germany is expanding coal mining](https://euobserver.com/green-economy/157364) because of a shortage of Russian gas - illustrating that many countries are not yet ready to completely switch to renewables
* The recent wave of climate protests in Australia [only backfired because it led to us losing our right to protest](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/05/30/australias-crackdown-climate-activists)

There are many arguments to be made against nuclear power. A poorly-run nuclear power plant can be a major safety hazard to a wide area. Nuclear can also be blamed for being a distraction against the adoption of renewable energy. Nuclear can also be criticised for further enriching and boosting the power of mining bosses. Depending on nuclear for too long would result in us exhausting our Uranium reserves. 

But unfortunately, to expect a faster switch to renewables is just wishful thinking. This is the real world, a nasty place of political manoeuvring, compromises and climate change denial. Ideally, we'd switch to renewables faster (especially here in Australia where we have a vast surplus of renewable energy potential), but there are a lot of people (such as right-wing party leader Peter Dutton) standing against that. However, they're willing to make a compromise made where nuclear will be our ticket to lowering carbon emissions. What point is there in blocking a ""good option"" (nuclear) in favour for a ""best option"" (renewables) that we've consistently failed to implement on a meaningful scale? 

Even if you still oppose nuclear power after all this, nuclear at worst is a desperate measure, and [we are living in desperate times](https://theconversation.com/climate-tipping-points-are-nearer-than-you-think-our-new-report-warns-of-catastrophic-risk-219243).

1bivpa0,CMV: There's nothing wrong with schools teaching kids about gay people,"There is a lot of controversy nowadays about schools teaching about homosexuality and having gay books in schools, etc. Personally, I don't have an issue with it. Obviously, I don't mean straight up teaching them about gay sex. But I mean teaching them that gay people exist and that some people have two moms or two dads, etc.

Some would argue that it should be kept out of schools, but I don't see any problem with it as long as it is kept age appropriate. It might help combat bullying against gay students by teaching acceptance. My brother is a teacher, and I asked him for his opinion on this. He said that a big part of his job is supporting students, and part of that is supporting his students' identities. (Like, he would be there for them if they came out as gay.)

1bdtc23,Cmv: I don't believe a friend cheating on their partner means I should cut the friend off,"I saw a post this morning on AITA regarding someone asking their partner not to allow their groomsman to bring their affair partner to the wedding. I totally agree with that because the woman who was cheated on was in the wedding party as well.
The part I don't agree with is the many comments stating that the soon to be husband should reconsider his friendship with his friend because he cheated.
In my opinion being a bad partner does not automatically equate to being a bad friend, father, sibling etc. Cheating is horrible and I am not trying to excuse it but I couldn't rationalize cutting off a friend for it, unless they roped me into it or had me cover for them unknowingly.
Edit: So far in this thread cheating has been compared to murder, kicking a dog, domestic/child abuse, and rape. Basically if your not ostracizing a cheater you might as sell support all of that as well. Also your partner will probably end up cheating on you. I just feel like thats a wild stretch from saying I don't agree with cutting off a friend for their martial/ relationship issues..",yellowabcd,651,893,1.0,0.323012910299152,1710341387,/r/changemyview/comments/1bdtc23/cmv_i_dont_believe_a_friend_cheating_on_their/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-13 14:49:47
1bk2irj,CMV: Netanyahu Never wanted Peace,"\>!DISCLAIMER: This post is only a conversation with the decent people left within our society who just want peace.!<

  
So the Prime minster of israel, and the rest of his extremist cabinet, just want the war to rage on, as long as they get their paychecks, and as long as the people they dislike are dying. Doesn't matter if it's at the cost of kids, elderly, pregnant women, hostages.. They just pretend to have a mission.  
So let's talk about the supposed mission of ""Eliminating Hamas""  
The israeli gov will claim they are only targeting Hamas..  
But, for years, Netanyahu was reported to be helping fund Hamas (as per [TimesOfIsrael](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) & [NyTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-money-prop-up-hamas.html)), and in 2019, He himself said and i [quote](https://twitter.com/haaretzcom/status/1711329340804186619?lang=en); ""Whoever wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support the strengthening and financing of Hamas.""  
On top of that, The current finance minister of israel, said in 2015 and i [quote](https://twitter.com/rulajebreal/status/1720923597873549554) ""Hamas at this point, in my opinion, is an asset.""  
So how can you eliminate your asset?  
Here's the government strategy;  
Keep Hamas in power. Offer anything except a sovereign Palestinian state ""for security reasons"", and disrupt any real effort for Peace ([Osslo accords](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine)). Ignore the illegal settlements ([condemned by the UN](https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15424.doc.htm)), and the killing of Palestinians in the israeli controlled West bank.  
Make life unbearable for Palestinians, Facilitate unemployment [conditions](https://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/20190606_forced_unemployment), cut the water sources ([documented](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/)), introduce bills to control the [courts](https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-supreme-court-overturns-a-key-component-of-netanyahu-s-polarizing-judicial-overhaul-/7420408.html), destroying the biggest buildings in Gaza to displace civilians, killing and arresting civilians who protest or show any contempt of past actions, Hamas attacks you, literally do whatever you want (Defending yourself).  
5 months after Oct the 7th, Gaza flattened, at least 30k civilians dead (most are women and children as reported by the pentagon), israel killed more hostages than released, Hamas still around.  
The goal was clear, even before Oct the 7th, they never wanted Peace, or a Palestinian state.  
2023 was reported to be the deadliest year in the history of the West bank. It got to the point where Biden himself had put a ban on individuals committing atrocities there, and that's not mentioning the uncontrolled army killings, because they see no consequences, they act as if the Palestinian lives do not matter.  
As cited in South Africa's [case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOW_1exsHE8), the army led by Netanyahu believe everyone in Gaza is complicit, as Netanyahu cited the biblical term ""Amalek"" at the beginning of the offensive on Gaza, he said ""Remember what the Amalek has done to you.""  
The biblical scripture regarding Amalekites reads ""I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'  
The IDF soldiers later filmed themselves shouting ""There are no innocent civilians"". They also have filmed themselves celebrating destruction, burning aid, looting homes, posing in women's underwear, mocking traumatized people, the list goes on..  
Currently, famine is looming on many in Gaza, as reports confirm israel have been blocking aid to the entire north, for three month, till two days ago, when they got pressured into letting 13 trucks in, which is way short of what is needed (500 trucks per day as estimated by UN).

  
Earlier this week, The US Senator Chris Van Hollen admits after crafting the national security memorandum, and after the reports, that israel is not in compliance with international law, they are blocking aid such as maternity kits, water purifiers, from entering the Gaza strip, sending back a lot of the of trucks, not to mention letting civilians block aid entrances..  
He also stated that, “There is no doubt that the claims that Netanyahu made that UNRWA is a tool of Hamas are ""flat-out lies,"","" The person who runs operations on the ground in Gaza is a 20 year U.S. Army veteran”, he added.

  
Earlier, The israeli gov claimed 12 UNRWA (Aid agency) members were affiliated with Hamas, without providing evidence, and the US cut aid to UNRWA, so did the EU, amidst famine. Now amidst investigations, there is no evidence of such affiliation, even UNRWA stated that personal were tortured to admit such links. The EU have restored funding, and the US is still pending..  
It has become evident that the Netanyahu's government, and those with extremist ideology (Zionism), never wanted peace in the middle east (as stated in the Likud party charter) they want all the land from Jordan to the sea, and they will abuse the power given to them without oversight  
As history shows, if we really want to achieve peace, we must deliver justice, prosecute criminals, and figure out democratic solutions, without malicious intent from fascist governments.

&#x200B;

And before you go,   
Here are my 3 main questions/concerns to be answered thoroughly for you to change my mind;

&#x200B;

1-  Why would the israeli army [bulldoze](https://twitter.com/i/status/1748013404663537974) trees in the middle of the roads, render all water treatment plants nonfunctional or [destroyed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/middleeast/gaza-water-plant-photos.html), blocking aid trucks from entering maternity kits & water purifiers?

  
2- According to all humanitarian fronts ([UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147656), [IRC](https://www.rescue.org/press-release/famine-imminent-northern-gaza-children-are-being-starved-israels-blockade-and), [ICP](https://www.care-international.org/news/ipc-report-half-gaza-experiencing-catastrophic-hunger-famine-imminent-northern-governorates) and more), 1 million civilians in Gaza right now are facing stage 5 of famine (the highest), why would the israeli gov still blockade the aid when they can control how it is distributed and got the armed forces to secure that?

&#x200B;

3- Some people are yelling ""release the hostages"" on posts of dying kids (as if these kids got them), do you think it's acceptable for the isreali gov to starve kids/innocent civilians to death if Hamas can sort themselves out and not surrender?",HourDrive1510,673,830,1.0,0.3162076387801221,1711013344,/r/changemyview/comments/1bk2irj/cmv_netanyahu_never_wanted_peace/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-21 09:29:04
1bde6ww,CMV: It's not unreasonable to be sad or even depressed over a lack of sex.,"So hear me out, human's at the end of the day are animals with a drive to get that special serotonin boost that comes from sex. When someone is unable to get sex, they are doing something that goes against every evolutionary imperative we have. 

Aside from that being able to create and maintain relationships with other human's is a normal social skill that if you are lacking it makes you abnormal. No matter how you slice, it, it is not normal to be unable to form relationships. If this applies to friendships, it should make sense that it apply to romantic relationships as well. 

Romantic relationships are considered a normal part of social development that starts at youth. There's a reason why if someone is a 40 year old man who's never dated or had sex (exculding celibate or asexual people) they will get weird looks. Relationships, and by an extension sex is something that most humans expect to have at some point in their life, and it's a decently reasonable expectation. When you are say 20 and all your friends have dated and had sex, it can be distressing as you see the people around you progressing in a way you are failing to.

You begin to question what is wrong with you and why women don't like you in that way. I know some people say ""if you can't get laid it's 100% your fault 100% of the time"" but some people are just genuinely unlucky. If you believe it's possible for bad things to happen to good people, it's not consistent that someone unable to date is 100% at personal fault. 

Anyways, like I said earlier, you question why and what's wrong with you. Your self esteem takes a hit because it's literally a judgement of you and your attractiveness. It also get's worse as years go on. I'm a 23 year old virgin, I felt a lot less distressed about my inability to attract a woman at 18 than I do now. It's like interest, but sadness. 

I think it's only logical that this can lead someone through pretty rough paths emotionally. ",Tall_Promotion_7160,879,568,1.0,0.3148493947598058,1710291458,/r/changemyview/comments/1bde6ww/cmv_its_not_unreasonable_to_be_sad_or_even/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-13 00:57:38
1b71lz0,CMV: You should be able to have weapons for self defence in the UK,"In the UK, we are not allowed to have weapons (lethal or non-lethal) at all for self defence purposes. So if you keep a baseball bat under your bed to use in the event of a break-in into your property, you're in trouble. Same thing with keeping pepper spray in your car, or whatever.

The only way around it is to suggest that the weapon's main use is something other than self defence. For the bat, it'd be that you bought it to play baseball at the park. Would be wise to keep a mit or a ball next to it to make that more believable to the police. For the pepper spray, not sure you can get out of that one. Regardless, I think this is ridiculous

I see absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be able to preemptively plan for bad situations. If someone breaks in, you don't know what they're armed with, how many accomplices they're with, etc. Using lethal weapons I believe can be argued, but using non-lethal weapons should be a no-brainer.

When seconds count, police are minutes away. You should be able to protect yourself before they get there. Criminals don't wait

1b8gfs0,"CMV: Anyone who says ""Israel should never have been established"" has no good argument for what should have happened INSTEAD of Israel being established","I just want to clarify before I start: I am not in any way arguing that the creation of Israel was completely moral, or that people weren't unwillingly displaced, or that there weren't bad faith actors in the Zionist movement. What I am specifically trying to argue is that I truly don't think there was any better *alternative* to establishing Israel as a state (also, I'm specifically talking about the UN resolution that led to this happening, not necessarily the actions taken between the resolution and Israel actually gaining independence--which did involve a lot of back-and-forth killing, displacement, and taking more land than was initially intended). I am pretty confident that anyone who argues that Israel being created as a state was a mistake or that Israel should be dismantled because it should have ""never been created in the first place"" has not actually considered what should have happened instead, or is possibly unaware of some historical facts that led to the necessity of Israel being established.

I'm going to present several arguments (in bold) that someone may make when arguing why Israel shouldn't have been established. My responses to each of these arguments are not serving to discredit the legitimacy of the arguments, but rather show that there wasn't really anything *better* that could have happened in each of these scenarios, unless we want to completely ignore historical context at the time.  
Let's start by talking about the UN resolution 181 that led to splitting Mandatory Palestine into two states--one Jewish, one Arab. The Jews accepted this plan, the Arabs did not.

   
**""But why did the Arabs have to accept? It's their land! They shouldn't have to partition it!""**

For one, it wasn't just ""their land"". Again, it was ""British Mandate of Palestine"". The land was owned by the British, won from the Ottomans after WW1, and there were several Jews living there at the time as well--some who had lived there for years and whose families had never been kicked out of the land, some whom had escaped pogroms in Eastern Europe starting in the 1800's and had legally purchased land from Ottoman landlords, and a large number of refugees escaping from violence both in Europe and in other Middle Eastern countries (more on this in a few points). Now, does Palestine not being a country mean that the opinions of the Arabs living there shouldn't have mattered? Of course not. They had been living there for thousands of years as well. But it isn't true that it was ONLY their land. 

Now, there can definitely be arguments that the *way* the land was partitioned was unfair, or that there were unfair components of the partition, but what would have been the right thing to do in that case? Offer a counter-proposal or counter-solution. Instead, they immediately went to war with Israel months before the partition plan was put into effect.   
Now, if you accept that both Jews and Arabs were living on the land at the time, your argument might be **""They should have just created a binational/unified state where they could all live in harmony like they did before! Jews and Arabs lived together peacefully before Zionism!""**  
First of all, they definitely did not live peacefully together, and this is severe historical revisionism. Of course there were good relationships between Jews and Muslims, it wasn't all hatred. But for the most part, there was a ton of violence and fighting between the two groups. Second of all--many people don't know this, but a binational state was considered and proposed. There are several reasons why that didn't work. This is just one source, so take it with a grain of salt, but here is more info on this that's compressed into a fairly easy-to-follow post: [https://www.instagram.com/p/C2PO89vtUVi/?hl=en&img\_index=1](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2PO89vtUVi/?hl=en&img_index=1) (there are sources for this information in the caption of the post).   
So, long story short: At the time of partition, there were several Jews and Arabs living there, both of whom had the right to live on that land. A binational state wasn't feasible, so there was no option but to partition. To this you might say:  
**""Okay, so there were several Jews there. But why did Palestine have to be responsible for all of them? It's Palestine's land! It's terrible that Jews were kicked out of all those countries, but why did Palestinians have to deal with it?""**  
I mean, here's the thing: The Jews who escaped to Palestine did so because there was a growing Jewish presence there and one of the only places they thought they would be safe. In fact, the British essentially pushed them into Palestine because the UK refused to take in Jewish refugees to help them escape from the Holocaust....while letting them escape to Palestine, despite the fact that they knew the Arabs wouldn't necessarily be happy with this. But ultimately, the reason they escaped was because of violence in the countries they came from, so they were essentially refugees. Are you anti-refugee? Or anti-immigration? Because I don't think anyone trying to argue that ""The Jews shouldn't have immigrated to Palestine and just expected the Arabs to take them all as refugees!"" would have any problem whatsoever with America or other Western countries taking in refugees. In fact, I think that anyone who did had a problem with Arab refugees escaping to Europe, or Latin Americans immigrating to America, would be seen as very racist and ""anti-progressive"". Is it only ""progressive"" to take refugees in when it's Western countries taking them in? Do refugees have to be ""non-white"" for their status as refugees to be taken seriously? (We could also go on for hours here about how the majority of Jews in Israel now come from the Middle East and *aren't* white, or that Ashkenazi Jews in Europe were literally persecuted for not being white enough, but I think you get my drift here--a lot of people view Jews as being ""whiter"" than the rest of the Middle East, therefore have the tendency to view Israelis as ""white colonizers"")  
Now to this you might say: **""But it wasn't just immigration! a lot of the Jews who came to Palestine weren't just there as refugees, they were there as part of the 'Zionist project'! They were intentionally lured there to displace Arabs and create a Jewish state!""**  
Sure, there were many Jews who immigrated to Palestine under the ""Zionist project"", and I've already acknowledged that there were some Zionist leaders who acted in very bad faith. But, there were hundreds of thousands of Jews immigrating there--there is no way that all of them were escaping to Palestine specifically in order to be ""part of the Zionist project"" and help create a Jewish state. Many of them simply needed a safe space to go, and Palestine was one of the only options. When immigrating to Palestine, I can bet you a good majority of them weren't thinking ""Oh yay! Now that I'm escaping persecution and moving to Palestine, I can't wait to be part of this movement that helps turn Palestine into a Jewish state!"" No, they were mostly just concerned with escaping for their lives, and probably couldn't give a sh\*t in the moment about whether or not a Jewish state would eventually be created. And even if they did go there as part of some ""project""--does that mean that because of their so-called ""intentions"", they should be forced to leave? What were they going to do in the 1940's? Were they going to invent some lie-detecting technology to brain-scan every Jew who arrived, to determine whether or not they were there with the intention of ""displacing Palestinians""? Would this any better than America refusing Mexican immigrants because they're worried that the immigrants are trying to ""take all their jobs"", or refusing Muslim refugees because they're worried that they're going to try to ""impose Muslim law on us""? Regardless of why they came there in the first place, once they were there, were they going to *send those Jews back to the countries that they themselves were displaced from, or where they were violently abused and watched their family members get killed?* Were they supposed to just leave and go back to those countries? Because that seems pretty anti-progressive to me.....

Okay, now let's go into some arguments that aren't necessarily related to the creation of Israel, but people may follow up with afterward that bring us back to the original point.  
After reading all of my arguments above, you might say, ""**Okay, but no state technically has a right to exist! A state just shouldn't have been created at all!""**  
Okay then, why am I not seeing you spending even a fraction of your time advocating for other countries to be dismantled? If you're spending this much time arguing that Israel shouldn't have been established because ""no state has the right to exist,"" I better see you arguing the same energy for all countries--especially other countries that are built on ""stolen land,"" as you say. (Reminder that Jews are also native to the region! Doesn't mean Palestinians aren't, but Jews are too!)  
Now in response to this, you might say **""The reason I'm not putting energy into dismantling other states is because they aren't committing atrocities the way Israel is! They've been killing and displacing Palestinians for decades now, and forcing them to live under apartheid!""**  
Israel has done some pretty atrocious sh\*t, I'm not going to deny that. There are several things that I seriously think they could have dealt with better. But, if you look at some of the things that have happened, there is almost *always* some type of explanation as to why Israel reacted the way they did. Going all the way back to how Arabs declared war on Jews in 1948 after the partition plan--the partition plan was created so that not a single Arab would have had to be displaced more than around two hours away from where they lived. But they declared war on Israel, Israel fought back, and as a result, several Palestinians were displaced either by Israeli paramilitary forces (who acted in terrible faith and were trying to get even more of the land, which they ultimately succeeded at), or were tricked out of their homes by Arab leaders who convinced them that they should leave and that they would get their homes back once the Jews were defeated. This entire war taking place right now is in response to the deadly attack on 10/7. I think that Israel has gone overboard with how they've reacted and has created a humanitarian crisis (though I'm not a military expert so I can't exactly say what they should have done differently), but do people really expect them to just not react *at all* after a terrorist attack like that? Also, all those checkpoints people complain about? The blockade? Those were created in response to suicide bombings that Palestine enacted on Israel, and rockets being fired into Israel from Gaza. Do you expect Israel to just not protect their citizens? Of course, some of it has gone way too far and can be argued as being collective punishment, but at the core, those things exist specifically to protect Israelis from being attacked, which I don't think any other country receives criticism for.  
And then if you say **""But Palestinians acted that way because they're oppressed! Occupied people have the right to exist the way they do! Again, they wouldn't be acting that way in the first place if Israel hadn't stolen their lands and displaced Palestinians from their homes!""**  
...then we're back to square one and you can go back to reading this post from the very beginning to see how this entire situation wasn't a ""stolen land"" situation and didn't really have a better way that it could have worked out.

So, if anyone actually has any ideas as to *what should have happened in 1948 instead of establishing the state of Israel*, I am seriously interested in possibly having my view changed.",Agtfangirl557,267,1306,1.0,0.3112069451591971,1709771863,/r/changemyview/comments/1b8gfs0/cmv_anyone_who_says_israel_should_never_have_been/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-07 00:37:43
1bioj6s,CMV: Libertarianism is perhaps one of the most naive viewpoints a person can have.,"To me it's pretty simple: people are selfish. If you know anything at all about human nature, you should know that humans are selfish people, that powerful people will use their power for their own ends if they can.

Libertarian belief is built around the assumption that if you allow people the freedom to regulate everything on their own, without any government intervention of any kind, we'll all be way better off. Blow away all regulations, any attempts by a greater entity to stop people from exploiting each other, and the end result will be a much better society where free markets have properly calibrated the value of everything and nobody will be exploiting each other at all!

Like, come on. You really don't think that someone's going to figure out a way to fleece you out of your money? We talk about roads a lot in reference to libertarianism, how ""we don't need the government to build roads for us"". Okay, let's say we leave road-building entirely to citizen-owned businesses. One particularly savvy roadbuilder figures out a way to convince people that HIS roads are better than everyone else's, and he succeeds. How / why? Because who gives a fuck about roads? Who is going to do their due diligence to know whether it's really true when a guy says ""well my road is made of 325X multi-plastinate gloobablop which is a far superior material""? Salesmen are great at convincing people that things are true when they probably just aren't, but if they succeed, voila, now they dominate the industry, and now that they've got all the money, they can probably use that money to shut down everyone else, out-advertise them, establish their monopoly, and now they can charge as much as they want to build their roads. You say that some other company can slide in with cheaper prices, but you're forgetting some really well-known things about humanity: people are stupid, people are lazy, people are suckers. The big monopoly company can easily push their own propaganda that their own material is superior and still have a stranglehold on the business.

I feel like anyone with the most basic understanding of humanity would understand why libertarianism would never work. That's why I've always viewed any libertarian as extremely naive and just not very smart, certainly not the least bit aware of how the world actually works.

1bqdcuj,"CMV: the normalization of online sex work/onlyfans is about as ""empowering"" as a beauty pageant.","Let me start out by saying that I'm not even necessarily anti-porn or anti-sex work at all, and in this economy I totally understand why a lot of girls feel compelled to make their money this way instead of submitting to what's essentially corporate wage slavery. My problem is not with sex work in and of itself, however, when this hustle is played off as something that's supposed to be liberating or empowering in any way shape or form is where I have to roll my eyes and draw the line.

I'm sorry, but there is nothing ""empowering"" about competitively capitalizing on how effectively your physical appearance can be fetishized and marketed in accordance with stringent hierarchical beauty standards. Commodifying how f*ckable you are to lonely, desperate men just isn't the big feminist power win a lot of these girls seem to think it is - especially when women who aren't so conventionally attractive can never hope to receive the same financial benefit for simply posting scandalous pictures of themselves online. It's not sexual liberation, it's reducing your monetary worth to how well you fit the image of what society expects a woman to look like.

If you have a smokin' hot body and wanna make a quick, cheap buck exploiting thirsty dudes online, go right ahead - but don't expect me or anyone else to cheer you on under the guise of ""girls supporting girls"" when literally all you're doing is using your looks to get ahead in life while contributing as little tangible value or labor as humanly possible.

1bmthzg,CMV: Insecurity is a perfectly valid reason to not want to date someone with an exceedingly high body count.,"I see this mentioned a lot when it comes to debates of whether or not a guy wants to date a woman that's been with a lot of men and had a ton of hookups, and I don't really see how that somehow makes it invalid to not want to date a woman over it. In fact it's pretty self aware and logical.

Insecurity is not a bad thing and it's something that all people have. Sex is an incredibly intimate and vulnerable act and men have the added factor of sexual performance is something that men are mocked for pretty regularly. This included getting mocked in a vacuum or getting compared to men your partner has been with before and coming up short (no pun intended) so it's not really a suprise that lots of guys would choose to be in a relationship where this isn't as much of an issue. 

Another aspect is that the types of guys that are able to have casual sex with women are typically incredibly conventionally attractive guys. Lots of average guys don't want to feel like they're being settled for when it comes to how sexually attractive they are to their partner, so if a woman doesn't have a sexually history that implies that, there's less of a reason to feel insecure.

If you as a man are deciding to not date a woman for one of these reasons you're not doing anything bad. You're not viewing a woman as less than for her sexual history, you're not taking out your feelings on your partner, the only thing you are doing is looking for a relationship you are comfortable in. I guess worst case scenario, you could be hypocritical if you have a high body count, but the guys that have 10+ body counts are the super conventionally attractive guys who I doubt are insecure and using more misogynistic reasons to justify not wanting to date a promiscuous woman",Tall_Promotion_7160,429,968,1.0,0.2850415948806301,1711309492,/r/changemyview/comments/1bmthzg/cmv_insecurity_is_a_perfectly_valid_reason_to_not/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-24 19:44:52
1bgukwq,CMV: Dating has become more of a chore than it supposedly being fun ,"Note: I am not American, so I am not basing culture culture off dating in America, but just generally about dating. 

Take a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/s/Eg6c0W7LEn) and you will see how taxing dating has become. 

Dating apps are basically useless for men, even for men who get some matches because women on dating apps aren’t even exactly looking to go on dates, at this point it seems like women are seeking validation and an ego boost from the tons of matches they get. 

The dating standards have become ludicrous at this point, and no, it is not “incel” to point out how the extremely high standards that a lot of women are holding for men is ridiculous. 

That’s the equivalent of me wanting a super model who vibes with me but I can’t even give anything in return. Thats exactly what dating has become now. Women seek men who are in the ‘top percentages’, but what do they provide in return? 

They are problematic and want to be treated like ‘passenger princesses’, and expect men to be both “modern and traditional” at the same time. 

Dating would have remained *simpler* if dating apps didn’t exist, but these dating apps and even social media has completely warped women’s minds because of the tons of attention women get from DM’s, and likes on Instagram and those sort. 

And a lot of the older men who will probably read this post will never understand the struggles of younger men today who are trying to date, because you never grew up in an era where women hold men to such ridiculous standards and even the average men are being seen as disposable and useless. 

At this point why even bother trying to date? Might as well stay single forever, focus on my career, take care of my parents and get a dog.

Change my view and tell me why dating isn’t a chore in today’s age, especially for younger men.

1b3neqm,CMV: Communism is not plausible and leads to totalitarianism ,"1. You cant have a stateless society because there needs to be a hierarchy. You need to have laws and regulation. So you need to have people enforcing those laws. By definition you would have state. If you have a group or people who are enforcers of laws then what is stopping them from encroaching on more power. 

2. No one is entitled to your goods and services. For example, if your home had an issue with your plumbing. Would you be entitled to someone else plumbing service? What if your home or business needed its roof repaired and it was big strenuous job. You can’t be entitled to someone’s else’s labor. Therefore they are going to name their price and highest payers get the services and communism falls apart.

3. Communism relies on perfect moral citizens to even be considered possible. You would need a crimeless society free of violence, theft, etc.. this is implausible and going back to reason number 1, because having perfect citizens and a society with no crime is implausible. You would need a hierarchy or state to enforce said laws and regulations, and controlling the means every thing. In a communist system, where the state controls the means of production and distribution, there is a centralization of authority. This concentration of power in the hands of the state can lead to a lack of checks and balances, creating an environment where a single party or leader can wield significant control.

1b7hpk5,CMV: Prostitution is not immoral. Prostitution should be legal.,"CMV: Prostitution should be legal. Prostitution itself is not immoral. 

I’ll start this by saying there is a difference between a willing prostitute/escort and a sex slave/human trafficking victim.

The whole prostitution industry should be legalized and regulated for harm reduction. I don’t think either side is evil just because the law states it is. At one point there were laws that were horrific and immoral but still the law-doesn’t mean they are right. If it was legalized, there will still probably be a black market and nefarious players in the game but legalizing it and having safer alternatives to the current situation is ideal and would reduce harm.
Pimps would have less leverage and escorts would be safer and could make a living in peace. 

A common argument I see people make is that prostitute addicts are using the money to score drugs so it’s wrong. 

1.) Not all escorts are addicts. Some of them just want money, new designer bags and material expenses to be covered. They can use their looks and sexuality because it has value. Much like how a beautiful actor or model can cash in on their appearance they should be able to do the same without the same ridicule and law enforcement threat.

2.) This common argument falls flat because there are addicts working 9-5 construction jobs, working as strippers, bartenders, bankers, lawyers and none of those professions and employers come under the same scrutiny the same way for “feeding an addiction. Addiction is a brutal lifestyle that effects everyone from every industry and all walk of life but it is on people to not do dope and if they are already on it, it’s their sole responsibility to get clean. Addiction is often rooted in trauma and I do have empathy and can understand that and feel bad for people in grips of that life but I do not think it warrants keeping the sex industry illegal. I don’t see the correlation. 

You can have sex, that’s fine.
You can pay people to do stuff, that’s also fine. But the second you pay someone to have safe sex it becomes wrong and illegal in societies eyes. The buyers and sellers of this industry should be protected.

It’s somehow legal to pay people to have sex but only if you’re recording it and making porn? The rules around it are not sound is what I’m saying therefore it should be updated and legalized for the safety and wellbeing of everyone involved. Is it the best thing you could be doing? No. But neither is drinking alcohol, smoking, gambling etc. We’ve legalized many vices that are arguably more harmful. I’m open to having my mind changed but as of right now I don’t really see a big issues with sex work.

1b5fuky,CMV: Biden is the Best Option,"
It's insane reading the amount of anti biden comments and folks spewing disinformation about Biden. Don't vote for biden but don't spew disinformation. 

-seems like alot of folks don't realize biden got the railroads workers paid sick leave the following year by threatening to withhold federal money from the railroads. 

-Biden saved the pension fund of over 350k union employees by issuing the biggest bailout in decades. Big banks always get bailed out and workers get thrown to the curb. This cost tens of billions of dollars and NEVER happens

-bidens FTC was the first FTC to successfully block a corporate merger cuz it would hurt labor and they changed the merger guidelines to ensure any mergers moving forward can't hurt labor. This is biggest thing the FTC could've done. They just blocked the Kroger merger this week in the name of labor . 

-bidens NLRB is the most pro union agency in over 50+ years. Jennifer abruzo bringing back the silk doctrine is the most pro union action action the nlrb has done in 50+ years 

- biden has required federal infrastructure projects (50k+ projects) to be done by union labor only or collective bargaining agreement 

- bidens EEOC nd NLRB have ruled more in favor for employees versus employers than any other time in history 

-bidens inflation reduction act has brought hundreds of thousands of new union jobs into the mix as folks are needed to install heat pumps and solar panels 

-Folks here don't realize how big of a deal it is to have a NLRB that's in your favor. I had a cousin who recently got her job back cuz the agency ruled in her favor for a union busting tactic her employer tried deploying. The ONLY federal agency that protects our job is the NLRB. It's like having a insurance plan on your job. When you get fired or something bad happens you want THE BEST nlrb to save your ass which is what we have RIGHT NOW.

Biden is old as hell but he's easily been the most pro union president we've ever had in 50+ years.   We have the lowest unemployment rate in history.  Biden created so many jobs with his infrastructure bill.  Biden is not the orange man who tried to overthrow our government and is a threat to our democracy.  Biden respects and understands what a democracy is.  Trump idolizes dictators.  The choice is easy.  Everyone needs to vote for him to keep our country strong and save democracy.

1b47poh,CMV: At will employment should be illegal. ,"Unless you're independently wealthy, most of us are one lay-off/firing/workplace injury away from living on the streets and having our lives absolutely turned upside down by a job loss.

I've been working for 40+ years now and I've seen people get unjustly fired for all kinds of shit. Sometimes for even just doing their jobs. 

I’ve done some human resources as well, within a few of my rules, and I’ve been asked to do some very unsavory things, like do a PIP plan for somebody they just don’t like, or for other reasons I won’t mention. If an employer doesn’t like you for whatever reason, they can just do up a PIP plan and you’re out a week later. And you’ve got no leg to stand on. You could even be doing your job, and they will let you go.

America is the only country that has Atwill employment. We are so behind and we favor the employer so much, that it puts everyone else at risk. Fuck that.

Unemployment only lasts so long and getting a job with the same salary as your previous one can take some time (years for some people).

The fact that you can get fired for sneezing the wrong way is bullshit. If you live in a state with at will employment laws you can be terminated at any time, for any reason and sometimes no reason at all. I live in Texas, and they can fire you for whatever reason. Even if the boss is sexually harassing you, even if they don’t like the color of your skin, no lawyer will help you at all and it will cost thousands and thousands of dollars even begin to sue the company, and most of the time you just lose, because you can never prove it.

Don't get me wrong, I've seen this go the other way too, where company's are too lax on problem employees and let them hang around. I just don't think with how much most people dedicate their lives to their jobs that they can just be let go for no reason and pretty much no recourse.

I think there should be an independent employment agency that deals with employee lay offs and terminations. For example, it would be like civil court, where a judge/jury looks at the facts from both parties (employer and employee) and then makes a decision from there. I know you can sue in civil court for wrongful termination, but having an agency strictly dedicated to employment issues would be more helpful for the average person (you have to have deep pockets to sue, and most people don't have that).

Side unpopular opinion: You shouldn't have to give two weeks notice before you move on from your job. If your company can dump you at any moment without telling you, the social expectation should be the other way as well.

1bnolej,CMV: Russia cannot win the war in Ukraine at this point.,"So by victory I mean achieving objectives, which we should consider at the start of the invasion, when the intention was to take Kyiv and install a puppet government, and to take much of Ukraine. 

But to expand on that, long term what could Russia's reduced goals be considered? A smaller area of Ukraine? Slowing the spread of NATO? ""de-nazification?""

I contend that in the long run none of these will happen in a way that Russia desires. To change my view on this you will need to convince me that Russia can achieve their military goals in Ukraine.

Don't come at me with Russia adjusting their goals and claiming victory, like ""well we didn't want Ukraine anyway, and our goal was to cause NATO to expand"", I am not buying that.

Here goes:

Russia on offense:

* Russian military doctrine is terrible at projecting power. Russia uses old soviet military doctrine, which is to defend the homeland on the cheap. More lower end tanks, more lower end artillery, more lower end aircraft, etc. Fewer support trucks per battalion, instead moving men, machine and supplies by rail inside Russia, And not going for air dominance but airspace denial. Using robust SAMs to deny airspace once the ground has taken.
* Russian logistics are worse than Russian military doctrine. This is the ability to provide reinforcements, ammunition, food, and other supplies to those fighting the war. Omar Bradley once said amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics, and he was correct. Keeping the war machine moving takes good logistics, and Russia is garbage at it.
* Russian maintenance practices are marred by corruption and inefficiency. Corruption has caused needed maintenance not to happen, or to be underfunded after theft of funding. And this has caused Russia to have more failures than expected in ordinance (at one point 60% of Russia's guided missiles failed to launch, target or detonate) or in equipment. (Russia has had a staggering failure rate on vehicles and aircraft. You have to do the wrench work, and Russia doesn't do it well.
* Russia's losses have been severe. Not just in human losses, having lost more soldiers to being killed or wounded, having lost perhaps 400,000 soldiers to being wounded or killed. (now more than the USA has lost in all wars going back to WW2, and now they are going into WW2 in terms of US losses) and Russia has endured. In terms of vehicles the losses are perhaps more damaging, as replacement is not as easy as another round of conscription, where we now see Russia sending T54/55 tanks into Ukraine, tanks built in 1948. Russian losses so far, per Oryx, who verifies losses via images or video:

2856 tanks  
  
1273 armored fighting vehicles  
  
3677 infantry fighting vehicles  
  
418 armored personnel carriers  
  
3175 trucks  
  
353 towed artillery   
  
706 self propelled artillery  
  
361 multiple rocket launchers  
  
106 aircraft  
  
135 helicopters  
  
21 naval ships and submarines

That is a large amount off loss for Russia, a country not able to replace their losses.

https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\_of\_the\_Russo-Ukrainian\_War

So militarily, Russia cannot project power well, and has gone about as far as they are going to go in terms of offensive actions. Russia will struggle to go any farther, and the harder they push the worse the losses will be. Will they run out of soldiers? No, but they will run out of equipment for those soldiers. As much as it was a shock to see two US sourced Bradley's kill a modern Russian T-90, a Russian T62 or T54/55 has no place on a modern battlefield, they will not last long in combat.

So that is the ability for Russia to go on offense, now let's talk Russia on defense:

* Russian defensive ability is better than their offensive ability, and it isn't close. Now their artillery and their mines have much more value, and the S400 and S500 systems are quite good, and they can deny the airspace near the front to non-stealthy Ukrainian aircraft.

If Ukraine attacks these defenses, Ukraine will take much larger losses than when defending against Russian offenses. They can and should keep fighting, but carefully, as to prevent as many losses as possible.

But in the long run, the Russian defensive ability wont save them. First, Russia hasn't achieved their goals, right now if it all ended Russia didn't achieve their goals and lost a staggering amount, right now it would be a loss if Russia didn't go back on offense...and if they did it would be a terrible idea for them.

Why wont Russian defensive capability save them? Let's talk some reality. First, if Ukraine can destroy the Kerch Strait bridge, they probably take Crimea through siege. Russia feeds and arms their forces in Crimea using that bridge, and without it their ability to continue that (bearing in mind poor Russian logistics) are compromised. Sending those supplies across the water cannot possible support their forces there and can also be targeted, and sending them through contested Ukraine is quite a lot farther and more costly, and is also in danger in the parts of Ukraine it would have to drive through.

That is Crimea eventually falling. It is a matter of when, not if.

Now the parts of Ukraine with a direct land connection to Russia? That is much more problematic. For Ukraine to take that would take military capability Ukraine, but in the end if those areas are returned to Ukraine (and again, keeping those areas is not a victory for Russia, I am speculating in what a full victory for Ukraine would look like) it will not be because they were lost militarily.

Why? Let's talk sanctions:

The sanctions are doing more than you might think. Russia is hurting. Russia is buying artillery shells from North Korea and drones from Iran, nations Russia used to supply, now they are a customer. That speaks to Russia's military industry. Russia cannot build Armada tanks to send into war, they are sending T54/55s built in 1948. And Russia cannot build more SU-57's, an aircraft not seen over Ukraine. 

Russia is mainly selling gas and oil to China and India, and they are selling it for currency that only buys goods and services from China and India. That will not help them to win the war. 

So as long as the sanctions continue, Russia's clock is ticking. They can put off the inevitable, but in the end Russia will have to abandon this war that they started. Economics demand it.

Will the sanctions end? No, not until the war ends, and not for a while after that. So the west will keep the sanctions up for as long as it takes, as that serves the interests of the west. 

Will the military aid end? No. It will slow, but we are still talking about spares, older weapons systems and ammunition which is not front of the line for NATO. This is an investment for the west into Russian defeat, and the harder Russia loses, the more secure the west is when this war is over. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, lets talk about the reality of the situation for Russia:

Russia is sending T54/55s into war, Ukraine is now sending Abrams, Leopards and Challengers. Russia cannot take steps forward, their ability to project power is a joke. Russia is getting hit at home by Ukraine, and now by terrorists. And now NATO has expanded, now closer to Russia than ever, now covering both sides of the exit from St. Petersburg, making getting submarines out in a stealthy way more difficult for Russia. And in the end Ukraine has kept fighting, and the west has kept supporting them.

Russia has succeeded to the greatest extent that they are able to militarily and economically, and can go no further, and cannot be said to have won this war.   


And the future is more bleak for Russia than the present.

&#x200B;

So please, change my view on this if you can. Convince me that it is possible for Russia to achieve their military objectives in Ukraine.",TheMikeyMac13,487,683,1.0,0.2444855346474839,1711399767,/r/changemyview/comments/1bnolej/cmv_russia_cannot_win_the_war_in_ukraine_at_this/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-25 20:49:27
1b56cgq,CMV: climbing Mount Everest is worthless and shows a level of narcissism and selfishness,"Climbing Mount Everest is a useless accomplishment and also shows a level of narcissism and selfishness, that people need to recognize. 

Basically, climbing Mount Everest achieves nothing practical. If people went up to Mount Everest to research things or collect things I could respect it more. I get that it is technically an achievement since it's hard, but it's such a ridiculous risk to your life and well-being. I think the main thing that bothers me is that you are risking your life for something so worthless. If you are going to risk your life for something, go become a firefighter or donate your kidney.

Things like: writing a book, completing a degree, knitting a shirt, cooking a meal, or getting a driver's licence have an end result. You've either made something or learned something. 

Whereas climbing Mount Everest is just literally going up somewhere and then coming back down. It's about as practical as going up the stairs, standing there for five seconds and then coming back down, and repeating the process ten thousand times. Except by doing that I don't risk dying.

I can sort of appreciate people who run marathons. I mean, it's equally useless, but it's far more safe I'm not necessarily against people doing something useless for fun but I'm just  wondering if it is the best use of your time. 

Mount Everest has a death rate of between one to five percent of all climbers. That is just the number of deaths of people who attempt to climb at all. Of the people who manage to make it past 8000m, 14 % die. 

For comparison:

running a marathon kills 1 in 259,000 of all who attempt it. 

Skydiving kills 1 in 500,000 of all who attempt it. 

Boxing is the second most deadly sport at 1 death per 7000. 

Climbing Mount Everest has a death rate of 1 in 50, and it increases to 1 in 10 once you approach the summit. 

The risk vs. reward does not pan out. A 1 in 10 chance of death just so you can say ""I climbed Mount Everest.” IT’s narcissistic and selfish and should not be rewarded.

Despite the financial contributions the US along with its European partners pay to the Palestinian territories ([US gov fact sheet](https://www.state.gov/u-s-support-for-the-palestinian-people/) from 2022), this hardly gets mentioned in the media, be it mainstream or the independent sources that make it to the wider public. While the Biden administration loses credibility among the demographic that supports him and often seems to take action or at least make statements responding to this political pressure in a way to keep his electorate, Trump is out there telling the public that he is a man of peace and that all wars will end the day he takes the presidential office. It goes without saying that Trump holds the more NATO-skeptic view of the two presidential candidates, especially after statements such as only defending countries that meet a budgeting criteria and continous efforts to stop aid to Ukraine which plays in Russia's benefit. 

Same goes in the UK (where I live). I know a lot of people who are promoting boycotts on companies that are in any way related with either Israel or the United States and are criminalising the current conservative leadership for their support for Israel. Despite the internal power struggles, the British Conservative Party has maintained its role as one of Ukraine's closest partners since the 2022 full scale invasion of Ukraine, so once again the public losing trust in the leadership could potentially lead to a change in the UK's foreign policy that might affect Ukraine negatively and thus, Russia positevely.

As for Russia's position on the Israel-Hamas war, we have Sergey Lavrov (Russia's foreign minister) taking [a clear stance](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FEoobEVZfRY) way before Oct 7, we have a souring relationship between Israel and Russia, and we have a [peace convention](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/29/palestinian-unity-on-agenda-as-hamas-fatah-leaders-to-meet-in-moscow) between Palestinian factions held very recently in Moscow.

My last argument is a clear record of Russian propaganda diguising itself in various forms of activism. In my home country (Romania) there is a popular far right party called AUR (Alliace for Union of Romanians) whose claimed main objective is the unification of Romania and the Republic of Moldova to regain historical borders. However, their leader (George Simion) has interdiction to enter both the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine (both have territories under Russian military occupation) because authorities from both countries deemed him as an asset of Russian propaganda. Members of AUR have claimed that Romania should set as an objective to take the territories from Ukraine that host Romanian ethnics. Despite AUR's claimed ideology, their actions align more with Russia's interest and they even got themselves the nickname 'Alliance for Union with Russia'. Also, there have been multiple claims of Russian involvement with environmental activists and NGOs to shift public view in their favour, such as [influencing European public against internally sourced gas exploitaitions, in order to keep Europe dependent on Russian gas.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/19/russia-secretly-working-with-environmentalists-to-oppose-fracking) Therefore I believe Russia will hide behind any side of the political spectrum to manipulate the people in the West.  


This is not to say that people who express their support and concern for the Palestinian cause are ill intended, however I think at least some of the information on the they are receiving and forwarding is playing in Russia's interests and it makes sense for Russia to invest into this information/misinformation capital.   


As a sidenote, I have travelled to both Israel and West Bank zone A (full Palestinian Authority control) a couple of weeks ago. While the main focus of my visit was on historical/archeological sites, the subject of the current conflict was unavoidable. The views on the conflict that were shared with me by Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs and Palestinians do not reflect anything that I have read or heard in the West, no matter from what side of the dispute. It was as if here in the West we are talking about a different conflict and it made me even more skeptical about how I read into news regarding external affairs. However, my CMV is about what gets to the wider public rather than debating on the actual tensions, therefore I kept my views and experiences on the matter out of my arguments.",motoci,420,732,1.0,0.238039961515226,1711043129,/r/changemyview/comments/1bkcjwv/cmv_russian_propaganda_machine_holds_a_major_role/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-21 17:45:29
1bgdwgz,CMV: Israel is responsible for providing and allowing sufficient aid into Gaza,"1. When a party occupies the territory of another party, the occupier has the responsibility to provide aid to the civilians. Israel is no exception. They have air superiority and significant IDF presence in Gaza, they are occupying Gaza and therefore they have the responsibility to provide aid. America provided sufficient aid to Afghanistan and Iraq when they invaded those countries, and Israel is no exception.

2. The only reliable way to let aid in is through the land crossings, which Israel has a monopoly over. Even though Egypt technically controls the Rafah crossing, nothing can go through without Israel's green light. It's Israel's responsibility to make sure aid from other countries are allowed into Gaza.

Does Hamas has some responsibility too? Yes, but it's unlikely that they have enough aid to provide for millions of Gazans, and they don't control the land borders like Israel does. 

The situation on the ground is absolutely dire and desperate. Not providing or at least allowing sufficient aid into Gaza is immoral and inhumane. It amounts to at best collective punishment, at worst genocidal (a word I don't use lightly).

I'd like to hear why Israel doesn't have that responsibility or if they do, why they don't have to fulfill it.",WheatBerryPie,337,805,1.0,0.2323941556843353,1710617021,/r/changemyview/comments/1bgdwgz/cmv_israel_is_responsible_for_providing_and/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-16 19:23:41

Before the over-the-counter birth control revolution in America in the 60’s and 70’s men took for granted that their wives would have kids until they couldn’t anymore. Especially catholic families. Sex was a right of the husband and, whether they planned it or not, pregnancy was a common side effect of that right. Hence the families with like, 14 kids. That meant at minimum the husband and wife had sex 14 times. Maybe the only sessions in their marriage and each session produced a child. But it was a given that the risk was always there.

With contraception women for the first time had an easy, relative to what was available in the past, option to not only gain some semblance of control over their sexual lives and bodies and unsurprisingly when they did they decided they wanted a far less children to take care of",nowlan101,678,344,1.0,0.2249535273980265,1711225942,/r/changemyview/comments/1bm24wl/cmv_based_on_the_plummeting_birth_rates_in_most/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-23 20:32:22
1b3k8ea,CMV: Arab Fundamentalist are the reason for the Israel-Gaza crisis. ,"In 1915, the region known as Palestine today still had ties to the Ottoman Empire. It wasn’t until the start of WW1 (1914) that the European nations began to consider who would control the Arab regions of the Middle East after their eventual win in WW1.

The Sykes Picot agreement in 1916, two years before WWI ended was between France and England. It declared that what is considered today Southern Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Parts of Iraq would be under control of the United Kingdom. France would control parts of Turkey, Syria and Lebanon. Prior to Sykes Picot, these “States” didn’t really have borders. Under the Ottoman Empire, borders weren’t really a thing. The Empire ruled from 1299 to 1922.

When WWII ended, Zionist in France and England deemed giving European & Middle Eastern Jews a state of the their own. They proceeded to arbitrarily draw borders. When Israel was formed in 1948, France was the primary supplier of weapons and investment. In fact, France provided Israel with their nuclear capability. France built their first nuclear reactor and gave them the bomb. In Exchange, Israeli mercenaries fought against a revolution in French controlled Algeria and France received economic benefits from selling and staffing their nuclear facilities.

Around this time, the Secular State of Egypt began their occupation of Gaza (1949 to 1956). Temporarily lost after ATTACKING Israel, again, in what is called the Second Arab Israeli War. Egypt’s military did not grant the Palestinian people independence, they occupied them. Then Egypt and consortium of nearby Arab nations attacked Israel again over the Suez Canal Crisis, which initiated the real conflict in the region…control over the economies of the region by controlling the shipping channels. Egypt had the control. President Nasser of Egypt in 1956 declared the Suez Canal a Nationalized and private resource, blocking a MAJOR shipping channel. Europe demanded shipping access, and Israel had threatened prior to 1956 that preventing the shipment of goods (without goods, you starve…like we Gaza today) to their country was an act of war and would deem a response.

Israel went on the attack and took control of Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt folded and signed a treaty to get back Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for access to the Straits of Tiran for shipping. Egypt would maintain control of the canal. Israel left Gaza and the Sinai after occupying for under a year. Egypt’s control and occupation resumed in Gaza and lasted until 1967, when once again, President Nasser of Egypt thought it wise to force of closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping. Israel attacked Egypt immediately on the Sinai Peninsula. Other Arab nations including Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon attacked Israel’s other borders. In Six Days, Israel captured the entire Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, Egyptian Occupied Gaza, the Jordanian Occupied West Bank, and the Syrian Occupied Golan Heights.

Egypt’s president Nasser resigned, and was propelled back into office. Egypt maintained a canal blockade leading to the 1970s energy crisis and the 1973 oil crisis

President Anwar el-Sedat signed the Egypt-Israel peace treaty in 1979, and relations were normalized after turbulent economic years due to the energy crisis. It was all over the control of Oil. The entire match of chess between the west, the Middle East and Russia. 

President Sedat was assassinated in 1981 by Egyptian Fundamentalist army officers. This was the beginning of Fundamentalist Islamic rule under President Mubarak who ruled until the Egyptian revolution in 2011. The Fundamentalist are the head cases we have today in the governments Syria, Yemen and the likes of Libya. Evil people in power. Pure evil. If there was a Satan, it would be Islamic Fundamentalist (or Putin). The kind of people who see a beheading as a normal act of control. 

Israel withdrew from all of Gaza in 2005 until the cycle of Palestinian suicide bombings, rocket attacks and knife attacks sparks a military-police state response from Israel. Now, Israeli citizens were growing into Warhawk nationalists under Netanyahu. They were hitting back harder. Palestinians threw rocks, Israel shot back. Tensions continued to grow and Iran saw opportunity to fund a military presence to actuate a proxy war with Israel. Israel responded with civil rights abuses, allowed for more settlements, and created a blockade on goods to the region. The surrounding Arab nations of pissed, but wouldn’t help the Palestinians as they never did before either. They all start increasing terrorist activities via Iran. Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. 

After Israel left Gaza in 2005, the region’s terrorists saw it as a success and increased activities. Gaza elected Hamas as their government in 2006. This brings us to today, my friend. The Palestinians people have been used as pawns for over 60 years passing hands between Arab control and Israeli retaliation, terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens by Iranian backed militias and severe Israeli retaliation…to the point where we have the human rights crisis on our hands. There is only one solution, eradicate terrorism and teach Israel to find its heart.

1bez3lx,"CMV: The majority of incels aren't bad people, just guys that were dealt a bad hand in life and get mocked for it.","I think the way that ""incel"" is now becoming common insult against any man (regardless of whether or not he's an incel) is pretty concerning and demonizes a lot of men who just happen to be in a bad position.

For young people, an increasing number of men are being completely shut out of the dating field. Dating is becoming more superficial and more and more men are failing to meet the cut. If you look at statistics on young people dating, somehow a significantly larger amount of women are actively dating than men. I'm not going to say this is unfair, because it's not. It's not unfair for women to choose whoever they want to date. That being said, that doesn't really mean anything for how the men that are unable to date feel. Again, I'm not saying these men are entitled to women, but desire and negative emotions out of being unable to fulfill those desires are not going to go away just because you aren't entitled to women.

Men are romantically lonely. I know many people will say to just build friendships, but if friendships were enough for humans, no one would likely take the risk it is to get romantically entangled with someone. Most humans have a desire for romantic companionship, and in the world we live in some people just won't get that. For a lot of men, I would argue through no fault of their own. People will fight me on this and say ""if you can't find a girlfriend or can't get laid it's you're fault"" but I would like to ask a question. 

Do you think that it is possible for bad things to happen to people who do everything in their power to be good and do things right? Can a person who did everything right at their job, came in early, stayed late, and worked hard still be laid off? Of course they can. Unless you don't believe that, it's not consistent to think the same can't apply to dating. Life's just not fair, you can do everything right and still fail.

At the end of the day humans are animals and in the animal world, only the genetic best get to have partners. Sure humans deviated from that, but only after men practically enslaved women and made it so they couldn't survive in society without a father or husband and could be sold to men like cattle. It's not like that anymore and as a result, the more ""human"" dating practices are reemerging.

Some people are just dealt shitty hands and end up involuntarily celibate. Being an incel doesn't inherently mean you're a misogynist.  Hell the person who coined the term was a woman. Yet being an incel and incels are seen as punching bags and insult fodder even if they're not misogynistic. I've seen people telling just guys on reddit they look like incels. You can't tell me that they were trying to say they look like misogynists when many attractive men are also misogynists. They're talking about virginity and being unable to attract a partner. That's a sign people view these traits as something worthy of mocking, and it's not right.",Tall_Promotion_7160,120,939,1.0,0.2068203074306938,1710458006,/r/changemyview/comments/1bez3lx/cmv_the_majority_of_incels_arent_bad_people_just/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-14 23:13:26
1bjjd5t,"CMV: jobs requiring constant physical labour deserve to be paid a lot than they currently are. Especially when comparing to the pay of other jobs, that don’t require physical labour, like a desk job. ","I don’t understand how people breaking their backs everyday, putting their bodies through hell, can get paid minimum wage. The future impact this sort of work has on your body after decades of wear and tear is astonishing. 

The medical bills and terminal pain that physical labourers experience in their old age is NOT worth getting paid minimum in their youth. Minimum wage is not worth the cost of the medical bills they will be experiencing in the future.

I have the opinion that people working on the loading dock and busting their butts deserve to be compensated the same as someone like a banker, a lawyer, or even a neurosceintist. It’s not fair that physical labourers get paid insanely less, but then also have to deal with expensive medical bills in the future. I can see why Lenin or Karl Marx had the opinions they had, it’s because their way of thinking is a lot more fair for **EVERYONE** . I can imagine people being against a communist system if they were born into privledge, and don’t want to share their wealth.

I happen to work at a loading dock for Walmart and this job is nothing like I expected. When you receive a job offer from the #1 company on the Fortune 500 list, you expect the job to be at least decently cushy, and to compensate well. That’s not the case. My co-workers recently informed me that we make the absolute bare-minimum income that they can legally pay us in this province. It’s a living heck hole in that loading dock area and most of my co-workers are at the bottom of society, barely scraping together a living. Tell me how the CEO can make millions of dollars while we’re working harder than him?! How does that make sense. This isn’t happening just with Walmart too, this is many billion dollar companies around the world.

I want to abolish the far-right economic system we have right now, and I want to bring in more aspects of communism. That doesn’t mean I want to be full communist but I do want workers to be compensated like it is a communist society. There is no way that you can tell me a banker works harder than I do, when I’m sweating my balls off carrying 50-100 lb boxes, **MY ENTIRE 6 HOUR SHIFT** . Professional athletes get paid millions for training everyday and there’s an argument that me and my co-workers are arguably putting our bodies through much much worse, but get compensated so much less. 

Lebron James makes $45 million a year. He plays roughly 100 games in a season (including playoffs), and each game is 48 minutes. 100 x 48 = 4800 minutes. 45 million / 4800min = $9374/minute.

$9375 x 60 min = $562,500/hour

That’s how much Lebron gets paid. Now let’s calculate how much I get paid per hour compared to him, and why don’t you capitalistic, fantastical economic ‘geniuses’ explain how that’s fair. Spoiler alert, #ITS NOT . But I digress. 

$15/562,500 x 100 = 0.00266%

**Let me say that again for the neoconservatists in the back** . My salary is 0.00266% of Lebrons. And all he does is throw a rubber ball through a metal ring… it’s complete bush league.

I’d like someone to argue against the fact that physical labour jobs need a LOT more compensation, and that a communist economic system is a lot more fair than a ‘free market’ one. I’m not saying we should be getting paid the exact same as Lebron James or a neuroscientist but it shouldn’t be anywhere near what it is now, and it frankly shouldn’t be anything past double our salary. Because there is no argument for them working double as hard as me, when I’m working as hard as I possibly can every day. I work so hard that I have been taking adhd pills from my coworkers every shift just to get through it. 

P.S. it’s funny that they call it a ‘free market economic system’ when I’m literally a slave to the system, sacrificing my youth and body for chump change. Us physical labourers are anything but free.

1bik8yd,CMV: Arabs/Muslims are the colonizers and privileged group throughout the entire Middle East ,"So in the west we see white Christian’s hold this status of power in society. 

We see the same in the Middle East with Muslims/arabs. There are so many minority groups that have been persecuted and simply exterminated throughout the Middle East through Islamization and arabization. Assyrians, Kurds, Christians, Zoroastrians, bahais, coptics, Druze, etc. 

We see these groups having to hide their identities

It’s interesting because we often paint the Arabs/muslims with the same brush as people of color and oppressed minorities. We also say that Arabs lived in peace over there until the west got involved, but cmon that is so far from the truth. There has been war and ethnic cleansing in the Arab world since forever. Christianity was the main culprit for awhile until Islam took over then Christianity again then Islam again. And now it’s mainly Muslim. Except for one controversial state (Israel) 

Arabs have been colonizing the berbers in North Africa and Kurds in Iraq, Syria and Iran. 

So although the onset and creation of the state of Israel is controversial, it is interesting to see how many minority groups in the Middle East actually support Israel, unlike the average Muslim/arab in the Middle East. Sure, Israel was made by Ashkenazi Jews, but many many Jews all over the Middle East found refuge in the state of Israel. And why is it through out the Middle East we see Muslim controlled countries. They are not democracies, and if they are, they severely restrict rights and Islam is very much the ruling power. (Albeit a few) 

You may argue and say “that is their culture and we should respect it” but that is the majority (now) culture, that isn’t the only culture/religion/ethnic group.

Arabs have a history of brutal slavery and colonization. So why do we often group them in with oppressed group? 

(Gaza is a different scenario, as they are clearly oppressed today. But again, they were used as pawns by the Arab world to prevent a minority group from gaining any power … the jews) 

And let’s not forget about dhimmi hood in the Islamic religion, anyone who ain’t Muslim is seen as a second class citizen and isn’t represented, pays jizzyah tax, etc.

1b86sfc,"CMV: if you want to practice the extreme version of your religion, move to those countries who allow it ","
Why do you move to let’s say Norway and you’re an extreme Orthodox Jew, Sharia supporting Muslim and want to imply your rules and living standard to that country? 

Why can’t you adapt since you want to move elsewhere, you can’t move to a not so religious country and then want certain areas to be for different genders, have different clothings etc and create a whole different culture in that country, why don’t you just move to those countries that allow such things?

Like for example in Iran there’s tons of women who want to get the fuck out because of the discrimination towards womens freedoms and rights, yet people want to imply those rules in other non religion countries.  

There’s people who are sadly born into these extreme religions and are brainwashed into thinking it’s ok and normal to for example hide your whole face, not being in the same room, area or restaurant with the opposite gender and now we’ve created a bigger segregation between the ethnic group and those people (when I saw ethnic group I include those who have immigrated but have adapted to the country’s culture and values)

Like for example here in London people want sharia law and that for example says that if a woman gets raped then there needs to be 4 male witnesses or else it’s invalid. There’s people who are born in a country who doesn’t have these values but are still brainwashed into thinking it’s okay and I think you should move to that country that allows it and let those who want to escape such living situations escape it. 

I can’t tell you how many people have been killed in non religious countries because their sister had a boyfriend or because they didn’t cover their knees like are you serious.

To be honest I think you should only be allowed to practice your religion behind closed doors and not bring it to the public, and if you don’t like it why not move? I don’t want to hear prayers, see discriminatory clothes and eventually dangerous laws.

1bapzpn,CMV: Most people in the US are completely deranged about sex and nudity,"The title speaks for itself really, but to elaborate:

* Most Americans have negative overreactions to sex and nudity that are disconnected from any potential harm.
* While sex and nudity can cause harm, e.g. a flasher is sexually harassing people, not everyone who is nude is a flasher. Being able to differentiate nonsexual nudity from sexual nudity and from someone using nudity to harass is a skill most Americans lack.
* This lack of differentiation then gets scaremongered into overreactive policies and everyone being accused of being a sexual predator, in a similar way to 9/11 lead to random innocent people being accused of being terrorists and security theater becoming the norm, with the usual preoccupation with protecting 'normal Americans' from outsiders via norms and propriety - ""we don't do that here"" - rather than real harm reduction focused on real threats.
* Children are as usual weaponized as an excuse to police the actions of others, instead of teaching children age appropriate lessons about sex and nudity to prepare them for public life.
* Not talking openly about sexuality nor educating people beyond the mechanics of sex leads to many Americans not understanding what their own sexuality is and being unable to understand sensual, sexual or romantic expression and how these interact with the public realm.
* This becomes a cultural vicious circle: people are told nudity is bad, told that it's not normal, so they don't expect it, so they feel surprised and scared by it, so they feel it's bad.
* Younger Americans are often additionally hamstrung by absorbing discourse around private sexual consent that does not include the public sphere, leading them to think that they can 'not consent' to other people doing things they don't want to see. Combined with young people's general distaste for older bodies, this becomes ""that old person is creepy"" as code for accusing them of sexual harassment.
* Some in the US kink communites have tried to assuage the fears of the average American, unfortunately lending them further confidence that they are correct because the kink community 'agrees' with them, ignoring that this came from pragmatism.
* The US rightwing are even more poisonous with their fears about sexuality, even going so far as thinking dancing in public is evidence of pedophilia if they think the dancing is too sexy (or black).
* People in other countries are also just as bad as the US or worse; this post isn't saying *only* the USA has issues with puritanism.

1bjx989,CMV: my ancestors owned slaves and I don’t really care. ,"So I’m talking about US slavery here in case that needs to be said. I grew up always knowing this, but I was confused why my mom seemed particularly ashamed of the fact that one of her ancestors owned slaves. 

The matter came up in conversation recently and some peers were kind of astonished that this isn’t something I feel a need to “make right,” or feel really anything about whatsoever. My ancestors owning slaves is a statement of basic fact that I don’t feel any real connection to whatsoever.

The idea that I’d even consider this to have any connection to or influence over my life is frankly absurd to me. One of my friends was even saying how like his brother in law or something found and reached out to descendants of slaves his family owns, I can’t even bring myself to explain the violations of privacy and just general pointlessness I see in this action. 

I am going to make the following general statements, which I hold to be true, to help clarify some things. The first two shouldn’t need clarification but I don’t want to have to type them out later:

1. My ancestors committed a horrible crime.

2. Slavery is evil. 

3. Modern black people in America suffer from lingering effects of centuries of slavery. 

4. “Slaves” is plural in the post, we are talking about a lot of slaves. This was a southern aristocratic family whose name is on the constitution, several people have Wikipedia articles and were involved in state government. Big time slave owners. 

As for why I don’t care: I cannot point to any direct influence this has had on my life. As far as I am aware, my specific lineage was disinherited. I grew up in a rather typical middle class family. The slave owners’ nonexistent influence over my life obviously dwarfs the influence I ever had over their actions. 


If one could assign an exact dollar amount to which I have benefited then I’d be willing to have a more serious inquiry into whether I owe anything to anybody. Any “debt” I have is basically completely speculative, and I really emphatically doubt any action on my end would ever be viewed as a complete atonement anyway. 

Moreover, I really doubt that anyone’s lineage is really completely perfectly morally upstanding by modern standards if you start going back 5 generations anyway.

1bp73vl,CMV: Online dating is dead.,"I feel like I tried all sorts of apps for about two years - Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, OKCupid, CoffeeMeetsBagel, and even FaceBook Dating. But the results were consistent regardless of the platform, where likes/matches were so rare, I never even got to plan a date. Furthermore, I've grown more and more doubtful that it's just me. I've been hearing many anecdotes, for what those are worth, that suggest that online dating in general has been downhill.

Plus, most apps have been bought out by MatchGroup, a publicly-traded company that's lost over 75% in stock price value since the vaccines rolled out in 2021. Indeed, when a company is ostensibly offering a service that's suppose to help people connect even in a basic way, but then rolls out a fourth paid subscription tier for Tinder that costs $500 per month, then I'm not sorry for thinking that they may not have my social/romantic interests in mind.

So, I've personally written off the whole concept, even though I do have at least three relatives that've met their partner via an app, albeit years ago. But this year, I'm ready to try other ways of meeting people, like volunteering, checking out events held at art galleries, film festivals, and more.

Now, if you can convince me that online dating is still alive in some way - or at least somehow hasn't gotten worse over the last three years - then I'd be genuinely impressed. I also don't want to hear any gaslighting that claims that I'm overrating my attractiveness; even if I was in denial, is attractiveness not subjective, at least to some degree? Now, I'm not gonna claim I'm as attractive as a Hollywood actor, but I feel a solid bit above average, too, and I've got a close female friend that's called me charming, respectful, and brilliant. Meanwhile, in online dating, I find it very hard to convey those attributes, at least in the very initial stages - but I digress.

I'm also not incapable of blaming myself and taking on personal responsibility. But I think we need to admit that sometimes, when you don't get the results you're hoping for, it's not always your fault.",Bifocals_of_Argus,355,507,1.0,0.1799539077707918,1711559282,/r/changemyview/comments/1bp73vl/cmv_online_dating_is_dead/,2024,3,changemyview,2024-03-27 17:08:02

1bdf7cv,"CMV: Pushing for Platonic relationships is not an adequate solution to the ""male loneliness epidemic"" ","Young men are lonely and struggling to find relationships. And one of the major solutions I see being talked about is that men need to focus more on platonic friendships and hobbies. 

Now. I'm pansexual, but happily in a relationship with a beautiful woman who I love and treasure. And for the sake of my argument here I'm going to list the things I've gained and the needs I've had met being in a relationship that Ive never had through platonic relationships. 

And I'll be up front. One of the major things I feel will be needed to change my mind is an outline on how the average man can have those same needs mostly met through platonic friends without needing to find new ones in more ""progressive"" populations that are less homophobic and averse to male on male intimacy among other things. 

So to start. 

We split rent for a one bedroom space. This means we can go out more often and afford a better quality of life. My friends have never wanted to share a room.

We share chores and housework. When she's working I make the meals. When im working she does. We both do the dishes. But I do stuff like laundry and cleaning the toilet because she doesn't like those things. So she takes care of the chores I don't like. My friends don't live with me. They live with their partners. 

We can lean on one another financially. She works freelance, no clients equals no pay. She still pays her bills but I can make sure we both have good groceries for the week because I know she'll get the next batch.  And vice versa. My friends may offer a meal or a couch to stay on. But I can't rely on them. 

We can lean on one another emotionally. If she's having a bad day or her anxiety flares up I can be there to hold her and calm her down. And when I'm feeling hurt or upset or lonely. She's there to hold and cuddle me. My friends only really cuddle or hold their partners and family. 

We help each other with our body image/self esteem.   She compliments me when she sees me naked. She makes me feel like I'm attractive and desirable and I do the same. My friends don't want to see me without clothes. 

We help one another with our self esteem and aesthetic choices. We can go clothes shopping together and point out things that one another would look good in. And I can ask her if I look like shit and get an honest answer. My male friends don't see clothes shopping as social and my female friends don't like a guy tagging along. 

There's plenty more I could think of if I gave this some time and effort but the overarching point is that there are numerous benefits to being in a romantic relationship that simply aren't reasonable to ask for from platonic friends

Men making more friends won't change the fact that society still largely expects people to ""pair up""

Why does the worker also not get a two week notice to find employment? I mean a business is not as hurt by someone leaving as a person is if they suddenly end up thrown out of a means of income.

I think this is too hopeful of a statement, like saying we will have world peace in ten years. 

Woman are so dangerously hyper sexualised and always have been, and so going into it for “empowerment” doesn't feel sincere to me. Financial freedom is definitely empowering but not the how it's been achieved. Our self worth is tied to many things, one of them being how we spend are time and earn a living. Of course this isn't the case for everyone but it is for many. 

Because with sex work, while the money side may be empowering, the act itself is not. Not if you are happy with people valuing your worth based off your genitals and animal nature. Something we all possess and didn't need to work for. 

  
I am sure there are people reading this ready to write in the comments how judgemental I am, and perhaps thats true. I really don't mean to come across that way. I do respect peoples decision to go into the sex industry and not telling anyone not to do it. I am just wondering if there's anyone who can truly say that having sex with strangers and in front of a camera crew is something respectful, or if its societies pressure to be ""woke"" that makes people feel inclined to hold something that women have always been shamed for by so many men as respectful out of sympathy. 

What I am saying isn’t so much my truth, but the truth of most peoples. Since humanity has existed, sexism towards women has existed on a much greater scale than sexism towards men. There are many ways to claim power without going into something that you wouldn't want your own children to do if you spent 18 years providing them with everything you can for a good life.

1bjqcm5,CMV: Conservatives do not care about facts.,"I am posting this in good faith, hopefully it will be taken as such.

I have had many debates with conservatives and simply put I do not believe that they care at all about facts and specifically evidence. Let me explain. I will be debating with a conservative and they will say something completely outrageous or just factually wrong. I will ask for evidence or proof of their claim and one of two things will happen. Either A. They will call me an idiot and tell me that I'm not worth the effort. (Cop-out) or B. They will just say that what they said is true because ""everyone knows it's true"" or some version of that statement. 

I like to bring facts and data into a debate because it seems that the person with more evidence on their side is the correct one, yet whenever I bring up these facts conservatives will brush them aside and just tell me that I'm wrong, despite the evidence.

Recently I was talking about the fact that migrants commit less crimes than citizens and despite all the facts and data all that was brushed aside for feelings.

This leads me to believe that conservatives:

1. Hold a lot of beliefs without facts to back them up.
2. Do not care about facts when presented with them.

A couple months ago I was hanging out with a bunch of friends (mostly women, two men, not including me) and one suddenly started talking about how she ""hated all men"" and went on about how much she hated all men and how all men should be killed.

While I understand that there are a lot of bad or evil men, and a lot of/all the men she had interacted with might be part of that group, but that can't mean everyone is.

I then said, confused, ""isn't that too much of a generalization?"" and ""there's gotta be, you know, an adjective before 'men' right?""

She didn't answer then, but one of the other girls sent me a message after, saying that the girl was furious about what I said.

Another thing is when I said, at a later time, that ""for example, what if I were to say: Women are bad drivers and get into car crashes all the time, therefore I hate all women"" (not that I believe that, of course)

She then replied ""It's not the same thing"" which also confuses me.

For short: I think it's ok to hate a group of (in this case) men, but grouping everyone with the people that rob, attack or rape people and therefore saying that you hate them doesn't make sense to me.

1ch2b60,CMV: Religious people are excessively accomodated,"I believe that the fact that these accommodations must be recognized often amounts to discrimination against those who are not religious as it implies religious beliefs to be more important than non-religious beliefs. To give an example in parts of Canada and in the UK Sikhs are permitted to ride a motorcycle without a helmet despite it being illegal for anyone else to do the same.  By doing this the government has implied that Sikhism is a more virtuous belief than any other than could involve one choosing not to wear a helmet. Another non Sikh could choose not to wear a helmet simply because they believe that 'looking cooler' on the bike is worth the health risk of not wearing a helmet and by not allowing this the government is implying that the Sikh principles are superior to the principals of maximizing how cool one looks. It is also unfair that taxpayers in the countries will be forced to pay the excessive healthcare bills stemming from the more severe injuries caused by the lack of helmet. A more reasonable solution would be that anyone who chooses not to wear a helmet must pay an extra annual fee to cover the added healthcare costs.

&#x200B;

Another better example would be the fact that Kirpans (knives) are allowed to be carried onto airplanes by Sikhs but not by anyone else in Canada. The religious reason for wearing a Kirpan is in part self defense yet if any other Canadian chooses to carry a knife for self defense reasons it is a violation of the law and they would rightly be denied permission to bring one onto an airplane. Therefore self defence as a principle is honored by the government when it is packaged as part of a religion but not when it is just an important belief held by an individual. The Supreme Court of Canada even went so far as to say this about a kid bringing a kirpan to school

>Religious tolerance is a very important value of Canadian society.  If some students consider it unfair that G may wear his kirpan to school while they are not allowed to have knives in their possession, it is incumbent on the schools to discharge their obligation to instil in their students this value that is at the very foundation of our democracy.

this is a perfect demonstration of the mindset I described. As a non-religious person none of your personal beliefs are required to be taken with the same level of seriousness as a religion's beliefs. I fail to see why this mindset should be held as it is not a fact that religion is some kind of objectively good thing.

1cbrfoe,"CMV: American Jews on the Left are expected to tolerate a level of blatant antisemitism from POC, both personally and more broadly, that would be inconceivable if roles were reversed. ","The blunt truth about it is, American Jews are more concerned with appearing racist then black or Latino Americans are with being antisemitic. Or, if they do think it’s antisemitic they think it takes a backseat to their own struggles against discrimination. Because — most of them — are white. If they think about it at all. It may be no less conscious then something you grow up around hearing. 

This isn’t to say that there isn’t *lots* of work to do in the “white” community still when it comes to race relations *and* antisemitism or that this discrimination cancels out the other, it’s just to say that this is a real problem in the black community. While they were never ever representative of a majority of black Americans, the Nation of Islam was and continues to be an influential part of African America life, especially in cities. 

And if you agree protocols of the elders of Zion is antisemitic book, then you’d agree that an organization that takes its cues on the topic of Jews from such a antisemitic book would likely be, by extension antisemitic. Well early NOI was very much such an organization. And if that organization had deep roots in certain segments of black America it would probably be somewhat worthwhile to consider its effects.  

All this to say, there’s a reason Kanye West — who coincidentally also defended Louis Farrakhan from correct accusations of antisemitism — is still embraced by hip-hop fans and rappers today and if anything seems to be making a comeback of sorts.

Not that me saying this really matters. The people whose opinion this would change don’t read this and they’d only listen to people they respect within their local community. But it does look, to the outside viewer at least, that there’s a lack of reciprocity. 

During the George Floyd protests the arguments for taking to the streets to demand justice and reform society o prevent antiblack racism from killing more Americans or destroying more lives, were rooted in appeals to fundamental appeals to human rights to God.

1c40sa9,"CMV: I struggle to understand why the crisis of masculinity is even a thing, why so many young men listen to the manosphere or influencers in general, etc. I think it is a case of crisis of independence rather than crisis of masculinity.","The current conversation about masculinity (in the US) confuses me very much, and I say this as a man. I grew up in a fairly stable middle class household, parents divorced in my early teens. I joined the US military at 18, served for a few years, and travelled around the country. After my service I started college and am soon entering my senior year. Why am I telling you all this?

I've always considered myself a highly independent person. I've also figured out a lot of things in my life on my own, to include how to rent an apartment, saving for retirement and amassing decent wealth for my age, entering and being successful in school, having a fair number of romantic partners. By many metrics of modern masculinity, I've done well for myself. But this also leaves me confused as to what men are missing from their lives or what they're having a crisis over.

I've never felt the need to have someone validate my masculinity (as it seems that needing someone else for that kinda defeats the point). Truth be told, ""being masculine"" has never really mattered to me much because its always seemed to be buying in to what someone else thinks is a necessary way to live your life--which returns me to my independence point. The rise of influencers and the manosphere has also seemed to be a weird proxy for mentors in many men's lives, which has always seemed to be a case of being far too online for too long in my opinion. I've also never really leaned on many mentors in my life, but that is probably by own bias showing, I'm sure many people get a lot of guidance out of mentor figures.

This altogether is to say that it seems that this crisis of masculinity is at its core a crisis of independence and men unable or unwilling to figure out their lives for themselves. Perhaps it was the military that ultimately gave me this independent foundation, but I think that proves my point--that it is independence and what it gives you than anything that masculinity is doing for people. The point is not that masculinity is failing or unstable, but that men are unable to be independent and take charge of their independence for themselves. Why, I'm not sure exactly--rent is high and wages are low, but women seemingly aren't having as much of a crisis about themselves these days. Many seem to be enjoying and embracing independence instead.

1c4wp1m,CMV: Dating apps massively contributed to the rise of manosphere/incel ideology,"I've been reading a lot of posts from those subscribed to manosphere stuff here, and I've come to realise that a huge part of why this is happening is the use of dating apps to get dates. The apps basically force everyone to judge a person by a few pictures and a short prompt and give the impression that how you look is all that matters in a relationship, when often people fall in love after knowing and talking to someone. Given that men outnumber women on these apps, it's not surprising that men would find themselves in a highly competitive environment when in reality it's much closer to 50/50. This imbalance left a lot of younger men disappointed at themselves and, worse yet, women for not getting dates. I have this sense that dating apps market themselves as a way to find love, but for a lot of men it's just something that they find upsetting and disappointing. And when someone doesn't have the right support and structure, they would find the manosphere ideology appealing because it feels like their failures have been answered, even though obviously the ideology falls apart at the smallest scrutiny.

I'm sure some people will attribute this to patriarchy, but this manner of demeaning women hasn't been mainstreamed for many many decades, and patriarchy certainly wasn't any weaker back then, so in my view the best explanation is the perception that dating apps is the only way to get dates.",WheatBerryPie,1646,498,0.8899999856948853,0.5273030390685824,1713213042,/r/changemyview/comments/1c4wp1m/cmv_dating_apps_massively_contributed_to_the_rise/,2024,4,changemyview,2024-04-15 20:30:42
1c79zco,"CMV: If you don't singularly blame Hamas for rejecting reasonable ceasefire proposals at this point, you both don't actually want a ceasefire or a release of hostages. And it is damaging the effectiveness of the ceasefire protest movement by not blaming Hamas and instead Israel.","According to all information I can find, the only thing holding up a reasonable ceasefire deal at this point is Hamas. The US has extensively pushed Israel to agree to a proposal that includes releasing 700-900 prisoners, many with life sentences, a return of Palestinians to the north, in exchange for 40 hostages from Hamas and a 6 week ceasefire.

[https://www.axios.com/2024/04/08/us-israel-hamas-hostage-deal-propose-ceasefire](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/08/us-israel-hamas-hostage-deal-propose-ceasefire)

Hamas flatly rejected these proposals and said it won't budge from its main demands of ""a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of the occupation army from the entire Gaza Strip, the return of the displaced to their areas and places of residence, intensification of the entry of relief and aid, and the start of reconstruction""

[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-rejects-israels-ceasefire-response-sticks-main-demands-2024-04-13/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-rejects-israels-ceasefire-response-sticks-main-demands-2024-04-13/)

But those aren't reasonable demands. Reasonable meaning a ceasefire built around things both sides obviously won't agree to. Israel won't agree to basically surrender and leave Gaza without the hostages, and Hamas won't agree to surrender either. 

But Israel isn't making ""Hamas must surrender"" as a main demand if its proposal. Hamas is with respect to Israel.

Which is why the US blames Hamas for not having a ceasefire. 

[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-has-moved-significant-way-hamas-remains-barrier-gaza-hostage-deal-us-says-2024-04-15/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-has-moved-significant-way-hamas-remains-barrier-gaza-hostage-deal-us-says-2024-04-15/)

And the second part of my cmv is that the pro ceasefire protest movement is damaging both the goal of getting a ceasefire deal done and by raising support for Palestinians more generally, but not admitting Hamas as the clear obstacle here. Because why support the protestors when reasonable people on the fence about this conflict can easily see in the news Hamas rejecting ceasefire deals, let alone reporting Hamas won't even give a list of hostages still alive and that they don't have enough hostages to fill the original 40 women, elderly and wounded category?

1bx9zvu,CMV: western young men are becoming more conservative in terms of their views on sexuality,"One thing parallel between my muslim home country and western world is the unpopularity of feminism among men. Indeed, I observed in every country around the world, men are far more likely to hate feminism than women. 

But there is another thing that is increasingly becoming popular among young male western audience, that is emphasis on low body count which seems to be some kind of revival of purity culture. It’s more pronounced online. A lot of posts here on the topic of body count attract hoards of men trying to assert not just how it matters, but how it matters more for women than men. It’s not only on reddit. Take instagram, X, facebook and tiktok as well. 


I’m left rather confused regarding what these men precisely mean by low body count. Back in my home country, the consensus is that a woman should be virgin before marriage. With western male audience, I do find a lot of men saying they want or prefer virgins, but the majority seems to be drawing arbitrary lines. The benchmark is sometimes 3, and other times 5. Some move it even further as well. 


I’m skeptic of claims such as men ideally prefer virgins, since past research has shown decreasing value of chastity among men in the western world.

1c0vth7,CMV: Eating a dog is not ethicallly any different than eating a pig,"To the best of my understanding, both are highly intelligent, social, emotional animals. Equally capable of suffering, and pain.

Yet, dog consumption in some parts of the world is very much looked down upon as if it is somehow an unspeakably evil practice. Is there any actual argument that can be made for this differential treatment - apart from just a sentimental attachment to dogs due to their popularity as a pet?

I can extend this argument a bit further too. As far as I am concerned, killing any animal is as bad as another. There are certain obvious exceptions: 

1. Humans don't count in this list of ""animals"". I may not be able to currently make a completely coherent argument for why this distinction is so obviously justifiable (to me), but perhaps that is irrelevant for this CMV. 
2. Animals that actively harm people (mosquitoes, for example) are more justifiably killed. 

Apart from these edge cases, why should the murder/consumption of any animal (pig, chicken, cow, goat, rats)  be viewed as more ok than some others (dogs, cats, etc)?

40 hours a week is 24% of one's life. That amount of time should be valued enough by society to grant someone dignity and the ability to cover their basic needs. 

Looking at minimum wage jobs, a worker at McDonald's works harder than many high earning professions, doing a job not many others are willing to do, to provide a service that society would miss if no one was willing to work it. Even low skill jobs, apply stress, exhaustion, and sacrifice of time out of their lives. 

I would also argue that many minimum wage jobs are more important to daily functions of the public, than a lot of cushiony mid to higher level experience jobs, otherwise these jobs wouldn't exist.

People often use the example that a teenager in school doesn't need to make a living wage, however if they are working full time, perhaps they do. Regardless, their effort and the time committed to working said job should warrant the same pay, if they put in the same hours.

1bu11sl,CMV: I believe society let female harasser and predators get away with things lightly just because people find it hard attributing such behavior to women,"
I work as a male stripper , and I encounter a lot of evil, manipulative and predatory women in my line of work. They are more common in the rich and “high profile” parties/clients . 

And I find it odd how no one talks about it. And how it’s low key rewarded by society.


When I first started modeling and dancing, I was good at my job where I ended up being invited to more high profile parties to just perform. I was in my early 20s. Perform to rich , famous people sometimes even.

And my first encounter with sexual harassment was in one of these parties by one of these rich/popular women.

I froze and let it happen. 

But then when I told my manager and colleagues , I was always told to “man up” or “you should feel lucky” or “many guys would pay to be in that position” and so on.

I guess it didn’t help that these clients held a lot of power in terms of money and influence that the managers would side with them and just train us to let it happen and enjoy and shut up about it . 

Being a nobody who was young , being paid good and peer pressured into it being a good thing . You get used to it. 

Because to society , when a woman is the predator , it’s seen as hot.

And it’s not even about me being a man , it happens to female dancers as well , and the response is very different when its a woman taking advantage of her power compared to men. 


I just find it odd . Maybe I’m wrong but I just felt like sharing my point of view

1c8rxy4,CMV: Polyamory is just a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal.,"Three years ago, my ex partner unilaterally demanded we open our marriage during a trip with friends where I couldn't escape or even have a healthy conversation about it, then threatened to leave if I didn't comply when we came home.   
  
I begged and pleaded, but eventually relented. Then, after a few months I began to explore the literature and rules of polyamory in online support groups and became curious about finding my own relationships outside of our marriage (I realised later that this was mostly to escape the abuse I was still putting up with at home, which had persisted for for years).   
  
When I told my partner that I was also curious to find other people, she exploded in a terrifying rage that I am still struggling to understand. She accused me of just taking advantage of her 'coming out polyamorous first' in our marriage, insisted that I couldn't possibly be polyamorous because I am autistic, and finally demanded I 'prove' to her (somehow) that I ever felt love for another person other than her. 

When I couldn't come up with an example other than the one other crush I had before we began officially dating six years prior, she again threatened to leave, screaming at me for being a misogynist, and all I could do was beg for forgiveness and cry myself to sleep. 

She apologised days later, but halfheartedly and still accused me of being both a misogynist and narcissist who needed therapy and we scheduled couple's therapy together with a poly-friendly therapist. 

Two months later--and four days before our appointment--she cheated on me. 

She came home and confessed while begging for forgiveness in another whirlwind of pain, and again I gave her a pass as I was now terrified of being abandoned--only for her to buy a one-way ticket to Portland the next morning. 

I never saw her again. 

She filed for divorce 1,000 miles away, leaving me with our two cats and a whole heap of debt. I still went to our therapist appointment somehow, but alone. She was incredible. She helped me understand the full extent of the abuse I had been suffering for years and convinced me that polyamory and narcissism often intersect--but don't necessarily have to. 

But it still didn't help, and I checked myself into an emergency outpatient facility after a suicide attempt.

Things stabilised, but I left the country and am now struggling with severe mental illness and barely making ends meet while having to deal with the constant aching pain of having lost my best friend to what still feels like a relationship system defined by 'what you can get out of life'--not on forming a unique, stable, honest, and committed partnership. 

Please help me change my view.

I'm left grappling with deep emotional scars, questioning whether polyamory is inherently flawed or if my experience was an outlier.

I acknowledge that my ex-partner's behaviour was manipulative and abusive, but I'm struggling to reconcile how polyamory could be anything other than a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal. However, I'm open to reconsidering my perspective, as I don't want to let one traumatic experience colour my understanding of an entire relationship dynamic.

I'm seeking insights from the community to challenge my current view. Can anyone provide examples or arguments that showcase healthy and fulfilling polyamorous relationships? How can I separate my ex-partner's toxic behaviour from the broader concept of polyamory? I want to believe that love and honesty can coexist within non-monogamous relationships, but I need help reconciling my pain and trauma.",Ronald-Obvious,1002,357,0.7900000214576721,0.334936730563592,1713625010,/r/changemyview/comments/1c8rxy4/cmv_polyamory_is_just_a_breeding_ground_for/,2024,4,changemyview,2024-04-20 14:56:50
1c3b96y,CMV: San Francisco's proposal allowing shoppers to sue grocery stores if the grocery stores close due to high crime is deeply backwards and dangerous,"Apparently, high crime is pushing businesses in San Francisco to close and instead of trying to address the crime issue, San Francisco lawmakers are trying to pass legislation that would allow shoppers to sue grocers who inconvenience them by closing. Essentially holding them hostage. 

I understand groceries are a necessity (and that should be sufficient motivation for lawmakers to address the issues with crime instead of hand waving people's complaints aside.) but it's also completely understandable that grocers don't want to stay in high crime areas and they can't be forced to. It is San Francisco Lawmakers' responsibility to maintain communities that businesses will want to be a part of and if they are unable to do so then I think that should be grounds for removal.

1byxjde,CMV: Israel is showing extreme callousness towards civilian casualties in their war in Gaza,"5 days ago, [+972 Mag](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/) published an article that focuses on Lavendar AI technology and the IDF approach to civilian casualties. A few other outlets have already reported on this story, so it is likely that the sources have been corroborated and +972 Mag is generally seen as [reliable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/972-magazine/). While most of the focus of the +972 Mag's article is on the AI, there are a few other things that really caught my attention:

>it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians; in the past, the military did not authorize any “collateral damage” during assassinations of low-ranking militants. 

This ratio of 15 to 20 civilians is _absurdly_ high for a low-ranking militant. According to [this article](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/assessing-israel-s-approach-to-proportionality-in-the-conduct-of-hostilities-in-gaza) on proportionality analysis, the US Army generally accepts _ZERO_ for low-ranking militant, anything in the realm of 14 to 15 requires approval from the Secretary of Defense, and for Osama bin Laden the figure is 30. I don't understand how the IDF is permitting its commanders to approve a strike themselves if it kills up to 20 civilians per low-ranking militant.

>they would personally devote only about “20 seconds” to each target before authorizing a bombing — just to make sure the Lavender-marked target is male. This was despite knowing that the system makes what are regarded as “errors” in approximately 10 percent of cases, and is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose connection to militant groups, or no connection at all.

I'm not sure about you, but 10% is a crazy high error rate, because this is additive to the error rate that humans make. This is not some sort of error rate for a sorting machine, this is an error rate of killing people with weaponry. Using this and the information provided above, there's _at least_ a 10% chance that up to 20 civilians will die because of a Lavender error. 

>the commander laments: “We [humans] cannot process so much information. It doesn’t matter how many people you have tasked to produce targets during the war — you still cannot produce enough targets per day.”

This is incredibly dystopian. It feels like the commanders have a target number to hit every day, and because humans aren't capable to hitting that target by ourselves, an AI tool is used to speed up that process, a tool that has very little oversight.

>the Lavender machine sometimes mistakenly flagged individuals who had communication patterns similar to known Hamas or PIJ operatives — including police and civil defense workers, militants’ relatives, residents who happened to have a name and nickname identical to that of an operative, and Gazans who used a device that once belonged to a Hamas operative. 

This is not just a problem that runs deep in Lavender, it runs deep in their training set as well, which means the IDF consistently flag non-Hamas civilians as Hamas members. It puts the number of ""Hamas militant killed"" into question because that figure reported by the IDF must've included a lot of false positives like militants' relatives, nurses, etc.

>We were constantly being pressured: ‘Bring us more targets.’ They really shouted at us. We finished [killing] our targets very quickly.”

This speaks to a more top-down approach and systemic problem to killing Hamas militants. Because of the pressure from higher ups to rake up Hamas death toll, the lower level officials feel pressured to kill without proper oversight or check on intelligence. It feels like someone clocking into work, being demanded to hit some x targets a day, and clock out. There seems to be little consideration for what is the actual threat the targets pose to Israel or IDF. 

>“In the bombing of the commander of the Shuja’iya Battalion, we knew that we would kill over 100 civilians,” 

It's insane to me that a target like Osama bin Laden has an acceptable civilian death ratio of 30, but a commander in Gaza has a ratio of 100. I don't know, this seems very callous to me.


I can go on and on and I can bring up other incidents too like the WCK drone strike, but the point I'm making here is even if the IDF doesn't have a policy to target civilians, they sure as hell ignore civilian casualties in their policy-making. I don't know how this does not amount to a systemic enabling of war crimes. Also, the IDF response (which we have no reason to believe is true) does not deny the claims made by the sources I quoted. They denied some of the interpretations/extrapolations by others, and some of the minor details, but not the central claim of the article or the quotes I put above.",WheatBerryPie,394,856,0.6600000262260437,0.3170001549087267,1712581987,/r/changemyview/comments/1byxjde/cmv_israel_is_showing_extreme_callousness_towards/,2024,4,changemyview,2024-04-08 13:13:07

If I unintentionally get a girl pregnant that I’m not in a relationship with, I have to pay child support for the next 18 years. Yes it’s much harder on the woman since she has to carry the child and breast feed, but my life would get worse as well. 

Polls in the United States would also show that women aren’t that much more likely to be pro choice either. 55% of women identify as pro choice vs. 48% of men. 

Really the debate should be framed as religious vs. non-religious since religious people feel that abortion is evil and killing an innocent life, while non-religious people don’t see it as a life and don’ think the government should interfere what someone does with their body.

A better example of a men vs. women issue would be the gender pay gap.

At various points in history Muslim men have married Christian, Jewish, Confucian and even Hindu women. And were never seen as “less” Muslim for having done it. 

Not so for Muslim women. 

Miss me with the “the religion is inherited from the mother” boloney, there’s no quantifiable, genetic “muslimness” that’s passed down from mother to child. Men and women give the same amount of chromosomes to their kids and the same amount of religion too, which is none. 

There’s no reason a Muslim woman and a Christian man, who worked it out with each other prior to marriage, acknowledged that the children they’d have will be taught the values and tenets of Islam. That way the faith is preserved in the family if that’s so important to her. 

The only logical reason is the insecurity to men’s identities when they see “their Muslim women” with the religious/ethnic “other”",makeyouamommy177,905,307,0.8399999737739563,0.298514756184192,1712610232,/r/changemyview/comments/1bz9dgm/cmv_the_qurans_injunction_against_interfaith/,2024,4,changemyview,2024-04-08 21:03:52

1c5mgu1,CMV: Everyone would be better off if women were the ones who were expected to make the first move.,"Attention from the opposite gender is like water. Men are desperately thirsty for it, while women are drowning in it.   
Most women don't like being approached randomly in public or being confessed to, while I don't know a single man who wouldn't appreciate being approached. The ""men remember compliments for years"" things is true for a reason. 

On top of that, there is also the aspect of safety, and the current societal expectation of men approaching women has resulted in women being seriously hurt or even killed due to rejecting a man. Women basically have to fear for their safety every time a man approaches them. Again, if women were the ones to approach, this wouldn't be an issue. 

If women were expected to approach, they could go out and not worry about guys hitting on her, and men can finally take a break from always having to be the initiator. Everyone wins.

Just because you might see some articles that you don’t like, or you hear something in the news, does not mean that you are actually being targeted in real life.

The video gets viral and they become ig famous because of young teenagers, which is the main audience of these barbers. And these barbers start charging (scamming) 80-100+ dollars for a haircut. They usually get these cuts done under 45 mins as well. As a result, the ego of these barbers is massively inflated too. This ego boost has somehow spread to the average barber and they have started charging 50+ dollars for average cuts at best. So a reasonable adult has no choice but to at least spend 50+ dollars on a simple haircut. Other option is cutting your own hair which is not very viable for many.

Iran gets a lot of street cred on the Arab Main Street for attacking ""the nation of genocide."" It probably also achieves its aim of deterring future direct Israeli attacks on its (non-proxy) interests. It has shored up support for the regime at home and humiliated its biggest rivals, the Gulf Monarchies, who were forced to publicly align themselves with Israel.

On the other hand, Israel's biggest enemy at the moment is not Iran - it is Western public opinion.

It has conclusively demonstrated that its neighbours are now all much  more closely aligned with it than with the Iran bloc. And militarily, what happened was an absolute triumph for the IDF.

X became upset, saying that a refusal to reveal her stance on such a polarizing topic was itself a political statement, and to be neutral is to stand with the oppressors (I am paraphrasing)

1btq872,CMV: Suicide should be a human right. ,"To put it simply: you do not get to choose to be born. If, one day, you wish to see yourself out, that should be your basic, fundamental human right. Instead though, this is not the case, and voicing such things will get you labeled as crazy. Well, isn't what's crazy forcing someone into the world and not ever allowing them to leave on their own terms? Is it not ""cruel and unusual"" to force a dying animal to stay alive just because you dictate it should, and because it would make you personally more happy? It is. So, why is it different for people? 

And I'm not just talking about the terminally ill. It should be every human's basic right to leave an existence they did not choose to be a part of if and when they choose to leave, rather than forcing them to live until old age.

And, what I mean by ""forcing"", is that if you attempt to take your own life and fail, you don't really get any support. You get locked away and have other liberties stripped from you. That and there is no government mandated 100% safe and certain way to end your life. You're forced to take matters into your own hands with a large margin of error. See my aforementioned point on why that's not acceptable.

There should be a mandated, safe, quick way to leave an existence that you did not get to choose to be part of. If you don't get to choose to be born, which you don't, it should at least be your basic right to leave when you want and in a peaceful, safe fashion.

1cdcbrh,CMV: I believe that forced Conscription is akin to slavery and never justified. A society unwilling or unable too generate enough volunteers for its armed forces is not worth defending.,"Conscription is one of the worst infringements on personal life and liberty: First, young people (usually only men, which is a great injustice) are forced to perform forced labor for their government with very little compensation.

People who refuse to perform that forced labor usually are imprisoned for multiple months (if alternative service is available that does not change anything because it is still forced labor and refusing alternative service too usually will mean imprisonment too).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Secondly, it is even worse if that country is at war: Then the infringement upon the rights of the young people is even greater, because now thy are in massive danger to their life. It is also worth noting that conscripts in almost all circumstances very quickly turn into chess figures that is at the government's disposal for their own politics.

The best instances for this are: The Vietnam War (North Vietnam did not attack the U.S. and did not pose a threat - in fact, after they won in 1975 they did not retaliate).

Even Israel's Gaza War, while in principle justified, could be considered to be prolonged by Netanyahu for ulterior motives.

Similarly, the Ukraine-Russia War, while Ukraine is defending itself, their government refuses to even consider accepting giving any territory to Russia, preferring to sacrifice hundreds of thousands young men on the battlefield. The same applies to Russia, which is also willing to send their people into battle as cannon fodder.

Both countries have instituted measures to ban men from leaving the country. Ukraine deployed tens of thousands of soldiers to their borders with Nato countries with orders to shoot anyone trying to leave the country. Hundreds of men have perished trying to escape Ukraine.

This reminds me very sadly of the criminal activities by communist East Germany, which also shot people at the border who tried to escape the country.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In my opinion, these massive infringement upon the rights of individuals bears no justification whatsoever. While I do see the need to ensure national defense, I do not think that if the government, the society as a whole, is not able or willing to institute the necessary measures relying solely on volunteers, then this country and its people are to blame for themselves if they get conquered - because apparently, there were not enough people voluntarily defending it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I would also stress that in modern military technology, there is no real need of conscription because, for example, a strong air force of hundreds of modern fighter jets, as well as drones, plus an army with many tanks, artillery pieces, rocket artillery and similar technology, will beat a large army of men armed with rifles.

The farthest I would be willing to compromise on would be to formally have conscription (for all genders, of course), but if one refuses they will only face a fine, for example $ 1,000, and no other consequences at all. This way, some people who would not join the army on their own iniative, but are not actually opposed to it, would enlist because they formally have that duty. On the other hand, anyone really opposed to conscription would not be held to forced labor nor harshly punished, but basically giving a small contribution to national defense with their money.",dwujd,312,597,0.6200000047683716,0.2300913460164644,1714105491,/r/changemyview/comments/1cdcbrh/cmv_i_believe_that_forced_conscription_is_akin_to/,2024,4,changemyview,2024-04-26 04:24:51

1c8u5zh,CMV: The West could easily equip Ukraine to achieve a full victory reclaiming pre-2014 borders at very little cost. ,"We just need to send actually meaningful numbers of weapons and vehicles. 

If it were up to me the West would send as soon as humanly possible: 

* 90% of our currently existing artillery ammunition (that Ukraine can use), including rockets for HIMARS and ATACMS.

* Plentiful supplies of small arms, heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, shoulder mounted anti tank/anti air missile launchers, mortars, artillery batteries, and ammunition for all of those. 

* A basic given that would be pretty cheap compared to other things is ensuring all Ukrainian infantrymen have top tier western equipment. 

Videos show that in real life some Ukrainian infantrymen still use AK-47s. In America we have 120 civilian owned firearms per 100 people. We can definitely gift each one of them an AR-15 platform rifle with an ACOG scope, suppressor, and underbarrel grip. 500,000 of those $3,000 rifles are only worth $1.5 billion. How has this not already happened? 

Standard American helmets, visors, ceramic plate vests, night vision goggles, boots, etc. Winter gear set as well. Just the videos coming out of all Ukrainian soldiers being decked out like this would boost Ukrainian/western morale and degrade Russian morale once it’s undeniable. 

* 2,000 infantry fighting vehicles. 

A brand new American M2A4 Bradley Fighting Vehicle costs $4.35 million. 2,000 of them is only $8.7 billion. What a tiny cost for such a massive boost. This alone would likely guarantee Ukraine’s victory. That’s not even 4 days of the US military budget. In real life the U.S. has only given 190 Bradleys. 

* 1,000 American/European main battle tanks. 

Why so many tanks? They’ll have lots of functional tanks in reserve so that tanks can be used aggressively. They’ll grow into the large number of tanks as they build more refueling/repair infrastructure and get more tank ammo and as more trained Ukrainian crews come back from America/Europe. The many tanks that survive the war will bolster Ukraine’s post-war defense. With this quantity of hardware they just can’t lose. 

1,000 main battle tanks is nothing for us in the West but everything for Ukraine. 10,300 M1 Abrams tanks and 3,600 Leopard 2 tanks have been built. In real life the US only given 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine and Germany has only given 14 Leopard 2 tanks. What a joke. We’re sitting on massive stockpiles and giving Ukraine next to nothing. 

* 500 F-16 jets and 100 F-22 jets. 

* A plentiful amount of drones. 

* However many basic vehicles like jeeps or supply trucks they need. 

* 200 [M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicles]. 

239 have been built and in 2021 we sold 29 of them to Australia. Australia does not need these giant 40 feet (12 meter) long mine-clearing vehicles. Send them all to Ukraine. Ukraine has very few of them.
 
* All the air defense they need.

But with a focus on using cheaper anti-drone anti air systems weapons against cheap drones and using Patriots on more expensive targets.

Here’s what would happen next: 

* There would be an enormous number of artillery, mortar, cruise missile, HIMARS, and ATACMS strikes against Russian targets both in Ukraine and in Russia. 

* Tens of thousands of Ukrainians would be flown to America/Europe for training on vehicles and in vehicle repair. 

* In the meantime there would be a program for western F-16 and F-22 veterans to fly in Ukraine immediately for $100,000/year tax free. This program would be funded by western governments in direct proportion to their share of total nominal GDP. So right now the jets would be immediately transferred to Ukrainian ownership and Ukrainian airbases. American pilots can leave service to join the mercenary company. All 600 jets would get staffed and would remain so until the Ukrainians are doing training. 

* With air superiority and a proper number of mine-clearing vehicles, Ukrainians would retake occupied territory with massive numbers of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. The positions they attack would be weakened by the massive conventional artillery and rocket artillery barrages sent by Ukraine after receiving 90% of currently existing western artillery ammunition. 

* The West is already rapidly ramping up ammunition for both conventional artillery and rocket artillery systems. 

* Ukraine gets the missiles/drones it needs to destroy the Crimean bridge, and cuts off the Crimean land bridge through a counteroffensive. 

* Crimea is besieged and falls. Massive blow to morale. 

* Ukraine continues its counteroffensive and starts recapturing major symbolic cities like Bakhmut, Mariupol, and Donetsk. 

* Ukraine secures pre-2014 borders and uses their massive numbers of tanks/IFVs to rest assured in their security. 

* Ukraine continues expanding their domestic military industrial base and has mandatory military service like Israel and South Korea. 

* Ukraine joins the EU and NATO. European and American troops stationed in Ukraine. Ukraine rapidly develops economically, unlike Russia and Belarus. 

* Ukraine and the West live happily ever after and pursue their destinies without war with Russia.

1c6swqd,CMV: The Tipping Culture In The US Has Gotten Ridiculous ,"I am going to get a lot of hate for this one but I’m already prepared lol. 

Tipping Culture in the US specifically has gotten way out of hand I mean it’s ridiculous at this point. I am not some stingy individual and I have no problem with giving people tips for their service and time. But nowadays there seems to be a weird vibe that you have to always tip, and if you don’t you are a scumbag or something. 

I grew up learning and understanding the value of tipping for GOOD service, not shitty service. If I go to a car wash and after my car still has visible stains and missed spots, I should not be forced to provide a tip for that service. 

And I know what you are thinking right now no one is forcing me to give anyone a tip. The issue is looks of shame and disgust that people in the service industry will give you, as well as the overall peer pressure of how others perceie you. 

And let’s not get started about when you give someone a tip and they feel like it is too small of an amount. A recent example is I gave my DoorDash driver a $10 tip for a $15 order, and he told me that it was disrespectful because it was not enough to cover his gas for driving to me. 

It’s little instances like this that make me feel the service industry in America have literally lost their minds when it comes to this whole tipping thing.

Background: I am a right winger who supports \#FreePalestine and I support Palestine and Hamas in their war against israel. And I do oppose US funding of Israel. But from my mind, all of the reasons I support Palestine are right wing in nature and all the arguments for israel would be left wing in nature. I understand that some leftists might genuinely be so good hearted that they support Palestine simply because they dont like it when people die. But aside from that I cannot see the left wing case for supporting them.

1cadgf3,CMV: There has never been a good representation of Arab people in American media ,"I am Lebanese-Canadian and I struggled so much as a kid never seeing my Arab culture represented correctly or even just seeing Arab people always play the villains or terrorists in movies and tv shows. Still to this day I think any Arab character I’ve ever seen in popular media has been incredibly inaccurate or racist.  I think people veiw the Arab countries as too much of a controversial subject to put into media as a main character hero or protagonist. Anytime Americans see depictions of Arab culture their brain Immidiatly associates it with war, terrorism, and Islamophobia. No positive depictions of Arab people in popular media is only continuing the anti Arab narrative. When I was in middle school I had people classmates asking me and my siblings if we were a part of ISIS. Positive Arab representation would help squash this racism so fast I feel. I want to have my opinion changed because I would love to see some people say examples of accurate Arab representation that I’ve never seen before. But I have never seen any therefore it’s my opinion. 

Some caviats: 

1. I am specifically talking about popular western media so projects made by the USA/canada/europe not films that were made in Arab countries
 
2. I am not saying I hate the original Alladin but as much as I loved it as a kid it is incredibly flawed and their “representation” is just racist stereotypes. I have a lot of beef with the alladin live action remake because they put no effort into making it actually representative of Arab countries and cultures and characters so I just count that movie as a tasteless cash grab with no actual attempt to do any proper representation.

3. Indian/East Asian films and shows don’t count. I am specifically talking about Arab countries like Lebanon, Iran, Egypt, Morocco for example. I want to give Ms. Marvel kudos for being really good Muslim and Pakistani representation but I can’t count it in this because I’m talking about Arab in particular. 


The closest thing I’ve seen of popular proper Arab representation is Moon Knight. The main charachter isn’t Arab just the setting so I don’t count it. But the Arab music is fire so it gets kudos from me. The work they did to make the setting accurate was enough to make me happy. I want my opinion to be changed because I would LOVEE to see some people put from good Arab representation media in the comments and prove me wrong. In order for it to count, the main character, protagonist, or hero has to be an accurately represented Arab character, preferably in an Arab country or setting. Side characters can also MAYBE change my opinion depending how relevant they are to the media. The whole point is it’s proper representation not just a token Arab character that has zero depth.

1cc3sfq,"CMV: Religions should not be considered ""sacred"" and should be open to ridicule and mockery","Typically it is socially not acceptable to make fun of someone's religion and their religious beliefs. 

Yet all religions are is really a collection of extraordinary (often totally outlandish) claims about the nature of reality, but without the need to back those claims up by scientific evidence. 

So a guy or a group of people make some pretty outlandish claims without presenting any real evidence, typically this involves a higher being (or higher beings), they gather a large following, their followers write down their claims and stories, pass them on throughout the generations .... and an organization is born around those claims and stories .... which we call religion. 

And I'm not even trying to make a case for atheism here. If someone were to simply say "" I think there is likely a higher being for reasons XYZ..."" that's one thing. But religions make some very specific and outlandish claims about who they believe that higher being to be and claim to have direct messages from said higher being, but don't see the need to provide any real evidence. 

Holy books contain stories about how the higher being told its favorite people to destroy cities and even kill babies and mothers, how the higher being wants people to be put to death for working on Saturdays, how the higher being watches everyone but does not like it when gay men have consensual s3x, and the higher being wants women to be obedient. There's special messangers, called prophets who are in direct contact with the higher being, and it has happened some of special those messengers caught a ride on winged horse to heaven. And the higher being likes to really show off sometimes, so it/he/she does things like turn water into wine or help people walk on water. Religions regularly claim totally outlandish things that completely go against everything we know about physics and how reality works. 

I'm not saying one should deliberately pick fights with religious people. But somehow it's the societal standard that when the topic of religion comes up you should be respectful towards someone's beliefs and not point out how ridiculous their beliefs may be.

So if someone told you they're a follower of religion XYZ and told you what they believe in, it would be considered very rude to call them out and tell them you think that their religion is nonsense or immoral. Yet we don't apply the same standards when it comes to other worldviews. For example if I met someone in a pub and they told me they're an anarcho-capitalist, most people wouldn't consider it extremly rude and totally unacceptable if I went like ""no offence but I think anarcho-capitalism is stupid, tell me why you would support that"". Yet if I said the same about Christianity or Islam it would be considered incredibly rude by most people. 

Change my view. Why should it be less socially acceptable to mock and ridicule religion than it is to mock and ridicule other worldviews (e.g. communism, socialism, capitalism etc.)?

1bxh1yb,CMV: The average person in the United States should not trust the police.,"I’m coming from this from an American perspective but this may or may not be true in other countries. I suspect it is similar in many countries.

The view is simple. The police have a specific job and that job has nothing to do with serving the average person. Police work for the government and enforce the government’s laws and prioritize what the government wants them to prioritize. This mostly ends up meaning they protect rich people’s property and persons from poor people because the government primarily serves the interests of rich people.

The average person simply is not a priority for the government/police until they break a law. It has been ruled by the Supreme Court that the police have no obligation to protect you and it is standard procedure for police to lie to you if they think it’ll get them what they want.

To get ahead of the straw man arguments, no I am not saying the average person doesn’t benefit from the police in any way. I’m not saying the police are necessarily out to get you. I’m not saying your cop brother is an untrustworthy person.

1c7fp7w,CMV: Many of the Gulf States that are allied with the United States are as morally reprehensible as Iran,"American and British politicians love to paint Iran as a great evil of the Middle East, as if it's the only bad actor in town, but I think that a lot of the Gulf States like Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar are just as evil as Iran is. Just like Iran, these countries are authoritarian regimes that heavily restrict the freedom of their people. 

Saudi Arabia is a theocratic monarchy, and it's dominant from of Islamic interpretation, Wahhabism, is notably conservative amongst all Islamic interpretations. Women are only allowed to drive in 2017, and today women are still under the male guardianship system despite improvements over the years. In the Yemen Civil War, Saudi Arabia has been criticised for indiscriminate bombings and intentionally worsening the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. When it comes to suppressing dissent, they famously assassinated Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul because he was a known dissident of Saudi Arabia.

Qatar is also a monarchy and it's known for abusing it's foreign workforce and can be constitute modern slavery. The relationship between them and their employers opens them to be victims of human trafficking and forced labour. If we want to criticise the Iran-backed Houthis for modern slavery, let's not forget our goverments-backed Qatar for the same crime. 

You may then point out that at least they don't fund proxies. Well, they do! Saudi funds their proxies in Yemen, previously in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain and Lebanon to contain Iranian influence in the region. Today the UAE is the biggest supporter of RSF, a genocidal militant force in Sudan that is responsible for numerous massacres. 

The point here is American and British governments only call Iran a ""destabilising force"" or an adversary because of their refusal to align with the West, not because of their immoral or evil actions in the Middle East, because if that's the case we won't be aligning ourselves with most of the Gulf States.",WheatBerryPie,438,385,0.7699999809265137,0.2056912162741393,1713476967,/r/changemyview/comments/1c7fp7w/cmv_many_of_the_gulf_states_that_are_allied_with/,2024,4,changemyview,2024-04-18 21:49:27
1c7ibn3,CMV: Housing should not be an investment ,"I don’t believe that it’s good that housing is viewed as an investment. The problems I see from this are that: 

1 - this makes housing artificially more expensive than it should be and leads to homelessness and people spending too much money on rent/mortgage.

2 - housing as investment provides an incentive for home owners to be nimby’s. A class of people is created that now oppose the construction of new housing because this makes their homes less valuable.

3 - it’s a poor place to store wealth. Having wealth tied up in housing isn’t economically productive. Would it be better for the economy if your house cost $50k or 500k? If it was only 50k, you could diversify your wealth. You could buy bonds to help fund companies or the government. You could buy stocks. You could just spend it and put it right into the economy. 

I’m not saying that all housing should cost the same. A 4,000 sq foot apartment in NYC is always going to cost way more than a 700 sq foot apartment in Oklahoma City. But I don’t believe the price of housing (rents or home prices) should be expected to rise faster than inflation. 

How would it be achievable? Simple - build more housing. Tons of it. And most of it should be non-profit housing. This is housing - ideally apartment buildings - that is deed restricted to not increase rent above costs of the building. 

This would be a huge net benefit for society. ",eriksen2398,268,501,0.7400000095367432,0.19458516295245,1713483672,/r/changemyview/comments/1c7ibn3/cmv_housing_should_not_be_an_investment/,2024,4,changemyview,2024-04-18 23:41:12
1cef383,CMV: The police crackdown on campus protests is a gross violation of 1st Amendment rights,"America is a place where anyone has the right to assemble and voice their opinions regardless of how hateful or bigoted they are. Unite the Right rally was a blatantly antisemitic neo-Nazi rally but it was allowed to take place because of 1st Amendment rights. The Jan 6th protests were fine up to the point where the protestors decided to storm the Capitol building and launch an insurrection. However, these campus protests have been cracked down in a manner similar to the Civil Rights Movement back in the 60s. Riot police were deployed before the protests started, peaceful protestors were man handled, some were pushed by the police onto the highway so they would be arrested, some were tasered while handcuffed, it's a violent crack down on peaceful protests.

1bvkyf3,CMV: Smoking (anything) should be banned in public in most cases,"In most European countries and many states in the US, smoking is already banned indoors in most places, restaurants, bars, etc. and even parks in some cases. In my personal experience, despite people saying they wouldn't, these bans have generally worked very well and I think it's quite rare for someone to actually smoke in of these places and get a fine.

Some definitions/clarifications

Smoking - anything, tobacco, marijuana, whatever. Potentially vaping though not sure about that

Public - to keep it simple, public would include everywhere except someone's own house, private property (i.e. car, garden, whatever someone owns). There would be some exceptions like forests or open areas where one can reasonably expect not to meet someone else. It would however include private businesses though, as is the case now with restaurants, bars, clubs in most places I've described. I'd also be open to an exception anywhere if it's very clear that there won't be anyone around you (like 4am in the morning on a street in the suburb).

A lot of times people in CMV tend to focus on very specific things. For example here someone might say ""but how do you define open areas?"" What I'd say is that I'm open to loosening my definition and what I'm only debating here is the basic idea that wherever you have the opportunity to meet a foreign person who doesn't want to/consent to inhaling what you're smoking, you shouldn't be allowed to do so.

Now to get to the reason. I'm not expressing a view on what people want to do in their own homes or with other people who don't mind inhaling smoke. I don't think a ban would be effective or desirable there as clearly it can't be enforced. My idea is that when I walk on a public street, I don't want to inhale second hand tobacco or marijuana, so why should someone be able to ""pollute"" the street like that, by doing something that arguably is bad for them anyway (tobacco at least). Obviously the indoor bans were also controversial and it was easier to justify because there's no open air but even in open air, if there's people smoking on the street it does leave a stench and there's clearly a reason why some parks ban smoking.

1cdrc81,"CMV: we should ban entirely the use of ""your honor"" in reference to judges of any kind in a courtroom","Disclaimer: I'm American and have no idea what customs are in courtrooms elsewhere. 

At the founding of the US, there was some question of what to call the executive, George Washington. 

Some had floated ""your highness"" or ""your grace."" Washington rejected these titles, settling simply on ""Mr. President,"" which at the time had very minimal prestige associated with it (for example, a head of a book club). Happily, this trend has continued. Mr. President has stuck.

How on earth do we call even traffic court judges ""your Honor"", including in second person (""your honor mentioned earlier ________"" instead of ""you mentioned earlier"")? I'm watching the immunity trial and it seems absurd.

Not only is it an inversion of title and authority, it seems like blatant sucking up to someone who will presumably have a lot of power over your life, or your case. 

We don't call bosses your honor, we don't call doctors that save lives your honor, we use the term *only* for people who could either save or ruin our lives, or at a minimum give us slack on parking tickets.

I would propose that a law be passed to ban the term in all courts, federal and state, and henceforth judges should be addressed as ""Judge _______"".

1cwq65v,CMV: it is perfectly reasonable of the ICC prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for leaders of Hamas *and* of Israel for alleged crimes against humanity,"I’m feeling like the world has gone mad in its general reaction to this move by the ICC prosecutor.

We have Biden and others calling it outrageous to suggest equivalence between Israel and Hamas (which it would be) but that’s not at all what the ICC prosecutor has done - he’s just said ‘name’ is suspected of this list of bad things, and ‘name’ is suspected of this other list of bad things, with evidence, and those allegations are serious enough that there is potentially a case to answer. 

I’ve also seen people on Israeli subs saying although they might hate Netanyahu, the ICC has lost the plot. Like: ‘he’s a criminal but obviously not THAT kind of criminal!’, and saying the ICC should turn its attention to the real crims in Russia or North Korea instead. But, jurisdictional issues aside, why would you not want scrutiny of all leaders responsible for massive loss of life? Even the strongest supporter of Israel’s right to defend itself should surely be concerned about how exactly that defending is done? And there are lots of features of Israel’s warfare that should at least prompt cause for concern (disproportionate fatalities, friendly fire, dead aid workers, soldier misconduct)

Meanwhile Hamas says the move equates victim with executioner. Same point applies as above, that leaders on both sides might have some charges in common, but the question in each case is “did this person do this stuff?” NOT “is this person better/worse than that person?” Also I don’t believe there is any doubt that Hamas ordered deliberate killing of civilians and taking of hostages. The whole point of the concept of war crimes is that it doesn’t matter how righteous or justified you feel, or how nasty war is - you should never do them. 

Are we really so addicted to “good guy vs bad guy” narratives that we can’t bend our minds around the concept that maybe two sides, despite all sorts of legitimate grievances, can simultaneously inflict great evils on one another?

Is it perhaps that it’s such a complex situation the moderates stay quiet so the polar extremes dominate the airtime?

Or am I missing something here? I see no sensible reason for calling the ICC’s (very preliminary) move anything other than reasonable, or anything short of exactly what we should want to see in modern civilisation.

1clrqw2,CMV: future of Islamism in Europe is not promising ,"
I'm ex-muslim and I was worried about what's happening in the last few years where people in the UK chanting for implementing Sharia as well as Germany 

I don't have problems with Muslims just if you want to say I'm islamophobic but I don't want my head to be chopped off because I left my faith for the scientific errors in the Quran which is the word of God 

But I truly believe that stoning to death, killing apostates, cutting hands and doing jihad which is militarily fighting other countries to worship allah and enslaving their women and children and kill men if they defend their land and implementing jyzia to humiliate non-muslims is something bad and inhumane and terrorist 

I think that 1 scenario will happen in the future out of 2 

1. The good scenario 

Europe will organize the immigration policy and the next generations of Muslim will be less conservative and many of them will leave the faith and everything is gonna be fine (most of the ones who want sharia are either 1st generation or 2nd at most) a


2. The bad scenario 

UK will face a civil war from people who wants to implement the Sharia (and yes that's what literally in the Quran, Muslims are ordered to jihad) and eventually the UK will win but after many casualties 


Sorry if that's sounds very extreme but I'm genuinely worried because I'll encounter many persecution if people in my country knows that I'm atheist and maybe I'll be killed if they know and I'm willing to go work in the west and I -for obvious reasons- don't want to be killed there too

And I still think the wet noodle spine of most of the party establishment precluded the possibility of them mounting any serious opposition to Trump’s candidacy. But look, Biden is old. People don’t like him. They’re not inspired by him. His voice is weak and thin and his economy is unaffordable.

This is essentially like saying, “human beings are ren’t mammals, they’re primates”.

Yes, the United States is not a *direct democracy* like ancient Athens, but it’s a representative democracy, which is essentially the same thing as a republic. 

And it features pretty well developed press freedoms, an independent judiciary, full equal protection for all citizens under the law, enforcement of property rights, transparency and accountability of government officials, elections of legislators, robust political debates , etc. These are all hallmarks of a democracy.

1cktjcg,"CMV: If Israel is an illegitimate state because it was founded on ethnic cleansing, so is Turkey.","In 1948 Israel won its war of independence as a product of Arab states refusing the UN partition plan of Mandatory Palestine and then proceeding to not make any sort of counter-offer during this period. 700,000 Arabs either fled Mandatory Palestine or were expelled. 

In the Palestinian narrative, this is seen as the ""Nakba"". They conveniently ignore the significantly larger number of Jews who were expelled from Middle Eastern countries immediately after this.

Regardless, let's say that this narrative is entirely correct. That Israel is an illegitimate state because of their acts of ethnic cleansing justified through Jewish nationalism. Then it should also logically follow that Turkey is an entirely illegitimate state.

Turkey emerged from the remnants of the Ottoman Empire after the Turkish War of Independence (1919-1923). The establishment of Turkey happened as the result of significantly worse levels of ethnic cleansing and genocides against ethnic minorities. The most obvious example being the Armenians. 1.5 million of them were systemically exterminated in this war. The ideological justification of this is fundamentally identical to that of the State of Israel, Jewish Nationalism or Zionism. Following the war, the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne created a compulsory population exchange involving 1.2 million ethnic Greeks from Turkey and 500,000 Muslims from Greece.

This was explicitly endorsed and enforced as state policy to create an ethnically homogeneous nation. If Israel had the same intentions, they failed. This is not, and has not been reflected in the ethnic makeup of the State of Israel.

The only *possible* difference between these two circumstances that would make Israel illegitimate and Turkey legitimate, is that many Israelis came from Europe instead of the Middle East. However I fail to see how this is relevant to the actual act of ethnic cleansing and population swaps that makes Israel illegitimate in the first place. 

Out of consistency, all pro-Palestinians who think that Israel is an illegitimate state per the principles of its founding should also apply this standard to the State of Turkey and many other states around the world.

All 'anti-zionists', who want the destruction and/or dissolution of Israel entirely (not just them to stop their actions in the West Bank or Gaza and implement a two-state solution) should also be in favour of the destruction/dissolution of Turkey and right of return for all displaced Greeks (and Muslims) from both countries.  
  
The fact that Turks happened to *also* be in modern-day Turkey for a very long time is irrelevant to the question of whether or not ethnic cleansing (or 'population swaps, as it was called') makes the state that did it illegitimate. Saying that Israel is a 'European Colonial Venture' has nothing to do with the logic presented nor do I particularly care about the recklessness of the British Empire in the dissolution of their mandates.

1cqsuws,"CMV:Islam is evil, and the biggest threat to the West","First. Let’s get this out the way before someone’s chimes in with the “Islamophobic” retort. Criticizing Islam isn’t hateful. Or racist. Arabs are fine. Islam is not. I hold all 3 religions in nearly equal contempt. However the other two are in the 21st century at least. There are a frightening number of radicals worldwide. The religion itself was built on conquest and spread by the sword. Muhammad was a pedophile. And Islam actually got better for awhile. Then I want to say around the 1700s/1800s you started having these different schools of thought. Then you had Sayyid Qutb come along in the early 1900s. He’s basically the father of modern day Islamism. Let me explain two different kinds of people. 

There is a difference between radicals and terrorists. A small minority are terrorists.

15-25% of all muslims are radical in their beliefs, meaning they believe one or a combination of the following:

1.	⁠Being gay should be illegal.
2.	⁠Honor killings are sometimes justified.
3.	⁠Apostates should be killed.
4.	⁠Terrorist attacks against civilian centers is sometimes justified.

Anyone who believes those things is a radical. Regardless if Islam teaches it or some government says it. In this specific case, 15-25% or more muslims believe some of these things. There are polls recently that show close to 90 percent of Gazans support Hamas. A majority supported October 7th. 93 percent of Palestinians oppose homosexuality. Close to 40 percent of young British Muslims believe apostates should be killed. I can go on and on. And that is why I believe Islam evil and a grave threat.

I think I've seen at least ten posts a day about this with the same messages. But I do feel that as someone with barely any personal ties to these conflicts, I feel I just don't really think I can say who is right.

I have several friends who protested and while most of them didn't see too much fighting (their schools mostly just had a two hour rally and everyone left afterwards), the ones who did see battles like at UCLA or Columbia were much more distressed and I did spend some time comforting them as a friend even if I had told them I was more or less neutral, which they understood and had no problem with.

But I think regardless of gender, it’s not an unfair standard to want a partner that hasn’t slept around a ton. A popular sentiment online is that if I found out well into a relationship that my partner had slept with 50 people, any emotional reaction I may have can only be the result of insecurity. 

Is it inherently insecure to not want a person who is willing to let their body be used by numerous strangers? At the very least I think I’m justified in thinking “ew”, and that doesn’t have to be because of my own insecurity.

1cis8r4,CMV: Standing in solidarity with Palestinians does not mean endorsing or supporting everything Palestinians believe in,"When I discuss with people here about Israel/Palestine issues, I will always get accused of supporting Hamas or condoning the Oct 7th attacks because many Palestinians do, but this is a line of reasoning I don't follow. When Nat Turner rebelled and killed more than 50 White people, abolitionists did not stop supporting abolition, in fact he is viewed quite favourably today by African Americans. Or when ANC bombed Church Street which killed 19 people and wounded 200 more, many South African Blacks saw that as justified yet it doesn't mean one should stop opposing the apartheid. Similarly, just because many Palestinians believe that the Oct 7th attacks are justified, it doesn't mean that I think they are justified and, more importantly, that I should stop supporting them in getting their right to self determination.  

The other accusation I get a lot is that I am homophobic to support the Palestinians, which is strange given that I am bisexual myself. Truth be told, when considering all matters in politics, I probably have more in common with the average Israeli than the average Palestinian, but the right to self-determination, the right to safety, and the right to basic necessities are not and should not be conditioned on someone having political beliefs that align with mine. If that is the case then I would not support most self-determination movements in the world because I am solidly on the left on most issues.

I think the converse is true as well, if someone is standing in solidarity with Israelis, I do not immediately assume that they support Bibi or the Israeli settlers (in fact odds are they don't). I am very well aware that someone can simply believe in Israel's right to self-defence without taking Bibi's actual political positions into account.

So I would like to hear why standing in solidarity with the Palestinians necessarily means that I endorse or support political positions that are mainstream amongst Palestinians.",WheatBerryPie,688,1354,0.6700000166893005,0.5237684315780102,1714687498,/r/changemyview/comments/1cis8r4/cmv_standing_in_solidarity_with_palestinians_does/,2024,5,changemyview,2024-05-02 22:04:58

1cz17gg,"CMV: The reason there’s so much loneliness in America today is because we the people have replaced our traditional institutions of community in America with social media and the internet, which are half-measures at best and actively harmful at worst.","
Humans are, in my opinion, naturally lazy creatures who will always choose the path of least resistance in almost anything. This includes communication. Throughout most of human history our sense of community was connected to our ability to travel to meet other people or other peoples ability to travel to us. 

The postal service, mail, letters, tv radio shows and phones all altered the equation but none more fundamentally then the internet did. The internet offered something unique. The *closest* simulation you could get to having a person/people in the room with you while also being alone. It has the trappings of community but none of the soul.

Low investment, low barrier to entry. Those are the hallmarks of social media. Yes it’s monetized in variety of different ways but on the whole it’s accessible and easily available at no cost to almost anyone. But it’s this lack of investment that causes the problem. People feel less satisfied, more lonely and more disconnected because the crutches they’ve fallen back on — again the path of least resistance — are empty calories. They provide no real nutrition, no food for the soul, they can aid people in connecting but they’re a tool. Not a solution in my opinion. 

My nephew is the textbook example of social media’s failed promise. He’s probably on the autism spectrum, he’s naturally shy and as a result has almost no friends in school. But with social media, game chats and YouTube to provide nourishment it should be no problem right? 

Wrong. 

He’s almost graduated high school and god love him, he’s emotionally stunted. Idk how he’s gonna meet a man/woman, how he’ll fall in love, how he’ll build a network of friends, how he’ll even hold down a job if he’s never exercised, never developed, the “muscles” you need to form meaningful, longterm connections with other humans. 

It’s not to say people like that are doomed. They’re not. I’m not on the spectrum but I had many of the same problems as he did in school but I was forced/forced myself to develop a personality and learn how to work and be social outside of a screen. 

But if you’ve got a collection of electronic crutches to fall back on, you and by extension the rest of your society is going to splinter into smaller and smaller, more disconnected tribes that happen to share the same town, city or country.

","Election season is coming up, and my mostly conservative family who can't stop whining about how the 2020 election was stolen are ramping up their ""you need to vote for Trump,"" rhetoric. However, this doesn't make sense. 

If you truly believe that the 2020 election was compromised by the deep state/George Soros/the Democrats/whoever Alex Jones is blaming this week, in favor of Biden, then it doesn't make sense to even bother voting for Trump. 

Typically when I hear this argument, it follows that there are some sort of vague background characters acting under the eyes of the American public, pulling strings to subvert Trump. Why wouldn't this then occur again in 2024? If you truly believe that, then by the logic of your own worldview, Biden is guaranteed to win again, and you're wasting your time by even walking to the ballots on Election Day. 

I think the only way you could convince me otherwise, is by demonstrating that something about the election process has changed fundamentally for this upcoming election, that essentially limits/disables the unseen actors from performing the rigging again. However, I don't think you could reasonably even scrape that point together, because if anything, the circumstances would only be more against Trump for this upcoming election. In the last election, Trump was at the very least in charge of the Executive Branch. Now Biden and Kamala are in charge, meaning that the 'deep state democrats washington elite cabal' or whatever, have EVEN MORE of an upper hand in playing around with the votes. 

If Trump, while president, had the election unfairly taken away from him in 2020, because the elites rigged the election against him, then it stands to reason that the now only stronger elites would do this again, meaning there's literally no reason for anyone to go cast a vote for him.

1csqdpf,CMV: Muting mics during a Biden/Trump debate actually benefits Trump's style of debating.,"Biden and Trump are scheduled to debate ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/15/biden-challenges-trump-to-two-debates-before-election.html)).

A lot of people are praising this as a win generally, but especially for Biden because it will stop Trump from interrupting Biden during his responses. I don't think that's right. In fact, I think muting the mics will benefit Trump much more than Biden.

Muting someone's mic when it's not their turn to respond does *not* stop interruptions, it only stops the audience from hearing it. Consider this: Biden is answering a question posed to him. Meanwhile Trump is talking and rambling over Biden. If Biden gets distracted by this (as any reasonable person would), then this could very easily throw off Biden's response. But to the wider audience who can't hear Trump's interruptions, it will simply look like Biden is stammering, stuttering, or otherwise ""too old"". Especially in an era where sound bites and TikToks drive political perceptions, this could end up looking really bad for Biden.

I realize Biden could also employ this kind of tactic, but it's simply not his debate style. Trump's debate style on the other hand is very suited for this kind of tactic.

There could be ways to mitigate this though. Part of the debate rules could include a requirement that both candidates are visible at all times (like a PIP), or the two can be physically separated (like being televised in different rooms). But I think on its own, the rule to mute mics for the person not responding will mostly benefit Trump in the debates.

1d1h20u,"CMV: Being homeless is a situation that is next to impossible to get out of without financial assistance, and or free room and board for at least a couple of months. This could be from any source. Expecting someone to do it alone is unrealistic. ","Alright, so disclosure, I’m homeless currently. I’ve been homeless for roughly 7 months now. So I have a different perspective on this than probably the majority of people who might see this thread. I also have had the better part of a year to get a closer look at how this really works and what options are available. 

So imagine this scenario: You receive disability income at $900 a month. You do not have a permanent residence. Your disability stipulates that you can earn up to an additional $900/mo before losing benefits. You receive a check on the 3rd of every month for $900. 

Okay, so on the 3rd of, let’s say, June, you check into the cheapest motel you can find. It’s $76/night, or $350/week. No monthly rate. That means a month is $1,400. Already more than you have. The most you can afford is two weeks, for $700. Now you have $200 left. You will need to use this money for food, unless you have EBT. Let’s assume you do, and food is not a cost you have to be concerned with. Your checkout date is June 16th.

Let’s say that on day one you apply at, say, McDonald’s, and they hire you, on day one. And you begin work on the 4th of June. Both of those things are unlikely, but let’s roll with it. 

They have presumably agreed to hire you part time, and keep your monthly pay at under $900. Let’s also assume that you started work at the perfect time in the pay period, and you will be paid in exactly 1 week and 6 days. Also unlikely. You will be paid on June 17th, and will be evicted from the motel the day before you get paid. But you’re tough, you sleep in a park that night and roll with the punches. You get paid $450 before tax, so probably around $400 after taxes, generously. Congratulations, you can now afford another whole 7 days in a motel! 

Unfortunately, you won’t be paid for 14 days, with no reliable or consistent way to bridge that gap. Homeless shelters are frequently full, and rarely near where you need to be to work. They also have strict curfews, and no excuse (even working) will bypass that. You probably also haven’t got phone service, because the entirety of your money is going to your motel. This means you cannot call a shelter before heading to it to see if they have a bed, not that it would matter anyway as they don’t reserve them. So you will waste away your entire day and or night walking around to find a place to stay. 

During this time, you will more than likely be fired, as you have nowhere to sleep, no way to shower, nowhere to put your belongings (whatever they may be) no way to wash your clothes, and ostensibly no food to eat. You will try to show up for work, because you’re not a quitter, but you’re haggard, tired, and smelly, not to mention fatigued from lack of nutrition. 


This is just a taste of the struggle of the cycle of homelessness. You could change my view by demonstrating that my assessment of the situation isn’t accurate, and provide me with evidence.

1citg0m,CMV: The Man vs Bear debate is sexist,"As a backpacker I have literally witnessed multiple times the fact that women gladly pick the man over the bear. Solo women hikers are common on the trail and they never have any issue approaching me in the woods, or basically any other man. However if you tell them you saw a bear up the trail, they will likely stop and want to stick with you. I was hiking with a guy who got a call from a girl saying she saw a bear ahead so she turned around and got off the trail. So we went and made sure the coast was clear for her. When actually confronted with this choice, women will basically always do the exact opposite of what they type into social media. 

The protocol out there for a bear is to calmly back away and not look at it. The protocol when coming across a stranger is to smile and wave. To pretend the two are comparable is downright insane.

Statistically, men that will harm you are an EXTREME minority. There are around 100 million men age 15-64 in the US. There are estimated to be 500k sexual assault related incidents a year with factoring in under reporting issues. That means around 0.5% of men are committing these crimes. That is assuming the distribution is uniform, but it's not. Most of these crimes are coming from the same people over and over. 60% of them are rearrested within 5 years! 14% get arrested again before their trial is even over, More than half of rapists had previous convictions. It would be very safe to say that according to many sources I have looked at, the guys you don't want to come across in the woods make up less than 0.2% of men. Then even if you cross one, there is another percentage chance to calculate on whether they actually do something bad or not.

I am all for spreading the message. The me too movement was an awesome way to do it that opened some eyes to the reality that we do have a big problem. It didn't degrade men. It wasn't rooted in lies and hatred for men. This bear thing on the other hand is just gender war fuel. Look around, do you think it worked? No one they wanted to reach is taking it seriously because people see the nonsense it is made of. I just saw a guy being called a rapist for nothing more than choosing man instead of bear. Also just saw a video where a MAN protecting his family from a bear got clawed and it was clipped out and retitled to try to make bears look like a better choice. You can't get anywhere with a movement based on lies. There are proper ways to bring awareness, but ya'll really shot yourself in the foot on this one. The vast majority of men are with you. But when you make a ridiculous statement like ""men are more dangerous than bears"", you can only push more men away from being allies. You have to decide if the goal is to make things better, or if the goal is to hate on men.",neilthefrobot,116,1280,0.5600000023841858,0.3454514324067035,1714690697,/r/changemyview/comments/1citg0m/cmv_the_man_vs_bear_debate_is_sexist/,2024,5,changemyview,2024-05-02 22:58:17

Many of my peers are studying invasive species and we tend to talk about our shared experiences. However, whenever I address cats (house cats) as an invasive species, I am nearly shunned out of the room. 

This isn't to say I hate cats, I really do love them. But allowing your cat outside, feeding feral cat colonies without TNR efforts, and refusing to spay/neuter your cats is causing immense harm to the environment. My speciality is lizards but many other parts of the world have seen drastic drops native bird, rodent, and amphibian populations as well. 

TLDR: Cats are invasive and are doing just as much, if not more, harm as other invasive species like carp and pythons.

1cmfr1l,CMV: Dropping birth rates isn't an actual problem. ,"I've seen more and more headlines and news outlets in the last year talking about how horrible it is more people aren't having babies. Everything from blaming selfish millennials to focusing on how our economy can't be sustained without more kids. 

I have so many problems with this. But the main is that it's such a waste of time to keep circling around ""we need more babies"" mind set for our economy. 

We have advanced technology, brilliant scientists, more knowledge at our fingertips than ever before. Why are we STILL so reliant on an economic model in which human population MUST grow or society will collapse one day? Really? No one can problem solve some and spearhead some solutions here? 

Not to mention, we can't just grow indefinitely. Truly, we can't. We've already wreaked havoc on the environment and our natural habitats. We're practically an invasive species. 

Less people in the future means less cars driving to pollute the air, less consumerism, less suburban sprawl to ruin beautiful land with strip malls and mcmansions. It'd also mean cheaper homes in better locations. 

Of course, there are issues with having less young people. The older generation needing to be taken care of seems to be the biggest fear I hear echoed, but again, there could be a solution for that. For example, actually PAYING nursing home workers better and providing benefits so more people flock to the field? Maybe we'll need less schools in the future if there are less kids. Funding and resources can be allocated to the elderly. I'm not even saying that's a great idea. I am not a brilliant scientist or someone with political power. But even stupid me can see that there are ways to problem solve some of the issues rather than blaming the younger generations and forcing women to give birth. 

I'm tired of hearing it talked about. Because at the end of the day, it's a mute point. Women have birth control (for now), and we have a sense of self and the right to choose. We aren't the generations of the past who had 10+ kids. And we probably never will be again. We have to move on and focus on new ways to live rather than trying to boom a population growth spurt when it simply will not happen.

The 24-hour format is also the primarily used format internationally, which helps to avoid confusion, especially when across multiple time zones.

1chzwpu,"CMV: Saying that you'd ""rather meet a wild bear in the woods than a random man"" is the same kind of logic that racists and other bigots use.","To say that you would rather meet a bear than a random man in the woods requires that you believe all men are a threat, or at least more so a threat than a wild bear. This is the same kind of logic that racists use to justify their racism, and why they typically believe that the races should be separate because one race poses a danger to the other. Both points of view require a demonization of an entire group of people with a blanket assumption that that group is inherently dangerous. The first is sexist, and the second is racist.

Some counterarguments I've seen so far that I'd like to address:  
**1) Women may have had bad experiences with men, so they will have a (justified) aversion.**  
 \- If someone from Race Y has had bad experiences with Race X, they are not justified in painting all people of Race X as an inherent danger because they have not encountered 99% of the people from Race X. They are basing this fear off of a very small population compared to the overall population most of the time. Even if they've had 100s of bad experiences with men or Race X, to preemptively fear all of them is either sexist or racist. It is more rational and appropriate to assume a man or a person from another race is their own individual person, rather than treating  them as a monolith with a sexist or racist view.

**2) It's not about men in particular, but strangers**  
 \- If that were true, then the meme/saying wouldn't specify men. It would include meeting a random woman.

**3) It's not about all men, it's about random men**  
\- ""I can't be racist, I have a friend from race X."" Again, to fear *all* strangers from a group requires that you believe that group of people has inherently negative qualities, which is racist, sexist, etc, and that encountering them puts you at an increased danger than being with people from another group, or a bear.

**4) Men have power over women in society, so women are justified in feeling this way**  
\- Neo nazis and fascists will often say that Jewish people have all the power in society. This doesn't make it right for them to demonize them. Further, even if it is true that men have power over women, that tells you nothing about the random man front of you. In order to fear every man, you have to believe every man is dangerous or likely dangerous, which is sexist (or racist if we switch 'man' to 'person of race X'

I think the danger of this kind of thinking can easily be seen if you just switch out the subject. ""I'd rather meet a wild bear in the woods instead of a random person from a different race.""

A woman can absolutely feel this way, of course, but I don't think we should act like it's anything other than sexism, just like it'd be racist if this were about race.",Caseated_Omentum,20,1137,0.5099999904632568,0.2835973509208084,1714604004,/r/changemyview/comments/1chzwpu/cmv_saying_that_youd_rather_meet_a_wild_bear_in/,2024,5,changemyview,2024-05-01 22:53:24
1d1y22j,"CMV: If Israel wishes to establish international credibility, it should get third parties to investigate the major incidents that took place in Gaza.","Yesterday it was reported that an airstrike in Rafah has resulted in at least 45 deaths, many of which women and children. There are even pictures of charred and decapitated babies coming out. All the videos we saw are horrific. Bibi has already called it a [""tragic mistake""](https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/netanyahu-acknowledges-tragic-mistake-after-rafah-strike-kills-dozens-of-palestinians/) and the IDF will investigate the incident.

This is not the first time the IDF has had a high-profile incident that warrants investigation. Others include the killing of 7 WCK aid workers, the killing of the 3 Israeli hostages, and the Flour Massacre that killed more than 100 Palestinians. In the case of the 7 WCK aid workers, the investigation was reportedly [""hurried completed""](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/05/israeli-inquiry-blames-wck-aid-killings-on-grave-errors-by-military-personnel) and was unlikely to be [transparent and honest](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/02/israeli-strike-on-jose-andres-aid-group-prompts-new-level-of-us-backlash-00150245).

1cspqkr,CMV:Misandry is deemed acceptable in western society and feminism pushes men towards the toxic manosphere ,"Basically what the title states.

Open and blatant misandry is perfectly acceptable in today's western society. You see women espouse online how they ""hate all men"" and ""want to kill all men"".

If you ask them to replace the word men or man in their sentence with women or woman and ask if they find that statement misogynistic, they say ""it's not the same!"" I have personally watched a woman in person say these things at a party about how she hates all men and wishes they would all just die so society could be better off. Not one of her friends, who are all big time feminist, corrected her or told her she is being sexist, in fact some of them laughed and agreed.

This post is not an incel ""fuck feminism"" take post. I love women and think that they deserve great and equal treatment, however when people who vehemently rep your movement say these things and no one corrects them, it sends a message to young men about your movement and pushes them towards the toxic manosphere influencers.
 
I know there will be comments saying ""but those aren't true feminist"" but they are! These women believe very strongly that they are feminist. They go to rallies, marches, post constantly online about how die hard of a feminist they are, and no one in the movement denounces them or throws them out for corrupting the message. This shows men that the feminist movement is cosigning these misandrist takes and doesn't care for equality of the sexes, thus pushing young men towards the toxic manosphere.",storm1499,0,989,0.5,0.2418092909535452,1715792247,/r/changemyview/comments/1cspqkr/cmvmisandry_is_deemed_acceptable_in_western/,2024,5,changemyview,2024-05-15 16:57:27

1cmax98,CMV: The bear-vs-man hypothesis does raise serious social issues but the argument itself is deeply flawed,"So in a TikTok video that has since gone viral women were asked whether they'd rather be stuck in the woods with a man or a bear. Most women answered that they'd rather be stuck with a bear. Since then the debate has intensified online with many claiming that bears are definitely the safer option for reasons such as that they're more predictable and that bear attacks are very rare compared to murder and rape commited by men. 

First of all I totally acknowledge that there are significant levels of physical and sexual violence perpetrated by men against women. I would argue the fact that men women answered they'd rather be stuck in the woods with a men does show that male violence prepetrated against women is a significant social issue. Many women throughout their lifetime will be the victim of physical or sexual violence commited by a man. So for that reason the hypothetical bear-vs-man scenario does point to very serious and wide-spread social issues. 

On the other hand though there seem to be many people who take the argument at face-value and genuinely believe that women would be safer in the woods with a random bear than with a random man. That argument is deeply flawed and can be easily disproven. 

For example in the US annually around 3 women get killed per 100,000 male population. With 600,000 bears in North-America and around 1 annual fatality bears have a fatality rate of around 0.17 per 100,000 bear population. So bears are roughly 20 times more deadly to women than American men. 

However, I would assume that the average American woman does not spend more than 15 seconds per year in close proximity to a bear. Most women, however, spend more than 1000 hours each year around men. Let's assume for just a moment that men only ever kill women when they are alone with her. And let's say the average woman only spent 40 hours each year alone with a man, which is around 15 minutes per day. That would still make a bear 480 times more likely to kill a woman during an interaction. 

40 hours (144,000 seconds) / 15 seconds (average time I guess a woman spends each year around a bear) = 9600 

9600 / 20 (men have a homicide rate around per 100k population around 20 times that of a bear) = 480    

And this is based on some unrealistic and very very conservative numbers and assumptions. So in reality a bear in the woods is probably more like 10,000+ times more likely to kill a woman than a man would be. 

So in summary, the bear-vs-man sceario does raise very real social issues but the argument cannot be taken on face value, as a random bear in reality is far more dangerous than a random man.

[https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/#:\~:text=Support%20for%20sharia%20as%20the,the%20Palestinian%20territories%20(89%25)](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/#:~:text=Support%20for%20sharia%20as%20the,the%20Palestinian%20territories%20(89%25)).

Why should I care about Muslims then? This doesn't mean I want anything bad to happen to them. I don't support what's being done to innocent Palestinian children, but I also know their parents and relatives would almost 100% want me dead. What it's being done to them, they want to happen to me.

People around me say I should combat islamophobia. They want to me to advocate for Muslim women to be allowed to wear a veil in public spaces, they want me to believe Islam is the religion of peace. My classmates invited us to a mosque, to ""connect"" with that group, why should I go to a place where they want me dead? Why should I care if a mosque is not allowed to be, if Muslim men are not allowed to pray at work, when they want me dead? Why should I denounce islamophobia when Muslims would hand me over to executioners without a care in the world? As long as their physical wellbeing is intact, then I simply do not care

Given we're not close to ending capitalism anytime soon politically, the only thing these people can do to end the exploitation is become the business owners and pass on more or all of the value of their employee's labor to their employees. Because they're not greedy, they could get the best workers because they pay more and thus they'd be able to easily wreck their competitors because they don't have that greed factor. The more people who did this, the better for workers and the working class, as more people would be able to work for a company that wasn't focused on greedily taking as much of their value for themselves as they could, and instead focused on fairly redistributing all the company's gains to the workers who created the value.",BoysenberryLanky6112,278,552,0.6700000166893005,0.2128344736427578,1715630184,/r/changemyview/comments/1cr8qdc/cmv_for_people_with_an_anticapitalist_worldview/,2024,5,changemyview,2024-05-13 19:56:24
1d3jdol,CMV: There is much subtext to the Israel - Hamas war.  But not everybody gets this.   Bad actors ON BOTH SIDES constantly shift between the specific and the general to muddy the waters and make progress difficult,"

I don't think anybody has covered themselves with glory, post 10/7. When Chuck Shumer publicly calls out Benjamin Netanyahu, on the floor of the United States Senate, then it is clear that Israel, under Netanyahus leadership, has gone off the rails. What happened after that? Chuck Shumer was called an 'anti-semite,' and Israel kept barreling down that path.

This is a lot of anger at Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, all of which he has earned, and which he hides behind the Israeli people to avoid, calling any and all criticism of his specific actions just general anti-semitism.

I also think people conflate the Palestinian people with Hamas.  Hamas, ostensibly, is the governing party in the Gaza strip, but Hamas, as an organization, derives from the Muslim brotherhood, is largely funded and fueled by non-Palestinian Arabs who are hiding among and behind the Palestians in Gaza, more than half of whom are under the age of 15.    The October 7 attack was not a legitimate piece of governance, but a specific attack on Israelis and and a continuation of the oppression of the Palestinians.

With specific regard to American protestors I think the fact that this is happening now, when the Shoah fades from living memory, and much history lies between us and World War II, is of interest. I would venture to guess that the majority of people protesting, and most of the younger ones, grew up in a relatively peaceful world with a strong Israeli nation, and don't have the historical context to understand the Jewish state: they may regard it as just another country, acting badly, and protest accordingly. This may, fairly, be regarded as a form of naivete. That is, at least, how I regard it. But there are two, small but vocal groups who have a propensity to hijack the narrative. The first is the amoral pugilist: they just love to fight and will employ whatever dirty tactics necessary to prevail. They will employ anti-semitic tropes to put people off balance and 'stir the pot.' The second is the true anti-semite, who see, in Israels present behavior, an excuse to let their hate flag fly. Both of these groups, I venture to say, take advantage of the naivete of the majority to push their anger and hate and derail any manner of constructive dialogue: call it the Yigal Amir veto, if you will. 

So it is valid criticisms of specific actions, by belligerents, (Netenyahu, et all, and Hamas)  that are then attacked as support for generalities: Pro-Palestianian is equated to Pro-Hamas, and criticisism of specific Israel action is termed generic anti-semitism.  All of this muddies the water and makes resolution of this so much more difficult, which is what the haters, on both sides, want.

1cpdcgp,"CMV: Biden's attempt to appease both sides of the Gaza issue is hurting his electoral chances, he should commit to one side and accept the consequences.","Recently, there have been multiple reports on the divide between Netanyahu and Biden, but they have been conflicting, or at least mixed messages. Here's a report by [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68984999) saying that it is ""reasonable to assess"" that arms supplied by the US have been used in ways ""inconsistent"" with Israel's obligations, but in the same [report](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-administration-says-israel-isnt-violating-us-weapons-terms-rcna151764) it says that it hasn’t verified specific instances that would justify withholding military aid, and the headline used for each outlet is different depending on what the journalist prefer to highlight. Biden has also withheld military supplies and threatened to withhold more, as reported [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68980820), but not enough to actually stop the Rafah invasion from happening. 

To me, this is an attempt by him to appease both the pro-Israel and the pro-Palestine camps within the Democratic party, but I think he's failing at both. Pro-Israel folks will see this as a severe stepback from the unconditional support US has historically provided to Israel, while the Pro-Palestine folks will still see him as complicit in the genocide in Gaza as long as the Rafah invasion goes ahead, and the campus protests are unlikely to die out anytime soon. I think the most disastrous outcome for Biden is neither side doesn't feel like they can vote for him anymore in the election, handing Trump a victory. He should commit to one side, either back Israel unconditionally or withhold significantly more arms sales and aid so that America is no longer complicit in what's happening in Gaza.

1csag26,CMV: There is nothing wrong with female students helping a male teacher unbraid his hair,"If you haven’t seen the news recently JaQ Lee is a teacher that went viral for making a video with his female students helping him unbraid his hair. He only asked his students to help him unbraid his hair because he had a hair appointment after school that day and he wouldn’t be able to unbraid his hair in time if he waited until after school.

Prior to making this video he had already posted many videos of his students. It is very obvious that he loves his job and he loved his students. However recently he was fired for that video. Many people think it is inappropriate for him to have his female students unbraiding his hair even though it is obvious he had no ill intentions against his students. However I have to disagree.

It is a teachers job to build strong bonds with their students. A strong bond between a teacher and their student is the main way for a student to trust their teacher. A student who trusts their teacher is more likely to listen to that teacher when they teacher and is more likely to go to that teacher if they have any issues. It is obvious that this was just another way for him to bond with his students. 

Also it is just hair. People are acting as if the students were putting lotion on his back or cutting his toenails. The students were just helping him unbraid his hair what exactly is the harm behind that.

In the black community many of us don’t have strong male figures in our lives. When a male role model does enter our life we look up to them and admire them. Majority of his students are black. It is very possible that many of his students may not have a male role model in their life and because of the strong bond they have with their teacher they look up to him and admire him. Helping him unbraid his hair is a way for his students to bond with him and show their appreciation for him.

It is very possible that now since this teacher has been fired that the students in that classes grades will drop. They had a lot of trust and respect in Mr.Lee and it will be hard for a new teacher to gain these students trust and respect. The students may not listen in class anymore leading to their grades dropping. A lot of negative things could happen as a result to this school firing an amazing teacher.

1cm7v5h,CMV: There is no valid aviation-safety-related reason for airplane mode in modern airliners,"Airplane mode makes little difference to the navigation or communication capabilities of a modern airliner. First, the bands that a mobile phone tranmit on (800MHz upwards) do not overlap with the coms radio of airliners (100-300MHz for VHF and lower for HF). Second, they largely do not tranmit on the same bands as what’s used for navigation either, and either way ground based navaids are going the way of the dodo, and what’s left that’s commonly used is only ILS systems. One could argue that they may interfere with GPS since they both use GPS, but that’s neither here nor there or else GPS would break down in a slightly more crowded area.  

The simplest way to explain my point would be, if having mobile phones off airplane mode is so dangerous, then terrorists wouldn’t need to go to the trouble of bringing a bomb or some such, they merely need to turn on their $200 phone and that would be enough.  

Finally, to clarify, I am narrowing the scope of this to aviation safety related reasons. I don’t care if your phones might impact cell towers which might just happen to make an emergency call be delayed. And I don’t care if it’s because the law tells you to.  

I’d like to see anyone who can change my view by presenting evidence to support the opposite position.

1cmmqqx,CMV: There is still no genocide occurring in Gaza.,"
This has been a claim repeated since the day of the Oct 7th massacre. This claim that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people of Gaza. and have been attempting genocide for decades now.   


This claim has no sensible basis. I think there are are many ways I could tackle this but by far the strongest arguments against this claim is just in a simple review of the numbers.   


Hamas states the current death toll as around 35000 or roughly about 1.75% of the total population.   
The population of Gaza being 2 million.  
Therefore currently a bit over 98% of Gazans remain alive according to that number.

Now here come the important points.

Firstly Israel has the military capability to nuke Gaza, but more importantly they have enough conventional ordinance to do as much damage as nuke on Gaza would do. In fact they have dropped more than twice the explosive equivalent of the two nukes dropped on Japan.

Note that the combined l death toll of the initial explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was between 60,000 & 80,000

Gaza city specifically has a population of 590,481 and was the most densely populated part of Gaza. It was significantly more densely populated than both the cities in Japan. Currently the refugees in Rafah are just as tightly packed together if not more tightly.

This brings us to 2 points 

It is simply true, that 

1. If Israel wanted to, they could quite literally kill virtually the entire population in a night.

They haven't

It is also simply true, that 

2. the amount of bombs Israel has already dropped has had enough explosion power to kill the majority of the population. 

Yet the vast majority lives, therefore the bombs can not have been intended with a goal of genocide. 

The only logical conclusion from these two points is that they Israel has not attempt to kill as many civilians as they can but have in fact attempted the opposite thus there is no genocide.   


P.S if you’re response to this is some version of 

“so your complaint is not enough Palestinians have died yet” 

Please don’t bother commenting, it is better that you don’t waste everyone’s time.

1d1adl1,cmv: The Electoral College should not be winner takes all for each state,"I've seen, over the years, plenty of arguments about the electoral college. Ranging from it being a hallmark of our country, a cornerstone that if changed would lead to everything falling, to being a cancerous stain upon what could otherwise be a democracy.

  
From where I stand, the biggest problem with the Electoral College is that each state is winner takes all. Look at Florida, for example. It is a state which, for the most part, is 50/50. A nail biter of counting, where nobody knows who will get all of the votes. Entire elections hinge upon such counting. And then other states, which are solidly blue or red....they don't matter. Because everyone knows which party is getting all of the votes. 

  
So, where do I stand? If you get 50% of the votes in a state, then you get 50% of the electoral votes. Odd numbers go to whomever get more. Florida, for example, has 125 electoral votes. In 2020 Trump got 51% of vote, meaning he got all 125 electoral votes. I argue that he should have gotten 63. 

  
By splitting it this way, every state becomes in play. Let's say democrats get 40% of the vote in Texas. Usually that would mean absolutely nothing, but now it means 40% of the electoral votes. The same for Republicans in say, California. This makes every state a battleground state, and every vote matters. Candidates can't ignore the vast majority of the country, and nobody would be able to shrug and say that their vote doesn't matter because of the state they live in. 

  
I honestly can't see any downside to this. But when I posted something similar in a different subreddit, I got downvoted with no replies, and that means that there are different points of views. So, I'm posting this here, as  I am willing to have my view changed on this.

1ctwoqa,CMV: Conservatives aren't generally harder-working than liberals or leftists despite the conventional wisdom.,"In the USA, at least, there's a common assumption that republicans/conservatives don't have time to get worked up about issues of the day because they're too focused on providing for their families and keeping their noses to the grindstone to get into much trouble.

In contrast, liberals and leftists are painted as semi-professionally unemployed lazy young people living off the public dole and finding new things every day to complain about.. 

I think this characterization is wildly inaccurate- that while it might be true that earning more money correlates with voting to protect the institutions that made it possible for you to do so, I don't think earning more money means you worked harder. Seems pretty likely to me that the grunt jobs go to younger people and browner people- two demographics less likely to be conservative- while the middle management and c-suite jobs do less actual work than the people on the ground.

The argument is that committing suicide sounds like they're doing something wrong. Since you commit crimes and historically suicide, or attempts to do so were illegal.

But we don't just use ""commit"" as a crime. It's also just means to pledge, or just carry out. You commit resources. You commit to a relationship. You commit energy.

1cs557z,CMV: Disparity in any system is not automatically evidence of discriminatory practices,"This seems to be a common sentiment for a lot of people and I think it's a projection of their ideology, which is one not of equality, but equity.

For the purposes of this post I use the definition of equity as meaning ""Equal outcomes for all identity groups"". But that is not realistic or rational.

Equity is not natural and for companies/corporations for example, you can't expect the demography of the company to match the demography of the surrounding area, and for larger corporations it's especially unreasonable to expect the corporation as a whole to match the demography of the entire country. I'm talking about America, and in a place like America each state has different demography depending on the state and even the county.

But even so, you can't expect the demography of even a county to match every company in that county. People have different interests and capabilities for any number of reasons and that's normal and okay.

I don't think ironworkers are mostly men because they dedicate energy to discriminating against women. Same with construction workers. Or oil rig workers.

I don't think Kindergarten teachers are mostly women because they dedicate energy to discriminating against men. Same with nurses. Or secretaries.

I think this is just a natural reflection of the biological differences between males and females and our natural tendencies, aptitudes, and personality traits.

This could apply to ethnic groups as well, for any number of reasons. Sometimes those reasons seem arbitrary, and that's okay. But I think usually it's cultural.

In 2006, Joe Biden, remarked that ""you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent"". I guess what he meant is that most people who own gas stations and convenience stores are Indian/Pakistani/etc. I seem to recall he made a similar statement during a political debate.

People bristle at comments like these, saying they're racial stereotypes. But they're true? The statistics back that up.

I hope the anti-AI crowd will forgive me, but I had this funny dialogue with ChatGPT just now. In asking about Biden's remarks, it says:

>This remark was widely criticized as being insensitive and perpetuating stereotypes about Indian-Americans. While the comment was specifically about Indian-Americans, it does touch upon a broader stereotype that certain immigrant groups are heavily represented in the ownership of convenience stores and gas stations.

But then I asked it, ""Which demographic group is dominant when it comes to ownership of convenience stores and gas stations?""

And the answer included:

>""...one prominent group is Indian-Americans, particularly those of Gujarati descent. This demographic has a substantial presence in the convenience store and gas station industry.  
>  
>Other demographic groups, including Arab-Americans, Korean-Americans, and Pakistani-Americans, also have a significant presence in the ownership of convenience stores and gas stations.""

So...reality is insensitive? This stereotype is bad? But the stereotypes are literally true according to the data.

Does this mean that the gas station ownership industry is discriminating against white men? I don't see any reason to think so. Why is it a bad thing that certain ethnic groups dominate the ownership of various businesses? Asian-Americans owning laundromats is another one that comes to mind.

My thought is, who cares? Why is this a bad thing? I just see it as another interesting quirk of living in a multicultural society. There are certain things attributed to various ethnic groups for various reasons and that's just part of the delightful tapestry of a diverse society.

The way I see it, it's okay that we have lopsided representation of various groups in various different fields. There are many different kinds of companies/hobbies/whatever, and they have many different kinds of work cultures, required aptitudes and personality types for the employees, and this results in sometimes unequal representation. And that's okay.

I could expand on the title of this CMV to relate to many other, more ""serious"" topics, but that would make this post much longer and much more complicated.

Anyway, a lot of people seem to disagree with the idea that disparity is not automatically evidence of discrimination. Why is that?

1dh7wsx,CMV: Asians and Whites should not have to score higher on the MCAT to get into medical school,"Here’s the problem:

White applicants matriculate with a mean MCAT score of 512.4. This means, on average, a White applicant to med school needs a 512.4 MCAT score to get accepted.

Asian applicants are even higher, with a mean matriculation score of 514.3. For reference, this is around a 90th percentile MCAT score.

On the other hand, Black applicants matriculate with a mean score of 505.7. This is around a 65th percentile MCAT score. Hispanics are at 506.4.

1dcajfe,"CMV: There is no reason to ever allow ""religious exemptions"" from anything. They shouldn't exist.","The premise here being that, if it's okay for one person to ignore a rule, then it should be okay for everyone regardless of their deeply held convictions about it. And if it's a rule that most people can't break, then simply having a strong spiritual opinion about it shouldn't mean the rule doesn't exist for you.

Examples: Either wearing a hat for a Driver's License is not okay, or it is. Either having a beard hinders your ability to do the job, or it doesn't. Either you can use a space for quiet reflection, or you can't. Either you can't wear a face covering, or you can. Either you can sign off on all wedding licenses, or you can't.

I can see the need for specific religious buildings where you must adhere to their standards privately or not be welcome. But like, for example, a restaurant has a dress code and if your religion says you can't dress like that, then your religion is telling you that you can't have that job. Don't get a job at a butcher if you can't touch meat, etc.


Changing my view: Any example of any reason that any rule should exist for everyone, except for those who have a religious objection to it.

I don't think a lot of people are fond of Biden, including myself, but to believe Trump and Project 2025 will usher in fascism and not vote for the only candidate who has a chance at defeating him is mind blowing. 

It's not as though Trump will stand up for Palestinians. He tried to push through a Muslim ban, declared himself King of the Israeli people, and the organizations behind project 2025 are supportive of Israel. So it's a question of supporting genocide+ fascism or supporting genocide. From every moral standpoint I'm aware of, the moral choice is clear. 

To clarify, this only applies to the people who believe project 2025 will usher in a fascist era. But I'm open to changing my view on that too

1dek023,CMV: People shouldn't vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election because he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election,"Pretty simple opinion here. 

Donald Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. That's not just the Jan 6 riot, it's his efforts to submit fake electors, have legislatures overturn results, have Congress overturn results, have the VP refuse to read the ballots for certain states, and have Governors find fake votes. 

This was bad because the results weren't fraudulent. A House investigation, a Senate investigation, a DOJ investigation, various courts, etc all have examined this extensively and found the results weren't fraudulent.

So Trump effectively tried to overthrow the government. Biden was elected president and he wanted to take the power of the presidency away from Biden, and keep it himself. If he knew the results weren't fraudulent, and he did this, that would make him evil. If he genuinely the results were fraudulent, without any evidence supporting that, that would make him dangerously idiotic. Either way, he shouldn't be allowed to have power back because it is bad for a country to have either an evil or dangerously idiotic leader at the helm.

1dbv1el,CMV: The latest IDF raid to rescue four hostages debunks the “targeted operation” myth,"In the Gaza War, the IDF recently rescued four hostages. The operation was brutal, with Hamas fighters fighting to the death to prevent the hostages from being rescued, and civilians caught in the crossfire. Hundreds of civilians died and Israel was able to rescue four hostages. Assuming the 275 civilian death number is accurate, you get an average of 68.75 Palestinian civilians killed for every Israeli hostage recovered. 

This strongly debunks the myth of the so called “targeted operation war” that many on Reddit call for. Proponents say Israel should not bomb buildings that may contain or conceal terrorist infrastructure, instead launching targeted ground operations to kill Hamas terrorists and recover hostages. This latest raid shows why that just isn’t practical. Assuming the civilian death to hostage recovered ratio remains similar to this operation, over 17,000 Palestinian civilians would be killed in recovering hostages, let alone killing every Hamas fighter. 

Hamas is unabashed in their willingness to hide behind their civilians. No matter what strategy Israel uses in this war, civilians will continue to die. This operation is yet more evidence that the civilian deaths are the fault of Hamas, not Israel, and that a practical alternative strategy that does not involve civilian deaths is impractical.

1ds7o2a,CMV: we should stop using “people of color” when referring to anyone who isn’t “white”.,"I think that the term “person of color” is actually not just unnecessary, but also offensive.

And even though I’m white, it does make my skin crawl whenever I hear it because it’s basically one step away from the 1950’s, calling someone a “colored person”.

When people say “person of color”, they’re basically just saying that “person” by itself means white.

And I also think we should stop saying African-American (or even Asian-American) because they have been in this country for as long as white people have. If we continue saying those terms, we might as well call white people “European-American” and call actual Native Americans just “American”.

People don’t call Dutch or Belgians who have been here since 1870’s “Belgian-American” or “Dutch-American”. So why should we call black people who have been here since the 18th century “African-American” when they are just as American as the rest of us?

1d8511u,"CMV: Marrying someone who is straight, while you yourself are gay and hiding it, makes you a horrible person.","Over the years I've watched or heard, of stories involving gay partners coming out further along in life after marriage. 

If you know you are gay and you commit to a heterosexual relationship without conveying that information to your partner, you are a liar and a genuinely horrible person. Both to yourself and your partner.

I would like to clarify that in this post I am strictly speaking about people that know they are gay BEFORE they commit to marriage. If you find out your sexuality later on in life, that's unfortunate for the other person but not your fault.

The single most important factor in a healthy relationship is trust. Withholding something as significant as, ""not being attracted to your partner"" is the ultimate level of betrayel.

Being born into an anti-LGBTQ+ family is not an exception. You have a moral obligation to not marry someone who is hetero and distance yourself from your family. I know that sounds harsh but that's how I feel.

A really popular show that addressed this was, ""Grace and Frankie"". A Netflix series about two middle aged women finding out their husband's have been together for the majority of their marriages and the fallout afterwards. 

On twitter I saw that people really liked both the gay husband's but I just couldn't bring myself to. When I looked at them I felt anger and frustration that they would do something so backhanded and disrespectful to their partners. In the show they even said they, ""loved them"" but you don't lie to someone you love for 30+.

1dhbumr,"CMV: Small penis jokes deliberately emotionally hurt all people with small penises, not just their intended target.","Whether it’s “small dick energy” or “compensating for something” or “mushroom dick” or any other insult, I genuinely do not believe it is possible to make a small penis joke without deliberately targeting everyone with a small penis at once, even if the intended target is a misogynistic, bullying, egocentric jerk.

Simply put, these jokes imply that having a small penis is a very bad thing. That it automatically makes you a disgusting, sexist, egocentric loser. The people who make these jokes claim people with small penises must all be insecure, but then deliberately use this humour to cause that insecurity and alienate. It’s like hitting someone and then making fun of them for being in pain. They want you to be insecure and then use jokes to highlight that insecurity.

This concept must be foreign to a lot of people because it actually is possible to be a decent human being with a small penis, but these jokes imply otherwise and are designed to make people conflate small penises with being a vile, woman-hating, insecure, vain prick. Those who make them clearly do not care if they emotionally hurt normal people with small penises, and when we call out their body shaming, that’s when they say “See? You’re insecure! Lol you have small dick energy!” We aren’t defending the intended targets of these jokes, we are defending ourselves because we aren’t like the people they are targeting.

Now, the same could be said about any new player entering a league including men like LeBron, however the common notion and argument I hear is that the only haters and people trying to bring Caitlin Clark down are the men, which is hard to believe given that nearly every big name in the nba has had nothing but positivity towards Caitlin Clark.

1dqa0ho,CMV: Democrats should hold an open convention (meaning Biden steps aside) and nominate one of their popular midwestern candidates,"Biden did a bad job tonight because he is too old. It's really that simple. I love the guy and voted for him in 2020 in both the primary and general and I will vote for him again if he is the nominee, but he should not be the nominee.

1ddowi7,CMV: The Hunter Biden Case Has Virtually No Bearing on Biden's Suitability as President,"After reading the New York Times' reporting, there seems to be a  consensus among reporters that this verdict will weigh heavily  against President Biden. I'm sincerely confused as to why that would be the case though because: 

1. Hunter Biden is not running for President.
2. Hunter Biden is a 50-something year-old man who presumably made his own choices. It's not like this was the case of a minor where the parents are ultimately responsible for his behavior. 
3. Hunter Biden does not write the President's policies, domestic or international. His conviction has no bearing on how President Biden will govern, set policy, make his budget, etc.  
4. President Biden has been convicted of nothing, charged with nothing. 
5. Donald Trump is literally a convicted felon. Shouldn't being a felon be worse for a campaign than being related to a felon?

Given those reasons, why is the Hunter Biden case even an issue? Most Americans are related or know someone personally that has a drug problem, and people who are in the midst of their drug issues are generally not known to be the best law-abiding citizens.

1d614o5,"CMV: People are treating mental disorders like they’re zodiac signs or personality tests. It’s dangerous and weird, but it’s the price we pay for lowering the stigma around mental illness.","I have ADD. I was diagnosed as a child and I’ve lived with it for most of my life. My mother has issues with anxiety, depression, and hoarding. My sisters struggle with the former two. None of us, however, *identify* with our illnesses to the extent that we turn it into a personality trait. We’re shaped by it but we are not *it*. This is where I think there’s a problem today. People are becoming tribal around the ideas of mental illness. Autism, ADHD, Bipolar, Anxiety, Tourettes, the more the concepts and language of academic psychology and psychiatry bleed into everyday life, the more people are going to construct their identities around it.

But I don’t think that’s healthy. I’m sure there will be plenty of people who respond to this who will say they’ve found community, connection and understanding through meeting/talking to others who share their illness. But when something as expansive yet also nebulous as mental illness is gets boiled down to 30 second tiktok video, we’re risking over expanding the definitions of illness so that they’re otherwise meaningless. Take a look at r/adhd for example. I’m a member of that group but I don’t frequent it often because the sheer amount of things people attribute to their ADD is ridiculous. People fail to understand the difference between correlation and causation and as a result we get posts like “I don’t like eating cake. DAE struggle with eating cake as an ADHDer??”

That’s a crude parody but it gets my point across. People are associating things to mental illness that are just normal human likes/dislikes. Yes, people don’t like doing laundry or brushing/flossing their teeth. Nobody, unless you love the sensation of floss on gum, enjoys doing chores. That’s why they’re called chores. If they were fun to do we’d call them “fun tasks”. But associating the dislike of chores as something inherent to ADHD is silly but when you take an idea like that, throw it into a lively internet community and combine it with the human desire to understand themselves or find a roadmap to building an identity you begin to the same “trait” adopted by others.

Most “neurodivergent” brains show no major differences from other humans brains. There are no “depression fingerprints” on the brain that allow people to identify a brain that has depression from a brain that doesn’t. The same principle applies to all other mental illnesses. It differs from person to person to person who are in turned shaped by their family, culture, and upbringing. But people want that roadmap so they’ll flatten that wide expanse into a flat binary of “ADHD” and “NON-ADHD”. Take the DSM for example, they tried to eliminate the diagnosis of aspergers and combine it with autism if I remember correctly but when people who’d identified as being “ASPIES” found out, they howled in protest at their erasure.

But, unfortunately, I don’t think there’s anyway to avoid this. The more we talk about something, the more we lower the barrier for entry. The more we lower the barrier, the more people can glom onto it for identity building. Kind of like the kids who, when I was a young, would fake cut marks on themselves to seem edgy and for personality fodder. But now we get it for every mental illness imaginable. To add a final point to this, I think the minute we start making other people’s symptoms iron laws for our own personalities is the minute we begin to limit and create reasons for why we “can’t” do something. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

We constantly talk about how much trauma there is in the world, how easy it is to be traumatized, how sensitive we have to be to other people’s trauma and how trauma trauma trauma can be and now we have high schoolers and middle schoolers claiming they have PTSD at rates combat veterans don’t have. Maybe some of them do, but I don’t think kids in the United States have it harder or that their classmates are any crueler then their grandparents generation before them. Or even my generation now.

My view on gender is that men and women are different, but equal and that they should share positions of power equally. I think the model used by many European Green parties (having two leaders, one male, one female) should be adopted by countries in respect to heads of state and other important departments. 

Ok with that out of the way, on to my main point. If you look at that subreddit on any given day their will be posts celebrating concepts such as “decentralising” men from your life which is described as switching all your service providers (doctor, therapist, electrician) to women, prioritising female friends over male ones, abstaining from any sexual or romantic relationships with men, only hiring women if you are in a position to do so etc. 

Can someone please explain how this is not just the white supremacy of gender theory? They’re using all the same talking points and philosophy that straight up fascists use? 

They regularly advocate for what is essentially a gendered apartheid system and will say that males and male characteristics need to be continually devalued and diminished in society. 

I have never heard any of these ideas said in real life, only on that subreddit which leads me to believe it is a fringe ideology on the edge of acceptable thought and should really be looked at more critically. If you speak to people in real life about gender, the overwhelming majority will agree that cooperation and mutual understanding between genders is essential for society and that increased respect between the genders can only be good for society, and this is the view we should be promoting… surely?!

Also the subreddit operates as a massive echo chamber which is don’t think is healthy, I was banned for trying to discuss the intersectionality of class and gender as from the perspective of a working-class man it seems like a lot of their views come from a position of privilege and do not reflect the realities of working-class relationships, social norms and family dynamics. 

Basically, I’m hoping someone can give me a better understanding on where these viewpoints (which seem extreme and dangerous to me) come from and justify why they are valid so I can be better informed.

1drtg6g,CMV: The worst thing the DNC can do right now is nothing.,"The way I see it, there’s three scenarios, but only two are likely.

The first is what I consider the most likely, it’s the thought that inspired this post, and is by far the worst outcome for the DNC. They wait NC (get it?). Biden’s polling numbers don’t recover enough, and, as November approaches, they realize he isn’t going to win, panic, get Biden to step down, and announce a replacement. With a few weeks or a month or two to campaign, they aren’t able to shake Harris’ deep unpopularity and lose. Or,l they go with a different candidate, don’t get their name out enough because they’re short on time, and they lose.

The second is that they do nothing. It’s the second of the two scenarios that inspired this post. They pretend it didn’t happen, continue as before, and run Biden against Trump in a 2020 rematch. Biden, who wasn’t certain to beat Trump before, at the height of his unpopularity, runs amid his low rating, doubts about his mental ability, calls to step down from his own party, and (at least the perception of) a shaky economy and high prices. He loses.

The third, and the least likely, is the winning scenario. The DNC acts now gets Biden to step down, replaces him with a younger, more virile candidate, and all of trump’s doubtful supporters flock to the younger alternative. With the benefit of three months of vigorous campaigning, they take the win.

There is technically a fourth scenario. The fallout from the debate is minimal, Biden runs normally and defeats Trump. If this was likely, we wouldn’t be hearing calls for him to step aside from his own party and from major media outlets.",Separate_Draft4887,484,1129,0.6600000262260437,0.3904859603906674,1719721951,/r/changemyview/comments/1drtg6g/cmv_the_worst_thing_the_dnc_can_do_right_now_is/,2024,6,changemyview,2024-06-30 04:32:31

I personally support climate action. However, many people around me, especially the older ones, are quite undecided. Every time Just Stop Oil commits an act of vandalism, they become more opposed to the cause because they dislike the activists advocating for it.

I also believe that gatherings and demonstrations are a great way to show discontent to the government. However, I would feel really uncomfortable attending a climate march with groups like Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion, as they escalate the protests and create conflicts with the police. I once experienced this firsthand and felt quite uncomfortable. As a result, I am less likely to participate again. I am sure many others feel the same way.

In my opinion, they also greatly harm the climate movement by pushing other causes under the guise of climate action. For example, by protesting against Israel as an organization, they strongly reinforce the narrative that climate activists do not actually care about the climate but are merely leftists promoting their political goals. This again turns away potential supporters of the cause.

I am also aware of a sexuality being a spectrum, strictly bi/hetero/homosexual isn't very common here and sexuality of everyone should be respected, always.

But the peoblem is the term ""bisexual lesbian"" sounds quite mutually exclusive, lesbians aren't attracted to men, and it can invite creeps, perverts, MGTOW-ers, redpills and incels thinking they can get any woman and girl they want, regardless of of the women's sexuality and their boundaries. Plus, it just confuses the hell out of LGBTQA+ and makes non-LGBTQA+ think the group is chaotic and senseless, the ""lesbian"" part of bisexual is already there, it means you're attracted to two genders  (pansexual is about more genders AFAIK, correct me if I'm qrong please). The term is quite an oxymoron, as if saying you can be a cat and a dog at the same time. As much as I'm trying to make sense of it, I just can't ignore the logical fallacy here.

Personal story for context: Years ago, a family member came out as gay to me and even brought a friend for support to tell me the news. I had never given any indication I cared about this information.

My response was ""Why are you telling me? If you brought home anyone for Thanksgiving and introduced them as your partner, I'd be happy for you. Why are you telling me?""

They didn't know. It wasn't an issue and we are close to this day. But it was a confusing situation.

I understand that the criticism will be ""You're straight so you don't get it."" But the reality is that we all just started dating one day and figuring out what we like. Then we announced our relationship. It never occurred to me as a teen or onward that I would need to tell anyone my sexuality or preferences.

I’m not vegetarian, though I am heavily considering it, but honestly the social aspect is really a hindrance. I’ve seen people say “won’t you just try bacon, chicken, etc..” and it’s so odd to me because by the way people talk about vegans you would think that every vegan they meet (which I’m assuming isn’t many) is coming into their home and night and stealing their animal products.

1dckxpx,"CMV: In the context of American politics, the term “assault weapon” is poorly defined and the proposed “assault weapon bans” will have little to no effect on crime.","The term “assault weapon” does not have a generally agreed upon definition but in practice it seems to refer to anything that looks roughly like an AR-15 or Kalashnikov pattern rifle. It is an occasionally popular position in the Democratic Party to advocate for a ban on these rifles.

There are two problems with this. 1: The term “assault weapon” is so poorly defined it doesn’t ban weapons with virtually identical capabilities to AR-15s and Kalashnikovs, so it’s trivially easy to circumvent. 2: It is a proven fact that rifles are used in only a tiny portion of violent crime, as a matter of fact bare hands are a more common murder weapon than rifles, as are clubs or knives.

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls

So this proposal does not make logical sense. So-called “assault weapons” are not uniquely dangerous, they are not used in a large amount of crime, and the entire category is cosmetically defined.

I anticipate the primary argument in favor of an “assault weapons ban” to be to prevent mass shooting. This is a foolish strategy for preventing mass shootings as a person who is deranged can use almost any modern firearm to similarly deadly effect in the context of a mass shooting.

Recently there was a viral video of a woman who went on a long diatribe on why she doesn’t return shopping carts and implied that society asking parents to do so is unreasonable.

I think she’s being incredibly selfish and privileged. There are lots of parents out there, and if all of them followed her example, parking lots would become *much* more chaotic and dangerous places for cars and pedestrians alike.

Here are my very simple instructions for her: Put your kids in their car seats (or lock them in the car if they aren’t in car seats), pump the A/C if it’s too hot, and then take the 15-20 seconds to return the cart. There will always be edge cases like emergencies, people with special needs and not feeling safe if it’s an isolated parking lot, but to not return a cart as a matter of course is just wrong. If you do just a few seconds of planning it’s not that hard. I know because I do it nearly every day, by myself with two crazy kids in tow.

1d6iy5e,CMV: The only requirement to celebrating pride is being a proud LGBTQ+ person or a straight ally with no other political stances unrelated to lgbtq rights being necessary.,"It's pride month. I am a gay man. I'll see posts and such from friends along the lines of ""You can't celebrate pride if you're not against Israel in their conflict with Gaza. You can't celebrate pride if you don't believe in BLM.""

I personally believe both those things. But I think it's dumb to gatekeep pride with sentiments like that. That you're not allowed to celebrate pride if you're not in lockstep with other political causes. I think that logic is wrong. Here is my reasoning. 

1. You can say it's about ""gay people's protest against oppressor so that means you must be against other forms of people protesting against their oppressors"". But there's plenty of examples of people rising up against their ""oppressors"" that I'm sure most western progressive thinking people wouldn't agree with at all. It's not about standing up against oppressors in general. It's specifically and exclusively about LGBTQ+ people standing up to their oppressors, gaining rights, and creating better lives for themselves, and celebrating how far we've come.
2. I believe it holds up an oppressed minority group up to a higher standard. Simply because a person is gay that means inherently that have more of a responsibility to be support of all other causes of inequality? That's dumb. They should be against other forms of inequality because they're a human being, like anyone else should, that has nothing to do with their sexuality of gender identity. I get you can say it's hypocritical, but that's such a naive way of thinking of it. In a perfect world yes hypocrites wouldn't exist. But anyone of any demographic, oppressed or otherwise, has just as much likelihood to be a bigoted asshole. Telling an lgbtq person they're supposed to have some sort of inherently quality because they are lgbtq is exactly the type of stuff we're fighting against. 

I'm open to having my opinion changed, but frankly it's pretty inconsequential for me because I agree with most of the causes I've seen it being compared to and needing to support. The only one I saw that I was a little iffy on was being against fatphobia. I don't make fun of overweight people, in fact I'm attracted to bearish men, and I think it's great plus size people are getting more media exposure. But I see some probably rage baity things online about what fatphobia is that makes me roll my eyes so idk maybe I am fatphobic? Getting in the weeds there, but the point still stands, I don't think there should be this gatekeeping attitude with pride.

1d7kvdq,"CMV: ""Love the sinner, hate the sin"" is condescending and offensive.","Typically said by Christians to LGBTQ+ people. I think this and other similar sentiments while well meaning are incredibly condescending and queer people are right to be offended by it despite whatever good intentions might lay behind it.

  
I thankfully have never had someone say this to me in real life, my family and friends are very accepting but I hear about this from other queer people a lot and recently I have encountered a lot of YouTube content from Christians expressing basically this idea. What bothers me most is that the speakers in those videos and the commenters either don't realize or won't acknowledge why this would come off as condescending or why LGBTQ+ people would be offended by this.

  
Often this comes along with comparing being gay/queer to being an alcoholic or something like this. They make this comparison to emphasize that you can love someone while condemning their ""life style."" But ultimately this comparison only highlights how offensive this sentiment is. Everyone, even alcoholics, agrees that alcoholism is bad. People who are alcoholics will justify themselves by claiming not to be alcoholics (i.e. ""I can quit anytime I want""). On the other hand gay people don't see what they're doing as bad or unhealthy the way alcoholism is. I think this is why it comes off as condescending, because it assumes that we cannot discern  what is good for ourselves. ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" is condescending because it assumes queer people are ""sinning"" without even knowing it, like we're idiots but you love us anyways or something.

  
I think this is deeply offensive and feel free to call me ""triggered"" or whatever. This is offensive because most of us have struggled to get to a place where we can be happy and healthy. So many of us have tried to force ourselves to be straight/cis only to live miserable and unhealthy lives because of it.

1dmusxt,CMV: Falling birthrates are actually the best news we've seen in decades.,"The world, simply put, does not need more humans. We should be trying to improve life for the people who are already here, and to minimize our negative ecological effects. 

Right now, there is so much human life, in fact, that our society gives it no value; it allows children born in Africa—who might have the talents of Shakespeare or Einstein, but we'll never know—to die of preventable diseases because, contrary to this ruling-class gaslighting narrative of a ""labor shortage"", there is a global labor *overage*, which is why conditions for ordinary people are so atrocious. If we weren't grossly overpopulated, capital would have so little power, relative to labor, that we wouldn't even need a ""revolution"" against capitalism, because jobs would be competing for workers rather than the reverse.

At the same time, we exist under an economic system and at a primitive-enough technological level (still reliant on fossil fuels, for example) that we damage the planet irreparably for every year we exist in this state. If the birthrate drops precipitously and the population declines, we slow down capitalism's damage, giving us a chance of still having some semblance of a livable planet when we move beyond it.

The fertility collapse of educated people is one of workers using the one vote they have to speak out on the system, the prospects it has given then, and the opportunities their children would have if they existed. This movement toward voluntary childlessness isn't some epidemic of antisocial behavior; it is an outbreak of rationality and compassion. If we keep populating, we persist in a state of congestion wherein human life is assigned such a low value, our societies become terrible places to live. If we stop, on the other hand, we give the species a fighting chance. Voluntary depopulation might also be the only nonviolent way to overthrow capitalism and set us up to create something better when it finally collapses.

Don't get me wrong. Some of the reasons why birthrates are dropping are horrendous. Korean work culture and European stagnation and American inopportunity are not good things. Social isolation and involuntary celibacy (which, I suspect, afflicts many women as much as men) are signs of severe rot in our culture, and we should try to fix those problems. Not all contributors to the declining birthrates are good; some of these are serious issues that deserve address.

1dp2whk,CMV: It is more likely that Trump is a criminal than that he is being persecuted,"Trump has been convicted on 34 counts and has several state and federal charges pending. This is after literal decades of accusations of criminal activity in his real estate and casino dealings. Trump himself claims he is being persecuted by political opponents:

>When you look at what's happening, this is a persecution of a political opponent. This was never supposed to happen in America. This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot. So if you can't beat him, you persecute him or you prosecute him.

Trump has a long history of skirting laws and shady behavior. This leads me to believe the current charges have merit, and are not persecution or anything like it. In particular, the documents case seems to be a clear violation of Federal Law.   
  
He famously evaded the draft based on doctors' assessment that he had bone spurs. [This doctor was a podiatrist who rented space from Trump's father. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-vietnam-draft-exemption.html)It has been pointed out that this ailment doesn't seem to have had any effect on Trump's golfing.

He settled with the Department of Justice a 1973 charge that he was [illegally discriminating ](https://www.thedailybeast.com/doj-trumps-early-businesses-blocked-blacks)in apartment rental practices. 

[Trump was charged with violating reporting rules in his attempted takeover of Bally casinos in 1986.](https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/969616/dl)

[Trump was found personally responsible for operating ""Trump University"" without proper licensing.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-nyag-lawsuit-idUSKCN0I52MW20141016/)

In the aggregate, Trump has a lot of close connections to illegal behavior. I expect one argument to be that working with organized crime is just something one has to do as a real estate developer in New York, [but none of the largest developers in New York City ](https://www.nyrealestatetrend.com/new-yorks-top-successful-real-estate-developers/)have had any of these allegations leveled against them. 

This CMV is solely regarding Trump, and whether he is likely to have performed actions that warrant criminal investigation. I don't want to hear about the other guy. 

Things that might change my mind: Compelling evidence that the charges do not merit investigation. Evidence that other prominent New Yorkers were charged with numerous crimes when they were not actively testing the boundaries of the law. Maybe something else that I have not thought of.

1d8ys0n,"CMV: The popular refrain in American politics that ""both sides are equally bad"" is really just a refuge-seeking device for conservatives who are embarrassed by the GOP but plan to vote for them anyway","You hear some variation of this all the time when engaging in political discussion:

- Both sides suck;

- All politicians are crooks and cannot be trusted / I hate all politicians;

- The whole system is broken and needs to go;

- Etc. 

However, I've yet to come across someone who says this and votes liberal / Dem. It's ALWAYS people who vote GOP / conservative saying this. After all, if it were actually true, you'd see more of a 50/50 split among people who say this and the way they actually vote. 

A careful distinction is the word ""equally"" - the premise held by utterers of this phrase is that both sides are THE SAME level of bad; that they're six of one / half dozen of the other. In other words, this would not account for someone saying something like ""yes, the Democrats are far from perfect and have their issues, but their awfulness does not begin to approach the awfulness of the GOP."" In that way, someone is saying ""both parties have their flaws, but they are not *EQUALLY* bad."" 

My theory is this line of reasoning is merely refuge-seeking for the minority of well-adjusted people who recognize that Trump is a uniquely horrible human being, and that many GOP policy positions are reactionary and retrograde, but for whatever reason (the way they were brought up, peer pressure, their financial position, etc.) nevertheless are looking for a way to rationalize and justify their decision to continue voting for Republicans.

1db803z,CMV: There is no need to put LGBTQ flag and symbols over everything,"Let me preface by saying I am not homophobic. I personally have questioned my own sexuality and probably am best fit with the label of bisexual. I have close friends and family members who identify as LGBTQ. However, I kind of have a personal qualms of cities use and implementation of the pride flag. I feel it is greatly overused and placed in locations that may not relevant to the LGBTQ community. It feels like a forceful implementation of pride onto places that otherwise were innocuous or neutral. Like I recently heard that a town near me had a local pier that was painted in rainbow colours repainted. And personally that alone is not a reason to take offense. If the town decides that they don’t want their local pier to suddenly represent a community that may not reflect their own, then so be it! However, the people who want the bridge repainted because of purely homophobic reasons (I hate gay people so I want my pier back) is obviously problematic. But I think in a way plastering the rainbow flag over without any consideration  can actually hinder support for the LGTBQ community. Who wants to be forced to believe something?

1d8308p,CMV: Castle doctrine is a good idea. Stand your ground is not.,"With castle doctrine, the point is that you have a right to defend yourself in your home. It essentially says, well, in the home, we don’t know if you’re lying or telling the truth about an intruder being a threat, so we will give you the benefit of the doubt because it’s your property. Also, this includes the fact that you’re unlikely to be able to retreat safely in your home, so you may be even more justified in using lethal force. 

Stand your ground is essentially castle doctrine but just apply it everywhere. But it is that application of it everywhere that is the exact issue in my book. First off, in public, you don’t have anymore right to be there than the person you believe is attacking you, so you should not be able to be the one who decides if your life is in danger or not. Additionally, it is generally much easier to retreat in public than in your home. 

Another thing is that stand your ground can be easily abused. Someone can just shoot someone and tell the police that the person they shot did x or y. 

Now, if someone does retreat and then has no choice, or is unable to retreat, then yes, deadly force is fine but this is true in all 50 states and doesn’t need a stand your ground law.

It makes sense that you can defend your castle without needing to retreat, but the entire world was never your castle.

1d5rgjl,CMV: Conservatives shouldn't have a problem with Islam and Muslims in their party because they virtually share the same views.,"Ever since 9/11, Conservatives and Republicans in general have waged a constant campaign against both Islam and Muslims as a collective for being supportive of terrorism and every terrible thing in society and that their views are not compatible with society. But I find this ironic because much of their party platform and views are in line with their views.

Both believe in traditional gender roles, traditional marriage, anti-abortion, family values, entrepreneurship, a heavy emphasis on religion in life, and less liberalism. As a matter of fact, many Muslims voted for the Republican presidential candidate during the 2000 election resulting in his win. They voted for him by 70% by the way.

But after 9/11 happened, that support dwindled along with hawkish foreign and domestic policy such as the War in Iraq and Afghanistan affecting them and calling former President Obama as Muslim due to his middle name being Hussein. And there was little-to-no backlash from the party and its supporters. Probably because doing so would be considered woke and politically incorrect. This resulted in them voting Democrat in for the next 20 years in spite of such diametric views because of constant scapegoating from them.

If anything this is an example of why Republicans are the party of Identity Politics and Tribalism. They always like to blame the Left for grouping every single minority group in one box and not allowing them to think for themselves when they are the ones who made them think that way. The same can be said about their views on Blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, and non-Christians in general. Hence, they had no choice but to advocate on each others' behalf due to discrimination from the majority who happen to be White and Christian. Yet all of these groups share the exact same values as they do.

As for Muslims, I'll repeat what I said. It makes no sense why Conservatives and Republicans should demonize Muslims and Islam when they believe in the same thing as they do. In fact, with much of the policy we've seen recently by Republicans in terms of abortion bans, anti-wokeness in terms of promoting LGBTQ content in schools and traditional gender roles and values, they'd be a winner among them. But they only show apathy towards them because doing so would alienate their mostly dumb White Evangelical base, which they view as ""pandering"". And quite honestly, if they do alienate them by courting and promoting Islam and Muslims, it would be better because it'll show that they've been pandered to enough and their holding and privilege in their party is coming to an end. I would like to see that happening. This way I can have the last laugh because their negative reaction will only expose that their party does indeed promote Identity Politics and Tribalism. After all, as I mentioned before, the party is mostly White and Christian with a few token minorities here and there.

1droa6v,"CMV: Human life doesn't begin at conception, but it's ridiculous to say it doesn't start until birth","Firstly, I'm aware most abortions occur early in the pregnancy, and late-term abortions are exceedingly rare. This post isn't focused on the morality or legality of abortion, but rather on when human life does or doesn't begin.

I don't believe that a fetus a week after conception is a human being. I think it's not inaccurate to describe it as a clump of cells. I don't believe human life begins at conception. But I also don't believe human life begins at birth. I'll explain. 

I have a friend who was born 2 months premature. It was uncertain if he would survive, but thankfully he did. Now, if someone had killed him when he was a month old, all people, pro-choice and pro-life, would regard that as the taking of a human life. But why would it be different if he had not been born premature, and instead his mother had opted for an abortion at 8 months of pregnancy?

It seems to me that to say one of these is the taking of a human life and the other is not, you must believe that the process of birth has some magical effect of changing a clump of cells into a human being. To me, this seems like a belief based only on faith, similar to how a pro-life Christian might say human life begins at conception by appealing to Psalm 139:13.

To put it more succinctly - there is no single, definitive moment that a fetus/clump of cells/whatever becomes a human being. Rather, it is a gradual (typically) 9-month-long process transformation.

1divqit,"CMV: If you are not having sex with your husband/wife, you are breaking your commitment to them as much as they are if they decide to cheat","I feel like I’m constantly seeing posts on Reddit from women where they talk about their man cheating on them, but then they also add that prior to the affair, they were only having sex like 4 times a year, essentially having a totally dead bedroom. 

So to me, I’m like yeah…what did you expect? 

My view is that if I marry you or am in a relationship with you, and the relationship operates under the expectation of monogamy, if you aren’t fucking me and maintaining our sexual connection, you’re actually breaking your commitment to ME. If I am supposed to be monogamous to you, but you don’t want to have sex (and won’t consult with a professional to get to the root of the issue or at least TRY anything to be able to fulfill the sexual relationship), you’re essentially holding me sexually hostage because you won’t fuck me, but apparently no one else can. 

I am not trying to justify cheating at all. I just am baffled by people posting on relationship subreddits being like “I can’t believe he cheated when I was never having sex with him!” Because to me, as a young woman, it makes total sense to me. If my partner is not willing to fulfill me sexually within our committed relationship where monogamy is expected, he is failing me in the relationship. He is breaking his commitment before I ever could if I DID decide to cheat.

1dieie1,CMV: If a draft exists and women can vote; they need to register. ,"Recently, it has been spread that all U.S. males, age 18-26, are to be automatically registered for the draft. Truthfully, I never recalled exactly registering (maybe when I got my license), but do have a draft number. It seems completely inappropriate that the U.S. government could impose such a duty upon men exclusively. Women are able to vote as well as hold office. That means that women are able to vote towards representatives who are able to vote for declarations of wars and vote to enforce conscription. There is no reason that women should be exempt from this process, for at least not one that doesn’t remove women’s rights. If women, as a whole, should be considered unable to fulfill the duties required of a drafted person, then they should not be entrusted with the duty of voting and holding office. If you can enlist in the military, you can smoke  cigarette (reference to enlistment age being 18 and smoking age being 21). Similarly, if you can vote for us to go die in war, you can come die alongside us. 

It is clearly discrimination and arguably the most significant issue of discrimination between the sexes. 

Thus, my argument boils down to:

If women are able to vote and hold office, as men are able to vote and hold office, then women must be registered for the draft, as men are obligated to register for the draft.

1d90fx9,CMV: Arabs never criticize other Arab countries. However when it comes to Israel it's the polar opposite.,"First off I'm not posting this to shill an agenda in favor of anyone, I will try to be as apolitical as possible.

As someone who has a North African heritage. Most of my family members hold strong grudges against Israel. But I didn't see any signs of grievance or complaints when other Arab leaders/countries do some sorts of violations. And it's not just my family plenty of Arabs in the Arab world keep their mouth shut when it's another Arab but when it's Israel it's the complete opposite.

Just for context, here's a list of violations and mistreatment Arab countries have done:

\- Al-Assad regime killing his own civilians during the civil war and the casualty count trample the one seen in Gaza. The regime literally used chemical weapons against its own citizens.

\- The Saddam regime in 1). Invading Iran (with the help of the west) in a brutal war where some wild warfare practices were used. 2). Invading Kuwait. 3) Repressing his own citizens and especially Shi'ites and Kurds minorities (Yes I know that Iranians and Kurds in other countries protested Saddam) but the Sunni's in other Arab countries just kept silent.

\- Speaking of Kuwait? How many of you knew that there are actually people indigenous to Kuwait and the government refuse to grant citizenship to. [The bedoon of Kuwait as documented here](https://bit.ly/3yHhhbh). Why don't Arabs protest for their self-determination like they do for Palestinians?

\- The countless Human Rights violations in the Gulf countries starting from the Kafala system (that Qatar rightly abolished after plenty of FOREIGN complaints) to the numerous inequalities women face. I can go on forever here

\- The war in Yemen that caused the biggest massive humanitarian crisis and was instigated by both Saudi Arabia and Iran, again no massive protests was seen in the Arab world to reach a ceasefire.

It seems to me that the only consistent thing here is that when the aggressor is not Arab/Muslim the protests are massively launched, even though Arabs have violated themselves to an arguably greater degree.

Another thing noticed inside the Arab discourse is that the holocaust existence is taken with suspicion and never embraced, same with the Armenian Genocide. Compare this with the war in Gaza where in most mainstream discourse it is referred as an unfettered genocide in Gaza.

Tell me in one instance a sizeable group of Arabs disapproved another Arab country/leader for a particular violation. I'm not talking about government officials, I will change my view if this instance pertained considerable members from society.",holamifuturo,442,337,0.6600000262260437,0.1777273806294085,1717620454,/r/changemyview/comments/1d90fx9/cmv_arabs_never_criticize_other_arab_countries/,2024,6,changemyview,2024-06-05 20:47:34

As such they shouldn't be shamed or anything for voicing this. I think this for the following reasons:

1. It is well known Palestinians by and large are anti LGBT, as such its totally fine to feel uncomfortable promoting such a group at whats meant to be a pride event. After all, said group is against you.

2. It's fine to not want to be associated with another movement you don't fully agree with. Some supporters of Palestine go fairly extreme with outrigt supporting Hamas or spreading outright antisemitism. Its fair for anyone to not want their flag flying alongside another flag they may disagree with itself, or disagree with elements of.

3. It's fine to want pride marches and events to actually focus on Pride. Attaching other social causes to all of them just kinda dilutes the message and energy. Its totally fine for someone to prefer focusing on Pride Flags and the Pride community first and foremost; and thus wanting to avoid the inclusion of other flags.",The_Naked_Buddhist,2683,2259,0.75,0.7803643301654021,1721906626,/r/changemyview/comments/1ebsfmk/cmv_its_totally_valid_for_queer_people_to_feel/,2024,7,changemyview,2024-07-25 11:23:46

How did we get to this point; when the “best” picks are an almost-literally decaying old man, and the man who actually tried to coup the government (do not come at me with your bullshit justifications, trumpers.  Trump led an insurrection on the capital.  This is an objective fact, and you are just fucking wrong if you disagree.). The 2024 election is ridiculous, and shameful to American history.

1dx9e4e,CMV: It is wrong to refuse service to Israeli tourists solely due to their nationality.,"There was a video uploaded to r/PublicFreakout and various other subreddits purportedly showing a restaurant in Vietnam having a confrontation with an Israeli tourist. While I agree his behaviour in the video and the context behind it paints him as being a bad-faith actor, I was somewhat and disturbed by the sentiment shown in the comments.

A lot of people in Israel are against the continuation of the war. In fact, there have been constant protests against Netanyahu and his government for prioritising it over other means of freeing the hostages. It should go without saying that not all citizens supp kj
Itbzl
G  ort the actions of their government. This is true everywhere, whether in Russia, China, or any other dictatorship like Iran or Saudi Arabia. Many of which commit even worse human right abuses and are rightfully condemned. Would it be right to discriminate against a tourist from such a country? No, and even if they are in support of their government tons of tourists with objectionable views are served regularly without any problems.

If the tourist was the aggressor and had incited the confrontation it would be right to refuse service to him. But the comments heavily plied that it would be correct to refuse service to all Israelis. I cannot see this as anything other than discrimination based on nationality. It might not be racist as nationality aren’t races, but it would certainly be wrong. And when criticizing someone for their (geo)political beliefs, one should not extend their criticism to all members of a nationality or religion. “Fuck Israel” is often heard due to the actions of Netanyahu’s government, but “Fuck Gaza” is never said even though the comparably vile Hamas is in control of Gaza.

Now that we've all seen the risks of electing people who are of the age when these serious physical and mental barriers to effectively leading the country, I believe Trump is now under the microscope to prove that he's not too old, and I don't think he'll be able to survive that scrutiny.

But while I understand concerns about the number of people entering the country and whether we have the resources and economy to give them what they need and also provide for our citizens, I've never understood the concern about the people entering. Mexico and the US are very similar in terms of values and attitudes, so while there may be a language barrier it's not as though illegal immigrants coming in from South America and Mexico are going to try to impose their own vastly different set of laws or rules on others or even believe that should happen. 

But when I look at Europe and the migrants entering Europe, that's completely different. Islam does have its own rules and laws and many citizens of these countries believe that these rules and laws were created by God and therefore they automatically transcend any legal system created by mere mortals. 

I'm not saying most Muslims feel this way. Islam has many different sects, with different views. But if even a small % of the migrants coming in- an unknown number I might add- believe that they have the right to impose their way of life on others because it's the word of their God, I completely understand why people would be concerned. 

I'm posting this CMV because I figure that if so many people feel a different way there could very well be something I'm missing or not understanding about this issue. And since I'm on the left where most issues are concerned, I'd rather side with the left on this one as well.

Unfortunately these migrants oftentimes do not respect the local culture and commit crime at all much higher rate than their native European counterparts.

They also tend to come to Europe with little to no marketable skill so they stay relatively poor, form their own enclaves, displacing the native French, Spanish, Italian communities and replace them with dangerous ghettos.  Since they are often stuck in these poor ghettos they do not assimilate to the local cultures even from one generation to the next meaning that all the problems the first generation brought will only be passed down to the second generation.

This only exacerbates the issue which even right now is a complete crisis.

- Election Day should be a federal holiday or moved to a Saturday.

- Failing to cast a ballot, even a blank ballot should result in a fine. This fine can be gotten out of with demonstrating a good reason you could not vote.

- Employers should be required to give anyone working on Election Day a reasonable amount of time off to vote. 

- Optional, but a part of the system that we should copy, even if not mandated by regulation or law. Fundraisers selling sausages at polling places, colloquial called “democracy sausages” a beloved part of the Australian voting culture.

It seems almost criminal to me that it’s not the norm for everyone in the world’s “bastion of democracy” to vote, and that it’s considered a point of concern to query and possibly fine everyone who didn’t cast a ballot.

My central view is that voting should be mandatory, the exact method by which we do this is not important to me, I was merely offering the Australian model as an option. I welcome being convinced why mandatory voting is a bad thing.

Black slavery was part of the culture of the time, and it was not right, and I think we can all agree on that. This is something that silently bothers me so I would like to hear the other side to see if I can understand it. If it's religious I could understand it, even when I'm not religious myself, because from a religious person's perspective, it is the indisputable word of God and cannot be doubted.

The argument I see the most often is that some women choose to wear the hijab, I'm obviously not talking about these cases, please refrain from bringing this up. 

I find the idea that women should cover themselves in restrictive clothing in order to ""protect themselves from lewd gazes and abuse"" ridiculous and kinda like victim blaming, why is the victim forced to forfeit her liberties instead of the abuser learning to not...abuse. And yeah I understand the Quran is also sexist with men, but then again, it doesnt make it right.

""It helps control how sexualized women are, and keeps beauty standards down to earth"" Again, the victim shouldnt change for the abuser's sake, and if the natural standard is men so lustful they can't see a woman's hair, I prefer sexualizing women.

""It's like women being required to wear a bra"" It totally isn't. Women, at least currently, \*choose\* to wear a bra for comfort, and sometimes even to make their breasts look better. And wearing a bra is not mandatory.

""It's the same as having to cover your genitals in public"" No, there is a biological imperative, mating instincts, that makes us specially attracted to genitals, also our primary genitals are not only for reproducing but also for excreting, so it's also considered unhygienic. And it can be disruptive.

""You just think that way because of traditional western values"" Yes, yes I do. I don't agree with with everything in traditional western values, but generally I do, and that does not, in any way, affect the validity of an argument, I stand by what I believe because I see logic in it, not because the TV or my parents told me to.

1dufxg2,"CMV: The Jan. 6 riot/insurrection at the US Capitol was absolutely a riot and an insurrection; the people partaking in it were absolutely seeking to overthrow the US government, and Trump's failure to send in the troops immediately makes him culpable.","The closest I've ever seen anyone come to making a point in defense of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol was the fact that it wasn't actually an insurrection, just a rowdy demonstration that got a little out of hand. To support this already stretched-as-hell argument, they point out that the vast majority of insurrectionists never did anything truly insurrection-worthy once they made it into the Capitol, but most of them just walked around aimlessly. One guy from Arkansas propped his feet up on Nancy Pelosi's desk. So on and so forth. But nothing even remotely resembling an ""insurrection."" 

But here's the thing: That doesn't actually matter what they physically did. What matters is that those people were INTENDING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT by stopping the certification of the election in favor of Biden and forcing Congress to certify the election in favor of Trump!

Sure, they may not have moved and acted with military-like discipline and cohesion. They may not have carried assault rifles and hid behind cover like actual soldiers. But all that proves is that the insurrectionists (and yes, I will call them insurrectionists) were *incompetent* at what they were trying to do. But that still doesn't detract from the fact that the vast majority of them were, indeed, trying to overthrow the government. They may have been as incompetent as the Wet Bandits, but I think we can all agree that the Wet Bandits' bumblingness didn't make them any less guilty of their crimes when they ultimately got caught at the end of the movie. 

Whereas apologists look at the footage of insurrectionists wandering aimlessly around the lobby like tourists and see them just being a wee bit disorderly, what I see is them running around like chickens with their heads cut off, trying to find something to do in furtherance of their goals. They were likely all thinking to themselves ""ok ... I'm inside the Capitol, so ... umm ... what do I do now?!"" Their end goal was still the overthrow of the government; they just didn't have a solid plan on how to make that happen. Again, that doesn't make them ""not insurrectionists."" That just makes them bumbling idiots. Big difference. 

Then, we have Trump himself. Yes, I'm aware the Supreme Court just declared he's above the law. But as far as my vote this November is concerned, I don't give a shit. The man stood back and allowed the rioters to do their thing for HOURS before finally enough pressure was put on him to send in the troops to stop it. 

And yes, I'm aware that he was never indicted for that part. No immunity necessary, he just never technically committed a crime when he failed to send in the troops immediately. DeShaney v. Winnebago County clearly says that ""failure to enforce"" isn't a crime in and of itself. 

But again, as far as my vote this November is concerned, I'd like you to take one guess as to exactly how many fucks I give about that legal technicality. 

Trump insisted that it was Antifa, not his boys, who were actually the ones doing the right. First of all, I don't give a shit, and second, even if that were true, that only gives Trump LESS excuse, not more, for why he didn't send in the troops immediately. If they weren't his boys, then what was his incentive to let them do their thing?!

Michelle Obama (obviously) carries the Obama name, and Barack is still a relatively popular president, especially compared to either Trump or Biden. 

Betting site polymarket gives Michelle a 5% chance to be the Democratic nominee, and a 4% chance to win the presidency, meaning betting markets likewise believe that she likely won't be president only because she doesn't want to run, not because she couldn't win. Even Ben Shapiro has said she should run and is the democrats best chance to win. 

My cmv is as follows- if Michelle Obama decided to run, and Biden endorsed her, she would have very strong (probably around 80%) odds of winning, as per betting markets. You can add on that I believe that no one else has higher odds of winning than she does.

When I flip between cable news networks it’s like each side is living in a completely different universe. That’s only possible because of the content that is pushed out to people on social media. If you’re Republican you’re fed stuff that agrees with Republicans. If you’re Democrat it’s the opposite. Neither side gets a balanced view of the issues anymore. Social media is literally tearing America apart into two opposing camps and soon there won’t be an America left as we know it at the rate things are going.

1e11r9e,cmv: islam is the most political and furthest away religion from universal truth,"i think that all religions offer fragments of truth, that when pieced together eclectically and viewed figuratively, with an open mind can answer questions like where do we come from, why we're here etc. i know that all religions can serve political agendas but i feel like islam was specifically designed for that and it seems to be the furthest away from the same universal truth that each other religion tried to convey in its way, according to its historical and societal context.

islam positions itself as a correction to all these previous religions and harbors a historical and doctrinal insistence on its absolute truth and finality, which results in a heightened display of agression, defensiveness and self entitlement among many muslims. 

this manifests in a resistance to criticism and further insistence on the primacy of islam even when its principles clash with modern values or other people's beliefs (i noted that many muslims are not respectful towards other people's beliefs, and if they are it tends to be a feigned respect) 

in contrast, i feel like other religions tend to follow the same developmental trajectory and have a certain complementarity to them that allows for flexible interpretation. but islam's distinct approach resists such integration aiming instead to establish its supremacy.

this intrinsic defensiveness leads to intra-community conflicts, and muslims tend to monitor each other's behavior as well (im thinking of the 100 monkeys experiment) which brings me to my next point which is that islam incorporates values that can be seen as mechanisms of control. like the strong emphasis on obedience to parents (which we know can be harmful), the punitive measures for apostasy and blasphemy and the authority of religious leaders and scholars (literally every king of a muslim monarchy claims descendance from the prophet even when it doesn't make sense from an ethnical pov, im from a country like that and i can assure you that it works in maintaining the status quo) and their interpretations are accepted without question, stifling critical thinking and personal interpretation. 

i feel like islam encourages adherence through fear and hate. like i as a child, at school or at home i would get told a lot of scary stories to justify what should and shouldn't be done, and i always lived in anxiety bc i interpreted stuff literally, that was probably due to my autism. but i digress. 

anyways change my view.

1edo50c,CMV: stigma against the childless needs to end,"As a man in my early 20s, my friends and I are regularly bombarded by comments from family like “you need to find someone to have kids with soon”; “you need to have kids when you’re young”; “you will regret not having kids”; “only losers don’t have kids” and so on.

That’s just family right? We learn to live with it. But when Trump’s permanently-grumpy running mate called childless women “cat ladies” , I thought: this type of behaviour needs to stop.

I don’t have anything against having children. If that’s part of your journey in life, then I wish you well. Maybe it brings you immense fulfillment in life, and if so, I’m happy for you.

However, in my personal observation, many more people are less happy than when they were childless. And many more people regret having children than not having children.

So a lot of people, especially my age, are realizing that beyond economic limitations, we just aren’t interested in having children because we’d be less happy if we did. I, for one, would much rather be hiking or biking on my own than changing diapers or watching little league games.

And I don’t see anything wrong with doing what maximizes my happiness if it doesn’t harm anyone else.

So if you’re someone who thinks there’s something so unethical or immoral about this opinion or lifestyle that people should be called “cat ladies” for having them, I’m happy to discuss.",honeyetsweet,543,1043,0.6299999952316284,0.2730249882447111,1722107740,/r/changemyview/comments/1edo50c/cmv_stigma_against_the_childless_needs_to_end/,2024,7,changemyview,2024-07-27 19:15:40

""what is the meaning to life"" ""where did everything come from"" ""what happens to us after death"". But just because we make up these answers doesn't mean they has any truth behind them; they just serve as a placeholder until we can find the answers.

In this sense there very well may be a god, but in my view, this ""god"" serves merely as a placeholder for the questions we can't answer yet, and there's absolutely no evidence to support the assertion that this """"god"""" is the same one represented in the Bible, Quran, or Torah (or any other religion, mind you, these three are just the main ones I was taught about in school - the ""big three"" as it were)

1e5q70i,"CMV: Jack Black handled Kyle Gass' comment appropriately and it's silly to call anything regarding the events ""cancel culture"".","Quick context for anyone unaware: Tenacious D is the satirical duo of Jack Black and Kyle Gass.  Black is the more prominent of the members.  A few days ago, during a ""make a wish"" segment at a concert, Gass said his wish was something to the effect of ""that the shooter doesn't miss next time"".

Black went on to cancel the rest of the tour, also stating that future creative plans are now on hold.  Gass issued an apology - not a ""sorry if you were offended"" type, but an outright ""what I said was wrong"" kind.  He knew what he said was inexcusable.  

I do not understand peoples' reaction to this.

*""Oh, so now they're holding satirical comedians to a higher standard that political candidates!""*  Huh?  Who's ""they""?  Black is an outspoken liberal, so he's never been supportive of Trump and similar people.  He's holding his bandmate to the same standards he's held others to, including politicians.  

*""This must be that cancel culture that Republicans 'don't believe in'!""*  Again, huh?  Jack Black himself is the one who pulled the plug.  The promoter didn't cancel the tour.  The venues weren't canceling shows.  The leader of the freaking band made the decision.  

*""What a way to treat your friend.""*  Still confused here.  Ever since 2016, people on my side of the political spectrum (left-leaning) have been quite vocal about the notion that you can, and should, disavow your own freaking family if they say outrageously toxic things.  These people are now the ones saying that Black should just laugh off an utterly inappropriate comment about the nearly successful assassination of a former president / current candidate?  

I don't get how this is cancel culture.  I don't get how someone has been betrayed.  I don't get how this was anything but the right decision by Black.  Change my view on any of this.

1e8hzgg,CMV: You CAN be racist to white people,"Why is there such an insane double standard when it comes to white people and non-white people on the subject on racism?

Why is a black or asian or latino, etc. person able to call a white person a racial slur without anyone batting an eye? But when a white person does the same, it's suddenly not ok? Why is that?

A racial slur is a derogatory term used against members of a culture, nationality or ethnicity. The N-word is a derogatory term used against black people. Cracker is a derogatory term used against white people.

Why is it ok to use one, but not the other? Why because of the colour of my skin is it ok for someone to say haneous things to me and make me suffer through it without being able to call it out because ""you can't be racist to white people"" or some other unjust reason?

Racism is discrimination against members of a culture, nationality or ethnicity. If you discriminate against any culture, nationality or ethnicity then you are racist. It doesn't matter what country, ethnicity or community you belong to, it is racist to discriminate based on those factors. You can be racist to anyone.

One argument I have heard many times is that white people can't experience racism because they ""systemically oppress"" other ethnic groups. Ok. Here's a hypothetical:

Let's say that tomorrow we are all transported back to the time where we were cavemen. No society, not system, no government. Nothing.

If a white person calls an Asian person a slur, is that racist? Yes it is because that falls under the definition of discrimination.

If an Asian person calls a white person a slur, is that racist? Yes it is because that also falls under the definition of discrimination. There is no ""systemic oppression"" excuse now. It's the stone age. No society, nothing like that. Just basic human emotions and conflicts.

It is racist to call a white person a slur the same way it is racist to call a black, Asian, Latino, etc. person a slur. And yet white people are forced to endure being called these things and not being able to call out the unfair and unjust treatment we are subject to.

I am so sick and tired of seeing the media pushing this false narrative that it's ok to hate white people. But if a white person said it's ok to hate any other race, they would be harassed to no end. It is really demoralising to see how we've just thrown basic human nature and common sense out of the window because it's a competition of who suffers more.",Calseeyummm,487,989,0.6899999976158142,0.2553913648654377,1721551957,/r/changemyview/comments/1e8hzgg/cmv_you_can_be_racist_to_white_people/,2024,7,changemyview,2024-07-21 08:52:37

1e0zbhu,CMV: DNA tests for paternity should be required to put a father on a child’s birth certificate. ,"For starters, I believe the requirement of DNA testing for men to be on a birth certificate is necessary to protect all parties involved; mothers, fathers, children. 

The idea of men getting a DNA test for paternity can be tricky subject for lots of potential fathers. For obvious reasons, many women could take the idea of a man asking for a DNA  paternity test as a slap in the face because it can be viewed as an accusation of infertility. I fully understand why a faithful partner might feel this way and think it’s a fair view. 

Unfortunately, there are other women that use the first scenario as a way to emotionally manipulate men into NOT getting paternity tests when they know that there is a chance the person they want to be the father is not. This can result in horrible outcomes such as emotional devastation, financial loss, and embarrassment for men as well as alienation, resentment, and the destruction of the family for children. All of these situations could be avoided with DNA testing requirements. 

To cover the costs of such testing, there are several options. 

1. Fathers with financial means pay out of pocket or through insurance. 

2. Fathers without financial means could request government assistance.

3. Fathers that try to use this to avoid taking responsibility could be court ordered and charged/fined to cover the costs (only if they are the father). 

Obviously, there are situations where a man is willing to take responsibility for a child that is not their own. For these situations, the option to adopt exists. 

Bottom line, FNA is a small price to pay in the big picture of raising a child. It makes far more sense to spend a few hundred dollars up front for a DNA test as opposed to paying the emotional and financial costs that could arise years down the road.

I’m sure some people think this is a crazy take. Tell me why I’m all wrong.

But I think a lot of people have just jumped on the bandwagon and started yelling about it without ever knowing what they really are standing for. 

Most people chanting ""From the river to the sea"" or other phrases like this do not even know the meaning of what they are saying. Not to mention that these statements are usually inflammatory coming out of these people's mouths. People scream these at protests but refuse to acknowledge any other point of view as having a sliver of validity, because a different opinion just equals wrong here. All this does is create more hate between the two sides when both sides can't talk about it without being accused of any number of hateful words. If on average more people were tolerant of people with different views on this subject, and tried to educate, the divide in countries beside Israel/Palestine wouldn't be nearly so bad.

Most people on both sides also don't hope for the possibility of a cease-fire. They want the eradication of a state, one way or another. This has become a war of hate, both in those countries and in others.

1dt030v,CMV: There's no way to punish being homeless without perpetuating a cycle of poverty that causes homelessness.,"I've been talking with a lot of friends and community members about the subject of homelessness in my area, and have heard arguments about coming down harder on homeless encampments - especially since [the recent Supreme Court ruling on the subject](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/28/nx-s1-4992010/supreme-court-homeless-punish-sleeping-encampments). And despite the entirely separate humanitarian argument to be made, I've been stuck on the thought of: **does punishing homeless people even DO anything?**

I recognize the standard, evidence-supported Criminal Justice theory that tying fines or jail time to a crime is effective at deterring people from committing that crime - either by the threat of punishment alone, or by prescribing a behavioral adjustment associated with a particular act. However, for vulnerable populations with little or nothing left to lose, I question whether that theory still holds up.

* Impose a fine, and you'll have a hard time collecting. Even if you're successful, you're reducing a homeless person's savings that could be used for getting out of the economic conditions that make criminal acts more likely.

* Tear down their encampment, and they'll simply relocate elsewhere, probably with less than 100% of the resources they initially had, and to an area that's more out of the way, and with access to fewer public resources.

* Jail them, and it not only kicks the can down the road (in a very expensive way), but it makes things more challenging for them to eventually find employment.

1dukx9u,CMV: Universal Income is a great idea.,"I believe that Universal Income would be a great thing for society. 

Everyone gets a set amount of money each month from the government. 

Not a massive amount. Just enough for people to be able to be fed and sheltered. 

I suppose it would be best to work it out differently for people based on their living situation.

So a single person living alone would get more money than a person living with a partner, as it has to cover their rent. 

So just to throw numbers out for an example... maybe £/$500 each a month for the couple and £/$1000 for the single person. So the household income amounts to the same. 

There would of course be a few different scenarios of course, like if they have kids, how many kids they have etc. 

But the basic idea is that we make it so everyone can just about survive on the money they’re given. 

Most people would want more than the bare minimum. So they can go out and get a job and use the extra money they’re making to pay for life’s luxuries. 

This would also encourage people to take risks in starting a company, developing a new product for instance. So it should lead to innovation as people know if it all goes tits up, they won’t lose their house. 

And of course the money given out is going back into society either by spending on products or services, or by creating a company and then paying staff who will spend their money in society. 

It’s really on the very rich people who hoard money. For everyone else, money just goes round in circles, so it’s not a case of just giving money to people and it just being a big cost for the government, because that money keeps circulating. 

So yeah.. CMV.

1dw7szc,CMV: Imprisoning CEOs of companies that hire illegal immigrants would effectively end most illegal immigration. The fact that any policy like this hasn't been proposed is proof that neither American party wants to actually address the issue. ,"Here is how you end illegal immigration in the US. 

You don't build walls. You don't increase border security funding. 

You curb people's desire to come here. 

Why do they come here? Despite being illegal, thousands upon thousands of American businesses hire illegal labor and pay them cash under the table. 


ICE could be converted into a Labor Auditing department (we may already have one but since it's obviously not effective, I'll refer to making a new one) that is funded effectively and whose goal is to audit all business employees to make sure they are legal. Not only will NEW-ICE conduct audits, they can conduct undercover operations on large organizations to find out if they are hiring illegals. 

If a business is found to be employing illegal labor, the hiring managers and CEOs could face 2-3 years in prison. This will encourage business leadership to heavily audit themselves and ensure that when NEW-ICE comes investigating, their books are clean. 

It wouldn't address the illegals that already live here. But when these people can't find work anymore, word will spread and they will stop wasting their time crossing into a country where businesses are too scared of imprisonment to hire them.

Thats my proposal. 

Here's the thing, I don't want you to CMV on why that proposal is a bad idea. 

I know it's a bad idea. It's a great solution for solving the issue Trump brought up after every question during the debate. (migrants flooding in). 

People truly don't understand how ingrained illegal labor is in our society. Do you know how much of the food you get from grocery stores has been handled and processed by illegal labor? It's one of the reasons prices are so low. 

People would freak out if produce prices doubled over even tripled because companies have to pay higher wages to American or legal work visa owners to harvest their produce. 

Both parties know that actually fixing illegal immigration would be a disaster for their reelection chances. As we've seen, rising food prices, gas prices, and inflation are most people's top priority politically. 

Is it right that companies exploit cheap labor? No. But since when has the American voter cared about morals? In our individualistic society, we care far more about our bottom lines than ethics and working conditions for non Americans. 

Nobody wants to fix illegal immigrants coming in because we need them to sustain our 1st world lifestyles. 

And yet, we fight over it and catasrophize it because most people are dumb, uneducated, and do not understand the complexities around it. 

Which is why you shouldn't vote for either party based on their border policies. Look at other policies they propose because they are straight up lying to you about the nature of immigration in this country.

1e5u7gm,CMV: Trumps' intended economic policies will be hugely inflationary.,"A common refrain on the right is that Trump is some sort of inflation hawk, and that he is uniquely equipped to fix Biden's apparent mismanagement of the economy.

The salient parts of his policy plan ([Agenda47 ](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/reclaiming-americas-independence-by-slashing-bidens-disastrous-trade-deficits)and public comments he's made) are:

* implementation of some kind of universal tariff (10%?)
* implementation of selectively more aggressive tariffs on Chinese goods (to \~60% in some cases?)
* targeted reduction in trade with China specifically
* a [broader desire](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-vance-us-dollar.html) to weaken the U.S. dollar to support U.S. exports
* a [mass program](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/trump-immigration-republicans-explained.html) of deportation
* at least maintaining individual tax cuts

Whether or not any of these things are important or necessary per se, all of them are inflationary:

* A universal tariff is effectively a 10% tax on imported goods. Whether or not those tariffs will be a boon do domestic industry isn't clear.
* Targeted Chinese tariffs are equally a tax, and eliminating trade with them means getting our stuff from somewhere else - almost certainly at a higher rate.
* His desire for a weaker dollar is just an attitudinal embracing of higher-than-normal inflation. As the article says, it isn't clear what his plans are - all we know is he wants a weak dollar. His posturing at independent agencies like the Fed might be a clue, but that's purely speculative.
* Mass deportation means loss of low-cost labor.
* Personal tax cuts are modestly inflationary.

All of the *together* seems to me to be a prescription for pretty significant inflation. Again - whether or not any of these policy actions are independently important or expedient for reasons that aren't (or are) economic, that is an effect they will have.",blancpainsimp69,747,426,0.7599999904632568,0.177396477060675,1721252433,/r/changemyview/comments/1e5u7gm/cmv_trumps_intended_economic_policies_will_be/,2024,7,changemyview,2024-07-17 21:40:33
1e0c7po,CMV: Antinatalism is an evil concept,"Antinatalism - the belief that it is morally wrong or unjustifiable for people to have children.

There is a large following on the r/antinatalism page that I have been watching for a few weeks now.  Many on the page tend to post about how they wish they have never been born, how humanity is a scourge to the earth, how people that have kids are extremely selfish for letting their kids into a world where they might feel pain.  I am very confused as to the entire movement.

Some antinatalists want all life dead, but I believe that to be a small percentage, most just want all humans dead so that the animals and the earth can live better without the polution from humans.

Do not animals experience pain just like humans?  More so even?  That seems like it would negate the majority of the antinatalists arguments.  That animals will continue killing each other in horrific ways even if humanity was gone.

It seems to me the best course for all life, grant it some antinatalists do not want any life, which is evil, the best course for all life is for the humans to survivie, continue to innovate and continue to learn how to bring life into a better way.

Humans are the most intelligent species, the most likely to harvest technologies to stop climate change, if you believe it exists, to stop suffering in all manner of ways.

I think the odds of my view changing are low, but I’d sleep better if I genuinely thought a different form of government could possibly work well for most people.   

My baseline belief is that democracy, as a broad-based feedback mechanism, helps drive social and economic prosperity over time because it holds the powerful decision makers accountable to the needs of the many. And that if this mechanism goes away, things get worse in large important ways (eg food / water safety, health care, and civil order) and in smaller ways (eg traffic, travel, and options for entertainment).

1eg8y7e,CMV: A woman that exploits a mans loneliness for money is just as bad as a man that exploits a girl that's struggling financially. ,"I just watched a YouTube video about a grown man that killed his entire family and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Webcam Models. The ""pay to play"" women that will talk to you and give you a show for money. Obviously she did not force this man to do what he did, but this guy clearly had issues, and she failed to use adequate judgement. She is an average looking women, nothing special about her, and yet some random guy from across the world is spending thousands and obsessed with her? She had to know he was not right in the head, nobody is that oblivious. But this case alone is not the reason for my opinion. This is happening all over the place online, you go to dating apps, men looking for companionship, you have escorts on there, scammers, women trying to exploit men in any way they can to come up financially, and it's often the lonely or unattractive men that are targeted. 

  
I believe this is just as bad if not worst than a wealthy man exploiting a woman who needs help financially. Women give you a set amount of time, and then you're out. At least in the case of a man exploiting a woman she gets a place to stay, resources, etc.. Not saying it's a vacation, but she is getting something to help her in life.

1dz40b2,CMV: Unqualified hatred of landlords is either hypocritical or impractical,"First of all, I'm not a landlord. I don't own any rental properties and haven't ever purchased real estate as an investment, but I've never seen anything intrinsically *wrong* with doing that.

However, over the last couple of years I've seen an increasing amount of redditors arguing that there *is* something intrinsically wrong with being a landlord ... that the basic idea of ""real estate as an investment"" is wrong, and that people who do it are fundamentally immoral. ""I wouldn't date a landlord"", ""landlords shouldn't exist"", that sort of thing. To me, that position is either hypocritical, fundamentally impractical, or nonsensical.

Now, to be clear: I'm not saying that all landlords are moral, or that there are no circumstance where ""property as an investment"" *is* immoral. I'm not arguing with people who have a problem with slumlords or predatory real estate companies or individual landlords that do everything they can to screw tenants out of money while never meeting their own obligations ... I've dealt with these people, and they suck. 

I'm focused on people that think the very idea of a landlord is wrong, which seems to boil down to one of three positions:

* **""Housing is a basic necessity of life, you shouldn't be able to profit off of it!""** OK... but the builder who builds the house wants money, the bank that pays the builder makes money off the loan... zooming out, you'll die a lot quicker without food than housing, yet people aren't claiming that farmers are evil or grocery stores are evil or chefs are evil. You'll die even faster without water, but folks aren't saying the utility company is evil for charging you for it. Why is charging people to live in a house they didn't build on land they didn't buy wrong? *This is a hypocritical position.*
* **""There's not enough housing -- landlords compete with homeowners to buy up houses and that drives up the cost of housing!""** If you think about this for a couple of minutes, you can see that landlords can't be the root cause of the problem here. There is a finite amount of people who need housing in any given market; prices go up because demand for housing outstrips supply of housing. Landlords buying up housing does nothing to decrease the supply of housing ... in fact, if it outpaces the growth of renters, it means rental rates go down, which reduces the value of rental properties. The issue here is that housing supply isn't increasing to meet demand. *This is a nonsensical position.*
* **""All property is theft. The only value comes through labor.""** From this perspective, ownership can only come through direct labor; your farm is yours because *you* work it, the food it produces is yours because it was created with *your* labor, and so on. Any form of capitalism is wrong; inheriting a house from your parents is wrong, having a 401k is wrong, opening a local bakery and paying employees is wrong ... etc. This is internally consistent, but requires a fundamentally different society than the one we live in -- and one that seems to produce much worse results. Yes, yes, ""real communism has never been tried"" and so on, but a capitalist-socialist hybrid seems to produce the best outcomes for the average person of any human society, so pragmatically I'm not trying to blow it up to be the next society to prove that real communism has never been tried.

Fair warning: I'm not super eager to debate with people who want to debate point #3 based on the belief that communism is the best economic model. If you're doing your best to actually live by these economic values I give you credit, but you will have to be *wildly* convincing if you want me to adopt a purely communist worldview.",badass_panda,0,820,0.4900000095367431,0.1611001964636542,1720535847,/r/changemyview/comments/1dz40b2/cmv_unqualified_hatred_of_landlords_is_either/,2024,7,changemyview,2024-07-09 14:37:27
1eaa9ks,CMV: It should be just as acceptable to tell an obese person to lose weight as it is to tell a smoker to quit,"This hit me a few days ago when my family asked me to participate in an “intervention” for my uncle who smokes probably 2 packs a day. I agreed to be a part of it.

During her speech, my cousin (who is probably 5’4 350lbs) said something like “I want you to be alive to see your grandchildren get born”.

As powerful of a statement as that was, I started thinking that if we had a similar intervention for her she would go apeshit. And people would consider it “fat shaming” and “fat phobic”, even though the intention would be the same: to stop her from slowly killing herself.

If you still aren’t convinced of the double standard consider a man who smokes married to a morbidly obese woman. What do you think would be seen as more socially acceptable: the woman telling him to stop smoking for the sake of his health, or the man telling her to stop eating so much for the sake of her health?

This isn’t to say that anyone should go around commenting on strangers’ weight. Just like it isn’t appropriate to comment on strangers’ smoking habit. But both are addictions and they should both be able to be brought up by loved ones without one being stigmatized more than the other.

Admittedly this is from an American point of view where obesity is very common and smoking is not. Maybe it’s not like that in other parts of the world but there is a definite double standard in America and that double standard isn’t justified.

1e8dlgg,CMV: The discourse on sexual assault has gone too far.,"(Incredibly controversial, I know.) 

Firstly, let me just say I’m obviously not talking about *serious* cases of sexual assault - things like actual rape, pedophilia, sex trafficking etc are all heinous crimes and obviously deserve to be condemned as such. I’m instead talking about less severe and more murky forms of SA - things like being kissed at a party by someone you didn’t know, being felt up by a partner you’re sleeping in bed with after you said you didn’t feel like having sex, etc.

I feel like theres this new idea that what used to be called “awkward moments” are now considered just as bad as full-on rape. Having someone slap you on the ass at an alcohol-fuelled party might feel gross and wrong, but is it really *that* life-altering and damaging? Not to mention so much of this discourse seems to treat human hormones as this on/off switch that can’t be influenced in any way by drugs, atmosphere, misinterpreted cues, etc.

And I say this freely as someone who has been both a victim of and committed acts of these “awkward moments.” I’ve had weird sexual experiences that I didn’t consent to, been kissed by random people, slapped on the butt, and so on, but I’ve also touched people inappropriately, made misguided attempts to hook up with someone, etc. 

The problem I see is that we are, at our core, sexual beings, and sexuality is an incredibly powerful and difficult thing to get a grapple on, so obviously mistakes are going to be made (especially so if you’re young and inexperienced.) In fact, I’d argue that unless you’re a nun or something it’s pretty much impossible to go through life without *some* awkward encounters, for both men and women. 

And again, I’m not talking about the more obviously terrible acts - forcing someone to have sex with you against their will, using a position of power/status to coerce others to sleep with you, etc. These are deeply wrong and should be punished. I’m just talking about the moments that might cross boundaries but usually have a far more innocent explanation than “he/she is a predator looking to exploit others no matter what.”

The only other alternative I see is that society eschews human sex entirely and we all become a bunch of shut-ins relying on future sexbots for pleasure, and nothing else. I mean honestly, with the amount of sexlessness being experienced by Gen Z and the incredibly arcane levels of consent education being promoted these days, it honestly feels like we’re already moving that way, but whatever. 

Anyway, that’s just my view. I’m fully prepared to be eaten alive in the comments. ",tired_lover,227,671,0.6100000143051147,0.160301773298884,1721534224,/r/changemyview/comments/1e8dlgg/cmv_the_discourse_on_sexual_assault_has_gone_too/,2024,7,changemyview,2024-07-21 03:57:04
1e5v5gg,"CMV: Even if a fetus were considered a fully-fledged human, abortion should still be permitted for the mother without limitations according to United States law. ","To start: I am not looking for moral appeals here. “It kills the baby” “it’s wrong” “it’s mean” “you shouldn’t have gotten pregnant” are not arguments against my position. I am arguing within the legal theory of the United States, not within a moral framework for this argument. 

Assumptions: I grant for the sake of argument that an unborn fetus is a human being with all rights that should be accorded to natural born citizen. 

As an aside, in an extreme view of this position I would hold that once viability has been reached, the fetus should be eligible as a tax dependent, a co-rider for carpool lanes, and should have a social security number, etc. Please note that personally I do not feel that this is true, but for the sake of a stronger argument, I am allowing the pro-life side a stronger starting position: ie; granting the fetus full-personhood. 

Argument: The fetus is a human being who cannot survive without a birth. This human will die if they do not leave the womb through a medical procedure: ie, birth. 

This surgery is unique in that it requires a medical intervention on the body of the patient benefitting from the surgery (the fetus being born) but it also requires to consent and cooperation of a third party to be involved in and accept the dangers of the surgery: the mother who is giving birth. The fetus cannot be born, and thus cannot live, without being born by the mother, full-stop. The mother, on the other hand, can continue to live quite easily without going through the dangerous medical intervention that is childbirth. Her life is not endangered by the requirement to give birth, only that she is forced into a binary of doing something about the pregnancy, but abortion is significantly safer than a birth or Caesarean section, and in a purely pragmatic sense is the better option for her own health and wellbeing (assuming she does not want a child)

When taking this into account, the closest analogue I can think of would be a sickly sibling in need of a kidney. You are their only match. Without the kidney, your sibling will die, without question. And also without question, donating your kidney is dangerous, and poses a risk to yourself personally. 
But, while it may be morally wrong, or distasteful to not want to put yourself through the danger of that surgery to save your sibling, it is NOT MURDER TO NOT DONATE YOUR KIDNEY, EVEN IF THEY WILL DEFINITELY DIE WITHOUT IT. You choosing not to undergo a dangerous medical procedure that is unnecessary to your own personal medical wellbeing is not murder, even if that has the direct consequence of the death of another. It would insanity to force you to donate your kidney to a match, in the same way it should be insane to force a woman to give birth to a human. 

In fact, even if you had recently died, if you aren’t an organ donor, your rights to bodily autonomy, even as a corpse, trump your siblings need to violate your bodily autonomy in order to keep living. 

Even if all that was needed to save the person’s life was a single drop of your blood, you cannot be compelled to give it if I don’t want to. 

So why, when the rights of living, breathing, tax-paying, spouse-having, kidney-needing adult humans cannot supersede your abilities to make your own personal decisions regarding which medical procedures to engage in, should a fetus, even with the full rights of men, be able to do so?",cudakid210,369,566,0.6899999976158142,0.1574854328065715,1721254769,/r/changemyview/comments/1e5v5gg/cmv_even_if_a_fetus_were_considered_a/,2024,7,changemyview,2024-07-17 22:19:29

1e2558t,CMV: Wealthy students screaming ‘global intifada’ is causing the rise in Islamophobia.,"Happy to have my view changed here.

It seems to me that whenever there is an issue in the world it is comparatively wealthy students who, rather than help the situation, turn it into some kind of fashion trend and push it to a ridiculous extreme. This in turn stokes an equal and opposite reaction in the wider public.

With my limited knowledge of global politics, I would personally support a ceasefire in Gaza. I believe this view has pretty broad support (at least in the U.K.) The scenes coming through from the conflict are just too horrific to continue. 

This view is made controversial by calls for a ‘global intifada’ or ‘from the river to the sea’ of such other euphemisms for the destruction of the state of Israel (which I definitely do not support).

I suspect some might argue “when people say global intifada it just means ‘rising up against oppression’”.

I believe students know this phrase is incendiary and intimidating, with global connotations of violence. They deliberately stoke tensions by not simply calling for a ceasefire, but scaring people with divisive rhetoric. The aim being more about showing off to their friends, than affecting peaceful change.

This is then seen and broadcast by news organisations that are already unfriendly to minorities. Viewers see this rhetoric and conflate it with the views of ordinary Muslims in the west. 

The net result is it feeds into pre existing fears about Islamic extremism, and pushes people further into full blown inslamaphobia. Which we can see evidenced in the elections across Europe (Reform U.K., French National Rally, AfD in Germany all making huge gains). 

As usual, poor minorities get hurt, whilst wealthy students get likes and shares.

1egy8na,CMV: Packing the US Supreme court is a bad strategy in the long run.,"With its rulings over the last couple years, many people (Myself included) no longer believe the Supreme court is impartial or apolitical as it was intended to be, and that it's been internally compromised by corruption and partisanship. Supreme court reform is Obviously needed, and one common suggestion on how to do that is to pack the court. The concept is quite simple, with a larger court, a small biased minority will have a harder time influencing rulings, among other benefits.

There are issues with this however, the first being why and how the packing would begin. The most common suggestion for expanding the court is for Biden or Harris once she steps up (Assuming she wins) expanding the court to 13 justices, one for each circuit. The implication of course being that all five of the new judges would be young and liberal. This will cause issues down the line however, since republicans will be watching closely. The republicans will likely win at least one of the next 3-4 presidential elections, and when they do they'll be nothing to stop them from packing the court again, say to 17. Then Dems win again, and bump it up to 21. You see where this leads, the court will start ballooning, and justices will be blatantly political. With so many positions opening up, prospective justices may start all but campaigning  for them, hoping to be selected by party leadership on either side. If the packing doesn't stop then within decades the court will be a bloated, partisan, ineffective office where any pretense of them still ""interpereting the constitution"" will be long gone, as the SC becomes a third legislative chamber.",Working-Salary4855,400,474,0.7300000190734863,0.1432993867534406,1722459515,/r/changemyview/comments/1egy8na/cmv_packing_the_us_supreme_court_is_a_bad/,2024,7,changemyview,2024-07-31 20:58:35

1eh4u8e,"CMV: The word ""weird"" is going to destroy Trump's campaign","For those who haven't been following the election and the memes, basically the Democrats, mainstream media, and social media are attacking Trump's campaign by calling Trump / Vance and their supporters ""weird."" It's a similar tactic that Trump has used (i.e. Low Energy Jeb, Lyin Ted, Crooked Hillary, etc.). While this might sound like silly playground tactics, we've seen how well this works if the label actually sticks.

Well in this case, ""weird"" has really struck a nerve with the right wing and it's really sticking. The right wing Trump supporters have been getting really mad and angry about being called weird, like it's very tangible that it gets under their skin. Even Trump himself is not handling it very well.

In my opinion, there's 2 reasons why the word ""weird"" is making them so mad

(1) Because, let's be honest, it's true. Trump and his supporters are weird. The whole world outside of the US thinks they are weird. People in the US who aren't part of the core MAGA fanbase thinks these people are weird. Trump himself is weird. 

(2) Conservatives hate the idea of not being normal. This label doesn't work against progressives, because progressives generally embrace people who don't fit into traditional social norms. Conservatives are all about following traditional social norms, so when people start to call out that Trump and the MAGA core are abnormal oddballs, it really hits their ego.

Ok so why is this attack going to destroy Trump's campaign? Because nobody wants to sit at the lunch table with the social outcasts. Obviously the die hard Trump voters are going to vote for Trump no matter what, but basically the election is now framed as Kamala being the option for normal people and Trump being the choice for weirdos. Obviously this is whole thing is very silly and you could argue it's just name calling, but if I'm being honest, it's about time the Democrats started getting mean with their election strategies. I also think Trump and his supporters have acted like bullies for the last 8 years, so it's pretty satisfying to give them a taste of their own medicine. Call it petty, but it's an effective strategy. I might be biassed, but I really think the Democrats have found a banger political strategy with this, all it took was using Trump's own tactics against him ",CanuckP,5144,3017,0.7300000190734863,1.0,1722477159,/r/changemyview/comments/1eh4u8e/cmv_the_word_weird_is_going_to_destroy_trumps/,2024,8,changemyview,2024-08-01 01:52:39
1f2pjou,CMV:  Democrats are getting overconfident about the possible debate between Kamala and Trump. ,"I wanted to make this post for quite a while but couldn’t find time to respond to people who will respond to my post.

Before the first debate, I read a lot of left-wing blogs which kept saying Biden would trounce Trump in the debate.  At that time itself, I felt that he should not debate Trump because there is no benefit for him and nothing that Trump says will hurt him with his base. In other words Biden has all to lose and Trump has nothing to lose.

The debate went magnitudes worse than I had ever feared and it culminated with Biden, eventually, dropping out. 

 I now see the same thing with people eager for a Kamala vs Trump debate. I stand by my position that Trump has nothing to lose in this and Kamala has everything to lose. Trump could get on stage, crap his pants, and sling his poo at the audience and he would still not lose a single supporter. Granted, he won’t gain any supporters from such behavior either . Kamala on the other hand could make a mistake like she did against Tulsi in 2020 and could destroy the campaign as it is. 

So there you have it. That’s my view. Change it.

1evrkc0,CMV: I don't really understand why people care so much about Israel-Palestine ,"I want to begin by saying I am asking this in good faith - I like to think that I'm a fairly reasonable, well-informed person and I would genuinely like to understand why I seem to feel so different about this issue than almost all of my friends, as well as most people online who share an ideological framework to me.

I genuinely do not understand why people seem so emotionally invested in the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian Crisis. I have given the topic a tremendous amount of thought and I haven't been able to come up with an answer.

Now, I don't want to sound callous - I wholeheartedly acknowledge that what is happening in Gaza is horrifying and a genocide. I condemn the actions of the IDF in devastating a civilian population - what has happened in Gaza amounts to a war crime, as defined by international law under the UN Charter and other treaties.

However - I can say that about a huge number of ongoing global conflicts. Hundreds of of thousands have died in Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Ethiopia, Myanmar and other conflicts in this year. Tens of thousands have died in Ukraine alone. I am sad about the civilian deaths in all these states, but to a degree I have had to acknowledge that this is simply what happens in the world. I am also sad and outraged by any number of global injustices. Millions of women and girls suffer from sex trafficking networks, an issue my country (Canada) is overtly complicit in failing to stop (Toronto being a major hub for trafficking). Children continued to be forced into labour under modern slavery conditions to make the products which prop up the Western world. Resource exploitation in Africa has poisoned local water supplies and resulted in the deaths of infants and pregnant women all so that Nestle and the Coca Cola Company can continue exporting sugary bullshit to Europe and North America.

All this to say, while the Israel-Palestinian Crisis is tragic, all these other issues are also tragic, and while I've occasionally donated to a cause or even raised money and organized fundraisers for certain issues like gender equality in Canada or whatnot, I have mostly had to simply get on with my life, and I think that's how most people deal with the doomscrolling that is consuming news media in this day and age.

Now, I know that for some people they feel they have a more personal stake in the Israel-Palestine Crisis because their country or institution plays an active role in supporting the aggressor. But even on that front, I struggle to see how this particular situation is different than others - the United States and by proxy the rest of the Western world has been a principal actor in destabilizing most of the current ongoing global crises for the purpose of geopolitical gain. If anyone has ever studied any history of the United States and its allies in the last hundred years, they should know that we're not usually on the side of the good guys, and frankly if anyone has ever studied international relations they should know that in most conflicts all combatants are essentially equally terrible to civilian populations. The active sale of weapons and military support to Israel is also not particularly unique - the United States and its allies fund war pretty much everywhere, either directly or through proxies. Also, in terms of active responsibility, purchasing any good in a Western country essentially actively contributes to most of the global inequality and exploitation in the world.

Now, to be clear, I am absolutely not saying ""everything sucks so we shouldn't try to fix anything."" Activism is enormously important and I have engaged in a lot of it in my life in various causes that I care about. It's just that for me, I focus on causes that are actively influenced by my country's public policy decisions like gender equality or labour rights or climate change - international conflicts are a matter of foreign policy, and aside from great powers like the United States, most state actors simply don't have that much sway. That's even more true when it comes to institutions like universities and whatnot.

In summary, I suppose by what I'm really asking is why people who seem so passionate in their support for Palestine or simply concern for the situation in Gaza don't seem as concerned about any of these other global crises? Like, I'm absolutely not saying ""just because you care about one global conflict means you need to care about all of them equally,"" but I'm curious why Israel-Palestine is the issue that made you say ""no more watching on the side lines, I'm going to march and protest.""

Like, I also choose to support certain causes more strongly than others, but I have reasons - gender equality fundamentally affects the entire population, labour rights affects every working person and by extension the sustainability and effective operation of society at large, and climate change will kill everyone if left unchecked. I think these problems are the most pressing and my activism makes the largest impact in these areas, and so I devote what little time I have for activism after work and life to them. **I'm just curious why others have chosen the Israel-Palestine Crisis as their hill to die on, when to me it seems 1. similar in scope and horrifyingness to any number of other terrible global crises and 2. not something my own government or institutions can really affect (particularly true of countries outside the United States).**

Please be civil in the comments, this is a genuine question. **I am not saying people shouldn't care about this issue or that it isn't important that people are dying** - I just want to understand and see what I'm missing about all this.",wellthatspeculiar,1500,2278,0.6700000166893005,0.5233282781707185,1724036641,/r/changemyview/comments/1evrkc0/cmv_i_dont_really_understand_why_people_care_so/,2024,8,changemyview,2024-08-19 03:04:01
1ex7bwp,"CMV: There is no justification for the October 7th attack by Hamas, it was a terrorist attack, committed by a terrorist organisation and should be condemned ","I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not supporting what Israel and the IDF are doing and I condemn all the war crimes that they commit, however this seems to be causing people to overlook the other side of the conflict.

While I am sure that a lot of the pro Palestinian protestors don't support Hamas, or the 7th October attack and are just supporting the innocent civilians who are caught and killed in the crossfire of the Israel/Palestine war, however there seems to be a growing number that do, and it should be a security concern in all countries, that there is growing support for Hamas which is a recognised terrorist organisation.

From my view, the October 7th attack is one of the worst terrorist attacks in history, it was an attack on civilians, and if the population size between the US and Israel are scaled equally, it is many times worse than the 9/11 attacks (and not just in death toll).

A lot of pro Palestinian protestors seem to always fail to answer (yes/no) if they are asked if they condemn the October 7th attack or Hamas and usually do one of the following:

1.  Start talking about what Israel has done and the civilians they have killed to deflect the question 

As I mentioned at the start, I absolutely condemn and am against what Israel has done to civilians, however this should never justify any attack on civilians, when this argument is used this is often spun as an ""oppressed people fighting back"" narrative, and while I agree that the Palestinian people have definitely been oppressed, the October 7th attack is not how oppressed people fight back, oppressed people do not brutally attack civilians, victims of the Nazi's holocaust did not start brutally attacking German civilians, and I think most can agree that German civilians did not deserve to suffer after WW2 because of what the Nazi's did.

2. Outright denial the attack ever took place/claims no civilians were killed 

I don't really have anything to say that people who genuinely think the attack never happened other than that Hamas recorded themselves doing this attack for the world to see, has made their intentions clear that this attack is what they wanted, and that they will do it again. (Very few genuinely believe the attacks never happened, but there are some)

3. Israel knew about the attack / let it happen / didn't respond to it to use it as justification for the war

I am not certain about the truth of Israel's knowledge of the attack, and I don't think we could ever be certain of it and I don't deny that the above could be true. Regardless, this can't justify the killing of innocent civilians who certainly did not know they would be killed that day, this is like saying the Nazi's were justified in killing civilians in France and Poland when they invaded, because the French and Polish governments could've easily known that Hitler intended to invade and commit genocide many years before. 

Overall, I think Hamas must absolutely be eliminated and destroyed once and for all, and Israel has a right to defend itself from Hamas, but Israel and the IDF needs to also be held accountable for war crimes against civilians, and there needs to be a clear distinction between pro Palestine supporters who only want to support the innocent civilians vs the Hamas supporters who are supporting a terrorist organisation, otherwise we could reach a very scary point where extremism on all sides of all conflicts is already rising, where a large number on both sides will support/justify the killing of civilians.",Le_Corporal,1076,2399,0.6499999761581421,0.502168247221164,1724188682,/r/changemyview/comments/1ex7bwp/cmv_there_is_no_justification_for_the_october_7th/,2024,8,changemyview,2024-08-20 21:18:02

So, at least in my opinion, I think I understand the ""man or bear"" thing, some women feel so in danger that they prefer the objectively more dangerous option to a man, so the mature emotional response would be to understand them and help them get over their social ""trauma"" (probably an improper term sry), meanwhile laughing at them doesn't really help anyone.

BUT it's still inherently Mysandrist and shouldn't be accepted; men do commit the majority of violent act and the majority of sexual assault, that is a mathematical fact, but its also a mathematical fact that (at least in the US, I'm not American but I'll use america as an example) black people commit a lot more crimes than white people per Capita yet a phrase such as ""better to be locked up with a gorilla than with a black man"" would be seen, rightfully so, as racist and this phrase would be rejected

1epa315,CMV: Most Muslims only care about Islamophobia when it’s done by “the West” or by “the Jews”,"Islam, despite the fact that the most populous Muslim nation on the planet is in Southeast Asia, is still haunted by a profound thread of arab chauvinism. It’s been this way since the beginning when you see conflicts in North Africa between the indigenous Amazigh and the invading Arabs that conquered the land. Arabs were given preferential treatment, their Islam was more pure, their language more civilized. 

The Amazigh were barbarians being rescued by the Arabs and the Prophet and raised to civilization. 

Today not much as changes. Arabic is still used in almost every mosque on the planet, regardless of the languages of the region, most imams are Arabic and the Muslim world is still generally oriented around Muslims. It’s why whenever there’s any news about injustice being done to Muslims in America or in Gaza you’ll see massive protests among Arab Muslims in those same western countries or even, despot the dangers, the repressive theocracies of the Middle East. 

Yet notice how they never make a peep over the blatantly anti-Muslim tactics of China or the Rohingya in Myanmar? That’s because they’re just some Asians to them that happen to be go to a mosque. Not Muslims with caring about. Not Muslims worth caring about when compared to the idea of THE JEWS OR THE US oppressing them.

1enf4mh,CMV: Kamala's shutdown of hecklers at her Detroit rally can't reasonably be interpreted as a stance on Palestine,"The timeline as I understand it: 

* Kamala met with the protest group and talked to them prior to the speech.
* The protesters get rowdy and disruptive during the speech and Kamala reminds them that, while they have a voice, it's her time to speak.
* They persist and she shuts them down more harshly
* People who didn't think it through, didn't know the context, or just don't care make a big deal out of it and try to shame her and everyone else as being ""pro genocide"" as if those were related.

So basically, I want to know what possible perspective or information I missed that makes this wrong. There certainly seem to be a lot of people (bots?) who are just going nuts over this issue turning all their frustration and hostility about the middle east against Kamala and anyone who points out that this was about interruptions, not anything else.

What would change my view - information that changes the context of what happened, some other reasoning that what she said could reasonably be interpreted the way some people are taking it.

1et0lpa,"CMV: most criticism of ""incels"" is useless/unproductive because it relies too heavily on a just world fallacy. ","To start off. When I say ""Incel"" I mean the dictionary definition ""involuntary celibate"" somebody who wants a sexual relationship but for whatever reason is struggling or incapable of finding one. 

And the fact that I have to place a clear definition here is part of my view. Most of the conversations I see regarding incels turn into semantic arguments because people have a very specific stereotype in mind of a ""misogynistic overweight neckbeard who doesn't bathe and hates women because they don't want to sleep with him"" 

This I feel relies too heavily on a just world fallacy that dictates that these people must inherently be struggling due to personal/moral failings. Because if they weren't misogynistic/unhygienic/antisocial they wouldn't be having difficulties. 

I feel as though the world is not so just. And that there is a silent majority of incels who are struggling to find partners due to issues like neurodivergence and unhealthy or unrealistic standards placed on men (aka, toxic masculinity) in the realm of dating. 

As such, the advice most frequently given to this group to ""shower more"" and ""treat women like people"" is redundant and not at all helpful. Because it comes from a place of presumption based in the aforementioned just world fallacy.

1f4aebw,CMV: The 'both sides are do nothing corporate stooges' attitude that many far leftists hold is wrong and dangerous,"I've seen a lot of people on the far left saying that Democrats and Republicans are very similar and both doing the bidding of their corporate masters. 

As a Democrat, I vehemently disagree. I do acknowledge that large corporations contribute a significant amount to Democrat campaigns, but Democrats have also passed-and tried to pass- policies that limit corporate power. 

For example, reducing the cost of insulin. Big pharma doesn't want those limits.

Democrats attempted to pass build back better but a now independent and another now independent allowed it to fail. That was major legislation that would have helped a lot of people and Democrats fought tooth and nail to pass it. 

Democrats have also implemented additional regulations around things like food safety. This does not help big corporations in the slightest. 

That's why I think the attitude is wrong. I think it's dangerous because of two far more critical differences. 

First one side is trying to undermine Democracy while the other is trying to protect it. And the idea that at the end of the day both parties are do nothing corporate stooges completely misses the very real threat of somebody who will not concede even when it appears they know they've lost. 

Second, one side is going to great lengths to fight a major existential threat-climate change- and the other seems to still be dragging their feet. And while I think Democrats need to do way more to fight climate change, at least they have passed policies to help with that. 

To be clear, my view isn't that the far left thinks the two parties are identical. My concern is that they're being grouped and this makes it seem like what's happening right now is normal politics. The GOP is its own nightmarish thing right now, something highly unprecedented and dangerous. If dangerous individuals are seen as just more corrupt candidates in a two party system, then that makes it seem like they're a reasonable but not great choice. Not an aspiring dictator.

1emk4vd,"CMV: Saying ""Tax the rich"" and then discussing income tax is a misinformative bait and switch.","As far as I know there is not a single person who became a billionaire primarily through income. Every billionaire became a billionaire by buying or inheriting some asset (property, land, stock, etc.) that increased in value to a billion+ dollars. 

I suspect this is also true for the majority of millionaires, saving up a million dollars through income is doable, but there are loads of people who just bought homes in CA or in big cities in the 70s and are now millionaires through housing inflation. 

Also this is tangential to my main view, but I think someone who made a million in income has 'earned' their wealth way more than someone who just got into an asset market at the right time or is snowballing generational family wealth. 

I understand that there are practical problems with taxing asset wealth

* Evaluating how much an asset is worth isn't easy. 
* Taxing someone based on their asset might force them to sell the asset, which might drive its value down and create a lot of other problems.
* People with a lot of asset wealth would probably just move somewhere else to avoid the taxes. 

(I also think [land value taxes](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty) solve a lot of these problems in an elegant way.) 

However instead of discussing any of this, what I see a lot of people in political discussions do instead is just fall back on income taxes as if they're a real way of combating wealth inequality. When I see politicians go ""We need to address wealth inequality, here's my proposal to increase income taxes on people making over <X> a year"" it just feels like a sleazy way to give the appearance of doing something to people who are angry about wealth inequality but don't know much about it. Maybe this is overly cynical but at best it seems like a way for old money to keep out new money. 

IMO any discussion about wealth inequality should focus on how to practically implement wealth taxes, or on ways to limit asset bubbles/speculation cycles that come about from QE / increasing money supply. Discussing income taxes seems like a total red herring.",aahdin,1319,517,0.8799999952316284,0.2138887607342735,1723056979,/r/changemyview/comments/1emk4vd/cmv_saying_tax_the_rich_and_then_discussing/,2024,8,changemyview,2024-08-07 18:56:19
1eqqmjp,CMV: You shouldn't be legally allowed to deny LGBT+ people service out of religious freedom (like as a baker),"A common example used for this (and one that has happened in real life) is a baker refusing to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple because they don't believe in gay marriage.

It would be different if someone requested, for example, an LGBT themed cake (like with the rainbow flag on it). In that case, I think it would be fair to deny them service if being gay goes against your religion. That's different between discriminating against someone on the basis of their orientation itself. You wouldn't make anyone that cake, so it's not discrimination.

1ejeap5,CMV: American Politics Alienate Moderates,"I live in a swing state so maybe this issue isn't relatable to non-swing states. I consider myself politicly moderate and the I have never felt more alienated. Political ideologies between democrat and republican are more polarizing than ever, and if I make the mistake of speaking of anything remotely political during an election year to someone who affiliates themselves with either party as soon as I express a viewpoint that is contrary to theirs's they act like I may as well be burning down the capitol. Most political ads focus on tearing down their opposition instead of their plans or policies. I know some of this is a result of first past the post voting, and it's a combination of this and the electoral college that makes my vote and viewpoint in politics feel alienated. I also can empathize with the fact that being blue or red in a non-swing state that is the opposite color can make voting feel even more pointless. I believe in democracy, but I feel like the nature of politics is driving a wedge between people that's hurting us as a whole.

I know a lot of this is subjective... but I really do want this viewpoint of mine to change and this seems to be the place on reddit for that.

1erlpti,"CMV: A lot of incels have standards for a partner that are not in-line with their own value. They could date people, they just don't want to date the people that they could reasonably attract. ","My post is going to focus specifically on male incels FYI. 

So if there's a man out there that in general women would perceive as low value on the dating market, I do believe that they're generally not going to be able to attract a partner that is higher value than them. 

However, there are also women that are perceived as low value by men and many of these women would like to have a long-term partner, potentially get married, have kids, etc. 

Who do incels think these women are marrying if not men that are equally perceived as low value on the dating market? 

I think a common thought amongst incels is that these low value women are able to date ""out of their league"" because higher value men are most willing to do that. I think that's probably true but I think that most of the time those relationships are short-term in nature which leads me back to my original question, who are these women marrying? They're marrying other people that are of a similar value or slightly higher as them.

What is preventing incels from just lowering their standards? Lower them, give it a try, if you don't have any success then guess what your standards are probably still too high. 

If I have a car that I want to sell for $X amount and I attract no potential buyers then I'm not involuntary unable to sell my car, my expectations are just not in-line with the reality of the market. 

I think it's pretty certain that a lot of incels would have to lower their standards to such a point where they would no longer be interested in dating the people they could reasonably attract. However, does that make you involuntary celibate? That sounds voluntary to me because you would be making the choice that you are not interested in dating the people that it's possible for you to date. 

TLDR: Incels need to lower their standards. There are plenty of women out there that are also perceived as low value out there that are looking for long-term relationships and they generally will end up with a partner of a similar value to many incels.

1em1vh4,CMV: There is no good solution to the birth rate problem,"Every single nation that reaches a certain standard of living experiences a drop in fertility rate below the replacement rate (2.1 children per woman). This is a good thing because it stems from increased education, healthcare, and access to contraceptives for women. Most rich countries have been maintained population stability/growth through immigration, but countries like Japan and South are unfortunately headed for a slow decline and demise. Immigration isn’t a long term solution to this problem though, since the entire world’s fertility rate is projected to drop below 2.1 by the end of the century, and there will be very few countries left with fertility rates above 2.1. 

Eventually the world economy will go the way of Japan and South Korea, and there’s really no good solution that can prevent this. People simply don’t want to have more than 2 kids once they are rich enough to decide that for themselves, no kinds of monetary incentives or generous parental leave policies have succeeded at reviving fertility rates to replacement level.

1exwwiv,CMV: gifted programs should not be removed from any STATE. ,"The Seattle school district and many other left-leaning states are planning to remove gifted programs for children due to a lack of racial representation in these programs. I believe this is unjustified and doesn’t make sense. It would be like making professional athletes go back to playing in an academy.

As someone who was part of a gifted program in high school, I found that regular schoolwork wasn’t challenging or engaging. It made me dread going to school, as it felt like placing an adult in a kindergarten class to learn 1+1 and expecting them to be excited about it for the next three years.

It’s also unfair to teachers and administrators, who are expected to adapt and create convoluted curricula for each individual when students are not separated by performance. They’re already underpaid and are being further burdened by the government to do extra work.

What happened to academic meritocracy? Why are we equating racial segregation with intellectual segregation?

Imagine if sports teams had similar policies, where instead of always picking the best players, they had to meet a racial quota.

Some might argue that gifted students have greater access to resources, which allows them to perform better in school, making it unfair for them to access better education and opportunities. But that same logic could be applied in reverse to any aspiring athlete: If someone had better access to equipment, nutrition, and trainers, should they also be excluded from gifted athlete programs?

No taxes on tips means lower Social Security earnings, which will reduce benefit payments when workers retire. 

I don't see a benefit to this proposal bc restaurant workers are often in the lowest tax brackets, so their taxes are usually minimal and their taxable earnings are often reduced to under $20,000 and offset by things like the earned income credit and child tax credits.  

While a few extra in tax savings seems like a great idea, in the long-run it is bad bc of reduced payroll tax receipts and reduced Social Security benefits for restaurant workers.  Please CMV.

Imo this is kinda biphobic, bc as far back as the 90s bisexual organisations have been very clear that many bisexuals are attracted to people outside the gender binary, I myself have always been attracted to all genders. I have once seen the distinction explained as pan people are attracted to trans people, and bi people aren't, but not only is that hideously transphobic, but also patently untrue.

1ew7ow3,"CMV: If You Vape Indoors in Public, You're a Dick","I feel like this should be common sense, but I still see a lot of people doing this and I want to hear the other side of the argument: why do you think it's okay to vape indoors in a public place?

I've seen this a number of times near me: a patron at a bar or restaurant sneaks a puff from their vape as soon as the bartender or server turns their back. It's easier to do, since it's quicker than lighting a cigarette and the vape pen can dispense just one puff unlike a cigarette. Clearly they know it's not allowed, or they wouldn't take measures to hide it too. 

The only argument I've heard is that ""it's just water vapor"", but that's just not true. The vape smoke has nicotine in it (that's sort of the point), as well as other chemicals to give it it's flavor/scent.

It may not be common knowledge, but the chemicals themselves have harmful effects on the lungs. If the smoker isn't aware of that, that might be (comparatively) understandable. However, they should be well-aware of the second-hand nicotine smoke they're blowing at people. Ignoring this seems selfish, and therefore dickish.

1eugkeu,"CMV: ""States' Rights"" has never been an argument for freedom; instead, it has been used to oppress people.","##The Founding.  


In the US, the phrase ""states' rights"" has been used at times to call for a limitation on the power of the federal government. For those outside the US, our government is comprised of ""states"" which are supposed to be sovereign entities united under a ""federal"" government.  

In theory, this distinction was supposed to ensure that each U.S. state could operate as its own territory with its own government. The ""federal"" government was envisioned as some kind of entity which could both serve to unite the states and protect them on a more continental or global scale, and to bind them together locally so that each US state could consider its neighbors as allies and fellow citizens of some kind. 

This has, of course, *always* been a messy, imprecise concept. From the very beginning, the framers and anyone knowledgeable about governments disagreed on what the roles of these entities was supposed to be. We started, of course, with a failed concept known as ""The Articles of Confederation"" which was supposed to serve the same role as above but was entirely too weak to accomplish anything at all. The framers of the US constitution, it turned out, realized that any government entity **needed** to have enough power to actually assert its will over the people and territories, otherwise it simply couldn't. 

So the Articles of Confederation were a failure. It was an attempt to ensure the sovereignty of the states by limiting the power of a federal government, but that limitation proved to be its demise as absolutely nothing of meaning could be accomplished, rendering the system pointless.

##States' Rights and Slavery.  


So the state delegates got together to change them, but instead scrapped them entirely and wrote the US Constituion. This established the current United States of America. Among the debates and disagreements at that time was the issue of slavery. And what did they do? They ""compromised"" in the spirit of ""states' rights."" 

It was argued that the southern states had ""a right"" to practice slavery if those in control of those state governments wanted to do so. And those in charge of those state govenments were white slaveowning men. So of course, *they* decided what their ""states' rights"" were to be. 

#The concept of ""States' Rights"" has never been used - nor has it ever been needed - to expand human rights; instead, it has been used primarily to divide humanity and oppress marginalized groups.  

##States' Rights and Abortion.  


The phrase has been used in countless political debates, but few as conspicuously as the question of slavery. Most recently, it has been used on the question of abortions. 

 *Roe v Wade* was a Supreme Court case decided in 1973 which established that a person has an inherent right to privacy in their medical treatment to Due Process under the 14th Amendment. In general, this is the case which prevented US states from passing laws that restricted abortion. 

Come to *Dobbs v Women's Health*, the 2022 Supreme Court decision, and *Roe* is completely overturned. And on what basis? In large part, that the question of abortion *should be decided by the states.* This notion of ""states' rights"" was in the majority opinion, it was in the oral arguments, and it was flung around by media pundits and repeated by the casual conservatives celebrating the decision. 

***""States' Rights.""***

But what interest does ""a state"" have to ""rights?"" A state is nothing more than an abstract entity comprised of people making decisions ""as a state."" Why should ""a state"" have more authority to make decisions than a ""federal government?"" Why is that intrinsically more just than either a federal government or an individual? 

In short, it isn't. Pushing abortion to the states means pushing abortion to many legislatures that are interested in oppressing women, just as pushing ""slavery"" to the states was nothing more than pushing slavery to legislatures interested in oppressing people with African ancestry. It's a cushion; a dodge; an abdication of responsibility for deciding what is just in this country. 

If the federal government is infringing on ""states' rights"" by restricting abortions, how in the ever-loving ***fuck*** is a state not infringing on women's rights by restricting abortions? 

##States' Rights and the Electoral College.  

The Electoral College (EC) is another example of asserting that ""states"" should.have power, but not individuals. It was established in the US constitution in conjunction with the 3/5 compromise, which determined that enslaved people would count ""as 3/5 of a person"" in the state for the purposes of population count, representation in Congress, and therefore, in the Electoral College for presidential elections.  

Modern arguments in favor of the EC often say that the states with smaller populations would be forgotten and their interests ignored if it were abolished. This ensures ""the states"" all have their interests heard. But that is what *Congress* is for. The states with smaller populations *already have* representation in both the House of Representatives *and* the Senate. Both of which give greater weight to less densely populated (and, coincidentally, conservative) areas.  

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in the vote for president than *the people?* 

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in governing abortion than the people who can get pregnant?  

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in protecting slavery than the people who are being enslaved?

The answer is that the logic is unsound, because the question of ""states' rights"" has always been a messy and logically inconsistent affair. 

If you want to make a case for limiting government, do so without permitting lower-level governments to oppress people.

1f0aj6r,"CMV: In the ""would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck"" question, picking one horse-sized duck is a strikingly stupid choice","I know I'm like 8 years late on this meme, but I feel like it faded away without reaching much of a consensus and it made me feel like an insane person because the answer seemed so incredibly obvious. So here I am dredging it up again, like an insane person. First, some priors about the hypothetical I'm addressing: 

* Let's discount the oft-cited cube square law which posits that a horse-sized duck would immediately collapse under its own weight. In the spirit of the hypothetical, let's assume physically viable animals whose strength and bone strength etc. has scaled linearly with their mass to allow for normal function. 
* Let's assume we have no weapons, or at least no sophisticated, pre-made weapons. I'm working from an assumption that we're totally unarmed, but if you want to argue a situation where we could pick up a stick or a rock or something I'm happy to engage with that as well. 
* You are allowed to wear normal clothing, e.g. let's say you are given 10 minutes in a normal department store to pick out an outfit. I'd be okay entertaining a scenario where you're naked, too. My main point is that you don't have access to armor or anything (though i think having armor would make the answer even more obvious.) 
* The animals in question fully understand that they are in a fight to the death against you. 
* The question is very specifically about who you think you are most likely to defeat; any questions about gaining glory or other social consequences are outside the scope of this argument. 

Okay so on to my position: 

**Picking a horse-sized duck is not only obviously wrong, it's downright foolish.** 

Let's start by focusing on the horse-sized duck and (an incomplete list of) the opportunities it has to kill us vs. how we could kill it:

* The duck would be *much* stronger than you - strong enough to break your bones with a peck or claw attack. Strong enough to kill you outright with a properly-landed blow. 
* The duck's beak is huge, rigid, and would be capable of devastating bludgeoning damage. 
* The duck's beak would be plenty big enough to grab you by the head, a limb, even your torso. 
* The duck's beak would likewise be able to bite you with great force, possibly enough to break your bones. 
* The duck has claws on its feet that it could use to rip you open. 
* The duck can *fucking fly*. And even if we agree for some reason that it can't, it's still a massive animal that can kill you in a single blow. 
* You have basically no method to kill the duck unarmed. Maaaybe you could get lucky and break one of its legs, but you're still left with an extremely large, angry animal that can easily break your bones by just flailing around. The duck's neck is too large and strong to be choked out. Possibly you could stuff yourself or objects down its throat until it chokes? But even then, you are attempting a precise maneuver against a massive animal that is also trying to kill you. 

Now to contrast let's examine the duck-sized horses:

* The horses would be *much* weaker than you - any individual horse would be unable to do much more than lightly push you a bit. 
* The horses' mouths, while formidable in a horse-sized animal, would be too small to even gain purchase on most of your body. When naked, you'd run the risk of maybe getting the tip of a toe or finger bit off, or maybe a light pinch on your shinbone or something. If you were could dress yourself, wearing basically any clothes at all would render you nigh-invulnerable to this attack. 
* That leaves their kicks, which would be an annoyance but unlikely to do any real harm besides light scratches and bruises. Their hooves are not particularly sharp and are certainly not designed to puncture or rip skin. The blunt-force damage that makes a normal horse so dangerous would be rendered basically moot by their relatively small size and lack of strength. 
* Horses are not particularly intelligent animals and are not capable of any kind of meaningful tactical collaboration. This massively mitigates the potential problem posed by the large number of horses. 
* Similarly, horses cannot climb or grapple you, so your exposure would be limited to a few horses at any given time. This fact, combined with the previous point, means that there is very little threat of being overwhelmed and dragged down. At least until you have already worn yourself out to the point of exhaustion. 
* Horse legs are notoriously spindly and fragile. While scaling them down would reduce the risk of broken legs, it would still be pretty easy to break their limbs and incapacitate them. 
* You could kill or at least incapacitate the horses with normal kicks and stomps. You could easily pick up a horse and snap its neck, especially given the extra leverage offered by their long heads. A hundred is a pretty big number, but every individual horse would be trivially easy to defeat. The main challenge here is cardio, not fighting skill. 

Please note: I am NOT saying that I, or anyone, would obviously defeat 100 duck-sized horses every time. I am very specifically talking about the choice between 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck: on this question, I think the average human has about a 99% better chance of defeating the horses than they do the duck and I seriously question the judgment of anyone who picks the alternative.",tsaihi,630,433,0.8799999952316284,0.1329964184293152,1724520014,/r/changemyview/comments/1f0aj6r/cmv_in_the_would_you_rather_fight_100_ducksized/,2024,8,changemyview,2024-08-24 17:20:14
1esk1k8,CMV: Dogs shouldn’t be welcomed everywhere,"Tonight I went to an outdoor concert under the summer sky. Gorgeous evening at twilight attended by about 30 people. 3 guests brought their dogs. The dogs were barking throughout the performance, about 1 bark/min. It really punctuated the atmosphere. (Importantly, this was a free orchestra concert, we didn’t pay to be there.)

One lady kept turning to her dog and saying “No…” Lady. IT’S A DOG. It doesn’t understand. I love that my fellow millennials strive to be nonjudgmental but one upshot of this is that when we violate social norms, maybe we won’t be corrected. Sticking around with your barking dogs at the expense of everyone else was not cool.

1ehibx3,"CMV: If you don’t even vote in your local elections, then you have no right to bitch and moan about national/global politics.","I will never comprehend the egregious levels of self-important cuntiness it takes for people (especially on this platform, but elsewhere too) to make political ideology the largest facet of their personality, while taking absolutely zero action within their own sphere of influence.

You are not important enough nor are you educated enough for your perspective on geopolitics / macroeconomics to matter one fucking bit. Don’t flatter yourself. You care so much about these things because you lack a sense of control in your personal life, and pontificating about things much larger than you is simply a mechanism for escapism. Herein lies the truth of your mental illness masquerading as virtue and competence.

You chose to focus on large-scale issues for several reasons. First, the more wide-reaching the scope, the more morally superior you get to feel about yourself for caring about it. More accurately, being *seen* to care about it. To that end, national/global issues have a larger community surrounding them, which is a necessity for placating your narcissism. How else would everyone else know how wonderful of a person you are? And, the biggest reason of all:

You only care about large issues because you know that you have, and will always have, exactly zero impact on the outcome. As long as that’s true, you can skirt any sense of responsibility when it comes to making a difference. You get to have all the emotional feel-goods of being part of a cause, without ever having to contribute any effort. You avoid smaller-scale issues because you could actually do something about them. This would create a sense of responsibility that spoils any and all appeal. Since you have no ability to impact the outcome of far-reaching policies, your opinions and ideas have no need to be based in reality either, since they’ll never be tried. Your ideas don’t have to actually make any sense or have any chance in hell or working. All they have to do is come with some sort of virtuous vibe to get you the sense of moral superiority you crave.

For the vast majority of people (99.999%) your ideas are not novel. In fact, someone more powerful than you probably told you what to think, so you’re not a free-thinking genius either just because you hold some radical, contrarian opinion.

This is not to say that you are not allowed to have opinions on national / global issues. You absolutely can. What you cannot do though, is paint yourself as this bastion of human decency, focusing only on abstract bullshit you have no control over, all the while ignoring the parts of our flawed society that you can influence.

At the end of the day, it does not matter one fucking bit to the average person who is president. Your personal life will be impacted much more directly by the mayor of your town, your county’s board members, and the president of your local school board.

Until you’ve done your part to make a deference in those areas, shut the FUCK up about Ukraine, Israel, China, the military-industrial complex, Wall Street, gas prices, inflation, “capitalism,” “communism,” “socialism,” and UBI.",statisticalmean,499,485,0.6700000166893005,0.1288809692200392,1722523157,/r/changemyview/comments/1ehibx3/cmv_if_you_dont_even_vote_in_your_local_elections/,2024,8,changemyview,2024-08-01 14:39:17
1euk12y,CMV: Marxism doesn’t *have* to be authoritarian,"
A lot of people conflate marxism with communist authoritarianism, I want to address this issue. Marxism, in my opinion, has historically been a victim of ideological bad faith, both regarding the regimes that touted its philosophies and the regimes that contested (and thwarted) its proliferation elsewhere. I would challenge people to find Marx’s descriptions on class, value, or politics that are inherently authoritarian. If you can’t and instead you choose to believe that the practical evocation of marxism will always be authoritarian, even if the ideology isn’t, then my challenge would be to delineate why it’s an ideological issue. 

The Soviet Union, for example, stole the spirit of Marxism but never actually implemented its theories. Lenin tried to forcefully evoke Marxism by creating what he called a political ‘vanguard,’ which launched a coup and basically called his communist, fascist government ‘marxist-Leninism.’ Not to mention Russia at the time was suffering from immensely embedded political corruption and was also suffering economic loss and political sabotage from drawn out competition with the Western world. Here’s an example, alongside many, of marxism failing not due to marxist ideology, but due to geopolitical conditions when attempting to bring about marxist ideology (especially if it’s done in bad faith, how the nazi socialist party was to socialism) which ultimately failed in ever achieving a reflection of marxism. 

If marxism was evoked through grassroots organization in a gradual manner, something that needs time and can’t be necessarily forced, I believe it wouldn’t need to be corrupted by authoritarianism (which is inherently anti-marxist).

1em8hr4,cmv: abortion should be a right,"I want to share my perspective on abortion and why I believe it should be a right. To provide some context about me: I am personally pro-life (even though I am a man). If I were to father a child, I would commit to taking responsibility and supporting the child as best as I can, assuming the woman decides to keep the baby.

However, I also believe that I do not have the right to dictate what a woman does with her own body. If a woman becomes pregnant and is not in a position to safely and effectively care for a child, it would be wrong to force her to do so. Mandating childbirth in such situations can lead to a difficult life for both the mother and the child.

I’d like to hear different perspectives and have a respectful discussion about why or why not abortion should be considered a fundamental right.

1ehn4hl,cmv: Calling adults pedophiles for dating other adults have always been crazy to me.,"I just witnessed this man get called a pedophile because he’s 27 years old dating and 21 year old. I also witnessed another man get called a pedophile for dating a 26 year old at the age of 35.

Pedophiles are a group of individuals who are adults or older adolescent that experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.

This misapplication not only misrepresents the nature of these relationships but also dilutes the gravity of actual pedophilia, potentially undermining efforts to protect children from sexual abuse.

The age gap police need to calm down. It's understandable to want to protect younger partners from being taken advantage of, but labeling someone a predator just because their relationship doesn't fit your narrow view of what an age gap should be is unreasonable. This kind of reaction is excessive and unfair.

Two people of the same age can be at different stages of life due to various factors such as career paths, educational pursuits, personal choices, and life experiences. For instance, one 25-year-old might be advancing in a corporate career and contemplating home ownership, while another might still be in school, exploring different job opportunities, or traveling the world. 

Conversely, two individuals aged 21 and 29 can be in the same stage of life if their circumstances and life choices align. Both might be recent graduates starting their first full-time jobs, exploring new cities, or beginning to establish their independence and build their careers. These examples illustrate that life stages are not strictly bound by chronological age but are influenced by individual experiences and goals.",Unique-Technology924,659,316,0.8500000238418579,0.1164251138313682,1722534853,/r/changemyview/comments/1ehn4hl/cmv_calling_adults_pedophiles_for_dating_other/,2024,8,changemyview,2024-08-01 17:54:13

I understand most people who say things like this are trying to console the grieving family, but in my experience it just adds an extra layer of hate.

1f4roqi,CMV: The binding of Isaac in the Bible perfectly illustrates the problem with religious fanatism,"I am refering to [the story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac), first mentionned in the Hebrew bible and present in the religious texts of the 3 abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity an Islam).

In this story, God orders Abraham to sacrifice his only son to him as a test of faith. Abraham agree but is stopped at the last moment by an angel sent by God who tell him to sacrifice a ram instead.

One prevalent moral can be made for this narrative, faith in God must be absolute and our love for him must be equal to none, even superior to our own flesh and blood.

Which lead to two critisims I have, one directly tied to this tale and the abrahamic religions and the second about religious fanatism in general:

1. God is considered benevolent or even omnibenevolent (meaning he has an unlimited amount of benevolence) by his followers. That story (yet another...) directly contradict that fact as it depict him as egoistic, jealous, tyranic and cruel by giving such an horrible task for Abraham to perform. How can he remain worshiped if we have such depiction of him in the scriptures.
2. Considering God as more important and deserving more love than any of our relative is a way of thinking that I despise profondly. I don't consider having a place for spirituality in our live being a bad thing in itself but when it become much more prevalent than the ""material world"" it's when it can easily derail. Because when we lose our trust in the tangible and concret concepts we can basically believe anything and everything without regard as how crazy and dangerous it can be. After the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo occured, I remember listening to an interview with a muslim explaining how terrible insulting the prophet is for him because his love and respect of him are even greater than the one he have for his own family. How can this be an healthy belief ? How can this be compatible with our current society ?

I choosed this story because it seems to be quite prevalent in the abrahamic religions and displays how far one's faith can go. If you consider that God is so benevolent, his word absolutes and thus him ordering someone to kill his child is acceptable, there is something wrong with you.",vuzz33,215,565,0.6899999976158142,0.1145341960616125,1725012890,/r/changemyview/comments/1f4roqi/cmv_the_binding_of_isaac_in_the_bible_perfectly/,2024,8,changemyview,2024-08-30 10:14:50
1eox0xr,"CMV: The 2024 election will be quite similar to the 2016 election, just with the roles reversed.","If you look at it: For the first time in Trump's political career, he's had to put up with an opponent who draws comparable amounts of enthusiasm as him and one who's stolen much of his media thunder. I honestly don't think Trump knows what to do and I'm not convinced he'll figure it out before the election. What is funny, is that other Republican candidates had an idea that this would happen and yet Trump seems to have been caught completely and utterly off guard by Biden deciding to pass the torch. I won't deny there is always time for Trump to turn it around, but based on what's gone on so far it's not looking good, and we haven't even gotten to the DNC yet.

I also believe she'll carry Democrats over the finish line in both the Senate and the House.

2) Subsidies will flow directly to current homeowners offloading property or to developers who were sitting on property and seeing land prices skyrocket. 

3) tax payers are ultimately footing the bill of government expenses via direct tax payments or through resultant inflation... Effectively, we have a direct payment from the government to homeowners.

4) This policy is liable to create runaway demand for housing which outpaces the $25K due to people leveraging that money into a loan. This will in turn create another round of house price increase, and as a result, the property owning class is further enriched.

1ej4fvu,CMV: China peaked in 2019 and it is all downhill from here.,"There are so many crash circles happening in China. One really important thing to remember is that in 1990, almost 95% of the land in China was owned by the provinces. For 35 years now, the provinces have provided almost all social services and infrastructure projects by selling off land to developers. Now that developers are bankrupt and not buying land anymore, the provinces have no real income. They have no system set up to bring in taxes like a normal regional or state gov't can do... and as they do find ways to tax residents directly, that is putting pressure on consumer spending.

The other real death cycle is the number of middle class people who are paying a mortgage for a home that was never finished. You have a huge amount of people being forced to pay a mortgage and rent at the same time. In some cases it is even worse because the people got multiple mortgages thinking they could rent out their other homes. Having to pay double housing costs means people have far less money to spend in the economy on other things. Which leads to deflation.

Deflation is bad, even inflation under 2% is bad, because it means if you are a consumer, there is no reason for you to buy items today, because you know that in a month the item will be the same price or cheaper. This is why the USA and most EU countries have an inflation goal of 2%. It is low enough that it doesn't really hurt anyone, but it is high enough that it encourages consumer purchases. This keeps the economy churning. Deflation is also terrible for businesses, especially retail items like food, because if you buy an item for your store today, it might sit in your store for a month and have a lower price when you can actually sell it. This is crushing for low-margin businesses like supermarkets and retail stores.

This is all terrible, but equally bad is the covert ' decoupling ' by western companies, which have similar effects on the economy, and the current President Xi Jinping is doing all the wrong moves to save the economy. It's now even more censorsious, and even more authoritarian. 

Youth unemployment is nearly 40 percent, and number of desperate homeless people litter in every street. China's economic miracle is over and it'd be lucky if it can even be in Japan's lost decades, because at the rate things are going, it's going to turn into North Korea's lost decade.

1f1xm6c,CMV: All recreational drugs should be legal (including hard drugs),"Marijuana is now legal in many states, including my own (IL). But I personally think that all recreational drugs, including hard drugs, should be legal for adults/people over the age of 21+ (obviously not for kids). I know that a lot of people might think this sounds crazy at first, but hear me out.

There are many reasons why I think they should be legal:
- Making something illegal doesn't stop people from doing it, which the Prohibition taught us.
- It would be safer for drug users because they would know exactly what was in their drugs since it would be regulated, helping prevent accidental overdoses.
- People ultimately have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies, even if it's harmful, which is why drinking, smoking, eating unhealthy/being fat, and being promiscuous is legal.
- It would help stop illegal drug trade because there would be less demand since people could just buy drugs legally. This would help stop the cartel in Mexico.
- The government could tax it like they do with weed/alcohol/cigarettes, which would generate a lot of tax revenue.
- Statistically, most people who try drugs don't actually become addicted to to them (despite what DARE might have told you), including hard drugs like cocaine. There are also high-functioning addicts.
- For people who are addicts, they need help, not jail time. Jail would likely just make the problem worse, and it incriminates struggling people, making recidivism more likely.

1epkubq,CMV: Dance and performative events like 'Breaking' shouldn't be in the Olympics,"With all the Raygun crap and discussion around Breaking in the Olympics, I don't understand how creative/subjective performative events like Dance and Dressage are part of the Olympics. They don't seem like sports. 

I heard that Ballroom dance has been petitioning for a long time to be considered an Olympic 'sport' but not been successful and then pivoted to champion Breaking but that competition seemed vague and out of place. Even the staging seemed odd and out of place with MC's trying to hype an Olympic crowd. 

I don't get these 'sports' as sports - they are dancing with atheletic elements. I would argue Dressage, Synchronised swimming shouldn't be part of the Olympics either. I'd rather see Darts or Shuffleboard!  

Now the obvious counterpoint is Gymnastics as there is some performative element but the presentation of these events highlights difficult moves and then grades them against execution. It is presented with judges and there seems to be a process for quantifying clear cut winners and losers and has mutliple judges to iron out subjectivity. The same could be said of diving.

Ozempic I would even consider a mental health medication because it essentially removes the ability to experience the negative emotions we experience when our bodies start freaking out about perceived food scarcity (hunger).

One of the best indicators of adulthood obesity is having an ACE (adverse childhood experience) score of over three. The beginning of our current understanding of childhood trauma literally started at weight loss clinics.

With this in mind I present the following.

1.) Psychiatrists and Psychologists should be allowed to prescribe obesity managing medications. 

2.) Obesity should be a valid reason for mental healthcare to be covered by whatever system you get services from, wether the one we have in America (gross) or one run by your countries healthcare service

3.) Obesity should have talk therapy as a primary intervention. 

4.) Obese patients should be taught DBT ( Dialitetcal Behavioral Therapy) skills and management strategies  to increase their ability to deal with the negative emotions that come with being in a calorie deficit

5.) Obesity needs to be reframed to the public, it's not just that someone needs to eat less. It's someone needing to find a way to intake less calories (generally this is the cause of obesity), without the restriction becoming to miserable to be sustained.

 Managing obesity is something that is going to take trial and error and open communication between patient and provider, that happens way more often with a therapist than any other healthcare worker. 

Additionally there are ties to hunger levels and stress levels. Moving to a less taxing and stressful society also needs to happen if we want obesity rates to fall. It's real hard to sustain changes that make you feel bad when your material conditions also make you feel bad.

1fi41o4,CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy.,"If you're voting for Trump in the 2024 election, it suggests that you either have a lack of understanding about what has happened over the last decade and have been subject to misinformation, or are actively against democracy. 

There is a minority of Trump-voters who would like to see another system in place than the current system of democratic values, because they think their values and ideals are more important than democracy. Those who would rather live in a tyranny or other aristocratic system, as long as their needs and values are met. 

The vast part of the republican voters does not want to get rid of democracy - nor is it in their best interest - and are just un- or misinformed about current events. Even if your opinions are generally in line with most of the things Trump stands for, and you're actively opposed to everything Harris stands for, it should not matter since one side does not adhere to democratic values and the other does. I understand that a lot of information that people in the US get is heavily colored in favour of one candidate or the other

All of this has been made especially clear since January 6th; if you support a candidate that attempted to commit a coup d'était, you want to subvert democracy, or you don't have the correct information to make an informed choice.

I'm open to discussion and reconsidering my views if presented with new insights, as ""they're all misinformed or authoritarian"" feels overly simplistic. My perspective comes from observing recent events, but I'm curious to see whether my view is shaped by the news I receive or if there’s a more nuanced explanation.

1fboo3p,CMV: Hijabs are sexist,"I've seen people (especially progressive people/Muslim women themselves) try to defend hijabs and make excuses for why they aren't sexist.

But I think hijabs are inherently sexist/not feminist, especially the expectation in Islam that women have to wear one. The basic idea behind wearing a hijab (why it's a thing in the first place) is to cover your hair to prevent men from not being able to control themselves, which is problematic. It seems almost like victim-blaming, like women are responsible for men's impulses/temptations. Why don't Muslim men have to cover their hair?

I've heard feminist Muslim women try to make defenses for it. (Like, ""It brings you closer to God,"" etc.) But they all sound like excuses, honestly. This is basically proven by the simple fact that women don't have to wear one around other women or their male family members, but they have to wear it around other men that aren't their husbands. There is no other reason for that, besides sexism/heteronormativity, that actually makes sense. Not to mention, what if the woman is lesbian, or the man is gay? You could also argue that it's homophobic, in addition to being sexist.

I especially think it's weird that women don't have to wear hijabs around their male family members (people they can't potentially marry), but they have to wear one around their male cousins.

1ff2phz,CMV: Pedophiles Are Treated Unfairly,"Alright, calm down. I can already hear the pitchforks. I'll clarify two things before I begin: 

1: My post refers to **non-offending** pedophiles. Those who have an attraction toward children who have **not** committed a crime. Anybody who has committed an offence against a child should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. 

2: I am not a pedophile. Many people assume that anybody who speaks up on such a topic must automatically be involved, but the reason for my opinion is two fold. I was sexually abused as a child and I now work with young people who were released from a variety of institutions (detention centres, mainly), many of whom either suffered sexual abuse, or engaged in it. I am not a doctor, nor am I a psychologist. 

  
So, my view is relatively straightforward. I believe that society has demonised pedophiles to a point that makes life less safe for children. 

I believe that every non-offending pedophile should be treated with the same respect, care and compassion that we give to any other member of society who is suffering with a mental illness. Treatment in the form of counselling/therapy or anything else that is possible, should be widely available and completely confidential. 

I believe that the rhetoric of 'kill all pedophiles' does nothing but prevent these people from coming forward to receive the help that they need to stop them from acting on their thoughts. 

Finally, I believe that if we, as a society, showed more compassion to these people, and encouraged getting professional help like we do with many major mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc) that the world would be a much safer place for the most vulnerable members of our communities.

1fihxa0,CMV: there is such a thing as “being racist towards white people”.,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not white. I appear white, but most of my ancestry is Middle Eastern and Asian. I was born and raised in a Muslim-majority country. When I moved to the West, I was surprised to see how the white people here (particularly those leaning left) behave as if everything bad happening in the world is their direct fault. There is so much focus on being politically correct and tolerant, yet it seems to be the status quo to constantly shit on white people. 

I’ve had conversations with people who have this dislike for the white population, and they tell me that this hate stems from the West’s involvement in colonisation and now the white Westerners are to pay the price for the actions of their ancestors. This makes no sense. Many non Western countries out there have done horrible things, have invaded and colonised other states, waged cruel wars and the list goes on. Another argument I’m presented with is how there is still exploitation of particularly African countries by the Western nations. But how does attacking uninvolved white people help those impacted by this exploitation? Also, non Western countries also exploit other states.

There is absolutely such a thing as racism towards white people. Since I’m not white, people holding these views feel very comfortable talking bad about random white people and unironically call them colonisers in my presence. And the white folks will just take it all and apologise on top of it. Why? You never personally colonised anyone, if your great great someone did, that’s not your fault and not something you ought to make apologies for.

I don’t understand why you put up with this, especially in your own countries. It wouldn’t fly where I was born, but here it seems a societal norm even.

1fkl7y7,CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause,"I’ll start by saying I’m Jewish, and vaguely a Zionist in the loosest sense of the term (the state of Israel exists and should continue to exist), but deeply critical of Israel and the IDF in a way that has cause me great pain with my friends and family. 

To the CMV: Hezbollah is a recognized terrorist organization. It has fought wars with Israel in the past, and it voluntarily renewed hostilities with Israel after the beginning of this iteration of the Gaza war because it saw an opportunity Israel as vulnerable and distracted. 

Israel (I’ll say ‘allegedly’ for legal reasons, as Israel hasn’t yet admitted to it as of this writing, but, c’mon) devised, and executed, a plan that was targeted, small-scale, effective, and with minimal collateral damage. It intercepted a shipment of pagers that Hezbollah used for communications and placed a small amount of explosives in it - about the same amount as a small firework, from the footage I’ve seen. 

These pagers would be distributed by Hezbollah to its operatives for the purpose of communicating and planning further terrorist attacks. Anyone who had one of these pagers in their possession received it from a member of Hezbollah. 

The effect of this attack was clear: disable Hezbollah’s communications system, assert Israel’s intelligence dominance over its enemies, and minimize deaths. 

The attack confirms, in my view, that Israel has the capability to target members of Hamas without demolishing city blocks in Gaza. It further condemns the IDFs actions in Gaza as disproportionate and vindictive. 

I know many people who have been active on social media across the spectrum of this conflict. I know many people who post about how they are deeply concerned for Palestinians and aggrieved by the IDFs actions. Several of them have told me that they think the pager attack was smart, targeted and fair. 

I still know several people who are still posting condemnations of the pager attack. Many of them never posted anything about Palestine before October 7, 2023. I belief that most of them are interacting with this issue because it is trendy. 

What will CMV: proof that the pager attack targeted civilians, suggestions of alternative, more targeted and proportionate methods for Israel to attack its enemies. 

What will not CMV: anecdotal, unconfirmed tales of mass death as a result of the pager attacks, arguments that focus on Israel’s existence, arguments about Israel’s actions in Gaza, or discussions of Israel’s criminal government.

1f8d5lm,"CMV: Broadway would never allow a “Book of Mormon” style, satirical play on the Quran and neither would most Muslims","Say what you will about the LDS church but they at least have a good sense of humor about themselves. While the play is actually a love letter — in many ways — organized Christianity from atheists, it still does have many biting criticisms of the Mormon church and it takes having a somewhat of a thick skin to take them all with a smile. 

I don’t think this would be the same with Muhammad and Quran. In part because the God of the Quran is a lot more oblique and mysterious, the connection people feel with him is displaced to Muhammad instead. Hence the treatment of him as if he is god, not just a mortal man who’s his messenger. 

All this to say, there would be tons of public protests all over the world, bomb threats and gun threats in the lead up to opening day of the show. But, I think in all honesty it would be more outside America than within it. American Muslims, though they might be more upset with the blasphemous message and disrespectful tone, are pretty liberal overall and not much different from American Christians. Worldwide im sure there would be lots of “death to America and the gays on broadway” chants too. 

Nevertheless it would be an extremely volatile, toxic issue the pick-me Mercedes mujahideen type liberals who would lose their mind because they’d have to choose between treating Islam like Christianity conservatives or being “one of the good ones.” But if you’re in America, I can’t speak for anywhere else, part of the buy-in is being okay with people making fun of your religion.

1f905a1,CMV: Voter ID is a totally sensible policy.,"Some context as to my view: 
- I’m an American dual citizen. I have been old enough to vote in one presidential election in both countries. For the election outside of the US, I needed to have a valid ID that was issued by the government to all citizens over the age of 18 in order to vote. Having experienced this, calls for voter ID in the US seem totally reasonable to me, with one important caveat. There needs to be a way for American citizens to easily get an ID. Getting a traditional form of ID like a driver’s license or passport is not universally accesible, you need to know how to drive to get a license or pay in order to apply for a passport. If you fix this by getting the government to issue voter ID cards to people who apply for free, then I really see no drawbacks to Voter ID policies.

1f7a62j,cmv: Demisexual is not a real sexuality,"This goes for demisexual, graysexual, monosexual(the term is pointless jesus), sapoisexual, and all the other sexualities that are just fancy ways of saying i have a type or a lack of one. 

but i’m gonna focus on demisexual bc it makes me the most confused. 

So demisexual is supposedly when a person feels sexually attracted to someone only after they've developed a close emotional bond with them. Simple enough, right? Wrong, because sexuality is a person's identity in relation to the gender or genders to which they are typically attracted; sexual orientation. Which means demisexual is not a sexuality by definition. 

Someone who is gay, straight, lesbian, or bi could all be demi because demisexual isn’t a sexuality it’s just when people get comfortable enough to have sex with their partner, which is 100% fine but not a damn sexuality. not everyone can have sex with someone when they first meet them and that’s normal, but i’ve got this weird inclination that people who use the term demisexual to describe themselves can’t find the difference between not being completely comfortable with having sex with someone until they get to know them or feeling a complete lack of sexual attraction until they get to know someone. 

maybe i’m missing something but i really can’t fully respect someone if they use this term like it’s legit. to me, it’s just a label to make people feel different and included in the lgbt community.

1fes0nh,CMV: Israel Should Be Sanctioned for Killing an American Citizen Today,"My view is that this issue has reached a boiling point. This is not the first US citizen that Israel has killed American citizens. Credible claims point to no less than five American citizens whom Israel has claimed responsibility for killing (one way or another) in the recent past.

The most recent incident is particularly alarming in my view and does warrant actual sanctions as a response. Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was killed by a bullet Israel alleges was aimed at the **leader of a protest.** Amazingly to me, the White House has *hatched* a completely far fetched idea suggesting a sniper bullet ""ricochet"" caused an American civilian to be shot in the head and killed.

The glaring issue for me is that (just like in the case of Saudi Arabia) I do not understand why we are choosing to keep the taps flowing on money to ""allies"" who are carrying out **extra-judicial** killings of journalists or protesters, especially American citizens. My view is that a strongly worded letter, as promised by the White House, is simply not enough.

1f8mci4,CMV: Abortion is an absolute right.,"What is the point of the right to life if you don’t have bodily autonomy? 

First off, what bodily autonomy is and what it isn’t. Bodily autonomy isn’t the right to do anything you want with your own body. No, you can’t use the right of bodily autonomy to defend drinking and driving, self mutilation, or harming other people. It doesn’t give an airline pilot the right to “use his body” to crash a plane full of people. That’s ridiculous. What bodily autonomy is, is the right to determine who can use your body and for what purpose. While people tend to focus on its use when it comes to abortion rights, it’s also what gives us the right to refuse blood, tissue, and organ donation, the right that makes rape a crime, even the right of terminally ill patients to request and obtain a DNR order. It is directly related to the right to remain secure in one’s person as per the fourth amendment. Without the right to bodily autonomy, and the right to deny someone else access to one’s physical body, what is there to prevent having blood drawn or urine obtained against one’s will for testing?

Where this falls into the abortion argument is that the right of bodily autonomy allows a pregnant person to refuse the use of their body to a fetus. While there are those who say bodily autonomy doesn’t give a person the right to “murder”, what it does give a person the right to do is remove another person who is physically attached to their body, and using their blood, tissues, and organs against their will, even if that other person will die due to that removal. It doesn’t matter how that person got there, if the potential donor originally consented, or what the relationship is between the potential donor and the patient. The potential donor always has the right to refuse another person the use of their body and/or remove another person from their physical body regardless of consequences.

Now, while people look at this with the abortion argument as if you deny this right of bodily autonomy to pregnant people, they are not allowed to remove the fetus from their physical bodies, and this removing this right would “save babies”, removing any right from any person is a dangerous path to tread, and I have several examples of why.

Scenario 1: Abortion.

Patient A is pregnant. She wants to have an abortion to deny the use of her body to the healthy fetus she is carrying. The right of bodily autonomy allows her to do this. Without the right of bodily autonomy, she is forced to carry the fetus to term and give birth. While in most cases of a healthy fetus and a healthy mother, while there would be discomfort and pain during the pregnancy and birth, both would come out alive. However, all pregnancy has the potential to cause permanent injury to the pregnant person or result in the death of pregnant person, fetus, or both, even uncomplicated pregnancies. By removing the right of bodily autonomy from Patient A, we are forcing her to risk her health and her life against her will to support another person with the use of her physical body.

Scenario 2: Pregnancy and medical care.

Patient B is pregnant. She is planning to carry the pregnancy to term and deliver the child. While she is pregnant, she develops a medical condition such as cancer, the treatment for which can and would cause harm to her fetus. Because the fetus is prior to the point of viability, live birth isn’t an option for her child. The choice must be made to either abort the fetus and begin treatment of the mother, or maintain the pregnancy until the fetus is viable outside of the womb, and allow the cancer to progress and the mother’s survival odds to drop. Without the right of bodily autonomy, Patient B is not allowed to make this decision for herself. This is not a hypothetical situation. This was the reality in Ireland prior to the retraction of laws banning abortion. When the life of a fetus outweighs the right of the person carrying it to bodily autonomy means that a pregnant person cannot receive medical treatment that would require the abortion of that fetus so long as it has a heartbeat, nor can the pregnant person obtain medical treatment that could cause harm to the fetus. Removing the right to bodily autonomy removes the right of a pregnant person to choose their own medical care for their own medical conditions. Medications, treatments, and even certain testing would become unavailable based entirely on the contents of one’s womb. Broken limb? X Rays can harm a fetus. Cancer? Chemo and radiation can harm a fetus. Mentally ill? Most psychiatric drugs and treatments can cause harm to a fetus.

Scenario 3: Drugs, alcohol, and pregnancy.

Patient C is sexually active, but is using reliable birth control. As a result, being sure that she cannot become pregnant, she continues to drink, smoke cigarettes, and use recreational drugs. Because her chosen birth control interrupts her period (as some forms such as the IUD, the shot, or continuous use of the pill without use of the placebo week can do) she doesn’t have her period and thus it ending isn’t a tip off. It’s flu season and all her friends are sick, so her nausea is easy to explain. When she begins gaining weight in her midsection, she goes to the doctor where she finds out she is several months pregnant. Because she has been drinking, smoking, and using recreational drugs that are known to harm a fetus throughout her pregnancy, she not only must carry the fetus to term regardless of the medical condition of the child, but she can also be charged with harming the fetus she wasn’t aware she was carrying because again, without bodily autonomy, the rights of the fetus outweigh the rights of the person carrying it. Far fetched you say? It is the reality for pregnant drug addicts, even those who may be unaware of their pregnancy in most of the US, resulting in women being forced to maintain pregnancies while being forced to detox from their addictions, give birth to children born with addictions and severe medical problems, and then be charged with harming the fetus they didn’t even know they were carrying until it was too late.

Scenario 4: Blood, tissue, and organ donation.

Getting off of the topic of pregnancy, we’re going to move on here, because removing bodily autonomy doesn’t only affect pregnant women. You cannot use a medical condition to remove rights from a person of sound mind, therefore the right would have to be removed from all Americans.

Patient D is in need of a new kidney. Potential Donor E is a perfect match, but does not wish to be a living donor. Without the right of bodily autonomy, patient D’s right to life outweighs Potential Donor E’s right to refuse the donation. As a result, Potential Donor E is forced to undergo organ donation to save the life of Patient D.

An alternate scenario in this. Patient F needs a heart transplant to survive. Potential Donor G was in an automobile accident and while on life support is brain dead, making him a candidate for organ donation. His heart is a perfect match for Patient F. However, Potential Donor G’s religious beliefs state that he must be buried with his body intact. This is important to Potential Donor G and his family, and would prevent donation of any of Potential Donor G’s organs. Unfortunately for Potential Donor G and his family, Patient F’s right to life supersedes Potential Donor G’s right to determine if his body can be used in this manner, Potential Donor G’s body is harvested for organs, Patient F receives his heart, and Potential Donor G cannot receive the funeral and burial required by his religious beliefs.

Scenario 5: Rape.

Bodily autonomy is the right that says a person gets to decide what another person can do with their body. If we do not have the right to refuse someone else the use of our bodies, then where is the crime in rape? In particular date rape, or rape of unconscious individuals where the victim is not beaten or physically injured other than the rape itself. We already see this happening in cases like that of Brock Turner, who was given a light sentence for raping an unconscious woman. Part of the justification of his sentence was that a “promising athlete” shouldn’t have his life ruined for “twenty minutes of action”, as stated in a letter written by Turner’s father to the judge as a plea for leniency for his son. When we remove the right of bodily autonomy, this becomes the case of all rapes like this. Rape is no longer viewed as a violation of another person’s bodily autonomy, because that bodily autonomy no longer exists. It becomes a matter of punishing the rapist for “twenty minutes of action” as in the case of Brock Turner. The violation of Turner’s victim’s bodily autonomy wasn’t considered in his judgement, or at the least wasn’t considered to be more worthy of protection than Turner’s status as a student and athlete.

While yes, this is a slippery slope argument, it is important to remember that slippery slopes do exist, and when it comes to removing rights from individuals, slippery slopes are especially dangerous.",Morning_Light_Dawn,173,1943,0.5600000023841858,0.2566197804189928,1725430776,/r/changemyview/comments/1f8mci4/cmv_abortion_is_an_absolute_right/,2024,9,changemyview,2024-09-04 06:19:36
1fctdjq,CMV: Universal Healthcare is less expensive and more efficient than the private American model,"Universal healthcare is actually way more efficient than the system we have in the U.S., and despite what some people say, it won’t bankrupt the country. Plenty of countries have made universal healthcare work for them without sinking their economies. Take Canada and the UK, for example: they’ve had universal healthcare for decades and, overall, spend way less per person than the U.S. does. According to a report from The Commonwealth Fund, the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on healthcare as these other countries but has worse outcomes in key areas like life expectancy and chronic illness management.

A common argument against universal healthcare is that it would be too expensive and would require higher taxes, which could cripple the economy. But here's the thing, Americans are already paying a lot for healthcare, just in different ways. Instead of paying higher taxes, most people are dealing with expensive insurance premiums, copays, and surprise medical bills. While taxes might go up with universal healthcare, people would actually save more money because they wouldn’t be paying for private insurance or out-of-pocket costs. Plus, a single-payer system would allow the government to negotiate drug prices, which could further lower costs overall.

Some people point to long wait times in countries like the UK to argue that universal healthcare doesn’t work. Yes, the UK has had issues with wait times, but it’s not like the U.S. system is any better when it comes to accessing care. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Americans often have to wait just as long, if not longer, to see specialists, especially if they don’t have good insurance. And let’s not forget that a lot of Americans avoid going to the doctor at all because they’re worried about the costs, even if they have insurance. So, the argument about wait times doesn’t hold up when you consider the whole picture.

Another reason universal healthcare is more efficient is that it cuts down on the massive administrative costs that come with private insurance. Right now, a huge chunk of U.S. healthcare spending goes toward paperwork, insurance claims, and bureaucracy, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). With universal healthcare, you could eliminate most of those costs, allowing more money to go directly to patient care instead of getting lost in administrative overhead.

In the end, the U.S. is already spending a ton on healthcare but getting mediocre results compared to countries with universal systems. By switching to a more efficient system that focuses on prevention and removes the need for private insurers, we could improve outcomes and reduce overall costs without bankrupting the country. Other countries have figured it out, and there's no reason the U.S. can’t do the same.",TheAntiCoomLord,1206,967,0.8299999833106995,0.2554123267762653,1725898589,/r/changemyview/comments/1fctdjq/cmv_universal_healthcare_is_less_expensive_and/,2024,9,changemyview,2024-09-09 16:16:29

My reasoning is while MAGA is the monster, the Republican party and their policies are Frankenstein. They may not have come off as dump as MAGA supporters but the policies they support are just as oppressive. 

With regards to civil rights, can anyone name a policy where conservatives/Republicans were correct?  Gay Right, Abortion Rights, Voting Rights, their stances on each of these the majority of the American people disagree with them. 

With regards to economic policies  - All their solutions revolve around tax cuts, deregulation and privatizing industries that should be a basic public services not built on a profit model ie Public Education, Healthcare and cutting social safety nets.

1f72hcb,"CMV: Both presidential candidates endorse removing taxes on tips. It's a terrible, unfair idea. ","I don't see any positive aspects to this, only the following negative aspects.

1.  Why should a fast-food restaurant worker have a substantial tax advantage over, say, a Walmart employee with an hourly wage earning as much or most likely less? That's incredibly unfair. 

2. Some service/hospitality staff at high end restaurants make an excellent living on tips, why shouldn't they pay taxes like others earning a similar, or in some cases, far lower wage?

3. If you thought tipping culture was broken now, wait until everyone else who doesn't currently get tips starts demanding them.  Sure, maybe they'll set limits on which professions can get tips, but that will end up being a pretty complicated process. People in tons of different fields and professions currently get tips. Who gets them tax-free, and why?

1f91whl,Cmv: Republicans shouldn’t be voting for Trump after his attempt to remain in power after losing an election. ,"Trump tried to execute a bloodless coup after losing the 2020 election. The fake elector scheme, telling Pence not to certify the results, having states individually not certify the results, are all such damaging and despicable acts, that even if they agree with him on policy, should have stopped Republicans from voting for him in the primaries and even the general election. 

There’s no compelling evidence the 2020 election was rigged. Most of the federal judiciary at the time and the Supreme Court was made up of Republicans, many of whom were appointed by Trump, and yet Trump still lost in court. He and his supporters make plenty of claims in public, but as soon as they were under oath and had to submit evidence subject to cross examination, they had none. 

Trump’s attempt to subvert our democracy is so incredibly damaging. It’s incredibly dangerous to set a precedent where the party that loses the election can remain in power anyway. Dictatorship is almost universally a bad idea with bad outcomes. 

The arguments that Democrats do the same thing are so poor, I’m skeptical they are being made in good faith. There are one or two comments Hillary has made since losing that I think are damaging and that she shouldn’t have made, but it’s not comparable to what Trump did. Hillary conceded and did not try to remain in power after losing. She did not try to pursue illegal or unethical schemes to remain in power. Gore challenged the vote in Florida when he had a legitimate reason to think he might have won, and once he lost, he conceded and did not try to remain in power. 

If a Dem had done what Trump did, I would absolutely vote for a McCain or a Romney over the dem. Democracy is too important. 

The only possible exception to the argument that I see is for people who actually believe abortion is 100% truly murder. Unlike the 2020 election which was demonstrably not rigged, abortion is a murkier philosophical question so I find it difficult to simply dismiss their view even if I disagree with it. It is also hard for me to advocate for someone to vote for a party that is pushing for the legalization of murder.

1f90400,CMV: The lack of empathy towards people who want paternity tests and prenups is completely unfair,"It's not fair in the slightest to get mad at your husband for ""not trusting you"" knowing damn well that it's something you'll never have to worry about. It's a guarantee that the child is yours as the mother, why do you get to be 100% certain but your partner is an asshole for wanting the same degree of certainty? It demonstrates a complete lack of empathy in my opinion.

 30% of paternity tests come back negative, an absolutely staggering amount. Why is your partner a bad person for making sure that they don't dedicate their entire life to a child that isn't even theirs? Seriously, imagine being 60 years old and finding out that your 20 something year old children were never even yours, that's suicide inducing shit. 

Same goes with prenups. If you're the person who doesn't have the money, it's once again totally unfair to expect your partner put all of their assets on the line in the name of ""trust"". You're bringing nothing into the relationship, which means you have nothing to lose. It's easy to judge people when they have to make a difficult decision that you will never have to make. 

  
I simply believe in equality in a relationship. If you get 100% certainty that our child is yours, then so should I, and if you get to have 100% certainty that you wont lose anything important if we divorce, then so should I.

1fjszld,CMV: I have very little sympathy with Hezbollah with regards to the exploding pager attacks,"I'm sure you've all seen the news by now, that a few thousand Hezbollah-owned pagers have exploded in Lebanon, causing wide-ranging injuries (and a small number of deaths) to the people who were using those pagers.

Israel have not commented on this incident, but for the sake of this argument, I'm going to assume that it was organised and carried out on behalf of (or directly by) Israel.

The background for this is, of course, the war which has been raging since October. After the Hamas attacks in Israel, Israel have been conducting a war in Gaza, in and around the south of Israel.

Israel were not fighting against Hezbollah at this time. They were in the south of Israel, fighting with Hamas. But Hezbollah chose to join the war. They chose to fire rockets at the north of Israel. They chose to bring the war to the north. That is the first reason why I have little sympathy for Hezbollah right now. But I'm also aware that the fighting did not start in October last year, there is a long and complicated history to the fighting, and the relationships between the many parties involved are complex. So I don't think that this argument is, in itself, enough to justify my position.

But my second point is that Israel, in attacking Hezbollah in this way, have done exactly what the international community have asked them to do. They have been widely criticised for their tactics in Gaza and the number of civilians that have been killed. The pager attacks have also affected a number of civilians, that much is true - but the nature of the attacks means that it was very deliberately targeting Hezbollah members, and doing everything possible to avoid impacting civilians. The number of civilians injured/killed will, I'm sure, be far less (by percentage) than in Gaza, or in any other war that has happened in recent times. The pagers were owned by Hezbollah members. The explosions were timed to go off when Hezbollah members would have been handling the pagers, not when they were left lying on a table in their family homes where family members might have been the closest person to them. This is an incredibly clever attack in that it targets a very specific group of individuals - it will have far less collateral damage than bombing, or attacks by ground forces, for example.

What will not change my view here is an argument that any civilian deaths are unwelcome. Of course civilian deaths are unwelcome, but that is not realistic when there is a war on. Of course we would rather that there was no war, but that is not the subject of this CMV. The facts are that there is a ware, that Hezbollah chose to join that war (or at least its most recent phase), and that this attack by Israel really does seem to be targetting Hezbollah members and minimising collateral damage.

What might change my view is anything that shows that Hezbollah were drawn into the war (the current phase of the war, since October 2023) by Israel against their will, or anything that shows that Israel were targetting civilians in these attacks. I don't believe that either of those are true, and because they are not true that I hold this view, but if you can show that either of those assertions are false it's likely to get a delta.",LondonPilot,203,1616,0.6000000238418579,0.2201722081857277,1726666585,/r/changemyview/comments/1fjszld/cmv_i_have_very_little_sympathy_with_hezbollah/,2024,9,changemyview,2024-09-18 13:36:25
1fnwlrq,CMV: “Racism = prejudice + power” misunderstands what racism is,"
I’m a leftist and this argument is used a lot by leftists as a way to brush off interpersonal racism against white people, but I think this is harmful because it unnecessarily combines the definitions of interpersonal and systemic racism, and it’s important to distinguish the two.

90% of the time people who complain about anti-white racism are full of shit but the right way to deal with it is to either ignore them or confront them on their argument directly. I think it’s fair to say that interpersonal racism against whites is less of a problem for a lot of reasons (either because it’s less common, it doesn’t tap into trauma in the same way it does for POC, or it has less severe effects because anti-white rhetoric doesn’t affect whites systematically). But because those arguments are more complicated and people don’t wanna take the effort to make them, they come up with this new definition of racism that makes no sense and just serves to shut up people who don’t agree with it.

If interpersonal racism is only valid when accompanied by systemic racism, asian americans who aren’t first-gen immigrants can’t experience racism, since they don’t experience racism systemically. Other racial minorities can’t experience racism from black americans since black people suffer from systemic racism in america more than any other group by far, and therefore have less power in society.

If interpersonal racism was defined by the existence of systemic racism, there would be no need to distinguish the two. But it’s really important to understand the differences between types of racism so we can be specific when talking about racism and discussing its consequences. If this means acknowledging that white people can technically experience racism, that’s fine and doesn’t contradict the struggles of racial minorities. I also think turning the definition of racism into an equation is trying to “quantify” racism and turning it into oppression olympics which is always unhelpful.

I want my view changed because if there’s a good reason for me to agree with the “prejudice + power” statement, I wanna know about it.",Ill-Cat4533,826,928,0.7599999904632568,0.207327856459072,1727128646,/r/changemyview/comments/1fnwlrq/cmv_racism_prejudice_power_misunderstands_what/,2024,9,changemyview,2024-09-23 21:57:26

I've noticed the police in my short lifespan go from hawking profilers to being so lax they will see a crime happening right in front of them and just ask the perpetrator to move along. 

I go to the grocery store almost every day and over the last few years I've noticed the influx of people just walking In and walking out with shopping carts loaded with food and booze. The workers tell me the police won't do anything unless it's a felony charge. 

So now they have their own ARMED security and even they can only do so much without a threat of violence.

From my perspective, Trump has all of the bad qualities of a politician with none of the good. He's a pathological liar, he's obsessed with power (to the point where he wanted to stop counting votes when he was winning, despite numerous news sources explicitly saying there was a high possibility of a red mirage.) He keeps claiming voter fraud, but does not have enough evidence to get a case in front of a court. When the team picked by him- the cyber ninjas- counted the votes themselves they found *more* votes for Biden.

Until recently, I believed there was no way people were in an enormous cult. And the idea that they are is terrifying, because history has shown that cult members will sacrifice a great deal for their leaders. But I really just do not see another explanation.

1fgobko,"CMV: If you support Trump, you don't care about our country","With all the information out there, I don't understand how anybody could support Trump if they have the countries best interests in mind. My biggest issue with Trump is the Jan 6th insurrection and fake elector scheme in which he tried to essentially overrule the will of the voters and the constitution.

Not only does he not regret anything that happen that day, but he still doesn't admit he lost and just continues to lie saying the election was stolen (there is no evidence of such). He also wants to pardon the Jan 6th rioters, he hired a VP in Vance who said he WOULD NOT have certified the vote if he was in Mike Pence's shoes which would have meant overruling the guardrails holding our democracy in place. He is also saying that THIS upcoming election is already rigged, so why does anybody give him the benefit of the doubt that he would put the constitution above his own selfish interests in any scenario? This is also a man who threatens to jail anybody who participated in the 2020 election ""fraud"" in which he lost every single court case and there is no evidence. Moreover the supreme court ruling essentially giving presidents immunity is very disconcerting to me.

How can any voter in good conscious vote for someone like Trump knowing this? I'm not even going to get into Trump rhetoric and obvious selfishness because I think my view is strong enough just based on the Jan 6th/Fake elector scheme event.

1fc3l7o,cmv: there is no reason sex work should be illegal,"The number 1 argument against it is that there is a potential for sex trafficking, but this doesn't mean you ban the practice as a whole, the logical next step is that you make the job safer (which could be better done if it was regulated), not ban it unless inherently the position had some aspect of sex trafficking to it, , we wouldn't and don't apply this logic to most other facets of life, (don't drive cars because you could die in a car crash), and especially not other jobs, the reason it's illegal can't be solely based on how much harm it causes. 

The second most common argument is that it is inherently coercive, that the sex worker is inherently in a lesser position of power, and it is not completely consensual from both sides, in this case, I don't know why sex would be someone magically different than any other scenario where some inherent aspect of the person is being used for monetary gain (ignoring the fact that sex work isn't entirely based on the body of the worker anyway).

1fd3qbw,"CMV: Regardless of where you stand on the abortion debate, the ""unborn"" should always have fewer rights than those who are born. ","I think it's ridiculous that anyone thinks the rights of the ""unborn"" should even come close to the rights of the born. People in my conservative family and hometown all firmly believe that unborn embryos and fetuses deserve the same rights as born babies. To me, the issue can be simplified by a very simple thought experiment. 

*You find yourself in a fertility clinic that is burning down. You estimate that you have about 5 minutes to escape. You're standing next to a random toddler that's looking at you for help. You are also aware of 50 frozen embryos nearby and you know you can save a few of them if you hurry, but you can't carry very many if you're also carrying the toddler. You see three choices and have to act quick, which one do you choose?*

*1. Pick up the toddler and run out of the building as fast as you can*

*2. Pick up the toddler and try to save as many frozen embryos and run out of the building as fast as you can*

*3. Try to save as many frozen embryos as possible and leave the toddler behind*

To me, the **only** sane answer is 1. You pick up the toddler and run out of the building as fast as you can. If I chose option 2, I would be risking the toddler's life as well as my own for what I consider an unnecessary risk. Even stopping to save a single frozen embryo (and ensure it is properly stored so it does not thaw out) means precious time lost and potential smoke inhalation for the toddler and me. 

If I choose option 3, I am responsible for the death of the born person no matter how many frozen embryos I save. 

I have posed this scenario to many of my conservative family members and none of them are willing to answer the question and inevitably go off topic. 

I believe that any sane person would always prioritize the safety of the born person. Yet I see very passionate arguments from conservatives about the rights of the unborn, as if the unborn were truly just as human as a born person. 

I am not denying that an unborn embryo or fetus deserve some dignity, that's why we have laws against endangering the unborn. But my real issue is this pervasive idea that the unborn are equal to the born. We can argue about the unborn being ""50%"" or ""80%"" or on a sliding scale of equality as they get closer to being born, but at no point, in my view, does an unborn person have 100% the same value as a baby who is being born right now or is already born.

Violent sexual assault isn’t like other crimes. Most people aren’t going to therapy for years after getting smacked in the face by their parent or sibling as a 6 year old. Many people that were molested, even once, spend years dealing with the fallout from that moment well into adulthood. 

It’s because for most humans sex means profound vulnerability. It’s tied up with our identity, our attractiveness and our emotions in a deeply fundamental way *most* jobs we work don’t. 

I’m very pro capitalism for most things but seeing how even **non-sex** related jobs can be twisted into bizarre, abusive playgrounds for predators. Think Hollywood or the endless yoga/spiritual clubs that turn into fronts for sex work. With the right incentives people can and will pressure, this time with the law on their side, vulnerable men and women into physically or emotionally abusive situations so the whorehouse makes their bottom line by the end of the year. 

And the downstream effects of that normalization would be catastrophic in my opinion. ",nowlan101,794,610,0.7300000190734863,0.1649080222667275,1727473908,/r/changemyview/comments/1fqz4j6/cmv_sex_work_will_always_be_different_from_other/,2024,9,changemyview,2024-09-27 21:51:48
1f88sgx,CMV: a one state solution is the worst resolution to the Israeli palestinian conflict ,"
The Nakba was a horrible event, and the occupation and blockade of Gaza have been a complete disaster. The suffering on both sides is appalling, and a ceasefire should have happened ages ago. Frankly, the people responsible for war crimes on either side need to be held accountable under international law. There’s no excuse for allowing this violence to continue unchecked.

Now, about this idea of a one-state solution seriously? It’s hard to picture two groups who’ve been at each other’s throats for decades suddenly living together in one happy state. The level of hatred and mistrust between Israelis and Palestinians isn’t something that just disappears because someone draws new borders. Trying to force them into a single state feels like a recipe for disaster.

The demographics alone would be a nightmare. Depending on the immigration, one group is bound to end up with more power than the other. Whether it’s Jews or Arabs, one side will inevitably dominate politically, economically, and socially, which is just going to fuel even more resentment. And honestly, the last thing this conflict needs is more reasons for people to feel oppressed or sidelined.

In the end, a one-state solution seems like one of the worst ideas out there. The violence wouldn’t magically go away. In fact, it would probably get worse. Both sides have lost too much, and there’s way too much bad blood to think that merging them into a single state would work. Any real solution has to acknowledge their differences and deal with the core issues, not just mash them together and hope for the best",Successful_Job_1371,298,1059,0.6700000166893005,0.163094325521183,1725391418,/r/changemyview/comments/1f88sgx/cmv_a_one_state_solution_is_the_worst_resolution/,2024,9,changemyview,2024-09-03 19:23:38
1f9xjku,CMV: Affair partners have virtually no culpability when infidelity occurs; the blame belongs solely to the cheater.,"I was surprised to find this stance contentious in a couple threads recently.

If someone cheats on their SO, they have committed violated the trust of their SO. The person they cheated *with* however, had no covenant or commitment to the cheater's SO and they had no obligation to enforce the cheater's own commitments.

The AP's actions *enabled* harm to the SO, but unless the AP and SO had some relationship independent of the cheater, I don't see any reason they deserve blame or contempt for that.

We all do things knowing they will cause harm to strangers every day, it's unavoidable to live in the modern world without helping other people and corporations cause harm to strangers all around the world.

At the very worst, the extent of the immorality of an AP's decision is no greater than the immorality of buying a cell phone from a manufacturer that uses child labor, which is not something for which anyone receives much social condemnation.

* the AP does not have any relationship with the cheater's SO.",dishonestgandalf,445,871,0.6600000262260437,0.1569347743701858,1725570479,/r/changemyview/comments/1f9xjku/cmv_affair_partners_have_virtually_no_culpability/,2024,9,changemyview,2024-09-05 21:07:59

1fj9b69,CMV: The view “abortion should be illegal except for cases of rape” is impossible to actually have as a policy in practice.,"Let’s assume every single woman who is a victim of SA reported literally the same day and the man is arrested the same day. Even in this scenario, you’d be lucky to have your rapist charged and convicted within your pregnancy period, and if you did the baby would probably be almost born anyway. Evidence collecting, discovery, motions, trial, getting a verdict takes way more time than people realize. 

I know many of you are thinking “durrr let’s just expedite these trials.” First to that, it’s hilarious seeing the party that has prided itself on defending the rights of accused rapists take that stance, that we should just greatly diminish the rights of the accused and hold an unusually fast trial for one of the most serious crimes there is. Second, even expedited litigation wouldn’t fix the issue. Inevitably there will be disputes and issues before trial, court delays, and other things that push even expedited trials to 6-12 months after the offense.

I haven’t even taken account the fact that basically every rapist that is found takes a long time to identify and arrest, haven’t mentioned that only 10% of crimes are ever solved in the USA, and haven’t made any arguments about how unfair the justice system can be to rape victims. 

TLDR: we could never arrest and convict rapists quick enough (without greatly violating their constitutional rights) as to have a policy of abortions illegal except for rape.

1fdo64a,"CMV: ""white privilege"" would be better discussed if the termed was named something else.","Before I start, want to make this clear I am not here to debate the existence of racial disparities. They exist and are a damaging element of our society.

This is a question about how they are framed. 

I don't believe ""white privilege"" is the most fitting title for the term to describes things like the ability to walk down a street without being seen as a criminal, to have access to safe utilities, or to apply for a job without fear that your name would bar you from consideration. I don't see these as privilege, rather I see that is those capabilities as things I believe everyone inherently deserve.

A privilege, something like driving, is something that can be taken away, and I think framing it as such may to some sound like you are trying to take away these capabilities from white people, which I don't believe is the intent. 

Rather, I think the goal is to remove these barriers of hindrances so that all people may be able to enjoy these capabilities, so I think the phenomenon would be better deacribed as ""black barriers"" or ""minority hinderences"". I am not fixed on the name but you get the gist.

I think to change my mind you would have to convince me that the capabilities ascribed to white privilege are not something we want to expand access to all people as a basic expectation.",Atticus104,425,855,0.6700000166893005,0.1527035289387659,1725990698,/r/changemyview/comments/1fdo64a/cmv_white_privilege_would_be_better_discussed_if/,2024,9,changemyview,2024-09-10 17:51:38

They're as common as they are because the person making the accusation faces no punishments.

The common go to is ""this will stop women from coming forward because a lot of times you can't prove it"". This is a little slight of hand people use. It's not ""if you can't prove it you're going to be punished"" it's ""if you get caught lying you'll be punished"" those are 2 very different things.

It's also telling that no one else has this opinion for other crimes. For example if I have black neighbors and tell everyone ""I saw them break into my house and steal shit"" and then a month later go ""no, I was just mad at them and wanted revenge"" they would support punishment for those false accusations.

You have to have a really fucked up sense of justice where 1 person can make accusations and punish someone and then be let off the hook when they're caught lying. There's no justice for the victim at all. People will say it doesn't happen, but literally everyone knows a person who's life was ruined with a false accusation. So it happens enough that it's a problem.

And it’s likely that the very small minority that doesn’t is probably not gonna vote anyway. Are there stats on people who don’t have IDs because they can’t afford it? 

Furthermore, there are so many other sections of our day to day life that require having an ID: buying alcohol, flying, buying cigarettes, driving, buying a gun (a constitutional right).

The backlash against this just seems to me to be political division for the sake of political division. Republicans are introducing the laws and just for the sake of being contrarian, Liberals are opposing it.

1fq27tb,CMV: Death is terrifying,"For the longest time, the idea of memento mori has brought much meaning and compassion to my life. I used to like the ""sting"" of knowing that I would die one day and it would remind me to treat every day as a gift. 

While I do generally still have this sentiment, I think it was relatively easy to acknowledge that I was going to die, while still subconsciously distancing myself from the reality of death because ""I still have my whole life ahead of me"" and ""I'm still young"". 

After experiencing some health scares and getting a firmer understanding of just how fleeting our lives are, I've started to feel a deep dread, and sometimes borderline panic attacks, when contemplating death. The infinite void of nothingness. This amazing spark of life, then it's gone *forever*. I know that I won't experience being dead. But still, the idea of nothingness after death terrifies me.

To be clear: I am not looking for advice on how to cope with the fear of death. I am rather curious about those of you who think that death is not scary, and why you think so. Why am I wrong about thinking that death is terrifying?

1fpssmp,Cmv: You can absolutely be racist to white people,"I hate when people say that you can't be racist to white people. As far as i'm concerned it means ""i'm racist but i don't wanna take accountability for it so i'm gonna water it down to prejudice and use my marganalization as an excuse"" 

Let's take a look at some definitions of racism and go over them. This is the one you get by google. It comes from oxford languages.


""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.""

First of all. The definition clearly states that racism is typically experienced by minorities/marganalized people but not exclusively. If this was the case then the definition wouldn't have the word ""typically"" in it.

This definition also describes the fact that there are different types of racism (such as interpersonal racism and institutional racism) and white people can absolutely experience racism on an interpersonal level

I'll also go over a second definition by merriam webster

1
: a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race

also : behavior or attitudes that reflect and foster this belief : racial discrimination or prejudice

2
a
: the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another

b
: a political or social system founded on racism and designed to execute its principles

This clearly also describes that racism can manifest in different ways. With what was being described under section 1 would be called interpersonal racism and what would be described under section 2 would  be described as systemic/institutional racism.

People say stuff like ""you can't be racist to white people"" and ""black people can't be racist"" to justify/downplay hatred towards white people. I have even heard that ""hate crime against white people is not a thing"" BUT IT IS A THING. if you committ a crime against someone because of their race it is a hate crime and being marganalized and opressed is not an excuse for that

We need to stop giving BIPOC passes when they say something racist about white people. I see it on tiktok all of the time. I hate it when they call me ""palm colored"" just call me ""white"" or caucasian. I am not going to be anyone's punching bag. You need to realize that the mindset that one race is ""less than"" is exactly what created the system of opression in the first place and if you are truly serious about equality, BIPOC should be held to the same standards as white people. Not to a lesser standard. I honestly think saying that shouldn't even be controversial but here we are.

I can't find info on how Hamas handled domestic law and order before the war started, so I'm not sure  about point 11.   


However Hamas is obsessed with revanchism, which is the desire to reclaim land lost in a war.

I'm not sure what role revanchism plays in fascism, but I know if was a meaningful factor in the rise of the Nazis, who wanted to reclaim territory lost in WW1. 

Its a given that Hamas is authoritarian, but I think they are also a fascist organization on top of that. Someone prove me wrong. There are multiple definitions of fascism though, and they don't always align.

1fpsled,"CMV: Americans' current use of the term ""middle-class"" is a out of step with standard English and is a politically-motivated con.","In the broader Anglosphere, the term ""middle-class"" is used to describe the socio-economic class of households that enjoy middle-level incomes but also a suite of social practices. While there is no universal definition, many would include things like a university-level education, salaried position in a profession or ""white-collar"" job, travel abroad, considerable savings and job/financial security and so on.

In the US, the term ""middle-class"" has been co-opted to describe now something closer to what the wider world understands as ""working class"" - people who have paid employment, possibly shiftwork or casualised, often in blue-collar trades, with significant financial precarity. Many American sitcoms show ""middle-class"" (US-sense) families - like *The Simpsons*. A recent [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/02/15/middle-class-financial-security/) poll suggested only 30% of Americans consider a college education a marker of being middle class. This is not how the term is used in the UK, Canada, Australia (or other English-speakers in, for example, India).

The point of the term ""middle-class"" is to indicate there is an economic class ""above"" (in some sense) and ""below"". Using the term ""middle-class"" to describe people who the wider world describe as ""working class"" is a form of flattery (maybe) but also a piece of political theatre: ""hey, you're not on food stamps so you're middle class"" is a great way to deflect from people being systematically exploited in ways out-of-step with other English-speaking countries.

I am also an immigrant. In any roommate posting I've ever made, I posted details about myself, and then assessed whether the other person jived with me. I cannot fathom meeting someone who was a great fit, but rejecting them due to their ethnic background. I never thought to filter by race or ethnicity, since it felt so wrong.

**Summarized Opinion:**

* I'm not questioning the legality of the issue. I believe searching for a roommate on the lifestyle and principles you have is fine. You have to live with them after all. 
* **Stating your own characteristics in a roommate search are fine, eg:** ""I am from the Philippines, speak English and Tagalog, I am a vegetarian, devout Christian, 9-5 job etc""
* **Searching for a roommate with criteria that discriminates on mutable characteristics are fine, eg:** ""I would like a roommate who is clean, quiet, doesn't WFH""
* **Specifying boundaries isn't an issue, eg:** ""I don't drink, so prefer not to have parties or alcohol in the house. I'm a strict religious vegetarian, so we'd need to keep our food separate.""
* **Searching for a roommate using immutable characteristics such as ethnic background**, and by saying ""Gujarati Only"" or ""Chinese Preferred"" **is racist.**

People have said that listing all this out takes too long, isn't it simpler to list the one word that you know will match all your criteria, ie... **your racial/ethnic preference**? I feel like the 'culture' argument is being used to hide the poster's own xenophobia, and dislike of meeting or interacting meaningfully with other cultures. I feel like they're being excused due to being refugees/immigrants, and that it's a double standard. I am struggling to unsee people who act insular like this as being racially motivated, otherwise they would use the language examples above.

I am curious if this sub can change my mind. I'm open to understanding your perspective. I appreciate immigration and melding of cultures, and I was genuinely surprised when I felt the pushback.

1fon4ez,CMV: you cannot hold a biblical anti abortion perspective while simultaneously supporting the death penalty ,"So the title is pretty self explanatory. The Christian view of being anti abortion relies on the biblical view of “God is the one who gives life therefore he is the only one who can take life”. Using that biblical perspective you cannot also support the death penalty as god is not the one taking that life. The reason I believe this is there is a lapse in logic when saying one is somehow immoral because god says it is and the other isn’t. The Bible also stipulates that “an eye for an eye” is not a biblical view point. Matthew 5:38-39 says explicitly “You have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That you resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.” 

Something that can change my mind: explicit verses of the Bible that disprove my original assertion

Another logical reason that the death penalty (where statistically 4% people are likely wrongly convicted) is biblically moral but abortion is biblically immoral.

1frimcq,CMV: The stereotype constantly being pushed on reddit and other social medias that Gen Z has it worse than any generation leads to them disassociating and giving up on the hope of a bright future and will be far more harmful than anything the government will ever do/not do. ,"I was talking to a 21 year old the other day who was completely convinced that he was going to be subjected to a lifetime of financial and quality of life misery and he listed off all these reasons, blaming the government, economy, job market. He said he's given up saving money for a house and doesn't think he'll ever get married because the ""country wont be around long enough for it to matter"". After going on that rant, he goes on to talk about the 2 week trip to Europe he just got back from and drives a 2023 car and was wearing designer everything. I

 constantly see this narrative across all social media and especially on reddit that the ""system"" is broken and I don't think its a good thing at all. The government has always been shady, sleazy, corrupt, inept, and there is always something you can point at to place blame if you look hard enough. It's not an excuse to give up on your responsibility of your quality of life, or your moral obligation to try and make the society you live in a better place. 

Gen Z seems to have this attitude that it's not on them to fix anything and that the government should be responsible for their quality of life, and until that magic flip switches they don't need to take accountability for their bad decisions. This is leading to more and more Gen Z's stopping caring about the future, making self destructive decisions for immediate satisfaction, financially and otherwise which makes their lives worse, and then since they are miserable they want everyone else to be miserable, and anyone who isn't miserable got ""lucky"". I think when they get older they will be suffering the consequences of these choices far more than any amount of suffering caused by who is president, what dumb laws are made or not made etc. 

Despite all of the negativity you see on reddit the following are true and don't line up with the narrative that Gen Z has it worse than any other generation:

- Gun violence and violent crime in general has significantly decreased since the 80s and 90s. 

- Police violence has been stagnant, if not declining in the last 20 years. 

- The average IQ of people has increased several points per decade

- Wealth inequality is actually **decreasing** in the US, and decreasing even more rapidly globally

- The job market is basically back to average after the pandemic

- The average lifespan in the US is increasing significantly every year

- Women have far more opportunities and choices for career/lifestyle than ever before

-We are not at risk of overpopulation and natural resources are plenty and we are more efficient than ever at using them

-The worlds hunger problem while not solved, is dramatically better than it was 30 years ago. In the US almost nobody starves to death and those cases are due to severe neglect

Our parents lived through the civil rights movement, vietnam, the cold war, the dot com bubble, 9/11, the 08 housing bubble, the 2012 recession, they ate microwave TV dinners and now are dying of cancer at a much higher rate than ever before.

1g016fw,CMV: Being pro-Palestine is not antisemitic,"I suppose most of this line of thinking is caused by the people who want to erase Israel from the map entirely along with its Jewish inhabitants which is as antisemitic as it gets, so to clear up, I mean pro-Palestine as in: against having innocent Palestinians barely surviving in apartheid conditions and horrified by 40 000 people (and other 100 000 injured) being killed and it being justified by many / most of the world as rightful protection of the state. I am not pro-Hamas, I can understand a degree of frustration from being in a blockade for years, but what happened on October 7 was no doubt inhumane... but even calling what's been happening over the past year a war feels for how one-sided is the conflict really feels laughable (as shown by the death toll).  
  
I browsed the Jewish community briefly to try to see another point of view but I didn't expect to see the majority of posts just talking about how every pro-Palestinian is uneducated, stupid, suspectible to propaganda and antisemitic. Without explaining why that would be, it either felt like a) everyone in the community was on the same wave-length so there was no need to explain or b) they just said that to hate on anyone who didn't share their values. As an outsider, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it's possible that I hold my current views because I'm ""uneducated"", I have admittedly spent only a relatively short amount of time trying to understand the conflict and I'm not very good with keeping historical facts without having them written somewhere... but again, I reserve my right to identify what goes against basic human principles because it shouldn't ever be gatekept, so I doubt any amount of information would be able to make me switch 180 degrees suddenly, but there is room for some nuance. 

Anyway, I'm assuming the basic gist is: being pro-Palestine > being anti-Israel > being anti-Zionist > being antisemitic (as most Jews are in fact Zionists). I find this assessment to having made a lapse of judgement somewhere along the way. Similarly to how I'm pro-Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza, I'm not anti-Israel / Jewish people, I am against (at least morally, as I'm not a part of the conflict) what the Israel government is doing and against people who agree with their actions. I'm sorry that Jewish people have to expect antisemitism coming from any corner nowadays, as someone who is a part of another marginalized community I know the feeling well, but assuming everyone wants me dead just fuels the ""us vs them"" mentality.

1fzi81j,CMV: All transportation should be free out of evacuation zones. ,"Currently there is a massive problem with price gouging by airlines (supposedly now capped...) and it made me think...

If you are under a mandatory evacuation, you should not have to pay to evacuate. You are already likely going to lose your home. You may have no work to return to. You are limited in the possessions you can bring. And now you must also spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars just to leave? 

If an area falls under a mandatory evacuation and you live in that area, the government should be funding all of that. That should be part of FEMA to ensure everyone who has to evacuate doesn't need to worry about how. It would be easier and avoid fraud as well if we just did this up front instead of reimbursing people later. 

You tell the airlines ""there's a major hurricane how many people can you transport out of the area within X time"". Figure out how much it would cost. Create the guidelines for that many people. Do the same with trains and busses. If people are driving out (which should be a last resort because the more people who drive the more people who get trapped) the gas should be freely available. 

Any amount of ""fraud"" in a situation like this would be minimal. People will either pay to travel back or call it lost and stay put or travel somewhere else. You can coordinate with multiple airports/train/bus stations so that people get out of the hurricane zone to designated spots and they can either stay there or they can pay to travel somewhere else.

But they shouldn't have to worry about if they can afford to get out of the initial area. ",adhesivepants,5963,610,0.9300000071525574,0.6306209850107066,1728444000,/r/changemyview/comments/1fzi81j/cmv_all_transportation_should_be_free_out_of/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-09 03:20:00

I believe that there is absolutely no good reason for them to be there today and it can only be explained as celebrating the terrorist attack. They could have chosen literally any other date. Oct 7 is irrevocably connected to the horrors of last year.

I can see possible explanations like ""it was the start of the violence in Palestine"", but it really wasn't. On Oct 7 last year, there was only violence in Israel. The retribution came only days later.

1g8zgxy,CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal.,"I am not a conservative or a Trump supporter, I am simply tired of liberals now being seen as some kinf of ultimate good compared to the devils on the conservative side.

Malcolm x said that the White American who identifies as a liberal is the most ‘dangerous’ and ‘deceitful’ thing in the Western Hemisphere. He said that the issues concerning black Americans were raised by white liberals as part of a vicious power politics to get back at the white conservatives. In his own words, the liberals do so in order to gain power or retain power. 

This is fully seen in how the liberal of today talks about social justice and moral issues especially on Reddit. Issues that would traditionally be seen as important to liberals causes that affect minorities, and other contentious issues are thrown out the window as soon as it seems it may hurt the chances of a Democrat winning the election.

Malcolm said that conservatives are like wolves who make their intention to destroy you plain and compared liberals to foxes that hide their hand and plot when attempting to eat you. Many liberals on Reddit say things like if you even question Whether the democratic option is a good choice or matches your policies than you are aligned with fascism or don’t care about women/whichever other vulnerable demographic they can use as a card. This is manipulative and is reflective of Malcolm’s argument.

“The American negro is nothing but a political football and the white liberals control this ball. Through tricks, tokenism, and false promises of integration and civil rights…,” he remarked. Although he is talking about black people it applies to women, LGBTQ people, and more recently Arab communities. When it’s in fashion and low stakes, then it’s okay to criticize Israel for their crimes but when it’s election time we have to ignore all of their faults and behave as their #1 supporter.

Just finished watching the Trump rally in Butler PA… and I am astounded by how out of touch and disconnected it was. 

Obviously, Elon Musk speaking at the event is going to be taking up most of the headlines covering this event. If I were a member of Kamala Harris’ team however, I would be ecstatic about this. 

A major narrative that her team has been trying to create is that a Trump presidency would mean more tax cuts and deferential policy directed towards the wealthiest members of society, all at the expense of everyday, working people. 

Based on this fact, it seems really counter-intuitive for the Trump campaign to openly play into this obvious talking point that the Harris team has created. Musk has been outspoken about his support on Twitter… but speaking at a Trump campaign rally is a MASSIVE change. 

What would be the rationalization to justify making this decision, which I view to be a complete mistake… Obviously Musk didn’t just show up, this was a coordinated campaign event. Seems really strange for both Musk (who’s car business has always been heavily dependent on Democratic support for electric vehicles) and Trump to make this decision so close to the election.

1g76j7o,CMV: “From the river to the sea” inherently supports a Palestinian one-state solution,"In Arabic there are THREE versions of the slogan. TWO of which call for the “decolonization” of the Israeli state. These two slogans were infamous during the First Intifada: min il-ṃayye la-l-ṃayye / Falasṭīn ʿarabiyye (من المية للمية / فلسطين عربية, ""from the water to the water / Palestine is Arab"" and min il-ṃayye la-l-ṃayye / Falasṭīn islāmiyye (من المية للمية / فلسطين إسلامية, ""from the water to the water / Palestine is Islamic"")

The THIRD is the one that made it’s way into English, because it rhymes, and because it is the only reasonable one—it doesnt call for the recolonization of a Palestinian state: From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free""—the translation of min an-nahr ʾilā l-baḥr / Filasṭīn sa-tatḥarrar

So there are three slogans used by entirely different demographic geographically, culturally, and ideologically. Israelis are connected to western media, but also the immediate Palestinian sentiments surrounding them. They hear all three of these slogans. This is the true disconnect between all of these peoples. 

I often see interviews of people rallying say they support a one state, democratic solution. After all, two ethno-states where citizens of each do not have equal rights in the other would be the _definition_ of apartheid—supposedly what we are trying to end.

1fz67ym,CMV: Haiti is not a failed state but a victim of colonization and revenge,"With the recent tragedies going on in Haiti due to gang violence and the assassination of the i president many people on this site have referred to the country as a failed nation and asked what could’ve happened to bring them to this state. I think this is an ignorant position that makes light of history.

Haiti was a slave nation where people who were stolen from Africa were traded and made to work under threat of violence rape castration lynching and murder. When they orchestrated one of the first major successful slave rebellion, pushing back the French, and allowing for the Louisiana purchase to occur they were not only not welcomed into the rest of the world but brutally punished and forced to pay back “reparations” to the French. 

The enslaved people of Haiti were forced to pay money to the people who killed, raped, and enslaved them and this debt was not paid off for 122 years. Under threat of warship they were told to pay back more than 10x the cost of the Louisiana purchase. The equivalent of 20-30 billion dollars.

Thomas jefferson worked to isolate Haiti diplomatically and strangle it economically, fearing that the success of Haiti would inspire slave revolts back home. Haitian success was perceived as a threat to slavery in America for decades, and the United States didn't officially recognize Haiti until 1862, as slavery began being abolished.

The United States  worked to isolate a newly independent Haiti during the early 19th century and violently occupied the island nation for 19 years in the early 20th century. While the U.S. officially left Haiti in 1934, it continued to control Haiti's public finances until 1947, siphoning away around 40% of Haiti's national income to service debt repayments to the U.S. and France.

This means that while other countries were taking advantage of the various and exponentially quick technological revolutions, Haiti was trying to pay its way out of a fictional and racist debt “owed” to slave holders at gunpoint. 

If you add on the effects of natural disasters and the earthquake as well as the fact their president was murdered by foreign mercenaries. It makes sense that they would be in this position, and they deserve empathy not the designation of a failed state.

I live in Germany, in a city that has both a very large support for homosexuality and the lgbtq community, as well as a large amount of muslims. An overwhelmingly large amount of the muslims I met in my life have increadibly aggressive views on especially the lbtq-community and jewish people, constantly using their religion as reasoning for their hatred. I know that this problem isn't exclusive to Islam, but christians tend to have a much less aggressive approach to these topics because of principles like charity and taking a hit to the other cheek. Muslims on the other hand oftenly take a much more aggressive approach, presumably because of their principles of an eye for an eye and the high importance of the jihad. 

Furthermore, people from muslim countries tend to be harder to immigrate than almost all other cultures, because of their (depending on the school) strict religious legislation on the behavior of women, going as far as women not being allowed to talk to any people outside, leading to generations of people not even learning our language and never socialising with the native germans at all, in spite of many (free) possibilities to do so. Many also oppose the legitimacy of a secular state and even oppose democracy in general, because it doesn't follow the ruling of their religion, which emphasizes that only muslim scholars should rule the state. 

While I tried to stay open to most cultures throughout my life, I feel like muslims especially attempt to never comprimise with other cultures and political systems. Not based on statistics, but simply my own experience in clubs and bars in cologne (the city I live in), the vast majority of fights I've seen happen, have been started by turkish or arab people. I've seen lots of domestic violence in muslim families too and parents straight up abondening and abusing their children if they turned out to be homosexual or didn't follow religious rulings.

I know that this problem isn't exclusive to Islam, but barely any other culture is so fierce about their views. I'm having a hard time accepting and not opposing them on that premise.

Nonetheless, I feel like generalization is rarely a good view to have, so I hope some of you can give me some insight. Is it really the culture, or did I just meet the wrong people?",RetepExplainsJokes,1890,800,0.75,0.3297834863887621,1730160592,/r/changemyview/comments/1gehf05/cmv_muslims_and_the_quran_itself_have_too_many/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-29 00:09:52
1fzrumy,CMV: The UN resolution calling for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories in 12 months shows the UN has no real interest in peace,"Just to preface: I'm an Israeli, I fully believe that a two state solution is the only way for peace and that eventually Israel will have to withdraw from the west bank.

Last month the UN general assembly passed a resolution calling for the complete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories in 12 months, among other things. This is obviously completely impossible for 2 main reasons -

1. Currently there are around 700K Israelis living in the west bank and transfering all of them out of there in a year is simply not doable. It's not like Israel has cities, houses and jobs ready to accommodate these people. The toll such a massive transfer of civilians would take on the economy and probably military is just too high for such a move to be realistic.

2. Israel cannot withdraw from the west bank before it is stable enough to not be threat to Israeli security. Pulling the army out of the west bank would leave Israel's heartland completely exposed to attacks from militants within the territory, something Israel simply can't allow to happen as it would majorly compromise the country's security. This is obviously the main reason why such a hasty, one sided withdrawal is impossible. 

This makes this resolution, in my opinion, detrimental to peace and not the opposite. 

This is because it's a resolution that Israel simply cannot accept. The consequences of this will be that many around the world and in Palestine will have the idea that Israel continuously ignores UN resolutions reinforced and Israel will garner even more hate for it. And in Israel it feeds straight into the ""UN and everyone is anti - semitic and can't be trusted"" narrative, which only strengths and emboldens the nationalists and drives people away from peace. 
I also thinks this leads the the UN becoming less credible as what's it's point if it is pushing out unrealistic resolutions? 

In my opinion if the UN truely cared about achieving peace they would adopt a resolution calling for Israel and the PA to restart earnest talks about adopting a 2 state solution, and the fact they instead adopted this one shows their interest isn't peace, but rather virtue signaling and optics. 

Now I know some might say that the UN general assembly resolutions are non binding and it's more about sending a message and reinforcing international law, but I would still say that sending an unrealistic message is useless and causes more harm than good.

1ftufds,"CMV: CMV: Within legally recognized marriages, adultery should have clear, civil legal consequences, unless expressly agreed between spouses.","The legal concept of marriage, where spouses act as partners, is almost always built on mutual trust that certain aspects of the relationship, such as sex, are to be exclusive to the relationship unless agreed upon otherwise. Legally and financially rewarding spouses for betraying the trust of their spouse by allowing a cheating spouse to come out ahead in divorce undermines one of the key relationship dynamics in our society.

For the vast majority of people, entering into marriage is an explicit agreement that unless divorced or otherwise agreed upon, the people in the marriage will not have sex with or develop romantic relationships with other people. This should apply evenly to all genders, and if you view this as benefitting one over the other, it says a lot about your view on who may or may not be more likely to cheat.

Before I'm accused of being some kind of conservative or traditionalist: I have zero issue with any form of LGBTQ+ relationship or poly setup. I'm speaking strictly to traditional, legally recognized, monogamous marriages, which comprise the bulk of those in our society. I'm also not religious or socially conservative.

Heading off a few arguments:

1. ""The government shouldn't be involved in marriage""

Too late for that. Marriage is a legally binding agreement that affects debt, assets, legal liability, taxes, homebuying, and other fundamental aspects of our lives. The end of marriage has profound, legally enforceable consequences on both parties. It is also included in a pre-existing legal doctrine of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation\_of\_affections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affections).

2) ""But what if the spouses want to open their marriage?""

Totally fine. My post is in reference to the most common form of marriage, which is monogamous.

3) ""Adultery doesn't have a clear definition""

It does. ""voluntary sexual [intercourse](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=05826a3c56c67289&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1127US1127&q=intercourse&si=ACC90nwZrNcJVJVL0KSmGGq5Ka2Y_LZNCuz-rXf3RWbWGZD0YFuvQ0gck8iv_I-vXEsPMmDpeldPlTyUN0FJ6k9nx2_KAjj_QmEabPxsAQcdvs4E9R8NkyU%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_k-r92u2IAxVAMdAFHaqNGncQyecJegQIOhAO) between a married person and a person who is not his or her spouse."" ""Sexual intercourse"" would include all the commonly recognized forms of sex. This would have to be proven via the typical preponderance standard, which is greater than 50% odds, via typical evidence used to evidence behaviors - depositions/testimony under oath, any written or photographic evidence, circumstantial evidence, etc.

4) ""What should the legal consequences be?""

At the very least, immediate forfeiture of any rights to alimony or spousal support. Shifts in the default assumption of a 50/50 split of marital assets are another route to explore. Certainly not enough to leave anyone destitute, though.

5) ""What about children?""

Child support is a separate issue, as it affects the child, who has no say in one of their parents cheating on the other.",insect_ligaments,654,1145,0.6800000071525574,0.3000201815549924,1727805246,/r/changemyview/comments/1ftufds/cmv_cmv_within_legally_recognized_marriages/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-01 17:54:06
1g4khwz,CMV: The Israeli government and army are truly behaving like monsters right now,"Sources from the BBC state that there have been 3 hospitals bombed in the last couple of months, as well as schools being targeted in Gaza. A house has been struck with mainly women and children killed. 

There has even been (yet unverified) reports of a man being burnt alive due to a fire caused by secondary explosions and no evidence of any close by Hamas base. Even doctors without borders has verified this.

In Lebanon, buildings with babies and children are being destroyed and countless innocent lives are lost.

In the guardian, there have been reported of a 'very relaxed' approach to specific targeting - in order to bomb an area with a suspected low level Hamas operative, an exceptionally high level of 'collateral damage' is permitted. This is far different to Israel's previous strategies.

There have been, of course, many terrorists who have been killed. However, I do not believe this justifies the enormous amount of civilian casualties. If anything, this will achieve the opposite of their goals - any Gazan or Lebanese, after seeing their loved ones killed, will be radicalised against Israel even more.

Even the US, Israel's biggest ally, has been alarmed by the amount of aid being restricted in Israel and has even threatened to suspend some arms sales. The situation looks really bad, and it is becoming increasingly harder to be able to even attempt to justify Israels options.

1fz6425,CMV: Presidential Debates should have LIVE Fact Checking,"I think that truth has played a significant role in the current political climate, especially with the amount of 'fake news' and lies entering the media sphere. Last month, I watched President Trump and Vice President Harris debate and was shocked at the comments made by the former president.

For example, I knew that there were no states allowing for termination of pregnancies after 9 months, and that there were no Haitian Immigrants eating dogs in Springfield Ohio, but the fact that it was it was presented and has since claimed so much attention is scary. The moderators thankfully stepped in and fact checked these claims, but they were out there doing damage.

In the most recent VP Debate between Walz and Vance, no fact checking was a requirement made by the republican party, and Vance even jumped on the moderators for fact checking his claims, which begs the question, would having LIVE fact checking of our presidential debates be such a bad thing? Wouldn't it be better to make sure that wild claims made on the campaign trail not hold the value as facts in these debates?

I am looking for the pros/cons of requiring the moderators to maintain a sense of honesty among our political candidates(As far as that is possible lol), and fact check their claims to provide viewers with an informative understanding of their choices.

I will update the question to try and answer any clarification required.

1gdcgv6,CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round. They are mistaken. ,"Two years ago in the UK, a new front in the culture wars opened up when large posters exclaiming [""Hey straight white men; pass the power!""](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYiLQixX0AEUK03?format=jpg&name=900x900) were spotted in various locations around its cities, as part of a taxpayer funded outdoor arts exhibition ran by an organisation by the name of 'Artichoke' - a vaguely progressive body aimed at making art more accessible to the public at large.

Evidently, the art was designed to generate discussion, and due to its front page news level controversy, on that level at least it was an astounding success: with the intended message clearly being that 'straight white men' have too much power, and they need to hand it over to people who are not 'straight white men', in order to, according to Artichoke's own mission statement at least, ""Change the world for the better"". 

Now this kind of sentiment - that 'straight white men' (however they are defined) are currently in power, and they need to step aside and let 'other people' (again, however they are defined) run the show for a while - is one that seems, to my mind at least, alarmingly common in liberal circles. 

See for example [this article](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lily-allens-right-white-males-9562356#ICID=sharebar_twitter), which among other things,  claims:

\>""It's white men who run the world. It's white men who prosecute the crimes, hand down the jail sentences, [decide how little to pay female staff,](http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/women-20s-paid-less-men-9560167) and tell the lies that keep everybody else blaming each other for the world's problems""

\>""It's white males, worldwide, who are causing themselves and the rest of the planet the most problems. It was white males over 45 with an income of $100,000 or more who [voted for tiny-fingered Donald Trump to run the free world](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-followed-emergency-kittens-9549099)""

Before finally concluding:

\>""Let me ask you this: if all the statistics show you're running the world, and all the evidence shows you're not running it very well, how long do you think you'll be in the job? If all the white men who aren't sex offenders tried being a little less idiotic, the world would be a much better place"".

And this, at last, brings us to the crux of my issue with such thinking. Because to the kinds of liberals who make these arguments - that it's white men who run the world, and are causing everyone else all the problems - could you please explain to me:

How many straight white men currently sit among the ranks of the Taliban, who don't merely decide ""How little to pay female staff"", but [simply ban them from working entirely,](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-07-07/an-afghan-woman-wanted-to-be-a-doctor-now-she-makes-pickles-as-the-taliban-restricts-womens-roles) among [various](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/26/taliban-bar-on-afghan-women-speaking-in-public-un-afghanistan) [other](https://amu.tv/129066/) [restrictions](https://medicamondiale.org/en/where-we-empower-women/afghanistan) ? 

How many straight white men currently govern countries such as Pakistan, Iran, and Thailand, where the kinds of crimes prosecuted involve [blasphemy (which carries the death penalty), ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68511557) [not wearing the hijab (which again, basically carries the death penalty)](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/16/iranian-woman-dies-after-being-beaten-by-morality-police-over-hijab-law), and [criticising the monarchy (no death penalty at least, but still 15 years in prison)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/thailands-lese-majesty-laws-explained-in-30-seconds#:~:text=Under%20article%20112%20of%20the,majesty%20%E2%80%93%20anywhere%20in%20the%20world) ? 

Or how many straight white men were responsible for ""blaming someone else"" for the problems of any of those [various countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_cleansing_campaigns#2000s) in which acts of ethnic cleansing have taken place, on the orders of governments in which not a straight white man sat? 

Indeed, the article preaches against the thousands of white men who voted for Trump -  ignoring the fact that more [Indians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_2019_Indian_general_election)voted for Modi's [far right](https://jacobin.com/2024/03/bjp-far-right-modi-india) BJP, than there are white men in America \*at all\*!

Now; again, I must stress. NONE of the above is to say that straight white men have never restricted the rights of women, passed overbearing laws, or persecuted minorities. Of course they have; but surely it is more than enough evidence to show that NONE of those behaviours are exclusive to straight white men, and so simply demanding straight white men step down and ""Pass the power!"" is no guarantee of a progressive utopia-  when so many countries not run by straight white men are \*far\* from such? Moreover; does it not also suggest that ideology is NOT dictated by race, and therefore asserting that we can judge how progressive -or regressive- one's politics are simply by skin tone is ludicrous? 

Indeed, the whole idea that 'straight white men' exisit as a political collective at all seems frankly baffling to me; many liberals ironically seem to know the difference between Bernie Sanders/Jeremy Corbyn and Donald Trump/Boris Johnson (delete as nationally applicable) very well, and if straight white men do act in such a collevtive spirit, as liberals often allege, then how in high heaven did England have a series of [vicious civil wars, driven in part by religious sectarianism,](https://www.britannica.com/event/English-Civil-Wars) at a time when nearly every politician in the country was straight, white and male?!

Indeed; while we're back with the UK - even if all such people did step down, and hand over their power, we would still find a great deal of conservatism in the ranks of our politics; we may even find non white MPs standing up and demanding the [recriminalisation of homosexuality](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law), or even [persecution for apostasy.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34357047) Yes, many ethnic minorities are more likely to vote for ""progressive"" parties (Labour in the UK, the Democrats in the US), but this clearly does not translate to political progressivism on their own individual part. 

Now, a counter argument to my view here may be; ""But are you not cherry-picking the worst examples? Why do you not look at those non-white societies which, presently or historically, have been more progressive?"".

And I concede; ancient India may have been more accepting of homosexuality and gender fluidity than was the norm in (white) Europe - as were several Native American nations. But this too ignores the fact that, as today, non white societies in the past also ran on a spectrum of progressive to conservative: certain Native American societies might well have been gender egalitarian, even matriarchies - but many of the Confucian states in East Asia (particularly China) were perhaps even more patriarchal than was the norm in Europe. Indeed, they were certainly as apt at [warfare](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/atrocity-and-genocide-in-japans-invasion-of-korea-15921598/7EFEAB40BC9D61D2F9E92CF8C506FB70), [genocide, ](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/qing-extermination-of-the-zunghars/6D038CADD0F808459451175C1CAD6DC5)and [ethnic persecution.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/viet-nam-and-the-genocide-of-champa-14701509/6E8490A4C5670883A94DAD24BF5C899A)

All of which is to say, finally reaching my conclusion, in which (I hope!), I have effectively stated my case:

History, foreign politics, and even the attitudes of minorities within 'white' majority countries all suggest that there is no correlation between skin tone and political belief - and it is FAR MORE important to listen to what people actually believe, rather than lazily assume ""Oh, you have X skin tone, therefore you must believe Y, and surrender your power to Z who will make the world a better place than you"". 

Again, the argument I am making here is NOT that there should be \*only\* straight white men in politics, or that non white men are inherently \*worse\* at politics - I am well aware that there are many extremely progressive POC, as there are many extremely progressive white men. 

Rather, I argue exactly the opposite; that liberal identity essentialism is entirely in the wrong, and no one group of people are any inherently more progressive or conservative than any other - thus, simply removing one group from power is no guarantee of achieving progressive causes. 

I stand of course to be proven incorrect; and will adjust my view as your thoughts come in!",TenTonneTamerlane,1156,792,0.7300000190734863,0.2665242227138733,1730040057,/r/changemyview/comments/1gdcgv6/cmv_certain_sects_of_liberals_believe_that_simply/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-27 14:40:57
1g5y5nf,CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters ,"I was inspired to write this by an exchange I had regarding this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/s/E2Mj2dgkA8. As you can see the OP made a big hit. Over 1000 upvotes at the time I write this.

But take a second to consider the implications of that meme: it suggests that there are only two groups that exist in the American electorate —people who have decided to vote for Harris, and MAGA authoritarians. That’s it.

Now, I realize this was just a silly bit of fun, but I raised a question to other users on that heavily Democratic-leaning sub: is it wise to shame and ridicule people who still might vote for Kamala, especially considering that the election will almost certainly be decided by a extremely narrow segment  of the electorate? Does it make sense to mock undecided voters under these circumstances?

My concerns were met with scorn.

“I’m tired of swing voters! If they can’t figure out who to vote for, they should just stay home!”, said one.

“Swing voters don’t actually exist. They know they’re going to vote for Trump and just pretend to be undecided for attention.”, claimed another.

“I would hate to deny a person their right to vote but if a person can’t figure out why voting for Trump is bad…”

I am paraphrasing here, but only a little. What’s worse, I hear similar ideas from my progressive friends and I believe these opinions are common in left-of-center circles.

For example there was a post not too long ago right here on this sub where the OP expressed concern that Harris was not getting enough support from labor unions. I commented that the Democrats are increasingly becoming the party of the university educated managerial class and that they are losing wage earning workers in the process and I suggested that this was lamentable. Lots of people responded that the working class is mostly composed of bigots anyway so progressives shouldn’t seek their votes at all.

Now, that point of view is totally unhinged for a variety of reasons but I do want to say that I get why people are frustrated with swing voters.

Like, how can you be “not sure” about voting for or against a convicted criminal with authoritarian tendencies who endorses dictators and threatens civil rights? What kind of person would struggle with that decision?

But getting impatient is still not the appropriate response because despite what some Reddit users may believe swing voters are real.

There are people who voted for Obama, then Trump and then Biden and who have not made their mind yet about the 2024 election at this time. The key point for me is no matter how exasperating this kind of behavior might be, we need to try to coax these people to vote for our candidate and cannot afford to scoff at them publicly.

Statistically, swing voters are less educated and less politically engaged than hardcore supporters of either party, but they will decide the election. If a person does not want another Trump presidency, it is necessary to appeal to undecided voters. There simply aren’t enough Subaru Outback-driving, NPR-listening progressives (describing myself here) in the country—or in swing states—to carry the day for Kamala alone.

And like it or not, fair or not, there does exist a perception that Democrats are elitist college students and professors with nothing but sneering contempt for those without higher education. We can count on Trump and the Republicans to exploit that feeling to their advantage.

Making posts like the I referenced above exacerbates the problem. Even if it is at a micro level, the sentiment that undecided voters are stupid is widely spread and widely disseminated in progressive circles. And perception and feelings are more important than policy or facts right now, particularly for those “low information” voters who are going to decide whether or not Trump goes back to the Oval Office.

Under these conditions, I think a little tolerance and goodwill toward undecided voters makes strategic sense right now and I’m speaking to all of us who plan to vote for Kamala Harris.

Or maybe I’m wrong. Does it make sense to be openly scornful of swing voters right now?

I just want to say off the bat. Responses that say something to effect of, “What the Republicans do is even worse!” will not change my view. I don’t want the GOP to win so if they shoot themselves in the foot, I’m happy.

And if you do support Trump, I’m glad for you. I don’t. We can discuss him somewhere else.",BluePillUprising,568,1010,0.7099999785423279,0.2639011233082237,1729190685,/r/changemyview/comments/1g5y5nf/cmv_it_is_unwise_for_supporters_of_kamala_harris/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-17 18:44:45

1gdi4gm,CMV: Allowing children to become morbidly obese is child abuse. ,"As the title states, parents that allow their children to become morbidly obese are abusing them and should be treated as abusive parents. That includes CPS involvement and possibly loss of custody. 

In regards to the type of abuse, I believe that allowing a child to be some obese falls under “neglect.” Neglect occurs when a person responsible for the care of another person does not provide needed care or leaves them without care. In this instance, the parents are not providing the needed care, which I believe is a healthy diet/exercise regiment needed to maintain a healthy weight. 


While I think that enabling obesity could also be categorized as physical abuse because it causes bodily injures, I think that this falls short of the definition of physical abuse because there is a lack of direct physical contact by the abuser. With that said, I am open to a different opinion on this point as it could be argued that the physical symptoms of allowing a child to become obese is still physical abuse even if the abuser doesn’t inflict the injury with direct bodily contact. 

So how should this abuse be addressed by officials? First, CPS should be involved and allowed to investigate the reasons behind a child’s morbid obesity. If it does result from neglect, then the parents should have to work with professionals to address the issue. The cost of this care would be dependent upon the families financial situation. Failure to do so, and or failure to improve the child’s weight would result in a loss of custody. 

Maybe this is just crazy? Change my view.

1g5z1za,CMV: Trump supporters are largely delusional,"The MAGA campaign of recent years has appeared to me as increasingly cultish, with supporters seeing Trump as more of a God like figure, as an omnibenevolent figure in a world of lies constantly being fought through illegal means by the Democrats with little to no evidence, even circumstantial.

However, the way I see it is that the Trump campaign is built from a basis of lies and deception, from the blatant such as the Capitol riot and not conceding the 2020 election results to the more subtle such as the consistent talk of how loved he is around the world. Supporters seem to just believe every word out of his mouth, reading biased newspapers and dismissing all criticisms of Trump (while I accept some are false or blown out of proportion, a dismissal of all indicates a lack of critical thinking about who they support). 

In addition to this, the belief that Trump will not follow through even in small part with the Project 2025 plan also seems at least to me as deeply flawed thinking, with many leading Republicans of his previous presidency co-writing the incredibly detailed and controversial paper on a term Trump would serve, and with his clear desire for increased power through the appointment of Republicans to positions such as the supreme court (also based in part from his previous presidency). This flawed thinking stands out to me in particular in regards to Project 2025 due to its staunchly anti-abortion viewpoint, a view which [85%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/08/20/how-americans-really-feel-about-abortion-the-sometimes-surprising-poll-results-as-dnc-gets-underway/) of American adults disagree with (some more conservative estimates place this figure at [65%](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-trump-biden-election-2024-dobbs-498d14f6e2bbfe1f313f006ad089de4e)). This sweeping majority disagreeing with such a major part of the plan yet still supporting Trump shows blatant delusion and lack of research into the candidate of their choosing. In addition to this, when polled on Project 2025 just [7%](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-project-2025-broadly-known-severely-unpopular-voters-rcna172660) of Republicans say they feel positively about the plan. 

  
So all in all, I have trouble understanding what goes on inside Trump supporters heads, with the constant lies told (I understand that the Democrats also lie, but Trump is on a different scale), cultish behaviour and lack of research and critical thinking into the candidate who may run the most powerful economy of the world in an increasingly dangerous time, defunding NATO, banning abortion and destabilising the government whilst being incredibly unpopular in all other countries.",jkgill69,58,1129,0.5299999713897705,0.2466192124812503,1729192971,/r/changemyview/comments/1g5z1za/cmv_trump_supporters_are_largely_delusional/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-17 19:22:51

1g5ebf6,CMV: States shouldn’t simultaneously have no-knock warrants and a castle doctrine,"No-knock warrants allow law enforcement to enter a property without prior notification (knocking or announcing their presence).

Castle doctrine laws give individuals the right to use force, including deadly force, to defend themselves in their home without the duty to retreat.

Many states have some nuance with these laws but a lot of states have an overlap where they allow both of these to simultaneously exist. Texas for example has both.

This post is NOT arguing for one or the other but rather the fact that they both shouldn’t coexist.

If they coexist, it introduces a potential deadly threat to both law enforcement and the person defending their home and bystanders. In a scenario where law-enforcement gets a no-knock warrant and attempts to go through, the person can defend their home to this unknown intruder. This can of course lead to a gun fight.

Maybe this is a popular opinion but the fact that 30+ states have this overlap is mind boggling.",bernful,1333,550,0.949999988079071,0.2295456169576772,1729124755,/r/changemyview/comments/1g5ebf6/cmv_states_shouldnt_simultaneously_have_noknock/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-17 00:25:55

It draws attention to other places where the wall of standard/expected Dem support is cracking.

1g9o244,CMV: An abortion ban will only create more human suffering,"Banning abortion is going to create a lot more suffering, especially for kids who end up in foster care. Right now, only about 20% of foster kids ever get adopted, which means the rest are stuck in the system until they either go back to their biological families or age out at 18. For the 20% who age out without a permanent family, life gets really tough. About 50% end up addicted to drugs, and 1 in 5 becomes homeless. For the boys, more than half end up in jail, and for the girls, about 70% are pregnant by age 21.

That’s a huge problem, and banning abortion is only going to flood the foster care system with more kids, which is already struggling to keep up. The system’s broken, and we know that kids who grow up in foster care are way more likely to end up in trouble—about 80% of people in prison spent time in foster care as kids.

So really, banning abortion isn’t just about babies being born—it’s about putting more kids into a system that can’t handle them and setting them up for a hard life. If we care about reducing suffering, pushing more kids into foster care is only going to lead to more addiction, crime, and pain for everyone.",AmbassadorFar4335,595,726,0.75,0.205351379904845,1729618719,/r/changemyview/comments/1g9o244/cmv_an_abortion_ban_will_only_create_more_human/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-22 17:38:39
1g1hrt5,CMV: Wearing hairstyles from other cultures isn’t cultural appropriation ,"Cultural appropriation: the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society

I think the key word there is *inappropriate*. If someone is mocking or making fun of another culture, that’s cultural appropriation. But I don’t see anything wrong with adopting the practices of another culture because you genuinely enjoy them.

The argument seems to be that, because *X* people were historically oppressed for this hairstyle, you cannot wear it because it’s unfair.

And I completely understand that it IS unfair. I hate that it’s unfair, but it is. However, unfair doesn’t translate to being offensive. 

It’s very materialistic and unhealthy to try and control the actions of other people as a projection of your frustration about a systemic issue. I’m very interested to hear what others have to say, especially people of color and different cultures. I’m very open to change my mind.

EDIT: This is getting more attention than I expected it to, so I’d just like to clarify. I am genuinely open to having my mind changed, but it has not been changed so far. 

Also, this post is NOT the place for other white people to share their racist views. I’m giving an inch, and some people are taking a mile. I do not associate with that.

1geu08a,"cmv: If you’re voting for Jill Stein you’re a privileged person that has nothing to lose, and you don’t care about Palestinians more than you care about your moral high ground","1. Downplaying what’s a stake here doesn’t make it any less true. You’re either a white privileged person with nothing to lose, or so you think. 

It’s not too far off to imagine an autocratic term if Trump wins.

He has admitted that if Christians vote for him, they won’t have to do it again. 

You can try to downplay what Trump says as much as you want, but the truth is, he already tried to diminish our democracy, and he will do it again, he already said he won’t concede.

Here’s what at risk:

1. Mass deportation, including people from muslim countries and Palestinian refugees. This includes getting rid of birthright citizenship. And yes, this is anti constitutional, but Trump was given the power to commit literal crimes under the pretension of “official orders” with no consequences. Who is to say he won’t try to stay power any longer when his term is up?

*“[The court’s decision ensures that future presidents — including Trump himself should he win reelection in November — will know that they can escape criminal accountability for blatantly criminal acts, no matter how corrupt. Even acts that strike at the heart of our democracy, like resisting the peaceful transition of power, could not be prosecuted.](https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/supreme-court-grants-trump-future-presidents-a-blank-check-to-break-the-law)”*

2. Even more scary, with the 3 justices Trump appointed, they already overturned roe v. wade (let’s be clear, saying “it’s back to the states” is a word salad because NO ONE asked for this. Majority of people want to support abortion on a federal level, even republicans). With another Trump term, there is a chance he might appoint 3 more, for at least 30 years we could have a Republican majority in the Supreme court. With the 3 he already instated he was already able to find criminal immunity as a president and getting rid of abortion  as a right nationwide, who is to say he won’t try to do more?

3. If Jill Stein cared about Palestine, she wouldn’t try to take away votes from Kamala and she wouldn’t tell people “if you don’t vote for me, vote for Trump”. To Netanyahu, it is 100000x more convenient if Trump is president rather than Kamala, why is that? and if so, why would Jill Stein prefer someone who’s in bed with both a P*tin and Netanyahu? (not like she isn’t in bed with P*tin herself)

Aaron David Miller said: “He (Netanyahu) needs Donald Trump. And he needs the Republican Party. He's got to hedge his bets.”

4. Even if Jill Stein got “some” votes, the 5% thing is something that ONLY she pushes. There is no law that says that you need 5% to be a legitimate party, it’s a made up number to sabotage the election. She only shows up against female candidates to take votes from them, feels a but misogynistic and opportunistic if you ask me. If she actually cared about Palestine, she’d run small in local politics and tried to push change from there (like AOC does) this is more about her than it is about Palestine. 

5. If Trump wins, you might not get a chance to do anything for Palestine. 6 Supreme court judges appointed by Trump, cult following willing to do anything for this man, unwilling to accept the election results unless he wins (they’re already burning ballot boxes), unlimited power to do as he pleases under the notion of official acts, backed by Netanyahu and P*tin… realistically, either Trump or Kamala will win.

1gewuha,CMV: Dating preferences shouldn’t be considered wrong for people to have ,"This is mostly a social media thing but social media makes it’s way into real life. I’ve noticed over the years people have been against certain preferences, and to me I don’t see a problem with having preferences in your dating life. As long as you aren’t saying people who aren’t your preference are objectively less than, and we can admit that everyone has their own taste. I’ve seen people say if you wouldn’t date someone at all it’s a requirement not a preference, and to that I do agree but preference is kind of a euphemism many times in this case

But if someone only dates white people, let them who cares. It doesn’t affect anyone else, as long as they don’t shit on other races. If someone doesn’t wanna date fat people, then so what? As long as they aren’t insulting people who cares? If someone doesn’t wanna date a person with a high body count or who is a SW, as long as they don’t talk down on those people. I may only like chocolate icecream and never eat vanilla, but that doesn’t mean I’m going around hating vanilla it means I wouldn’t eat it myself.

Also I see a lot of people have an issue with this because they view it as a prejudice, and in a way dating is inherently predjudice but people feel like it shouldn’t be towards things someone can’t change. But this obviously isn’t the case. Plenty of people say they want a “smart” partner, but people can’t change their IQ. If you want a partner with similar interests to you is that fair if someone can’t control what’s interesting to them or not? Dating is inherently judging someone to see if they meet your standards of dating and there’s nothing wrong with that as long as your judgements don’t go past would I personally want to be in a intimate relationship with this person.",Accomplished-Fix1204,314,761,0.6899999976158142,0.1892840611321565,1730214400,/r/changemyview/comments/1gewuha/cmv_dating_preferences_shouldnt_be_considered/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-29 15:06:40

This will precipitate a death spiral, where homeowners start to realize that buying or owning a home in Florida is not a good investment and they'll leave the state. Supply will increase as demand falls. 

I will add one caveat here and it's that the federal government could step in and rescue Florida through a subsidized insurance scheme, but the politics of this are really iffy. Republicans would be most incentivized to save the state, but such intervention is also against Republican orthodoxy.

1g9zjx6,CMV: Women who require men to pay/support them when dating are inherently going against feminism and equality movement and is extremely harmful to dating culture,"As the title states, I believe women that require the men to pay for them if they want to be in a relationship are inherently against the equal rights movement for women. I want to first clarify what I mean by ""paying for them"". A large notion of dating culture is that men are supposed to pay for dates, rents, bills, and financially support the women in order to be seen as a romantic partner and a real man. This belief directly goes against the idea of equal rights between genders as it infantilizes women. It also feeds into the stigma held by men against all forms of feminism that women only want equal rights when it benefits them as they want to have all the positive aspects of an equal relationship while also having the upside of having your entire life financed by your partner. I also believe that it is hypocritical to believe that you are in an equal relationship if you are being completely supported by your male partner. This belief also severely impacts dating for any men who are not in a financial state to be fully paying for another person. For example any low income groups, college students. It basically makes it seem like you have to be rich enough to ""buy"" a date and a relationship. I have heard the counter argument that feminism is about being able to choose to be in this type of relationship. Before I address this I want to be clear, if you want to be in a trad relationship, go for it, however you both people have to take the traditional roles. However, choosing to be financially supported while being in an equal rights relationship and while having your own career is essentially infantilizing yourself in the relationship. You are basically stating you want a ""father"" not a partner. This is the same version as men who make their partner do all the housework while the wife also has a career. In summary, I believe that women who want to be in a modern and equal relationship while having the men to support you financially are hypocrites. An equal relationship is one that splits finances, housework, and all other aspects of the relationship according to what makes sense to that relationship. This unequal relationship causes a lot of negative effects to overall dating culture",lordamir008,392,669,0.6800000071525574,0.1761241790470212,1729649376,/r/changemyview/comments/1g9zjx6/cmv_women_who_require_men_to_paysupport_them_when/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-23 02:09:36
1gangu3,CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party,"The word ""fascism"" gets thrown around as a slur nowadays, but it was a mainstream, popular movement for a good chunk of the last century. 

* Donald Trump's former chief of staff (Mark Kelly), along with the highest-ranked military officer who served under Trump (Mark Milley), have both said on-record that the leader of the Republican party [is a fascist](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-kelly-swinging-trump/story?id=115061457).
* A leading historian of fascism, [Robert Paxton](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/magazine/robert-paxton-facism.html) (paywall, sorry), recently adopted this view and said it goes beyond the party's leader: ""It's bubbling up from below in very worrisome ways, and that's very much like the original fascisms. It's the real thing. It really is.""
* Umberto Eco, who lived in fascist Spain, defined ""[Ur-Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur-Fascism)"" in a 1995 essay as a collection of attributes that pretty much match the modern Republican party. 

I don't personally know anyone who *self-identifies* as ""fascist"" in real life. But they are not hard to find on the internet. If you go to the largest neo-nazi site on the internet, which I won't link to for obvious reasons, you will see news stories that mostly resemble mainstream Republican talking points about how immigrants and Democrats are ruining America. While some self-identified fascists are sitting out the election, most seem to be voting Republican (and as far as I can tell exactly zero are voting for Democrats). 

One big difference seems to be that the Republican party isn't antisemitic while most self-identified fascists are.

1g0rxgr,"CMV: Iran is not the greatest adversary of the United States, and saying so is a pretty brazen absurdity that demonstrates Israel's outsized influence on the country.","Iran being the ""greatest"" enemy of the United States was a statement Kamala Harris made to the press when asked about who the United States greatest adversary was, for some context, but its a statement that could just as easily of come from a Republican's mouth. 

Russia and China both have stronger militaries and stronger espionage capabilities that are currently in use in the United States. Russia in particular has strong influence over US elections in a way that Iran just doesn't. Russia's attack of Ukraine is also more of an existential threat to the West and the United States alliances and strategic interests, but China's threat to Taiwan is also important, and even a conventional war with China would be disastrous for all parties involved. 

Iran doesn't have these kinds of capabilities, and is in part propped up by Russia, so even if we pretended that the US' most vital interests were in the Middle East (Which they aren't, and both Biden and Obama has wanted to get out of the region and refocus towards Asia), Iran is still largely a Russia proxy, indicating that the real threat is Russia. Iran has less than a fourth of the GDP of Russia and around half the population. Iranian proxies limited to the region, whereas Russia has proxies all around the globe and their influence extends into South America, putting them far more into the US' sphere of influence. What Iran is, is the greatest adversary of Israel, as it and its proxies operates primarily within Israel's sphere of influence while having a solely negative relationship with Israel (Whereas Russia, Iran's backer, has a more complicated relationship with Israel where they are not adversaries).

1fuof4o,"CMV: Piracy isn't immoral, Nor is the damage from it as big as people make it out to be.","- ""If buying isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing.""

We've all heard this phrase countless times, and that's what i wanna dive into here. Companies have been and continue to get greedier by the second, and they've started to completely disregard people's conditions when it comes to acquiring a product. Streaming services deliberately serve you ads on their lower tier subscriptions in order to get you to upgrade (giving ads to paying customers is ridiculous), certain game stores have shit regional pricing or don't have it at all, game companies continue to include DRM software that damages the experience of the paying customers (cough cough, denuvo) and completely fucks up the experience of paying customers. Let's not even get into Nintendo and their abuse of the copyright system, i'll leave it for another post.

Not only is piracy these days not immoral, its actually the only way some people can acquire something they want to consume because they don't have a choice. So one could argue it ends up reaching people that would've otherwise just not consumed the product: You're not getting someone who can't buy a product to buy a product. But through pirating it they may become a potential customer. But lets digress a little.

So you, yeah, the person reading the post. Lets say you wanted to buy a game. Perhaps you'd use an online game store like epic games or steam, right? Now you own the game, and you can play it. Simple and convenient right? Except you don't own the game. If you, for any reason, get banned from the platform or lose access to your account you'll end up with either one of two things: an excruciating headache from trying to get it back or no games at all. Oh, you say you're a paying customer and you acquired everything legally? Sucks to be you! (You're also subject to the service's longevity, ToS changes, bugs, online authentication, bullshit DRM integration... I mean at least take me out to dinner before you f-- me like that-)

...Nah, for real though. The difference between getting games these days and lets say, 20 years ago, is that you actually owned the game physically. Unless you were using your CDs to cut bananas or something, you just need the game console and the CD. Nowadays you basically need to have everything online and completely depend on the company and be subject to their online authentication for various games before you can actually play them. Again, making the life of paying customers harder for no reason. 

If these companies are extremely rich and they keep buying out or getting rid of competition (cough cough nintendo), keep flipping the bird to the customers and push us to do exactly what they want once they've monopolized the market, how is piracy immoral? Doing anything about injustices legally will get you slapped around by big time lawyers and legal fees, so it is quite literally the only way that we have to rebel against these companies and make them change the way they behave. Your support ticket #2131321 is not changing shit, but speaking with your wallet surely will, especially if more people do it. Piracy isn't immoral, and it is purely a service issue. Its born out of the greed of streaming services and game companies. I guarantee it'd drop by an astounding 99% if they were to just fix the fucking way they operate, but they refuse to. So i say, sail the high seas and find that One Piece! Okay i need to stop... but anyways, change my view if there's something im missing here.

I'm just thinking about the point of the debate in the first place. From my understanding, it was to raise awareness about how unsafe women feel around men in general and that men need to collectively understand this and do better. 

Men though, aren't a monolith. I can't force a horrible person to stop doing doing horrible things and the average man can't either. We can work towards addressing subtle sexism, evaluating the kind of jokes we make and language we use to make everyone around us feel as safe as possible but topics like SA are very unlikely to come up in a normal conversation in a way that we can simply talk the 1% of men who do these things out of doing them. I highly doubt these people are active in such online spaces and engaging in debates like these anyway.

As such, the only effect this argument has had is to make a chunk of normal men feel demonized for acts that they've never personally committed (men have feelings that get hurt at times, shocker I know) and can't do a whole lot about unless something like that is happening close enough for them to physically intervene.

1fxg8rf,CMV: Trump supporters are in a cult ,"I’ve been going back and forth for a long time wondering if his followers are actually in a cult or if they’re just a misguided bunch that will one day see the reality and find out that this guy doesn’t actually care about them or the country in which they live. But here recently after the things i’ve seen i think the first option is more likely. Id love for this not to be true because if it is i’m sad for my country, but i don’t know anymore.

The reasons i think they’re in a cult: 

-Their leader does no wrong. It doesn’t matter what crazy statements their candidate makes or how outlandish his actions/comments are, they take it as law. He’s 100% right, no questions asked, and anyone disagreeing with him or criticizing him is “brainwashed” and “drinking the kool aid” 

-Any news/media criticizing him is “fake news”. First it was the obvious. CNN, ABC, and MSNBC. They claim these are “fake news channels” “communist propoganda machines” “paid by democrats to smear trump” and bla bla bla. Even if there is video evidence to validate the criticism, they think it’s edited or taken out of context. 

- Trump is the only source of truth for them. Science says climate change is real? No it isn’t, because Trump said it’s a hoax. Trump has made several racist comments in the past? No! He isn’t racist because he says he isn’t. Kamala Harris has always been Indian AND black? Nope! Trump says she “turned black” one day, remember? They take anything he says as truth and ignore facts. 

- Anything he says, or does is 100% justified no matter how dangerous the rhetoric is. 

Id love to hear another explanation. Id love to know that they’ll snap out of it one day, so i’m hoping to see some alternatives in the comments.

1. If you think people who make less should be paying less in taxes, just advocate that, adding complexity doesn't help.
2. It opens the door to more tip-based jobs in society. Surgeons will be making $2.13/hr with an expectation you tip 20% on your triple bypass surgery, and that be how they make their money. There's already an expectation to tip plastic surgeons. These large tips on expensive procedures being tax free will just continue us down the rabbit hole
3. If you want to incentivize people to work jobs like service industry jobs that are tip-based, the government shouldn't be the one doing it, the businesses should be. I would prefer business subsidies to businesses that pay their employees well over no tax on tips. This just perpetuates the cycle of businesses relying on the government instead of actually providing for their employees.

1g7c5b3,CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure,"Back in the 2010s, and especially in 2020, it seems like the Black Lives Matter was gaining strength. Videos of police brutality, especially against African Americans, became viral, and millions became outraged that this was so common in America. When George Floyd was murdered, millions justifiably took to the streets to protest against police brutality and racism. Politicians came out in support for police reform, and discussions on how to reform policing (from “how to make the police better” to “defund the police”) were all the rage.

But from 2021, it seems like everything took a complete 180. Crime skyrocketed during COVID (in part of police refusing to do their jobs in protest of BLM), causing the average American to support the police a lot more. Pro-police politicians like Eric Adams were elected while pro-BLM politicians like Chelsea Boudin were ousted from their positions.

Now, absolutely nobody talks about police brutality these days, not politicians nor the general public. But has the problem gone away? No! It has only gotten worse! 2023 has seen a record number of killings by police, and I don’t expect that number to go down in the future.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/08/2023-us-police-violence-increase-record-deadliest-year-decade

Unfortunately, rather than being addressed, police brutality has become like gun control. Someone being killed by police, even on live video, no longer elicits outrage. Instead, people will just give “thoughts and prayers,” shrug, and accept it as a fact of American life.

And the BLM movement itself?

1fzc2es,"CMV: The 2 state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is dead. Pretending it isn't is either naive, or a disingenuous stalling tactic.","Mainly because the West Bank has over half a million of settlers, plus another couple hundred thousand that live in East Jerusalem. The Israeli government isn't going to allow the dislocation of these settlers and turn them into refugees, and any theoretical Palestinian government will not continue to allow them to stay.

To me it seems a one-state solution is an inevitability, and it's just going to be a matter of whether or not Jewish citizens get preferential treatment and Arabs are treated as second-class citizens; whether or not it'll be a Jewish supremacist apartheid state, or a secular democracy and no longer a Jewish ethno-state.

I think Israel recognizes this, which is why it appears they're culling and dislocating as many Palestinians as they can and trying to get them all to move into Egypt so that when they annex Gaza; whoever is left will be a small and manageable minority. Therefore I think advocating for a 2-state solution is a counter-productive waste of time when what we ought to be doing is acknowledging it's going to eventually be a single state, and view Israel's actions in that context - that they're basically bombing and starving their own future citizens.

Not to mention we all have physical preferences with dating. Many people wouldn't date a fat person. Many women wouldn't date a short man. It would be odd if people didn't have preferences regarding skin tones or other characteristics associated with race.

Very few, if any, of our tastes and preferences are choices. I never chose to prefer vanilla ice cream over other flavours. I like chocolate cake but not chocolate ice cream, and don't know why. So it is odd to me that we people should account for their romantic preferences regarding skin tone.

Lastly, I will note that dating is nothing like a job or housing. Nobody is entitled to a partner. It makes complete sense to discriminate partners based on appearance in a way that wouldn't be appropriate for housing or employment.

The obesity rate has been climbing higher and higher year by year. This is not because of people having medical conditions causing them to gain this weight. Those cases have stayed stagnant.

People are fat because they eat a caloric surplus every day. Now, they might be eating the same quantity of food as people with a normal BMI. But it then must be extremely calorically dense. It irks me how people can’t see how it’s a simple science, excess calories & nothing to do with it = fat. 

Many people do have slower metabolisms, but it’s not slow enough where you can’t maintain a healthy weight.

1g11ks1,CMV: Trump supporters have no counter-argument to the claim that Trump's statements on lack of Hurricane Helene relief being contradicted by republican senators destroy his credibility.,"I have been looking for an argument that maintains Trump's creditability while also acknowledging his statement on the Helene relief effort, so far the only responses I have gotten are a refusal to engage with suggests to me that there is no response.

Trump has claimed that the federal government is doing a horrible job with Hurricane Helene relief. My understanding is that republican senators and democratic governors of NC has basically said that that is totally not true and they are getting what they need, basically fully approving of the recovery effort.

The obvious counter argument is to say this is just politics but the fact that republican senators are contradicting Trump on this seems to remove the possibility that this is just partisan mudslinging and that Trump just doesn't care if what he says is true.

so basically the situations is the 3 points (but what I want to be changed on is mostly just point 3

II. To lie so brazenly and so totally, it's not just a minor mischaracterization afterall, about  natural disaster relief while it is happening is such a shameless act of dishonesty that it fully destroys Trumps creditability to the point where he, and everything he said, can no longer be thought of as being grounded in any sense of what is true.  In short he just says whatever he wants either because he is a con man or because he is a delusional idealogue and is lying to himself just as much as he is lying to everyone else.

1g9xfik,CMV: The frequency of false rape accusations is an unknowable statistic,"A popular argument against addressing the issue of false rape (or sexual assault) accusations is that they are so exceedingly rare, that it isn't an issue worth dedicating significant resources to.  And that addressing the issue of rape and sexual assault is far more vital.

Various ""studies"" have been done to try to determine the rate of false accusations, and they typically conclude that somewhere in the range of 2% - 8% of accusations are false.  Some claim a lower number.  Others claim it is over 40%.

My view is that, because of the nature of the crime, it is simply impossible to get reliable data upon which to form a conclusion about the frequency of false accusation.  There will be some small percentage of accusations that can be proven (to a reasonable extent) to be true, and some small percentage of accusations that can be proven to be false.  And then you'll have a large percent - at least 80% to 90% - that fall somewhere in the middle and might be true, or might be false, but we don't really know to any reasonable extent.

In most accusations, there are only 2 people who know what *actually* happened and whether consent was granted, or even if sexual activity was engaged in.  If those 2 people's stories disagree on either of those factors - and they usually do - it is unlikely that we'll ever be able to reasonably conclude whether the accusation is accurate, or false.

The ones that could be concluded as true would include:

* Situations where video, audio, or eyewitness evidence of the actual act exists and shows that sex was had without consent.

* Situations where the 2 people's stories genuinely align, and the details of those stories indicate that a rape occurred, even though the accused doesn't think it should.

* Situations with significant physical evidence that indicates that both (a) sex was had, and (b) it is unlikely that consent was granted.  This would be rape of the ""stranger jumped out of the bushes and violently attacked"" variety.

The ones that could be reasonably concluded as false would include:

* Situations where video, audio, or eyewitness evidence shows that consent was provided for any sexual activity.

* Situations where the 2 people's stories genuinely align, and the details of those stories do not meet the legal definition of rape, even though the accuser thinks it should.

* Situations where the accuser recants their accusation, and there is reasonable evidence to support that recantation.  [Sometimes accusations are recanted because the accuser just doesn't want to deal with the situation anymore.  Recanting for that reason wouldn't be indicative of a false accusation].

There's probably a few other situations that could be definitively determined as true or false that I've missed.  But the overwhelming majority (80%+), are just going to be indeterminable.

On top of all that, there are additional factors that even further exacerbate the challenges of defining the frequency of false rape accusations:

* There isn't clear or consistent agreement on what counts as an ""accusation"".  Is it just criminal reports to police?  What about civil litigation without criminal prosecution?  How about Title IX reports to universities?  Or simply tell a friend group or social media that a rape happened?  At what point does it become an ""accusation"" that gets analyzed as true or false?

* There are inconsistent laws as to what legally qualifies as rape / sexual assault, and beyond the laws, there are discrepancies of whether the statistics are intended to represent just ""legal rape"", or ""moral rape"" as well - even if it doesn't meet the legal definition for rape.

*  If we're talking about ""moral rape"", people can and do disagree on what counts as rape and what counts as a false accusation.  In these cases, people could 100% agree on every detail of the accusation, but still disagree upon whether it was rape, or a false accusation.  For example, disagreement over where the line of ""too drunk to consent"" would be encompassed here.

For all these reasons, and definitive statement about a specific percentage of accusations that are true or false is simply unreliable.",JuicingPickle,137,546,0.6100000143051147,0.1284039945114788,1729643037,/r/changemyview/comments/1g9xfik/cmv_the_frequency_of_false_rape_accusations_is_an/,2024,10,changemyview,2024-10-23 00:23:57
1fvbizp,CMV: The reason the Iranian attack two days ago did not kill a single Israeli is not because Iran did not target civilians but because of Home Front Command guidelines and Anti-Missile defenses. ,"I've seen this take all over Reddit. I've even seen people claim that Israelis using the lack of casualties as proof the attack was unsuccessful as evidence the Israelis see success in warfare as the amount of damage caused to civilians. As well as conspiracy theories that the IDF is hiding the true amount of casualties. I think the evidence shows that the attack was meant to cause the maximum damage to military and civilians and failed due to the significant precautions the State of Israel has taken to protect its residents. 

Here's a broad rundown of events, this is basically a first hand account. An emergency alert was sent to phones across Israel and Israeli occupied territories before the attack and about a minute later once the rockets fired missile alarms sounded (except Eilat which is in the middle of nowhere). About 2 minutes later I could clearly hear loud explosions nearby which scared a dog that was sheltering with me. (So this was not targetted) About 40 minutes another emergency alert was sent that it was safe to leave the bunkers. I consider myself extremely lucky to be away from military targets, close to a bunker and under the protection of the Iron Dome. I understand that the West Bank and Lebanon do not and that Gaza is actually designed to put the maximum amount of civilians in harms way. Even a lot of Israelis don't have sufficient access to bunkers or safe rooms. Especially in the periphery where they need it the most. 

Of course we all know that Israeli air defenses were overwhelmed in the attack. That was not only known, but expected. Which is why bunkers and sirens are also used, and Israelis are well aware of the guidelines due to the dozens of drills we had to take during our life. There is this thing called the Swiss cheese model of risk management. None of the precautions alone could have protected the country 100% but together they ""cover each others holes"". Missile defenses create a lot of shrapnel which can be deadly. Bunkers can be poorly made or even locked or unavailable. People could be hard of hearing and not hear the rockets or just be apathetic to the sirens, leave the bunker too early out of boredom. The Elderly can often not reach the bunker fast enough. Also the push notification was written in Hebrew so Arabs, Immigrants and the illiterate cannot understand it. Some people don't have access to smartphones. Etc and Etc. 

The one mortality in the West Bank is a case of all the precautions failing. He ignored guidelines and instead watch the rockets fly and then was hit by shrapnel. Plus he was in the West Bank so he likely did not hear alarms or receive the notification and even if he did he likely wouldn't be able to read it. The last attack in April also had a single Israeli casualty, who was a little Arab girl sleeping in a remote village in the Negev desert with no sirens and no bunkers. Luckily she survived after intensive medical care.  

Now the reason I don't think the lack of casualties was intentional on the part of Iran is because of how much damage was caused to civilian areas. Hod Hasharon was hit the hardest where about 100 civilian homes were damaged and as far as I know there are no military targets there. A school in Gedera was hit but that's near a military base. Even Palestine was hit by some of the rockets which is why there was a mortality there. And 2 Jordinians were injured despite being far from any Israeli military bases. Nevatim Airbase was severely hit but all other military targets did not suffer as much damage as civilian areas. 

I really don't see how anyone can think that Iran had any concern for any civilians in the area, including the Palestinian Civilians who the attack was allegedly for. Trying to spin this as a success for Iran or a failure for Israel is inaccurate at best and disinformation at worse. Though if reasonable people think otherwise there's likely some merit to believing it. So CMV.

In fact when thinking about this, I have received countless solicitations and people telling me to vote, but not a single person has questioned why I don't vote.

all this to say that my view is that people need you quick telling black men how they should vote. We will choose who we vote for based on what we want to see, if we choose to vote at all.

I absolutely can't stand it now because EVERYTHING is made sexual and it's a bit predatory in my opinion because creators almost FORCE you to view them by gaming the algorithm. One thing I think IG user will come across is a woman who will be making very basic content like describing a news story or telling a trending joke. But the woman makes sure to perfectly position herself where her cleavage is visible because that's usually the only thing in her content that is actually of 'value'.  You see this a lot with IG comedians where the joke is ""sex"" or ""look at my ass/tits"". Like if you watch gym videos you've probably stumbled across one of the many female creators who use gym equipment to do something sexual and the joke is ""Haha sex"". 

But then, as expected, the comments will be split between peopple (usually men) sexualizing the creator and people (usually women) shaming the men for sexualizing her and being ""porn addicted"". But what really do you expect? When you sexualize yourself it shouldn't be a surprise when the attention you get is sexual. And I think that applies to all situations both in real life and online.

Now what I normally see in the comment is the argument that ""well she's a woman and that's just her body. She's not sexualizing it you are"". But I think this is just a cop out that takes away personal responsibility, assumes the women are too dumb to understand how they are presenting themselves and that the viewer is too dumb to have common sense. 

I also think America is so over hypersexualized that people will go out dressing like a stripper and be baffled when they're viewed as such. So yeah pretty much my view is the title that when you oversexualize yourself, it should be a surprise when the attention you get is sexual.

1gvch39,"CMV: Male circumcision is wrong, but calling circumcised men ""mutilated"" or implying that they are sexually dysfunctional is also wrong.","Basically, my understanding of the issue of male circumcision is that it is a bad thing, but only mildly so.  

There are statistically low risks of surgical complications, and even lower statistical risk that the complications could result in serious long-term problems.  The only studies that I have seen that claim that circumcised men experience more sexual dissatisfaction, discomfort or dysfunction, are based on online survey results which have low N counts and would suffer from confirmation bias.  The most convincing studies I have seen that are based on meta-analyses and medical data find that circumcised men are not more likely to suffer from sexual dysfunction or dissatisfaction than uncircumcised men.  

The trade-off is the purported hygiene and STD preventing effects of circumcision, which I understand to be questionable at best, and perhaps more applicable to countries where hygiene practices and conditions are not great. 

On the balance, it's not a good practice and it should definitely be discouraged, maybe even banned.  Especially when you factor in more abstract and unproven concerns, like the possible psychological impact on infants and just the abstract point of losing sexual sensitivity relative to uncircumcised men.

All of that being said, I don't think it is either logically accurate or rhetorically effective to describe male circumcision as a form of mutilation, or to imply in any way that circumcised men are sexually dysfunctional.  

I think the word ""mutilation"" implies that there are malicious and/or medically-arbitrary (e.g. purely cultural) *intentions* behind male circumcision, and also that the harm done is severe and debilitating.  I do not think that implication rings true.  I think most parents still believe that the hygiene/STD prevention reasons are valid, and a lot of doctors also don't know well enough to disabuse them of this notion.  And even if the parents due it purely for cultural reasons, as discussed above, the risks and harms of circumcision are relatively minor - parents wouldn't do it otherwise.  

I also think that telling parents that they are ""mutilators"" and circumcised men that they have been ""mutilated"" is unconvincing.  You are using more extreme rhetoric thinking that the fact that it is more extreme means it will have more of an impact, but really that extreme rhetoric just makes the whole position seem unrealistic.  

Especially when it comes to circumcised fathers, who are usually the ones to push for circumcision more than the mothers.  Tell a circumcised father that they have been mutilated and that their son's dick isn't going to work, and they will laugh in your face - because, of course they never considered themselves to be ""mutilated"", and of course they never had problems with their own dick working.  

Tell parents instead ""there's really no benefit to doing this, and there are some pretty severe downsides on the rare chance that it goes wrong"" - and they will be much, much more likely to be convinced.  Not to mention that you are actually telling them the truth, which is always better than lying to people via hyperbole.

1giv72i,CMV: There is no such thing as an ethical billionaire.,"This is a pretty simple stance. I feel that, because it's impossible to acquire a billion US dollars without exploiting others, anyone who becomes a billionaire is inherently unethical. 

If an ethical person were on their way to becoming a billionaire, he or she would 1) pay their workers more, so they could have more stable lives; and 2) see the injustice in the world and give away substantial portions of their wealth to various causes to try to reduce the injustice before they actually become billionaires. 

In the instance where someone inherits or otherwise suddenly acquires a billion dollars, an ethical person would give away most of it to righteous causes, meaning that person might be a temporary ethical billionaire - a rare and brief exception.

Therefore, a billionaire (who retains his or her wealth) cannot be ethical. 

Obviously, this argument is tied to the current value of money, not some theoretical future where virtually everyone is a billionaire because of rampant inflation.",jrice441100,1317,1773,0.6800000071525574,0.7198219601101508,1730662648,/r/changemyview/comments/1giv72i/cmv_there_is_no_such_thing_as_an_ethical/,2024,11,changemyview,2024-11-03 19:37:28

Please consider the following points before commenting:

1. The currency domination isn't important (it could be euros, yen, or whatever), but using USD as a benchmark.

2. A married couple could possess 2 billion dollars, so lets eliminate that argument at the start.

3. Choosing 1 billion is subjective, it could be 5 billion, or 500 million. I am picking this number to demonstrate that I have no problems with capitalism, nor am I advocating for communism, or that I don't acknowledge that societies in general will always have wealth inequality. 

4. I do hope this doesn't end up being an echo chamber, because part of this position does seem a bit 'obvious.'

1gkdy23,CMV: the stigma around men discussing their feelings is caused just as much by women as men,"My friend and I got into a disagreement over the weekend with our girl friends around the problems of men’s mental health. Their argument was that men don’t feel comfortable talking about their feelings because of the patriarchy that they have established. They argue that men self-impose toxic masculinity and this prevents them from expressing themselves fully. 

We responded by saying that women don’t want to listen to men’s problems. Their response was that women’s issues are more important because they have been historically wronged by society. The basic contention they proposed was that women face more oppression and a slew of issues fighting against the patriarchal society that we would never be able to understand. 

The underlying claim in their argument was that therefore men’s issues aren’t as deep or significant. To me, this literally proved our point that women tend to trivialize men’s problems.

1gk33fs,CMV: Islamophobia is not irrational,"First off, I’m not interested in comparing Islam to other religions in this post, this discussion is only about Islam, so please keep comments focused on that.

For context, I grew up in Iran around Shia Muslims. Most of the people around me identified as Muslim in name, but many didn’t strictly follow the religion, and some even despised it. Personally, I hold a very critical view of Islam.

From my perspective, Islam promotes outdated, unhealthy, and often bigoted ideas. While I know not all Muslims follow these beliefs to the letter, these aspects are deeply rooted in the ideology. A few examples I find concerning:

* Islam often promotes misogynistic beliefs that limit women’s freedom.
* It teaches intolerance towards homosexuals and apostates.
* It encourages violence against its enemies and places a strong emphasis on martyrdom and military supremacy.
* The goal of Islam, as stated in its texts, is to dominate the world as the true religion.

With these factors in mind, I think a critical view or even fear of Islam isn’t irrational.

1god8ad,CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding.,"My fiance and I live in a state that legalized same-sex marriage in 2010, when we had a Democratic governor and Democratic majorities in both our State House and State Senate.

Currently, as of last week's election, it is confirmed that our state will have a Republican governor, and a Republican majority in the State Senate; once all the votes are counted, it is all but guaranteed that Republicans will have a majority in the State House as well.

Our state's Republican Party's platform, as listed on their website,, states that their goal is to, ""recognize marriage as the legal and sacred union between one man and one woman as ordained by God, encouraged by the State, and traditional to humankind, and the core of the Family."" This is dated to April 13, 2024 - it's not an obsolete or outdated policy point for them.

At a national level, a 2024 Gallup Poll showed that only 46% of Republicans believe that same-sex marriages should be recognized by the law as valid. As in our state, the results of last week's election have given us a Republican president, a Republican Senate, and as it stands currently, a very high chance of a Republican House. 

Conveniently, Republicans now also hold a majority on the Supreme Court. In his concurring opinion on the Dobbs case in 2022, Clarence Thomas stated that the court, ""should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell"" - with Obergefell being the case that required the entire nation to recognize and perform same-sex marriages.

In summary: while it's not set in stone quite yet, there is a very distinct chance that, at some point in the next four years, we will become unable to legally marry in our home state, and unable to gain the financial and legal benefits of marriage if we were to have it performed in another state or country.

Because of this looking threat to our rights, we are planning on going to City Hall to get a marriage certificate sometime before the end of the year. At some point further down the road, we can hold a symbolic ceremony and reception, no matter the political situation at the time (we had been putting this off for cost purposes anyways).

When it comes to our guest list, I feel completely justified in instructing our potential guests that, if they have voted for political candidates who belong to the party that threatens our right to marry in the most recent election, then we ask that they do not attend our marriage. I cannot stomach the thought of enabling their hypocrisy, specifically their ability to perform acts that harm us one day, then show up to congratulate us and share in our joy the best day.

While we haven't outright asked everyone on our drafted guest list who they have voted for, it appears that this request would mean that at least, my mother, my grandmother, and many aunts, uncles, and cousins on my fiance's side would be asked to decline their invitations. I am fine with my mother and grandmother not attending, as my father and most of my siblings would be there, and I know that my fiance's mother and brother would be there as well.

My fiance states that, should I make this request, the resultant family drama on his side would be so tumultuous that it would tear the family apart, and he would never hear the end of it until everyone requested not to attend had passed away.

It is worth noting that, prior to my coming up with the idea of this request, his side of the family occupied about three times more of the drafted guest list than my side - he has offered a similar justification that choosing to invite some but not all of his family would cause too much drama. Meanwhile, I had only ever intended to invite my nuclear family, my one surviving grandmother, and the aunt/uncle/cousins that live closest by that I am on the best terms with.

So, what do you think? Is it worth causing ""family drama"" in order to take a stand against hypocrisy? Should I, instead, grin and bear the unwanted presence at our wedding of those who voted against our right to marry?",BosomsaurusRex,1287,910,0.7200000286102295,0.5262905747541151,1731278810,/r/changemyview/comments/1god8ad/cmv_i_am_justified_in_not_inviting_family_members/,2024,11,changemyview,2024-11-10 22:46:50
1gp868o,CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective. (At least in the States),"Now I imagine most people already know what the 4B movement is. For those that don't, it is a movement started by women in South Korea where women will be celibate, not get married, not have kids and not have sex with men. Sex strikes are just the latter part.

Now, this concerns the United States, South Korea I've heard plenty of horror stories regarding systemic sexism and thus can understand why those women perform this movement, but its strange when looking at the states.

1. Conservative men are typically very Religious, they not only preach against hookup culture but support celibacy for women and are extremely anti abortion. The 4B movement is everything they want out of women by preventing more abortions and not having sex outside of marriage.

2. Conservative men are not going to go out with more left leaning women who do not share their values, most of these men despise feminists and they have no problem with women they have no interest in not dating them.

3. No Conservative man wants left leaning women to procreate, why would they want more people in future generations to challenge their values instead of populating the future with children who subscribe to their views.

4. This hurts liberal men. Men who are feminists or are sympathetic to these women are far more likely to date and marry the women in these movements, and thus they are hurt by this movement, while nothing changes for conservative men.

In general, it seems like the 4B movement is self defeating and gives conservative men exactly what they want while hurting both left leaning men and women.

1h2li68,CMV: Authors Have No Obligation to Make Their Fiction Morally Perfect,"I’ve seen criticism directed at J.K. Rowling for her portrayal of house elves in Harry Potter, particularly the fact that they remain slaves and don’t get a happy ending. I think it’s completely valid for an author to create a grim, imperfect world without feeling obligated to resolve every injustice.

Fiction is a form of creative expression, and authors don’t owe readers a morally sanitized or uplifting narrative. A story doesn’t have to reflect an idealized world to have value it can challenge us by showing imperfections, hardships, or unresolved issues. The house elves in Harry Potter are a reflection of the flawed nature of the wizarding world, which itself mirrors the inequalities and blind spots of our own society.

Expecting authors to “fix” everything in their stories risks turning fiction into a checklist of moral obligations rather than a creative exploration of themes. Sometimes the lack of resolution or the depiction of an unjust system is what makes a story compelling and thought-provoking.

Ultimately, authors should have the freedom to paint their worlds as grim or dark as they want without being held to a standard of moral responsibility.

1go56j6,CMV: “educate yourself” is the intellectual version of “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” and is elitist,"In my opinion, your worldview is not something you “build yourself with your own two hands” it’s largely given to you.  This is why there are liberal areas where liberal families live and raise liberal kids, same with conservatives.  

I can’t stand people with their self righteous “educate yourself” BS.  These people act like they get up at the 4 am every day to read everything under the sun to make sure they choose the correct moral stance on a given issue, and anyone who hasn’t looked into it or come to the right conclusion is less than.  It’s honestly pathetic and it’s pure mental bias.  

A lot of you might be surprised to see how you would have voted, for instance, if you had come from deep conservative territory.  

It’s especially frustrating because half of the “high moral ground” that many of my leftist contemporaries claim is that they are EMPATHETIC TOWARDS PEOPLE.  My leftist contemporaries have sympathy for the issues that come with poverty in cities but if you’re broke and from the country and you didn’t vote blue, you’re a piece of shit.  It’s ridiculous.  

If someone comes from an area with deep ideology and is able to reject that culture and worldview and build their own, because they disagree with it, that’s amazing and those people should be commended, but people who can’t do that (vast majority of people) should not be demonized.  

If you are proud of your worldview and you think it makes you a better person, believe me you are lucky to have it and it’s a gift.  You didn’t work for it and no one owes you applause, and you’re dead wrong to make villains of people less fortunate.

1gst4rz,"CMV: Egypt will collapse, and it will trigger the largest refugee crisis in human history","I believe that Egypt is heading for a catastrophic collapse that will lead to the largest refugee wave we've ever seen. This isn't speculation—it's rooted in harsh realities of demography, food security, and economic pressures.

First, let's talk numbers: Egypt's population has exploded over recent decades, reaching over 110 million people. Projections show that this growth is not slowing down. The population continues to rise, while the country is running out of land to sustain it. Egypt already imports more than half of its food, and they are the world's largest wheat importer. Rising food prices, global supply chain issues, and instability in global markets leave Egypt extremely vulnerable to supply shocks.

Water scarcity is another massive factor. The Nile River, which Egypt relies on for 97% of its water, is under increasing stress from climate change and upstream development, particularly Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam. Egypt has a limited capacity to adapt, and water shortages will only exacerbate food insecurity.

Politically and economically, Egypt faces significant instability. The regime under President el-Sisi has been maintaining order through a combination of subsidies and repression, but this is unsustainable. Rising economic pressure on the poorest citizens, compounded by inflation, energy crises, and unemployment, will create widespread unrest.

When (not if) Egypt's stability breaks, it will trigger a massive outflow of refugees, mainly toward Europe and neighboring countries. We are talking about millions of people moving due to famine, water scarcity, and political collapse. If we look at the Syrian Civil War and the refugee crisis that followed, it pales in comparison to what could happen here.

This isn't just a humanitarian crisis in waiting; it's a geopolitical time bomb that will reshape borders, cause international tensions, and strain global systems.

1gingrk,"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child.","Academically, even with access to curriculum supports, almost all parents are going to struggle to provide a comprehensive education in all subjects to the level a public school would. Even if the parent has a strong academic background, they will be missing elements of other subjects or of pedagogy in general. They may struggle to fully identify progress or gaps in learning that go on to multiply in the subsequent years.  
  
Beyond academics, a key function of school is the social aspect - to expose young children to their peers and social scenarios both positive and negative for them to navigate in preparation for adulthood. You can try to supplement this with playgroups, team sports, etc. to some extent, but you're not going to replicate the nature or frequency of school relationships.

Finally, the fact that the majority of their peers will have these common experiences will leave them perpetually feeling like an outsider, even once school is well behind them.

All of the above leads to believe homeschooled students are being done a disadvantage by parents who insist on it, usually for self-serving, insular reasons, or to ensure they are not taught aspects of the curriculum they disagree with.

1gly6bc,CMV: Terms Like 'Incel' Prove That We Reduce People's Worth to Sexual Success,"Let’s start with the term “incel,” which often reduces a person’s value to whether they succeed in the dating world. I think this is a narrow view. After all, it overlooks bigger struggles, like isolation and the lack of meaningful relationships, which are real issues. When we focus only on sexual success, we miss the chance to understand deeper emotional needs and human dignity.

Indeed, not all men who identify as “incels” (or are labeled as such) see others as mere objects for sex. However, the culture around the term often promotes (and proves) a transactional view of relationships, where human connections are reduced to something that validates someone’s identity. In my opinion, this directly takes away from the true depth and respect that relationships should have.

Of course, misogyny, toxic masculinity, and objectifying women are serious problems, no doubt. But I think the bigger issue is that society struggles to understand human dignity. We need to see each other as whole, multi-dimensional people, not as objects to conquer or manipulate. Respect should come from this deeper recognition.

Yeah, relationships are naturally complicated, and we all want intimacy and connection. But they shouldn’t be seen as transactions, where someone’s worth is based only on what they can give in return.

In the end, I believe that sexual success should never define a person’s worth or the health of a relationship. So, when society overemphasises it, we set up unrealistic expectations, frustration, and lose sight of the emotional bonds that make relationships last.

Consequently, societal expectations impact relationships, but we need spaces where people can connect authentically, without pressure to meet shallow standards. The goal isn’t to eliminate all expectations but to shift the focus away from appearances or sexual success and make room for genuine, meaningful connections.",borisdandorra,673,732,0.6399999856948853,0.3303640121187038,1731006127,/r/changemyview/comments/1gly6bc/cmv_terms_like_incel_prove_that_we_reduce_peoples/,2024,11,changemyview,2024-11-07 19:02:07

This comes up the most with Spanish since the US has a very large Latino/Hispanic population, but it applies to all languages. It’s honestly just a respect thing, if you’re going to come to someone else’s country then you should know the language or try your best to learn enough to make your way around. And I know people are going to say “America doesn’t have an official language” but most of the states do, do most people here would consider that our main language. 

I also think a lot of people protest this because they think American English speakers = white people and learning English is something white people want minorities who come here to do. But that’s not even the case, the majority of people who were born here only speak English. Not to mention black people who have been here 400 years speak English and this is our country as well. To me it’s about basic respect. You wouldn’t move to France and not learn French. You wouldn’t move to Mexico and not learn Spanish. You wouldn’t move to China and not learn mandarin. And if you would and you make no effort to learn the language you’re probably a douche ",Accomplished-Fix1204,506,904,0.699999988079071,0.3245365727697039,1731421857,/r/changemyview/comments/1gpm00t/cmv_people_should_learn_english_if_theyre_going/,2024,11,changemyview,2024-11-12 14:30:57
1gww5gv,CMV: American “patriots” who sympathize with Putin are not actually patriots,"I don’t think it’s reasonable to say you’re a patriot and that you support western values and then turn around and sympathize/ show support for authoritarian dictator Vladimir Putin. You either are a patriot that supports western values, or you are *not* a patriot and support fascism. Being a patriot means you’re proud of your country and your countries values. In the United States, our values mainly consist of equality, diversity, freedom, democracy, and equal opportunity, just to name a few. 

If you call yourself an american patriot, it means that you are proud of these values that your country holds. If you’re proud of equality, why are you supporting a foreign dictator who doesn’t believe in equality? Members of the LGBTQ community are terribly persecuted in Russia, and the majority of russians support laws discriminating against the gay community. Freedom? If you claim to be an american patriot, you should clearly support freedom. There is alot of censorship in russia and freedom of speech is pretty much non existent there. Putin has his political opponents  jailed, executed or exiled. No fair elections. Doesn’t sound like freedom to me… 

Democracy? I’ve pretty much just explained how there is no democracy in Russia. No fair elections, having political opponents killed or jailed, limited or no free speech, no freedom of expression. If you sympathize with Putin, you don’t believe in any of those things. So you don’t actually care about American values.

Equal opportunity? Simply doesn’t exist in Russia. 

There are so many Americans sympathizing with or even idolizing Putin, and they claim to be American patriots. Most of these people are among the MAGA crowd of course, but not all of them.

1h0fnml,CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same,"For those that do not know either of those, let me explain.

4B is a movement that was started by feminists in South Korea in response to a highly misogynistic society - no sex with men, no giving birth, no dating men, and no marrying men [called 4B because all those in Korean start with ""B""]. 

MGTOW, Men Going Their Own Way, is a similar movement started by anti-feminists where ""men go their own way"" - leave women alone and focus on self-improvement. It is considered bad, at least in part because people like Andrew Tate and the right-wing have coopted it.

Both of these movements have misandrists [for 4B]/misogynists [for MGTOW], yet 4B gets praised while MGTOW is considered a hate movement and synonymous with incels. Some women even seek to start a 4B movement in the US in light of the recent election.

I am purely calling out the double-standard here. It is okay for women to have their independence movement, yet men are considered evil creeps for trying to do the same.

1gr1tbe,CMV: It isn't hyperbolic for the west to be worried about the rise of fascism,"Like clockwork, economic downturn inevitably leads to populists using minorities and migrants as cultural scapegoats to solve economic problems - and in turn disillusioned citizens become increasingly disgruntled with existing political structures. It's a fertile space for authoritarian leaders to promise swift and easy solutions to complex questions.

The Great Depression and the post-WW1 economy spurred the rise of the Nazis, Mussolini's Fascist Party and Franco’s Dictatorship.

Here in the UK movements like the BUF, National Front and now arguably UKIP/Reform have bubbled up during The Great Depression, Stagflation and the various modern financial crises respectively.

Even eastwards, while not strictly a fascist state, the dissolution of the Soviet Union opened the door in Russia for far-right, nationalist and authoritarian movements that still maintain power to this day.

It's not hard to draw comparisons between these examples and our contemporary lay of the land. We know the economy isn't ideal for most people right now. We know it's the highest concern for most of a given electorate. We know that minorities and immigrants are being touted as the solution to many of those concerns. We know that sadly, a great deal of those solutions are veering into dehumanization and will only continue to do so while populists continue to win support.

I don't believe we're standing right at the doors of fascism at this very moment and I basically believe many of our institutions can withstand authoritarian power grabs for the time being. But it's my view that a worst-case scenario of a western fascist state - or a fascist movement with a lot of support - is an increasingly possible reality that its pretty reasonable to actively worry and talk about.",hotdog_jones,609,721,0.699999988079071,0.3115682596784264,1731579850,/r/changemyview/comments/1gr1tbe/cmv_it_isnt_hyperbolic_for_the_west_to_be_worried/,2024,11,changemyview,2024-11-14 10:24:10
1gvof1v,CMV: Pedo hunters/ Vigilantes are NOT doing the right thing ,"
You know, the videos on social media going viral of “pedo hunters” luring men in and then proceeding to humiliate them in public/ beat them and 9/10, they don’t even call the police. So what’s the point of even luring them out if you’re not even going to call the police and report them? Any reason you can think of just leads to these pedo hunters getting some sort of gain/satisfaction from it, and not that they actually care about stopping pedos. If they actually cared about stopping it, they’d have the person arrested instead of just humiliating them and then letting them go to potentially do the same again. 

1: They go viral 
2: They have an excuse to physically assault someone without legal consequences, because they know these guys they’re assaulting won’t call the police because of what they’re being accused of could also get them arrested 
3: They get to look like “hero’s” for beating up a dude who is accused of trying to meet up with children. 

Let me make myself clear, i have absolutely no sympathy for pedophiles. I wish they’d all just drop off the face of the earth. However, this affects much more than just the men caught in these stings. It affects their wives if they have one, their children, their siblings, their family. Anyone closely associated with this person who goes viral will be humiliated aswell. 

Not to mention, some men in this situation actually didn’t know the person was underage until they were already at the meet up location:

Some have died 

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/world/europe/netherlands-pedophile-hunters.html

Either call the police immediately after luring these men out, or sit back and let the police catch them themselves. This whole “look at me i’m a hero because i just beat up a guy and shaved his head and made him eat dog food because he tried to meet a 15 year old boy” isn’t justice, it’s just unnecessary violence. Besides, it isn’t their place to deliver justice, it’s a judges place.

1gzmh2l,CMV: Lying and exaggerating trumps rhetoric (or any rhetoric for that matter) only leads to more defenders of said rhetoric. ,"What I noticed a lot during this campaign was that people would say “look at what this person said” and you look at their comments and the actual tweet or Reddit post or news article you see is an interpretation of seemingly unrelated comments. I don’t know if I’m allowed to identify a subreddit here but there’s one particular page that is notorious for this. There was a whole thing about how Trump threatened Kamala supporters but he actually said something like “raise your hand actually don’t do that because it would be bad” at one of his rally’s which in reality is not a threat. It’s unprofessional and should not be coming from a presidential candidate but they made it seem worse than it was. The same rhetoric exists around abortion. Labeling anybody anti abortion as someone who wants to control women’s bodies when their reality could be that they genuinely believe it’s murder. I think when you say these things to make someone seem more extreme than they actually are then it makes people see the actual harm they bring to society in a less harmful way. They look like they’re being attacked. I always say, if you believe in something the truth should be enough to convince people Trump said plenty of terrible things and a lot of it is posted on his website. Weaponize his real words against him.

1gh8oh6,CMV: There is nothing inherently wrong with losing weight via Ozempic & similar drugs,"(this argument assumes there is no scarcity for the drug, and that me using it would not prevent others from having access to it or raise prices)

If the health issues due to obesity are greater than the side effects of ozempic then the patient should take ozempic. There has been a tremendous amount of hate for this drug from both extremes of the ""fatphobia"" spectrum. On one side you have the extreme anti-fatphobia crowd that thinks ozempic is bad because there is nothing wrong with being fat, and on the other end you have those who genuinely hate fat people thinking ozempic is wrong because you should have to lose weight the old fashioned way.

Most people sit somewhere in the middle on that spectrum. So do I. Drugs are neither good or bad. All that matters is their effects, and ozempic has shown astonishing clinical results in weight loss. Think most people would agree obesity is a big public health issue in our society (or maybe that's a CMV for another day). I don't think it's morally wrong to be fat, but I don't think it's good for you.

Personally I want to stop being fat for both health and aesthetic reasons, and I don't think that should be moralized. While it is not a huge priority in my life right now, I'd love to go on ozempic if it could help me lose weight. If I lost some weight it would be so much easier to be active and live a genuinely healthy lifestyle. And I would feel better about myself. I don't see what the big deal with ""doing it right"" is. I acknowledge that there are some side effects but those side effects pale in comparison to the hit to my quality of life caused by obesity. I have tried many many times to lose weight ""the right way"" to no avail. I have since learned to feel okay in my body, but tbh I would be a lot more comfortable if I were 100lb lighter. (26yo 6'4"" 350lb male for anyone who needs to know). As I get older my weight is going to affect my life span. If going on ozempic could add years and quality to my life why shouldn't I use it?

I know a lot of people will say ""it could have side effects we don't know about yet,"" but I don't find that convincing. *Everything* could have side-effects we don't know about yet. Being obese has side effects I *do* know about and experience right now. I view this argument the same as I view anti-vax arguments: the FDA's drug screening process is a lot more reliable than my unscientific intuition.

Edit:

On the argument ""when you stop taking it you'll gain the weight back""

I would be willing take it forever. And even if I couldn't, I just want to be healthy and active while I am young at least for a little while. My chance to do that is slipping away.

I haven't been a healthy weight since before puberty. I have never been athletic. I want to try sports and actually be good at them. I want to be able to run without shame and pain. I want to feel good when I look in the mirror. Even if it's temporary I want just a little time like that.

This argument alone cannot be dispositive. Being healthy for a little while and then going back to being fat is better than having been fat the whole time.

Edit 2:

I find it hilarious that I have explained multiple times how I managed to lose weight and keep it off when I lived in a different country with conditions that made it easier to make healthy choices and instead of trying to help me find solutions based on what has already worked, many brilliant health experts in the comments are suggesting ""no, ignore that. Keep everything in your life exactly the same but just start doing diet and exercise. You lack the willpower? Well stop it you silly goose. It's actually easy if you aren't such a pathetic loser.""

1gk7ekw,CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism,"I feel like a lot of left-wingers are stuck in the mindset, that Non-Western cultures are inherently less oppressive and more free than Western cultures, even though they are much more conservative than Western ones. American right-wing Christians have much more in common with Conservative Muslims than they think, compared to Atheist Progressive people. It is just they use the same tactics in controlling societies, but they happened to be in different teams.

It is just happened, that Non-Western traditionalists don’t have political power to have influence in Western politics and install their supremacy, so they fall into the category of oppressed ones, however the left-wingers fail to realize, that they are not their ideological allies. In fact they will oppose Western equality until they will have the right to install their rules. 

I have no idea, how Western societies can tolerate their traditionalism as the culture, if it is inherently oppressive. For the same rules we can perceive culture of some hardcore weird Christian sects of Deep South, like Quiverfull, their own culture, but we are aware, that this Deep Southerner Christian culture is really bad for USA as a whole and it would be better, if it was disbanded. I am aware, sone of y’all will say, that they don’t have a culture etc, however mostly it is political instrument to fight against these cultures rather than a correct statement (I also hate Christianity too).

Especially, i see this problem with Non-Western men rather than with Non-Western women. Non-Western women actually care about relationships between different groups and collective callout of bigotry, while retaining their culture in more ecological ways, while Non-Western men tend to be hypocrites in using only anti-racist rhetoric against White racists (who they actually share most of core beliefs with, but they are in different teams), while actively participating in sexism and homophobia, defending their actions with “muh these are our traditions” shield.

I believe the core of the Republican Party’s influence is to look at people who are hurting and then give them a person to blame. I believe that a lot of women unfortunately have them evidence as to why young men can blame women on why they’re hurting.

 So you see someone joking to “kill all men” which you feel targeted and excluded by, but they way your feelings are met is “it’s just a joke, tons of men say worse” doesn’t really paint a good picture of feminists. Even if the persons making the jokes aren’t feminists. 

Slogans like “yes, all men” fall victim even harder because that’s one that is used a lot more for feminists. You run into the same issue, young men do not want to be grouped in with the worst men, sure “not all men” is a distractor, but saying yes all men pushes culpability for horrific actions for actually horrible men.

1h3po9u,CMV: Illegals immigrants are not “doing jobs Americans don’t want to do” ,"
I don’t like this argument that’s us democrats tend to use when defending their stance on immigration. I don’t believe that Americans “don’t want to do those jobs”, I believe that Americans *dont* do them, because the illegal immigrations stronghold has caused wages for those jobs to be undermining to most Americans, who can find another job that pays more. 

We know that lots of farmers are illegals immigrants in southern states, most likely paid cash, or right at minimum wage. They are not going to argue about higher wages like Americans would, so until that stronghold by illegal immigrants is fairer, whether that’s through citizenship or deportation, Americans simply won’t do this jobs.


Some stats: In the 474 separate occupations defined by the Department of Commerce, illegal immigrants are the majority workforce in *zero* (https://cis.org/Report/There-Are-No-Jobs-Americans-Wont-Do)

* Maids and housekeepers: 51 percent native-born

* Construction laborers: 65 percent native-born

I believe that argument is that Americans do not want to fill the jobs of illegals immigrants who are underpaid. Many contractors in the south hire cheap, illegal labor. Of course the average American does not want to fill those positions, unless wages are brought to standard. 

Either way, I think it will have major impacts on the economy, if a lot of these workers are deported, which I do not believe they will be, bearing criminal records.

1gvw1rk,CMV: Modern Politics is no longer Left/Right but Up/Down on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,"Modern politics is no longer represented by Left/Right, but instead by Up/Down on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Those needs are portrayed in the shape of a pyramid, as an individual's most basic needs must be satisfied before working towards higher-level needs. The levels are the following, starting from the bottom:

1. Physiological needs
2. Safety needs
3. Belongingness & Love needs
4. Esteem needs
5. Self-actualisation

Currently, based on the issues that Left/Right-wing parties identify with, it's possible to observe a shift from traditional economic/ideological divides towards a division based on different levels of Maslow's hierarchy.

Right-wing parties generally prioritise issues related to the lower levels of the hierarchy, such as Physiological needs (economic stability, food prices, gas prices) and Safety needs (crime, immigration control, self-defence). 

Left-wing parties, on the other hand, prioritise issues related to the higher levels of the hierarchy, such as Belongingness needs (diversity, equality, inclusion), Esteem needs (social justice, representation in media) and Self-actualisation (activism, environmental sustainability).

This is also the reason why a lot of people on either side are unable to comprehend the issues that matter to the other side. If you have to satisfy your Basic needs (Physiological & Safety), you will find Psychological needs (Belongingness, Esteem) to be irrelevant to your current situation, as they're luxuries you can't afford.

1h1sxtn,CMV: Adultery Should Be Treated as Breach of Contract with Financial Penalties,"Marriage isn’t just about love; it’s also a legal agreement regulated by the government. When you get married, you get a government-issued marriage license, which essentially makes it a formal contract between two people. So, if someone cheats (without consent), isn’t that a clear breach of the agreement? And if contracts in business or other legal contexts come with penalties when broken, why not this one too?

Here’s my view: adultery should be treated as fraud or deceit, not just a personal issue. If one partner cheats, there should be tangible, government-enforced consequences - like fines or losing alimony rights. This wouldn’t make cheating a criminal offense, but it would acknowledge the harm caused and hold the cheater accountable. Right now, the cheated-on spouse often suffers emotionally *and* financially (if they choose to start divorce proceedings), while the cheater faces no real repercussions. That’s just unfair.

1gv7sd3,"CMV: White, Evangelical American Christians have the biggest persecution complexes in this country. ","I believe in America, the people with the biggest persecution complexes are white evangelical Christians. They consistently talk about how they are oppressed because other people are slowly receiving equal treatment under the law. (More rights for others doesn’t equal less rights for you, it’s not pie). They say that they are underrepresented whilst making up the majority of elected positions (55% according to PRC). They say that lgbtq+ people or anyone statistically disadvantaged by the government is “forcing” their lifestyle on others while actively trying to pass religious based laws, resending laws that have been on the books for 50 years based on religious reasons, and trying to force the Bible and prayer into public school curriculum. Every system in the United States is set up in favor of them and yet they cry oppression at any semblance of religious freedom or their privileges being lessened. 

Ways you can change my view:

1. Prove they aren’t (or aren’t trying to) rigorously enforcing their views into most people’s daily lives. 

2. Prove that they are actually facing legitimate forms of oppression

3. Prove that other groups of Americans (POC, Atheists, LGBTQ+, etc.) have higher (unjustified) persecution complexes.

1gty4bv,"CMV: Americans and people in the West's criticism of Netanyahu is for the ""wrong reasons"", and would have been the same if any other Israeli was in charge","Israelis hate Netanyahu, but not because of the reasons Americans/people in the world despise him. Israelis hate Netanyahu because he is a corrupted megalomaniac with a god complex, not because of ""war crimes"" or because of his tough stances on Palestinians. In fact most Israelis dislike the Palestinians (especially after Oct7) and share the tough stances on them. 

Even when Netanyahu goes, Israelis still won't support a 2SS (Most of the opposition opposes it), the War will continue and in fact, all of the criticism about Netanyahu for his management of the War and the genocide remarks would have been the same even if Lapid or Yair Golan were in charge, because when it comes to the War and Oct7, most of Israelis are pretty united. (While they are divided when it comes to the Hostage deal, the global Ceasefire now crowd is using the hostages to push a prominent ceasefire that will keep Hamas in power and end the War, while Israelis who want the hostage deal still want Hamas destroyed and to continue the war after the deal)

The Western left who considers themselves as Pro-Israel and anti-bibi, wants Netanyahu gone because they see him as an ""obstacle"" to the 2 State solution (That nowadays no Israeli and no Palestinian support). They don't really care about his domestic corruption and attempts to become a de-facto dictator. At the same time, if you would say to the Israeli public (including the secular centrists who voted for people like Lapid, Gantz and Lieberman) that the world views Bibi as an obstacle to the 2SS, it would make them appreciate Netanyahu for standing up to the world and deflecting pressures.

1gl5345,"CMV: Most reddit mods are biased and remove/leave content which they personally disagree/agree with, despite it violating/not violating the rules of the subreddit.","Alright, let’s talk about something I’ve noticed happening on Reddit.   
  
Moderators there are supposed to be impartial, right? They’re tasked with enforcing rules fairly, keeping things balanced, and making sure discussions stay open for everyone. But lately, it seems like some moderators are letting personal beliefs influence what stays and what goes.   
  
They’re picking which posts stay visible based on whether they agree with them or not, which can feel unfair to a lot of users. Sometimes, posts that are technically against the rules are allowed to stay up if they fit a certain narrative. And other times, posts that don’t break any guidelines get removed because they don’t align with a particular perspective. This inconsistency in enforcement can lead to a sense of unfairness for a lot of users who feel like the playing field isn’t even.   
  
What I am seeing as a result is that Reddit is turning into more of an echo chamber in certain spaces. Many subreddits tend to show only one side of a conversation, one perspective. If you’ve got an opposing opinion, or you want to question the main views in those subs, it’s tough to have your voice heard.  


Take r/pics for example, we know that it got so much bad rep for political posts throughout the 2024 US Presidential Election cycle, I mean all of you who are active on that subreddit saw how we had 10s of posts everyday where embarrassing pictures regarding the two candidates were shared.   


But I saw that the posts which were against Donald Trump (Republicans) got 1000s of upvotes and comments. While the ones against the Democrats, got removed by mods there fairly quickly. Even though the posts did not break any rule.  
  
I believe this kind of moderation is harmful to free speech and people deserve a chance to share their perspectives in an open forum and feel confident that the rules are applied the same way to everyone.   
  
That said, I’m open to changing my mind on this. If there’s a valid reason why this approach to moderation is necessary or if someone can make a solid case for how it’s ultimately better for the community, I’m all ears. I’m not set in stone here—if there’s a perspective I haven’t considered, I’d genuinely like to hear it.",Embarrassed-Try4601,545,311,0.8500000238418579,0.2068551945766501,1730917055,/r/changemyview/comments/1gl5345/cmv_most_reddit_mods_are_biased_and_removeleave/,2024,11,changemyview,2024-11-06 18:17:35

This is evident by Trump's nomination of utterly and completely unqualified people to head them up.  Red states may have voted for this but blue states didn't, and their residents don't want no oversight of the environment/pollution, worker safety, disease control/human health, education, and so on.  While every blue state could in theory set up its own equivalent of the EPA, OSHA, FDA, etc., that would be quite cumbersome.  They could set up their own apparatuses that would have jurisdiction in all subscribing blue states (interstate judicial compact).  This would effectively safeguard the interests of the citizens of blue states.  As an added bonus, enormous pressure would be put upon red states, whose businesses would effectively be shut out from operating in blue states without compliance, and blue states have the majority of the GDP and economic power.

1gyvez1,cmv: Abortion bans like the one in Idaho don't actually protect the life of the mother because they were intentionally drafted to allow for excessive danger to women.  ,"Many of the abortion bans are dangerous for women.  Conservatives say these bills aren't dangerous because they provide exceptions for life of the mother.  I actually bought this line to some extent until these news stories started popping up, and even then I was a bit skeptical, but I decided to research these bans myself, and that's when I saw exactly how dangerous they are.

The one in Idaho provides that an abortion may be performed when ""necessary to save the life of the mother"" with no clarification given as far as I can tell. That is both incredibly restrictive language, and incredibly vague. So let's say a woman has a 45% chance of dying if the doctors don't perform an abortion, is doing one ""necessary"" to save her life? What about 10%? With a 2-5 year prison sentence awaiting any doctor who violates these rules, and with them being so strict and vague, it's no wonder than women are being put in dangerous positions.  

""Necessary"" in other statutes and case law is often deemed to include a time requirement. So even if a condition will likely lead to the mother's death, a doctor may have to wait until the situation gets bad enough to actually treat her which further adds to the danger. 

As incompetent as state legislators can be, half of them are lawyers and know exactly what they were doing with language like this.  They are making it as difficult as possible to get an abortion while still telling the public they are protecting the lives of women, even when they are not.

Even if one is pro life, most of them still support protections for the life of the mother. They should want these bans to be repealed and to be replaced with something more reasonable that actually protect the life of the mother

1gprni8,cmv: The “girl-bossification” of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is.,"It has become apparent in recent times that sex-work, either through OF or other means, has been received as a feminist movement that empowers women for sexualising themselves in exchange for money.

I’ll preface this by saying that I don’t wish to demonise sex work; women pushed to those positions should be protected and unharmed, and don’t deserve hateful narratives expressed in media.

However, on the other hand, not demonising prostitution or sex work does not mean viewing it as some profound, empowering stance. Sure, in an ideal world, to engage in sex work without the inequality of demand, pay, and income, would possibly result in a less degrading position, but that simply isn’t the world we live in. 

I’ve seen points such as: 

1) “Well, I could be assaulted/consent for sex, without making any money. So why not introduce an economic aspect to it?”

That is a reductive approach to the concept of one’s bodily autonomy. It is absolutely a tragedy that one could be assaulted, and feel as though they could gain something from it—and yes, hypersexuality is often a symptom of those who’ve experienced sexual abuse. These are not (a) empowering decisions, or (b) healthy decisions. In the same way that people may have found unhealthy coping mechanisms for PTSD, trying to own oneself sexually through economic means is similar in that regard. Consent cannot be garnered correctly wherein a transactional relationship is established. 

Similarly, if one does consent to sex, but also considers the monetary gain that could come from it, they may need to consider why they connect sex with an act of labour—is it because you are sleeping with partners you don’t like/are attracted to, or is it seen as an economic benefit that one could obtain? Are you considering sex work because you want to provide for yourself with means that are more easily accessible, as opposed to being rejected/unhappy in the normal corporate world? Perhaps the issue is that we are fed with media that convinces us that luxury is comfortability, and we woe the mundane life. Or perhaps we view sex work as easy and a get-rich quick scheme; consumers of it being stupid and desperate enough to pay for anything. But that isn’t the case.

As I’ve mentioned before, consent via economic transaction is not usual consent. That is not to say it’s abuse, or rape, but it is not normal relationship consent. It is not a hookup, or FWB, or relationship-established occurrence. It is the subjugation of one individual to service another. And regardless of the subjugated party gains money or economic gain from it, it is still an entirely degrading act to force oneself into. 

Feminists online seem to embrace sex work as a profoundly anti-patriarchal stance, without the realisation that it isn’t as autonomous as it seems. I will reiterate that sex workers deserve respect, but we shouldn’t parade it as a viable solution to earning money, or as a job. It is deeply flawed and dangerous, and in a modern society, we shouldn’t embrace the selling of one’s body.",Careful-Panda9885,377,493,0.800000011920929,0.202924397823161,1731436132,/r/changemyview/comments/1gprni8/cmv_the_girlbossification_of_sex_work_is_not_the/,2024,11,changemyview,2024-11-12 18:28:52
1gr8gng,CMV: Reddit is a Left Wing Echo Chamber,"I believe Reddit has become a left-wing echo chamber that stifles diverse political discourse, especially evident in the wake of Donald Trump's recent re-election. My view is based on the following observations:

1. Downvoting of conservative views: On many popular subreddits, conservative opinions are often heavily downvoted, effectively hiding them from view. This discourages conservatives from participating.
2. Moderation bias: Some major subreddits have moderation teams that seem to disproportionately remove conservative content or ban conservative users for minor rule violations.
3. Lack of conservative spaces: While there are some conservative subreddits, they are relatively small and isolated compared to the liberal-leaning default and popular subs.
4. One-sided political content: Political news and discussions on r/politics and other major subs tend to have a clear liberal slant, with conservative viewpoints rarely gaining traction.
5. Reinforcement of liberal views: The upvote system tends to amplify already popular liberal opinions, creating a feedback loop.
6. Absence of positive coverage for Trump's re-election: Despite Donald Trump winning the 2024 election, there's a noticeable lack of positive or even neutral coverage on major subreddits. Most posts about his victory are overwhelmingly negative or dismissive, ignoring the fact that a significant portion of the American population supported him.

This echo chamber effect is particularly concerning as it fails to reflect the reality of the political landscape.

1goeneu,"CMV: Americans don’t realize how fortunate they are compared to most of the world.

","Hello guys! 



So, I’m a European, and I wanted to share an outsider's perspective on what I think of American life. I often hear Americans talk about their struggles, the “rat race” culture, healthcare costs, or the pressure to succeed. I get it—no place is perfect. But I sometimes wonder if people in the U.S. realize how much they actually have going for them, especially compared to most of the world.



From where I sit, the U.S. has so many advantages that are easy to take for granted. For instance:



\*\*Higher Salaries and Access to Resources:\*\* When I see what many Americans make, even in entry-level jobs, it’s much higher than in a lot of European countries. It’s not unusual to find people earning really solid money in certain U.S. industries where those jobs just don’t pay as well here. And while the cost of living varies, the potential for income growth in the U.S. is immense.



\*\*Economic Dominance and Influence:\*\* The U.S. has an economy that’s massive on a global scale. American companies, innovations, and cultural exports dominate worldwide. That opens doors for people who might have an idea, product, or dream that could make it big. It’s a different playing field compared to what we have, where things are more stable but often slower and harder to scale.



\*\*Endless Opportunities:\*\* The “American Dream” may be a cliché, but I think there’s some truth in it. The diversity of landscapes, industries, and educational opportunities is unmatched. People from all around the world move to the U.S. specifically to chase opportunities. From Silicon Valley to Hollywood to Wall Street, there are specialized career paths that just don’t exist in other countries.



\*\*Power in Numbers and Influence:\*\* As a European, I see the influence of American culture, politics, and media constantly, even here. The U.S. has a massive cultural and political footprint, which can be frustrating at times, but there’s also power in it. Americans get to help set global trends and policies, and that gives people in the U.S. a voice and level of influence that few other countries have.



\*\*Innovation and Infrastructure:\*\* There’s a strong innovation culture in the U.S., with people who are ready to embrace change. Technology, entertainment, and business innovations often start there before going global. America has some impressive infrastructure, too, even if it doesn’t always seem that way to people living there. For example, you have massive universities with resources on a scale you rarely see anywhere else.



\*\*Social and Cultural Diversity:\*\* The U.S. is so vast and diverse, culturally and socially. I feel like people in the U.S. have endless opportunities to explore different lifestyles, perspectives, and hobbies that bring vibrancy to everyday life. You can meet people from almost every background and culture—something that is harder to find in many smaller, more homogenous countries.



\*\*Higher Education System and Research Opportunities:\*\* While the cost of college in the U.S. is famously high, the country still has some of the best universities and research facilities in the world. Graduating from an American university can open doors globally, and there's a level of innovation and funding in research that’s tough to match elsewhere. Many cutting-edge fields and technologies are pioneered there, making it a fantastic environment for academics and researchers.



\*\*Access to Vast Natural Beauty and Outdoor Activities:\*\* The diversity of landscapes in the U.S. is incredible. There’s everything from national parks and ski resorts to beaches and desert landscapes. Americans have access to some of the most spectacular natural beauty in the world, with the infrastructure and freedom to explore it relatively easily—often just a road trip away. That’s something many countries don’t offer in the same abundance or scale.



\*\*Job Mobility and Flexibility:\*\* In the U.S., it’s relatively common for people to switch jobs or move to different states in search of better opportunities. In many European countries, job markets are more stable but can also be restrictive. In America, people have a high degree of freedom to pursue different paths, start new careers, or move around, which can be both liberating and rewarding.



\*\*Advancements in Medicine and Cutting-Edge Healthcare:\*\* Despite the challenges with affordability, the U.S. is often at the forefront of medical advancements, from high-end surgeries to pioneering treatments for rare conditions. American hospitals and research institutions lead in many fields, and the country offers access to some of the world’s most advanced healthcare technology.



\*\*Consumer Variety and Convenience:\*\* Americans have access to an incredible range of products, often at lower prices compared to much of the world. The convenience culture, where many services are available 24/7, is also unique. Fast food, extensive shopping options, and rapid delivery services add convenience that isn’t as common or accessible elsewhere.



\*\*Support for Innovation and Startups:\*\* The “startup culture” is so deeply rooted in the U.S., and there’s infrastructure to back it up—incubators, venture capital funding, and an investor mindset that encourages people to try new things. People with entrepreneurial ambitions have a lot of resources, networks, and access to capital to help bring their ideas to life, something that’s often harder to come by in more traditional economies.



\*\*Strong Legal System and Individual Rights:\*\* Americans enjoy a high degree of personal freedom and strong protections for individual rights under the Constitution. Freedom of speech, the right to privacy, and legal protections for workers are more robust in the U.S. than in many countries. This legal infrastructure can create a sense of security and autonomy that’s valued by many.



\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Even with its issues, the U.S. has a lot going for it—economic opportunity, natural beauty, innovation, and freedoms that many people around the world dream of. As a European, I wonder if Americans appreciate just how fortunate they are to live in a place that offers so much.",RotenSquids,512,304,0.7799999713897705,0.196877647429197,1731282737,/r/changemyview/comments/1goeneu/cmv_americans_dont_realize_how_fortunate_they_are/,2024,11,changemyview,2024-11-10 23:52:17

1gnxluh,"CMV: We are producing Lost Boys in factory-like quantities, and the price will be astronomical","The hustle economy isn’t building anything sustainable; it’s hollowing out young men from the inside, encouraging them to project a flimsy brand rather than develop genuine value. And while everyone’s waving the flag of empowerment or self-actualization, all they're actually doing is exploiting a generation starving for direction, identity, and validation—otherwise known as the Lost Boys. 

>The Lost Boys Phenomenon: Disposable Youth

For the past two decades, we’ve been cultivating an entire demographic of disillusioned young men—educated in classrooms that devalue them, raised in families that are increasingly unstable or absent, and sent into a society that neither needs nor respects them. Despite the hand-wringing articles, neither side of the ideological divide cares about solving this problem; both are too busy pushing their own shallow narratives. On one hand, society shames these men as “overgrown boys” who avoid responsibility; on the other, it calls them “toxic” or dangerous if they express traditional masculinity. It’s a catch-22: no role models, no roadmap, just isolation and contradiction. Enter the Hustle Economy. It's the lifeline dangling in front of these young men. Except it’s not a lifeline; it’s a noose.

>Hustle Culture: The Mirage of Influence

In the hustle economy, brand trumps substance every time. Fame, however hollow, is currency. Validation, however fleeting, is dopamine. But here's the reality: we’ve created a system where ""influence"" is a simulacrum of achievement, where image and validation replace any real development of skills or character. Young men aren’t learning to create, innovate, or lead; they’re learning how to project a hollow image. They’re being conned into thinking that the *performance* of success is the same as success itself. Today, any Lost Boy can be a “thought leader” by spewing someone else’s platitudes into an algorithm and watching the numbers roll in.

But it’s all smoke and mirrors. The influencers and gurus selling the fantasy of the hustle economy—personal brands, online courses, or lifestyle tips—are the biggest hustlers of all. They’ve perfected the art of selling air, and they’re pulling these young men into their orbit by promising a quick path to purpose, self-worth, and financial success. What’s the result? It’s a generation of men seeking identity in follower counts and purpose in the next “grind,” never realizing they’re burning out their very souls for a temporary high that leaves them emptier each time.

> The Brand of Me: Identity in Freefall

Here’s the truth: we’ve so deeply intertwined personal identity with brand identity that young men now equate their self-worth with the size of their online following. It’s a vicious cycle. The hustle economy feeds insecurity by tying self-worth to fleeting metrics. Today, being a “man of substance” means being a man with influence, with likes, with numbers. No one cares what you do if no one can see it. And the problem with that? It’s a treadmill. When followers are your identity, you can’t afford to stop. When money is your validation, you can’t afford to fail.

This is what we're teaching them: that the projection of value is more critical than actual value, that growth is measured in clicks, not character. It's creating a generation of men who are as disposable as the metrics they chase. When numbers inevitably decline, when the brand fails to pivot, they’re left with nothing. And the cycle repeats, chewing up the next wave of Lost Boys looking for someone—anyone—to show them what it means to be worth something.

>The Hustle Economy: Grifters Teaching Grifters

These “gurus” and “coaches” know exactly what they’re doing: they’ve created an economy that preys on the desperate, selling hope in the form of clickbait aspirations. Each influencer, each “life coach,” each self-proclaimed expert is making bank by leveraging the vulnerabilities of the Lost Boys, who are seduced by the promise of easy money, fame, and—let’s be honest—female validation. The young men they’re targeting don’t know any better, because no one taught them anything better. They’re sheep without shepherds, and the only “guidance” they’re receiving is coming from people who are just looking to turn a profit on their insecurities. 

And let’s be clear: there’s no real value in what’s being sold. Hustlers aren’t innovating; they’re replicating the same playbooks, the same formulas, the same lies, and branding it as something revolutionary. They’re conning young men into buying courses, joining mastermind groups, and “leveling up” their personal brands, all while knowing that these Lost Boys are just prey. The real business of the hustle economy isn’t self-actualization or empowerment; it’s self-delusion, mass-marketed and highly profitable.

> The Cost: A Generation Hollowed Out

So where does this leave us? With a generation of men who are nothing but empty shells, men who have wasted their youth chasing shadows, men who wake up one day with nothing to show for their time except a string of expired “opportunities” and a lot of wasted money. Men who have no identity, no skills, and no real place in society. Men who are angrier, more isolated, more vulnerable than ever.

We are producing Lost Boys in factory-like quantities, and the price will be astronomical. A culture built on “influence” over innovation, on *sizzle over steak*, can only go one way: collapse.

1h1xtf9,CMV: Reddit has a moderator problem,"Just to be clear. This does not apply for all moderators. I know some moderators on small Subreddits that are really good people. Speaking for a lot of larger Subreddits where moderation is an issue. 

Reddit has a moderator problem. They can do a lot of things to you that doesn't really make lots of sense, and they do not give you a reason for it. More often than not, you're just muted from speaking with the moderator. Unfortunately, due to a lot of Reddit mods and Redditors in general being left-wing, there are a lot of examples of right-wingers being the victims. Such as this one on the r/ medicine Subreddit. He got deleted for asking questions. A person said Trump's NIH nomination caused ""large scale needless death"". When he was asked what the large scale death in question was, his comment was deleted by the mods. Along with a person being perm banned for saying ""orange man bad. Laugh at joke. Unga Bunga"" in r/ comics. The most notable case of moderation abuse is from r/ pics where they just ban you for participating in a ""bad faith Subreddit"". Even if you just commented.

This is not a good thing. It means that if you want to participate in a major Subreddit with a lot of people, you will have to conform to what the moderators personally see as ""correct"" or ""good"". This doesn't foster productive conversations, nor is it good for anybody but the moderator's egos.

1h2xlmg,CMV: 90% of Donald Trump’s public statements are hyperbolic. 50% of Americans Accept These Statements As True.,"The following are some of Trump’s most egregious hyperbolic statements:

“On Nov. 7, 2020, as news organizations correctly projected that Biden had defeated him, Trump tweeted the opposite: ‘I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!’.”

“Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third world … from prisons and jails and insane asylums and mental institutions, and she has had them resettled beautifully into your community to prey upon innocent American citizens.”

In 2024 he said the American economy is: “the worst ever.”

Donald Trump has vowed that if voters return him to the White House: “inflation will vanish completely.”

Donald Trump calls this language “truthful hyperbole.” But hyperbole is not truth.  Hyperbole departs from reality and lives in the realm of fantasy. Hyperbole is not “truthful.”  There’s no truth in hyperbole itself. 

The above-referenced statements uttered by Trump are not rooted in evidence or fact. 

Why do human beings exaggerate?  Because the human being wants to hide an untruth. The drunk driver is stopped: “How many drinks have you had tonight? The drunk driver: “two beers.”  The drunk driver has consumed 16 beers in the past five-hours. The drunk driver is exaggerating, in an effort to conceal how much alcohol he or she has consumed in the past five-hours. 

Donald Trump is the drunk driver. He wants you to believe he’s only had one or two. He’s lying.

1gslsvc,CMV: Biden should have enforced the 30 day ultimatum he gave to Israel.,"Israelpost #272623637, but since there is a 24 hr rule I wanted to post this right after FTF before someone else got to it.

So, a month ago, a ""leaked"" document showed that the US presented a series of demands to Israel focused on allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza and allowing civilians to relocate in preparation for the winter. Also, I notice an issue with people not reading the body text on this sub which makes discussion much less effective - so if you could, could anyone reading this please put the word *truck* in your response. The deadline for Israel to meet these demands passed this Tuesday, and although Israel did not fully achieve *any* of the 19 requests by the state department, the Biden administration has stated that they will not take any action to pressure Netanyahu.

My argument is that the inaction on Biden's part is both morally wrong, and strategically illogical because it adds to the perception that American ""demands"" are feckless and can be ignored. Furthermore, I would argue that Biden's failure to back up the demands *he* made based on findings by *his* administration that Israel was rendering upon Gaza conditions not fit for human survival renders him complicit in the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

1gpz6d9,CMV: Being pro-life with rape and incest exceptions makes no sense.,"#I am pro-choice.

So if you're pro-life, most of the time its going to be because you view the fetus as a human life that has the right to live, it deserves protections, rights, personhood, moral consideration, etc. And i guess by extention, you view abortion as the murder of a baby or something along those lines. Now, that is a position i completely disagree with, but i can still understand the position because i myself was pro-life up until a few years ago, however even when i was pro-life myself, i could never ever understand how someone can have the position that i just explained, but still have exceptions for rape or incest, it doesn't make any sense to me, morally its so inconsistent.

Whatever moral considerations and protections, etc, that you're giving to the fetus that was concieved from consensual sex, you have to give those same things to the fetus that was concieved from non-consensual sex too, morally and logically it doesn't make sense not to give it the same treatment, i just cannot see a way that you're able to excuse what you'd call the murder of a baby because of how it was concieved.

This is a bit besides the point, but having rape exceptions just sounds stupid because you're obviously gonna have to prove that the rape happened, and proving rape can be really hard.",123kallem,159,632,0.6399999856948853,0.1769006662457309,1731455218,/r/changemyview/comments/1gpz6d9/cmv_being_prolife_with_rape_and_incest_exceptions/,2024,11,changemyview,2024-11-12 23:46:58

1hksiq5,CMV: Reddit is a far left echo chamber.,"The general reputation of Reddit is that it leans very far to the left, and if you use it much at all, you can easily understand why. Many of the largest subreddits are filled with progressive or far-left takes, and the way the site functions tends to amplify those perspectives. While plenty of communities cater to other ways of thinking, the general culture of Reddit is slanted left. It's become sort of an echo chamber for those ideas, and alternative views really don't get much traction.

First off, many of the most popular subreddits on Reddit have to do with progressive or socialist issues. Places like r/politics, r/antiwork, and r/latestagecapitalism are filled with posts railing against capitalism, billionaires, and big corporations. The discussions go beyond just pointing out problems, too—they can get really extreme. You see and hear people quite vociferously saying that billionaires don't deserve to exist and calling CEOs-bankrupting industries for profit, specifically the ones dealing in healthcare-are something people say quite easily; from basic 'Billionaires deserves to lose everything' comments up to and including outright physical or other forms of suggested violence. These posts gain thousands of upvotes, so they are on the front page, reinforcing the leftist vibe.

The voting system on Reddit makes the echo chamber effect even worse. If someone posts a comment or opinion that doesn't fit the dominant narrative-like a conservative or moderate take-it's usually downvoted so hard it disappears. On the other side, everything that corresponds to the popular left-leaning view is upvoted and moved to the top. That means just one side of the argument is really seen, while opposing viewpoints get buried or ignored. Over time, this just discourages people with different perspectives from even bothering to engage. Why post something if it's just going to get downvoted into oblivion?

Then, of course, there is the huge role of moderation in giving shape to the overall tone of the platform. Large subreddits are run by their moderators, who are themselves often very left-leaning. They can be very quick to remove posts or ban users if they don't agree with the content, even when it doesn't break any rules. Such moderation makes a one-sided space where alternative viewpoints are not just unpopular but also actively suppressed. It's unsurprising that people view Reddit as a hostile place for anyone who doesn't align with progressive values.

Another reason has to do with the makeup of the site's users: The users go for a younger, more technologically hip audience that can easily go to the left on social issues and politics. Users interact and upvote this content as it speaks for their views, only to increase the presence of the left on this site. Now, for those right-leaning areas of Reddit-areas such as r/Conservative or r/libertarian-they exist but pale in size to the big left leaning behemoths.

At the end of the day, Reddit is not completely bereft of other viewpoints, but the way the site is structured makes it incredibly hard for them to be heard. From the voting system to the heavy-handed moderation to the demographics of the user base, Reddit has devolved into a leftist echo chamber where everything else is drowned out. No surprise there, really, when people think of it that way.

1hghe43,CMV: It's perfectly reasonable for a country to ban or severely restrict immigration from Islamic countries ,"I'm personally generally not a fan of religion. And I think Christianity is also problematic and contains a fair amount bigotry and sexism for example. However, I'd say in 2024 Islam is definitely by the far the most dangerous and most intolerant major religion in the world. Of course there are millions of Muslims who are reasonable people, who have fairly moderate or even progressive views, sure. But by and large the way Islam is being practiced today makes it the most intolerant and most dangerous major religion that exists.

A pretty large percentage of Muslims around the world hold beliefs that are extremely at odds with Western ideals such as democracy, liberty equality and human rights. According to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/#:~:text=Sharia%20as%20the%20Official%20Law%20of%20the%20Land&text=In%20South%20Asia%2C%20high%20percentages,%25) a very significant percentage of Muslims worldwide support Sharia law, and of those a significant percentage believe in things such as the death penalty for leaving Islam or stoning people for adultery. In almost every Muslim-majority homosexuality is illegal and in some it's even punished by death. Many Muslim majority countries have male guardianship laws, blasphemy laws and ex-Muslims in many Muslim countries would risk their lives if they openly came out as ex-Muslim.

And even many Muslims in the West continute to hold many of those extremely illiberal beliefs and ideas. According to a 2015 poll around half of all Muslims in the UK think homosexuality should be illegal, 39% believe a wife should always be obedient to her husband, and 23% support Sharia law. And many Islamic ideology not only has serious consequences for people in the Muslim community but also for society as a whole. The UK for example has a very high rate of forced marriages, the victims often being women from Muslim immigrant families, and the UK also has one of the highest rates of [honor-based violence and killings](https://www.jns.org/uk-honor-based-crimes-up-62-in-2-years/), much of that happening within the Muslim community.

But Islamic ideology also severely affects society as whole in non-Muslim countries. The vast majority of the most deadly terrorist attacks in Europe in the 21st centuries for example were commited by Islamic extremists. The Madrid train bombins, the Paris terror attacks, the Nice truck attack, the London bombins, the Brussels bombings, the Barcelona terror attack, the Manchester arena bombing, that's just a few of the terrorist attacks commited by Islamic extremists in Europe. Islamic ideology has a chilling effect on free speech, with the free press in Europe these days being afraid to publish material the Muslim word could see as offenseive after events like the Charlie Hebdo shooting where employees at a French satirical magazine were killed for saying publishing a caricature of the prophet.[ In the UK a teacher is still in hiding](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13276847/teacher-pupils-cartoon-prophet-mohammed-hiding.html) and fearing for his life, because he dared show students at his school a depiction of prophet Muhammed. I mean how far have we come if a teacher, not in Afghanistan, but in the UK must live in hiding, fearing for his life because they've offended the wrong people?

So in summary I think it's absolutely reasonable for a country to refuse to admit people who adhere to Islamic ideology. Many Muslims may have fairly moderate or even progressive views, and the majority of Muslims are peaceful people for sure. But given how much Islamic ideology has already affected many non-Muslim countries, no government should be expected to gamble with people's lives and admit millions of people from Muslim-majority countries, where inevitable a signficant percentage of those will likely turn out to hold beliefs and ideas that are extremely at odds with Western ideals like liberty and freedom.",RandomGuy92x,1461,1200,0.7400000095367432,0.6340288572995885,1734460517,/r/changemyview/comments/1hghe43/cmv_its_perfectly_reasonable_for_a_country_to_ban/,2024,12,changemyview,2024-12-17 18:35:17
1hc2wam,"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Biden’s legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure. ","Biden will be a historian’s president, loved in between the pages of a book but forgotten and disdained by your average Americans. I voted for Biden in 20 and Harris in 24’ but his presidency will be haunted by the shadow of defeat by trump. There’s no way around it.

1h44j71,CMV: Men and Women should ALWAYS be held to the same standard within any given job,"I was having a conversation with a woman about why more women aren't pilots and they had all these reasons why, and they said something that gave me pause. They said that in aviation everyone is held to the same standard but when giving the reasons why more women weren't in aviation, they didn't mention that maybe women simply can't or aren't willing to meet that standard. I think firefighting is another job where women are expected to meet the same standard as well.

In jobs such as the military, women are held to an objectively lower standard and arguably a lower subjective standard when it comes to discipline. This doesn't make sense to me as if someone is doing a specific job, regardless of their sex, there is a standard to do that job and I think everyone should be held to that standard period. This means one of two things for me:

1. If someone is unable to meet the standards required for the job then they just don't have the prerequisites required to accomplish the job and should not be hired.
2. If the standards are lowered so that a group of people are able to meet the requirements, then the standards should be lowered across the board because this shows that's the actual standard needed.

1hbydut,"CMV: Taxation is not theft. In fact, it is more akin to a modest admission ticket to participate in the economy.","I think a lot of people get their paycheck and see tax deductions and feel robbed. Like what do you mean my yearly salary is not actually how much I take home?"" Right? Libertarians make the the saying ""taxation is theft"" their rallying cry, often arguing that no taxation is acceptable, and the government should essentially disband or be at least decimated. 

I think this argument is intuitive to a lot of people because it does not feel like the benefits we get out of our tax dollars is not as valuable to us as the money would have been. When the average person thinks about how tax dollars benefit them they probably think about roads and maybe the mail or schools but not much else unless they receive government benefits like Medicaid or SNAP. In fact, the ways the government helps poor people are a lot more visible than the ways the might help everyone else. When poor people are essentially getting a monthly check from the government every month, I think it's easy for the average person to conclude that taxes are basically a scam to transfer money from working people to bums who don't work. 

But I think the benefit of tax dollars for the average American are actually much greater than we see at a glance, and the average American benefits from taxation far more than they lose because the government creates and manages the economic conditions that allow us to earn so much in the first place. 

Let's say you're a car salesman at a Toyota dealership. That dealership exists because cheap, safe trade is possible with Japan. This safe free trade is facilitated by the US military, which supports the defense of allies like Japan that could be invaded by China if the US were not an ally. If Japan were at war with China, the country might be blockaded, embargoed, or sanctioned by China in ways that make exports more expensive. Japan would also have to devote tremendous resources to their war effort. Domestic labor would be shorthanded and car manufacturing might have to be converted for war machines. If it were possible to get Toyota cars out at all, they would be more expensive. If China won the war they might impose trade restrictions on Japanese cars to the US to support its own vehicle industry. Also keep in mind the Japanese car industry only exists because the United States supported Japan's economic recovery after WW2 (with taxes), which created the Japanese economic miracle, which allows them to keep producing cheap cars. This relationship with Japan is only possible because the US won WW2 (with tax dollars). 

Imagine if FDR had been a penny pinching libertarian. He might have gone to war with Japan but would he have converted US industry to the extent necessary to win the war? Would he have raised taxes to fund the war effort if taxes are inherently theft? Or would he have negotiated for peace the moment he could secure non-aggression with Imperial Japan? Libertarian Truman certainly would never have approved funds to help Japan's economy recover. Libertarian FDR/Truman probably means no winning WW2, no Japanese economic miracle, no cozy trade relationship, which means no cheap cars in 2024. 

Your job selling cars at Toyota exists because of decisions made by the government 80 years ago supported by a tremendous tax burden, and tax dollars continuously spent to support that status quo. And besides you, customers benefit from cheap reliable cars. And the government collects tax revenue on the sales to make up for its expenses. This whole industry that benefits us all would not exist without the government spending money. This is how economies grow and create more wealth overall than existed before taxation.

While Toyota cars are maybe an easy example, there are so many other ways the government upholds the economy, such that this reasoning can apply to any job. Domestic cars? Made with imported steel and exported for profit that allows the company to grow and employ more people. Work at Walmart? Full of cheap imported goods. Bank? Insured by the government. Library? Government. Law? All about the government. Farm? Subsidized by the government. Healthcare? Majorly bloated with employees bc of the government. 

All of this is not to say that the government is perfect or that you should be ""thankful."" I am just arguing that we should recognize that the government is a necessary institution that requires taxes to work. Every day millions of Americans drive to work in Toyota cars on roads built and maintained by the government, kept safe by the government, to work in industries supported by the government, buy goods and services kept cheap by the government, and send their kids to schools provided at no cost by the government and wonder where all their tax dollars are going. Your tax dollars are all around you mate. 

And I know a lot of people are going to say this can all still exist with a free market and no government, but we have never seen that happen in the real world. Imagine what no government truly means. You would have to pay a toll of some sort to use a road if you did not build it yourself. You would have to pay a regular fee for police and fire protection. Your employer would not be required to provide healthcare, a bare minimum salary, or safe working conditions. You would be nickel and dimed at every turn so often that it would be just as bad as paying taxes or worse. And that's only assuming the inevitable corporate monopolies play nice and do not decide to simply enslave you. If a libertarian utopia were possible I just think it would have been accomplished by now. 

There are already places on earth in which there is no government. Haiti's government has collapsed. If you hate the government you can just move there. But it's a gang-controlled hell hole and nobody has the power to stop it except governments. People there are desperate. They would work for pennies to make iphones or flip flops or whatever but nobody can build a factory there because it would be taken over by gangs. Governments create order which creates economies which create wealth. You cannot have the economy and wealth without the government. All the government asks is a small fee in the form of taxes. 

Taxation is not theft, it is a small admissions fee to enjoy the robust, lucrative economy created and maintained by the government. Again, not perfect, but far better than the alternative. The lie that taxation is theft was created and circulated by rich people who know that less government means more power for them.

Im also aware Elon musks companies have provided great value to Americans. The fact that he has essentially infiltrated the American government to the point he is being suggested for speaker of the house is probably the most insane thing I’ve ever witnessed.

It is a textbook example of the worship of the wealthy and the unrestricted power of money in the US government.

In a proper functioning government, what he’s done so far would be illegal.

1hahwza,CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts.,"First off, I am not saying that we should be not shining a light on Israel's crimes, colonial aspirations and possible genocide.   
  
I'm curious as to why no one talks about UAE's involvement in South Sudan, a war that is just as colonial, is longer lasting and has resulted in the death, rape and misplacement of far far more civilians. The UAE has very close ties with the US and receives considerably military, logistic and financial support. Your tax dollars are funding the murder of millions of people in South Sudan.  
  
I've never seen anything on my feed or on any random subreddit about Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. Saudi receives weapons from the US and the UK (and others) and uses them against civilians, causing mass starvation and has resulted in far more deaths than in Gaza. It is currently the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe.   
  
Recently people have been posting about Israel invading parts of Western Syria and destroying chemical weapons facilities but I didn't see a single post when Turkey repeatedly invaded and occupied Northern Syria which they continue to do.   
  
In my view, it can't be lack on emotional bandwidth as all the aforementioned wars started long before the most recent invasion of Gaza. It can't be about colonialism as the UAE's ambitions in South Sudan are purely motivated by economic colonialization. It can't be about the West's support for Israel as we support the UAE just as much as we support Israel, President Mohammed bin Zayed recently visited the White House and Biden called the UAE a ""Major Defense Partner"". Every year they are growing closer with the US, the UK, etc  
  
Again, I'm not suggesting that that people shouldn't be posting about Israel's crimes, but if we care about human suffering, colonialism and our governments supporting awful regimes I should be seeing even more posts about UAE in South Sudan or Saudi Arabia in Yemen or Turkey in Syria.   
  
Is it purely ignorance or is it more sinister antisemitism or something else entirely?

1hjhy0n,"CMV: ""Believe all women"" is an inherently sexist belief","

Women can lie just as much as men. Women can have hidden agendas just as much as men. Women are just as capable as men of bringing frivolous lawsuits against men. At least, that's what the core principles of feminism would suggest. 

If it's innocent until proven guilty everywhere else, and we're allowed to speculate on accusations everywhere else... why are SA allegations different? Wouldn't that be special treatment to women and be... sexist? 

I don't want to believe all women blindly. I want to give them the respect of treating them as intelligent individuals, and not clump them in the ""helpless victim category"" by default. I am a sceptical person, cynical even, so I don't want to take a break from critical thinking skills just because it's an SA allegation. All crime is crime, and should ideally be treated under the same principle of 'innocent until guilty'. 

But the majority of the online communities tend to disagree, and very strongly disagree. So, I'm probably missing something here.

1hkrean,CMV: The man who set a woman alight on the New York subway deserves to die,"I never believed in capital punishment until today, but this guy single handedly converted me.

Burning someone to death is just about the worst thing you can do to them. It is the most excruciating way to die. 

Doing that to an innocent bystander is unconscionable. In fact, that's an understatement. There are no words to describe it. It's beyond comprehension. It's unspeakable.

This murder doesn't just deprive a woman of her life. It hurts every single woman on the planet. Every day, women have to live in ever greater fear of being attacked. This act compounds that problem and actually makes it more likely further attacks will occur. I would argue that everyone suffers as a consequence of that reality.

There are two reasons why the attacker should be tortured to death. 

Firstly, as a deterrent. You will make women - and the general population - safer by punishing this murderer. Something has to be done to protect women and a painful, inhumane death will go some way to achieving that. But all this pales in comparison to the second reason. That reason is retribution.

The world gains nothing from this man's existence. His continued being does nothing whatsoever to assuage any of the pain society experiences as a consequence of his actions. And it does nothing to address the extraordinary cost those actions inflicted on the victim.

From a utilitarian, never mind a moral perspective, there is an imperative to punish this man. The only way to do that - and the only way to gain any semblance of justice and utility from the situation - is to inflict the maximum amount of pain on him. At least then we can in some way alleviate the mental anguish and suffering of society as a whole.

I would actually argue that the man deserves to be tortured to death, but death at a minimum is more than justified.",idoze,690,670,0.8399999737739563,0.321975757093306,1734971296,/r/changemyview/comments/1hkrean/cmv_the_man_who_set_a_woman_alight_on_the_new/,2024,12,changemyview,2024-12-23 16:28:16

1hq867d,CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future.,"Hey, as the title says, I don't really think that much change in favor of progressive policies will come to the USA and the Democratic party. Mainly, it's about AOC losing her bid for the oversight committee to an old man with throat cancer and with all those old people in charge. Then, my thoughts have shifted more pessimistic towards the Democrats, that they're just Republican-lite, that they don't care about voters - just their wallets, that they benefit either way of they lose or win because they keep getting richer, that they will never change because it benefits them. I'm 17 years old, and I've done my fair share of volunteering for the Democrats. I've written letters and sent them to swing states, I've done door knocking, I volunteered with a local organization to get people to vote for the Democrats. I used to be blue to the core, obsessed with the past accomplishments of the Democratic party. I was (and still kind of am) obsessed with the New Deal, obsessed with the Great Society because I truly believe in their policies and I still thought that there is some semblance of the New Deal in the modern Democratic Party. But now I think the ones at the top of the Democrats just don't care about progress or what's good for the people, just their careers.

1hkwd3q,"CMV: The Democrats are not a ""right-wing"" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries.","This is something you here all the time on Reddit, and from people on the left generally, that the Democrats are actually a ""right-wing"" party on the international level and somehow their policies would be center right in other post-industrial democracies. People can arguable about the specifics of ""right-wing"" and ""left-wing"" so the more precise case I'm making is that the policy goals of the Democratic party are not out of step or somehow way further to the right compared to other mainstream, center-left parties in Europe or other Western democracies. If the policies of the Democratic party were transported to the United Kingdom or Germany, they would be much closer to Labour or the SPD and aren't going to suddenly fit right in with the Tories or the CDU. 

I will change my view if someone can read the [2024 Democratic platform](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FINAL-MASTER-PLATFORM.pdf) and tell me what specific policy proposals in there would not be generally supported by center-left parties in Europe or other Western democracies. 

In 2020, Biden ran on a platform that included promises like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, providing universal pre-k, making community college and public four year universities free, creating a public option for health insurance, among other things. Biden's primary legislative accomplishments were passing massive fiscal stimulus through the American Rescue Plan and infrastructure law and a major subsidies for green energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. He also expended a bunch of political capital on a plan for widespread student loan forgiveness that even other Democratic politicians conceded went beyond the scope of the Executive Branch's powers. I don't see how any of these things can be considered remotely right-wing. Even left-wing commentators like Ezra Klein at the New York Times have said that the Biden administration has been the most progressive administration ever in American history.

I think the assertion that Democrats are ""right-wing"" is mostly the result of people fundamentally misunderstanding the major differences between the American political system and the parliamentary systems practices in most other western democracies. The filibuster makes it so, that in practice, any major policy proposal requires bipartisan support. The last time the Democrats had a filibuster proof majority was back in 2009, which they promptly lost in like a year after a special election in Massachusetts. With their filibuster proof majority, the Democrats used it to pass the Affordable Care Act. Say what you will about the ACA, you can believe it didn't go far enough, but I don't really see how it be remotely construed as ""right-wing.""

Meanwhile, the majority party in most parliamentary systems is able to pass pretty much whatever they want with a 50%+1 majority, provided they can get their party/coalition in line. The logic people seem to employ when they argue that the Democrats are right-wing are they identify progressive policies that America doesn't have that other countries do have like single-payer healthcare, universal parental leave, etc and then reason backwards to conclude that the Democrats must be right-wing. But the Democrats explicitly call for many of these policies in their party platform, it's just virtually impossible to pass most of these things because of the Senate filibuster. 

As an additional note about healthcare, it's worth pointing out that many European countries do not have nationalized, single-payer systems use a mix of private and public healthcare options. The big examples are Germany and Switzerland. Even countries with single-payer systems like Canada still use private health insurance for prescription drugs and dental work. Just because the Democrats seem confused on whether they want to whole-heartedly embrace as Sanders style ""medicare for all"" isn't prima facia evidence that the party would somehow be right-wing in Europe. 

Finally, the Democratic party is arguably much further to the left on many social issues. One of the biggest examples is abortion. It's not clear what, if any, restrictions on abortion that Democratic party endorses. In states that have a Democratic trifecta in the governor's mansion and supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature, abortions are often effectively legal at any point, provided you can find a sympathetic doctor to provide a ""good-faith"" medical judgement that completing the pregnancy would harm the health of the mother. 

The viability standard set in Casey of around 24 weeks gave the US a significantly more generous timeframe to get an elective abortion, whereas most European countries cap it [around 12 weeks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1268439/legal-abortion-time-frames-in-europe/). Many European countries also require [mandatory counseling or waiting periods](https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/European-abortion-law-a-comparative-review.pdf) before women can get abortions, something the Democrats routinely object to. For comparison, the [position](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/europe/germany-abortion-recommendation-intl/index.html) of the Germany's former left-wing governing coalition was the abortions up until 12 weeks should be available on demand, provided the woman receives mandatory counseling and waits for three days. If a Republican state set up that standard in the US, the democrats would attack it relentlessly as excessively draconian, which is precisely what they've done to North Carolina, which has an extremely similar [abortion law](https://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/en/abortion-guide-access) on the books.",ThePurpleNavi,358,890,0.6100000143051147,0.2854252826126643,1734984967,/r/changemyview/comments/1hkwd3q/cmv_the_democrats_are_not_a_rightwing_party_and/,2024,12,changemyview,2024-12-23 20:16:07
1hedrsk,CMV: circumcision is child abuse,"I believe that it is child abuse to cut on the genitals of baby boys and that it should be illegal to cut on boys genitals 

The common counter arguments are religious freedom parental rights that cutting on boys genitals is medicine and the it’s legal argument 

I will address all the objections that I’m aware of 

1. As far as religious freedom I don’t believe religious freedom includes the “right” to carve your religion onto someone else’s body regardless of what holy book people quote the boy’s bodily autonomy and bodily integrity outweighs this

2. In regards to “parental rights” I don’t believe in the concept at all parents shouldn’t be allowed to do whatever they want to their children just cause “parental rights” if a parent produces child porn of thier kids they would rightfully be behind bars for their actions it wouldn’t matter if the parent who produced child porn used “parental rights” as a defense 

Likewise parents should be prohibited from being able to cut on the genitals of baby boys and people should be able to take their parents to court for having their genitals cut on without thier consent 

3. The most common “defense” for circumcision being “medicine” is the AAP statement which has been expired for years and the AAP did not renew the policy endorsing circumcision and when it was in effect the other pediatric organizations that weren’t in the United States condemned it as a culturally biased paper

And there’s an entire industry that makes billions of dollars from cutting on the genitals of baby boys and use them for biotech companies 

4. Just because it’s legal to cut on the genitals of baby boys does not mean people should do so slavery used to be a legal practice in the USA as well the fact that it’s legal only indicates who is in power not that it’s justified to cut on babies genitals

Not to mention anti cannabis laws did not stop people from advocating to legalize cannabis 

Anti abortion laws don’t stop people from advocating for legalizing abortion 

Pro abortion laws don’t stop people from advocating to make abortion illegal 

Likewise the fact that it’s legal to cut on the genitals of baby boys is not going to stop intactivists from advocating to make it illegal to cut on the genitals of baby boys and pressing for every single piece of legislation that makes it more difficult for circumcisions to happen such as defunding circumcision adding more burdens on the hospital so that they are like it’s not profitable anymore to cut on boys genitals etc.",flashliberty5467,440,773,0.6600000262260437,0.2807769799785779,1734213879,/r/changemyview/comments/1hedrsk/cmv_circumcision_is_child_abuse/,2024,12,changemyview,2024-12-14 22:04:39
1hk3zlc,CMV: Child Abuse is more tolerated from nonwhite families than it is from white ones.,"I know that there is plenty of abuse from white families here in western countries. However at least for the most part we as a society condemn it (Rightfully so) and see it as horrible parenting. However child-abuse is always talked about and condemned in terms of white parents. When it comes to parents from other countries and cultures, like Hispanics, Asians, and Indians just to name a few, it's talked about more casually and not condemned as much due to it being ""part of their culture"" (seriously look up videos and shorts on you-tube of people from other cultures casually joking about how their parents beat them and emotionally, and verbally abused them). I'm not trying to be ignorant or stereotype other people's culture but why are we so tolerant of abuse from nonwhite people, instead of condemning it. Also we see a good chunk of white people cut contact with their abusive parents when they reach adulthood (again rightfully so) however that rate is nowhere near the same with Minority kids as a good chunk of them I've seen online actually spend time, and act all friendly with their parents as if they forgot what they put them through and some of them even excuse it as ""they just showed their love in a different way"". This baffles and horrifies me to say the least.

1h9o6wr,CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term.,"Before I present my case, I want to get two things out of the way. One, I am a Democrat who voted for Kamala Harris, so I would very much like to be wrong. Two, this analysis does not take into account the possibility that no future elections are held. While I'm not convinced US elections are over forever, half of Reddit seems to be. Anyway, here's why I believe the Democrats are fucked even if democracy remains intact.

The 2024 election should have been a lay-up for Kamala Harris. Biden and Trump were both historically unpopular nominees, so much so that a man changed his legal name to ""Literally Anybody Else"" and ran a joke campaign. Biden was replaced by Harris in July, leading to tons of enthusiasm and small-dollar donations on the Democratic side. The economy was (and is) doing considerably better than in most other countries, including wealthy European nations. Most importantly, her opponent was a senile old man whose inaction led to the deaths of over a million people in the United States alone, was the only head of state to deny climate change, and tried to overthrow the government on his way out. Despite having the easiest possible set of circumstances with which to win a presidential election, *she still lost.*

Furthermore, rural voters are never going to vote for Democrats again. Local media, commonly cited as an antidote to polarization, has shriveled up, to be replaced by right-wing talk radio. Now, if Democrats could lose those areas by 30 points instead of 50 points, that would go a long way in the swing states. However, they don't just need swing states to remain viable as a national party (more on that later). Additionally, the 2024 election saw urban centers, people of color, and many other demographics that traditionally vote for Democrats swing violently rightward. As a 24-year-old man myself, I'm shocked but not surprised that Trump outright won men under 30. And I don't think they're coming back, because the Democrats won't embrace alternative media - there will never be a left-wing Joe Rogan. If the Democrats can't make up ground in rural areas, but also lose core parts of their base, they are doomed.

The situation is even more dire in the Senate, especially important because the Senate is the only chamber that can confirm or block nominees to the judiciary. Even with a 47-seat minority, the Democrats will still control both seats in several states that voted for Trump in this election. This includes both Arizona seats in a state Trump won by more than 5 percentage points. In other words, the Democrats are far more likely to lose Senate seats than to gain them in the long term. Even in the short term, the Democrats have just two pick-up opportunities in 2026 Senate - North Carolina (which has remained elusive for Democrats at the federal level since 2008!) and Maine (in which the unbeatable Susan Collins is likely to run again). Even if the Democrats can elect a President, they can only do so much without the Senate on their side, and if the judiciary gets right-wing enough, they will start green-lighting even more egregious voter suppression than we've already seen, which will eventually make it virtually impossible for Democrats to win again.

Finally, let's look at the media. In a craven display of anticipatory obedience, the Washington Post infamously did not endorse Kamala Harris this year. To make matters worse, MSNBC's Morning Joe (the channel of choice for the #Resistance) is already sucking up to Trump because they fear he'll try to shut them down. Trump would be foolish to shut them down, of course, because they're perhaps more responsible than anyone else for him returning to power. But in the period between the 2016 election and Trump's inauguration, I remember there being a lot more protests among both Democratic lawmakers and Democratic civilians than I see this time. That could partly be because the Kyle Rittenhouse precedent allows white vigilantes to murder protestors and get away with it, in which case I don't blame people for being too scared to protest. But the Democrats seem demoralized rather than angry, which is why I don't think they will engage in the necessary activism to resist Trump's worst policies.

1hcxwer,CMV: Reddit's male spaces are completely broken and no longer represent men at all.,"I genuinely want someone to try change my mind on this because it's such a disparaging thought.

I've recently had a bit of an experience in r/askmenadvice that really irked me. I have found myself on the receiving end of the bullshit and seen some things I really don't like about collective male behaviour on Reddit.

Here's an example thread (on mobile so I'll edit with the link in a sec.

I have literally just been trying to argue my point that these spaces are public despite having 'men' in the name, and that we should be kinder and more considerate. There are 1000+ people reading even 0 upvote posts, who may be damaged by the casual women bashing that is so common, and many people have admitted to me that women should expect. They are extremely unlikely to participate because of the backlash.

These loud few boys do not take any accountability for how their actions affect other people. I do not care how old they are, they are simply not emotionally men yet if that's how they think. I appreciate that they are hurting, but choosing not to grow up has never been and will never be a successful strategy for coping with the real world.

In my opinion, men take responsibility. This is true for every happily married man I know IRL.

Approx 95% of the 'men' I've interacted with in these spaces are telling me the following:

1. I'm too angry/emotional with my argument - which implies my opinion as a man is invalid (feeling my emotions does not scare me now I've sought therapy)
2. That vulnerable people should not access these spaces if they can't handle it (that doesn't change that they still will)

Particularly concerning is that the sub descriptions openly have rules like 'be nice' and say that men are keen to open up their feminine side.

Staying cold and distant ain't the way to do it. Becoming a man for me has been all about understanding my emotions and exercising them helpfully.

Things that will CMV:

- Examples of reddit male spaces that aren't like this
- Genuine discussion of where my cognitive dissonance may lie on the matter

Things that will not CMV:

- Being told I am being dramatic/too angry/emotional about this. I feel very passionately about this and I will not censor myself when I've just expressed an opinion that I feel most men IRL share with me.
- Being told that's just the way it is, and I should ignore it. I believe that men can moderate ourselves and take responsibility better.

From my perspective, while I appreciate people need to vent to heal, Male Reddit is making things much, much worse. It's actually become a barrier to proper growth for anyone who interacts with them regularly and thinks it's normal.

So please CMV, because I am clearly hurting about this in the dark somewhat and I'd like to see the light.",ponderous_pete,352,623,0.6100000143051147,0.2256255123984014,1734044275,/r/changemyview/comments/1hcxwer/cmv_reddits_male_spaces_are_completely_broken_and/,2024,12,changemyview,2024-12-12 22:57:55
1hhai1y,CMV: No amount of gun violence deaths will result in political change and people should stop expecting it,"Every time there' is a major mass casualty incident in the United States caused by a firearm you constantly see people saying that it will be a ""Wakeup call"" and that it will somehow inspire change.

You can change my view if you convince me that people don't say that or don't believe it.

My view is that there is no specific amount of people that have to die in order to inspire meaningful change or legislation. Even after the Mandalay Bay Massacre in Las Vegas when 59 people were killed and more than 500 others injured, nothing happened.

You can change my view if you can convince me that there is a certain number that would inspire change.

The people who have the ability to make change simply don't care. They could put the effort in, but the deaths of everyday Americans does not justify that effort for them. They will continue to get elected no matter what, so they don't bother. Why hurt their political career when they could just sit in office and focus on other issues. Of course there are other important issues, so they can go handle those instead.

You can change my view if you can convince me that they do care. 

The people who have the ability to make a change will never be in danger of being impacted by gun violence. Politicians at high levels are protected, and at low levels usually come from privileged positions and will never face the threat of gun violence. They might deeply care about the issue, of have loved ones affected, but they themselves will never face that danger or experience fear of gun violence so they simply won't act. It doesn't apply to them. 

You can change my view if you can convince me that gun violence does impact politicians.

To conclude, no amount of dead Americans will inspire meaningful change. No amount of dead kids will make the politicians care. No amount of blood will make them act, unless of course it's blood of their own.

1h4rlyl,CMV: Forced conscription is inherently wrong,"This is a topic that recently came up again in the context of the Ukraine war so here's my take: Forcing people into frontline service is inherently and always immoral. I have a few reasons for believing this 

1. Sending someone into war with 2 weeks of training is very likely to get that person killed. So knowingly doing so is essentially equivalent to manslaughter

2. It's a violation of bodily autonomy

3. The state should serve the people and not the other way around. The reason why a state exists is to enable large numbers of people to live together in relative peace and prosperity.

1hettt0,CMV: The New Jersey Drone’s are just mass hysteria.,"People are seeing planes and helicopters, maybe some small recreational drones from hobbyists.

I was really interested in this issue at first, however I noticed a reoccurring theme: nearly every time someone posts a photo or video of the “smoking gun” everyone goes “holy shit!” for the first hour or so. After that, someone figures out it’s an exact match for a helicopter, or a plane that was near the airport. It takes too long for a positive ID, and by the time it’s found everyone’s moved on to the next smoking gun- leading to many threads with the vast majority of comments freaking out about the phenomenon, burying comments that solve what it actually is.


Here’s the thing: I want to be wrong. I want to feel the magic of the drone invasion again. Someone change my view on this, because currently I believe this is a wave of mass hysteria that’s leaking into other states as more and more people see the “drones”.",toadwideweb,541,365,0.7799999713897705,0.2174588241258569,1734273403,/r/changemyview/comments/1hettt0/cmv_the_new_jersey_drones_are_just_mass_hysteria/,2024,12,changemyview,2024-12-15 14:36:43

1hezsg8,CMV: Misandry isn’t Feminism,"This is something that in recent years both me and feminist friends find bothersome within the movement, and getting out of hand.

With the number of Feminism support declining, and people hating on Feminism, as well as Feminists exiting the movement, many couldn’t help but think where and how it went wrong.

Feminism is a movement that used to be about Women rights, but it never truly meant hating on men or becoming the same oppressive monsters “who think they know better for both sexes” as men once used to be towards women, making women not having the right to vote, etc. etc.

Feminism as it went forward after those past achievements, was all about one thing: Opposing PATRIARCHY and it’s rules or teachings, introducing instead more loving and empathetic ones instead. Not opposing men. Understanding that both men and women suffer under it, and wanting to free humanity from it.

But yet despite the benevolence in that… Feminism faced an insane amount of hate and opposition all over the world, and if you listen to the reasons why, you wouldn’t be surprised.

That’s when it dawned on me.

*The public hates Misandrists. Not Feminists.*

It is likely that despite the benevolence of Feminism, a population of Misandrist saw Feminism as an “excuse” to spread Misandry equal to the level of toxicity of the patriarchy and Misogyny.
Possibly turning into the very same monsters that real Feminism tried to liberate women from, except this time focusing on men.

In that sense, Misandry paints Feminism the bad image that many people all over the world sadly mistake it for. 

Instead of being a movement on love, equality, and liberation, the hatred that Patriarchy-induced Misandry brings into such “Feminism” brings the movement unironically closer towards the Patriarchy and it’s teachings, than against it.

Feminism is about gender equality. Empathy, not tyranny. Harmony and love for all, not hate.

I would rather call this type of Feminism the “Matriarchy”, which reflects more traits and behaviors in common with the toxicity of the Patriarchy. 
Rather than Feminism.",DittoBurrito123,217,653,0.6899999976158142,0.1977867279725111,1734289787,/r/changemyview/comments/1hezsg8/cmv_misandry_isnt_feminism/,2024,12,changemyview,2024-12-15 19:09:47

1h8x7bt,"CMV: The solution to police misconduct in the US isn’t defunding, but ramping up training/requiring a 4 to 6 year degree.","For context, this isn’t to dismiss a very real and longstanding issue of police forces abusing their power in various parts of the United States, or civil asset forfeiture, or the increase in militarization we’ve seen due to the Pentagon’s 1033 Military Equipment Lending program to police departments.

However, a few years ago, post-2020, I had the idea of a *Four Year Force* Program as a possible win-win for police reform advocacy.

The basic idea is it’d be a kind of GI Bill for people looking to join the police force (ie a free ride). 

There’d be a standardized, baseline federal curriculum for aspiring police officers, which would include:
- firearms discipline
- physical fitness benchmarks
- deescalation and negotiation training, and 
- civil rights 101

It’d also be part of an ordinary bachelor’s degree, so they’d be among other students and not separate from the population they might one day serve. Officers looking to join SWAT or similar would need 2 years of additional training.

That’s the basic idea, borne out from my concluding the lack of training an high stakes is mostly why we see what we see.

1hn0ahj,Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor,"Illegal immigration causes competition for housing and wages among the poorest Americans. It creates downward pressure on wages and working conditions.

They are pretty much exploited by default. Immigrants on work visas are already exploited enough.

Every single study I have read on the matter says that illegal immigration provides a net benefit to the economy, but the ones that go into the details find that it's the wealthy people that receive the benefit by exploiting the workers more. The working class is generally negatively impacted by this, even if the economy does better overall

There is, at the same time, no real benefit we provide the world on a meaningful scale by accepting refugees. There are specific, local scenarios where we can absolutely have a meaningful impact by accepting refugees. 

The best example of this has been how we accept Haitians. There's been general bipartisan support for accepting these people as refugees, and even Trump extended the protections first doled out by Obama after the earthquake

However, when everyone tries to claim asylum, the alternative means of entering the US that was necessary for these Haitians after their airport was shut down was made not viable. 

The only people who truly benefit off of Illegal immigration are the wealthy that exploit them for their labor

I hate the idea that we profit off the exploitation of a lower class of people

1h671rd,CMV: it’s not “disrespectful” or bigoted to incorrectly eat or prepare ethnic food under most circumstances,"So, let me start by saying that I do get where the other side of this issue is coming from. I’m Greek American. People incorrectly eat our food quite often. From putting dill in tzatziki (maybe some Greeks do that but no Greek owned restaurant I’ve ever been to has, nor has my family or any family I know and have eaten with), to honey mustard chicken gyros, and more. I find it annoying. However, that doesn’t mean I have a right to tell other people how they want to eat food on their plate.

If someone wants to eat a honey mustard chicken gyro or put dill in their tzatziki, go for it. Who am I to judge? If you enjoy your food, that’s what matters most.

That being said, I can see some exceptions to this. For example, if a friend is trying to introduce you to their culture through food, I’d recommend eating and preparing the food how it’s meant to be eaten and prepared. That being said, that isn’t really about cultural respect as much as it is about respecting your friend.

The other argument for the other side that I’ve heard is that there are reasons why food is prepared certain ways in certain cultures, normally for health and practical reasons. And, I get that. But, I’d argue that as long as you’re not really harming anyone, it’s fine.

I guess there’s also the argument that the food item comes from a culture consisting of people of color or oppressed groups. In which case, it’s harder for me to speak on that because I am white. But, I’d again argue that there isn’t really any harm done? If anyone has a different perspective, feel free to share it.

1hfn4kf,Cmv: Trying to be manly is ironically very unmanly,"This is a specific type of person. Guys who try desperately to be manly “alpha” men, who are very insecure about how others see them and become very emotional if anyone dares think they are not mr macho man are ironically very unmanly. They cannot do something which they consider “feminine” because they are manly men what if someone sees them. They are slaves to gender stereotypes and society. They have to try to look as “manly” as possible and anyone who does not look like that is automatically less of a man to them. What is manly is obviously not always universally defined, but going off gender stereotypes, i feel that caring so hard about being manly is not very manly. It is also the same kind of guy who is always becoming so angry at everything and yet says that men are not emotional as if anger is not an emotion. 

I feel as if being brave enough to truly be your authentic self in the world without trying to be manly and just being who you are is what is actually manly.

1hjhtug,CMV: The 2020s has been and will be viewed as a terrible decade ,"My overall feelings on the 2020s decade will be no more or less different from the majority of people when I say that of all the decades that has transpired throughout modern time, this decade has, by far, been a consistent disaster, one after another, with a general pessimistic vibe that even in future retrospects, it will be objectively viewed as an unlikable era that will never be looked back at fondly. I will admit that despite the past decades' major downsides, they are viewed much more favorably based on various statements, regardless of the age group – from the amount of analysis I had conducted in my research, it is immensely rare to hear about how decades such as the 1980s and the 1990s are viewed negatively in the same vein as the 2020s; the disdain for the latter couldn't be more overstated as I had underwent personal struggles with anxiety and depression from recent current events. Even when I struggled from my mental disability in my childhood, I still viewed the past rather fondly. Granted, there is a theoretical chance that I could be just viewing the past with 'rose-tinted glasses', I find it to be practically impossible to imagine the 2020s to be viewed so fondly in retrospects given the overly negative reception with many past events in comparison.

So far, the 2020s decade has given people the pandemic and its after-effects within society, political unrest along with radical polarization, increased social isolation leading to depression and increased risks of suicide, the gradual erosion of democracy with cases such as Afghanistan and Myanmar, inflation along with massive corporate consolidation over housing, multiple genocides and wars, the countless mass shootings happening within the United States, skyrocketing cost of living, the increasing gap of wealth gap inequality, erosion of certain rights such as abortion, greenhouse gas emissions have increased global average temperatures, and that’s only to list a few. I understand that horrible events in the past have happened as well - it's just that so much bad has happened from this decade alone that it seems to make the events of the past pale in comparison.  I just find that the world, let alone this decade, is seemingly bleak and will not be looked back at admirably with the exception of the young adolescents and individuals that have been raised in a high class privileged lifestyle.

Ideally, there is testimony from research groups backed up by data that society as a whole is supposedly better off than before from the decrease of extreme poverty, fewer people dying in conflicts in recent decades than in most of the 20th century, the ever-advancing medical treatments against fatal illnesses, increased life expectancy along with decreased child mortality rate; those aspects are taken for granted admittedly. However, the general vibe that I have felt recently is anything but positive – I noticed that people are generally depressed overall due to various factors that have been listed. I read that the same group of adults aged 18-35 in general will note that their time in certain past decades that they lived in at that time positively whereas another group of adults within the same age bracket will persistently state that the 2020s is a terrible time to be living in. Even from reading about older generations that have lived through certain rough times with the Great Depression, the World Wars, the looming threat of the Cold War, segregation, apartheid, communism with Eastern Europe, the Vietnam War, the AIDS epidemic that those periods of time, they would state that this time of era is even worse than they they lived through which really puts the 2020s in such a negative light.

To put it in layman's terms, I am filled with confidence that the 2020s is generally despised now and that it will never be - this decade's overall vibe and reception will be no different than the 1930s.

1hp76ya,"CMV: Eating meat is a natural part of the food chain, and humans are fulfilling their role in nature by doing so.","The food chain is one of the most fundamental principles of nature, and every living creature plays a role in it. Lions eat meat, tigers eat meat, eagles eat meat, and humans eat meat too. This process is not a deviation from nature but an essential part of it. Just as lions hunt gazelles or eagles catch fish, humans consume both plants and animals to sustain themselves.

I believe humans were created by God with the ability to eat meat, and this is reflected in how we are designed. Our bodies, with teeth suited for both grinding plants and tearing meat, and digestive systems capable of processing a wide variety of foods, clearly show that eating both plants and animals is natural for us. From the earliest days of humanity, people hunted and ate meat as part of their survival. Over time, this relationship with meat became a cornerstone of human life, providing essential nutrients and energy.

Some might argue that humans have the choice not to eat meat, but I don’t think avoiding meat is a more ethical decision. Eating meat is neither unethical nor unnatural—it is simply a part of how God created us to live. Just as lions and eagles follow their instincts to eat meat, humans are also fulfilling their natural role by doing the same. Saying that humans should stop eating meat because we can is, in my opinion, like suggesting lions should stop hunting because they might adapt to eating plants.

This analogy also helps illustrate the deeper point: all creatures are part of a cycle. Sheep eat grass, humans eat sheep, and the energy continues to flow through the natural world. This interconnected system is how the world was created to function, and humans are not exempt from it. Participating in this cycle is not only natural but essential for balance.

I see no conflict between eating meat and being part of the natural world. We are creatures like any other, placed on Earth to live according to the system God created. It is no more unnatural for humans to eat meat than it is for a bird of prey to catch a rabbit. This is not a question of morality but of nature and design.

I understand that some may have personal reasons for choosing not to eat meat, but I do not believe this makes them morally superior. Just as a lion is not “wrong” for eating a gazelle, humans are not “wrong” for eating animals. It’s simply the way life works.

I’m curious to hear other perspectives and see if anyone can offer arguments that might change my view. Can someone help me see this differently?",ZookeepergameFit2918,144,581,0.6000000238418579,0.1634790770235831,1735509905,/r/changemyview/comments/1hp76ya/cmv_eating_meat_is_a_natural_part_of_the_food/,2024,12,changemyview,2024-12-29 22:05:05

1hpuw7y,"CMV: ""YYYY-MM-DD"" is a superior date format to ""DD-MM-YYYY""","You may have seen [this meme](https://imgur.com/5dYgqoE.png) before, explaining why the ""DD-MM-YYYY"" date format (commonly used in America) is superior to the ""MM-DD-YYYY"" format (commonly used in the US).  However, I think that it misses the mark a lot, and both of those formats are inferior to one that puts the year first, then the month, then the date (e.g. ""2024-12-30"")

I think this format is better than the other two for a few reasons:

* It matches how people normally express numbers.  Typically we express numbers in a way that is [Big Endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness); we say the largest magnitude part of the number first, then descending down to the smallest part.  For example, if you want to write the number five million and one, you would write it as 5,000,001.  You start with the ""5"" (which has the biggest magnitude, since it counts millions) and end with the ""1"" (since it has the smallest magnitude and counts ones).  The DD-MM-YYYY date format flips this (kind of, see below) and starts with the smallest magnitude and goes to the largest.

* When I said it flips it, that's only kind of true.  The numbers are still big-endian for each individual part of the date.  For example, writing the current year as ""2024"" is big-endian.  It starts with the 2 (which represents thousands of years, the largest magnitude piece of information), followed by the ""0"" for hundreds, the next ""2"" for tens, and then the ""4"" for ones.  It's big-endian, descending magnitude.  And the month and date parts are also big-endian.  So when you write with DD-MM-YYYY, you don't really end up with a big-endian or small-endian date format.  It's a small-endian collection of individual date parts which are themselves big-endian, resulting in a mixed-endian result where the magnitudes go up and down (much like the pyramid on the right side of the meme posted at the top).

* If you add in time-of-day, it becomes even more clear that you're going up and down in terms of magnitude.  We write time of day in HH:MM:SS format.  As far as I know, there's no country where SS:MM:HH is preferred.  This is big-endian, starting with the largest magnitude and then moving down from there.  If you list the date in ""DD-MM-YYYY"" format, and include the time, then you're always going to have a format where it goes up and down.  Either ""HH:MM:SS DD-MM-YYYY"" or ""DD-MM-YY HH:MM:SS""  Both of these are ""out of order pyramids"" in the illustration above.

* ""YYYY-MM-DD"" also has the nice advantage in the fact that, if you sort filenames or other pieces of data in a simple alphanumeric way, then you are also putting them in chronological order.  The other two date formats don't have this.

Ultimately, the only advantage that I can think of that DD-MM-YYYY has over YYYY-MM-DD is ""but it's what some people are already used to, so why change?"", which is incidentally the exact same reason people choose MM-DD-YYYY over DD-MM-YYYY.

1hm1w21,CMV: People telling you to see obese people as people is not promoting obesity,"I am sick and fucking tired of the thinkpieces I see in here! The body positivity movement was created to tell overweight people that they should not hate themselves. If they wanted to promote obesity, they would only spread excessive mukbang content, but that clearly isn't the case. To say fat people are human and deserve to be treated with basic fucking respect is not a radical thought. Some of the most unhealthy eaters I know with high cholesterol, high blood pressure, pre diabetes, GERD, and perspiration issues are skinnier than me or socially acceptable. I know a woman whose who diet is Cheetos and mac and cheese. Girl is so backed up and constipated, she literally poops once a week and it is one giant hard log. Yet when we are next to each other, people unsolicitedly compare our bodies. 

Most fat people you'll meet are on a weight loss journey and I wish people were kinder. No wonder there was a body positivity movement. People are so freaking mean to fat people for existing! How do folks have an issue with other people's weight, idk. 

Unless you are a doctor or trainer, you shouldn't have anything to say about anyone's weight. Also, fat people deserve to smile and not have to deal with people being assholes. And if other people are being assholes, fat people have a right to ignore them and smile anyway.


Lil Segway below:


Sadly, I reached this conclusion when I became overweight. I was on meds and had deep depression so I ballooned from a solid 160 to 200 in the span of 4 to 5 years. To see the treatment I am receiving is jarring. I went from eating what I want to people micromanaging my food intake. I'll never forget when I got over a weight plateau and celebrated (lost 10 lbs) only for someone to come in and call me fat within hours and how I need to lose weight. Then for me to finally fit in a dress that I couldn't wear for over a year and still be told, ""You need to stop eating so much, you need to start exercising."" The ironic thing is that I was, which is why I could fit in more clothes lmfao. 

I've actively been eating less and spacing out my meals. My one dinner has become dinner for night one and night two. My breakfast has been spread out where half is breakfast and the other half is lunch. I do struggle with eating late because tbh I never finish my meals throughout the day, yet because I have a belly, I'm dragged for it. Plus it made me realize that people don't know what weight looks like. I've weighed myself before family dinners and I am the same exact weight as when I saw them months ago. Yet I walk in the door and people are yelling at me that I got fatter and need to stop eating. I'm glad the body positivity movement exists because I'm not going to let people make me feel like shit for being overweight right now, but I'm just tired.

1hfv9u7,CMV: Ukraine is probably headed for a defeat in the Russo-Ukrainian war,"I've been following the war in Ukraine since the Russian military buildup in 2021, and at this point I think Ukraines odds of winning are slim to none.
Ukraine's strategy in the past year or so has hinged on defending fortified cities like Vuhledar and attriting the Russian forces to create a bloody stalemate, after which Ukraine could build up their forces to match or potentially outmatch Russian forces. However, they've been consistently driven out of their fortified cities, with Avdivka and Torersk being some of the most notable instances of this. Ukrainian defense near Pokrovsk are currently struggling under the Russian offensive, and if Pokrovsk falls, Ukraine has no fortified position behind that for quite a distance, forcing them to either give up large chunks of land or defend open and unfortified ground.

The AFU is not in great shape either. Their premier units, like the 47th Mechanized, have been whittled down to a shell of their former selves as attrition takes a major toll on them. Their rank and file is not doing much better, as many of their units around Pokrovsk are at less than 40% strength according to Pravda UA: https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/articles/2024/09/17/7475408/#

The Russian military, meanwhile, has a formidable artillery advantage and has begun catching up to Ukraine in the quantity and quality of FPV drones they’ve been using. Incentivized by large cash bonuses and salaries, Russian volunteers are currently signing up in huge numbers, ensuring that addition does not decimate the Russian army. While the Russian economy is struggling, there is no indication that anybody in the Kremlin is considering ending the war due to the economy. Countries rarely end wars due to economic pressure in the first place. For example, both World Wars bankrupted the British Empire entirely, but they never surrendered until all of their objectives had been achieved. In fact, among Russia’s political elite, the main complaint has been that Putin has not mobilized the economy and populace more. If you remember the Wagner revolt, Prigozhins complaint was that Putin was not producing enough ammunition to fuel the war effort. 

So based on what I’ve said above, I think Ukraine cannot reclaim their occupied territories, and I think their situation is likely to worsen. I also believe Russia is not going to simply give up and go home, as the Russian political elite are in lockstep around supporting the war.

1hgjslt,CMV: There is nothing wrong in seeking escorts if you can't get laid,"Lots of conventionally unattractive or socially awkward men nowadays struggle to get female attention all their lives and it can continue well into late 20s. Dating apps have made things worse and further ruins their already fragile confidence. I myself have faced this and know quite a few people who do so as well. It stings when you do a lot to improve yourself, dress well but barely make any actual progress while someone with a jawline and extra few inches (vertical, not horizontal) get attention even while wearing a potato sack and looking like they haven't shaved in years.

People will say you have a shitty attitude, try to put the blame on you, call you insecure but dont believe everything they say. Nonetheless, the only way to let go of this bitterness is to accept that most women are spoilt for choices nowadays (again, fault of men only for being down to fuck anyone with a pulse) and they have a right to set  their standards, even ones who you think are conventionally unattractive themselves. There is nothing wrong if she chooses who she wants from her options. You are not entitled to affection or sex or anything really. Women don't owe you a thing.

Now coming to escort services, it is a perfectly valid alternative if you have enough money to spare. Best is to go for independent escorts only, without any middleman involved. No one should be shamed for entering into such a transactional relationship. The only concerned parties are you and the woman. Its completely understandable if you don't want to deprived of any sexual contact throughout your 20s (or more, god forbid) for reasons beyond your control and you feel these services are the only option left.

Trust me, you will feel better and lead a better life as long you don't get carried away. Its far better than letting bitterness and despair consume you. Do what's best for you. Try not get swayed by people (irl or online) who try to convince you that you are a bad person or misogynist or whatever for engaging in such practices. They are not in your shoes. Your life is not the same as them. They don't care if you remain a virgin. You are not guaranteed to be ""rewarded"" with anything if you go about things the ""right"" way, whatever that is. Women get attracted to whoever they want, which includes criminals and abusers. You can be the best version of yourself and it still doesn't guarantee you will get laid. Life simply doesn't work like that.

Life is unfair. Always think about what's best for yourself. So go out there, spend that dough and get laid guilt free and don't let any moral police get to you.",sayantaneden10,229,342,0.7200000286102295,0.1329689833726649,1734466768,/r/changemyview/comments/1hgjslt/cmv_there_is_nothing_wrong_in_seeking_escorts_if/,2024,12,changemyview,2024-12-17 20:19:28
1hbc4s8,"CMV: Folks who refuse to tip on ""principle"" are just throwing a tantrum aimed at the wrong group.","I understand folks refusing to tip at places like Starbucks or McDonalds where the employee is not a tipped wage earner, but I hate folks when refuse to tip even at restaurants or for delivery where it is actually expected. The system sucks, but stiffing the worker who provided you a service is just taking your frustrations out on the exploited party. If you really want to send a message, don't use those delivery platforms or frequent those restaurants that rely on tipped wage earners and vote with your dollars.

Folks act like tipping is just peer pressure from the worker when in actuality tips exist to bridge the gap between the tipped wage and minimum wage. Obviously none of us made that decision, but it is the way that the system is currently constructed. Folks who refuse to tip tipped wage earners are just throwing a tantrum over this lack of control. There are actual constructive actions you can take to change the status quo, call your representative, organize with workers rights advocates, boycott restaurant owners, but stiffing the employee just puts that person in danger of wage theft for no fault of their own, especially if they are an immigrant or lack the time/resources to pursue legal action.

For the folks saying that tipping has gotten out of control and they don't want to tip every time they make a purchase are right, so don't. Oh you feel pressured because the check out person flipped the screen around for you? Grow a backbone, hit skip, and turn it back. You are not obligated to tip everyone, but there are certain people you are obligated to tip if you receive a service from them and you should absent some extenuating circumstances.

And yes, tipping is a way for restaurants to pass costs off to the consumer. But do you really think the price of the food on the menu would remain the same if the worker received the actual minimum wage. The price you pay for food is lower because restaurants don't have to account as much for employee wage when crafting the menu. If they did, the price would increase and these same folks complaining about tipping culture would start complaining about unaffordability. Paying for services is not cheap, paying for a persons time and efforts is not cheap. It sucks that certain activities may not be cost effective for everyone, but that is the nature of discretionary spending. You can either play by the rules and try to change them if you are so inclined, or stay home and cook for yourself.

1i22ljg,CMV: People flocking to Rednote proves the Governments argument about the TikTok ban,"Most people believe the reason the Federal Government banned TikTok was because of data collection, which is for sure part of it, but that's not the main reason it was banned. It was banned because of concerns that a foreign owned social media app, particularly one influenced directly by a foreign Government can manipulate US citizens into behaving in a way that benefits them.

No one knew what Rednote was 2 weeks ago in the US. All it took was a few well placed posts encouraging people to flock to a highly monitored highly censored app directly controlled by the CCP and suddenly an unknown app in the United States rocketed to the number 1 app in the country. 

This is an app that frequently removes content mentioning LGBTQ rights, anything they view as immodest, and any discussion critizing the CCP- a party actively engaging in Genocide against the Uyghurs. Yet you have a flood of young people who just months ago decried the US's response to the Gazan crisis flocking to an app controlled by a government openly and unapologetically engaging in Genocide. 

This was not an organic movement. If one is upset at the hamstringing of free speech their first reaction would not be to rush to an app that is controlled by a government that has some of the worst rankings of free speech globally.

1i1qdgi,CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home ,"I think that Muslims who have immigrated to European nations and are now demanding Sharia Law (or the choice to be tried under Sharia) in that country should go back to their home countries. I’m a left leaning person and respect everyone’s religion and beliefs, but I don’t think they should be forced on others or the people who practice said religions should be harassing people who don’t follow the same. There have been protests lately in Germany where Muslims are demanding Sharia law, and polls show that a large number of middle eastern Muslim immigrants living in France, England, Denmark etc support bringing Sharia Law to those countries. I don’t believe that Sharia goes well whatsoever with western values, and I don’t think they should even have the option to be tried under sharia in these countries either. Sharia law includes things like: 

- Killing someone who decides to leave the Muslim faith 
- Not much freedom for Women 
- Sex before marriage is punishable by death 
- Homosexuality punishable by death
- Women unable to travel for more than a couple of days without a male guardian 
- Death Penalty/ Extreme over the top punishment for thieves 
- Grown men being able to marry young girls 

These things don’t align whatsoever with most western values.

If middle eastern immigrants in Europe (or anywhere else for that matter but mainly focusing on Europe rn) that are demanding Sharia Law should go back to their home countries or to a country that has Sharia if it’s that big of a deal to them. I just don’t see why they’re in a western country if they don’t agree with western values.

1i7wbcj,"cmv: Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman are dangerous and do not deserve to have the platform they have. They are naive, fragile and inauthentic leaders of a cult.","Background: I once was an avid listener of ‘the rogansphere’ podcasts such as Joe Rogan, Lex Fridman and their friends. I stopped after realising that they are no longer some apolitical piece of individual media but something entirely else.
I have changed my mind to now be very anti-Rogan and I am amongst many male peers who are still in it or entering it. It was a phase for me and I hope it is for them too. 

My view: 
Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman are the kind of people who really like to appear as indifferent and open-minded but they have a really specific agenda. It seems as though their ideas of merit all come from martial arts, physical fitness, counter-academia, comedy and your willingness to partake in popular conspiracies. 

We all know Joe Rogan is not academic or by any means a genius, and he would even agree. But the fact that he uses his platform to encourage and broadcast ideas that he likes without any proper debating or counterpoints means that he is, intentionally or not, propagating an agenda. I’m afraid the usual argument of ‘it’s his podcast he can have whoever he wants on’ is just not acceptable now. His platform is too big and he should take responsibility for the ideas he is spreading.

Lex Fridman is a total worm. His monologues and soliloquies, I once saw as charming, are so naive, cringe and insufferable. A total narcissist who needs people to love him and view him as some innocent soul who only wants peace and love. He’s always like ‘I am trying my best’. Well do better, you have a massive platform and if you really want to be indifferent than be authentically indifferent rather than riding the coat tails of Rogan and Musk. He is just echoing the same agenda as the rest of the Rogansphere. The fact that in his podcast with President Zelenskyy, he has the nerve to question a world leader’s willingness to negotiate a peace deal with Russia in such a naive and holier-than-thou way just goes to show how these idiots aren’t equipped to ask proper questions and be reliable talk pieces for us to listen to. 

They also have massively contributed to division within the culture wars, much more so than what they claim ‘wokeness’ has.
They are becoming talk pieces for the far-right and seriously doing a lot more damage to the world than they are claiming. 

Please tell me how these guys are useful, why they deserve their platform and how they aren’t a total cult.

1ibmxfc,CMV: It's entirely reasonable and not hypocritical to doubt the results of the 2024 election,"To be clear, I'm not saying Trump cheated to win the 2024 election. I don't know that and I don't think we ever will know that for certain. And due to the post-election security gaps that is true for every election- though I see no reason to doubt other elections. 

But when a notorious cheater facing prison who was despised by many, who threw a tantrum when he lost the popular vote last time, not only wins an election but wins the popular vote in every single swing state... I think it's reasonable to have some doubts. Especially when it happens after false bomb threats from a foreign power are called into polling places, forcing everybody there to evacuate. 

What's done is done, but given the circumstances I think  more questions should have been raised after the votes were counted and I think it's entirely reasonable and not hypocritical to doubt the results. I'm not saying Trump should be removed from power- I think he's a terrible president and person, but barring concrete evidence of election interference, as far as anybody knows, he was elected fair and square. But at least for me, this election will always have a question mark above it. But I welcome other views on this subject. Change my view.

1hxh0ka,"CMV: If Trump attacked Greenland and Denmark tried to defend it, his government wouldn't survive it","Currently, Denmark is close to perfect US ally...

* They have been NATO Allies for 75 years
* They spend >2 percent of GDP on defence
* They mostly buy American equipment and try
* When US trigerred Article 5, Denmark answered and their troops didn't shy away from combat in most violent parts of Afghanistan and Iraq. They actually had very similar per capita losses to the US in Afghanistan and highest of the non-US countries
* They gave very significant amounts of material to Ukraine, including F-16 fighter jets
* They allow US to have bases on their territory in Greenland and do whatever US wants there
* They have overwhelmingly favourable view of the US and support most of its foreign policy

If Trump decided to attack territory of such a nation, most of the US public would certainly see it as an incredible betrayal and he would have trouble keeping power. If Denmark decided to try to defend Greenland and internet would get flooded with imagery of US forces destroying Danish troops, who are merely defending their border, I don't believe that even the hardline Republican party members would be able to stomach it.

1hvu7na,CMV: Western countries are the least racist countries in the world,"So unlike what much of Reddit may want you to believe Western countries by and large are actually amongst the least racist countries on earth. So when we actually look at studies and polls with regards to racism around the world we actually see that the [least racist countries](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/least-racist-countries) are actually all Western countries, while the [most racist countries](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/most-racist-countries) are largely non-Western countries.

In some of the largest non-Western countries like China or India for example racism is way more prevalant than it is in the West. In China for example they openly show ads like[ this one ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36394917)on TV and in cinemas, where a Chinese woman puts a black man into a laundry machine and out comes a ""clean"" fair-skinned Chinese man. 

And in India colorism still seems to be extremely prevelant and common place, with more dark-skinned Indians often being systemtically discriminated against and looked down upon, while more light-skinned Indians are typically favored in Indian society.

And Arab countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar or United Arab Emirates according to polls are among the most racist countries on earth, with many ethnic minorities and migrant workers being systemtically discrimianted against and basically being subjected to what are forms of slave labor. Meanwhile the least racist countries accroding to polls are all Western countries like New Zealand, Canada or the Netherlands.

Now, I am not saying that the West has completely eliminated racism and that racism has entirely disappeared from Western society. Surely racism still exists in Western countries to some extent. And sure the West used to be incredibly racist too only like 50 or 60 years ago. But the thing is the West in the last few decades by and large has actually made enormous progress with regards to many social issues, including racism. And today Western countries are actually by and large the least racist countries in the world.

1i86unn,"CMV: I’m Afraid This Administration Will Make Life Substantially Worse for Black Americans, and I Don’t Know If There’s a Line They Won’t Cross","I’m scared, and I’m looking for reassurance. As a Black person, I’ve already concluded that Trump and Elon Musk are racist, based on their actions and statements. What I’m struggling with is this fear that life under this administration will get substantially worse for people like me—and that their supporters won’t ever draw a line, no matter how bad things get.

Here are some things that have already happened or seem to be in the works:
	
Ending Equal Opportunity Programs: Trump revoked policies aimed at promoting racial equity in hiring and government programs.

Stop-and-Frisk: He signed an executive order encouraging its return, which disproportionately impacts Black and brown communities.
	
Wildfire Risks: Water is being rerouted from Northern California, a region that hasn’t had major wildfires in years, to Central California. This feels like it’s putting lives at risk unnecessarily.
	
Elon Musk’s Nazi Affiliation: Musk has amplified neo-Nazi accounts on Twitter, seemingly supported Germany’s far-right party, and even made what looks like a Nazi salute at a public event.

I’m terrified of what this could escalate to. Discrimination in hiring might push more Black people into desperate situations like selling drugs or stealing to survive. With policies like stop-and-frisk, that could mean more of us ending up incarcerated. My biggest fear is that there’s no “step too far” for their supporters. Would things like migrant camps or even more explicit authoritarian measures finally make people realize this is heading into Nazi territory? Or will they just keep defending every action?

I’m not asking for someone to convince me these people aren’t racist—I’m already past that. I just want to believe that there’s a line they can’t cross, that legal systems, public resistance, or something will stop things from spiraling further.

Can anyone reassure me that there’s hope? Or convince me that this won’t make my life—and the lives of Black Americans—substantially worse?",Scary-Ad-1345,495,1865,0.6000000238418579,0.3516053461125085,1737648586,/r/changemyview/comments/1i86unn/cmv_im_afraid_this_administration_will_make_life/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-23 16:09:46
1i9u2h8,cmv: Trump was not a reasonable choice for president.,"Let me get this straight. I am German, and while I do have some horses in this race considering the US is such a large country that it effects me too, I am not nearly as effected as actual Americans. 

I am also left. I am not super politically active, but I know enough about Trump to dislike him. Aside from his treatment of minority groups such as LGBTQ people and his ignorance of climate change, I also dislike his economic tatiff plans for the US and how they seem to mostly help the 1%. Project 2025 is also a whole different can of worms. And I also heard something about him raising the prices for medicine already. And his relationship to Elon who supports the AFD, did two nazi gestures and censors Twitter is.. well. You know it.

Once again, I am not super into politics but the fact that Trump actually got elected surprised me. In hindsight I shouldnt of been, but I thought ""someone like THAT won't be voted AGAIN, they can't be this dumb. He dodged a question about border security with aliens eating cats and dogs."" 

But here we are.

But I want to try and be unbiased. I dont even want you to prove to me that he was a better choice, just a reasonable one. Make me say ""Well I disagree but I can see why one might think like that.""

1hsaw8u,CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries,"Based on my personal experience, what I've been hearing from my relatives, friends and co-workers, and also what I've read online on various forums, blogs, social media posts, I strongly believe that non-white countries are a lot more ignorant toward ""minorities"" or people who are considered non-white. In modern days most white countries would gladly accept immigrants and politically and socially they have dedicated laws and resources that are meant to help immigrants. Since the majority of white countries have a history of colonizing the world, modern history and social culture focus a lot on the sentiment of accepting people who are different than you, or simply the idea of racial/ethnic diversity and inclusion when it comes to representation and treatment. The school system or general education emphasizes on that, and all the organizations and firms would also follow and do the same(even if they have ulterior motive/not being genuine). As long as you grow up in a modern environment, you will learn about racism and that miniorities are perceived as ""vulnerable"" and there is this idea of treating people with respect no matter their cultural background, skin color, language etc.

Most white countries are diverse and have a lot of non-white citizens and migrants who yet to obtain their documents. In contrast, non-white countries are less immigrant-friendly and hence the society generally is not very aware of the aforementioned ideology/concept related to diversity, inclusion, racism etc. 

In Japan for example, there are restaurants can out right say no to people who look foreign(especially those with darker skintones) to them and use the ""no foreigner"" excuse to deny non-Japanese customers in the disguise of xenophobia. Such excuse would not be acceptable in western society. If a restaurant owner from UK, France, U.S, Canada denies someone who is foreign from entering their restaurant just because they are a foreigner or in the worst case that they believe they look foreign by their ethnicity, they will get sued and exposed on social media, and by laws and societal standards they will lose their license to operate. 

A Taiwanese friend of mine also told me that he has experienced way more casual/systematic racism in Congo than in other european countries he has lived in(he travels around because he works as an intepreter for a logistic company). From being stopped by police and asked to pay dirty money since he looks asian, to being denied rental housing even though his paperwork was perfect to Congolese casually pulling their eyes and mimick chinese person speaking, the incident amount is absurd as opposed to what he experienced in Canada, U.S and New Zealand. Such contrast of racist incidents are also reported a lot by my other friends who are from different ethnicities and a particular Pakistani friend who has very dark skin of mine said he was denied multiple jobs when he was working in UAE because his employers outright prefer to hire white caucasian, arab or even east asian workers because ""it makes the company looks more professional"". There are no specific laws that will define prejudice/racism in many context in these countries and even if they are, many can get away with it and the society as whole does not put enough emphasis to fight agianst racial/ethnic discirmination like what the western society does.

In conclusion, I believe non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries, and its not just limited to casual, day to day personal racism but also systematic racism. (See how China can outright limits the freedom of any ethnic minorities or lock away foreigners as the authority deems so, or that African countries can infringe the rights of white/non-black citizens or that the fact non-white countries do not have enough immigrant politicians in the government because people do not vote for them and they gain no power and favorism even in elections etc).",padorUWU,1880,810,0.800000011920929,0.3440448175739422,1735868750,/r/changemyview/comments/1hsaw8u/cmv_nonwhite_countries_are_a_lot_more_racist_than/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-03 01:45:50
1i88qtx,"CMV: Despite being more knowledgeable, wealthier and apparently more tolerant, the political and individual left's biggest flaw is their inability to communicate pragmatically and empathetically with those who don't agree with them.","I've seen this rather confounding phenomenon that despite being ""smarter"" ""wealthier"" ""more tolerant"" and all the general buzz words you hear from the entire left, ranging from mainstream dems to far left people, their inability to humble themselves to actually *help* the other side is the biggest reason they can't succeed. 

Yes, let's rule out the hardest core right wing. But there are too many instances of a hyperventalive, astonished left that absolutely diminishes the pragmatic points they try to make. 

The general example i'm going to reference is the AOCs versus the Bernies. The breathy left versus the ""I have to find solutions"" left. 

I don't understand how anyone with more knowledge than someone cannot communicate with someone who has less knowledge than them. How if *you* know the answer, you can't communicate it with someone patiently enough to come up with common ground.

The problem is the gap in communication. We all get that there are no compromise righties that won't believe a word of what you're saying, but the inability to create mutual understanding is on you. If you can't communicate, then I'm sorry but I don't feel bad for you. There is obviously a lack of respect, and yes, I will forgive some of the interfamily dynamics that can get anyone on edge, but the overall loss of the left is due to their inability to humble themselves to create paradigms that people who oppose them can understand. It is to be on the same page (whether you agree or disagree) that is something worth fighting for, not to simply be astounded that someone thinks ""illegal immigrants are ruining the country,"" ""climate change isn't real"" ""x, y or z."" The *way* you communicate *facts* is what is harming you. 

Trust me when I say that if you are in position of control (are smarter), you should be able to reason with someone you disagree with. Ask any parent if they understand what their kid is saying, yet they can still reason with them and create dialogue. I truly do not believe that someone who is supposed to be smarter, cant find reason. And yes, the reason in this dialogue isnt ""you now agree with me,"" it's the patience to understand that you got them to think that you may be right. 

My true advice to anyone is to work on your communication and reasoning skills then stomping on someone. Learn the advantage of progress versus winning. Achieve common ground with someone you disagree with. 

My advice to your response isn't to simply blame the right. I've given the examples where you can blame them (furthest right, eg., bad actors; family). Let's make the goal to create respect than winning. And we all know that the right has its problems, but just remember, this thread is about you, the left.",poopchow,1013,1398,0.7099999785423279,0.3373329031122072,1737653281,/r/changemyview/comments/1i88qtx/cmv_despite_being_more_knowledgeable_wealthier/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-23 17:28:01

1i59te1,CMV: Conservatives Will Dominate America for the Next ~20 Years,"Note: By “conservatives,” I mean both Republicans and conservative Democrats.

Trump’s win in November was resounding in every way except the final popular vote tally. Trump won every swing state, and every state moved to the right. Trump fell short of a true majority of the popular vote and only won it by 1.5 points, but it was still the first time a Republican won the popular vote since 2004. Additionally, Republicans won over millions of voters from majority-Democratic voting blocs.

Many left-leaning people have claimed, falsely, that Democrats lost due to low turnout. In truth, the 2024 election saw the second- highest turnout of any presidential election, and swing states like Georgia and North Carolina saw record turnout. By all metrics, the Harris-Walz team’s attempts to “get out the vote” worked. They successfully got out the vote… for Trump. Indeed, Trump won both Independents and first-time voters. Trump won *because* of high turnout. High turnout no longer benefits Democrats.

All post-election polling has suggested that Republicans are now the more popular party. Overall, America shifted to the right by four points in 2024. One poll found that 43 percent of voters viewed Democrats favorably and 50 percent viewed them unfavorably. Increasingly, Democrats are viewed as affluent, out-of-touch, college-educated elites who ask for votes and never return the favor. Most voters trust Republicans more on the economy, immigration, and crime. The economy and immigration were the two most important issues for voters last year. Most voters support mass deportations, which Trump has repeatedly promised to begin on day one. It’s obvious that MAGA has won over the majority of voters, which is also why Democrats are starting to move towards the center on issues, immigration chief among them.

The shifts among key demographics are even more alarming. Harris barely won a majority of the Latino vote, and most Latino men voted for Trump. Harris won Asians nationally, but Asians in Nevada shifted to the right by more than *50 points*. Democrats may have permanently lost the Muslim vote because Muslims hate ~~Jews~~ ~~Israel~~ “genocide,” and the recent ceasefire deal, in which Trump was apparently instrumental, might be the final nail in the coffin, especially considering Muslims’ social views make white evangelicals seem progressive. That could mean that Democrats will never again win Michigan. Other racial and religious groups, such as blacks and Jews, also shifted to the right by smaller amounts.

However, the most alarming shift is among young voters. According to the AP VoteCast, Harris only won young voters by 4 points; Biden carried them by more than 30. Young men especially are rapidly shifting towards the GOP. The reasons for this shift are debated, though many attribute it to perceived abandonment and/or demonization of men by the left. Also worth noting are the issues that are genuinely worse for men, such as the male suicide rate. For instance, the percentage of college students who are female now is roughly equal to the percentage of college students who were male prior to Title IX, and college enrollment among men is declining. More and more men are opting for trade schools instead, largely due to costs. This is important because college-educated people tend to be more liberal (the so-called “diploma divide”), while tradespeople tend to be very conservative. Lastly, since young voters’ views tend to be the most malleable, it stands to reason that more and more young voters will embrace MAGA.

This shift to the right is not limited to the US. In fact, the West as a whole is moving sharply to the right, largely for the same reasons as the US: the economy and immigration. The Conservatives are all but guaranteed to take control of Canada later this year and were even before Trudeau’s resignation. Although Labour took control of Parliament just last year, its popularity has already plummeted, and Reform UK’s popularity has surged. The SPD is poised to get voted out this year, and the AfD is becoming more popular by the minute. Now, the situation in Europe is different - and frankly, more dire - than the situation here in the States. Europe is currently facing widespread economic stagnation, and European society is being upended by immigration, particularly from the Islamic world. Similarly, largely unrestricted immigration in Canada has inflated home prices and created numerous social issues. As a result, left-wing parties haven’t been less popular since the Cold War, and right-wing populist parties who claim to have solutions are rapidly gaining popularity. Arguably, Trump’s comeback was the final nail in the coffin for the progressivism of the early century. At the time of writing, all signs point to a generation of right-wing dominance of America and the West as a whole.",Emperor_Kyrius,697,1225,0.7099999785423279,0.2736806003299007,1737322633,/r/changemyview/comments/1i59te1/cmv_conservatives_will_dominate_america_for_the/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-19 21:37:13

1icdp5l,CMV: Billionaires shouldn’t exist,"The existence of billionaires is proof of a rigged system that mistakes greed for “innovation” and exploitation for “merit.” It is not a sign of a thriving economy.

No one earns a billion dollars. You *extract* it by underpaying workers, dodging taxes, privatizing public goods,  commodifying basic human needs, etc.

The math doesn't lie. Even spending $1 million a day, it would take almost 3,000 years to go through a billion dollars. The top 1% of Americans hoard $44 trillion in wealth which is more than the bottom 90% combined. Meanwhile ending global poverty would cost roughly $300 billion *annually*. Jeff Bezos could single-handedly fund that for 50 years and still die richer than Croesus. This isn’t capitalism. It’s just feudalism with better PR.  

“But they create jobs!”

No, workers create value and billionaires just skim it. Elon Musk’s wealth surged by $150 billion during the pandemic while his factory employees fought for bathroom breaks and unions. The Walton family’s fortune for example was built on welfare-subsidized Walmart wages so low, taxpayers foot the bill for their employees’ food stamps.  

And philanthropy is a scam. Gates and Zuckerberg don’t “donate” wealth. They stash it in tax-free foundations to lobby governments, dodge accountability, and shape policy in their image. I’m no other toke has this been more true then now with Trump. 

Want to end malaria? Pay. Your. Taxes. Let democratically elected leaders, not unelected oligarchs, decide how to fix society.  

Oh and these 2,600 billionaires on Earth emit a million times more carbon than the average person. Private jets, mega-yachts, and Mars escapism aren’t “rewards for hard work” 😂 

They’re crimes against humanity’s survival.  

“They took risks”

So do teachers, nurses, and firefighters. They just don’t get to offshore their salaries to the Cayman Islands. Billionaires aren’t “self-made.” They’re products of publicly funded infrastructure, education, and research. 

Steve Jobs didn’t invent the iPhone. He exploited taxpayer-funded tech like GPS and the internet.  

Defend billionaires as anything other than glitches in a broken system. Argue that hoarding wealth equal to 10,000 lifetimes of labor is ethical while 1 in 9 people starve.

However, more than 50% of voters in the US voted for a felon who had a 'concept of a plan' about healthcare rather than [Kamala's policies](https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/04/kamala-harris-election-win-could-bring-health-care-policy-changes/) which would be a move in the direction of Germany's public healthcare system.

1i9hqhz,CMV: Democrats need to realize that listing off the unhinged things the Donald Trump says/does won’t get them anywhere as it’s ACTUALLY what his supporters like about him.,"Trump’s supporters watch news about him more closely than anyone else—including factual and true news. They know and even believe many of the wild things he’s said and done, but don’t care. In fact, that’s a feature of him that they prefer. Calling politicians by names and going “off the cuff” is exactly what they are seeking because it’s how they themselves feel.

So when Democrats or Democratic politicians chastise him for being immoral or corrupt, it doesn’t help their cause at all. The information is already out there and his supporters have already absorbed it. It’s nothing new or alarming for them.

All of this outrage about Trump is a waste of time and effort. Instead, Democrats should focus on trying to understand what his supporters really feel and want in order to win them over.",DropKicck,1141,462,0.8899999856948853,0.204128132480988,1737789827,/r/changemyview/comments/1i9hqhz/cmv_democrats_need_to_realize_that_listing_off/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-25 07:23:47
1hz13nc,CMV: Obama laughing with trump is not something to be concerned about,"I’m not too desperate to get into most political talk, but people being concerned with Obama laughing at a joke by trump has been quite the stir recently. Ive seen posts on a few subreddits making the claim that the issue is not left or right, but classism, while using the photo of trump and Obama laughing at jimmy carters funeral. 

I’ve wanted to make the counter argument that the photo can be seen as a positive for Obama. I feel as though he has the capability to sit with anyone and perceive them as human. The ability to sit down and chat with your opposition is a positive trait that Obama uses as both leverage and assurity of level headedness from himself. 

I’m not going to deny the statement that class issues are a huge problem. Class inequality is what I believe to be one of our bigger issues in the United States and needs to be addressed. However, I do believe that Obama is not in the wrong for the ability to laugh at a joke by their opposition party, nor does it conclude that he is a problem with such an issue. In fact, I think that is something that Trump had begun to remove from the political scene compared to all other elections before his first run in 2016. You can compare political debates before the 2016 election and find more level headedness while still disagreeing. 

I also apologize if some of this is a bit unclear, feel free to have me rewrite some statements. I’ve just woken up and a bit hungover, idk why I have the energy to discuss this but I’m down for it lol

1i852w8,"CMV: the term “Nazi” is an entirely appropriate approximate description of Trumpist Republicans based on a contemporaneous understanding of Nazi ideology, rather than a retrospective one.","Nazi isn't a generic slur. Neither does it require perfect specificity. Fascism itself is a collection of broad ideological goals, political tendencies, tactics, and aesthetics.

The idea of the Nazi as a cartoonishly evil villain stems from our retrospective understanding of what Nazism ultimately achieved. But for the average German citizen in the late 1920s-early 1930s, Nazism would have looked remarkably similar to Trumpism. The major exceptions are the nationalization of corporations and the explicit naming of Jews in the platform. The fact that today's GOP is smart enough to build on the Atwater/Nixon/Reagan Southern Strategy and not specifically call out racial and ethnic groups is a matter of tactics and degrees -- not a meaningful difference in ideology. In addition, you don't need to nationalize industry when you have a corporate oligarchy -- you can preserve the mythologies of capitalism while enjoying the benefits of corporate socialism. 

While some people may have reasonable concerns about the (over)use of the term ""Nazi"" to describe the American right today, many people who are pushing back against this language simply want cover to flirt with ideas and policies German Nazis would have loved. To advance the ideas without the label so those ideas appear respectable -- so they can rail against immigrants and trans people, remain in polite society and make extremism more acceptable. The rest are just pedants.

Here is the pre-war Nazi party platform:

1. We demand the union of all Germans in a Greater Germany on the basis of the right of national self-determination.
2. We demand equality of rights for the German people in its dealings with other nations, and the revocation of the peace treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain.
3. We demand land and territory (colonies) to feed our people and to settle our surplus population.
4. Only members of the nation may be citizens of the State. Only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation.
5. Non-citizens may live in Germany only as guests and must be subject to laws for aliens.
6. The right to vote on the State’s government and legislation shall be enjoyed by the citizens of the State alone. We demand therefore that all official appointments, of whatever kind, whether in the Reich, in the states or in the smaller localities, shall be held by none but citizens.
We oppose the corrupting parliamentary custom of filling posts merely in accordance with party considerations, and without reference to character or abilities.
7. We demand that the State shall make it its primary duty to provide a livelihood for its citizens. If it should prove impossible to feed the entire population, foreign nationals (non-citizens) must be deported from the Reich.
8. All non-German immigration must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who entered Germany after 2 August 1914 shall be required to leave the Reich forthwith.
9. All citizens shall have equal rights and duties.
10. It must be the first duty of every citizen to perform physical or mental work. The activities of the individual must not clash with the general interest, but must proceed within the framework of the community and be for the general good.
We demand therefore:
11. The abolition of incomes unearned by work.
The breaking of the slavery of interest
12. In view of the enormous sacrifices of life and property demanded of a nation by any war, personal enrichment from war must be regarded as a crime against the nation. We demand therefore the ruthless confiscation of all war profits.
13. We demand the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations (trusts).
14. We demand profit-sharing in large industrial enterprises.
15. We demand the extensive development of insurance for old age.
16. We demand the creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class, the immediate communalizing of big department stores, and their lease at a cheap rate to small traders, and that the utmost consideration shall be shown to all small traders in the placing of State and municipal orders.
17. We demand a land reform suitable to our national requirements, the passing of a law for the expropriation of land for communal purposes without compensation; the abolition of ground rent, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.
18. We demand the ruthless prosecution of those whose activities are injurious to the common interest. Common criminals, usurers, profiteers, etc., must be punished with death, whatever their creed or race.
19. We demand that Roman Law, which serves a materialistic world order, be replaced by a German common law.
20. The State must consider a thorough reconstruction of our national system of education (with the aim of opening up to every able and hard-working German the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement). The curricula of all educational establishments must be brought into line with the requirements of practical life. The aim of the school must be to give the pupil, beginning with the first sign of intelligence, a grasp of the notion of the State (through the study of civic affairs). We demand the education of gifted children of poor parents, whatever their class or occupation, at the expense of the State.
21. The State must ensure that the nation’s health standards are raised by protecting mothers and infants, by prohibiting child labor, by promoting physical strength through legislation providing for compulsory gymnastics and sports, and by the extensive support of clubs engaged in the physical training of youth.
22. We demand the abolition of the mercenary [i.e. professional] army and the formation of a people’s army.
23. We demand legal warfare on deliberate political mendacity and its dissemination in the press. To facilitate the creation of a German national press we demand:
(a) that all editors of, and contributors to newspapers appearing in the German language must be members of the nation;
(b) that no non-German newspapers may appear without the express permission of the State. They must not be printed in the German language;
(c) that non-Germans shall be prohibited by law from participating financially in or influencing German newspapers, and that the penalty for contravening such a law shall be the suppression of any such newspaper, and the immediate deportation of the non-Germans involved.
The publishing of papers which are not conducive to the national welfare must be forbidden. We demand the legal prosecution of all those tendencies in art and literature which corrupt our national life, and the suppression of cultural events which violate this demand.
24. We demand freedom for all religious denominations in the State, provided they do not threaten its existence nor offend the moral feelings of the German race.
The Party, as such, stands for positive Christianity, but does not commit itself to any particular denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialist spirit within and without us, and is convinced that our nation can achieve permanent health only from within on the basis of the principle: The common interest before self-interest.
25. To put the whole of this program into effect, we demand the creation of a strong central state power for the Reich; the unconditional authority of the political central Parliament over the entire Reich and its organizations; and the formation of Corporations based on estate and occupation for the purpose of carrying out the general legislation passed by the Reich in the various German states.
The leaders of the Party promise to work ruthlessly—if need be to sacrifice their very lives—to translate this program into action.

1hwv4lp,CMV: Disney should make new movies with minority leads instead of race swapping in remakes ,"Literally the title. I’m a huge Disney fan but this is so lazy. I feel like if they actually cared about inclusion and representing minorities, they’d make original stories that represent them, not the half assed remakes that they’re using for cash grabs. I’m not one of those “why is Disney woke now 😡” kind of people, I’m happy to see more representation but I just hate how they’re doing it. Race swapping white characters like Ariel the mermaid and Hercules in live action remakes is just a dead giveaway that they’d rather take the easy way out instead of actually taking time to make fresh stuff. 

I feel like Disney was more inclusive back when they didn’t try so hard. Stuff like Pocahontas, Mulan, Lilo & Stitch and Princess and the frog. It felt real. Now it just feels so forced that many are unable to appreciate it. 

With only making remakes with minority leads instead of taking time to make them their own original princess/ main character I feel like they’re basically saying “you’re not worth the time of a new project”. Why can’t they just continue with things like Encanto, Moana, and Wish? Have they ran out of ideas or something?

1i5akbz,"CMV: When you are very naive, you believe the USA is the greatest country in the world. When you start to learn more, you believe it is a mess, almost a 3rd world country. When you are truly educated, you realize it is amazing compared to most of the world, and probably in the top 10 to live in.","this is at least what I gathered from fellow argentinians opinions on the US. The reality is that it has lots of very large problems to tackle, but in comparisson to the rest of the world, in terms of standard of living, it is one of the best countries in the world. for women, for LGBT people, for working people in general.

countries that may be even better are probably in the single digits, or low double digits: norway and switzerland probably, then maybe denmark and finland. much more difficult to determine are countries such as germany which is probably about the same, sweden which is in my opinion slightly worse than the US, maybe taiwan, australia.

the fact is, the US is very rich. it has ridiculous amount of disposable income, and while it is economically unequal, still most people have more purchasing power than in other developed countries. it is very good for doing business, inversting, it is very good compared to the world in LGBT laws and people's opinion on LGBT issues. it is one of the least racists countries in the world, if you travelled a lot you would know about it.

in my 18-20s I was very anti-USA, then I educated myself and put it in the top 10 best countries to live in. which is specially commendable giving its very large land area and population to manage. the single worst issue compared to other developed countries is security: homicides and its GPI is very much worse than other comparable countries. then in democracy, GINI, health it could be better. but in median income, GDP PPP, GDP PPP per capita, poverty rates, unemployment rates, HDI,  business, competitive, innovation indexes, economic freedom, etc. is a beast.

It would be a pleasure for most people in the world to live in the US. I travelled to the US, and was able to see, apart from just reading and educating myself about it. it is spectacular. infrastructure, cleanliness, the level of houses in suburbia and city centre. 

whats more, in economic and population (fertility & immigration) fronts, it has a very bright future. europe and developed asia face much more challenges, though this is a little bit more subjective.

BACK to the title: due to being the only superpower of the world, its bast cultural and propagandistic influences in the world makes it so that when you are naive, you think its amazing. then you start to learn about opioid crisis, health insurance crisis, uber-conservatives, etc so you think its a developing nation. after that, you get the gift of nuance and start to see that, comperatively, it is truly an amazing country to live in.

to change my view, you need to

1. establish the US as a probably non top 10 country to live in

2. convince me that most naive people in the world 'worship' the US, then when they learn some stuff they hate it, and then people who are very passionate about global politics, economics, int. relations, that read & watch much about comparable standards of living from country to country with nuance and an open mind, love the US or at least respect it a lot.",cuervodeboedo1,809,586,0.7300000190734863,0.1855714323486964,1737324508,/r/changemyview/comments/1i5akbz/cmv_when_you_are_very_naive_you_believe_the_usa/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-19 22:08:28

1hwzoat,"CMV: Trump is not fit to be the face of America, let alone the president.","This post is really just relevant to American users, but I'd like to hear the opinions of anybody outside the country if they do have a say. I, personally, do not understand how people can openly support Trump with the vast amount of information out there that definitely does not paint him as a good person. I've seen most supporters say that they voted for him hoping for cheaper gas prices, groceries, and to ""Make America Great Again."" I believe the country has never truly been great and needs much work, but that is an entirely different conversation.  
 Even if I did believe Trump could and would do everything his supporters are hoping for, I would not vote for him. Why? He was openly a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein for, according to Epstein himself, 10 whole years. There are clips of the two of them talking about women's looks - which I doubt their conversations were respectful after the ""grab 'em by the pussy"" comment. Trump says these exact words about Epstein: ""I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy... It is even said that he likes women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."" I'm not saying that Trump was a part of Epstein's crimes, but I would not be surprised if such news were to ever be revealed. I am simply pointing out who he has been associated with - for example, Matt Gaetz, who was said to have paid a 17-year-old girl for sex. Trump has faced similar allegations of sexual assault since 1970- 26 different allegations, to be exact. He has denied all of them, but considering the people he is around and the things he has said, it is very hard to believe him. As just about everyone knows, he IS a convicted felon.  
 America might need the cheaper gas prices, we might need the cheaper groceries, the walls, the need to be great, but is it truly worth putting the state of the country into the hands of a felon? The hands of a man that has likely touched and hurt women without a care in the world? Hands that shook with Jeffrey Epstein? No. I would truly love to know how anybody could ever choose that just for a cheaper life. ",Silent_Ice6040,482,739,0.6800000071525574,0.1721721193465559,1736382170,/r/changemyview/comments/1hwzoat/cmv_trump_is_not_fit_to_be_the_face_of_america/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-09 00:22:50
1ie2m3n,"CMV: Until Melania and Baron Trump are deported, nobody else in the US should be ripped from their homes.","CMV: Nobody in the U.S. should be deported until Melania and Barron Trump are deported, because by Donald Trump's own definition, they are not legal citizens and should be the first to go—along with Elon Musk.

Premise 1: Trump’s Own Immigration Standards  
Donald Trump has consistently advocated for stricter immigration policies, including ending birthright citizenship, revoking visas for those who ""take American jobs,"" and heavily scrutinizing chain migration—the very system through which Melania Trump obtained citizenship. Under his own logic, Melania’s citizenship, obtained via the EB-1 visa (intended for people with ""extraordinary ability""), should be considered invalid, as her qualifications were dubious. If chain migration is unacceptable, then her parents, who became citizens through her, also should not be here. Barron Trump, as the child of an allegedly ineligible citizen, would also lack valid status under this framework.  

Premise 2: Consistency in Deportation Priorities
If the U.S. government enforces deportation policies, it should start with the most high-profile and politically connected individuals who benefited from questionable immigration practices. Trump’s own rhetoric suggests that immigrants take jobs, commit crimes, and exploit loopholes. Elon Musk, a billionaire immigrant, has been accused of labor violations and manipulating the visa system to benefit himself and his businesses. If deportation is about protecting American workers, Musk should be at the top of the list.  

Premise 3: Moral and Logical Fairness  
It is unjust to target vulnerable, low-income immigrants while allowing wealthy or politically powerful immigrants to remain. If Trump’s base truly believes in enforcing immigration laws without exception, they should demand the deportation of those who benefited from the very systems he condemns—starting with his own family. Until this happens, no one else should be deported, as doing so would be an inconsistent and hypocritical application of immigration law.  

Conclusion
If Trump’s immigration policies are to be applied fairly, Melania and Barron Trump, as well as Elon Musk, should be first in line for deportation. Until that happens, the U.S. should halt all other deportations to avoid selective enforcement that disproportionately harms the powerless while protecting the elite.

1i89lhx,CMV: Pardoning the insurrectionists will prove disastrous for the Republican Party,"I’m open to having my mind changed on this, but I personally fail to see how this plays out well for the GOP. 

I believe this move has short term effects that help Trump’s administration earn some brownie points with MAGA supporters but in the long term I think it might do more harm than good.

I feel like this move solidifies the GOP as a chaotic, anti-law-and-order party, whereas usually they aim to be seen as the opposite. It obviously alienates moderate and independent voters who were disgusted with the events of Jan 6 - as well as younger voters who, as I understand it, are especially critical of the Jan 6 attack on the capitol.

If that isn’t enough, this would solidify Trump’s ties to the Republican party indefinitely, essentially meaning any Republican candidate for the foreseeable future has to play along, embrace the pardon and I could see that playing out badly when they try to appeal to the general electorate when Trump inevitably cannot run again in 2028.

But it’s actually not his nature, he’s only scared of being laughed at. He’s not actually scared of immigrants or DEI hires or trans people himself.  He’s a rich well socialised guy who just basically wants to feel important and grab money.

He is using his tough guy image as a negotiating tactic to try and throw weight around, and it’s working as people are actually believing he’s crazy and destructive, and he will even do things until people complain.

He’s not sure how to actually do anything so he’s just saying a lot and listening to what latches on in people and what they say, just spitballing.

1i25vp1,"CMV: ""I disapprove of what you have to say, but I will fight for your right to say it"", is a good principle for society.","I am relative purist when I comes to free speech. Whilst I accept there are some limitations, I think I these are fringe cases (violence, libel).

I think broadly society should have a mutually understood principle that even if you disagree or disapprove of someone's speech, they have the right to say it.

This includes supposed 'misinformation' and 'hate speech'.

As John Stuart Mill makes clear in On Liberty ""he who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that"", and ""“If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.”

Hate speech is a poorly worded and fascial set of legislation in the UK that can be used to prosecute anyone (including a young girl posting lyrics to a rap song and many teaching his dog to nazi salute as a joke - both of which have been arrested and prosecuted, though the former was released on appeal).

1i31opi,"CMV: Changing the correct term from ""homeless"" to ""unhoused"" does nothing to break the social stigma and is arguably a worse term","I want to open a discussion on the terms ""homeless"" and ""unhoused"" as I have seen many different opinions on this. Personally, I think it's counterproductive to call out people for being offensive because they use the term homeless for a few different reasons.

1. From an etymology standpoint, these words mean almost the same exact thing. House and home are synonymous. -Less means to be without, and un- means the opposite of. So homeless means to be without a home, and unhoused means you are not housed.
2. I think ""unhoused"" excludes people who choose to live with no stationary home. To me, homeless better describes this because it just means to be without a permanent dwelling. Unhoused, to me, could imply that the norm is housed and you are not. I think it can also imply you have become unhoused due solely to outside factors. Homeless, in my opinion, does not determine any fault or factor. It is simply to be without a permanent home. This is why I think it could be worse to use ""unhoused"" as that word has a higher chance of having a connotation attached to it.
3. Changing this term does nothing to help the homeless/unhoused population. Because they have similar definitions, no social stigma is decreased in changing it. Homeless is not a slur. Instead of bringing attention to programs and support for the population and trying to resolve the problem, it instead leads to mainly calling out others for being ""offensive"" to the population. Calling out others for being offensive is not a problem on it's own obviously; we should all be kinder to one another, and it's lead to getting rid of outdated hurtful words like the r word. But I do think it's an issue when there's almost no discernable difference between the words' meaning. It defies common sense.

1i0aqbe,CMV: the world would be a better place without Religion,"Hi all, I am I think what you would call an agnostic, basically I am someone who doesn’t know whether God exists or doesn’t exist but I  am against all religions and think all religions are harmful.  I think religion is responsible for wars, it erodes women’s rights, it’s outdated, it brainwashes society, it creates fear and uncertainty, it doesn’t allow people to think for themselves.  Also, it’s just plain evil, for example, in Christianity, the great flood which killed most of the world was unnecessary.  It would make God a mass murderer.  Depending on which Bible verse you read, some could say, “well the Bible says that women are supposed to be ‘ruled over by their husbands’ (book of Genesis)” but some could say “Jesus advocated for equality for all”.  It’s too contradictory.  Islam doesn’t have a great track record for women’s rights and in a lot of Islamic countries women still don’t have a lot of rights which is just plain cruel and wrong.  So yeah that’s why I’m against religion because I just think it’s harmful.  I’m ready for a healthy debate.  CMV.

1hvpmcx,"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media","As far as I understand, the US Congress is trying to ban TikTok because they believe that a big Chinese-owned social media site/app is dangerous because the Chinese government might use it to spy on Americans and push propaganda to them.

I am not trying to be pro-China nor anti-China, but it is undeniable that the political relations between the USA and China are not great, and they are likely to get worse under the new Trump regime. Hence it is within the realm of reason for Americans to be be wary of Chinese agendas. (Again, I do not mean to be anti-Chinese.)

However, in my opinion, all the arguments I have heard about Chinese social media also apply to American social media. From my perspective as a European, the USA is a foreign power led by a dangerously unpredictable right-wing extremist. Elon Musk (who controls Twitter) is a close Trump-supporter, and as far as I can tell Mark Zuckerberg (who controls Facebook) also supports Trump. I don't know about the owners of other major social media such as YouTube or Reddit, but I do not trust any of these people. Any of these might ally with Trump and use their platforms to spread propaganda to support a Trumpist ideology. That could cause a lot of damage to my country and others.

If Chinese-owned social media are dangerous, then American-owned social media are just as dangerous. Especially under Trump, but also without Trump. Hence, if it is reasonable for the US Congress to regulate or ban TikTok, then it is just as reasonable for European countries to regulate or ban American-owned social media such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and also Reddit. 

(One problem, of course, would be that there is not much left. But I am not worried about that. In a hypothetical scenario where the EU bans all non-EU-controlled social media, a few EU-based ones would soon rise to replace them.)

What I have said about European countries may also apply elsewhere; I am hesitant to generalize.",SpectrumDT,605,418,0.7599999904632568,0.1355798730896104,1736250227,/r/changemyview/comments/1hvpmcx/cmv_with_the_same_reasoning_as_the_us_tiktok_ban/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-07 11:43:47
1hvz5o2,CMV: Being Anti-Israel is Not Antisemitic,"There have obviously been a lot of conversations related to this subject, but they've usually focused on other terms such as being pro-Palestinian or anti-Zionism.

For simplicity's sake, I want to avoid using those two terms and discuss the concept of being anti-Israel, while not being antisemitic.

First, I think the conversation around antisemitism is crucial, especially when it comes to the definition of a ""Semite."" This is particularly interesting and ironic when we see the antisemitic label used against Palestinians/Lebanese/Arabs, all of whom are Semites.

When conflicts escalate, tensions rise between entire groups, as we've seen in India and Pakistan, Russia and Ukraine, China and Taiwan, etc. We shouldn’t be quick to label the oppressed party with racist terms, especially when that same group is part of the broader ethnic or cultural group in question. For example, we would never call a Taiwanese person “anti-Asian” for having negative views about China. That would be illogical.

While I understand the history of the antisemitic term and how it predominantly referred to the prejudice against Jewish people, it is important to note that **context** and **power dynamics** are crucial in understanding how perceptions evolve over time. 

Imagine someone in Japan accusing a Chinese person of racism during the atrocities of WWII, all while their government was simultaneously perpetrating violence. Or, imagine a world where Americans labeled black slaves as racist if they had a negative perception of white people.

While outright racism is not generally accepted today, white Americans have developed a deeper understanding of why Black Americans might still harbor distrust in a system that failed them for so long. That's why it would be beyond reprehensible to label slaves in the 1800s as racist for simply being wary of a system that consistently abused and oppressed them. Because that was just their reality; a very similar reality that Palestinians face today.

So, what exactly is wrong with Palestinians who consider themselves anti-Israel? Moreover, what is inherently wrong with *anyone* being anti-Israel?

Using the previous historical examples, we would find nothing wrong with someone who was vocally anti-Japan during the 1940s or anti-America in the 1800s - if anything, we would praise them for denouncing the horrific atrocities that took place.

While it's clear that the ""antisemitic"" label carries more weight than many realize and shouldn't even be used against Arabs/Semites at all IMO, it also shouldn't apply to someone who considers themself anti-Israel unless they discriminate against Jewish people as a whole. Period.

For me, being anti-Israel is my opposition to a brutal Israeli regime that doesn't align with my values. In a similar vein, it's no different than also identifying as anti-Russia or anti-North Korea - an opinion that would produce zero shock value in society. I have strong, opposing views towards Netanyahu, Jong Un, and Putin, and I hope to see all their authoritarian administrations fall, but that does not mean that I dislike or wish harm upon the citizens/races of those countries. That is not only a stretch, but it's patently false.

So, where do you think my reasoning goes astray here, and how do you reconcile the distinction between criticizing Israel as a state and promoting harmful stereotypes against Jewish people?",dunkaroosclues,242,625,0.6200000047683716,0.126577081979207,1736276871,/r/changemyview/comments/1hvz5o2/cmv_being_antiisrael_is_not_antisemitic/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-07 19:07:51
1i0ojk9,CMV: California's insurers are not 'greedy' for cancelling policy renewals,"**Myth #1:** ""They made all this money then just left!"" 

Tyler Perry (a billionaire) is pushing this rhetoric, stating recently: *""Does anyone else find it appalling that insurance companies can take billions of dollars out of communities for years and then, all of a sudden, be allowed to cancel millions of policies for the very people they became rich on?""*

The problem? In the last decade in California, for every $1.00 insurers have collected in premiums, they've paid out $1.09 in claims. Not only have they not made any money, they've suffered *heavy losses*. 

**Myth #2:** ""They're canceling these people's policies so they don't have to pay the claims!""

Outside of non-payment of premiums or fraud, California law prohibits insurers from canceling an insurance policy *during its term*. 

What they're canceling is the *renewal* of the policy. 

**Myth #3:** ""They're just *greedy*!"" 

* Over the past decade, the average combined ratio for the U.S. homeowners line was 101.3%, indicating insurers paid out more in claims than they received in premiums.

The last update in State Farm's wiki has their net revenue at a $5.5B *loss* (they're a prime target right now). Did they just forget to be greedy, then?

**Why did they cancel policies (renewals), refuse to take on more, and try to exit California altogether?** 

Because California made it impossible for them to function properly as an insurer. 

In 2017, voters passed a measure with support of the Newsom regime that heavily regulated the insurance industry under the guise of keeping home insurance ""affordable"". 

\- This required insurers to get approval from regulators before raising rates.   
\- They could only assess their rates based on historical losses in California, instead of forward-looking risk assessment  
\- California quickly became the worst state in the country for the disparity between actuary assessed rate (people who determine future risk and determine what premiums should be), and the regulatory approved rate.  
\- They delay for regulatory approval/rejection approached 300 days on average  
\- They were also prohibited (until very recently) from passing on the cost of reinsurance (insurance for insurance companies, basically) to customers. 

So the result was in effect the inability to function properly as an insurer, exposing themselves to catastrophic risk, and the necessity to pull out of these areas altogether less face bankruptcy. 

This has nothing to do with ""greed"". And if it does, the greed was on the part of Californians who thought they're too special to have to pay more for living in a disaster-prone area, and insurers should just be bending over backwards to lose money for their customer's benefit.

1ibbe8c,"CMV: Colonialism was basically inevitable and some other power would eventually do it, if Western Europe didn't","From 16th century onwards, European powers had a really unique combination of opportunity and necessity. They had the means to start colonizing large swaths in the rest of the world and it perfectly fitted the economic needs of the slowly industrializing society. 

What on the other hand wasn't at all uncommon around the world was the desire for conquest and power and complete lack of morals towards achieving these goals. Be it the Qing China, the Mughals or the Ottomans, you would find countless examples of militaristic empires willing to enslave, exploit or genocide anyone standing in the way of their goals. Most African or American empires were maybe less successful, but hardly morally better in this regard.

Even if Europeans somehow decided to not proceed with colonizing the rest of the world, it was only a matter of time until another society undergoing industrialization needs the resources and markets and has the naval power to do exactly what the Europeans did. There was no moral blocks, which would prevent this from happening. 

If the Americas didn't get taken by the Europeans, they would simply face industrialized China or India a few hundred years later. Or maybe it would be the other way around. But in the fragmented world of the past, a  clash would eventually occur and there would probably be a winner.

1i6o4wa,CMV: The polarization between liberals and conservatives in America is due to the underlying belief of conservatives that 'they're all corrupt anyway',"When Trump is criticized I've noticed his defenders usually don't try to defend him of against negative things he's accused of. The response is usually ""you really think he's going to do that?"" or ""they're all corrupt!"" There is a belief deep down that none of these guys will actually care or do anything that helps regular people. All the other beliefs about Trump are built on top of this underlying belief and vary from person to person. Some people like the rallies and want to have fun, some will like his gesturing at acquring territory, some like him telling it like it is. There are variations but it mostly boils down to screw the establishment. 

This is why attacks from the opposition don't land. Assuming the MAGA supporter is arguing in good faith, the opposition has to not only point out that Trump and his circle did something bad, that it was worse than what democrats have done at any point, AND they have to overcome the MAGA supporters view of their naivette. 

Imagine you hear someone say the following:
""You really think they're going to forgive student loan debt? How are you going to pay for that?""
You could respond ""well we could cut the military?"" but you've already lost because the next response is inevitable. ""that will never happen"". They don't believe that what your saying is possible.

When Trump is criticized, I’ve noticed that his defenders often don’t directly refute the negative accusations against him. Instead, the responses are more like, “You really think he’s going to do that?” or “They’re all corrupt!” At the core of this is a deep-seated belief that no politician—Trump included—truly cares about or helps regular people. This foundational mistrust shapes how supporters interpret criticisms of Trump.

Beyond this, individual reasons for supporting Trump vary. Some people are drawn to the rallies and enjoy the sense of community and fun, others appreciate his tough talk or gestures toward bold actions like acquiring territory, and many simply like that he challenges the establishment. While these motivations differ, they share a common thread: frustration with the political status quo.

This is also why attacks from the opposition often fail to resonate. For a MAGA supporter arguing in good faith, it’s not enough to point out that Trump or his circle did something bad. The opposition would also need to prove that it was worse than anything Democrats have done and somehow overcome the supporter’s underlying belief that systemic change is impossible.

Imagine someone says, “You really think they’re going to forgive student loan debt? How are you going to pay for that?” You could reply, “We could cut military spending,” but the response is inevitable: “That will never happen.” At this point, the debate isn’t about facts or policies but about a broader worldview. Many of these supporters don’t believe systemic change is possible and see those who advocate for it as naive.

I'm not really dedicating this cmv to attacking the idea Trump is bad. If I had to that would prove my view correct. People here that disagree with me already view me as a complainer and an idiot because I believe sometimes it would be good for a politician to do things for the people and for there to be accountability for crimes. I could say ""What trump did on January 6th was an insurrection"" but i know the response will be ""you retard! guess a bunch of trespassers are doing an insurrection"" or ""this libcuck...explain what Stacy Abrahams said"" or ""this guys biased, the democrats not having a primary is the real insurrection"". Deep down, you believe if someone believes in something like democracy or nobody being above the law that I might as well have said ""in 5 years i want to live on the moon"". its impossible and ridiculous to want better so stop complaining.

1id5i2t,CMV: There is no reason to ever get married without a prenup,"I know this topic has been done before but I wanted to address some popular responses. 

First, my view is that everyone should have a prenup before marrying. You can have a lawyer draw one up for you if you’re daddy big bucks, or you can write one up yourself and have it notarized for some extra credibility. Either way you should have some agreement with your spouse regarding your finances before you marry. 

It’s not about not trusting your partner, but people change. Not only may someone change and turn on you when the relationship sours but in general people change over time and you should protect yourself. 

A common response is regarding inequities in earnings or assets if someone stays home and cares for the house and kids while the other works. But I don’t see this as an issue at all. It’s something that should be discussed ahead of time and the prenup is the perfect avenue to bring up things like that. 
If you plan to have children one day, write up the prenup to lay out how you’ll handle the division of assets ahead of time. If you have a child unexpectedly, add an amendment to your original prenup. 

If you’re worried about being taken advantage of or slighted if you were to divorce, now is the time to find out. Now is the time to protect yourself and see how your spouse reacts. Are they open and willing to share everything with you? Or are they fighting you every step of the way.. very telling. 

If anyone finds a prenup insulting, I’d honestly question their intentions. The goal is to protect both parties, and if you have no negative intentions then it shouldn’t be a problem and honestly might not even be necessary. But you have it anyway just in case. 

My point is that people change. If you’re getting married you’re probably the most in love you’ve ever been, and you’re asking if your partner promises to protect you if you ever fall out of love. Not only can it protect stay at home parents from being left with nothing, it can also protect a successful career from being stolen from you by a spiteful ex.

Can anyone change my mind that there is no reason to ever get married without a prenup?",WeekendThief,134,608,0.6700000166893005,0.1114796691462009,1738186946,/r/changemyview/comments/1id5i2t/cmv_there_is_no_reason_to_ever_get_married/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-29 21:42:26
1hzwscm,CMV: American capitalism is severely flawed and exploitation of the working class is inherent to becoming a billionaire,"Throughout history, it has been evident that the capitalist economic philosophy of profit above all else, little/no government regulation, and letting the uber-rich hoard their incomprehensibly large amount of wealth is a leech on the well-being of society as a whole and leads to a constantly growing wealth divide not only within the scale of country, but on a global scale as well; a very clear divide between ""developed"" and ""less developed"" countries.

I can understand the philosophy behind the free market, having absolute equal distribution of wealth between everyone is ridiculous and creates stagnation in the development of a country. However, an unchecked wealth gap between the working and corporate/wealthy class creates turmoil and division amongst the people of a country. Throughout history, we can see that the uber-wealthy tend to use hatred against fellow people to distract the working class from who is really exploiting them; a scapegoat if you will. 

We can see in current day America that Donald Trump, a billionaire who is also endorsed by (and essentially a partner to) Elon Musk, the richest man on the planet, uses Mexican immigrants as a scapegoat for all the working man's troubles, Grocery prices, gas prices, inflation, etc, while creating tax cuts for the uber wealthy and killing welfare programs and departments, including the Department of Education. Despite the fact that deporting 10 million Mexican immigrants would cripple the American economy, the common working class white American believes it, simply because they are of a different culture and it is very easy to believe that they are the enemy because of human psychology.

The wealthy benefit from this because a working class that is too busy hating eachother is a working class that wont develop class consciousness. The billionaires will still cut corners at their companies and lobby to keep minimum wages stagnant as inflation slowly chips away at the value of the dollar, all while they grow wealthier. 

The unimaginable hoarding of wealth we see in the billionaire class is a cause for most of the economic troubles. There is no justification for one man to own as much wealth as millions of people while there are people who cant eat or drink. To be a billionaire, you must have exploitation at some point along the chain among at least one of their income streams, mainly their companies. Jeff Bezos is a prime example, a man acclaimed to have made his wealth ""by himself"", yet Amazon is notoriously one of the worst workplaces in the entire country for worker who make pennies to Bezos' millions.

I don't call for a total communist revolution within America, I just think that no person should have a billion dollars of wealth to their name no matter what they do as there's no reasonable justification for it that doesn't involve leeching off the working class. The corporate class should be taxed and regulated over ten-fold so that the capitol earned by the people is in the hands of the people.",itszesty0,322,450,0.6899999976158142,0.1081155036216734,1736715517,/r/changemyview/comments/1hzwscm/cmv_american_capitalism_is_severely_flawed_and/,2025,1,changemyview,2025-01-12 20:58:37

1i53y3p,"CMV: TikTok is deliberately suppressing anti-China content, and this is sufficient to justify banning the app.","I've seen a lot of posts about TikTok recently, but relatively few posts with sources, so I thought I'd throw my hat into the ring.  [This substack article](https://thezvi.substack.com/i/142559317/tiktok-promoting-chinese-interests) was what convinced me of my current views.  It's very long, but I'll focus this CMV on what is IMO the strongest point.

In December 2023, a think tank did a [study](https://networkcontagion.us/wp-content/uploads/A-Tik-Tok-ing-Timebomb_12.21.23.pdf) comparing how common different hashtags are on Instagram and TikTok.  Using ordinary political topics like Trump, Biden, BLM, MAGA, etc as a baseline, they found a few significant differences (page 8), but nothing that I don't think could be explained by selection effects.

On the other hand, when they looked at content related to China, [they found a rather different pattern:](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F429fa831-69e8-4faf-bf10-7925282c513c_1042x759.jpeg)

- Pro-Ukraine, pro-Uighur, and pro-Taiwan hashtags are about 10x less common on TikTok as they are on Instagram.
- Hashtags about Tibet are about 25x less common.
- Hashtags about [Hong Kong](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a2856f7-af25-4f08-91cd-fe9a43bf51af_978x1003.png) and Tianenmen Square are over 100x (!!) less common.
- Conversely, hashtags about Kashmir separatism in India are [~1000x *more* common.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51e2a055-b3f3-43f5-8430-f0192da03e97_974x227.png) 

I don't think you can explain this with selection bias.  Absent a coordinated effort from everyone who posts about Tianenmen Square to boycott TikTok, a 100x difference is *far* too large to occur naturally.  The cleanest explanation is that the CCP is requiring TikTok--a Chinese company that legally has to obey them--to tweak their algorithm to suppress views they don't like.

I think this justifies banning TikTok on its own.  Putting aside the other concerns (privacy, push notifications in a crisis, etc), the fact that an unfriendly foreign country is trying to influence US citizens' views via content manipulation--and not just on trivial stuff, on major political issues--is an enormous problem.  We wouldn't let Russia buy the New York Times, so why let China retain control over an app that over a third of all Americans use?

(I'm fully aware that the US government has pressured US social media companies about content before.  That said, if my only options are ""my government manipulates what I see"" and ""my government *and* an unfriendly government manipulate what I see"", I would prefer ""nobody manipulates what I see"" but would settle for the former if that's not an option.)

Here's a few possible ways you could change my view (note: if you can give me links or sources I will be much more likely to award deltas):

- Find major problems with the posted studies that make me doubt the results.
- Convince me that the bill is problematic enough that it's not worth passing even if TikTok *is* manipulating content.
- Show that the US is pressuring social media companies to suppress anti-US content on a similar scale (this wouldn't change my views about banning TikTok, but it would change my views about the US).
- Convince me that most of the bill's support in Congress comes from reasons other than content manipulation and privacy (you'll need a good argument for how strong the effect is, I already know that e.g. Meta has spent boatloads lobbying for this bill but I'm not sure how many votes this has bought them).

1iht2i4,CMV: The new DNC Vice Chair David Hogg exemplifies exactly why the Democratic Party lost the 2024 election,"So for those who aren't familiar, one of the Vice Chairs elected by the DNC earlier this week is David Hogg, a 24 year old activist. There's nothing wrong with that aspect, its fine to have young people in leadership positions, however the problem with him is a position he recently took regarding an Alaska Democrat, Mary Peltola. 

Mary Peltola was Alaska's first Democrat Rep in almost 50 years, and she lost this year to Republican Nick Begich. Throughout her 2024 campaign, David Hogg was very critical of her, saying she should support increased gun restrictions, and then he celebrated her loss in November saying again that she should support gun control, in Alaska. This is exactly what's wrong with the DNC.

In 2024, the Democrats lost every swing state, every red state Democratic Senator, and won only three Democratic House seats in Trump districts (all of whom declined to endorse the Harris/Walz ticket). If you look at the Senate map, there is no path to a majority for the Democrats without either almost all of the swing state seats or at least with a red state Democrats. Back in Obama's first term, the Democrats had seats in Montana, Missouri, West Virginia, and both Dakotas, but in 2010 after supporting the ACA and a public option on party lines they lost most of them, and in 2024 after supporting BBB on party lines they lost all of them. 

My view is that the Democrats are knowingly taking a position that its better to lose Democrats in redder areas than to compromise on certain issues, something that has recently been exemplified by the election of a DNC Vice Chair that celebrated the loss of an Alaska Democrat. I think if this strategy continues, they will go decades without retaking the Senate and likely struggle to win enough swing states to take the Presidency again either.

1iu4qpq,CMV: the Democratic Party isn’t up for this,"For context, I’ve been politically active my whole life in the US and have pretty much always been a democrat, volunteered for campaigns, flew to Nevada for this election, etc. 

It pains me to say it, but the party isn’t up for the task of dealing with what’s happening right now and is essentially a failed party, in need of near wholesale change at the leadership level. 

Here are the main points:
1- they don’t know how to get media attention
2- they have no actual plan to resist the trump administration 
3- they have no clear articulate message for what they stand for, leaving a vacuum for maga to fill it in for them 

Chuck Schumer’s grand resistance plan was to release a new bill to counter the dismantling of federal agencies (and called it “stop the steal”) and it made zero news. 

The opposition party needs to be rising to the level of intensity in this moment. Sit ins on the house floor, getting arrested if need be. They need to be running ads and other paid media now like if they were running a campaign. They need to be a real political party. 

Every day that goes by without major fight is a lost opportunity and shows that they just aren’t up for it.

1imbzi7,CMV: Trump Will Mark the Beginning of the End of the U.S. as a Global Superpower,"For the past 80 years, the United States has been *the* dominant Western superpower—militarily, economically, technologically, and culturally. However, Trump's presidency, particularly his second term, has made it clear to the rest of the world that the U.S. can no longer be relied upon as a stable military ally or a self-regulating democracy with effective checks and balances.

For decades, much of the Western world has relied on the security and global leadership of the U.S., particularly through NATO. But now, many of us are waking up to the reality that this reliance is no longer viable. Regardless of the fact that a significant portion of Americans oppose Trump and everything he represents, the fact remains: the country elected him—*twice*. This suggests one of three possibilities:

1. A deliberate and conscious choice by the public to embrace Trump’s leadership.
2. The result of institutions so weakened, corrupt, or manipulated that public ignorance was effectively engineered—potentially by external forces that stand to benefit (it would certainly align with known Russian geopolitical strategy).
3. A mix of both—some voters knowingly supporting him while others were misled by systemic dysfunction.

I say this as someone from Spain, where, like many other European nations, we have neglected our own capacity for self-defense, relying instead on NATO and the security provided by an allied nation that spends more on its military than the rest of the world combined in any given year. But Trump's America has demonstrated that this reliance is no longer sustainable.

In just three weeks (!) since his second inauguration, Trump and his administration have already threatened military action in **Panama, Gaza, Greenland**, and have come dangerously close to doing the same with **Canada**—one of the closest and strongest alliances in the world. Instead of military threats, he has chosen economic coercion to undermine Canada’s sovereignty.

People are not stupid. You can call these tactics “negotiation strategies,” “distractions,” or whatever justification you want—but that doesn’t change the long-term consequences. Whether intentional or not, Trump’s actions have made it clear that NATO, Europe, and the broader Western world can no longer depend on the United States as the so-called “world police” (a sentiment that has existed since Vietnam and solidified with Iraq).

European leaders are already acknowledging this, openly discussing the need for greater military and economic independence. And while Europe has its own issues—particularly the resurgence of far-right populism—Trump’s second term offers a *real-time case study* in how democratic institutions can be undermined from within. This might, hopefully, give European governments enough time to reinforce their own institutions before a similar phenomenon takes root here.

Beyond geopolitics, Trump’s America is also self-sabotaging its academic and technological leadership. The U.S. has long attracted the brightest minds in science, technology, and research, but under Trump, those systems are being crippled. If you are a top researcher, why would you choose to work in a country where:

* Salaries might be higher, but the quality of life is worse?
* You have unrestricted access to guns but limited reproductive rights?
* Free speech is celebrated on social media but censored in academic research?

This will inevitably lead to *brain drain*, further accelerating the decline of U.S. leadership in innovation, science, and education.

Yes, in the short term, Trump’s aggressive trade policies might secure *favorable* economic deals, but they come at the cost of severely damaging U.S. alliances and international trust—possibly beyond repair. It does not matter if Trump comes out tomorrow, apologizing for everything, and saying he is sorry (lol). Why would any country *trust* the U.S. again in the next 20 years?

I don’t see a way back from this. CMV. ",hakezzz,5465,996,0.8399999737739563,0.47563966738385,1739209340,/r/changemyview/comments/1imbzi7/cmv_trump_will_mark_the_beginning_of_the_end_of/,2025,2,changemyview,2025-02-10 17:42:20

1iy6p6m,CMV: The Palestinian and leftist obsession with Zionism is counterproductive to Palestinian statehood,"The obsession with Zionism as it relates to the Middle East conflict is pointless. Zionism is simply the idea that Jews should have a homeland in the Middle East. No more, no less.

Zionism has nothing to do with what the borders of Israel should be. Zionism does nothing to preclude a Palestinian state right beside it. The reason why there’s no Palestinian state has nothing to do with Zionism, but rather because the Palestinians have rejected every offer for statehood, including a proposal in the 1930s that would have given them 80% of the land. Zionists at the time accepted this proposal because the goal for statehood trumped all other considerations. 

Rather than campaign for Palestinian statehood, or work towards anything that would such a goal feasible, the obsession with Zionism is seemingly the most important task. Just this week Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) advertised a a workshop titled ""Smash Zionism."" 

Fighting against Zionism is fundamentally bizarre because Israel exists. Zionism as a movement succeeded. Israel has been a country for nearly 8 decades and is one of the top 20 global economies in the world. Love it or hate it, it’s a REALITY and isn’t going anywhere. Yet the crux of the Palestinian movement doesn’t seem to be rooted in the creation of a Palestinian state, but in fighting Zionism - basically fighting against the existence of the state of Israel. The Palestinian movement is seemingly more interested in reversing the outcome of a war that ended more than 76 years ago than anything else. .

And yet, the word Zionist is tossed around as some sort of slur. I even heard a classmate last year say something like “I was going to see a concert last weekend but found out the lead singer is dating a zionist.”  This seems utterly backwards. Someone who believes Israel should be a country is now reprehensible? Even being associated with someone like that is now a social crime?

The fixation on opposing Zionism does little to change the reality that Israel exists and will continue to do so. Energy spent on resisting an entrenched national identity could be better directed toward constructive efforts that promote justice, reconciliation, and sustainable solutions for both Israelis and Palestinians. Recognizing Israel’s existence does not mean endorsing all of its policies, just as opposing certain policies does not require rejecting any country's right to exist.

The Palestinian (and also the Left’s) obsession with zionism is counterproductive because it shifts focus away from practical solutions that could improve their political and social realities. Opposition to zionism is an ideological battle rather than a pragmatic strategy that can do ANYTHING to help Palestinians.

By concentrating all their energy on zionism - instead of pursuing realistic political avenues—such as diplomatic negotiations, state-building, and economic development—Palestinians have thrown away every opportunity for progress because they’re not fighting for the creation of their own country but instead for the destruction of another. A nationalist movement rooted in destruction cannot succeed - and hasn’t.

Nations do not cease to exist because of ideological opposition, and history shows that successful liberation or independence movements prioritize pragmatism over ideological battles. If the most important aspect of Palestinian liberation is anti-zionism, well, the Palestinian movement will remain stateless in perpetuity.

The most effective movements throughout history have been those that recognize the realities on the ground and adapt accordingly, rather than clinging to outdated struggles that do not lead to concrete change. Stories of Palestinians who still have the keys from 1948 to a house that no longer exists might be good to trigger an emotional response, but it's an absolutely backwards political strategy that feeds off false hope and the delusion that Israel is just a temporary entity.

As someone who wants peace in the region between all people's, what am I missing? Is focusing on framing Zionism as the ultimate evil something that accomplishes anything practical? From my vantage point it seems like it does a good job of spreading negative PR about Israel but almost nothing to actually help the Palestinian quest for self-determination.",thatshirtman,214,2024,0.5400000214576721,0.3823112615166351,1740519703,/r/changemyview/comments/1iy6p6m/cmv_the_palestinian_and_leftist_obsession_with/,2025,2,changemyview,2025-02-25 21:41:43
1ip1btt,"CMV: MEN, if you want a stay at home trad wife, then you directly support alimony.","Men generally say they want a traditional wife, who stays home, raises the kids, and takes care of the household. At the same time, these same men complain that alimony is unfair to men in divorce cases.

They conveniently forget that alimony literally exists because women historically weren’t allowed to work, and even today, women still often sacrifices their career to be a full time homemaker, she loses years (or even decades) of work experience, skill development, and retirement savings. If the marriage ends, she’s at a serious financial disadvantage compared to her husband, who continued earning, advancing in his career, and securing his financial future.

The very tired rebuttal I always get from my fellow is essentially “women initiate most divorces, so they shouldn’t get anything.” If a woman spends 20 years raising kids, maintaining the home, and supporting her husband’s career, only to file for divorce (and you believe she should walk away with nothing just because she initiated the divorce) then you never truly supported the trad wives to begin with. You supported a system where she financially depends on her husband, but the moment she decides to leave, you think that dependence should be punished.

If you genuinely believe in the traditional roles, you also accept the responsibility that comes with it. If a woman devotes her life to supporting a man’s career and raising his children, why should she be left with nothing if the marriage ends?",Cajite,2250,1327,0.8399999737739563,0.3638245557879859,1739503345,/r/changemyview/comments/1ip1btt/cmv_men_if_you_want_a_stay_at_home_trad_wife_then/,2025,2,changemyview,2025-02-14 03:22:25

1iqpkgw,"CMV: The increasingly vague usage of ""DEI"" as a term is to help enforce segregationist policy or silence/invisibility","Terminology is a powerful thing, when we stop using words'meanings we can start to divorce and lose the concepts. Diversity, equity inclusion, and accessibility are very generalized terms for potentially dozens to hundreds of different forms of programming and initiatives. Increasingly it has been used as a dog whistle term much like affirmative action to be a stand in for the Boogeyman of racial quotas. However that fails to really address the increasingly broad application of the concept by those seeking to destroy it. This broad application of the term appears to be used to essentially mean: Any acknowledgement of non-white, non-cis, non-able bodies, judeo-christian men is considered an extension of DEI.

Recently plaques were covered that the  Cryptology Museum in Maryland and women in STEM have found articles about their work or even mentioning their being highlighted have evaporated. How does acknowledging the hard work overcoming historical obstacles do harm? How does it detract from society and how does hiding them improve the federal government or save money? Rumors are surfacing that National Park Services staff are not only facing firing but are being asked to scrub local history, especially as it related to ""DEI"". As many may know cancer and other medical research *needs* a focus on gender, race, etc. (Data  doesn't care about whether the  population fits our ideals, data is data and not having that data is a problem for real people of all kinds). It simply appears that acknowledging unique history or the struggles of a group are being seen as innately un-American which was a common Civil Rights refrain. MLK, SNCC, was seen as just as un-American as the Black Panther Party or even their white allied organizations. To speak on Rosa Parks or to just state facts about the Stonewall Riot is framed as unnecessary in the context of anti-DEI and removed from historical and state documentation.

What furthers my belief is the release of DOGE's plan to essentially move from eliminating programs to an undefined description of firing any employee tied to DEI activity...without ever defining it oreven limiting it to ""Within their official role as a federal employee"". Based on that idea, going to a PRIDE parade, being a member of the NAACP, or potentially having been in a student union in college could be reason to let someone go. What's to stop a group of DSS workers from being fired for making their own little work group to trade tips for managing ADHD? What would stop an investigation from happening because a senior engineer decided to take three autistic new hires to lunch because that engineer also is autistic and just is happy to spend time with similar peers? Would an HBCU graduate speaking at an HBCU graduation be a problem? Increasingly the answer is all of these situations are suspicious and harmful because the definition is intentionally broad

 Quite frankly, there's no definition of ""DEI"" which is much scarier than affirmative action because it could be applied in incredibly sweeping generalizations.

If this anti Diversity and accessibility crusade was about unfairly focusing on historically marginalized groups harming people with more historical access to baseline opportunities etc. Why would we need to erase any mention of the past acknowledgememts or stop anything regarding research in the medical field? If this is about stopping unfairness then why isn't DEI more narrowly defined and why would they go after individuals generally involved in any ""DEI programming?

It is not logical to believe it is harming a white man to also study why prostate cancer is having X affect more often on Asian men. There is no tangible benefit to anyone in that example and perhaps general risk to both groups due to not identifying or isolating unique information that may further our general understandings.

I was also raised in a very liberal family, always taught to never judge others, be kind to everyone, diversity is amazing, black lives matter etc (my entire family is like this).

1izafgc,CMV: The American public is unwilling to fight for regime change.,"I do not want to have some debate on individual policies, I am focused on the idea that the American public is simply unwilling to do what it takes change the current situation.
  
As events have gone on, I've had many discussions in person and online regarding things. I've been somewhat politically active in person, more than most, and I think that's where my hope is slashed - I've done the bare minimum and sacrificed little. And as far as I can see, there are less than 50k people in the entire country are willing to even get off their chair for a couple hours.
  
Most Americans won't take a penny out of their pocketbook to enact change. Hell 40% of them couldn't even bother to vote, even if they had their ballots mailed directly to them! 
  
Precisely nobody is doing anything to stop what appears to be a constitutional crisis, but hey, get owned eggs rose in price! That should get everyone out of their chairs. Cost so much it's unaffordable to doordash them!
  
Change requires sacrifice and Americans just won't do it. Costs too much to protest. Rush hour traffic. Might be seen by boss. 
  
And the haunting fact that 1/3-1/2 of the country approves of what's going on doesn't make me feel better. But a million of them showed up for their guy. None have shown up to stop theirs.
  
I hope someone can change my view. It makes me feel quite alone. I see someone here or there don't feel as alone, but then again, a million showed up to try to forcefully keep Trump in power. I've not seen a million on the streets. I don't think I will. I don't think itl break 100k in a single day.

1itzpg1,"CMV: The US is firmly now an unpredictable adversery, not an ally to the Western world & should be treated as such.","And we should have been preparing to do it since the previous Trump presidency. 

But with his labelling of Ukraine as a dictatorship yesterday & objection to calling Russia an aggressor in today's G7 statement today Pax Americana is firmly dead if it wasn't already. And in this uncertain world, we in Europe need to step up not only to defend Ukraine but we need to forge closer links on defence & security as NATO is effectively dead. In short, Europe needs a new mutual defence pact excluding the US.

We also need to  re-arm without buying US weaponry by rapidly developing supply chains that exclude the USA. Even if the US has the best technology, we shouldn't be buying from them; they are no longer out allies & we cannot trust what we're sold is truly independent. This includes, for example, replacing the UK nuclear deterrent with a truly independent self-developed one in the longer term (just as France already has), but may mean replacing trident with French bought weapons in the shorter term. Trident is already being replaced, so it's a good a time as any to pivot away from the US & redesign the new subs due in the 2030s. But more generally developing the European arms industry & supply chains so we're not reliant on the US & to ensure it doesn't get any European defence spending.

Further, the US is also a clear intelligence risk; it needs to be cut out from 5 eyes & other such intelligence sharing programmes. We don't know where information shared will end up. CANZUK is a good building block to substitute, along with closer European intelligence programmes.

Along with military independence, we should start treating US companies with the same suspicion that we treat Chinese companies with & make it a hostile environment for them here with regards to things like government contracts. And we should bar any full sale or mergers of stratigicly important companies to investors from the US (or indeed China & suchlike). 

Financially, we should allow our banks to start ignoring FACTA & start non-compliance with any US enforcement attempts.

The list of sectors & actions could go on & on, through manufacturing, media & medicine it's time to treat the US as hostile competitors in every way and no longer as friendly collaborators.

To be clear, I'm not advocating for sanctions against the US, but to no longer accommodate US interests just due to US soft power & promises they have our back, as they've proven that they don't.

1iy695u,"CMV: White men and Christians are NOT being “attacked” or “persecuted”. They are just experiencing public backlash and being held accountable for the first time, and now, they are playing victim.","I keep seeing this rhetoric about how Christianity and the white male is under attack in America. I believe that these populations are just finally experiencing backlash , made possible with things like the internet and free speech. 

Take the “make loneliness epidemic” for example. Young men have began blaming everyone but themselves for not being able to find a girlfriend. With women becoming more independent over the past several decades and moving away from the trad wife role, they’re now able to be a little more picky . Theyre also making more money on their own. There’s no reason to settle for someone who isn’t right for them in the long term, whereas in the past, women felt much more obligated to men  because of the dependence dynamic. 

Because the trad wife / male provider idea has been around for a while, young men are still being raised to believe women need them, that women must be homemakers, and they feel entitled to a wife. Men never had to try very hard in the past too find a wife because , like i said, women were not in a position where they could be picky. Now, women are getting educated and working , and men are falling behind because they never saw value in that, and just assumed they would magically get a wife someday. There are so many men nowadays who expect a trad wife , but without themselves playing the role of the provider. They get pissed whenever women don’t like them , all because women have much higher standards and expect to be treated with the same amount of respect as anyone else. Men don’t realize they are not entitled to a wife, and there’s no reason for any woman to be with them if they don’t want to be. So now They just start blaming women for “asking for too much” , they blame the government for everything being expensive and not being able to make more money than their woman counterparts, they blame “woke” for everyone becoming “too sensitive and entitled”, etc. They blame everyone but themselves for the situation they’re in, they take no accountability, and now they’re playing victim. 

It’s similar with Christianity. Christianity was always , *AND STILL IS*, the majority religion in the USA. However, with the country evolving and being more accepting of lifestyles outside of the traditional Christian life, and with the internet giving more voice to people to express their disdain for the religion, they now think they’re under attack. All that’s really happening is that people are freely voicing their opinions about the religion , and how they feel the religion has been harmful to their existence in some way. There have been no laws or regulations passed that outlaw or hinder the practice of Christianity in any way, in fact, white Christian men are currently running the country. 

They just feel that the very existence of anything outside their view of traditional family values is an attack. Being allowed to fly a pride flag at a school is not attacking Christianity. Trans people simply existing in public spaces is not an attack on Christianity. Gay marriage is not an attack on Christianity. if the person certifying the marriage is a Christian, and is obligated by law to certify that marriage, that is not an attack on Christianity. Allowing other ideals and belief systems to exist in the same space as Christianity is not an attack on Christianity. If a gay man gets online and expresses his disdain for the religion , because his Christian family disowned him, that is not an attack on Christianity. That is someone voicing their opinion, which they are allowed to do, and that is someone who is having an emotional response to being harmed in the name of Christianity. Not everyone has to agree with or follow your religion. If you can’t take it, don’t dish it out. As long as an entirely Christian government can be elected into office by will of the people, the religion is not being persecuted. There is no reason to play victim. 

TLDR; White Christian men have finally been held accountable for all the oppression and harm they’ve inflicted onto everything they touch. Now, the world is figuring out we don’t need to depend on men or Christianity to survive, and they now must actually earn the respect of people. However, they still have the same sense of entitlement they had before, they aren’t trying at all to catch up with society and other part, and are now playing victim all because no one views them as superior anymore— hint, they never were superior. The “male loneliness epidemic” proves this , with white men feeling entitled to the respect of women,  and the Christian “traditional family values”.

However, this post is specifically addressing the people who after going through Trump's first term decided to elect him again. for example this person here: https://archive.is/2025.02.27-114505/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/27/fired-federal-worker-trump-voter/

During his first term Trump did so many questionable things including:
1. Denying that he lost the election and refusing to concede which let to the insurrection.

2. Put doubt on he's own health departments covid response.

e.t.c

1ihdctq,CMV: Islam's Prophet muhammad was a horrible and disgusting person,"I'm an ex Muslim, and one of the biggest reasons I left islam had to do with all the disgusting things that Muhammad said and did throughout his life. 

Muslim apologists and dawah people love to portray him as an amazing human being, someone who was a flawless and timeless example for all of mankind, and if you're not that knowledge it's easy to be deceived into believing such things. As a muslim when I would hear about some of the more disturbing things he did from critics I would just brush it off as either inauthentic or taken out of context. 

As I became more religious and started studying more, I came across things he did and said that either didn't make any sense or were just straight up disgusting. Some of those things include: Marrying a literal child, forbidded eating with the left hand, commanding the execution of apostates, had several sex slaves, said that women who pluck their eyebrows are cursed, married up to 9 wives at one time even though the quran permits men to marry no more than 4, said that black dogs are devils, said women who wear perfume are like adulterous whores, said that men who wear trousers over their ankles will go to hell, forbidded music and other types of art, and so much other horrible and ridiculous shit.

1ij2io3,CMV: Conservative non-participation in science serves as a strong argument against virtually everything they try to argue.,"So many things we are forced to argue these days are talking points that scientific study has already settled. But since there's one side of the aisle that eschews science, we have to work against viewpoints like ""I just know in my mind that such-and-such is true"", which is, needless to say, incredibly frustrating and pointless.

Remember, of course, that even something as simple as collecting historical data and summarizing it counts as a study, and papers are routinely published on those lines. Randomized clinical trials are not the only form of study out there.

Some examples: immigrant crime. So many studies show definitively how immigrants commit FAR fewer thefts, rapes, and murders than native-born citizens, and yet we still have to contend with viewpoints that immigrants are more commonly associated with murder, rape, and theft than the average native-born US citizen. Studies show that gender-affirming therapy very, very rarely causes anyone, *even children*, to regret the therapy they were given, and yet we still have to contend with viewpoints that gender-affirming therapy is likely to screw people up for life. Numerous studies show the effectiveness of all sorts of different types of gun control implementation, and yet we still have to contend with viewpoints that gun control is, across the board, wholly ineffective. 

The most important part of all this, and the part that I hope to discuss the most, is this: if you think the data supports your opinion, *a study would have come out saying so by now*. It mystifies me that people think there are still major stones unturned in the study of everything. Do you realize how hard it is to find a topic of study these days, because of how everything has been studied to death? Why is it that we would all laugh and nod in agreement if I said ""seems like there's a new study coming out every time I breathe"", and this has been true for probably over a century now, and yet you still think maybe we don't have a study analyzing whether gender-affirming treatment actually works? 

It's not even a valid excuse to say that science has a liberal bias...looking at the vote counts of the 2024 US Presidential election, there are at least 75 million conservatives out there. You are really telling me that there was not a single one of those 75 million people who liked science, who had an aptitude for science, who went to school for a scientific field and chose to study some issue that was a big deal to his political persuasion? Not one of the 75 million conservatives did this? Really? *Really?* And if it were a matter of finding a place to publish, are there not numerous conservative research institutes like The Heritage Foundation who would publish your research? Is there otherwise some lack of funding and power amongst conservatives that restricts them from starting journals of their own where they can publish this research? (I hope there's not a single person on the planet who would say yes...)

It's hard to take any angle seriously when it is only argued from a place of internal mental reasoning, rather than from citation of evidence, ESPECIALLY when it is something we should be able to easily settle by looking at the numbers. I rarely, rarely see conservatives do this, and it seriously undermines their credibility. In my experience, they really will answer ""what evidence do you have that X happens?"" with ""common sense"" and they think they've actually scored points in a debate, rather than admitted that they have no proof to back up what they're saying. It's astonishing, really.

1izkhsl,CMV: The image of the US police force will never recover because of the mindset on using unmarked/stealth cars,"I firmly believe that the police force image in the US will never heal until they adopt a mindset similar to Europe. Most European countries use brightly marked cars for their police force because you're supposed to easily identify and approach them. 

 The US police force and their image will always be at odds with their citizens as long as they regularly use stealth/unmarked cars. Every encounter turns into a sneaky gotcha moment and are what keeps people distrustful. Extends to their uniforms too. Most wear some form of black or blue as it helps them blend in. There's no reason unless your mentality is to surprise.

There's a time and place for unmarked cars. That time and place is when you have a perp or bust you know about in advance. Not a random encounter with a citizen. They operate like every encounter is a sting operation. IMO they'll continue to fail unless that changes.

1ioyoy4,CMV: TikTok should have been permanently banned in the US,"When TikTok was temporarily blocked in the US back in January, I uninstalled it, thinking it was gone for good. Turns out, it was only down for a few hours, but even now, downloading it from the App Store or Play Store is still impossible. New users can’t get it, and anyone who deleted it—like me—was locked out.

Yesterday, I saw a post on Reddit saying that TikTok is now letting people install it again through [tiktok.com/download](https://www.tiktok.com/download), bypassing the app stores entirely. So technically, nothing is stopping me from reinstalling it… but I don’t want to.

I used to spend 2-3 hours a day on TikTok. When I uninstalled it, I expected to replace it with something else—another app, another distraction. But that never happened. I just stopped wasting time. Now, looking back, I don’t think I was enjoying TikTok as much as I was just stuck in it.

This whole situation made me realize that maybe the ban should’ve been permanent. If TikTok had stayed fully blocked, millions of people would’ve naturally moved on, like I did. But now that it’s creeping back in, people are rushing to reinstall it without questioning whether they actually need it.

1izqtzv,CMV: The Economic Blackout Boycott will fail entirely.,"I believe the Economic Blackout Boycott on February 28th will fail entirely because the threat of no sales for a day is effectively null.

Let’s say the movement includes 100% of all adults in the US (It most certainly will not). Even if they all stop buying most large scale companies will have customers outside of the US. And for there to be any effect on companies it would need to at least last several months. They’re threatening literally nothing. Most people don’t even buy things every day so many won’t even do anything different.

Even if they decided to make it last 4 months most people can’t do that. You’ll find that every product you buy somewhere in the chain will have a mass produced item from a huge company. And most items can’t be made at home. This won’t be like the colonial times where people could make the goods at home with some decreased quality. You cannot simply make gasoline at home or build a computer chip entirely from scratch. 

Plus this only affects individual consumers not any of the companies that receive stock from them. And what about those little businesses you care about so much that receive some of their product from the large corporations. 

Once the boycotts over people will go back to buying what they would’ve bought yesterday. And if they were to continue the boycott for months then what happens when companies start to fire employees. People are now losing jobs because of your silly little boycott. You’re harming the people too. Obviously this won’t happen cause people aren’t gonna boycott literally everything except the Amish run companies who run entirely separate from the rest of society. 

If you want to make a change then you need to target specific companies that you can live without, are entirely based in the US, and boycott them for months to years. 

This entire “boycott” is barely even a boycott. Your not exercising your power over the mega corporations your showing your reliance on them and unwillingness to go without the essentials for more than a day.

I've spoken to MAGA people. They are ok with this. They actually want this. One actually said that they need to act fast before midterms and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to move at the pace of the tech world and not at the pace of politics.

  
Meanwhile, dems are at worst silent, at best taking to the streets about how this is illegal and an abuse of power and all of the above.

Whats the problem with that?

\- the big one is that dems complaining actually just fuels the issue even more. The firsts thing people say is yeah of course they are unhappy, what do they have to hide? how much fluff have they supported over time? etc

  
\- the second one is that they spent the entire campaign talking about how great everything is. clearly its not. clearly people feel SO bad about things that half the country is not only willing but excited to burn it all to the ground

\- they are too busy being partisan and having empty threats and lawsuits while Elon continues to dismantle the government

  
What do the dems actually need to do? They need to acknowledge that things are terrible. They need to acknowledge that there is a lot of government spending that is completely unnecessary. **They need to start pointing out other parts of the government where Elon Musk can focus on. This one is key. If they can work with DOGE then not only would dems be able to protect the more important parts of the governemnt, like say the FAA, but also help actually improve the problem of excess spending.**

Many conservatives praised Elon Musk for taking over Twitter, saying he would restore free speech. But under his leadership, Twitter has banned journalists who criticized him, suspended accounts tracking his private jet, and suppressed posts from political opponents.

If it was wrong for Twitter to censor conservatives before, why is it okay now?

Some conservatives argue that businesses should be free from government interference. But in states like Tennessee and Florida, they’ve pushed for laws restricting drag performances and LGBT content, even in private businesses.

If conservatives oppose government control over businesses, why support laws dictating what people can perform or express?

Conservatives often defend companies rights when it comes to political donations or free market decisions. But when companies take stances they don’t like, such as Disney opposing Florida ""Don’t Say Gay"" bill, suddenly they advocate for government retaliation.

Whether it be right wing politicians, people in person or people online. I’ve seen politicians call these people “poison” and “vermin” just like how Hitler talked about the jews, and their main focus is Mexicans and South Americans and Africans. Never have I seen them talk about the thousands of Russians, Western Europeans and Canadians that are here illegally. Plus the propaganda about how all immigrants are rapists and gang bangers, which is just factually untrue. There are so many of them here just working to provide for their kids and then there’s a few bad apples in Colorado and they use it to push their agenda that these people are “dangerous criminals”. Miss me with that. 

On top of that, the MAGA party wanting to change “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America”, taking the Spanish option off of their website and ICE detaining people just for speaking Spanish in public seems pretty racist to me. They aren’t going after criminals they’re going after anyone who is brown and speaks Spanish. If they just want to deport the criminals then why are they trying to enter churches and elementary schools??

Trump now wants to start something up in Guantanamo Bay that is more or less a concentration camp. If it’s all about just getting these people out and having them come the “legal way” then why hold them in a camp on in a dangerous place. Also if they’re “pro immigration” as long as it’s legal why is this administration trying to make that process harder??

I’ve never heard a good argument against immigration that isn’t rooted from racism and stereotypes. These people add billions to our social security every year, they pick our vegetables, build our houses, create new jobs and contribute greatly to our economy. Anyone who knows this knows our country won’t be better by getting rid of them, but they’ll just repeat the “they’re all criminals!” And “they’re raping our women!” Until they’re blue in the face with no facts to back it up. Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, how does immigrants being here affect our lives negatively at all??

1ijftfn,CMV:  Canada and other US allies feeling bullied by Trump should start to poach its skilled citizens and businesses.,"Trump has essentially thrown the gloves off and turned the US into an untrusted partner.   This is not something that will just go away as US allies know that the next 4 years at minimum and probably longer will show an unstable US that cannot be trusted to do the right thing going forward.  The reason for this is that the GOP now has full control of all 3 govt branches, SCOTUS has a conservative super majority, and no one is holding him accountable.   Any change that could happen in a 2028 election would be viewed as temporary given the US’ swinging pendulum back to right wing extremism.   

To become more competitive against the US, allies should start to look at how to encourage highly skilled scientists, medical professionals, engineers,  ex-military, businesses, etc to immigrate from the US that have either been targeted by Trump, feel endangered by fascism, or simply disenchanted with being a US citizen going forward.  Industries like green power,  tech, higher ed, medical research etc. that feel they don’t have a future would be prime candidates for targeted incentives and proactive recruitment.   

Creating a program like “Canada Wants You” could be seen as an inclusive way to bring more talent and create growth for their economies.   A master plan would need to be created to prioritize industries to fund incentives and recruitment while also considering location to not overwhelm existing infrastructure.  An example would be a country establishing or maturing a space industry and targeting NASA, SpaceX or Boeing engineers to emigrate to their country. 

 

Counter arguments may be: 

\-Canada or other allies don’t have the money to incentivize large scale immigration:  This would be a fair argument, but investing in the future to become more competitive would be worth taking on debt.

\-Other countries don’t have the same pleasant weather that states like California have:   This would apply to Canada and other countries in northern latitudes, but Spain, France and Italy have decent alternatives for those that simply can’t handle cold. 

\-Individuals may not take the incentive as they have a family: The program would need to take this into consideration that perhaps the immediate family (including adults) would be accommodated as long as they have the means to make money and pay taxes.

\-Trump would retaliate with additional penalties:  No doubt that this would be the case given Trump’s actions lately.   That said, this program would result in a better long-term situation for the country receiving top talent and businesses.   Trump could offer the same thing to the countries by encouraging immigration to the US, but I believe that scientists and skilled professionals seeing what is happening will be turned off by the anti-intellectual behaviors of the US. 

\- Countries can’t handle the additional stress on their infrastructure:  As already noted, a master plan for this program would need to include the infrastructure related improvements to accommodate the additional immigrants.

\- US salaries are much higher than many of the other countries:  This is probably the biggest blocker.    The countries would need to pay for top talent and the country would need to come up with incentives like no taxes for 5 years, bonuses for coming, equity stake etc.  This could also lead to some animosity by the country’s citizens, but like a franchise player getting paid megabucks, it should be worth it if it drives innovation and competitiveness.

1imkufo,CMV: Hating Men as a trauma response is not a valid excuse.,"I feel like we can all agree that generalizing a group of people in general is awful, especially if based on anything biological or out of their control. However, I've noticed a lot of people, mainly women, saying that they hate men, or at least consider them to be mostly terrible compared to women. When confronted with these ideas I've also noticed a common retaliation of their trauma with men, very often having to do with assaults, emotional manipulation, or just being straight up creepy. While I think that those are terrible things that nobody should ever have to go through and explain at least why they have their distain towards men, it's a very invalid reason to express that men in general are bad. It's similar with considering certain ethnic groups to be less-than because you happen to have been mugged by people of that group on occasion.",BeautifulOrganic3221,329,809,0.699999988079071,0.1658711132271879,1739231183,/r/changemyview/comments/1imkufo/cmv_hating_men_as_a_trauma_response_is_not_a/,2025,2,changemyview,2025-02-10 23:46:23
1iy1m6i,CMV: The American Left and Democratic party are fractured beyond repair.,"As of now, I feel politically homeless, less in terms of party, but more in terms of ideology and political approach to things. Moderates blame progressives for lacking any strategic caution, policy nuance, and long term coalition building. Progressives blame moderates for doing too little when in power and being tied too much with corporate consultants and donations. There is little  sense of working together here. In my honest opinion, both moderate & progressive voters and politicians alike refuse to address their own shortcomings, and acknowledge the strengths that the opposing faction has. Each faction seems to want to feel and how  they are somehow intellectually and morally superior than the other when the truth is that they both have good and bad ideas.  I am simply sick and tired of the infighting! At the end of the day, neither of these factions can function properly and win elections at the federal, state, and local levels without each other's collaboration. Instead of going on a circular firing spree like how we are seeing now after the 2024 election and have been seeing since the 2016 election, both moderates and progressives should  take the best ideas from both of their groups. Why not? Why not choose to coexist and coopt each other's strategies? What's the harm in doing that? What's the harm in moderate Democrat voters/politicians acknowledging that they need to take a more grassroots and populist approach to campaigning, rhetoric and governance? What's the harm in progressive Democrat voters/politicians acknowledging the nuance in solving our systemic issues, and the importance of carefully building coalitions to build support for their agenda? They do realize that they can chew gum and walk at the same time?

If I had to describe where I am in politics, I would say that I lean progressive when it comes to the need of generating grassroots excitement by  adopting populist rhetoric & bold approach to governance. But, I also agree with the moderates that it's also really important to carefully build coalitions to garner support for policies that help ordinary Americans, to acquire enough financial resources to help out candidates at the local and state levels too, and to acknowledge the affect online misinformation & algorithms have on the electorate and how to counter that by building up the Left's own online information apparatus to reach Americans. 

So, in general, I just feel lost right now. What we are seeing is a void in the Democratic party leadership. Neither faction seems to want to unite the party.  I believe that what is needed now is a sort of new kind of approach that has best of both worlds from the Progressives and Moderates, and ends up combining them into one unified and coordinated plan & unique identity. If there was a name/;label for this kind of approach or any kind of group that actually adopts the best ideas from both factions, then I would proudly to associated with it; because I don't really consider myself  a truly Progressive or Moderate democrat. I'm afraid there probably never will be someone or some group within the Democratic that will actually take the best ideas from both factions in a way that unifies the party. 

I am open to insights that argues that this infighting will only be temporary, and I am willing to consider any model, political approach, Democratic faction, etc.... whatever out there in the United States that aligns themselves with a strategy that seeks to build bridges between Progressives and Moderates, ultimately uniting them.

1itx4hk,CMV: Trump recent comments on Ukraine prove he's basically a Russian asset,"So, Trump recently called Zelenskyy a “dictator” which,let’s be real, is straight out of the Kremlin’s playbook. Russia has been trying to paint Ukraine’s government as illegitimate since day one to justify their invasion. Now Trump is repeating that same narrative, right when U.S. support for Ukraine is on shaky ground.

This isn’t just a one-off. There’s a pattern here:

He Keeps Echoing Russian Talking Points! Whether it’s doubting Ukraine’s legitimacy, suggesting NATO is useless, or taking Putin’s word over U.S. intelligence, he has a history of saying things that conveniently benefit Russia.

He’s undermining ukraine right when it needs support most! By calling Zelenskyy a dictator, he’s fueling skepticism about military aid, which plays right into Putin’s hands.

It’s not just Words, it’s actions too! Let’s not forget that Trump literally withheld aid from Ukraine in 2019, leading to his first impeachment. Even now, he’s openly saying he’d let Russia do “whatever the hell they want” if NATO countries don’t pay up.",No_Discussion6913,1103,498,0.8700000047683716,0.1504096845662947,1740053714,/r/changemyview/comments/1itx4hk/cmv_trump_recent_comments_on_ukraine_prove_hes/,2025,2,changemyview,2025-02-20 12:15:14

Try explaining to them that a huge number of people here—who have never experienced real hardship—genuinely believe that being asked to stay home, practice basic hygiene, and wear a mask was the greatest oppression of their lives. Many of them have no idea how brainwashed they became because they’ve never been able to see it from an outside perspective. Yes, some people worldwide fell for similar disinformation, but the scale was nowhere near what happened in North America. While people in impoverished countries were dying in droves, struggling to get access to vaccines, privileged North Americans—convinced by conspiracy theories—thought the government was ""out to get them"" and planned to throw them in camps. And now, those same people overwhelmingly support an actual fascist leader who is literally building camps and prisons for his opposition. The lack of empathy, the complete ignorance of global struggles, and the deep entitlement have turned many into unwitting pawns of right-wing ideology. The avenues of propaganda—from so-called “natural health” influencers lacking critical thinking, to incel culture, to marginalized communities who (rightfully) remember past government abuses but fail to see today’s reality—is staggering. And, of course, the openly bigoted groups who already aligned with right-wing politics only strengthened their position.

1im9cjp,"CMV: All hate symbols should be banned, or allowed.","A few of my relatives and several family friends spent months and years wrongfully detained and tortured by the Castro regime of Cuba. My entire family was broken apart as they had to flee the country to other nations and although we stayed in touch we were never able to be reunited. My dad for example could not see his parents when they were dying not even attend their funerals.

It is the same story for tens of thousands of people that suffered under the iron fist of Fidel. 

I find it pretty ironic that we ban Nazi symbols with some countries like Australia now giving people jail time for doing a Nazi salute, but at the same time I can walk into a German bar themed as the Cuban revolution with portraits of Fidel and Che covering the walls, watch movies on Netflix about the “humanitarian” work of Che and even go to Amazon and order a printed t shirt with his face. It makes me sick to my stomach.

Hitler, Lenin, Mussolini, Castro and Che were all war criminals promoting an ideology that killed millions and thousands of people, imprisoned and tortured millions and thousands more. 

So why do we judge them so differently? Maybe because executing 15,000 people it’s not nearly as bad as 6 million?

1ig5g5l,CMV: Trump's focus on politically loyalty over expertise resembles Soviet-Era communist failures.,"Trump, today, is making no mystery of the fact he is firing anyone in government who would enforce a law he ""does not like"" or ""thinks is stupid"" (sorry, 47 admin's wording there). While you hear much about parallels to alt-right fascism, I am actually more reminded of the failures of East Germany and the USSR.

The mentality looks to be driven by two primary engines: the ""unitary executive/committee"" and ""rooting out intellectuals.""

For the unitary executive theory, the USSR and East Germany believed the government existed only to execute the commanding party's agenda. It was acceptable for the executive or executive committee to fire and retaliate against anyone in government who acted against the party's political agenda under this framework, even when the actions that instigated firing or retaliation were driven by legitimate laws there to protect society, the environment, etc. I'd offer that this is exactly the Trump/MAGA attitude today. Regardless if federal law dictates employers hire disabled or racially diverse people when they can, it is acceptable to fire the FAA director for following that long-established federal law, because it does not serve the commanding party's interests.

As for ""quieting"" and ""rooting out"" intellectuals, this again seems to be a Soviet-Era failed posture that Trump/MAGA are adopting full-steam. Real, premiere doctors and researchers look set to be stifled from innovation by a bureaucratic system RFK, Jr., will construct with party loyalists. The same can be said with cybersecurity and defense experts, who will face bureaucratic systems designed to stifle and perhaps even retaliate against real scientists any time they present an idea that is at odds with the MAGA-consensus view. I shudder to think what Trump might have in mind for intellectuals who would risk ""humiliating"" him for failed policies and directives, but at the very least we know he is willing to fire and ridicule them through public posts to social media...

All of this to say, people seem very eager to not repeat the horrors of WW2-era fascism in Germany, and certainly there are reasons to be concerned about that in today's climate. But what I see from Trump and Co. today looks very much more like bureaucracy designed to insulate the unitary executive and stifle intellectuals and their innovation unless it serves the political needs of MAGA. That sounds like Soviet-Era communism that came and failed in East Germany after the war.",FinTecGeek,1842,231,0.8999999761581421,0.141132335959782,1738524783,/r/changemyview/comments/1ig5g5l/cmv_trumps_focus_on_politically_loyalty_over/,2025,2,changemyview,2025-02-02 19:33:03
1izak0w,CMV: requiring a gun license to own a gun in America is not unconstitutional.,"When I came to the United States from Spain at age 14 I learned in US history class about the 2nd amendment, and concept unknown to me in Spain. We did not go over it much but what I did gather was that it was written to stop Congress from disarming state militias in case the states felt Congress and the Presidency were exceeding their constitutionally prescribed power. As I grew up I learned that it actually protects an individual right to own a weapon. I thought this was absurd as I saw many claim this was to be without restriction at all and seeing all these school shootings made be doubt the modern day use of such a right to be completely unrestricted. I support the individual right to keep and bear arms however I recently did learn that Justice Antonin Scalia did write that this right was not unlimited and can be subject to reasonable regulation and was not absolute. This makes perfect sense to me. Like, the 1st amendment protects the right of an American neo-Nazi to say “fuck the Jews” but most likely does not protect the right of them to say “let’s go kill jews.” That is one example. Another one is that the state where I live in (Wisconsin) has its own 2nd amendment clause that reads “The people have the right to keep and bear arms for security, defense, hunting, recreation or any other lawful purpose.” The state of Wisconsin recognizes the right of its citizens to bear arms for the purpose of hunting but also does require hunters to obtain a license to hunt. So this means that in American law a right can be protected but also regulated with reasonable regulation. “Well regulated” in the 2A means “trained” or “disciplined” so requiring proficiency in weapons before acquiring one seems reasonable and lawful.


I have seen many 2A advocates say that 2A grants them an unregulated right to arms yet my 2 examples and Justice Scalia prove to me at least that a licensing system where background checks, proficiency and safety tests are required to obtain a firearm legally are constitutional and do not infringe on our right as American citizens to keep and bear arms.

1iwnuxk,CMV: MAGA is a scam that exploits the working class,"The “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) movement was never about making America great. It was never about empowering working-class Americans or restoring economic prosperity for those left behind by globalization, automation, and corporate greed. Instead, it has always been a scam—a carefully engineered distraction to stoke resentment, sow division, and keep ordinary Americans too angry at the wrong enemies to recognize they are being systematically exploited.

Donald Trump and his billionaire backers built MAGA on the promise of fighting for the “forgotten Americans”—the blue-collar workers who saw their jobs disappear, the rural communities left hollowed out, and the families watching their wages stagnate while their cost of living skyrocketed. He made them believe their suffering wasn’t caused by corporate greed or billionaire tax cuts, but by immigrants, minorities, liberals, and a so-called “deep state” working against them.

It was all a con.

MAGA isn’t a movement for working-class Americans—it’s a branded identity, complete with red hats and rally chants, designed to make its followers feel like they’re part of something bigger while ensuring they never realize they are being exploited. Instead of helping struggling Americans, MAGA’s real function is to distract, divide, and exploit.

Step One: Exploiting Economic Anxiety with False Promises

From the start, Trump positioned himself as a champion of the working class, promising to bring back manufacturing jobs, stop outsourcing, and put American workers first. But every single economic policy enacted under MAGA did the opposite.
- The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Trump’s signature policy, overwhelmingly benefited the top 1%, giving billionaires and corporations massive tax breaks while offering crumbs to working-class Americans.
- Corporations used their tax breaks for stock buybacks, not job creation, further enriching CEOs and investors while leaving workers with stagnant wages.
- Factories continued closing, and automation expanded, eliminating more jobs—a reality Trump never addressed.

Meanwhile, MAGA supporters pay a higher tax rate than many billionaires. While everyday Americans see a chunk of their paychecks disappear to taxes, billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and even Trump himself exploit loopholes, offshore accounts, and special tax breaks to pay far less than the average worker.
- A firefighter or teacher might pay 22-24% in taxes, while billionaires often pay an effective tax rate of less than 10%—sometimes even zero.
- A 2021 report revealed that some of America’s richest people paid zero federal income tax in multiple years, while MAGA supporters were left covering the cost.

The working class is paying for the billionaire class to get richer—yet MAGA convinces them their enemy is a poor immigrant or a liberal college student instead.

Step Two: Manufacturing an Enemy to Hide Who’s Really Screwing You Over

The genius of MAGA isn’t just in its false promises—it’s in its ability to make its supporters blame everyone except the actual people exploiting them. Every time Trump or his allies betrayed the working class, they fed their base a new villain:
- Immigrants are taking your jobs! (Reality: Corporations are outsourcing jobs and automating labor to increase profits.)
- Minorities are getting all the government benefits! (Reality: The biggest beneficiaries of government subsidies and tax breaks are billionaires and corporations.)
- Liberals want to destroy America! (Reality: Billionaires on both sides profit from division while ordinary Americans struggle with rising costs and stagnant wages.)

Instead of uniting Americans against the people who actually rigged the system—corporate elites, Wall Street, and political insiders—MAGA encourages its base to fight a cultural war against their fellow citizens. If you can convince a struggling factory worker in Ohio that their real enemy is an undocumented immigrant in Texas or a lesbian barista in Brooklyn, they’ll never stop to question why their boss just got a massive tax cut while their wages stayed the same.

Step Three: Suppressing the Vote to Maintain Control

MAGA leaders know that if more people vote, their hold on power is at risk. So instead of winning elections through popular support, they focus on voter suppression tactics designed to keep working-class Americans, particularly minorities and young people, from voting.
- Closing polling places in minority neighborhoods makes it harder for Black and Latino voters—who tend to vote Democratic—to cast their ballots.
- Strict voter ID laws disproportionately affect lower-income Americans who may not have driver’s licenses or easy access to government offices to obtain IDs.
- Purging voter rolls under the guise of “election integrity” often removes eligible voters, forcing them to jump through bureaucratic hurdles to re-register.
- Gerrymandering districts to dilute the power of working-class and minority voters ensures that even when MAGA policies hurt the people they claim to help, the system is rigged to keep them in office.

Trump and his allies spread lies about voter fraud not because fraud is a real issue—it isn’t—but because they need an excuse to justify voter suppression tactics that keep power in the hands of the wealthy. If everyone who was eligible to vote actually did, MAGA would collapse overnight.

Step Four: Keeping Americans Distracted with Endless Culture Wars

MAGA is not about policy—it’s about emotion. It thrives on outrage and grievance because if Americans ever stopped fighting each other long enough to look at the policies being enacted, they’d realize they were being conned. That’s why Trump and his allies keep their base hooked on an endless cycle of manufactured outrage.
- Instead of addressing rising healthcare costs, MAGA tells its followers to be mad about trans people in bathrooms.
- Instead of tackling corporate monopolies and stagnant wages, MAGA wants its base obsessed with whether someone knelt during the national anthem.
- Instead of fixing America’s broken education and job training programs, MAGA convinces its base that the real crisis is “woke” teachers indoctrinating their children.

This is not accidental. The more energy MAGA voters spend fighting these battles, the less likely they are to recognize the real scam happening right in front of them.

Step Five: Keeping the Working Class Down and Powerless

The final piece of the puzzle is ensuring that working-class Americans stay frustrated, poorly educated, and economically insecure—because an empowered, informed working class would be a threat to billionaire rule.
- MAGA Republicans push massive cuts to education funding because an educated population is harder to manipulate with lies and propaganda.
- They work to gut workers’ rights and labor protections because if people had strong unions and higher wages, they wouldn’t be as desperate or easily controlled.
- They fight against universal healthcare because nothing keeps people more dependent on their jobs (and less willing to fight back) than the fear of losing health insurance.

The system isn’t broken—it’s working exactly as intended. Billionaires don’t want independent, secure, well-educated Americans. They want a desperate, divided, easily misled population that will keep voting for the very people exploiting them.

The Hard Truth: MAGA Is a Scam—But Its Victims Keep Defending It

The tragedy of MAGA is that its biggest victims are the ones defending it most fiercely. Millions of working-class Americans, manipulated by fear and resentment, have been tricked into fighting for billionaires who are actively making their lives worse. They cheer for tax cuts they’ll never see, fight for industries that will never return, and defend a system that ensures they remain trapped in a cycle of economic frustration.

And when the next election comes, they’ll be told once again that their real enemies aren’t the billionaires hoarding wealth, the corporations sending jobs overseas, or the politicians voting against their interests. Instead, they’ll be told to blame immigrants, minorities, LGBTQ+ people, college students, and “coastal elites.” And once again, the cycle will repeat—because as long as MAGA keeps Americans angry at each other, they’ll never turn their anger toward the people actually responsible.

MAGA isn’t about making America great again. It’s about making sure the rich stay rich, the powerful stay in control, and the working class stays too divided and misled to do anything about it.

1ig96ua,"CMV: There will be a US presidential election in 2028, but it will not be free or fair.","As we know, in the final months of the last Trump administration, President Trump, along with many Republican politicians both in Congress and in his administration, tried to overturn the result of the 2020 election. This culminated in the botched coup attempt on January 6th 2021.

Trump did this without the support of the broader government bureaucracy or the military, and nevertheless got surprisingly close to succeeding, or at least to causing the greatest constitutional crisis since the civil war. As I write this, he and his new administration are working to reshape the federal workforce, rooting out, deliberately or not, all those who wouldn't cooperate with a second coup attempt.

Further, while the attempt in 2020/21 was unsuccessful, no one at the top has faced any real consequences, least of all Trump himself. Nothing has happened since 2021 that might convince him that a second coup attempt is not worth it.
  
As a result, I believe that Trump and his administration will try again, one way or another, and that this time there's a good chance they'll succeed. 

To change my view, you'd have to convince me that either:
1) Trump did not try to overturn the 2020 election result, or;
2) he did but has since changed his mind and would leave office peacefully in 2029, or;
3) another coup attempt would most likely fail. 

Clearly, as Trump's re-election shows, there are a huge number of Americans who don't agree with me on this - so what am I missing?


Notes:

I think for clarity I should point out that I'm aware that constitutionally Trump cannot run in 2028. I'm assuming here that the Republican candidate in the next election will be either Trump's anointed successor, be that JD Vance or whoever else, or even Trump himself utilising some kind of loophole.

Similarly, I've deliberately not discussed the exact mechanism(s) by which the 2028 election could be subverted.

1im0mun,CMV: Trump's plan for Gaza is painting a target on the back of Americans.,"History has apparently taught us nothing.

Terrorists have attacked the West over what they consider to be forms of Western Imperialism in the past.

His current direction is an unapologetic and unambiguous foray into bona fide modern day imperialism. The situation in Palestine was cited by Bin Laden as one of the key motivations behind 9/11.

I'm sitting here pulling my hair out over what seems to be such an obvious and foreseeable disaster being sleepwalked into, not just from a humanitarian POV on behalf of Gazans but on behalf of the very Americans Trump is supposedly representing.

Trump and Musk are likely too cowardly to take on the military industrial complex that has been mishandling our tax dollars for years (decades?) and make a real dent in budget deficits so have resorted to going after programs that represent <0.1% of the federal budget because they can use buzzwords that appeal to their nationalist base.

1ihplop,cmv: Pro-lifers that carve out exceptions for rape are morally inconstant.,"I would like to start by saying that this is not a pro-life vs pro-choice post. That's not the point of this CMV, so I won't be engaging with the comments that are arguing for/against pro-life.

In the discussions on reddit about abortion, you'll often see pro-choicers demonize pro-lifers for not carving out exemptions  for rape when they are discussing their views. You'll see pro-choicers justify their view by saying that someone shouldn't carry their rapists baby. This is a completely fair view with in the context of bodily autonomy. The problem is that this view doesn't matter in the context of ""all human life has some inherent value"" the way that pro-lifers believe.

The life of someone who was conceived by rape isn't any less valuable than the life of someone who was conceived in some other manner. So for the people who believe that all human life has some inherent value and should be protected, why would it make sense for them to carve out exceptions for rape?

Why wouldn't it be considered morally inconsistent if they make those exceptions?

Every single day of every single hour, Trump and his admins are saying crazy shit that they have no intention of doing or no ability to do, in an effort to pass their true agenda which is siphoning off wealth from the United States. 

[Ezra Klein explains it perfectly ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s)here talking about Steve Bannon: ***""The opposition party is the media, and  because they're dumb and they're lazy they can only focus on one thing at a time all we have to do is flood the Zone.

This is exactly what is happening. We are falling for it. The airtime that a lot of his verbal garbage has gotten in the past two weeks is a smokescreen for what is going on behind the scenes. 

  
People are falling into the trap of letting themselves be distracted (including myself). There cannot be any organized movements or coordinated efforts of masses of people listening to federal employees and appointed officials because everyone is spread thin between outrage and fighting about Gaza, Trump Coin, Greenland, Tariffs, Nata, Ukraine. There is no singular point to focus on.

  
Trump knows that a lot of what he says will not get passed, but it does not matter. Because the lying, deceit and corruption is so normalized. 



I just don't see how these past two weeks have been anything other than the democrats/non-maga people being anything other than helplessly playing into his hand. At every point he wins. Even when he looses he wins because nobody cares. He controls the spin. As far as he and his supporters are concerned he wins every single encounter. 

Trump is using the tinkerbell effect to certify himself as the winner. He won the tariffs because he has the largest microphone and everyone who is glued to watch his daily outrage are falling into his web. His ratings, his ""bad publicity is better than no publicity"". The mass confusion. 



Am I wrong? I feel that Project 2025 and Steve Bannon laid out that plan years ago. Like Brave New World, the true dystopian nightmare is that the truth is not some hidden conspiracy.

1isdzij,CMV: r/Conservative posts are getting pushed to the front page with little engagement,"Posted this in r/nostupidquestions originally, but it was removed for being a rant, so hopefully I can get an answer here. So, like some others have also noted, I’ve been getting more posts from the conservative subreddit pushed to my popular page, and I noticed that there’s a big discrepancy between the upvotes on the post itself versus the top level comments.

Here's what I mean:

Political and current event posts usually get a LOT of engagement, a post that has ~4000 upvotes usually has a top comment with upvotes between 800 to 2400, but the r/conservative posts that are getting around 4k votes have top comments around 200. 

Why such a huge difference? Are people really scrolling through Reddit, upvoting the post but not reading or voting on any of the comments?

On top of that, the comments are weird too. I know it’s a heavily moderated subreddit, but the comment count versus the amount of comments you can actually see is an order of magnitude in difference, and when you click on the collapsed replies most of them have nothing there. Don’t removed comments show as deleted?

I realize that I might just be ignorant of how Reddit works, and I’m not trying to make this a political post. I’m genuinely looking for an answer here, and thanks in advance.

Some examples from the last couple days:

1iy3qwp,Cmv: media control is the right's sacred cow,"
I've noticed a trend. When you point out to a right winger that the media is obviously influenced the most by the right, they act like you just parked a UFO in their yard. As though it is beyond their imagination that anyone could ever even say such a thing. Is this a foundational belief of the right, upon which all of their other propaganda rests? Is this their [Original Lie](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1h0c7dm/a_practical_definition_for_religious_nationalism/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)?

Yes, you can look around in some spaces and see a clear bias towards the left. Yes, reddit kind of is one of those spaces. But the world outside of reddit exists and those spaces are dwindling rapidly. It makes sense that reddit would be a place that right wing troll farms can't target as easily as other social media sites - the moderation is too decentralized and random, and frankly reddit's really not that popular. The dominance of right wing media would have been an effort that was ""just getting started"" in social media and so would have targeted the low hanging fruit of twitter, facebook, etc. But surely, now that the right seems to have won everything else, reddit is in the pipes..

Anyway, the point is the last \~40 years of media landscaping was kicked off by republicans, and exclusively republicans, reversing the fairness doctrine. Whatever the media landscape looked like back then, it is the right who saw it and decided with their resources the game was winnable if they could exclude speech from the left, even if that meant the left could in turn exclude speech from the right. And, 40 years later, it seems they were correct. The way they did it, I used to think, was just by hammering on ""trickle down"" as their original lie. But no one really buys that anymore - even though 77 million people just voted for it, very few of them will claim that it works with a straight face and instead claim that they voted for him for other reasons (never mind that trickle down is the *only* thing republicans consistently do).

So perhaps all along the 'left controls the media' was the *repeat repeat repeat* they were hammering on and I didn't notice it was a trick because I thought it was true, too. But it's hard to explain the rightward lurch of the nation any other way. It's hard to explain some other way that a guy who tried to start a civil war on live television could be considered a viable candidate by anyone at all. I'm convinced if the election had been held on January 7, 2021 Kamala would have won by an order of magnitude. But the media was given four years to make it look normal and every single media outlet did so, even those considered on the left were careful to include the language of the right - under the guise of criticizing it - to make sure the left understood what the right was saying, while the right never heard a peep from the left. 

Too much of what the 'liberal media' does is too ineffective at actually progressing the left's agenda and it rings of controlled opposition. Democrats lose and lose and lose. The only time they ever win is when republicans tank the economy so catastrophically that the media can't cover it up. And then after democrats fix it up, republicans win again despite the fact that they just tanked the economy. I understand this sounds conspiratorial but keep in mind it is also exclusively the right who bought the Citizens United ruling, which basically said all campaign speech is for sale and no one gets to know who the buyers are or how much they paid. Rich people don't become rich by wasting their money. Buying the Citizens United ruling was expensive and took decades. They didn't do it for nothing. Do you know who was having the time of their life during the first great depression? Rich people. A third world country to rule is their paradise. I have zero doubt that they want to ""make depressions great again.""

I laugh every time people bring up campaign fundraising because none of it matters. That's what you pay campaign staff with but what use is that when one side's backers own entities like IHeartMedia or Sinclair that donate their entire platform to their cause? Campaign funding is pointless if it isn't spent on getting people to vote for you and the left sees fewer of those sorts of things for rent every day, as the right buys them up.

Anyway, kind of a tangent. Maybe, it wasn't even really a lie originally. But I do suspect that, from the start, the right planned to repeat it constantly forever, knowing full well it was going to gradually get less accurate. Truth Social could one day be the only media in the country and probably a third of the right would still say the media is controlled by the left - while the other two thirds just say it's only fair since the left controlled the media for so long (even though they didn't, fairness isn't something that can be balanced over generations anyway, and again it was republicans who revoked something literally named the fairness doctrine).

I just don't see a future in which republicans admit they control the media but also admit that they shouldn't. Can anyone convince me otherwise?",normalice0,155,544,0.6100000143051147,0.1079847673914806,1740512391,/r/changemyview/comments/1iy3qwp/cmv_media_control_is_the_rights_sacred_cow/,2025,2,changemyview,2025-02-25 19:39:51
1iy3g36,"CMV: Russia should be held accountable for invading Ukraine, and they shouldn’t be allowed to veto their own punishment","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a clear violation of international law and sovereignty. The fact that Russia, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, can veto any resolution aimed at holding them accountable is deeply troubling. It’s like allowing a criminal to veto their own punishment—how can we expect justice when the perpetrator has that kind of power?

The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Russia’s actions (93 to 18), but the Security Council’s structure gives Russia the ability to block any real consequences. This is not just a flaw in the system; it’s a serious issue that allows a nation to act out wildly, without facing the repercussions of their aggression.

If Russia is allowed to continue this unchecked, it sets a dangerous precedent where powerful countries can invade others and avoid consequences simply because they have the power to block action. That’s not how international law should work. If we believe in sovereignty and accountability, we need to reform the U.N. and prevent Russia from using its veto to avoid facing the consequences of its actions.

How to change my view: 
If presented with evidence that Russia was not in the wrong in invading Ukraine, and that somehow it was Ukraine’s fault, I would be open to reconsidering my position. Also, if you can explain to me how having five permanent powers in the U.N. is more fair, especially when those countries are acting in bad faith, and how it’s justifiable for them to have a veto on being held accountable for their actions, that would also help change my perspective.",PoolShotTom,1238,222,0.9399999976158142,0.107083423212218,1740511643,/r/changemyview/comments/1iy3g36/cmv_russia_should_be_held_accountable_for/,2025,2,changemyview,2025-02-25 19:27:23
1ir5tyk,CMV: Trump Misunderstands Trade Deficits and It’s Hurting Americans,"Trump repeatedly claims that a trade deficit means the U.S. is “losing” money to other countries. This is fundamentally incorrect. A trade deficit is not government debt—it simply means a country imports more than it exports. In reality, trade deficits can be a sign of economic strength, and Trump’s misunderstanding of this basic concept has led to misguided trade policies that hurt both American businesses and consumers.

**1. A Trade Deficit is Not Like Owing Money**

The U.S. trade deficit means Americans buy more goods from other countries than they sell abroad. But that doesn’t mean money is just disappearing. Foreign countries use their U.S. dollars to invest back into the American economy, whether through purchasing U.S. stocks, bonds, or real estate. The U.S. benefits from a trade deficit because it gets cheap imports, which lower costs for consumers and businesses.

**2. The U.S. Trade Deficit is Largely a Result of American Economic Strength**

The U.S. has a massive trade deficit in goods, but a surplus in services (like finance and technology). Americans have more disposable income than many other countries, so they buy more imports—that’s a sign of consumer power, not weakness. A strong U.S. dollar makes imports cheaper, which naturally contributes to the trade deficit.

**3. Trump’s Tariffs Backfired and Proves he Doesn’t Understand Trade**

Trump’s tariffs on China didn’t reduce the trade deficit—they actually made goods more expensive for Americans. Instead of fixing the deficit, Trump’s policies led to retaliatory tariffs, which hurt American farmers and manufacturers. The damage was so severe that Trump had to approve a $28 billion bailout for farmers during his first term to offset their losses. If his trade policies were actually working, why did U.S. farmers need a government bailout? The trade deficit with China remained high because businesses just shifted supply chains to other countries like Vietnam and Mexico. The U.S. International Trade Commission reported in 2021 that tariffs raised prices between 1.7% and 7.1% in the ten most affected sectors, including apparel, car parts, furniture, and computer equipment. These findings are one of the many studies that indicate tariffs often result in increased costs for consumers, as importers and retailers adjust prices to offset the additional expenses.

**4. If Canada Stopped Exporting Oil, It Would Run a Trade Deficit With the U.S.**

Trump loves to complain about the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, but he ignores that it’s largely because Canada exports massive amounts of oil and raw materials to the U.S. If Canada stopped exporting oil, it would run a trade deficit with the U.S. because it imports more U.S. manufactured goods than it sells back in other sectors. Said raw materials and crude oil are then refined and manufactured into higher-value products by American companies, who sell them for a profit. This means the U.S. isn’t just “losing” money to Canada—it’s leveraging Canada’s exports to fuel its own industries. Trade deficits don’t mean one country is “winning” and another is “losing”—they’re just a reflection of what different economies specialize in.

Trump sees trade as a zero-sum game where the U.S. “loses” if it imports more than it exports. However, that’s not how trade works. Trade deficits can actually be beneficial, and Trump’s ignorance on this issue has led to harmful policies that hurt American workers, businesses, and consumers.",ChazzioTV,1201,232,0.8700000047683716,0.1069308305862532,1739748544,/r/changemyview/comments/1ir5tyk/cmv_trump_misunderstands_trade_deficits_and_its/,2025,2,changemyview,2025-02-16 23:29:04

1igar20,CMV: DEI was a Trojan horse that killed affirmative action and acted as a midwife to MAGA,"DEI was used by corporations to gain social and societal currency. It has always been performative, virtue signaling lacking in intellectual rigor. It has been used as a trojan horse to force ultra leftist identity politics down everyone’s throats, and as a result inadvertently hijacked the black liberation movement. 

Affirmative Action (AA) was born out of the black liberation movement. It had far more teeth and had actual legal backing. DEI stripped it of its power by shifting the focus from enforceable systemic correction to voluntary corporate optics. With affirmative action, failure to act had real consequences. With DEI, failure to act means a company simply updates its branding.

AA mandated hiring goals, quotas, and enforceable accountability measures. DEI, on the other hand is voluntary, self-policed, and lacks any real enforcement mechanism. There’s no requirement to actually hire, retain, or promote diverse talent at scale.

AA was about outcomes, increasing representation through concrete hiring and admissions policies. DEI, in contrast, moved the conversation to “awareness” and “culture”, allowing companies to look progressive while maintaining the same power structures.

AA explicitly targeted **historically oppressed racial groups, acknowledging the need for corrective measures due to centuries of discrimination.** DEI shifted the conversation to include everybody else’s problems.

Since DEI isn’t legally binding, corporations easily and often manipulate it for PR without real investment. Many companies make grand DEI and ESG commitments, but internally have toxic work environments, lay off DEI teams, slow down diversity hiring, and maintain overwhelmingly white leadership. 

It alienated and fueled animus from white men— often making its biggest mistake of openly demonizing white men who were always the primary antagonist for every group. Many DEI initiatives framed white men as the default oppressors while elevating everyone else, often through surface-level representation efforts. Instead of fostering genuine coalition-building, DEI created an “us vs. them” dynamic. This is why I believe it can definitely take some credit for the birth of MAGA. DEI absorbed the language of justice without the obligation to deliver it, effectively neutralizing the radical potential of affirmative action.

DEI became a softer, more palatable alternative to AA. It was designed to placate demands for systemic change while maintaining corporate and institutional power structures. Its blindspot was always white men who were actively ostracized from its objectives.

1j0yfzf,CMV: “America First” Somehow Keeps Putting Russia First,"
Trump sat across from Zelenskyy, an ally whose country is literally being invaded, and instead of backing him… he mocked him. Called him “disrespectful.” Accused him of “gambling with World War III.” Then he stormed out and killed a minerals deal that would’ve benefited the U.S. because, apparently, humiliating Ukraine was the bigger priority.

And who benefits? Russia. Again.

I hear the arguments… some of you think Zelenskyy is dragging this war out instead of negotiating. Or that he’s too reliant on U.S. aid and isn’t “grateful enough.” Maybe you think Ukraine is corrupt, that this is just another endless war, or that backing them will drag us into something worse.

But let’s be honest, what’s the alternative? Let Russia take what they want and hope they stop there? Hand them pieces of Ukraine and pretend it won’t encourage them to push further? That’s not peace, that’s appeasement. And history has shown exactly how well that works.

As for the money… yes, supporting Ukraine costs us. But what’s the price of letting authoritarian regimes redraw borders by force? What happens when China takes the hint and moves on Taiwan? Or when NATO allies realize America only stands with them when it’s convenient? Pulling support doesn’t end the war; it just ensures Ukraine loses.

And the corruption argument? Sure, Ukraine has problems. So do plenty of countries we support—including some we’ve gone to war for. But since when does corruption disqualify a country from defending itself? If that’s the standard, should we stop selling weapons to half the Middle East? Should we have abandoned France in World War II because of Vichy collaborators?

You don’t have to love Zelenskyy. You don’t even have to love Ukraine. But pretending that walking away is anything but a gift to Russia is either naïve or exactly the point.

But let’s be real. If someone invaded America and told us to hand over Texas or NY for “peace,” would you? Would Trump? Or would we fight like hell to keep what’s ours?

Trump doesn’t seem to grasp that. He talks like Ukraine should just fold, like it’s a bad poker hand he wouldn’t bother playing. He doesn’t see lives, homes, or an entire country fighting for survival… just a guy who didn’t flatter him enough before asking for help. 

Meanwhile, Putin doesn’t even have to lift a finger. Trump does the work for him, whether it’s insulting allies, weakening NATO, or making sure Russia gets what it wants without resistance.

So if “America First” keeps making life easier for Russia, what exactly are we first in?",MrBootsie,8938,1728,0.9200000166893004,0.9808013355592656,1740832296,/r/changemyview/comments/1j0yfzf/cmv_america_first_somehow_keeps_putting_russia/,2025,3,changemyview,2025-03-01 12:31:36
1j8qwwt,"CMV: If Democrats Gain Full Control, They Have Every Right to Prosecute Republicans and Their Allies Who Have Weaponized Government for Political Gain","The current American administration has demonstrated a relentless campaign against anything they consider progressive or left-leaning. Through their attacks on Democrats, the weaponization of the DOJ, and even the reported revocation of security clearances for law firms representing figures like Jack Smith, they have set a dangerous precedent.

For years, Republicans have accused Democrats of “weaponizing government,” yet under this administration, we’ve seen an actual systematic effort to punish political opponents, undermine legal accountability, and shield powerful conservative figures from scrutiny. If Democrats regain control of the presidency, Senate, and House, they not only have the right but the duty to bring to account those who have engaged in corruption, abuse of power, and the dismantling of democratic norms.

This should not be done out of pure political retaliation but as a necessary step to uphold the rule of law. If individuals like Trump, his enablers in Congress, and powerful conservative figures like Elon Musk have engaged in unlawful activities, they should face real legal consequences.

1jg6hl8,CMV: Trump has literally become infallible and there is literally nothing can do that would cause him to lose support from his base and republicans,"At this point, there’s nothing Trump can do that would cause republicans and his base to stop supporting him. He has a cult of personality like Kim Jong Un, where the leader is always correct no matter what and everyone supports every decision he does. 

He was just sold innocent migrants into slavery in El Salvador. He is arbitrarily arresting green card for free speech. He is dismantling government departments without congressional approval. He is ignoring court orders. He is openly siding with Russia against Europe. He is tariffing and threatening to invade our allies. He is crashing the economy.

What could he do that would cause them to not support him? 

Here are some things that could happen but I can’t see anyone on the right caring about it:

If he arrested American citizens for free speech, they wouldn’t care. If he deported American citizens to El Salvador or gitmo without a trial, they wouldn’t care. If the economy collapsed 2008 style, they wouldn’t care. If he arrested judges who ruled against hum, they wouldn’t care. If he pulled out of NATO and allied with russia against europe, they wouldnt care. If he invaded canada, they woildnt care.

1j8ugsg,CMV: Anti Woke discourse is simply a euphemism for the eradication of civil rights.," It is not acceptable to say, “Black people are gaining too much social power and must be put back into their place.”

So they say, “Enough of this woke bullshit.”

It is no longer acceptable to say, “These LGBT+ individuals are ruining family values and must be eliminated.”

So they say, “The woke virus is infecting our children.”

It is less socially acceptable to say, “Women are destroying industry and must be forced into homemaking and child-rearing.”

So they say, “Woke feminism is destroying the women of America.”

Some argue that opposition to “wokeness” is simply about rejecting extremism. But in practice, anti-woke rhetoric overwhelmingly targets marginalized groups, civil rights progress, and efforts toward inclusion—not radical or fringe ideas. The radical/fringe ideas are used as justification for the elimination of rights across the board.

1jmkhau,CMV: Conservatives are fundamentally uninterested in facts/data.,"In fairness, I will admit that I am very far left, and likely have some level of bias, and I will admit the slight irony of basing this somewhat on my own personal anecdotes. However I do also believe this is supported by the trend of more highly educated people leaning more and more progressive.

However I always just assumed that conservatives simply didn't *know* the statistics, and that if they learned them they would change their opinion based on that new information. I have been proven wrong countless times however, both online, in person, while canvasing. It's not a matter of presenting data, neutral sources, meeting them in the middle. They either refuse to engage with things like studies and data completely, or they decide that because it doesn't agree with their intuition that it must be somehow ""fake"" or invalid. 

When I talk to these people and ask them to provide a source of their own, or what is informing their opinion, they either talk directly past it, or the conversation ends right there. I feel like if you're asked a follow up like ""Oh where did you get that number?"" and the conversation suddenly ends, it's just an admission that you're pulling it out of your ass, or you saw it online and have absolutely no clue where it came from or how legitimate it is. It's frustrating. 

I'm not saying there aren't progressives who have lost the plot and don't check their information, however I feel like it's championed among conservatives. Conservatives have pushed for decades at this point to destroy trust in any kind of academic institution, boiling them down to ""indoctrination centers."" They have to, because otherwise it looks glaring that the 5 highest educated states in the US are the most progressive and the 5 lowest are the most conservative, so their only option is to discredit academic integrity. 

I personally am wrong all the time, it's a natural part of life. If you can't remember the last time you were wrong, then you are simply ignorant to it.

1jj2z63,"CMV: Pete Hegseth is every bit as incompetent as people feared he would be, and should be investigated for violation of the Espionage Act. But he won't be.","As has been [recently](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/) [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/24/us/trump-news#hegseth-classified-war-plans-group-chat), Pete Hegseth recently texted the plans for an American strike in Yemen to a Signal group-chat that somehow included the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg. Doing his part for information security, Goldberg did not disclose that this had happened until after the strike had been carried out, and when he did, did not share the details of the plans.

Using a commercial messaging up to share sensitive information about American military operations is an enormous breach of information security, and, as many in the linked articles have opined, this kind of breach could have harmed the lives of American intelligence and military personnel.

Given the current state of the government, I imagine that Hegseth will walk away from this with little more than a slap on the wrist. But he should be investigated, and, if found in violation of the law, tried and sentenced for what is, at best, egregious carelessness toward those Americans whose lives depend on his leadership.

1j47t8d,CMV: The probability of Trump being a Russian agent is high enough to be taken very seriously,"First of all, there are multiple [accounts ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/29/trump-russia-asset-claims-former-kgb-spy-new-book)of people who had worked in Soviet intelligence during 80s stating that Trump was actively cultivated as an asset during that time. Trump [first visited](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842/) Russia in 1987, before it became significantly easier for westerners to enter it. At that time the people who were actually invited from West to USSR were diplomats, people important for business reasons (e.g. providing expertise for some factory USSR wanted to build), PR (leftist authors, children, etc.) or (potential) intelligence assets. The formal reason for Trump's visit - building a Trump tower next to Kremlin seems less than realistic, but it served as a passable cover story for intelligence use (at least when Trump attracted less attention). It should also be noted that at approximately same time, Australia [rejected ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/trumps-bid-for-sydney-casino-30-years-ago-rejected-due-to-mafia-connections)his bid to build a casino there due to his ""mafia connections"" - meaning Trump likely was already not law-abiding citizen back then.

  
So there is a lot of evidence that Russia tried to recruit Trump. Given that Russia [provided him a lot of money](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/) later on, after Trump ran his earlier business into ground, it seems likely that the recruitment was successful

  
Once recruited he would be on the hook permanently. While as US president Trump would have enough of his own leverage to not be forced to automatically do everything Russia asked, Russia could cause him enough problems that they would be able to ""request"" him to perform services every now and then. It can also be noted that once it was pretty much certain that Trump was leaving White House, his counterleverage on Russia would be gone, and he could be forced into extra services - like, say, providing Russia with confidential documents, and every service provided to Russia would make it harder to extricate himself (as such arrangements usually work).

  
Similarly, once Trump won the election again, Russia would be VERY insistent that Trump do something about US support for Ukraine (at least once Trump got his most immediate priorities in order). However even among republicans there would be quite a significant number that would have issues with simply announcing the end of support to Ukraine. So a show would be needed to sell this idea. You may note how during Zelensky's visit to White House Vance did multiple attacks on Zelensky that he would have never dared without prior Trump's approval (if your boss invites someone for supposedly important deal, you don't just start attacking them out of the blue). So Trump and Vance discussed this in advance and the plan was to try to provoke Zelensky. This seems rather strange is Trump's actual priority was really the minerals. However it makes sense if Trump would prefer to look like a person who cared about US economic interests, while getting pretext to end support for Ukraine for reasons which at first glance involved mainly other people. That said, in that case even if Zelensky jumped through all the hoops and the deal did not fall apart, that could be made to work to both Russia and Trump's benefit, just slower. Trump would tout getting control over some of Ukraine's resources, Ukrainian (and European) economic situation would weaken, while Trump could a few months later find a myriad reasons why Ukraine was doing something wrong and the support had to be reduced/withheld anyway (it's not like Trump's supporters would care about his lack of consistency).



Now, there's a lot of various facts pointing to Trump having been recruited by Russia decades ago, and Russia probably still having sufficient leverage over him. It does not however amount to a smoking gun. You could argue however that with the current circumstantial evidence it looks sufficiently probable to become a significant factor in analysis and prediction of Trump's actions, and for the people with a stake in US politics to care about. To make an analogy, consider a person whose 3 previous spouses died under suspicious circumstances with that person inheriting money from each. It does not quite amount to proof of guilt, but it could be a sufficient reason for law enforcement to investigate this deeper, and if you or someone close to you was planning to become that person's 4th spouse, it would be quite reasonable to seriously take that past pattern into account, take significant precautions, and be alert for further pieces that would support that.

  
On the subject of investigations - the obvious question would be that Trump would be investigated under Biden for such links. The problem is that if Trump were to be accused, he'd immediately declare it a witch hunt, and when Trump had support of half the country, anything short of a smoking gun proof would be ignored by his supporters, and an attempt to arrest Trump could trigger a civil war. And even for a serious investigation it may be difficult to come up with smoking gun - even if e.g. decrypted text logs of Trump's communication with his handlers were produced, Trump would just declare them to be fake, and his supporters would not give it a second thought - which could have easily strengthened Trump's position at election by giving him a martyr card if the accusation was pressed - so it's quite probable that in such scenario Biden would choose to not rock the boat and hope that Trump would just not be able to win again.",Ancquar,7146,803,0.9100000262260436,0.6231817953718892,1741194021,/r/changemyview/comments/1j47t8d/cmv_the_probability_of_trump_being_a_russian/,2025,3,changemyview,2025-03-05 17:00:21
1j49p5o,CMV: MAGA Is A True Fascist Movement,"I'm using R. Griffin's definition palingenetic ultra-nationalism, or true fascism, to identify MAGA.

The two components of this ideology is the palingenetic *myth* and populist *ultra-nationalism.*

Definitions:

Palingenetic myth: “a generic term for the vision of a radically *new* beginning which follows a period of destruction or perceived dissolution.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 33)

“At the heart of the palingenetic political myth lies the belief that contemporaries are living through or about to live through a 'sea-change', a 'water-shed' or 'turning-point' in the historical process. The perceived corruption, anarchy, oppressiveness, iniquities or decadence of the present, rather than being seen as immutable and thus to be endured indefinitely with stoic courage or bleak pessimism, are perceived as having reached their peak and interpreted as the sure sign that one era is nearing its end and a new order is about to emerge.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 35)

Populist: “a generic term for political forces which, even if led by a small elite cadres or self-appointed 'vanguard', in practice or in principle (and not merely for show) depend on 'people power' as the basis for legitimacy.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 36-37)

Ultra-nationalism: “forms of nationalism which 'go beyond', and hence reject, anything compatible with liberal institutions or with the tradition of Enlightenment humanism which underpins it.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 37)

“Populist ultra-nationalism rejects the principles both of absolutism and of pluralist representative government. ... it thus repudiates both 'traditional' and 'legal/rational' forms of politics in favour of prevalently 'charismatic' ones in which the cohesion and dynamics of movements depends almost exclusively on the capacity of their leaders to inspire loyalty and action.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 37)

Palingenetic ultra-nationalism: “a genus of political energy... whose mobilizing vision is that of *the national community rising phoenix-like after a period of encroaching decadence which all but destroyed it*.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 38)

In short, this is the *fascist minimum*, palingenetic ultra-nationalism, MAGA.

Applying the definitions to Trump and MAGA:

The Make America Great Again slogan conjures the palingenetic myth. His rhetoric of empty promises of America's new Golden Age (only for the billionaires), and constant blaming of the 'deep state', immigrants, cultural Marxists, liberals, 'unhumans' and so on and so forth hindering their march into a fairy-tale future. These groups are identified as the *existing order* that caused America to become corrupt and decadent, that the system needs overthrown so a new utopian Golden Age can begin.

“Yet the predominance of the utopian component... also has two important practical consequences which several *limit* its effectiveness as a political force. First, the core myth of palingenetic ultra-nationalism is susceptible to so many nuances of interpretation in terms of specific 'surface' ideas and policies that... it tends to generate a wide range of competing currents and factions even within the same political culture...” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 39)

Currently, there are three main factions within the MAGA party.

1. The Dark Enlightenment oligarchs, whose palingenetic myth entails the ascendance of a *patchwork* of techno-monarchy city-states out of the destruction of civilization they create. One of the founders of the Dark Enlightenment philosophy, Curtis Yarvin, is also the architect of the butterfly revolution and designed the blueprints for DOGE's RAGE.

1. The Christian Nationalists, with their dream of cleansing the nation of all the sinful and decadent liberals, merging church and state to form a Christian nation or 'heaven on Earth' out of the rubble. This is the goal of Project 2025.
2. The MAGA Ultra-nationalists, whose visions have never been truly articulated other than 'bringing back' some Golden Age I can only assume some version of a nostalgic fairy-tale society that was only ever depicted in 1950s advertisements.

It is important to note that all these factions share some version of the palingenetic myth. They are all working together to achieve the destruction of the current order, the toppling of America's constitutional republic. They differ on what comes after the destruction, and have no real idea what it will be, like the dog who finally catches up to the car.

There can never been a light at the end of the tunnel for Trump and MAGA, the Golden Age will eternally be just beyond the horizon. They will have to endlessly create new 'enemies from within' and without preventing them from achieving their promised utopia. It will not end with rounding up all the immigrants or conquering Greenland and Canada, there will always be new enemies in their eternal struggle for 'MAGA'.

“Second, it means that fascism is in its element as an oppositional ideology only as long as the climate of national crisis prevails... it can only maintain its momentum and cohesion by continually precipitating events which seemed to fulfil the promise of permanent revolution, of continuing palingenesis.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 40)

“In a grotesque travesty of Faustian restlessness, fascism cannot permit itself to linger on a bed of contentment: its arch-enemy is the 'normality' of human society in equilibrium, its Achilles heel as a form of practical politics the utopianism which the fear of this enemy breeds.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 40)

“Without precise objectives the fascist must move forward all the time, but just because precise objectives are lacking he can never stop, and every goal attained is a stage on the continuous treadmill of the future he claims to construct, of the national destiny he claims to fulfil. Fascist dynamism comes at the price of this, and therein lies its profound revolutionary nature, but also it seems the seeds of its eventual fall.” (E. Weber, 1964, p 78)

I think everyone, even the most mindless of Trump's followers, can agree that Trump is a populist. He has mastered the art of demagoguery, every lie that spews out of his mouth resonates with his base.

“Admittedly, the concept of the organic national community connotes classlessness, unfettered social mobility and an abolition of the inequities of *laissez-faire* capitalism in a way which allowed some of its ideologues to claim to represent 'true' democracy. Yet power in the new community would remain descending rather than ascending even after the rebirth (in any case an ongoing process) had been inaugurated in a new order, for it would be concentrated in the hands of those who had risen 'naturally' through the ranks of the various hierarchical organizations in which all the political, economic and cultural energies of the nation were to be channelled and orchestrated. In a mystic version of direct democracy, the representation of the people's general will in a fascist society would mean entrusting authority to an elite or (especially in its inter-war versions) a leader whose mission it is to safeguard the supra-individual interests and destiny of the people to whom it (or he) claims to be linked by a metaphysical bond of a common nationhood. A paradox thus lies at the heart of fascist ultra-nationalism. It is populist in intent and rhetoric, yet elitist in practice.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 41)

This elitist form of populism, this top-down hierarchical structure, means the *charismatic leader* decides what the 'will of the people' is, which then flows down to 'the people'. The movements gains its power through the leader. Was MAGA calling for the invasion of Greenland, or was Trump (at the request of the Dark Enlightenment oligarch Dryden Brown)? How about tariffs to impoverish everyday Americans, is that the 'will of the people'?

“The most obvious symptom of the reliance of both on charismatic power is, of course, the leader cult, which in both regimes \[a reference to Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy\] became increasingly important to paper over the widening cracks between propaganda and reality. ...However, the very success of an individual in becoming the charismatic leader of a fascist movement, and even mounting an assault on state power, is also its Achille's heel. In the long run the law of entropy which applies to the innovatory or expansionist momentum of a regime will also affect the leader himself. It will do so inexorably and in a way which the most efficient propaganda machine in the world cannot conceal indefinitely: he will grow infirm and eventually die.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 42)

MAGA contain all essential ingredients of palingenetic ultra-nationalism (true fascism).

As long as this idea is out in the public ethos, former president Obama should have his hat in the ring for three major reasons:



1) It compels the traditional checks on power (the Supreme Court) to issue a ruling on this matter. If they rule that Trump \*can\* seek a third term while Obama cannot, that decision would be ""settled"" rather than hypothetical.

  
2) Obama's presidency left much to be desired, but he is by far the most electorally successful candidate the democrats have run since 2000. Even with a healthy dose of voter suppression, I'd like his chances against Donny.

  
3) I'm not calling for the end of rules and decorum, but abusing the ""norms"" has become a popular, even politically successful strategy. We must focus on moving the country in a positive direction; getting Obama out on the campaign trail could represent that desire, and would also be a significant departure from the norms observed by the democratic parts (which is why this is very unlikely to actually happen).",iAINTaTAXI,5827,749,0.8799999952316284,0.5343706717381459,1743443784,/r/changemyview/comments/1jo9hw8/cmv_obama_needs_to_hit_the_campaign_trail_until/,2025,3,changemyview,2025-03-31 17:56:24
1jlfocq,CMV: It’s bad that the state department revoked the visa of a Rumeysa Ozturk without providing any evidence of wrongdoing,"On Tuesday evening, a Tufts graduate student was detained by ICE in Somerville, MA. The student had a valid student visa but it was revoked on Tuesday. The department of homeland security claimed that the student supported Hamas and for that reason her visa was revoked. No details or evidence was provided to support that claim.

The student has not been charged with any crime. The only two actions news outlets have identified that the student took related to the Hamas-Israel war were to publish an article and help organize a potluck to support Palestinian students. The article was published in the student newspaper and argued that Tufts University should follow the recommendations of the student union resolution to boycott Sabra, divesting from Israeli companies, and condemn the genocide of Palestinians.

I think it’s wrong that a student would have their visa revoked and then be detained in a prison in Louisiana without any evidence of wrongdoing being presented.

The Arab world is the laughing stock of the world, nobody take us seriously or want Arab immigrants in their countries, why should they? Out of 22 Arab countries, 10 are failed states, 5 are stable but poor and has authoritarian regimes, 6 are rich, but with theocratic monarchies where slavery is still practiced. The only democracy with decent human rights in the Arab world is Tunisia who's poor and last year they have elected a dictator wannabe. 


And the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq are just embarrassing, Arabs are killing eachother over something that happened 1400 years ago (battle of Karabala) while we are seeing the west trying to get colonize mars. 


I don't think Arabs are capable to make a developed democratic state that doesn't violate human rights, its either secular dictatorship or Islamic dictatorship. When the Arabs have a democracy they always vote for an Islamic dictatorship instead like what happened in Palestine, Iraq, Egypt and Tunisia.

Now when a normal democrat voter or a centrist who leans democrat sees that their car that they got to prevent climate change got burned down. They can wind up being radicalized into thinking that the democrats are completely insane and can’t be trusted. Most people don’t actively care about politics until it affects them and having your car burnt down will make it affect you. This can lead into even more radical thinking like someone supporting turning burning teslas into domestic terrorism because “my car got burnt down they cost me a lot of money fuck them” ways of thinking. 

As far as violent conservative backlash goes I don’t think I need to go to deep into this one and the likely hood it will happen. What I will say is consider who will get caught in the crossfire because it won’t be the arsonists because they can’t catch them but it will be something they consider leftist whatever that maybe.

*they believe they understand climate change better than geologists, archeologists, and meteorologists

*they believe they understand carbon dating better than archeologists

*they believe they understand vaccines and infectious diseases better than doctors and medical researches who have dedicated their life’s work to the subjects

*they believe they understand inflation and tariffs better than economists

*they believe they understand the motivations of Putin better than the CIA, who spends $70 billion per year gathering intel (along with the intelligence agencies of the entire western world)

1jmlvp4,CMV: it is disrespectful and disingenuous to not make the distinction between legal and illegal immigrants.,"I’m a Chinese Canadian that immigrated legally with my family, so my view is definitely influenced by this experience.

When I look at online and real life discussions of Trump’s deportation plans and border issues and similar, more often than not, people participating in the discussion omit the word “illegal” when in fact, they are talking about illegal immigration. 

This feels highly disingenuous, as the purposeful removal of the word “illegal” seems to be whitewashing, or muddying the illegality, of border crossing or overstaying. I think it is intentionally misleading when people say “migrants” or “immigrants”, when in reality they are referring to undocumented migrants.

It is also very much disrespectful to those to worked hard, studied English, passed exams, took a risk for their children, all while respecting the law, to lump them together with illegal immigrants. Asking questions like “why do you hate immigrants?” is disingenuous, useless, and straight up disrespectful. This type of ambiguity hinders a genuine discussion, because the people who refuse to make the distinction are intentionally watering down the obvious illegality of illegal immigration.

The only exception that I can understand is if your moral/political beliefs involve the right of migration and dismantling of international borders, which by definition eliminates the need to make the distinction of the legality of the migrants.

My argument is that, if you want a discussion that is genuine and respectful, you must specify the type of immigration in question.",IncidentHead8129,1115,710,0.8100000023841858,0.2599256075956633,1743253616,/r/changemyview/comments/1jmlvp4/cmv_it_is_disrespectful_and_disingenuous_to_not/,2025,3,changemyview,2025-03-29 13:06:56

Arabic and Arabs were a small minority outside the Arabian peninsula and none existent in north Africa, after Islamization they ""magically"" became overwhelmingly represented in the MENA region.

Source: https://ibb.co/DHrJh2RF




- Islam request Arabic
Islam forces its followers to pray and read Quran in Arabic compare to Christianity where you read the Bible and pray in your native language, Arabic is also the language of heavens in Islam, you need to say the shahada in Arabic to covert to Islam and even adhan (call for pray) is also required to be Arabic. Non-Arab Muslims uses Arabic terms like Inshallah, subhanallah, astaghfirallah and etc. 


-You need to be a descendants of Qurayshi Arabs to be a Caliphate

Many sunni hadiths have emphasized the Caliphate need to be descendants of Qurayshi (Muhammed's tribe for those who don't know) which's why a lot of Muslims don't consider non-Arab caliphates like ottomans to be a legit caliphate and anti-ottoman Arabs have used the fact they aren't Quaryashi to delegitmize them as true Caliphate, and there's many non-Arab Muslim rulers like Saladdin who fit all requirements of being a Caliphate except the fact that he was a Kurdish instead of being a Qurayshi Arab. 


- Islam is heavily Arab centric 

You required to do pilgrimage to two cities in Arabia as a Muslim, you idolize Arab figures like Omar, Abu bakr, Othman and Ali and Islam tells you to be live and act like prophet Muhammed (an Arab man), you follow an Arabic calender system, you required pray towards Mecca, non-Arab Muslims wear Arabic clothes like hijab, abya and thawb and non-Arab Muslims give their children Arabic names while non-Arabic names are looked down on.

1j9342a,CMV: MAGA loves ‘Free Speech’ until the speaker Is brown.,"
Mahmoud Khalil was arrested in the middle of the night. No charges. No trial. No warrant. ICE agents dragged a lawful permanent resident out of his home in front of his pregnant wife and locked him in a Louisiana detention center, 1,300 miles away. He is a husband, a researcher, a recent graduate with a master’s degree… But he is also Palestinian. And he protested. He’s not a criminal. He’s not a terrorist. He legally  protested… 

No one voted for this. No one passed a law saying ICE can disappear people for having the wrong opinions. No one decided protesting was a crime. But somehow, Trump did. He went online after the arrest, called Khalil a “Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student,” and made sure everyone knew: “The first arrest of many to come.”

That should piss off anyone who believes in freedom.

The government now has the power to grab any legal resident and call them a national security threat… without proof, without a trial, without due process. If you think that power stays aimed at people you don’t like, you haven’t been paying attention.

A Chinese PhD student at UC Berkeley was arrested last week for attending a pro-Palestinian protest. No criminal act, no violence, just speech. Trump is already talking about stripping citizenship from people he deems “un-American.” He’s promising mass deportations, mass arrests, mass punishment for people who speak out against him.

What exactly does “the first of many” mean? Who else is on that list?

It’s funny how the same people who screamed about weaponized government, who swore the deep state was coming for them, who chanted “Free Speech!” every time someone got banned from Twitter, are now completely fine with ICE detaining people over their political views. The ones who said the Second Amendment exists to resist tyranny now shrug when the First is trampled.

Maybe it’s different when it’s someone else’s rights being erased. Maybe the Constitution only matters when it’s your speech on the line. But that’s not how freedom works. If the government can disappear one legal resident without charges, they can do it to anyone.

If that doesn’t bother you, just say you never cared about liberty in the first place.

1j8csfy,"CMV: The President of China (Xi Jinping) is now the most powerful person on Earth, not the president of America.","We were living in an American Century. Since World War 2, the President of the United States has been considered the most powerful person in the world. However, I believe that title now belongs to Xi Jinping, and not to Donald Trump (or any US president). 

China's economy cannot be understated. It has been the world's largest economy (PPP) for over a decade now. The country is a manufacturing giant, controls massive amounts of global supply chains, and has significant leverage over international trade. Not to mention it has 1.4 billion people to serve as its workforce, consumer base, and anything else the CCP needs.

The US, once the uncontested global leader, is in a state of deep political division, economic struggles, and social unrest. Partisan infighting, government gridlock, and internal strife make it harder for any president—especially Trump—to wield power effectively. The US’s global influence has also been waning as China expands its reach through its growing Belt and Road Empire.

The most significant factor is the difference in governance. The US president operates within a democratic system that imposes limits on power—courts, Congress, elections, media scrutiny, and public opinion all act as constraints. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping is an authoritarian leader who has effectively consolidated power, removed term limits, cracked down on dissent, and expanded surveillance and social control. In other words, he can dictate policies with little resistance, while a US president is constantly facing checks and opposition (despite what Trump and DOGE are trying).

China is making strategic moves to replace the US as the dominant global force. It is investing in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, gaining influence in regions the US has neglected. It is also developing economic alliances that reduce reliance on the dollar and expanding military capabilities, particularly in the South China Sea.

Putin might have been sabotaging America, but China is the real winner of America's repeated own goals. The USA still has massive soft power, but who knows how much longer that will last considering divisions and the current administration. The world order is shifting, and it’s time to acknowledge that the most powerful person on Earth might no longer be sitting in the White House.

1j7926t,CMV: MAGA only cares about veterans when it’s campaign season,"The same maga peeps who chant “support the troops” at rallies don’t seem to care much once those troops come home. 80,000 VA jobs are on the chopping block, and somehow the “most pro-military president ever” thinks gutting healthcare and services is a good way to honor veterans.

Veteran homelessness? Still a crisis. Veteran suicides? Still happening at ~17 per day. The VA budget? Shrinking… unless you count the part that gets funneled to private contractors. Meanwhile, defense spending stays sky-high because supporting the military only counts when there’s a war to fight.

Trump called fallen soldiers suckers and losers, but the people who claim to love veterans just shrugged. Which really confuses me but…When military leadership wouldn’t bend the knee, he purged them.

1jmz7ac,CMV: damaging Tesla cars that are owned by individuals to protest the company makes no sense,"Tesla, and Elon Musk in particular, have been very prominent ever since he became a major part of the US government. I was especially affected by this shift, as someone who combines multiple nationalities and ideologies that Musk openly despises - so to set things straight, I'm very supportive of protests against Musk and his companies. I'm also not here to argue about the effectiveness of violence or property damage as a means of protesting - for the sake of argument, just assume that it can be very effective. I'm talking about specifically damaging individual, random Tesla cars, because the attitude towards doing that has become kind of psychotic recently. Not just on the hardcore dedicated subreddits (Cyberstuck and whatnot), but city subreddits or default subs - nearly everyone seems to agree over this nowadays. There's little to no nuance when people discuss this.

My point here is that damaging Teslas that have already been purchased hurts a random person and does absolutely nothing to the Tesla company. The company has already received its money for the car, and they really don't care if you use it or drive it off a cliff straight off the lot. In fact, partially damaging them actually benefits Tesla, because Tesla makes good money by selling replacement parts and repair services. I'll address a few very common responses that I've seen floating around.

**Random people are an acceptable loss because this protesting makes people scared of buying Teslas**: I disagree with both parts. For one, I don't think that this is an acceptable loss - for many people (and young people especially), a car is often the most expensive asset one owns. Despite the way people characterize it, Teslas aren't only owned by the ultra-rich - both because many US residents are happy to take on boatloads of debt for a nicer car, and because used Teslas aren't actually that expensive. For these groups, destroying or damaging their car is life-ruining. For two, I don't think that the effectiveness of ""making people scared"" is justified. Anyone who wants to buy a Tesla *now*, while all this is happening, has already taken on an ideological position and is okay with that risk. A person who already likes Elon Musk won't be bothered by this.

**Tesla owners are mostly Elon lovers and/or far-rightists and they deserve it**: the way how people handled the Elon sentiment shift from Reddit's favorite billionaire to what he is now has been really jarring, because so many people are now claiming they 'always knew', and so did everybody else. I don't think there's this many fortune tellers among us - Musk has pivoted very strongly after COVID. He has had his asshole moments and incidents before, but there really was nothing that'd set him far apart from your average billionaire or car company owner. No, he really has gone off the deep end. Whatever he was doing in the past is comparable to now, and even if someone personally disliked him in the 2010s, many still ended up buying Teslas because they're electric and because they didn't have good competition in the EV sector for a pretty long time. You can maybe place some of that ideological fault on anyone who bought a (new) car in the last few years, but not even Cybertruck owners fully fall into that group - since that car has been delayed many times, it means that its first owners were pre-ordering them in 2019. So no, most people didn't always know, nor do most of them support what has become of Elon's companies today.

**They should just sell their car**: this is the worst non-answer of them all, because it's only talking about solving someone's personal issue, not forming a coherent argument for why they should do it. So, say someone sells their Tesla because they're afraid of vandalism. Now, does the new owner of this used car deserve all the 'punishment'? How can you ideologically profile someone based on car ownership? How would you know if someone's car is brand new or used? Also, why should these current owners be liable to take a huge financial hit that comes from selling a used car, buying/fixing/insuring a replacement car, spending days doing all of that? It makes no sense.

I think this should cover most of it. I think that vandalizing/damaging/destroying cars that have already been bought is pretty horrible, *and* also ineffective as a form of protest. I also think that this is a huge distraction that refocuses ideological Americans towards infighting rather than effective protesting. The lack of a centralized protest movement in the US is pretty obvious, and much fewer people are willing to do the same vandalism to Tesla plants or dealerships, because they have the money and power to bring about consequences and retribution. The random, relatively powerless stranger whose Tesla's tires got slashed can't do that, so that's what people are focusing on.",noljo,430,721,0.6700000166893005,0.224666729674143,1743290772,/r/changemyview/comments/1jmz7ac/cmv_damaging_tesla_cars_that_are_owned_by/,2025,3,changemyview,2025-03-29 23:26:12

However, nobody questions this or cares. But if a religion was to say ""being black is wrong"" or ""being asian is wrong"" everyone would be FURIOUS regardless of if it's normalized because of religion.

1jj100l,CMV: Elon Musk IS Elizabeth Holmes. He just hasn't crashed out yet.,"Elon and Elizabeth suffer from symptoms of the same psychology. The internal dialog goes something like: ""I've become a billionaire; therefore, I must possess an unquantifiable genius that the rest of the population lacks. My bank account proves it."" They become drunk on the myth of their own genius. 

They never stop to ask themselves tough and reflective questions like, ""Was I just lucky?"" or ""Am I the beneficiary of a perfectly-timed investment and shifting industry?"" 

Elon is a classic case of a rich kid who had access to capital just as the US tech industry was exploding. He made some great investments, sure. But for every guy like Elon who made it, there are hundreds of others who may be smarter but simply weren't as lucky. They've now lost everything, where Elon has survived. Statistically, there will always be some lucky survivors; they aren't geniuses. 

Now that Elon's personal brand is imploding, he is again looking to external causes rather than asking himself the tough and reflective question: ""Did my behavior cause this?"" 

For both Elon and Elizabeth they've vastly overplayed their hands with this 'heads I win, tails you lose' thinking. In business school, I recall this being called an ""attribution error."" Executives tend to credit their quick thinking when the company succeeds but blame the 'economy' when it fails. ""It can never be me.""

So, Elon's crash is coming. It will be bigger than Elizabeth Holmes.' The video clip of him gleefully wielding a chainsaw as he simulates cutting family-supporting federal jobs will one day be the cover art on the tell-all documentary.

1jiv455,CMV: The Gaza war persists due to Hamas' refusal to surrender which is rooted in their religious ideology,"The ongoing Israel-Gaza war persists because Hamas refuses to surrender, despite having no realistic chance of military victory. Israel's overwhelming military advantage has inflicted heavy losses on Hamas fighters and infrastructure and it is only getting worse. And rather than capitulating when faced with destruction, as is typically the case in military conflict, Hamas continues to fight, prolonging the war and exacerbating suffering for civilians in Gaza.

What many in the West seem to forget - or are perhaps unaware of - is that Hamas is operating with an extremist religious ideology that views martyrdom as preferable to humiliation in defeat. 

It's why Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida said ""You love life the way we love death."" 

It's why top Hamas leader Khaled Mashal said that 2 million dead Palestinians is worth it for the liberation of the entire land. Sadly, people seem to lack even a basic understanding of Hamas' worldview and how little they care for the lives of their own people.

Hamas' radical interpretation of Islam glorifies dying in battle as an act of faith and resistance. This belief system abhors surrender as the ultimate defeat, betrayal, and humiliation, even if a diplomatic solution would protect Palestinian lives and put an end to the bloodshed. Because of this, Hamas isn't operating by the same logic we saw with the Germans and Japanese in WW2 where military defeat leads to surrender and peace. Hamas' ideology, and its commitment to endless resistance explains why they prioritize symbolic acts of defiance over pragmatic goals.

People understandably want an end to war, and yet calls for Hamas to surrender are nowhere to be found. The idea that Hamas can remain in power is untenable to anyone actually familiar with Hamas' long history of brutality and what the group stands for.

In light of all of the above, it's no surprise that Hamas refuses to surrender, and why all of their stipulations to hand back the hostages come with bizarre conditions that would allow them to claim at least an illusion of victory, even in the face of devastating losses. Their entire belief system emphasizes struggle over compromise and an admission of loss, which only reinforces the idea that surrender is not an option, regardless of the cost to Gaza’s population.

Unlike conflicts where one side concedes after suffering overwhelming losses, Hamas sees perpetual struggle as an inherent duty. The end result is that you have Israel trying to get its hostages back and Hamas willing to sacrafice every Palestinian rather than surrender. It's a death cult mentality that is apparent to anyone willing to look at Hamas with objective eyes.",thatshirtman,0,778,0.4900000095367431,0.216471897607123,1742834300,/r/changemyview/comments/1jiv455/cmv_the_gaza_war_persists_due_to_hamas_refusal_to/,2025,3,changemyview,2025-03-24 16:38:20
1j2ip0y,CMV: Germany’s Mainstream Parties Need to Take a Harder Stance on Immigration or Risk Losing to the Far Right,"The AfD’s surge in popularity isn’t some random political phenomenon, it’s the direct result of mainstream parties failing to address immigration concerns in a way that resonates with the public. Whether you love or hate the AfD, you can’t deny that they’ve capitalized on an issue that clearly matters to a large portion of Germans. The rise in terror attacks, violent crimes, and societal tensions linked (rightly or wrongly) to immigration has created a climate of fear and frustration. The scale of the issue is debatable, but at this point, news of another car plowing through a crowd or a knife attack in a train station barely raises an eyebrow, it’s become disturbingly routine.

This is where Germany’s mainstream parties have failed. By refusing to take a strong, clear stance on immigration, they’ve essentially handed the AfD a political goldmine. Some AfD voters are undoubtedly far right or racist, but many are supporting the party because it’s the only one willing to bluntly say, “We have a problem.” The rest tiptoe around the issue with vague promises, fear of being labeled xenophobic, or an insistence that it’s not *really* a problem. But when the public sees real world consequences (whether it’s crime, economic strain, or cultural clashes) no amount of hand waving will convince them otherwise.

We’ve already seen what happens when far right parties gain real power. Historically, it never ends well. But ignoring the issue won’t make it go away. If the mainstream political spectrum continues to downplay immigration concerns, the AfD will only grow stronger. Most of them don’t vote for the far right because they’re eager for extremism, they vote for it when they feel like there’s no other option. If Germany’s major parties want to stop the AfD’s momentum, they need to stop treating immigration as a taboo topic and start addressing it with the same directness and urgency. Otherwise, they’re just ceding ground to the very movement they claim to oppose.",Empty_Alternative859,419,689,0.7099999785423279,0.2151476510476611,1741008642,/r/changemyview/comments/1j2ip0y/cmv_germanys_mainstream_parties_need_to_take_a/,2025,3,changemyview,2025-03-03 13:30:42

1j42itp,CMV: Trump administration has almost no chance of achieving peace in Ukraine with their approach,"So far, Trump admin was taking away things from Ukrainians (supplies, intelligence, diplomatic support, chance of security guarantees and possibly sanctions on Russia), while taking basically nothing from Russia. 

This had two effects. 

First of all the Trump admin threw away most of the leverage it had over Ukraine. Like what more can they do to harm their position? Give weapons to Russia? That is very unlikely to happen. Ukrainians have little reason to care about Trump's opinion at this point. 

Second of all, Putin has now little reason to stop. While the lack of US aid will not be felt immediately, it will worsen the Ukrainian position in the long term. Why would Putin stop, when he is gaining territory? Especially considering that the Russian war economy runs very hot and is likely to take a massive, massive hit if all the weapons production was to stop. He can now realistically hope that a few more years can give him cities like Kharkiv, which he almost held and then lost.

1jixfpg,CMV: Women’s social expectations can harm young men too,"I’ve seen a lot of discussion about how men can be entitled in dating, friendships, and emotional expression. But I rarely see conversations about how certain behaviors and expectations from women can also be harmful to young men.

For example, men are constantly told that it’s their job to initiate relationships, approach, plan, lead. But when they struggle with this and express frustration, they’re often dismissed as ""entitled"" or told to just ""try harder."" Meanwhile, many women still expect to be courted without taking on any of that effort themselves. Isn’t that also a form of entitlement?

There’s also the assumption that men only pursue relationships for sex. Personally, I (and a lot of other guys) crave emotional connection, someone to actually listen, care, and make us feel safe. Yes, sex is a factor, but acting like it’s all men want is just as reductive as saying all women are only after money. At its worst, this mindset leads to manipulation, where sex is used as a tool for control or where men’s emotional needs are completely ignored.

Another thing I’ve noticed is how socially awkward or quiet guys are sometimes treated. Some conventionally attractive women will go out of their way to talk to ""awkward"" guys, but it doesn’t always feel like genuine interest. It can feel performative, like a self-esteem boost or a way to look good in front of others. And if a quiet guy just keeps to himself, he risks being labeled a ""creep"" or even an ""incel"" for simply existing in the wrong space. This makes it even harder for shy or socially anxious guys to feel comfortable around women.

Then there’s the way women can bully men, which doesn’t get talked about much. Fake asking someone out as a joke, spreading damaging rumors, or socially isolating them, these things happen, and they can really mess with a guy’s confidence. I’ve personally overheard women talking behind their friends' backs way more often than I ever have in male friend groups, yet social aggression is usually framed as a ""male"" problem.

And what about the expectation that men should have the same level of emotional intelligence as women? Many guys struggle with recognizing or expressing emotions, not because they don’t care, but because they weren’t taught how. Some only develop these skills in therapy, which costs time and money. But if a guy struggles emotionally, he’s often told to ""just communicate better"" while being judged for not already having the ability to navigate feelings like a seasoned pro. If emotional intelligence is something that has to be learned, does that mean men are expected to pay a financial cost just to be considered relationship material?

When you put all of this together, it’s not surprising that so many young men feel lost. They’re struggling in school, falling behind in college enrollment, and still expected to be financially successful while receiving less and less support. Meanwhile, many women still prefer partners who are high-earning and emotionally mature but don’t always acknowledge the barriers that men face in getting there.

I’m not saying all women behave this way, and I’m not excusing harmful male behavior either. I just think some of these issues go ignored, and they contribute to why so many young men feel disconnected and frustrated.",Short-Ad-4717,319,653,0.7200000286102295,0.199536863918669,1742839759,/r/changemyview/comments/1jixfpg/cmv_womens_social_expectations_can_harm_young_men/,2025,3,changemyview,2025-03-24 18:09:19
1jd0qnd,CMV: American Conservatives are hypocrites when it comes to Israel,"The vision of plaeo, or neo neoconservatism (purely secular here) that is being propagated by current US conservatives has espoused less foreign entanglement, less immigration or cultural exchange, less global involvement or a pay to play model (no commitments but either getting paid for services or outright submission) even to strong traditional allies and trade partners, from Canada to the EU to Japan and Korea to the great pulling of the rug in Ukraine, until you meet Israel.

Then that conservative view goes head over heels in Israeli appeasement... from endless support to taking Gaza off Israel's hands so the US can take the blame for it, to going back to the Middle East (foregoing South China Sea and Eastern Europe) to bomb more Yemenis in the mountains. 

The thing is it's predictable, and easy to plan around.. I don't think Hamas pulling off Oct 7 at that time was an accident.. their leaders had contact with Moscow, it was to take the heat off Russia and destroy any moral high ground the West had. 

It's an easy reliable bet on the US support to Israel being blind, unconditional and devotional, even if it's against US interests, destroys soft power and moral standing and makes most of the Muslim world ~22% of the planet, most of the global south as potential enemies. 

That's it, if you're a conservative in the mold of how Washington envisioned no foreign entanglement, explain how it's consistent with your views.

They want to destroy the system and be in power for as long as they possibly can. Voting rights and many other things are a direct threat to their ability to remain in power and shape society to their views. Of course they will try to manipulate and remove voting rights from as many of the ""wrong people"" as they can.

They do not care about laws. Every branch of government has already been complicit in the whole sale violation of law at every level. There is some resistance but it's barely slowing them down. Even if a judge or banding together of workers mitigates the capabilities of this administration in one area they will just come from ten other directions with the same intent and ambition.

1jjsvgx,CMV: I don't believe the Signal leak was an accident.,"When this story first came out, I bought the narrative that it was a blunder, but the more I read about it that theory doesn't make sense to me anymore.

The problem is not that I don't think they're incompetent enough to do it, but rather who it was that was added and when.  Michael Waltz added Jeffrey Goldberg as a connection two days before adding him to this small group, it was their first communication.  That first connection invite had to be established before he could be added to the group.  

If someone was going to leak a national security story, Jeffrey Goldberg is on a very short list of national security reporters with the experience, credibility, and platform who could be trusted to get this story out without compromising the operation or American intelligence methods.

So in order to believe this was a mistake we have to accept that someone made a new connection with this very specific person two days before the working group began and then accidentally added them to a conversation that pertains to their beat as a journalist.  

I can see accidentally adding someone to a chat, but it seems too great a coincidence that it was this particular person added just two days after a connection was first made.  

So if not a mistake, then what.

1. It's an intentional leak by the Trump team, possibly to put pressure on Europe, score some political point, or accomplish some interpersonal court politics type hit on someone you don't like.  This is possible, but it seems unlikely they would put themselves through this level of embarrassment and blowback when the same ends could've been accomplished in other ways.

2.  It's a whistleblower.  Possibly not even about the strike on the Houthis, but someone concerned that these conversations are happening on Signal at all.  Besides the obvious security concerns, what may be more consequential is that these conversations aren't be recorded and thus can't be FOIA'd.  If high-level discussions are consistently occurring over Signal it may be a strategy to get around the Presidential Records Act and shield themselves from legal scrutiny. 

Option 2 seems the most likely to me right now, but I admit it might be overly optimistic to believe there's a person willing to fall on the sword for the greater good in that room.",MattVideoHD,1923,295,0.9100000262260436,0.1896556479540688,1742933164,/r/changemyview/comments/1jjsvgx/cmv_i_dont_believe_the_signal_leak_was_an_accident/,2025,3,changemyview,2025-03-25 20:06:04

1jdjpc8,"CMV: If the Christian God exists, he is clearly evil.","The Bible portrays God as a being who frequently commits or commands acts that we would consider morally reprehensible if done by any human.

Take, for example, when God is described as flooding the entire earth, brutally drowning nearly all men, women, children - as well as animals, plants, and ecosystems. Today, we would call this an act of genocide.

Then there’s Sodom and Gomorrah where God burns an entire city alive, including innocents (such as children and presumably victims living within the city walls) to punish city wide “sin”. The story does not suggest any attempt to differentiate between the guilty and innocent, nor does it show God offering alternatives beyond torturous mass destruction.

What’s worse, during the plagues of Egypt, God murders the firstborn sons of Egypt, after  “hardening the heart” of the Pharaoh multiple times, deliberately preventing him from letting the Israelites go - escalating the situation to inevitable violence.

These are stories we tell to children to describe the “love” of God. 

If a human leader behaved this way - ordering genocides, killing children, and punishing entire populations for the actions of a few (while calling it “love”), we would brand them a war criminal.

1j5i2cq,CMV: The whole egg-based rhetoric against Trump is dumb and should be scrapped for better angles,"Yes, he did promise to lower egg prices. Yes, egg prices are as high as ever. Is that really a good long-term strategy though? I come from an authoritarian country and this ""day-to-day"" low-res type of logic is a trap that dictators use to delegitimize their opposition.

If your main argument is built around ""egg prices high = trump bad"" then what happens when he subsidizes the price? Or when he blames the ""opportunistic"" store-owners for robbing the working class? That is just populism 101.

Like come on guys, this is obviously such a shaky ground to use as your fundament, and yet, it's somehow used as a major point over and over again. This just isn't a viable strategy long-term.

My main point is: you don't fight dictatorship with stabs at routine stuff. It's very easy to fake that for any proper dictator and score easy points against opposition. Forget about converting the ""economy first"" crowd into democrats, this isn't happening. They don't really care about it as much as they say they do. It's always been just an easy justification for staying bigoted.

Trump has already done so much real malicious harm to the world and his people, this egg-price angle just makes me sick and cheapens the rest of the points against him.

1kb1fjd,CMV: A factor pushing young men to the right is the lack of left leaning media that appeals to traditional males and their interests.,"Put a simpler way it's very difficult to find a good podcast on topics like hunting, fishing, fixing cars, agriculture, ect that isn't hosted by people with a conservative bend. And even if you go in with intention of ignoring any political comments when you're listening to or watching someone for hours each week then their views will begin to influence you whether you realise it or not.

A friend recently showed me a few episodes of the John Oliver show and while I found it interesting I kept getting pulled out of it by long, drawn out monologues about how horny he is for horses, or how much he wants to sexually assault star wars actor Adam Driver, or even multiple jokes about how scary making phone calls is. Needless to say but for your typical tradie scared of phone ringing is not relatable humour.

I don't think people realise the gap in culture between inner city office workers and more rural trades people, even little jokes that pop up constantly in modern entertainment like ""if you're part of generation ... you'll never own a house"" or ""if you're under 30 you don't have to pay attention because our next piece is about home ownership"". Most of my mates are in their 20's and already own homes so even these types of comments create a sense of unrelatability. 

So in summary I believe what could be considered mainstream left leaning humour and entertainment doesn't appeal to a lot of young guys and that is why they are flooding to people like Joe Rogan and other more conservative entertainers, because at least they're talking about something the guys are interested in.",New-Perspective6209,3869,2491,0.8399999737739563,0.8380810905277876,1745967132,/r/changemyview/comments/1kb1fjd/cmv_a_factor_pushing_young_men_to_the_right_is/,2025,4,changemyview,2025-04-29 22:52:12
1jw3hht,CMV: Many Americans have no grasp on reality and it’s largely why we’re in this mess.,"I was talking to my boyfriend the other night about how Americans have become so soft. Now I’m not a conservative by a long shot, I’m very much on the left. But I was talking about how if the civil rights movement or the movement for women’s suffrage had happened today, those groups either wouldn’t have achieved their goals or it would have been *way more* difficult because people just seem so apathetic and uncaring.

This led me into saying that I really think a large majority of Americans have no real grasp on reality. Sure, if you’re in true poverty or are homeless in this country, that’s absolutely gonna suck and will be a horrible and traumatizing experience. However, most people who make an average salary are doing fine. Sure, you’ll probably need a roommate in more expensive areas and I do think that’s an issue, but still… even living with a roommate in an apartment is like… fine (at least to me).

Americans are so landlocked and separated away from any countries that experience *true and intense* hardships, that I really do believe we’ve come to the ideal that not being able to buy what you want all the time is the biggest hardship of all.

I think the amount of wealth that can be gained in this country really messes with people’s perception of what is normal. It’s normal to need a roommate, it’s normal to live in a smaller house, it’s normal to have to budget. But because we see people living extravagant lifestyles, we believe that somehow… through sheer force of will, we could also get there.

I also think it makes normal salaries that are fine amounts of money seem “small.” Like, I make 70k and I live in a large city in Missouri, but it’s really a mid sized city compared to others in the country. I live in a nice apartment building, can pay my rent and bills, and still buy and do things I want every once in a while. But somehow people have decided that 70-80k is still… not that much money?

I think Americans have been sold a lie that we can forgo social services in the name of being a country where you can *possibly, but probably not* make all the money you could ever dream of and more. If we had subsidized healthcare, parental leave, etc we probably wouldn’t feel the need to make over six figures, but people have decided that it’s more important to possibly be able to become a billionaire than to have services that would actually relieve stress and money issues.

Americans don’t want to admit that maybe they’ll be average for their whole lives and that is ruining us as a country.",MissHannahJ,5722,587,0.8999999761581421,0.6178241670012043,1744305936,/r/changemyview/comments/1jw3hht/cmv_many_americans_have_no_grasp_on_reality_and/,2025,4,changemyview,2025-04-10 17:25:36
1kbowjo,CMV: The MAGA hat is the modern equivalent of a Nazi-era swastika armband,"Now, to be clear, I'm not claiming that MAGA supporters are Nazis, or that the U.S. today is equivalent to 1930s Germany.  But I am arguing that the MAGA hat serves a similar *s*ocial function to the swastika armband during the Nazi rise to power.  Both are symbols worn in public to signal loyalty to a political movement grounded in nationalism, identity politics, and authoritarian leadership.

[Research shows that political symbols shape group identity and public perception](https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/8/6/50).  The swastika armband marked allegiance to an ideology that promoted ethnic superiority and rejected democratic norms.  The MAGA hat, while originally a campaign slogan, has become strongly associated with anti-immigrant sentiment, misinformation, and efforts to undermine democratic elections.  [FBI data shows that hate crimes rose significantly after Trump’s 2016 election. ](https://www.newsweek.com/hate-crimes-under-trump-surged-nearly-20-percent-says-fbi-report-1547870) Studies from [Pew ](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/07/18/americans-say-the-nations-political-debate-has-grown-more-toxic-and-heated-rhetoric-could-lead-to-violence/)and [SPLC ](https://www.splcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/yih_2020_final.pdf)(Southern Poverty Law Center) indicate that MAGA-drive aggressive language by politicians makes violence more likely, correlating with spikes in xenophobia and political violence.

While the MAGA hat doesn’t carry the same historical weight or scale of atrocity, it increasingly functions as a marker of political tribalism and fear for marginalized groups.  Like the armband, it defines an “us” and a “them.”

1jz4zpk,CMV: The culture war is functionally over and the conservatives won.,"I am the last person on earth who wants to believe this, and I feel utterly horrified and devastated, but I cannot convince myself that anything other than a massive shift towards conservative cultural views, extending to a significant extreme is in the cards across the anglosphere, and quite possibly beyond, and maybe lasting as long as our civlization persists.

Before last month, I wasn't sure, I thought that there could be a resurgence, a strong opposition at least, or failing that, balkanization into more progressive and more traditional societies.

Thing is, all of that hinged on one key premise: that this was completely ineffective on recruiting women, and that between the majority of women and minority of men still believing in institutuons and civil liberties recovery was possible. Then, I saw something, the sudden rise of Candace Owens in a celebrity gossip context. She now controls a lot of this narrative, and it's getting her views from women. SocialBlade indicates that about 10% of her 4 million subscribers therabouts came from the last month, and the pipeline is real. Her channel has shockingly recent content regarding a ""demonic agenda"" in popular music as well as moon landing conspiracy theories (to say nothing of the antisemitism and tradwifery I already knew was wrong with her). A lot of women may end up down the same pipeline as their male counterparts due to the front-end content, and it scares me.

Without as much opposition, I'm terrified of the next phase of our world. Even if genocide and hatred are averted, I fear in a few decades we'll have state-enforced religion, women banned outright from a lot of jobs, science supressed via destroying good research and data, a ban on styles of music marked 'satanic', and AI slop placating the populace and insisting it's how things ""should be"", and with algorithms feeding constant reinforcement, I don't see a path out of this state of affairs.

1jslh6d,CMV: Muslims are afforded a right to be bigoted in a way other groups aren’t.,"In my experience, Muslims in the West are given almost a carte blanche to be as hateful as they please, in a way that no other group is. For example, Charlottesville was universally condemned. Nobody was justifying the angry mob yelling that Jews will not replace us. On the other hand, when Muslim students organize riots on college campuses that are in support of a terrorist organization that is racist, sexist, antisemitic, and opposed to western values, people call it free speech.

A study was published recently that showed that people were more likely to be in favor of the deportation of a European student for harassing Jews than a Palestinian/Muslim student who engaged in the same behavior. 

It seems like society is so afraid of being called Islamophobic that Muslims end up getting a free pass for behavior that wouldn’t be acceptable from anyone else. People oppose homophobia, unless it’s the Muslim city council in Michigan passing a resolution to ban gay pride flags from public property.

The MeToo movement was very talked about and of course people stood against r*pists and sexual assault. Then October 7th happened and suddenly everyone was blaming Jewish women for being sexually assaulted by Muslims or accused the victims of lying for gain.

This plays out in very dangerous ways, too. People fall into a bigotry of low expectations with regards to rampant human rights abuses in Muslim countries. People storm the streets for women’s rights in the west, but are silent when it comes to middle eastern women being forbidden from the most basic rights, such as the right to even speak out loud or choose what to wear. 

For years, and especially since October 7th, people have said that Muslims/Palestinians have a “right” to be bigoted against Jews because of perceived grievances. Those same people would never excuse antisemitism from a white person.

1kas1qr,CMV: A growing percentage of single men is not something to be “solved” by trying to figure out how to get more men access to relationships with women.,"**Disclaimer: Apologies for the wall of text. I do kindly request that people not respond without reading the entire post if they can help it. Also the context of this view is from a western (mostly UK/US) perspective, and should not be applied to societies outside of this**

The so-called “epidemic” of single men is the natural progression of a society where women have the freedom and autonomy to opt out of relationships with men, and nothing can (or should) be “done” to reverse this. As women gain greater economic and professional independence many are increasingly choosing to forgo traditional romantic or sexual partnerships, inevitably leaving an increasing segment of men without the kind of access to relationships that once was readily available to a larger percentage of men.

In my opinion, because this is a natural result of women's increased self-sufficiency, this is not something that can be “solved” (as in reversed) without infringing upon women’s ability to choose what kind of lives they want to live & relationships they want to be in.

I’m not sure I believe popular narrative that a growing number of single men reflects some sudden decline in male quality—I think, rather, a climate in which women are able (and thus increasingly likely) to choose solitude over being in a relationship. No doubt there’s some overlap between men who can’t find partners and men who are disturbingly misogynistic, immature, socially awkward, have unrealistic expectations, bad hygiene etc—but I’m not sure that such men represent the majority of men who can’t find partners rather than an obnoxiously loud minority. Instead I think many despite their best efforts just can’t successfully compete with the appeal of solitude, independence and self-fulfillment that a growing number of women now have the ability to prioritize. **To be clear, I’m not saying men as individuals shouldn’t try to compete, or be given advice to increase their chances, but that the number of unsuccessful men will likely continue to increase regardless.**

This reality isn’t likely to change as long as we live in a society that protects women’s autonomy, and that’s a good thing. **Therefore we need to start thinking about how to help men cope with this new reality**, instead of trying to engineer ways to decrease the number of single men (and honestly all the non-authoritarian “solutions” I’ve seen that boil down to this, read as denial of the fact that women’s increased self-sufficiency results in more single men).

Society should instead look for ways to offer all men alternative frameworks for meaning, identity and connection that don’t hinge upon securing romantic/sexual access to women & their reproductive labor. This is what should be “done” about the growing number of men who will likely never marry/reproduce. Or rather, done to *support* the ones who need it.

This support could begin with dismantling the cultural narrative that defines manhood (in part) through milestones related to women such as securing a partner or becoming a father. It should also include increasing men’s access to other forms of connection & emotional fulfilment beyond romantic/sexual partnerships. But before that can happen, we need to dismantle the deeply ingrained narrative around men’s emotions—the idea that emotional expression is a weakness, intimacy is reserved for romantic relationships, and vulnerability makes a man less “manly.” As long as emotional depth is culturally coded as feminine or shameful, men will continue to struggle to build fulfilling & meaningful platonic bonds and seek emotional connection outside of romance.  

It should also involve dismantling social constructs that reward men for fitting into this narrow scope of masculinity. For example, husbands/fathers are more likely to receive promotions or raises, often justified by increased financial obligation, **but also rooted in perceptions of higher competence, capability, maturity and dependability compared to single/childfree men simply because they’re fathers (despite typically not even shouldering the brunt of child-rearing or emotional labor that relationships incur).** This is called the “Fatherhood Premium”. Meanwhile, women in similar positions face the opposite effect called the “Motherhood Penalty”, and don’t get the benefit of being perceived as more competent or capable just because they’re mothers, so this perk isn’t really about supporting families as much as it’s about rewarding men for being husbands/fathers.

**Even if salary increases for men with greater financial obligations due to parenthood is justified, the broader perception of husbands/fathers as inherently more competent, mature, capable or dependable than single/childfree men is problematic**. We need to build a culture where single and childfree men (people in general but this post is about men) are not seen as lacking and where their contributions, attributes and potential are just as valued.

One of the biggest obstacles to this progress is that men with access to these perks want to keep this access exclusive to men like them (like how the wealthy want to keep wealth among the wealthy).  Afterall, it’s usually men with wives & children who control the institutions that dole out these benefits to men like them. I don’t have the answer to how we dismantle this obstacle but I believe it’s worth those who care about the wellbeing of single men collectively taking a stab.

To keep this from getting any longer, this merely the tip of the iceberg. But these are ideas that don’t boil down to “figure out why the women don’t want the men and do something about it!” The goal shouldn’t be to force partnerships where they’re not wanted, it should be to build a society where men can thrive emotionally with or without them, the same way we’ve shifted towards a society where women increasingly thrive with or without them.",bobothecarniclown,605,1804,0.6899999976158142,0.4149697035858275,1745943716,/r/changemyview/comments/1kas1qr/cmv_a_growing_percentage_of_single_men_is_not/,2025,4,changemyview,2025-04-29 16:21:56
1jubiil,CMV: The 2024 Election could have been stolen and there is enough evidence to start state level investigations.,"Hello Redditors,

I’m fairly new to Reddit and social media (I know, super late to the game), so **forgive me if this post is too long or doesn’t obey some sort of Reddit norm that I don’t know about.** 

I was responding to a post in r/AdviceAnimals yesterday, and I found some of the reactions to my comment a bit odd. Based on the level of evidence I've read - I believe the 2024 election could have been stolen.

I was told that there’s *“no evidence”* that the 2024 election was stolen. That it’s all baseless. That it’s over, and that people questioning the results are anti-democratic. Pretty odd given the guy who occupies the White House still denies the last one. 

But here’s the thing: when you actually look at the data (unlike the last election where there really was no data to support any sort of fraud, and yes, I looked), public records, and even the statements made inside the White House after the election, a very different picture starts to form. I’m not saying this definitively proves the election was stolen, but if this isn’t at least worth investigating, then what is? 

I’ve tried to summarize the major facts so far as objectively as possible. Let me be very clear here: **I AM NOT A LIBERAL, BUT I DO DESPISE DONALD TRUMP AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY.**   
  
I consider myself a diehard centrist or even a radical independent. There are things I agree with Trump on, things I agree with Biden on, hell, I even agreed with SOME of RFK’s stuff on food additives and such. I really strive to look at every issue independently. Now, also to be clear, I despise Donald Trump because he is a low-quality human, he implements his ideas like a mobster in the 1970s and he's turned people into douches, BUT I’m trying not to let this bias impact my assessment. 

Let me lay out the evidence that at least warrants examinations of the cast vote records in all swing states and audit each of the ballot counting machines, including any software updates that could have been done before election day.

**1. Trump’s Own Statements**

On January 19, 2025, during a pre-inauguration rally in Washington, D.C., Donald Trump expressed gratitude towards Elon Musk for his support during the campaign, particularly in Pennsylvania. He stated: 

“He journeyed to Pennsylvania where he spent a month and a half campaigning for me… and he’s a popular guy. He knows those computers better than anybody. All those computers. Those vote-counting computers. And we ended up winning Pennsylvania like in a landslide.”  

Then during a FIFA World Cup announcement, Trump veered from soccer talk to politics when reflecting on how the United States secured hosting rights during his first administration. ""When we made this, it was made during my term, my first term, and it was so sad because I said, can you imagine, I'm not going to be President, and that's too bad,"" Trump said. ""And what happened is they rigged the election and I became President, so that was a good thing.""

Sure, Donald Trump is an idiot and says incoherent stuff all the time, but two incidents and one directly referencing the “vote-counting computers” do seem extremely fishy, especially given the work of the Election Truth Alliance or ETA.   
  
I’ve seen some Reddit posts criticizing these guys, but I’ve listened to the few videos they’ve produced, and they don’t have that same aura of bias that the election deniers from 2020 had. But again, this absolutely is circumstantial evidence at best – I think hearsay would be the appropriate classification, but these comments do and Trump's past statements about the 2020 election being rigged establish motive. 

**2. Clark County, NV**

Let’s move on to Nevada. The Election Truth Alliance analyzed the Cast Vote Records (CVR) from Clark County, raw voting machine data publicly available, and found multiple quantitative anomalies that demand answers.

*a. Drop-Off Voting Discrepancy:*

A “drop-off vote” is when someone votes for president but skips down-ballot races. This is normal, but here’s the twist:

• Trump had a +10.54% drop-off rate.

• Harris had just +1.07%.

That’s a 10X discrepancy. Why would Trump voters overwhelmingly skip Senate races but  
Harris voters didn’t? That’s not just odd, it’s statistically glaring and does not line up with past trends from other swing states. In fact, in Pennsylvania in 2024, the drop-off rate was around 5% for Republicans, and in 2012, during the Obama v. Romney campaign, the drop-off was 6% for republicans. In other words, **10% is wildly high.** 

*b. Early Voting Tabulator Anomalies:*

In early voting, the more ballots a tabulator processed, the more predictably skewed the results became:

• At tabulators with <250 ballots, Trump and Harris showed reasonable variance.

• **But above 250 ballots, results converged tightly around Trump 60%, Harris 40%, across the board.**

Human voting behavior doesn’t do that. You don’t get rigid clusters from tens of thousands of individual choices unless something artificial is influencing the result - perhaps a software update from some future DOGE employees? I don't know, but it certainly seems that Elon and his group of wunderkids have the means to do something like hack into counting machines or deploy a software update to them to manipulate them.

*c. Different Voting Methods = Different Realities:*

• Mail-in ballots: Trump got just 36%.

• Early voting machines: Trump got 59%.

• Election Day ballots: Trump at 50%.

How can such wild swings exist by the voting method alone? If you believe in clean elections, you have to ask, why would someone’s preference change that drastically based on how they vote? Again, circumstantial evidence here, but these do not line up with historical averages at all.

All this isn’t opinion. It’s right there in the official public CVR data. And we haven’t even gotten to Pennsylvania yet. Granted, it takes some time and will to really read through and understand this stuff – but my god, if something is worth your time, it’s making sure that who you vote for actually counts. If not, then it’s the entire ball game. 

**3. Pennsylvania**

Pennsylvania is where historical voting patterns were flipped on their head, and no one seems to be asking why.

Traditionally, urban centers like Philadelphia vote Democrat, and rural counties lean Republican, but in 2024, heavily Democrat precincts saw abnormally low turnout, while swing counties reported turnout higher than registered voter levels in some cases.

ETA flagged precincts where:

• Ballots cast exceeded 100% of registered voters.

• Votes for Trump outnumbered total ballots submitted, based on county reporting timelines.

• Tabulation errors were “corrected” days later with no audit trail.

Are these smoking guns? No. But they’re not normal either. And in any functioning democracy, these would be red flags triggering mandatory investigations, not media blackouts and certainly not blind ignorance or calling people who question the results, anti-democratic. 

Ask yourself this: if the exact same anomalies had helped Harris win, if he had unusually low drop-off rates, suspicious clustering in early voting machines, and skewed turnout in major cities, wouldn’t the media, Trump himself and half the country be screaming for investigations?

Wouldn’t Republicans be marching in the streets, demanding transparency? You know they would.

But somehow, when the data points in favour of their guy, suddenly, the response is, “Shut up, conspiracy theorist.” Unlike the 2020 election, there is a straightforward narrative you can paint, using data and logic, that is downright diabolical if it is true.

I strongly encourage folks to go have a look and read through the materials themselves. The one thing the Election Truth Alliance is doing is providing comprehensive documentation on their efforts, unlike many of the election deniers from 2020. 

And please, if you review this material and then say, “Hey, you’ve misinterpreted something,” – change my view, please, because this is truly exhausting.

No condition that he is or conditions in the prison could be worse than him being shipped off and literally murdered there. Even if beatings/rape/slavery were the case, he is still being held in a prison in his country of origin and they could make some kind of justification for his remaining there. Evidence of his being alive doesn't give US judges, senators, lawyers any more power to get him back but would allow the Trump admin to benefit by them saying ""see liberals - you're overreacting because he is alive.""

1k1od4a,CMV: Voting Republican today is a fundamentally inhumane act.,"Over the past several years, I've come to believe that the modern Republican party—and by extension, many who support it—actively vote against the wellbeing of vulnerable people. From policies on healthcare and education to the way marginalized communities are treated, I see a pattern of cruelty, apathy, and an unwillingness to engage with the broader impact of their votes.

This has led me to a cynical conclusion: Republican voters either don't care about others, lack the critical thinking to see the harm being done, or are simply echoing the beliefs of their social circles without deeper examination. I’ve struggled to see meaningful counterexamples, and I worry that “conservatism” today is less a philosophy and more a brand that people follow blindly.

I know this is a harsh stance—and I’m open to being challenged on it. If I’m wrong, I want to understand how. Are there values in today’s Republican voting base that prioritize humanity? Can voting Republican in today’s political climate still be morally defensible?

1k1ivtj,CMV: the American Left is too disorganized and decentralized to be of any use against MAGA,"There's an old saying about politics in America: when it comes to politicians, the Left has to fall in love, while the Right falls in line. It’s a huge generalization (the first of many I’ll make here), but there may be something to it.

The Left likes to mock MAGA for being idiots, but they have POTUS, 2/3 of SCOTUS, a congressional majority, and the world’s richest men who just so happen to control the most powerful media corporations. Who exactly is the party of idiots here?

This domination of government didn’t happen by chance; it’s the result of decades of careful planning by conservative organizations. The Right is excellent at branding; they come up with a bumper sticker slogan and they all stick to it relentlessly, regardless of how counterfactual it might be. Call them sheep, but they know how to organize.

The Left, on the other hand, is a circular firing squad ready to slaughter any of their own who don’t pass an ideological purity contest. (See the opposition for Biden/Harris on Gaza even when Trump made it abundantly clear he would bulldoze Gaza.). If the Right is a pack of wolves (or sheep) the Left is a pack of cats, utterly useless at organization.

The Left is great at theatrical protests, and terrible at actually getting anything done. Take the Tesla protests for example. Why would you film yourself throwing paint all over a Tesla dealership? You go to jail, possibly get slapped with domestic terrorism charges, and they wash the paint off the next day. It’s pure theater. 100% attack, 0% damage.

They could accomplish far more if they weren’t so focused on theatrical protests. Tere are only 160 Tesla stores in the US. It would be easy to find 160 individuals willing to sneak by in the dead of night with a squirt gun full of paint thinner and do far more damage without getting arrested, but that would require some degree of organization. \[\*NOTE: I'm absolutely 100% NOT advocating vandalism or any other criminal activity. I'm just pointing out that I’m an average schmuck with no activist credentials and it took me less than 30 seconds to come up with a solution that would be more economically devastating than what these feckless clickbait slacktivists have done.\*\]

Occupy Wall Street is another great example. It was very theatrical, and made for great TV, but what exactly did they stand for? What did they accomplish? There was no unified message, so it was too easy to divide and conquer, and the movement accomplished basically nothing.

The Right has been proactive and is very well organized. The Left is reactive and disorganized.

1jsox9n,CMV: America has no way to remove Trump due to its ridiculously entrenched laws for the preservation of the presidency.,"All the protests, discontents, negative poll numbers, and even a majority republican dissent will NOT be able to remove Trump from office. 

They have tried to impeach Trump twice, and it did not work. 

If impeaching Trump for actual CRIMES did not work, then the constitution has NOTHING else to enable the removal of a US president. 

He would literally have to kill an innocent person on video to be successfully removed from office. 

Incompetence, greed, selfishness, gross negligence, ignorance, egomaniacal, general scumminess, ruining the economy and foreign relation, even actual fascism will NOT be enough to remove Trump, because American laws for removing the president is so weak that nothing sort of an actual horrible crime (murder, rape, treason) can lead to a successful prosecution and removal. 

A ""No confidence"" vote is not a thing for the American presidency. 

""But sir, surely actual fascism is enough to remove the President, right?"" -- I don't think so, because by then it would be too damn late and all the laws will be changed to keep him in power, Nazi style. 

It's relatively easy to vote someone into the presidency but ridiculously hard to remove them before their end of term. 

Trump could literally turn America upside down and inside out, dragging the world down with America and STILL remain in office. 

If any American constitutional/law/presidency experts could change my view on this, please enlighten me. I would LOVE to be proven wrong because this is becoming absolutely ridiculous.

1-Ukranians share similar cultures, values, politics, and religion with other Europeans countries unlike Arab and Africans so Ukranians integrate way easier in Europe than Arab and African ones due culture similarities.


2- Arab and African countries do the same thing to Ukranian refugees, not a single Arab or African nation took Ukranians as refugees, but many of these nations took other Arab and African refugees.


3-Companies prefer hiring immigrants from poor third world countries over hiring locals and immigrants from developed countries because of cheap labour which hurts the local population so it's natural for locals to oppose immigration from poor countries.

1k43r3m,CMV: Citizens United was the worst thing to happen to the American political landscape,"Ever since the Citizens United v. FEC decision in 2010, I’ve felt like the integrity of American democracy has been steadily deteriorating. The ruling essentially said that corporations and other outside entities can spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections, under the banner of free speech. To me, that decision opened the floodgates to unchecked political spending, dark money, and disproportionate influence by the ultra-wealthy and powerful interest groups.

I believe this has led to:

	•	Unaccountable Super PACs spending billions with little transparency.

	•	Candidates beholden to donors, not voters, because campaigns are now insanely expensive when they likely wouldn’t be if Super PACs weren’t in bidding wars for ad time. Don’t even get me started on how some people in office can’t be bothered to attend a town hall with constituents. 

	•	Distorted public discourse, where those with the biggest megaphones (and more money than any reasonable coalition of voters could amass) shape the narrative.

	•	Widening political cynicism — many people feel like their vote or voice doesn’t matter when billionaires and corporations can outspend entire communities.

Occupy wall street didn't fix the finance system. BLM didn't improve policing. The womens march didn't improve access to women's healthcare.

I think that in order to make a meaningful change your goals need to be specific and tailored. For example a good protest would be to go to a state house demanding that you want to be a sanctuary state. A bad protest would be to go to a state house to let them know how much you disagree with the president. 

A more effective (not the most effective) path towards social change would be email campaigns. You can directly tell the individual in power what change you want to see and why you want to see it and that you will not vote for them if this change is not enacted.

1jza96b,CMV: Donald Trump should be removed via Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution,"Section 4 of the 25th Amendment states:



""Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.



Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.""



I believe the President's Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office using this section. The 25th Amendment would also give cover to the Senate and the House to determine that the President is mentally incompetent, especially if there is evidence to support it. So it's safer for Congress to use this method instead of impeachment, because they can say that they support Trump, but that he ""lost his mental capacity.""



\*\*I think Congress would also be in their rights to hold votes through secret ballot as well, because they would like to protect their families from retaliation from an irrational President, who has shown a willingness to retaliate against anyone he perceives to be his enemy (\[see the attempted assassination of Nancy Pelosi by a supporter of his attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer in their home\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack\_on\_Paul\_Pelosi)), and who does not comply with the Rule of Law, or Due Process under the Constitution.\*\*



I think this would be a powerful argument because Trump's irrationality is self-evident through his own actions. For example, he is ignoring the advice of experienced experts in the government, he's instituting tariffs and rolling tariffs back, he's not following due process, and he's acting very irrationally. There is an unprecedented attack on our system of government, and there needs to be a determined and legally justifiable response to oust Trump, as soon as possible.



Through the 25th Amendment, the process would proceed as follows:







\- The VP and a majority of the Cabinet write a letter to the Senate President & House Speaker stating that Trump is not mentally competent, and the VP will assume the Presidency



\- Trump writes a letter back, stating that he is mentally competent, and attempts to take the power back



\- The VP & Cabinet write another letter stating that he is not mentally competent, and prevents him from taking the power back



\- The Senate and House must convene within 48 hours and rule by a 2/3 vote that Trump is or is not mentally competent within 21 days, this can be done by secret ballot for the safety of members of Congress







This is a historic moment, and I believe drastic steps need to take place to save our system of government. This is a legal method. :) People need to use their personal and institutional influence to lobby for this to happen, because our systems of government are under attack and we are at risk of losing everything.

1jsmudk,CMV: There were no protestors paid to attend the protests across the us yesterday.,"Looking at the republican subs as well as their media I've seen a lot of talk about paid protestors. Rogan famously quipped that protestors were being paid $1400 each to protest.

I've seen zero evidence of this occurring. 

Some criteria for my claim. 

What is a paid protestor? Someone who is paid to go to a protest. 

What this doesn't cover? Organizations do exist and often engage in logistics. They may print signs or bring in sound equipment, etc. This is different than the claim that protestors were being paid to attend the protests across the us yesterday. 

Organizers are not protestors. Here's why. J6 was organized by women for America first. A pro trunp organization led by Amy Kremer. This group worked on securing permits, booking speakers, getting a stage and sound system, etc. This does not mean that Amy Kremer paid those present at January 6th, and the January 6ers were also not paid protesters. 

Women for America first is also not a non profit organization which means it is far less transparent than other groups that are doing similar logistics. Unlike many non profits. The origins of the funding for Women for America first have never been disclosed. Really. We have no idea who paid for January 6. However, even in this extreme example I wouldn't argue that J6ers were paid protestors. 

What would change my view? Evidence anyone attending the protestors yesterday was being paid for protesting.

1k2w2c4,CMV: We are witnessing the end of Pax Americana in real time,"For context, I am not American and these are my views from the stance of a person living in a Western nation allied to America.

**1. The end of the American economic order**

Donald Trump's tariffs are from my POV, completely insane. Each of their stated goals are completely contradictory from each other, way too broad and universal to have any of the useless effects a properly though-out tariff policy would have, and target many of America's allies. Not only that, when Trump started the trade war with China, they completely crumbled against the pressure and exempted China's key hi-tech industries and are begging Xi Jinping to call the White House for a ""deal"". With bilateral trade basically not existing anymore, China can still source a lot of their US imports (which from what I gather are primarily agricultural products) from other countries, but America is screwed as they relied on China for a lot of renewable and computer tech. The dollar is weakening, and China is sitting on a ton of the USD reserves they can unleash to seriously damage America's ability to finance its debts.

I really don't want to be a doomer, but the US really seems to be in a precarious position. It seems like America wants to achieve autarky and isolate from the global market, but it seems like they are approaching it in the worst way imaginable as they are simultaneously weakening their's and their allies' positions while strengthening China's. We're not even past 100 days of Trump's presidency.

**2. End of the rule of law in America**

With Trump ignoring a Supreme Court order, the judiciary is left with no enforcement mechanism to make the executive comply. That just leaves the legislative branch as the final check through impeachment, but I very much doubt this will happen even if the Democrats sweep the midterms. The Trump administration is literally wiping their ass with established norms and the rule of law, and the worst part is that it seems that a sizeable portion of the American public is either ambivalent or supportive of this.

I won't go as far as to say that this will cause a civil war down the line, but I do believe that if this trajectory continues, then America is looking at an extremely turbulent period that I would imagine would be akin to the Years of Lead in Italy. Combined with the economic troubles that I mentioned earlier, it seems very likely for America to become even more insular, unstable, and even authoritarian.

**3. Geopolitical Instability**

America has completely abdicated any semblance of responsibility over being world police--case in point, Ukraine. Now, I very much recognise that the merits of being world police is a debatable topic, however, I think its just a fact that--irrespective of whether or not you think America has the moral duty to ensure a fledgeling democracy is not invaded by an imperialist power--I think that it just makes good geopolitical sense to ensure Ukraine wins or at least stalemates against a nation that is actively hostile to Western interests. The only conflicts that Trump is willing to take sides with seems to be countries that he has personal financial interests in (I think he has or at least wants to build a Trump tower in Moscow although I might be wrong on that and he definitely has assets in Israel for example).  
  
If, tomorrow, China declares war on Taiwan, it seems very unlikely for the US to lift a finger. All it takes is one direct encroachment into what used to be America's red line, and the world will find out that the America giant has fallen asleep again.

**Conclusion**

All in all, it is very hard for me to be optimistic about the longevity of American hegemony in the 21st century. I have personal gripes about America and the imposition of their will in my home countries' politics, however, I still do believe they are LEAGUES better than the alternative of China or Russia or any other nations in the ""axis of evil"". Trump has completely set alight the power of America--both soft and hard--for no apparent reason. He is not only dumb, in my view, but also weak. Even if you take the MAGA movement's purported goals at face value and agree that they are sound, they have achieved none of it. Best case scenario is that the current Trump presidency is just a bout of insanity that will take years to recover from. Worst case is that Trump has set alight a fuse to a bomb that will blow up in all of our faces some time in the future and end the American hegemony for better or worse.

Openly and full throatedly lying in thousands of instances and defaming or straight up censoring media.

Helping other dictators achieve their goals and stay in power, while also full throatedly supporting and praising them.

1kaq24g,CMV: Nothing will fix the Democratic brand,"It’s become increasingly clear the American Democratic Party is in need of rehabilitation. As I’ve discussed in a past post on here (with more of a focus on the Senate), the map of competitive states has shrunken to near-fatal levels—to hold the Senate, Democrats must hold 12-14 (depending on if they can win Maine back from the invincible Susan Collins and whether they hold the VP tiebreaker) of the 14 swing state Senate seats. Since 2008, Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, Ohio, Arkansas, and West Virginia have all become noncompetitive seats that Dems used to be able to win. Additionally, the census after 2030 makes the blue wall not enough for Democrats to win the presidency. New swing states are not opening up, nor is there any reason to believe this is possibility—if anything, new swing states will be formerly Democratic states like New Hampshire or New Mexico.

Even so, Democratic leadership is unwilling or unable to acknowledge the scale of the problem. The Senate map is the most polarized it’s been in 100 years. Every Democratic Senator from a red state has lost. The party faces a leadership crisis, but is committed to sabotaging anyone who’s too progressive who might step up (see Wasserman-Schultz’s sabotage of Bernie, Pelosi’s sabotage of AOC, the DNC’s threats towards David Hogg).

In red states, the party is perceived as radical socialists who only care about guns and gender issues, both of which are extremely unpopular, but something that the party has been unwilling to examine (see the election of David Hogg to DNC vice chair, party response to Seth Moulton’s comments expressing skepticism on the trans focus). Democrats face record unpopularity. Yet, even as Trump’s approval rating falls, the Democratic disapproval is actually INCREASING. No matter what Republicans do or how badly they fuck up, Democrats are seen as worse. Nothing suggests the party is prepared to confront their unelectability in massive portions of the country. It’s only getting worse with no reason to believe things will reverse course. I’m not even convinced that things **can** change. I think Republicans could run a Holocaust and a good 35–40% would still say “well, at least the Democrats aren’t in charge”.

1jps0hk,CMV: America is actually a really great place to be in,"Despite it's political issues, America is a really good place to be in. 

1. It is one of the most accepting countries in the world. Despite what the republicans are trying to do and what the democrats are saying about it, America is still one of the most inclusive countries in the world. For starters, there are not a lot of countries in general where minorities are accepted, and racism is prevalent in lots of the world. 
2. America is also placed in a really good geographic location. A lot of conflicts brewing are going on in Europe, The Middle East or in Asia. America has an entire ocean between these conflicts and even assuming American involvement in these conflicts (Which seems less likely with the new administration), a lot of people won't experience the effects of this first hand because of how far away it is. That means America is also relatively stable, as there is very little risk of invasion of the continental United States. And add the fact that America is moving isolationist and already has one of the smallest percentage of imports accounting for GDP means that it's extremely well-placed to weather out any storms. 
3. America also has a bright future. America is extremely unlikely to experience a ""brain drain"" and a lot of smart people from other countries are still immigrating into America. Its economy will most likely rebound after the current administration, and the country also has a lot of natural resources, which are becoming more scarce by the day. It is also at the forefront of technological innovation, with it leading multiple sectors. 
4. Americans have lots of freedoms. American are one of the freest people in the world, able to say nearly anything they want. In a lot of countries, including Korea and some European countries, free speech is limited. Americans can mock the president, make fun of the government and go out and protest which is not a very common right. Americans are also able to own guns, which is unheard of elsewhere.

Current politics may seem bleak, but even with that, America is still a wonderful place to be in, a country I'd love to live in as well. I do have a bit of a bias since I'm a Korean HS student wanting to move to America, but I believe all my points are valid.

1jz2qrf,CMV: NATO is a paper tiger without the US,"Let me preface by saying I am not anti-NATO or anti-US involvement in NATO. I am all for the alliance and cooperation between its members and wholeheartedly disagree with our current President’s stance on the US commitment to NATO, our other allies, and Ukraine. But.

Trump, and the Presidents before him that have said the same, are right to demand that our partners in NATO pull their weight. And never has that been more clear why that’s needed than right now.

Recently, 31 countries formed what they called a “coalition of the willing” that would step up and send troops to Ukraine to help maintain any kind of peace that would come of the war. Yet now, it is being reported that only 6 of those countries actually consider themselves ready and willing to put ground forces in Ukraine amid fears the US would refuse to join a peacekeeping mission.

Amid all the recent dumb shit decisions regarding our security commitments to Europe by the current administration, many politicians, citizens, and users online have been very vocally advocating for the rest of NATO to step up and take over where the US is failing right now, and this coalition was treated as step in that direction.

But time and time again, many European countries, Canada, and many of our western non-NATO Allie’s like Australia and New Zealand show they’re all talk when it comes to security guarantees. Their militaries are all* underfunded and facing huge recruitment crises. Yet they tout providing arms to Ukraine as a huge win while collectively providing a fraction of the US has, and usually resulting in military units being left with serious deficits of equipment to provide to Ukraine while waiting on replacements.

It seems pretty clear to me, that under the current situation there’s no feasible way NATO could remain the effective global security alliance it has been if the United States really were to withdraw from its commitments, and anyone who thinks it could without serious hard changes being made that need time to bear fruit needs to wake up.

*I should elaborate that I am mostly referring to Western Europe with these criticisms.

1k6z9hi,CMV: Trump wasn’t wrong to demand NATO allies spend the amount agreed upon in 2014 on defense.,"And yes I know that on Reddit, Trump is always wrong. If he said the sky was blue, it'd be a nazi dog whistle.

Please leave the trump hate aside and give me a real reason why it was acceptable for our NATO allies to not spend the agreed upon amount from 2014-2022.

In 2014 after Russia's takeover of Crimea, NATO members agreed to increase defense spending to 2% of their respective GDPs.

They did this because of the clear and present danger to the east named Putin. They did they so that they would be prepared if Russia were to invade Ukraine again.

Even after Trump kept bringing it up in NATO meetings, only 6 members were spending the agreed upon amount all the way until 2022.

In 2022, what was feared happened. Russia invaded Ukraine. By 2024, a little over 20 member states are paying the agreed upon amount.

Herein lies the issue. This is like not studying for a math exam until the morning before, then asking if you can cheat off of your friend who studied for weeks.

Military spending takes time to develop, create, and stockpile weaponry. Most of the EU NATO countries are 6 years behind on what was agreed upon.

European defenses should be 6 years more developed than they are now. They should have multiple times the military stockpiles that they do.

So other than trump being hitler, what are some reasons why it is acceptable for them to rely on our military aid when they won't honor their monetary agreements?",Equal_Personality157,361,918,0.5799999833106995,0.2158082624185972,1745518579,/r/changemyview/comments/1k6z9hi/cmv_trump_wasnt_wrong_to_demand_nato_allies_spend/,2025,4,changemyview,2025-04-24 18:16:19
1k1jw7j,CMV: The International community unironically fueled the war in Gaza,"To start off: You won't change my mind on who started the conflict or who of the two sides is largely at fault, because today we are talking about the world's reaction to the war in Gaza - and how this reaction fueled it despite the constant calls for a ceasefire.



*1. Hamas' PR strategy fooled the entire world - and despite its success, the situation in Gaza is nowhere near good.*

There's no denying that the war has been a catastrophe for Palestinians, but what’s being overlooked is the role Hamas plays in this. Hamas has long used civilians as pawns in its military strategy, launching rockets and attacks from civilian areas like schools, hospitals, and mosques. They know that any retaliation from Israel will result in civilian casualties, which they can then exploit to fuel global outrage. 

**This strategy isn’t just reckless, it’s deliberate.** Hamas knows that every innocent death in Gaza brings more pressure on Israel to cease fire, yet it has shown no intention of changing its tactics because it gets little to no backlash, even though they are causing immense harm to its own people. Despite this strategy, Gaza is in complete ruins and the Israeli government are not even considering to end the war until Hamas' surrender and the release of the remaining hostages.



*2. The International community's one sided approach backfired horribly.*

Pushing for ceasefires and imaginary 2-state solutions don’t address the root cause of the current war: Hamas’s terrorism and the threat it poses to innocent Israeli civilians. 

The international community is only extending the war, because each time the world calls for a ceasefire without putting significant pressure on Hamas and its allies to surrender and release all of the hostages - which are, surpisingly one of the main reasons the war is still ongoing. This **emboldens Hamas AND the Israeli government.** The longer this goes on, the more extremist factions on both sides gain influence.

Which leads me to my most important point:

  
*3. Netanyahu’s political survival heavily depended on international pressure to cover his failure on October 7th.*

The international community’s insistence on condemning Israel’s military actions without holding Hamas accountable for its role in starting the war played directly into Netanyahu’s hands. The October 7th massacres was the largest single-day slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. Over 1,200 civilians were killed, shot in their homes, burned alive, raped, tortured, mutilated. Entire families were wiped out. **For Israelis, this wasn’t just another terrorist attack - it was a trauma that redefined national security forever.**

 Within weeks, the world seemed to move on. The conversation became “stop the war on Gaza"" and ""Condemn Israel"" while Israeli survivors who spoke out were often silenced and dismissed. The shocking brutality of the massacre was barely even emphasized by the UN. 

**This sudden moral whiplash devastated Israeli society - especially leftists** who had their comrades kidnapped and murdered despite many who had long advocated for Palestinian rights. They found themselves abandoned, accused, and demonised instead. 

That emotional fracture will probably never heal, and as a result **this gave Netanyahu more political support as the war continued.** The more the world pressures Israel to cease its military actions without addressing the root issue, the stronger Netanyahu’s position becomes. He uses international condemnation as a political shield as he presents himself as the lone leader of Israel facing the international community's hypocrisy.

  
4. *The hostages are one of the keys to end the war, yet they are either ignored or overshadowed by Palestinian casualties.*

A very common pro-Palestine speaking point is that the Israeli hostages are an afterthought: They're either dead already by ""Israeli bombings"" or not important as there are way more dead Palestinians - However **they are one of the keys to end the war on Gaza as stated by the Israeli public and government.** Besides some strong voices urging for their release, **most of the political pressure was put on Israel instead of dividing them equally between Hamas and Israel.** As a result to this day, Hamas continues to hold the hostages despite suffering greatly on the battlefield. Instead most of the focus and blame went on Israel.

Militarily, Hamas is doomed - they cannot rearm, cannot pay wages to their fighters and they cannot cause any significant casualties to the IDF anymore. If they were pressured both militarily and politically - there's a good chance they would have surrendered already.



*5. The international community missed an historic chance to ally itself with Israelis who oppose Netanyahu.*

Anti-Netanyahu Israelis and the International community have more common interests than they care to admit: They both want the release of the hostages, the end to the war and the ousting of Netanyahu's government. However, many in the international community point to Netanyahu and his government as if they represent all of Israel. Just like addressed in (3), the Israeli public was devestated by the world's one sided response - and this was a huge blunder.

Before this war, Israel was deeply divided - many Israelis were already protesting against Netanyahu’s authoritarian moves, especially after his controversial judicial overhaul in 2023. This wasn't just about foolish politics but a real threat to Israel's democracy. 

When the world condemns Israel as a whole, without acknowledging the internal struggles, i**t ignores those who want to see real change in their government.** This simplistic narrative makes it harder for Israelis fighting for a new government to gain momentum. Netanyahu has used the war as an excuse to silence opposition while framing it as a fight for Israel’s survival. By focusing on him alone, the world is ignoring the broader picture of Israel’s political landscape.

Netanyahu relies on this war to continue - but instead of addressing the root issue of the hostages and Hamas' aggression, it strengthens his stance by grouping the entirety of Israel with him.

And finally, one last thing to point out since we're already here:

  
*6. The voices in Gaza calling for Hamas to surrender are being ignored or outright silenced by the international community.*

Despite the overwhelming international focus on the suffering of Palestinians caused by IDF, there are also voices within Gaza itself calling for an end to Hamas’s rule. On several occasions, protests have broken out in Gaza, with people demanding that Hamas surrender and stop using them as human shields. These protests are often branded as ""anti-Israel"" or ""anti-war"" despite the calls against Hamas. Even so, some prominent protesters were brutally murdered by Hamas in retaliation. 

These calls are rarely covered by mainstream media or, ironically, mentioned by many pro-Palestinian activists who claim to stand for the rights of Palestinian civilians.



To put it all together, This war could’ve ended early - if the world had tipped the first domino. 

That domino was Hamas. Instead, the international community tried its hardest to trip the one behind it - The Israeli government, and in doing so, jammed the whole chain. The result? More death, more destruction, and the survival of the very leaders everyone wanted gone.",DragonfruitSpecial77,422,875,0.6100000143051147,0.2125074946493851,1744914229,/r/changemyview/comments/1k1jw7j/cmv_the_international_community_unironically/,2025,4,changemyview,2025-04-17 18:23:49
1k355md,"CMV: If a person is misled about someone’s age and engages in consensual sex with them, they shouldn’t be charged with any form of sexual assault or rape if they acted in good faith.","I want to present a perspective that I believe is often overlooked, and I’m curious to hear differing opinions.

Let’s say you’re a 21-year-old at a bar, a place where everyone is assumed to be of legal drinking age (21+). You meet someone there, they seem to be around your age, you flirt, and after some time, you both decide to hook up. Later, it turns out that the person you had sex with is underage — let’s say they used a fake ID or somehow misled you into believing they were of legal age.

In this situation, I don’t think the person who engaged in consensual sex should be charged with rape or sexual assault, assuming there was no malicious intent or clear signs of deception from their side. The individual who misrepresented their age is the one at fault, not the person who was misled.

Some points to consider:

Context matters: A bar is an adult venue, and the environment signals that all participants are of legal age. If someone enters that space and behaves like an adult, it’s reasonable to assume they are of age. There’s no obligation for a person to demand birth certificates or additional verification if everything else in the environment suggests they’re dealing with an adult.

Deception is the issue: The primary concern here is deception. If someone is underage and uses a fake ID or lies about their age, they are the ones responsible for the situation. It’s unreasonable to expect a person to be a mind reader and figure out someone's real age based on superficial details.

Personal responsibility: I understand the importance of personal responsibility, but in this case, the responsibility to verify should fall on the person who is actively lying about their age, not the one who is unknowingly misled. It’s not the person who acted in good faith based on the circumstances who should face criminal charges. It’s the one who created the false narrative.


I get that there are emotional and psychological impacts in situations like this, but I believe those impacts don’t justify criminalizing someone for acting based on the information they had at the time. In these cases, the law should focus on punishing the deceiver who used fraudulent means to mislead another person, not the person who was deceived.",ManasJain11,1305,484,0.8799999952316284,0.2111832937617716,1745093430,/r/changemyview/comments/1k355md/cmv_if_a_person_is_misled_about_someones_age_and/,2025,4,changemyview,2025-04-19 20:10:30
1jvpmw6,CMV: The “gifted” programs in the early 2000s did more harm than good for most kids in them.,"I was part of a “gifted and talented” program in elementary and middle school during the late ’90s/early 2000s. At the time, it felt special — we got pulled out of class for enrichment activities, harder material, or independent projects. But looking back, I honestly think it screwed a lot of us up.

It gave kids a false sense of superiority without teaching real-world skills like effort, resilience, or how to fail. We were constantly praised for being “smart” rather than working hard, so when we eventually hit a wall (college, jobs, burnout), we didn’t know how to handle it. A lot of the kids I knew from gifted programs now struggle with anxiety, perfectionism, or a fear of mediocrity.

Meanwhile, it often created unnecessary separation from other students and didn’t actually prepare us for adult life — it just made us better at standardized tests.

I’m not saying all enrichment is bad, but I think the way gifted programs were handled back then set a lot of us up for emotional whiplash.

Change my view.

1kbrkch,CMV: The United States would be a more just and united country today if the Union had imposed draconian punishments on the Confederacy after the Civil War,"This is a follow-up/enhancement to a recent post on this subreddit titled ""CMV: The American Civil War should have ended with mass executions"".  I thought that post was a good start, but I wanted to take the idea even further.  
  
The failure of the Union to decisively dismantle Confederate ideology and power structures after the Civil War was a critical mistake that enabled white supremacist terrorism and regional grievance culture to persist for generations. If the Union had treated the Confederacy as a treasonous insurrection and responded with uncompromising punishment—including executions of leadership, long-term military occupation, land redistribution, and the criminalization of Confederate symbols—then I believe the United States would today be a more socially just, racially equal, and politically united country.

**Context**:  
After the Civil War, the federal government pursued a relatively lenient policy toward the defeated South. Confederate leaders were not executed; many quickly regained political influence. Efforts to protect the rights of freed slaves during Reconstruction were eventually abandoned. This led to the rise of the ""Lost Cause"" mythology, the creation of Jim Crow laws, and racial terror groups like the KKK. Confederate monuments were erected decades later, and even today, states fly Confederate flags and debate whether the Civil War was ""about states' rights.""

I think all of this could have been prevented—or at least severely limited—if the federal government had acted more decisively in the 1860s and 70s.

**My Argument**:

If the Union had enacted a policy of **total dismantling** of the Confederacy—not just in terms of military defeat, but cultural, political, and economic erasure—the following benefits would likely have emerged:

1. **Abolition of Confederate Identity**:
   * Confederate leaders like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee could have been publicly tried and executed for treason.
   * Confederate flags, monuments, and songs could have been banned by federal law.
   * Southern schools and churches would be required to teach a pro-Union, anti-slavery narrative—preventing the Lost Cause myth from ever taking root.
2. **Lasting Protection of Black Civil Rights**:
   * A prolonged military occupation (20–30 years) could have kept Black voters, landowners, and politicians safe.
   * Land formerly owned by slaveholders could have been redistributed to freedmen.
   * A Black political class might have firmly taken root, with long-term representation at all levels of government.
3. **Economic Restructuring**:
   * Plantation landowners could have been dispossessed and barred from regaining political or economic power.
   * Northern industry and capital could have modernized the South with infrastructure and industry under federal control.
   * The region’s economy might have been diversified away from white-dominated agriculture much earlier.
4. **Suppression of White Supremacist Movements**:
   * Early iterations of the KKK and similar groups could have been ruthlessly dismantled by federal troops with legal authority.
   * Sympathy for such groups would be viewed socially and legally as treasonous rather than defensible under ""heritage.""
5. **Long-Term National Unity**:
   * The regional divide that still influences U.S. politics might have faded with a clearer victory and forced ideological realignment.
   * Racial grievance and Southern exceptionalism would be stigmatized and discredited early.

**Anticipated Counterarguments** (feel free to challenge these):

* “That level of punishment would’ve caused long-term insurgency.” → Possibly, but the South was already devastated; firm occupation could have prevented armed uprisings more effectively than leniency did.
* “You can’t force ideological change through punishment.” → Post-WWII Germany and Japan suggest otherwise—firm restructuring paired with education and democratization *can* work.
* “That would’ve been authoritarian and un-American.” → The Confederacy waged war to preserve slavery. The response needed to be just as morally clear and uncompromising.

**Change My View**:  
I'm open to hearing why this path would not have led to a better America. Would it have backfired long-term? Are there moral or practical limits to federal authority, even in the wake of treason? Would another approach have been more effective?

I keep seeing these naturalists pushing herbs, oils, and “remedies” as a cure for everything — but back then, people used these “remedies” and  died young from infections, childbirth, and simple injuries. There were no antibiotics, no sterile surgeries, no trauma care. Nature was brutal back then. 

Now that we finally have the tools to fight diseases — yes, even if they’re “unnatural” — people suddenly want to throw it all away and go back to herbs? This is exactly how Steve Jobs died. He refused surgery for something treatable and chose the “natural” route — and it cost him his life.

Social media doesn’t help either. You see all these clean, aesthetic posts advertising herbal remedies with dramatic testimonials, and people fall for it. Science can actually isolate the one helpful compound in a plant and make it 100x more consistent and effective.

1jpspeh,CMV: Nintendo’s 50% price hikes for their games will bite them,"Nintendo just announced that the new Switch 2 will release on June 5th. Alongside that, the new Mario kart got announced and it was revealed that they are following a new pricing model- 

https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/

$80 for digital copies of this game, and $90 for physical copies. 

For non-gamers, Nintendo switch games cost $60 for physical and digital copies currently. I do not believe that such price increases will be well received by the gaming marketplace where price sensitivity is already a major issue these days, an effective 50% increase in prices will be detrimental to adoption of their new console.

3. Robots don't have thumbs and while they can do alot of things in manufacturing, there are a ton of things on the assembly line that still require thumbs. So we are talking about humans doing manual, repetitive, at times dangerous jobs.

1jswzwu,CMV: Refusing to acknowledge female privilege weakens feminism's moral consistency,"**The View:** This post refines and expands on a previous CMV that argued feminism must allow space for men to explore their gendered oppression - or risk reinforcing patriarchal norms. Many thoughtful responses raised important questions about how privilege is defined and applied asymmetrically across genders.

I believe in intersectional feminism. Feminism itself is not just a social movement but a political and moral ideology - like socialism or capitalism - that has historically led the way in making society fairer. But to maintain its moral authority, feminism must be willing to apply its analytical tools consistently. That includes recognizing when women benefit from gendered expectations, not just when they suffer under them.

To be clear from the start: This is not a claim that men have it worse than women overall. Women remain disadvantaged in many structural and historical ways. But the gendered harms men face—and the benefits women sometimes receive—also deserve honest scrutiny. In this post, ""female privilege"" refers to context-specific social, psychological, and sometimes institutional advantages that women receive as a byproduct of gendered expectations, which are often overlooked in mainstream feminist discourse.

Feminist literature often resists acknowledging female privilege. Mainstream theory frames any advantages women receive as forms of ""benevolent sexism"" - that is, socially rewarded traits like vulnerability, emotional expression, or caregiving, which are ultimately tools of subordination. Yet this interpretation becomes problematic when such traits offer real advantages in practical domains like education, employment, or criminal sentencing.

Some feminist thinkers, including Cathy Young and Caitlin Moran, have argued that feminism must do more to acknowledge areas where women may hold social or psychological advantage. Young writes that many feminists ""balk at any pro-equality advocacy that would support men in male-female disputes or undermine female advantage."" Moran warns that if feminism fails to “show up for boys,” others will exploit that silence.

To be clear, I’m not arguing that men- or anyone - should be treated as permanent victims. But anyone, of any gender, can be victimized in specific social contexts. When these patterns are widespread and sustained, they constitute systemic disadvantage. And if one gender avoids those harms, that’s what we should honestly call privilege.

Michael Kimmel observed: “Privilege is invisible to those who have it.” This applies to all identities - including women. As feminists often note, when you're used to privilege, equality can feel like oppression. That same logic now needs to apply where women hold gendered advantages. Failing to acknowledge these asymmetries doesn’t challenge patriarchal gender roles - it reinforces them, especially through the infantilizing gender role of women as delicate or less accountable. This narrative preserves women’s moral innocence while framing men’s suffering as self-inflicted.

Feminism has given us powerful tools to understand how gender norms harm individuals and shape institutions, and it carries with it a claim to moral responsibility for dismantling those harms wherever they appear. But to remain morally and intellectually coherent, feminism must apply those tools consistently. That means acknowledging that female privilege exists - at least in specific, situational domains.

This isn’t a call to equate women’s disadvantages with men’s, or to paint men - or anyone - as permanent victims. Rather, it’s to say that anyone of any gender can be victimized in certain contexts. And when those patterns are widespread enough, they constitute systemic oppression - and their inverse is privilege. If men’s disadvantages can be systemic, so too are women’s advantages. Calling those advantages “benevolent sexism” without acknowledging their real-world impact avoids accountability.

**What Is Privilege, Really?** Feminist theory generally defines privilege as systemic, institutional, and historically entrenched. But in practice, privilege operates across multiple domains:

* **Structural privilege** \- Legal and institutional advantages, such as exemption from military drafts, more lenient sentencing, or gendered expectations in employment sectors.
* **Social privilege** \-  The ability to navigate society with favorable expectations: being assumed emotionally available, having greater access to supportive peer networks, or being encouraged to express emotion without stigma. For example, women are more likely to be offered help when in distress, or to receive community support in personal crises.
* **Psychological privilege**  \- Deep-seated assumptions about innocence, moral authority, or trustworthiness. This includes cultural reflexes to believe women’s accounts of events more readily than men’s, or to assume women act from good intentions, even when causing harm. Studies show women are viewed as more honest—even when they lie—impacting credibility in disputes and conflict resolution.

Feminist theory critiques male privilege across all three. But when women benefit from gender norms, these advantages are often reframed as “benevolent sexism” - a byproduct of patriarchal control. This framing creates an inconsistency:

* If male privilege is “unearned advantage rooted in patriarchy,”
* And female privilege is “benevolent sexism” that also confers real advantage, also unearned, and also rooted in patriarchy—
* Then why not recognize both as gendered privilege?

If female privilege is “benevolent sexism,” should male privilege be called “callous sexism”? Both reward conformity to traditional gender roles. Why the rhetorical asymmetry?

**Structural Privilege: Who Really Has It?** Feminist analysis often responds by saying women don't have privilege because men have structural privilege. But how widespread is this in reality?

|Domain|Feminist Claim|What It Shows|Counterpoint / Nuance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Political Representation|Men dominate government leadership|Men hold most top positions|Laws still restrict men (e.g., military draft) and women (e.g., abortion rights)|
|Corporate Leadership|Men dominate elite business roles|<1% of men are CEOs|Most men are workers, not beneficiaries of corporate power|
|Legal System|Law favors male interests|Men face 37% longer sentences for same crimes|Harsh sentencing tied to male-coded behavioral expectations|
|Wealth and Wages|Men earn more|Wage gaps persist in high-status roles|Gaps shaped by risk, overtime, occupation, and choice|
|Military & Draft|Men dominate military|Men make up 97% of combat deaths and all draftees|Gendered sacrifice is not privilege|
|Workforce Representation|Women underrepresented in STEM|Some jobs skew male (STEM, construction)|Others skew female (teaching, childcare), where men face social barriers|

This shows that structural power exists - but it doesn’t equate to universal male benefit. Most men do not control institutions; they serve them. While elites shape the system, the burdens are widely distributed - and many fall disproportionately on men. Many of the disparities attributed to patriarchy may actually stem from capitalism. Yet mainstream feminism often conflates the two, identifying male dominance in elite capitalist roles as proof of patriarchal benefit - while ignoring how few men ever access that power.

**Under Acknowledged Female Privilege (Social and Psychological):**

* **Victimhood Bias:** Women are more likely to be believed in abuse or harassment cases. Male victims - especially of psychological abuse - often face disbelief or mockery (Hine et al., 2022).
* **Emotional Expression:** Women are socially permitted to express vulnerability and seek help. Men are expected to be stoic - contributing to untreated trauma and higher suicide rates. bell hooks wrote that “patriarchy harms men too.” Most feminists agree. But it often goes unstated that patriarchy harms men in ways it does not harm women. That asymmetry defines privilege.
* **Presumption of Trust:** A 2010 TIME report found women are perceived as more truthful - even when lying. This grants them greater social trust in caregiving, teaching, and emotional roles. Men in these contexts face suspicion or stigma.
* **Cultural Infantilization:** Female wrongdoing is often excused as stress or immaturity; male wrongdoing is condemned. Hine et al. (2022) found male victims of psychological abuse are dismissed, while female perpetrators are infantilized. Women’s gender roles portray them as weaker or more in need of protection, which grants leniency. Men’s gender roles portray them as strong and stoic, which diminishes empathy. The advantages that men may have historically enjoyed - such as being seen as more competent - are rightly now being shared more equally. But many advantages women receive, such as trust and emotional support, are not. This asymmetry is increasingly visible.

**Why This Inconsistency Matters:**

* It originates in academic framing. Much of feminist literature avoids acknowledging female privilege in any domain. This theoretical omission trickles down into mainstream discourse, where it gets simplified into a binary: women as oppressed, men as oppressors. As a result, many discussions default to moral asymmetry rather than mutual accountability.
* It alienates potential allies. Men who engage with feminism in good faith are often told their pain is self-inflicted or a derailment. This reinforces the binary, turning sincere engagement into perceived threat. By doing this, we implicitly accept ""callous sexism"" toward men and boys as normal. This invites disengagement and resentment - not progress.
* It erodes feminist credibility. When feminism cannot acknowledge obvious social asymmetries—like differential sentencing, emotional expressiveness, or assumptions of innocence - it appears selective rather than principled. This weakens its claim to moral leadership.
* It creates a messaging vacuum. Feminism’s silence on women’s privilege - often the inverse of men’s disadvantage - creates a void that populist influencers exploit. The Guardian (April 2025) warns that misogynistic and Franco-nostalgic views among young Spanish men are spreading - precisely because no trusted mainstream discourse offers space to address male hardship in good faith.  No trusted space to talk about male identity or hardship in a fair, nuanced way, is leading boys to discuss it in the only spaces where such discussion was welcome - in misogynist and ultimately far-right conversations.
* It encourages rhetorical shut-downs. My previous post raised how sexual violence—undeniably serious—is sometimes invoked not to inform but to silence. It becomes a moral trump card that ends conversations about male suffering or female privilege. When areas women need to work on are always secondary, and female advantages seem invisible, it is hard to have a fair conversation about gender.

**Anticipated Objections:**

* **“Men cannot experience sexism.”** Only true if we define sexism as structural oppression - and even that is contested above. Men face widespread gendered bias socially and psychologically. If those patterns are systematic and harmful, they meet the same criteria we apply to sexism elsewhere.
* **“Female privilege is just disguised sexism.”** Possibly. But then male privilege is too. Let’s be consistent.
* **“Women are worse off overall.”** In many structural areas, yes. But that doesn’t erase advantages in others.

**The manosphere is not the root cause of something - it is a symptom.** Across the globe, there is growing sentiment among young men that feminism has “gone too far.” This is usually blamed on right-wing algorithms. But many of these young men, unable to articulate their experiences in feminist terms and excluded from feminist spaces where they could learn to do so, are simply responding to a perceived double standard and finding places where they are allowed to talk about it. They feel injustice - but in progressive spaces are told it is their own bias. This double standard may be what fuels backlash against feminism and left wing messaging.

**Conclusion:** Feminism doesn’t need to center men or their issues. But if it wants to retain moral authority and intellectual coherence, it must be willing to name all forms of gendered advantage - not just the ones that negatively affect women. Recognizing structural, social, and psychological female privilege does not deny women’s oppression. It simply makes feminism a more honest, inclusive, and effective framework-  one capable of addressing the full complexity of gender in the 21st century.

1k61g2h,CMV: Pickup Trucks are (Almost) Entirely Pointless,"I live in the western United States, where pickup trucks are king. From my perspective trucks, particularly full-size and midsize trucks (which are the size of full-sized trucks of a few years ago) are almost entirely pointless other than for play-acting, and that a van (I mean a real van like a sprinter or a ford e-series) is better in almost every case. I will start with the exceptions:  


1. Stinky or dirty cargo. If you have a business picking up dog poop, by all means use a pickup truck. That said you probably don't need a full size, a maverick would hold a prodigious amount of poo. 

2. Quick or special-purpose loading: if you are throwing in trash bags, throwing out bales of hay, or getting a load of rocks from a tractor, sur, a truck makes sense. 

3. (Mildly) Large Cargo: there are some instances where something is too large to fit in a van but will fit in a pickup truck bed. Something like a small tree, or something that barely sticks out of the bed. Of course, if it is too big it will just fall out, notwithstanding efforts to tie it down. 

4. Towing a fifth-wheel: No argument here. You have to have a pickup truck for that. Of course, you ruin your bed, so that is basically a dedicated tow vehicle.  

Other than these exceptions, a van clearly dominates. Your cargo is more secure from theft, safe from weather and less likely to fall out or need to be tied down. You also have a far more versatile vehicle that can be used to travel the country in comfort, camped in, etc. The existence of shells for trucks basically show that people really wanted a van, but decided to make one themselves rather than just buy one.

Overall, I think people mostly buy pickup trucks for two reasons:

1. Big = good.

2. Play-acting. Pickup trucks can be used to tow, haul, and off road. One day I may want to pretend that I will do one of those things.

  
All of this said, I know the that the truck is deeply ingrained in the American psyche. Despite feeling this way, I have considered buying one several times (gotta love cognitive dissonance.). Maybe I am missing something. CMV.

They suggest many minorities are receiving career opportunities largely not based upon merit but primarily due to their minority status.

1jzxel2,CMV: MAGA and the new conservative movement that grew from Trump will fracture and die with him,"I don’t think the MAGA movement survives Donald Trump.

Not in the form it exists today, anyway. Trump didn’t just ride a wave of conservative populism, he became the wave. What we now call MAGA isn’t built on a platform or a coherent ideology. It’s built around a man. When he’s gone, politically, physically, or otherwise, I think what’s left will split, fracture, and ultimately lose most of the energy that made it so dominant.

The reason I say this is because, to me, MAGA is less of a movement and more of a cult of personality. Trump provided something the American far-right hadn’t had in a long time: a charismatic figurehead willing to be as loud, unfiltered, and combative as they are. He validated and amplified the angriest corners of the conservative base, the folks who for years felt ignored or dismissed by traditional Republicans. But I don’t see anyone else in his orbit who commands that same visceral loyalty. Ron DeSantis, JD Vance, Nikki Haley, they’re all trying to echo Trump’s style, but none have his draw. Without him at the center, the movement loses its gravitational pull.

I think we’ll see a power vacuum emerge when Trump is no longer politically viable. And history shows us that these types of vacuums rarely end with a smooth transfer of influence. Movements that are too centered on one figure often fall apart when that figure exits. Think of Ross Perot and the Reform Party, or even what happened to Perónism in Argentina after Juan Perón died. The infrastructure might remain, but the energy and direction falter.

I also think there’s a deep split coming, one that already exists beneath the surface, between the wealthy class of MAGA supporters and the working-class base. The rich Trump-aligned figures, the political insiders, donors, and media moguls, are in it because his presidency was good for their business or their access. They’ll move on and try to back whoever keeps the cash flowing or the tax breaks coming. But the working-class voters who saw Trump as their voice? I don’t think they ever really got what they wanted out of him. They got attention, but not much meaningful policy. Without Trump himself feeding that sense of rebellion and grievance, I suspect that wing of the movement will struggle to remain relevant, or at least unified.

So my view is that once Trump is gone, MAGA as we know it collapses. It might rebrand or morph into something else, but the current iteration will die without its central figure.

Change my view. I’m open to arguments that someone else could credibly take up the mantle, or that the ideology is strong enough on its own to outlive him. But to me, it feels like this movement lives and dies with Donald Trump.",superdino1234,1199,303,0.8500000238418579,0.165590007283824,1744737271,/r/changemyview/comments/1jzxel2/cmv_maga_and_the_new_conservative_movement_that/,2025,4,changemyview,2025-04-15 17:14:31
1k5upf0,"CMV: Trump's tarrif war isn't stupidity or incompetence, he wants to tank the dollar.","1) Doge extracts 2+ trillion from the fed as a tax break for the rich. Meanwhile Trump and his inner circle are using his tarrif war to pump the economy for bill/trillion more (it's hard to know how much but they all start investing with 10-100s billions so they can get to trill faster than any of us). They're amassing capital. 
2)Trump said on day one he wanted to declare martial law, and signed EOs to get that ball rolling (something about immigrants). He cut USAID, farmers started posting videos about losing their farms because it was subsidizing many of them. He assaults immigrants,  farmers started  posting videos about not being able to run their farms. He enacted tarrifs and farmers posted videos about not being able to supply their farms. Farmers are losing their farms, that sounds like a food shortage this winter.  And that's just the kind of ""emergency "" Trump needs to declare that sweet, sweet  martial law. So he'll let it happen, who cares if the left calls him stupid for not seeing it coming.
3) They've been warning us for decades the dollar would fail, and in recent years sooner rather than later. Trump has antagonized Canada and Greenland with annexation, rewrote who was the aggressor in Ukraine and described the EU as designed to screw the US. No one trusts us. Noone wants to invest in us or buy our debt and they're starting to worry about using our currency, the default currency (or whatever it's called). Combine that with food shortages and unrest at home and that sounds to me like a recipe for how the dollar, already  struggling, finally fails.
4) At this point, with no currency, the US would  be bankrupt.  Banks get involved, you know, the banking system everyone loves and trusts and always have.  Can you think of anyone ( see point 1) who might, recently, have acquired the capital nessassary to pay the banks? Should an entity (maybe a real estate mogul) purchase the property south of Canada and north of Mexico it would become theirs. They wouldn't be any more beholden to the constitution than someone buying an abandoned factory is to the business that originally built it.  Trump, who operates his businesses this way, would then be free to reconstitute it as his personal corporate dictatorship (he said term 1 day 1 he wanted to be a dictator and has said he'd prefer to run the country like a business).  And while international law may have something to say about our fate, does Trump seem like someone who thinks he's answerable to the international community?

----I'm gonna wander a bit off topic here, this next bit is just for ""the lefties"". The above bit, though. I genuinely want you to change my view.----


If Trump (& the Heritage Foundation) is the wannabe tyrant it seems like he wants to be.
A) A ""food shortage"" is an effective way to hold an entire population down. I'd expect it to continue. Also, power and communications black outs, ""due to the food riots "". A good excuse to send troops after his enemies? Maybe relocate people to places ""he can supply food and power to"" (the US has done it before)? While he's saving us. I'd figure communications would return quickly enough, but only things propaganda compatible would be allowed. (I'm thinking about how they say TV is in China, N Korea, etc)

B) The mid terms will be too late. What few patriots are left in government need to know  if they move to incarcerate Trump and the heritage foundation loyalist we will be there in large enough number to prevent another Jan 6. They can't act if we aren't there to protect them and prove, once and for all, that trump's will isn't the will of the patriotic United States of America! 

Time is running out. We all have to come out. This isn't politics as usual. This year we may well decide if self governance was too hard. If we fundamentally believe in freedom, liberty and happiness for all, or if we feel like the great American experiment was a failure. It wasn't. call every elected and appointed official you can as offen as you can and TELL THEM! Show up at every protest you can. Go to your town halls. Ask the 60's, it works!

For any ""righties"" who made it this far, if you believe in the constitutional USA (and I think, deep down, even the angriest of you do), I hope you guys understand everyone over here is just worried the same corporations that corrupted our (our) system of government are finally making their move.  It's not really about Trump specifically,  we just think he's in on it. We may disagree about things, but in this system we each get to celebrate our sides victories or plan to win the other side over next time. The greatest victory is converting your opponent. And for the petty among us all, you get to poke at the other side like an a.. and no one  can really stop you.( But if you start it they can preach back at you, fairs fair, ;) )  

Listen,  if we're wrong we'll eat crow( I'll get seconds for this) and we'll all have a laugh about how worked up social media got us. If we're right we're all going to suffer.

Do you want to risk, for you and you family (eye rolling emoji here), a life where you could be ""repositioned"" to whatever ""department"" or ""facility"" malcontents end up at?

1kbmvjo,CMV:  Protesting against Hamas will help Palestinian civilians more than protesting against Israel,"Unless you have been in a coma the last two-and-a-half years, you have witnessed a great number of Pro-Palestine activists protesting against the Israeli response to the Hamas attack on October 7^(th), condemning the loss of civilian lives in Gaza. 

 I agree, it is horrific.  Not only the loss of life, but the starvation and destruction as well.

Before I continue, please do me the favor of writing your answers down to these “Yes/No” questions on a piece of paper.  Please feel free to elaborate.  
  
1) Was Hamas justified in what it did on October 7^(th)? 

2)  Is the Israeli response justified?

3)  Should the Israeli response be considered a genocide?

4)  Were the Jews right to accept the land from the British in 1948?

5)  Were the Arabs right to declare war on the Jews in 1948?

6)  Were the Jews right to keep the land they won in the 1948 war?

7)  Was Israel right to keep the land it won in the 1967 war?

8)  Does the fact that Israeli forces left Gaza 20 years ago, only to be followed up immediately with attacks from Hamas justify the Israeli response?

9)  Does the fact that Israel still had control of the borders justify the Palestinian response?

10)  Are the Palestinians being held in Israeli jails being held unjustly?

11)  Should Israel let more aid into Gaza?

 Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions.

 

Please carefully read your answers and neatly fold up the piece of paper you used.

 Now throw it in the trash.

 Why am I asking you to throw your heartfelt opinions in the trash?  Because it doesn’t matter!  None of that is relevant at all!

**Rightly or wrongly**, it appears Israel will keep going until they get their hostages back.  Palestinian civilians will continue to be killed until Israel gets their hostages back from Hamas.

 

Protesting against Israel for two-and-a-half years has not helped stop the killing of Palestinians. 

Have these protestors really missed that single very important fact?

They have been protesting against Israel for two-and-a-half years and Palestinians are still being killed.

 

So why keep doing that instead of trying something different that might actually SAVE PALESTINIAN LIVES? 

I personally would suggest trying something different.

 

I would try protesting against Hamas and try to get them to release the hostages.  That WOULD actually help stop the killing of Palestinians.

 

I am not going to pick sides because both sides have done enough crap.  At this point it doesn’t matter who started it, who’s right, and who’s wrong.  If we want to save Palestinian lives we need to try something different, and try to get the hostages released so we can end this insanity.

 I know it’s much more popular to protest against Israel as opposed to protesting against Hamas, but please consider the Palestinian civilians and Palestinian children.  Will you continue to do what is popular, but not helping?  Or will you risk being unpopular, and protest against Hamas in an attempt to save Palestinian lives?

 

Of course if you want to continue protesting Israel please do.  I’m not saying it hurts.  But please consider protesting against Hamas.

 

Yes I know that releasing the hostages will not cure everything, and it will not totally stop the bloodshed in the region.  I’m not that naïve.  But it will at least help, and at least save some Palestinian lives.

 

That’s what I’m hoping for.

We require immigrants to pass exams to become citizens. We expect doctors, lawyers, teachers—even hairstylists—to meet strict licensing and educational standards. But the person leading 330+ million people who also has an effect on the rest of the entire globe? No required knowledge of law, ethics, economics, history, or leadership. Nothing.

And on top of that, the system allows for billionaires and corporate donors to essentially manufacture a candidate’s rise through advertising, algorithm manipulation, and mass influence. Some even control voting infrastructure. A person doesn’t need to be competent—they just need to be loud, famous, and backed by the right people.

The Constitution is supposed to protect us from tyranny and instability. Shouldn’t that also mean protecting us from electing people who are clearly unqualified or emotionally volatile?

We should be able to expect any president to meet a basic standard of emotional maturity, legal knowledge, and leadership ability—no matter what party they’re from.",PoolShotTom,938,385,0.8999999761581421,0.1592425496555162,1744894013,/r/changemyview/comments/1k1bx02/cmv_we_should_have_additional_qualifications_to/,2025,4,changemyview,2025-04-17 12:46:53
1jsk3jm,CMV: There is no valid proof of God's existence,"I have evaluated the various arguments presented by religious individuals as ""proofs"" of God, but none of these are valid from a logical or verifiability standpoint.

I invite you to present what you think are valid proofs of God's existence.

I define ""valid"" (logically) as: Where the premises are true, and the conclusion follows from those premises. In other words, the conclusion must be derived from the premises.

I'll give you an example of one of the many proofs that don't follow logic and are logical fallacies:  
**God is the First Cause.**

Let me clarify why I won't consider it:

1. **If God is a literal synonym for the First Cause**, then the First Cause is a synonym for God, and these terms can be interchanged. This doesn't hold, because the First Cause, by definition, doesn't have the characteristics associated with God in various religions. Therefore, God, as understood in religions, is not proven to exist since all the other aspects that make up the figure of God, and on which various moral rules and dogmas are based, are not proven.
2. **If God is the First Cause, but not a synonym**, meaning God has the First Cause as one of His characteristics, then it's not proof. It doesn't prove God's existence with His various characteristics; it simply states that, since God is the beginning of everything, omnipotent, etc., He is the First Cause. And while it might make sense that there could be a First Cause of all things, the association of the other characteristics of God with the First Cause has not been proven.

To simplify, let's define these two terms:

* **First Cause:** The first cause without any additional connotations.
* **God:** The First Cause with the other characteristics associated with the figure of God in religions.

The reasoning that is often used is: If John (God) is a president (First Cause), and we are able to contact a president (First Cause), then it must be John (God).

Here’s another example: If it rains (God) when there are clouds (First Cause), then whenever there are clouds (First Cause), it must rain (God). But we all know that clouds can exist without necessarily leading to rain.

These two examples are **illogical**, **because the premises may be true, but they do not lead to a conclusion that can be derived from the premises**.

I look forward to your comments.",Panshra,0,781,0.4900000095367431,0.1567643516659976,1743906877,/r/changemyview/comments/1jsk3jm/cmv_there_is_no_valid_proof_of_gods_existence/,2025,4,changemyview,2025-04-06 02:34:37
1jyjjr1,CMV: Men who are 30+ yrs old but like teenage  girls only do so for control.,"There’s no “real love” between a teenager and someone in their 30s. Full grown men should not want teenage girls because they’re at extremely different stages of life. The lack of life experience makes teens more immature and naive compared to older women so there’s 0 reason to go after them unless you’re looking for someone to control because older women would have had enough life experience to know what to do and not deal with any BS from such guys. These guys also are just extremely immature so they go after young girls to match their level of immaturity. I’m 17 and can’t even look at 14 yr olds in such ways so it’s just gross how some dudes aged 30+ do it. Even if she’s 18 it’s still so wrong because she’s still in HS or has just gotten out of HS she still hasn’t gotten the time to experience life. I’ve heard of stories where old guys and a teenager have “fallen in love” but really? Really?! Is it actually love?? Maybe for the teenager but the guy? I highly doubt he loves her, he only loves the power he has over her. Theres significant power imbalance in relationships like this because the young girl would be extremely dependent on the guy for guidance and resources since he’s so much more older than her.

1ky5bcm,CMV: It is high time we stop normalising islamism.,"We’ve had this discussion before, and I still stand by it, more strongly than ever: it’s high time we stop normalizing Islamism and start calling it what it is — a regressive, authoritarian ideology that stands in direct opposition to liberal democracy, secular values, and individual rights.

Let’s be clear. From systemic homophobia and deeply ingrained misogyny, to apologia for child marriage, terrorism, and ambitions for a global caliphate that would erase pluralism and national sovereignty — these are not fringe elements in Islamist discourse. They are core tenets. They are preached openly in mosques, embedded in school curricula in some countries, and often tolerated or downplayed in diaspora communities. These views are not “extreme” by accident — they stem from the fusion of politics with literalist religion.

And yet, somehow, in a grotesque twist of moral confusion, the Western liberal establishment continues to protect and even promote these ideologies under the banner of tolerance, multiculturalism, and inclusion. Left-liberals, who claim to stand for women’s rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and secular governance, suddenly become apologists when the violators of these principles cloak themselves in the garb of “minority rights.”

This selective outrage, this refusal to apply liberal principles universally, is not compassion — it is cowardice. It is betrayal. It’s a compromise of core democratic values in exchange for votes, virtue-signaling, and a hollow sense of moral superiority.

We must stop conflating criticism of Islamism with racism or bigotry. Islamism is not a race. It’s a political ideology — and like fascism or any other form of totalitarianism, it must be rejected outright, not coddled. Enough with the double standards. Enough with letting clerics who call for stoning or apostasy laws be treated as “community leaders.” Enough with allowing veiled theocracy to parade around as culture.

If someone openly supports Islamism, they are not simply expressing an opinion — they are rejecting democracy, secularism, and basic human rights. And they should be treated accordingly: with moral condemnation, not validation.

This is not a call for oppression. It is a call for clarity. Tolerance ends where intolerance begins. A liberal democracy cannot survive by embracing the very ideologies that seek to destroy it from within.",Middle_Exercise_1549,2710,2266,0.7599999904632568,0.6931823762433106,1748506300,/r/changemyview/comments/1ky5bcm/cmv_it_is_high_time_we_stop_normalising_islamism/,2025,5,changemyview,2025-05-29 08:11:40
1krvvrf,CMV: There is no realistic path to dismantling Israel as a Jewish state,"I rarely discuss Israel/Palestine. Made the mistake of trying to have a conversation in a thread full of people shouting 'Dismantle Israel' in a news sub and got permabanned. Feel free to check my comment history.

I understand it's a topic many people are passionate about, but so much of the 'discussion' is just screaming, with zero solutions that aren't just genocide. I am, sincerely, not seeing a realistic path forward where Israel is dismantled or radically reformed by outside forces. It's not like South Africa, where whites were a small minority ruling over a large majority of black people, and political and economic pressures were enough to eventually force a free election. It was a fragile, minority rule system to start with. But in Israel, right now, the population is ~75% Jewish. Even if we imagine adding the Palestinians of Gaza to the population, Jews will still be a majority. A free election in a combined Israel & Palestine would still look pretty close to what's already in place. Like what's the plan here? Because 'Two state solution' obviously is not what a lot of pro-Palestinian people have in mind. Not among protestors, and most definitely not on reddit. There is a very strong sentiment that Israel should just cease to be, rarely making any mention of what should happen to the people there.

You can't take the vote away from the Jews, because if you do, Hamas or something like it will win, and their *explicit* goals are to murder the entirety of the Jewish people in the region. Just look at the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund. The Gaza government loudly and openly paid the families of any muslim who murdered any Jew in Israel *for any reason*. Life in Gaza is abject misery right now, and half the population is *still* supporting the October 7th attacks. What exactly do people think will happen if the Palestinians are allowed to decide what happens to the Jews in Israel? That would just be an even bigger bloodbath than the current war.

So... what's the alternative? Expelling all the Jews? And send them where, exactly? Many of them are the children or grandchildren of Jews who were expelled from other Arab countries in the 20th century. You think sending them back to dictatorships that confiscated all their grandpa's property and kicked them out already is a good idea? No? Alright, you think we can find a country willing to take in 7 million Jews? No? Alright, should we forcibly split them up and guard to make sure they are only ever a small minority wherever they go? That hasn't worked out great, historically. Help me see a realistic solution here, people. I'm not condoning the actions of the IDF or the current Israeli government, but you have to be *for* something. You can't just shout ""From the River to the Sea"" and pretend 7 million Jews will just go away. Give me a sane, realistic path forward that doesn't devolve into a second holocaust.

1kzv1tu,"CMV: Out of all the groups that immigrate to western countries, Muslim Arabs are hands down the worst at assimilating to western standards","I am saying this as an Exmuslim Arab myself and yes, I know there’s exceptions. I know they’re not all that way. But the painting is on the wall. I’m not saying anyone should abandon their religion, but integration is very important when you are moving to a new country. 

The reason why immigrants coming from let’s say Mexico or Latin America integrate so well is because western cultures aren’t that different and share similar values. The differences between traditional Islamic Arab culture and western culture are so astronomically different that conflict usually arises. Europe's weak stance on who they let in from the Middle East proves this, just look at Birmingham or at Malmo. 

People say ""racism"" and “Islamophobia” very loosely. If people are coming to your home country(pick many of the EU), causing chaos, pushing their own beliefs, killings, getting benefits from a western nation, etc. of course people are going to start getting pissed off. 

Muslim Arabs originally born in the Middle East are used to their thoughts and values being the majority. They get a little confused in melting pot western cultures where they encounter a lot of people with different views. They’re so indoctrinated to think one way that assimilation is nearly impossible. Try going and be a raging Christian in Saudi Arabia, wouldn’t work. You would have to assimilate. 

What you worship or your religion is your business, but to move to a new western nation and expect to force the laws and beliefs of your former nation is just peak disrespect. European countries shouldn’t have ‘no go zones’ because some immigrants refuse to adopt the host country's culture and values.

1kh3uxt,CMV: The far left is very effective at driving average people towards the right.,"Now when I say far left, I should clarify that I'm not talking about economic issues like wealth disparity. Those actually matter and are responsible for 99% of the problems the average person faces. Unfortunately the average person can't make the connection that someone else's life of ease/luxury costs them personally.

What people do seem to care about a lot are the social/cultural issues and that's where I think the left makes the most mistakes. Every argument I see is so hostile and emotional when it comes to these social issues that people who were otherwise middle of the road are pushed right. You can't agree with just 90% of the issue, if you don't agree with that remaining 10%, you're labeled a something-phobe and considered a target for cancellation. Obviously the right makes use of this, because it's really easy to point out how extremist that group is being. What were otherwise average people just end up voting against the group that attacks them.

One really good example of this is Reddit. This website censors a lot of social/cultural debate that's not biased towards the left. It's why a lot of topics are banned on a variety of subreddits.

Unfortunately, she was a victim of her own pride and continued to sit on the bench, ultimately receiving 3 more cancer diagnoses (5 total) before her death in 2020. Her refusal to step away when Obama was in office enabled Trump to skew the court 6-3, and has resulted in multiple decisions that have since undone many of her accomplishments.

“A button appears in front of you. If you press it, a million dollars will be deposited in your bank account. But a random person on the planet will die instantly.”

There are no drawbacks. No “black mirror” shenanigans. The IRS or whatever won’t get suspicious. What would you do?

I believe that 99% of people, me included, will press that button.

Yes, it’s evil. Yes, it’s selfish. But I have my reasons.

First of all, the vast majority of people would put themselves and their families above strangers. 

I’m not poor, but a million dollars would still get rid of like 95% the of the stress in my life. 

For a financially struggling person, it would literally change their entire life. 

Sorry random stranger, but I value my life over yours.

Second of all, there’s the cognitive dissonance involved.

You simply press a button and get your money. You don’t know who died, you didn’t see them die, you can’t even really confirm if anyone actually died. It’s entirely different than someone handing you a knife and having to actually get your hands dirty.

It’s similar to why non vegans don’t feel guilty when eating meat or other animal products. But most will if they had to kill an animal personally.

I guess the moral of the story is that money talks, and very few people are incorruptible .

1ki79g9,"CMV: Universities are not making students liberal. The ""blame"" belongs with conservative culture downplaying the importance of higher education.","If you want to prove that Universities are somehow *making* students liberal, the best way to demonstrate that would be to measure the political alignment of Freshmen, then measure the political alignment of Seniors, and see if those alignments shifted at all over the course of their collegiate career. THAT is the most definitive evidence to suggest that Universities are somehow spreading ""leftist"" or ""left-wing"" ideology of some kind. And to my knowledge, this shift is not observed anywhere.

But yeah, ultimately this take that Universities are shifting students to the left has always kind of mystified me. Granted, I went to undergrad for engineering school, but between being taught how to evaluate a triple integral, how to calculate the stress in a steel beam, how to report the temperature at (x,y,z) with a heat source 10 inches away, I guess I must have missed where my ""liberal indoctrination"" must have occurred. A pretty similar story could be told for all sorts of other professions. And the only fields of study that are decidedly liberal are probably pursued largely by people who made up their minds on what they wanted to study well before they even started at their University.

Simply put, never have I met a new college freshman who was decidedly conservative in his politics, took some courses at his university, and then abandoned his conservatism and became a liberal shill by the time he graduated. I can't think of a single person I met in college who went through something like that. Every conservative I met in college, he was still a conservative when we graduated, and every liberal I met, he was still liberal when we graduated. Anecdotal, sure, but I sure as hell never saw any of this.

But there is indeed an undeniable disdain for education amongst conservatives. At the very least, the push to excel academically is largely absent in conservative spheres. There's a lot more emphasis on real world stuff, on ""practical"" skills. There's little encouragement to be a straight-A student; the thought process otherwise seems to be that if a teacher is giving a poor grade to a student, it's because that teacher is some biased liberal shill or whatever the fuck. I just don't see conservative culture promoting academic excellence, at least not nearly on the level that you might see in liberal culture. Thus, as a result, conservatives just do not perform as well academically and have far less interest in post-secondary education, which means that more liberals enroll at colleges, which then gives people the false impression that colleges are FORGING students into liberals with their left-wing communist indoctrination or whatever the hell it is they are accused of. People are being misled just by looking at the political alignment of students in a vacuum and not considering the real circumstances that led to that distribution of political beliefs. I think it starts with conservative culture.

1kgt7ag,"CMV: Western societies need to tolerate Islam less, not more.","This is specifically about Islam. I’m generally at odds with organized religion as a whole but among them, Islam stands out as the most ideologically aggressive, violent, and resistant to criticism. Christian or Jewish extremism exists, yes ,but there are levels to this. The scale, frequency, and institutional nature of violence or repression justified through Islamic teachings far surpass what we see from other faiths today.

And yet in Western societies, Islam is treated with extreme caution. Any open criticism is met with accusations of bigotry, and in some cases, violent threats and action. This creates a chilling effect where people self-censor not because they’re wrong, but because they’re afraid. That’s not tolerance, it’s submission.

I believe we should take concrete steps to reduce Islam’s ideological presence in the West:

**Restrict immigration** from Muslim-majority countries where this ideology is deeply embedded.

**Ban mosques** not because every single one is a threat, but because Islam doesn’t just use mosques for prayer. They often function as ideological centers where teachings can cross the line into political and social indoctrination. The potential for radicalization is built into the model. We don’t need structures that act as ideological distribution points for a system fundamentally at odds with our values.

**Protect speech critical of Islam** just as fiercely as we protect any other form of dissent. The current climate of fear is unacceptable in any society that values open discourse.

This is not about persecuting individuals. It’s about treating Islam the way we would treat any ideology that undermines liberal democratic values. We don’t tolerate Nazism. We don’t tolerate theocracy. So why does Islam, in its political and doctrinal form, get special treatment?

1l028yz,CMV: the origin of “Israel has no culture” discourse is Nazi propaganda penetrating the Muslim world.,"A big talking point of the pro Palestine crowd is that ""Israel has no culture it stole all of it culture from others.""
This is a very common idea in the Muslim world today.

My claim is that this is not part of Muslim tradition, and is an import from 20th century Nazi propaganda.

Why I’m convinced:
	•	Pre-modern Muslim writers bash Jews plenty, but never for “having no culture.” The insult shows up only after European antisemitic tracts (like Protocols) hit Arabic presses in the 1920s.
	•	Hitler’s Arabic radio + leaflets (Mufti of Jerusalem on the mic) hammered the “cultural parasite” line all through the war.
	•	Sayyid Qutb, Baʿth textbooks, and 1970s state media basically copy-pasted that language—and that’s what today’s memes echo.

And if the mother wants to abort it, then it hasn't formed any meaningful social connections either. If I were to ask you what day you would consider to be the first day of your life, you'd say the day you were born, not the day you were conceived. If you're not even living a human life yet then you're not really a human being yet.

""Wait, but you just called it a human fetus back there! You're admitting it's a human being and therefore  it has the right to life!"" No, a human fetus isn't a human in the same way that human hair or a human hand isn't a human. Just because something is made of human cells doesn't make it a human being.

""A fetus is a baby, and you wouldn't kill a baby."" Calling a fetus a baby just goes against common sense.  No one in their right mind would place smashing a petri dish with a human IVF embryo in it and killing a baby on the same moral tier. It just goes against intuition. If you google image search ""baby,"" you would never find a picture of a fetus no matter how long you scrolled for.

""My religion says life begins at conception."" And I believe that it doesn't. We're both allowed to have our own beliefs, but beliefs don't form rational arguments. Logic and reason do.

""Abortion scars women for life."" Not getting an abortion when you don't want to give birth is even more scarring. No one gets an abortion because they like doing it, it's just the lesser of two evils.

""Some women die during abortions."" The WHO says ""Deaths from safe abortion are negligible, <1/100 000 *(5).* On the other hand, in regions where unsafe abortions are common, the death rates are high, at > 200/100 000 abortions."" I imagine unsafe abortions occur in places where abortion is illegal, but that's just my supposition. Either way, death by abortion doesn't seem like a huge issue.

I could list other counter-arguments I can refute, but I'll stop there. At the end of the day, women (and everyone for that matter) should be able to control the inner workings of their bodies as much as they can. That much seems like a common-sense human right to me. And lastly, what kind of a life could you expect to have if your own mother didn't want to have you? Abortions ensure that only babies that would be cared for and that are wanted would come into being. So being pro-choice isn't just being pro-choice, it's also being pro-love.

1klmg7r,CMV: President Trump should not accept the 400 million dollar jet from Qatar.,"Donald Trump should not accept the $400 million Boeing 747-8 jet gifted to him by the Qatari royal family. This decision is not merely controversial—it is unethical, unconstitutional, and a blatant affront to the very ideals of American sovereignty and integrity. 

Qatar has long been implicated in funding terrorism, with Trump himself acknowledging in 2017, “The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.” It has provided millions in direct aid to Hamas, hosted its leaders in Doha, and turned a blind eye to known terrorist financiers operating within its borders. Reports have linked Qatari charities to funding al-Qaeda, and wealthy donors from the country have bankrolled Taliban operations. Despite passing counterterrorism laws, Qatar continues to shelter extremists, making Trump’s acceptance of its gift not just unethical, but a serious security risk.

This jet is not a gesture of goodwill—it’s a bribe. Qatar is known for using its wealth to influence leaders who might serve its agenda. The idea that this plane is simply a donation to the United States is absurd. It will eventually be handed over to Trump’s presidential library, meaning it will become a personal asset. No matter how the administration tries to spin it, Qatar is giving Trump something of immense value, knowing it could influence his decisions in the future. 

Beyond ethics, this arrangement directly violates the U.S. Constitution. The Emoluments Clause explicitly forbids government officials from accepting gifts from foreign states. The distinction between gifting the aircraft to the Defense Department first and later passing it to Trump does not change the fundamental issue. Richard Briffault, a government ethics specialist, has noted that once the aircraft is transferred to Trump’s presidential library, it ceases to be a gift to the United States and becomes personal property. No matter how the administration attempts to justify this exchange, it remains a clear-cut example of unconstitutional foreign influence.

This move also contradicts everything Trump has claimed about putting “America First.” He has spent years criticizing foreign governments for exerting influence in U.S. politics. He once attacked Hillary Clinton for accepting money from Qatar (a one million dollar donation to the Clinton Foundation to celebrate Bill Clintons 65th birthday), yet now, he is gladly taking a gift worth $400 million from the same government. His company has also just announced plans for a luxury golf resort in the country. So is this decision based on America’s best interests or his own business ventures?

If Trump proceeds with accepting Qatar’s gift, he does so at the cost of American integrity, transparency, and security. There is no justification for this decision, and no legal loophole can disguise the corruption it represents.",HunterLazy3635,1425,863,0.8600000143051147,0.3179224991226849,1747144245,/r/changemyview/comments/1klmg7r/cmv_president_trump_should_not_accept_the_400/,2025,5,changemyview,2025-05-13 13:50:45
1kt66a7,CMV: we on the progressive left should be adding the “some” when talking about demographics like men or white people if we don’t want to be hypocritical.,"I think all of us who spend time in social bubbles that mix political views have seen some variants on the following:

“Men do X”

Man who doesn’t do X: “Not all men. Just some men.”

“Obviously but I shouldn’t have to say that. I’m not talking about you.”

Sometimes better, sometimes worse.

We spend a significant amount of discussion on using more inclusive language to avoid needlessly hurting people’s feelings or making them uncomfortable but then many of us don’t bother to when they’re men or white or other non-minority demographics. They’re still individuals and we claim to care about the feelings of individuals and making the tiny effort to adjust our language to make people feel more comfortable… but many of us fail to do that for people belonging to certain demographics and, in doing so, treat people less kindly because of their demographic rather than as individuals, which I think and hope we can agree isn’t right.

There are the implicit claims here that most of us on the progressive left do believe or at least claim to believe that there is value in choosing our words to not needlessly hurt people’s feelings and that it’s wrong to treat someone less kindly for being born into any given demographic.

I want my view changed because it bothers me when I see people do this and seems so hypocritical and I’d like to think more highly of the people I see as my political community who do this. I am very firmly on the leftist progressive side of things and I’d like to be wrong about this or, if I’m not, for my community to do better with it.

What won’t change my view: 

1) anything that involves, explicitly or implicitly, defining individuals by their demographic rather than as unique individuals. 

2) any argument over exactly what word should be used. My point isn’t about the word choice. I used “many” in my post instead and generally think there are various appropriate words depending on the circumstances. I do think that’s a discussion worth having but it’s not the point of my view here.

3) any argument that doesn’t address my claim of hypocrisy. If you have a pragmatic reason not to do it, I’m interested to hear it, but it doesn’t affect whether it’s hypocritical or not.

What will change my view: I honestly can’t think of an argument that would do it and that’s why I’m asking you for help.

1keqtit,CMV: it’s perfectly reasonable to drop friends over political views,"I’ll start by clarifying that I’m a leftist, and that will inform a lot of the examples I use, but I don’t think you need to be a leftist to agree with me here. 
Lots of people, admittedly less these days, talk about how silly it is to stop being friends with someone or dislike someone over their political views. I don’t agree. People who say this act as if politics are some given trait or private matter like religion or culture, when it’s inherently not. Especially in a democratic country, a person’s political views have an impact on the society they are a part of. Yes, people inherit their beliefs from their family or whatever sometimes, but ultimately political views are rarely arbitrary, people tend to have reasoning to support theirs. I want to exclude from this people who clearly haven’t critically engaged with their views or politics. If you grew up in a republican household for example, and you study engineering and kind of just follow headlines, you aren’t really responsible for those views. Also, I mean this more for close friends. If you run in the same circles as someone you disagree with, there’s no reason to make an issue of it if they’re not someone you’re close with, trust, or love, ect.  
I’m not just talking about hateful or extreme views though, like thinking that gay people are sinful or supporting the deportation of green card holders for expressing their beliefs. Even basic beliefs about tax structure, regulations, or welfare. Just because those aren’t as flashy/provocative, doesn’t make them unimportant (they are often more impactful and broad in reach even). Like I said, I’m generally a leftist. If you are a “moderate” or believe in fiscal/macroeconomic policy that maintains the status quo, I think I should be totally justified in having a problem with that. 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and you believe that’s okay? Thats your right, but to me it shows we don’t have the same values (even ethically speaking) and I don’t want to have a close relationship with you. 
Let’s say you’re right libertarian leaning, and you think a too powerful state poses an existential risk, or maybe you think property is a god given right and wealth redistribution violates natural law or something (sorry if this sounds like a straw man for the right, that’s not my point though. If your friend believes in lots of regulation and democratic socialism, I think you have a good reason not to want to be close friends with them. 
Look, I’m not saying you should do this. I have lots of friends I disagree with about this stuff and I’m willing to look past it. I just think politics are a legitimate reason to end or loosen a relationship with someone.

1knmzjy,CMV: Bachelor's degrees today are what high school diplomas were 40 years ago.,"A high school diploma 40 years ago could get you almost any job that didn't require advanced degree (e.g. MD/DO, JD, VMD, and etc.). But if you look at job postings today for jobs that didn't require any higher education such as receptionist, data entry, retail manager, and etc. have some sort of higher education requirement or strong preference. Someone could live comfortably with a high school diploma job in the middle class up until the 80s.

In the 1980s the high school graduation rate hovered in the lower 70 percent range. Fast forward today, it is now upper 80 percent and in some areas its upper 90 percent. Now does that mean student have become more studious, scholarly, or our education system have drastically improved? Most middle schoolers today probably read and write at a grade school level and can't solve basic quadratic equations let alone any algebraic problems.

One could argue the education system since the 80s has made more strive to be equitable and inclusive to everyone and resulted in artificially pumped up graduation rates so that schools could receive more praise, funding, and attention. We awarded more for less.

Bachelor degrees are now seen as the only viable path to middle class but yet most have a negative ROI if you factor in the cost of attendance and the compounding interest from student loans. No one should have to go college to live a middle-class life. If you want to move up into higher socioeconomic tax bracket then that is what college should be for.

1kyairx,"CMV: The Islamic Golden Age was driven by individual geniuses, not Islamic orthodoxy—and modern glorification of it is dishonest","**Note that this text was translated from Arabic to English by AI and I reviewed it and edited some parts too**  
**---**

I've come to believe that much of the praise Arab Muslims today give to the so-called ""Islamic Golden Age"" is misguided. It treats a handful of brilliant thinkers—like Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Al-Razi (Rhazes), Al-Khwarizmi, and Ibn Rushd (Averröes)—as if they were the natural products of Islamic orthodoxy or Arab culture, when in fact many of these scholars were marginalized, persecuted, or even declared heretics in their time by the very religious and political institutions Muslims now revere.

  
My view is based on several key points:

* **Many of these scholars were persecuted**, not celebrated, in their time. Al-Razi criticized religion and was reportedly blinded by mobs incited by clerics. Ibn Rushd’s books were burned, and he was exiled. Ibn Sina was condemned by Al-Ghazali and accused of heresy.
* **Most were not Arabs**, and many weren't even working within Arab-dominated systems. Persian, Central Asian, and Turkish scholars made some of the biggest contributions, often in relatively tolerant courts like the Buyids or early Fatimids—not under the more orthodox Sunni caliphates. Labeling their work “Arab” or purely “Islamic” science erases the diverse and often non-Arab environments that enabled their ideas.
* **Orthodox Islam turned against philosophy and rationalism.** Thinkers like Al-Ghazali (Algazelus) or Ibn Taymiyya  argued that reason must submit to revelation, which helped shut down the momentum of intellectual inquiry. Theologians who attacked science and philosophy are ironically treated as heroes today, while the thinkers they suppressed are also glorified—this contradiction makes no sense to me.
* **Modern Arab-Muslim societies don’t carry on this legacy.** If Islamic civilization truly had a systemic, religiously-driven scientific culture, why didn’t that legacy continue? Why are major scientific contributions today mostly coming from secular or Western systems? It seems to me that the original scholars were outliers who thrived *in spite of*, not because of, dominant religious culture.

In short, the actual drivers of scientific progress during the Islamic Golden Age were not mainstream Islamic institutions but rather individual genius, cultural cross-pollination (Greek, Indian, Persian), and relatively liberal courts. The glorification of this period by modern Muslims often ignores the uncomfortable truth that mainstream orthodoxy largely opposed or suppressed this intellectual flowering.

  
One more thing I'd like to add that wasn't in my original Arabic text:  
It is also worth noting that many of these scholars, received support not from orthodox Sunni sects, but from non-orthodox Muslim groups like the Shi'i Buyids or even early Fatimids \[whom I myself don't support\], these dynasties most of the time provided MORE intellectually tolerant environments and societies that actually valued rationality and science. Again, while I may not personally align with their theology, it's clear as the sun that they actually created conditions in which rationalist inquiry and scientific advancement are accepted and celebrated, unlike the more rigid circles that later dominated Sunni orthodoxy

  
Why I hold this view:  
I believe the Islamic Golden Age is often misrepresented by most modern Arab Muslims. Many of the scientists and philosophers now celebrated were persecuted by religious authorities of their time. Thinkers were exiled or attacked, not embraced. Most weren’t even Arab, and many were supported by non-orthodox Muslim courts, like the Buyids and Fatimids, that tolerated rationalism, while Orthodox Islam later rejected this intellectual legacy. So I think glorifying it today feels dishonest",Thormosphere_,1578,204,0.800000011920929,0.2454995038081585,1748524548,/r/changemyview/comments/1kyairx/cmv_the_islamic_golden_age_was_driven_by/,2025,5,changemyview,2025-05-29 13:15:48
1kfok4r,CMV: The US should not be supporting Israel.,"**I am going to make this case purely off of how Israel has acted towards the West, and NOT their war crimes in the Gaza strip or occupation zones or anything like that.**

This is for 2 reasons:

1. because many Western readers may not be as concerned with the Palestine issue (understandable, as it doesn't directly affect their daily lives as much as the climate crisis or social issues),
2. and because Israel often claims that the ICC and the rest of the world courts are biased against Israel, so we'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they're correct and aren't committing even a single crime against Palestinians.

so I will try to make the case that Israel's violations **towards Western powers alone** should be the reason we cut funding to that country.

* Israel [does not honor US sanctions on Russia](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/netanyahu-governments-approach-russia-and-ukraine) in response to the Ukraine invasion, making it the only US ally to do so. They continue full trade with them against the request of the US, as US-led NATO is actively trying to repel the Russian invasion in Ukraine and negotiate to end the war.
* Not only that, they go even further and demand the US allows [Russia to be able to keep their military bases in Syria](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-lobbies-us-keep-russian-bases-weak-syria-sources-say-2025-02-28/) following the deposition of Omar al-Bashir.
   * (Russia literally [funds Iran and Hamas](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/russias-relationship-hamas-and-putins-global-calculations) btw)
   * And they do it by lobbying US politicians so we have no choice but to comply with their demands.

After all the funding they’ve received from American taxpayers, they have used it to

* [steal nuclear ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_affair)materials and secrets from the US,
* possess nuclear weapons
   * but gets upset if[ other countries try to](https://x.com/AIPAC/status/1919467904359157963?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet).
* in 2002, [Israel advocated for invasion of Iraq using 300 thousand US soldiers](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/04/opinion/taking-apart-iraq-s-nuclear-threat.html) (US invaded Iraq in 2003)
   * also generally participated in the Saddam Hussein WMD misinformation campaign against US citizens
* and straight up [attacked the USS Liberty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident),
   * we invaded [Mexico because they accidentally arrested a group of US sailors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampico_Affair) and released them an hour later with an apology, then they refused to perform a 21-gun salute to the American flag at the request of a US admiral.
   * we invaded Grenada because they were [building an airport](https://www.projectcensored.org/12-the-grenada-invasion-a-classic-case-of-censorship/) that looked like it could be used to attack the US. Every other Caribbean country at this time already had an airport, as they rely heavily on their tourist industries.

Israel is the largest recipient of [US aid of any country (post WW2)](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-military-aid-does-the-us-give-to-israel/), even compared to Ukraine ([USD 180 billion](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)).

If someone comes to your door right now, and says: ""Hi, we would like you to sign our petition. Right now you can send USD 4 billion of aid to Israel, it'll just go on the deficit and US taxpayers will have their taxes increased to cover the cost."" What do you think the percentage of Americans would be who vote ""yes"" on that petition?

Well, it doesn't matter! Just last week, [Trump did just this](https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/trump-sidesteps-congress-giving-billions-to-israel/), and even better, he just did it! [No congress or anything](https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/trump-sidesteps-congress-giving-billions-to-israel/)!

So this is assuming that Israel is completely correct in saying the rest of the world is simply wrong for condemning their actions in the Gaza strip and the West Bank ([they call it ""Judean Sumeria""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89GVWT-Dbys&t=1695s)\*yes, seriously. skip to 33:30 in video\* because that's what it used to be called in 1200 BC, 3000 years ago, when Jews lived there, so they believe this land belongs to them from birth, their so called ""birth-right"" to the land).

1kyh02q,CMV: Liberal social causes often hurt themselves by being too extreme or rigid.,"I agree with most liberal values — equality, inclusion, justice, all that. I’m not against any of it. But sometimes it feels like the *way* these causes are pushed ends up turning people off, even people who are mostly on board.

Things like:

* The language expectations change constantly, and if someone messes up or says something outdated, it feels like they get jumped on instead of just being corrected.
* There’s this “all or nothing” vibe, where if you disagree with one part, suddenly you’re not an ally anymore.
* And the public shaming stuff — even when people are clearly trying to grow or figure things out — just doesn’t feel productive. It starts to feel more about calling people out than actually changing minds.

To be clear, I’m not saying people should get a pass for being racist, sexist, or anything like that. I just think some of the tactics used end up pushing away people who might otherwise support the cause.

1kh5kf9,CMV: Not understanding how stuff works is fine. Not trusting the experts is the problem.,"I often read and hear people berating the ""average voter"" for being too stupid to understand the economy, or the science, and thus voting for the most evil morons possible, i.e. Republicans. The thing is, the average democrat voter doesn't really understand stuff either. 

Sure liberal voters are on average more educated than conservatives, but to truly understand policy, healthcare, and geopolitics, you need a college degree on that topic or, really delve in the research with an exceptionally critical mind for years.

1knazvt,"CMV: People who act like the US is a uniquely cruel, crime ridden and stupid place are participating in the same American essentialism as the people who act like the US is the center of the universe and that freedom and prosperity only exist there.","Since Trump was reelected, I’ve been seeing an increase in anti American sentiments both online and in person. While I understand why (it’s pretty tough to have a good reputation globally when Trump is your president), it’s starting to feel to me like just another flavor of American arrogance. The idea that America is the ultimate hero and that they are the ultimate villain comes from the same place. Blaming every global conflict, every global economic downturn, and every unfavorable cultural movement on the US is just reinforcing the idea that America is the center of the world, and that other countries don’t have their own agency and culture. 

I’ve seen people blame both the Israel/Palestine and Russia/Ukraine wars on the US (they’ve obviously played a part in these wars, but let’s not act like those countries don’t have their own agency and make their own decisions). I’ve seen people blame anti-blackness on the US (as if the US invented racism, and it doesn’t exist in every country on earth). I’ve seen people act like colonialism was an American invention, or that the concept of “stolen land” only applies to the US. I’ve seen people blame the rise of misogyny and antisemitism on the US. To me, this all comes from the same place as the people who say things like “America invented freedom”. 

My main point is that if you’re going to be somebody who gets frustrated when Americans act like they are earth’s saviors, you can’t then turn around and act like America is the driving force of all evil on earth. That is the same thing, just in reverse. The US is just another country, with people who are kind, cruel, smart, stupid, and everything in between, just like everywhere else on earth.

In the future, MANY Palestinians, especially children, will die. This is an intentional wiping out of a population. If Israel can conduct precise strikes in Lebanon, why not Gaza? Why insist on destroying all of Gaza? All of its universities, hospitals, and most of the residential neighborhoods. 

Israel will most likely become an even great pariah. Honestly, it will be well-deserved. On the contrary, why would they want that if they want to normalize?

As for ""protecting itself against terrorism,"" a lot of Gazans will be radicalized by these measures. This move will make Israeli civilians less safe. Honestly, I do not see the logic.

He can use heavy handed enforcement tactics to force violent encounters; shootings, assaults, riots, etc. At that point he declares martial law, claiming he's just trying to keep the peace.  Then he can suspend due process and start rounding up protesters and throwing them in camps (a 1,400 acre detention center is currently being planned for Texas). He can also arrest any politicians who oppose him.

1kym85b,CMV:  Free speech should not be seen as a partisan issue,"I recently came across [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/27/the-anti-woke-warriors-used-to-defend-free-speech-now-they-make-mccarthyism-look-progressive) about the children's entertainer Miss Rachel.  For those of you who don't know who Miss Rachel is, she's a YouTuber who sings saccharine sweet songs.  I personally don't care much for her but my little girls can't get enough of it.  But if you don't feel like reading the article, I can sum it up for you:

Miss Rachel showcased some Palestinian children who have been mutilated in the Gazan war and called for a cease fire.  In response some conservatives are trying to label her as an antisemite and to get her cancelled.  The author of the article I linked to (who I assume if progressive) is calling out said right-wing media figures for their hypocrisy - and rightly so in my opinion - as these were the same people who once championed themselves as defenders of free speech in the face of ""woke tyranny"" and cancel culture.

Now, while I do agree with the entire premise of the article, I feel it would be remiss to not acknowledge that there absolutely have been progressive-minded Americans who have sought to silence points of view that they disagree with from spaces that they control.  Deplatforming comedians who make certain kinds of jokes, disinviting campus speakers who express right of center opinions, or calling for journalists to lose their jobs for writing pieces critical of left wing orthodoxy was - and still is - very much a thing.

This got me to thinking, why are even playing this game of gotcha?  Why are we pointing fingers and saying, ""Look! Look! This side says that they support free speech but really they don't!""

It really isn't that hard to be in favor of free speech and to be consistent in your support for unadulterated expression, regardless of your political views. All you really have to do is say this to yourself:

***""I accept that other people may have opinions that I find upsetting and that make me uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean I should try to keep them from speaking to an audience that wants to hear them"".***

And before we go any further, I want to make it very clear that I am ***not*** talking about the First Amendment.  I am talking about a belief if the right to speak one's mind that transcends legality.  I absolutely understand that a social media platform like Reddit or an NFL team like the San Francisco 49ers or a streaming service like Netflix has every **right** to remove whoever they want for any reason - just was we citizens have the **right** to call for people to be deplatformed or fired...but that does not mean that we **should**.  Sort of like you have the **right** to cheat on your spouse, you have the **right** to ridicule your children but you **should** not do those things, right?  They are morally wrong.

There are exceptions of course.  The main ones that I can think of are as follows:

1. **Calling for actual immediate physical harm** \- So standing in front of an angry mob and calling for them to burn down your neighbor's house.  This cannot be tolerated in any circumstance.
2. **Telling lies that will lead to physical or material damage** \- Classic case is shouting ""fire!"" in a crowded theater, of course, but it could also be telling an old lady that you have kidnapped her son and that she needs to empty her bank account to save him.  There is no place for speech of that sort.
3. **Harassment** \- People have a right to live their lives in peace without being insulted and defamed.  Therefore, putting a sign on your neighbor's lawn stating that he is a child molester or calling someone slurs is not acceptable in my opinion.  People who behave this way on social media sites should be banned accordingly.  No problem there. 
4. **Preventing a discussion from happening** \- Let's say you are at poetry reading and a person stands up and starts banging pots and pans so that no one can hear what the poet says.  The bookshop would be morally in the right to remove such a person.  Similarly, if you go on a subreddit devoted to a certain topic, let's say r/modeltrains, and all you do is disparage their hobby, you should be banned.  You are not keeping in the spirit of their group.  But if you have a sub devoted to r/politics or r/worldnews...I think you ought to really allow a very wide range of opinions, even the ones that are not popular with most of the user base.

And this is really where I think the problem comes in, people from all kinds of political stripes have come to see viewpoints they disagree with as actual harm or damage or harassment - **when they are not.**  They are simply upsetting.

Bringing this back to poor Miss Rachel, the example in the article is a classic case.  There is a war in the Levant and supporters of Israel see any kind of sympathy for Palestinians - even if its for amputee children - as an existential threat.  Just as supporters of Palestine see sympathy for Israel - even if its for rape victims, - as intolerable.  But in each case the partisans are wrong.  It's OK to express support or admiration for either side and people who don't like it ought to be ready to tolerate it, particularly if they are not actually participating in the conflict.  It's not an easy issue.  A war is a very disturbing event.  

And the same goes for abortion, and gun violence, and police shootings, and the history of slavery and the memory of the Civil War and ***any*** kind of joke and on and on.

We live in a world with a lot of different points of view.  Sometimes we are going to be upset and while that might hurt a bit, we ought not to try to make people shut up.

1kh09qd,"CMV: The global outrage over some civilian deaths while ignoring others reveals selective morality, not true empathy.","I believe the world shows selective outrage when it comes to civilian casualties in conflict zones. When children die in Gaza or Ukraine, there's a global outpouring of sympathy, hashtags, media coverage, and activism. But when Indian civilians or soldiers are killed in terrorist attacks like Pulwama, Uri, or 26/11 the same energy is almost never seen.

It feels like empathy is being filtered through political trends. If you're aligned with what's seen as the ""popular"" or ""correct"" cause, your grief is validated. But if you're from a country like India and your attackers are tied to state-sponsored terrorism from Pakistan, suddenly it's seen as ""complicated,"" and global sympathy becomes muted or absent.

I'm not saying we shouldn’t care about innocents in other countries we absolutely should. But I question why grief and outrage seem so inconsistent. If terrorism is wrong, it should be wrong no matter who the victims are. And if dead children are a tragedy, then that truth should be universal not selective.

1kfaxhw,CMV: Arab countries are pretty terrible at protecting their religious and ethnic minorities.,"Whether they are a religious or ethnic minority group, minorities are persecuted and treated as worse than second class citizens. 

The biggest example of the Jews, they were always treated badly in Arab countries, even before Israel existed like Farhud massacre in Iraq (1941) and Hebron massacre (1834), in fact half of Israel population is Mizrahi Jews (MENA Jews) who fled their countries because of Arabs persecuting. There barely any jews left in Arab world while other Muslims nations like Turkey (15k Jews) and Iran (10k Jews) still have thousands of Jews living there. 


Same thing with Christians, Israel is the only MENA country with growning Christian population, attacks against Christians are big problem in Arabic world, there always a news about Christian being killed there and church being bombed. Even under secular Arab regimes like Saddam and Assad, Assyrian names were banned and speaking in Aramaic was discouraged. Coptic language (the native langauge of Egypt) has no native speakers and only used in praying. Amazigh langauges (indigenous langauges of North Africa) are all endangered and some of them got extinct, Libya even banned speaking them under Gaddafi. 


Kurds despite being Muslims are also heavily discriminated in Syria and Iraq, they have been massacre against Kurds (also Assyrians) by Arabs from over century like the Anfal genocide in iraq where 200k Kurdish civlians have been killed. Kurdish langauge and culture (like Newroz holiday) have been oppressed in Iraq and Syria since 60s and there are over 300k Kurds in Syria whom are still stateless to this day.


Since the fall of Assad, Alawites have victim of genocides where many alawite dozens were fullly ethnic cleansed leaving no alawites left and over 31k alawites took refuge in Lebanon and the number is still gorwimg every day. Druze also are persecuted there have been dozens of attacks against them since Assad fall of and they have even called for autonomous region in Syria and support from Israel because they don't trust Sunni Arabs to protect them, same thing in Israel, Israeli duze are very pro-Israel because Palestinians used to persecute them before Israel existed. 


And lasty, there's way more Iraqi mandeans in US, Sweden and Australia than Iraq, it shows how Arab countries failing at protecting  their minorities.

1kcxb89,CMV: It takes more faith in Paul to believe in modern Christianity than in Jesus,"When I read the Gospels, Jesus appears as a Jewish teacher preaching repentance, Torah observance, and the coming Kingdom of God. His message was specific, grounded in Jewish law, and aimed at a Jewish audience. There’s no Trinity, no salvation by faith alone, and no outright dismissal of the Law. But then Paul enters the picture, someone who never met Jesus in life and who redefines the entire framework.

Paul’s writings pivot from Jesus’ teachings to doctrines like grace over law, justification by faith, and a divine Christ figure who replaces obedience with belief. It’s Paul who opens the door to Gentiles and pushes a theology that would be unrecognizable to most first-century Jews. Today’s Christianity, especially in its Protestant forms, leans more on Paul’s interpretation than on Jesus’ own words.

To me, believing in modern Christianity requires trusting Paul’s authority and vision more than Jesus’ teachings. That doesn’t sit right with me.

Keep in mind that I'm not saying that he will arrest Hakeem Jeffries or kill Gavin Newsom or whatever. But I think he will arrest small-scale protesters and activists. 

I think this because Trump is just aggressive to people that he doesn't like or dislikes him. This is proved by the Mahmoud Khalil and Roma Uzurk arrests, just for protesting conservative politicies. 

So, if he doesn't show restraint against them, why would he for others? However, it will be worse because 1) suspending Habeas Corpus will cause more protests and 2) now they won't be able to challenge their arrest.

That being said, Mr Trump is not right. He is ultranationalist-level far right. Not a single one of my policy views align with his except the fact that NATO member states are acting in bad faith and need to face consequences if they do not comply with their commitments. 

While not binding, NATO member states have made formal commitments to spend at least 2% of their annual GDP on national defence. Given escalating tensions globally now (e.g., Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, Russia and Ukraine), it has become more important than ever for NATO allies to stand together in case things cascade into full-scale war. Unfortunately, many NATO member states seem to be free-riding on the NATO defence benefits—especially since a majority of spending is done by the U.S.—by contributing significantly less than 2% of their GDP to defence. Many do not even have a roadmap to reach that benchmark. Agreeing to do something, then failing to follow through while continuing to benefit from the security umbrella provided by others, is an act of bad faith and creates what in politics is known as the free-rider problem. The U.S. spends a disproportionate share of its annual budget on defence, while some ally states contribute little more than token amounts.

If we look purely at estimated death figures, on the high end there are 246,000 deaths from the 2 nuclear bombs (yes I understand many more lives will have been implicated), compared to estimations in the millions on BOTH sides (Allies and Japanese) for a land invasion of Japan. I understand the dangers of a utilitarian perspective, but if we look purely at the numbers they are not even comparable. A quarter of a million compared to multiple millions, when by this point of the conflict an estimated 70-85 million people had already died. I cannot begrudge the Allies for wanting to reduce the overall death toll, and the best way to do that was to end the war as quickly as possible, and in this case that meant using nuclear weapons.

I think in arguments against this, many people also misunderstand the Japanese point of view. Not only were they almost entirely set against surrendering, there was very little structure within the upper echelons of Japanese government/military. We can see this from the Tokyo War Crime Trials, where they all basically refuse to answer questions, claim they didn't have authority over anything, and someone else was in charge. Whilst this does show general chaos of wartime command, it also explains the lack of accountability taken by many of the Japanese following WWII. We can also see how badly some of the Japanese did not want to surrender even after the two bombs were dropped, as there was an attempted coup by some army officers to prevent Hirothi's broadcast accepting defeat. In this speech, the lack of accountability can be seen, as Hirothi claimed there was no intention to ""infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to embark on territorial aggrandisement"" which is just a blatant lie. As recently as 2015, conservative voices in Japan have lobbied Japanese Prime Ministers to reflect that Japans actions were not aggressive or illegitimate. I understand this reflects a minuscule portion of the country, and am by no means saying that Japan is not sorry for the crimes they committed, but it is concerning that this view is still circling around government circles.

There are also the environmental impacts to consider. Mainly the consequences caused by radiation. However, the radiation created from nuclear bomb testing is greater than that created from these two bombs. I understand that those tests were not done on densely populated areas, so the effects of these two will remain greater. I will admit that this is the weakest point of my argument, as there are clear environmental impacts. I just believe the overall lower death toll is of greater significance than the environmental impacts that occurred.

I am willing to change my view on this. Have I underestimated the environmental impact? Do you think even with the lower death toll dropping the nuclear bombs was still morally wrong? If so, why? Again, I am not debating the existence of nuclear bombs, just when they were used to end WWII.

  
EDIT: Thank you everyone for your contributions, I am pleased to say my mind has mostly been changed on this issue. Thank you for mostly a pleasant and intriguing discussion. I posted this as I wanted to have my view challenged, and your contributions have been very helpful. I have tried to respond to and engage with as many of you as possible. I have awarded multiple deltas to people that have brought new things to my attention, or have convinced me that things were more important than I had given them credit for. In no particular order I will list below factors behind my change in view. 

1. 3 days between the two bombs was not long enough 

2. I underestimated the impact of the Soviets, and the effect they had on a potential Japanese surrender, in light of this, the bombs were less necessary 

3. US being unreasonable by demanding unconditional surrender. Whilst I may understand the potential logic behind this, I had not given adequate thought as to how this would've affected Japan's willingness to surrender 

4. Other motivations behind dropping the bombs, aka a dick swinging contest with the Soviets 

5. Bombs or land invasion were not the only two options. There were other options, every options had their drawback but this was not a binary choice as I had originally presented it

6. The bombs could've been dropped on unpopulated areas/military targets 

These are all valid points, and thank you for bringing them to my attention. I will now no longer be responding to comments.

1kzvm77,CMV: I think incels & redpill bros make dating easier for nice guys,"I know it sounds silly, but I think maybe I owe my life to incels & ""red pill"" toxic men

Recently me & my wife celebrated our wedding anniversary. She told me that she couldn't believe she lucked into marrying me, and it's a statement that is on the one hand absolutely absurd - she's beautiful, caring, has a good job, is a wonderful mother & wife, while I am far less attractive, make less money and could probably reasonably be described as ""a weird nerd"". Still, this woman feels like she's the lucky one to be with me. And the funny thing is I completely believe her.

When we exchanged dating stories in the past hers just seem so terrible, while mine are like ""we went on a few dates, didn't work out"". I think this is why I feel my own path to her was just meeting a few women who just weren't for me but were good experiences overall, while she was living a nightmare of the worst guys in the world until she lucked into me - not the worst guy in the world. Jackpot!

And this has been my experience with a lot of the women I went out with - women who seemed genuinely happy to be going out with me  after having a lot of bad experiences.

And this is why I think all those redpill bros & incels might have actually helped me out a lot. They keep trying to ""science"" the subject of dating, a very subjective individual experience, but in doing so may have created a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy. One metaphor I keep seeing in that context is the one of supply & demand. So... A lot of the paradigms they operate under actually act as self sabotage (like making a woman feel beautiful, safe & comfortable are considered bad things in those circles? Like that whole ""girls don't like nice guys l"" thing?). If we bring it back to that market metaphor - I might have really benefited from the disparity between supply and demand by being not a huge asshole in a market absolutely flooded with huge assholes. 

And it seems to hold true - being a reasonably nice dude seems to make me really appealing to women even now. I get looks. I get flirted with. I get complimented a lot for being a good husband & good dad. I feel like hot shit, and objectively I'm probably not. I married way up. It's absolutely silly that the woman I lucked into marrying thinks she married into me, and I think the way a lot of men (not all men, obviously) behave might have significantly contributed to that. I think all those guys might have accidentally stumbled into being right. Women don't want to date them. But it's likely because they are bitter & hate them, which causes them to become even more bitter & hateful, onboarding new guys into being bitter & hateful, and that makes dating much easier for those who have absolutely any amount of chill.

I have never felt more like women really go for nice guys (actually nice guys, not assholes pretending to be nice), and the more people insist it's not true, the easier time actual nice guys are likely to have with women as long as they manage to avoid growing bitter & resentful ",Orgalop,533,326,0.7599999904632568,0.1193689074852627,1748693491,/r/changemyview/comments/1kzvm77/cmv_i_think_incels_redpill_bros_make_dating/,2025,5,changemyview,2025-05-31 12:11:31

1l9r3wh,CMV: There is no practical way for Israel to conduct operations against Hamas that Leftist/Progressive movements will find acceptable,"I am defining “Leftist & / or Progressives movements” as the dominating, majority attitudes and narratives of the leftist & progressive movements in western countries in regards to Israel. An argument that “not all leftists think the same” will not win me over.

I do not believe there is a way for the nation of Israel to conduct operations against Hamas that Leftist and/or Progressives movements will find acceptable. I believe this for the following reasons:

https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/880818a.htm 

In the founding charter of Hamas, it states the organizations goals are to eliminate Israel and to eliminate Jews. The founding charter rejects peaceful solutions, and states this goal must be accomplished via any violence necessary.

To accomplish this goal, Hamas has used the following tactics: 

- Suicide Bombings
- Hostage Taking and Kidnappings of Israeli civilians and soldiers
- Indiscriminate Murder when present in Israeli territory 
- Continual Rocket Launches
-  Utilized Palestinian civilians as human shields
- stolen aid intended for Palestinians
- destroy infrastructure meant to provide resources to the Palestinians instead to reuse as weaponry 

These tactics all by themselves are atrocious. However, there is the added caveat that **Hamas is the ruling government of Gaza.** This means that Hamas is using **state resources** that functioning states would use to build infrastructure, feed the population, and develop the nation, Hamas instead divert in order to conduct their war effort against Israel.

When looking at the options that Israel has at its disposal to deal with Hamas, there are **no options available that Leftist/Progressives find acceptable.**

- To prevent suicide bombings and the indiscriminate murder and kidnapping of its citizens, Israel has erected checkpoints and a border wall with the Gaza Strip. But this contributes to leftist and progressive arguments that Gaza is an “open air prison”.

- to prevent Hamas from acquiring advanced weaponry the Iron Dome would be unable to deflect and thus lead to the leveling of cities in Israel, Israel maintains a blockade of Gaza. Again, this has been met with cries from leftist and progressives that Gaza is an open air prison and stopping aid from getting through. 

- to prevent Hamas from continuing to launch rockets from a given location within Gaza territory, Israel exterminate the aggressor by liquidating the site with rocket fire. But because Hamas used human shields, Israel is met with accusations from leftists that Israel is targeting civilians with inevitably a hospital or school that is being used as a site to launch rockets ends up having civilian casualties. 

- to prevent Palestinians civilians from getting hurt in urban warfare, Israel has attempted to evacuate citizens from areas it plans to do these operations. But once again, Israel is met with accusations from leftists and progressives that Israel is trying to “deport/ethnically cleanse” Gaza.

I am making this post because Leftist and Progressives always are criticizing Israel in how it conducts itself against Hamas. These same groups, however, always fail to provide **practical alternatives** to how the state of Israel should conduct operations in away that guarantee its own safety as a nation while being deemed “morally / ethically acceptable.” I am open to hearing these suggestions, but so far no good answers have been provided.

If a blockade, border security, air strikes, evacuation zones, and military invasion are all unacceptable methods for dealing with Hamas and protecting itself **what solutions do Leftists and Progressives find acceptable**?

But when right-wingers protest (COVID lockdowns, school boards, January 6), they seem to expect nuance and understanding. Suddenly context matters.

Take the recent LA protests after mass ICE raids. The majority were peaceful, but a few people looted. Instead of separating protestors from criminals, many conservatives immediately lumped them together and accused “the left” of condoning lawlessness.

If you really care about law and order, why is the outrage so selective? Why do ICE raids that break up families not trigger the same passion as a smashed store window?

1l35ymt,"CMV: As a gay man, I believe the culture and attitudes pervasive in online female spaces judge men by extremely harsh standards they would find unacceptable if applied to themselves","Gunna get this out of the way before I continue: “Why was mentioning you are a gay man important?”

Because if I say I’m just a man, I’m going to assumed to be straight, and my opinion dismissed as when straight men normally express dissatisfaction with how they are treated and perceived in online female spaces.

With that out of the way-

I think women in online spaces dedicated to women view and treat men in ways that if they were treated themselves would be derided as unfair, immoral, cruel, and unacceptable. Men in these spaces, especially if it involved romance or dating, are judged very critically and harshly by many benign and superficial things, such as:

- the way they look

- the interest and hobbies they hold 

- the way they speak or act 

“But, but, you have to judge people by those things to make sure your compatibility.”

100% agree. 

The problem lies in the double standards.

A clear example that comes to mind is that it is totally acceptable in female spaces to judge a man for being under six foot. There’s a derogatory insult that is played off as just teasing- short kings. But if you judge a woman by her weight, it’s deemed as body shaming.

Men who like fishing get judged. But don’t dare insult women on the hobbies they like because that’s misogyny.

If an “unattractive” man shoots his shot with a girl, he’s laughed, called a troll, referred to as “that” and “it”. But if boys were to do the same to an unattractive girl they’d be called chauvinist bullies.

“Where do get the audacity to-“ is a common phrase, but if men generalize women they’re just continue  stereotypes of women.

“I can’t have my man be girly or feminine.” But if you judge a girl for having masculine interests you’re just continuing the patriarchy. 

Like…do straight men and women even want to date each other at this point? You guys sound so miserable 😭

The Settlements and the Settler movement are considered illegal under International Law. There is a well-documented mountain of evidence of Settlers using violence and intimidation (including but not limited to murder, rape and sexual violence, destruction of property, etc) against the Civilians of the West Bank and East Jerusalem with the goal of expelling the Palestinian natives and settling their lands as they believe the land was promised to them. Even the US Department of State has defied Settler Violence as Terrorism.

I define State Sponsored Terrorism as Terrorist violence that is carried out with the active support of national governments provided to violent non-state actors.

The Israeli government has been actively supporting Israeli settlements giving funding and giving subsidies to the settlers, arming the settlers, and even creating government sponsored programs to expand the illegal settlements.

1l38g9o,CMV: Calling all men predators is inherently sexist and puts off most men from wanting to understand your views.,"It is hard to engage in meaningful conversation with people from various popular subreddits when you already are being demonized as a predator under a generalized view of men. I don't want people to think I am saying that all men are perfect or anything. 

In fact far from it, an estimated 91% of victims of rape & sexual assault are female and 9% male. **Nearly 99%** of perpetrators are male. 

Anything even close to this statistic is insane and horrendous but to even pretend that a majority of men are predators is ridiculous and will just push people further away from understanding your position completely. 

Even the men who got SA'd by other men would be considered predators...

Also, you really think calling out all men for being predators is really going to make any kind of systematic change? You think the men that are predators even care that you call ""all men"" predators? 

I think if anything you are likely enabling them to be predators because now there literally is no difference between a non-predator man and a predator man because they are all predators.

Maybe people are more nuanced than I give them credit for and they don't actually think all men are predators and its just something to say in general to cope with the heinous crimes in this world but I think if you actually want to fix that inequality you wouldn't perpetuate gender stereotypes and making people feel bad for doing nothing and would instead try to have meaningful conversation and understanding. Not in a patronizing educational way but more having a clear understanding of what we can do as people to make sure everyone is safe because it seems like predators have tricks they use to try to isolate their victims etc.. and men can be a little bit socially inept so knowing when women need help when its less obvious is key I think.

This is also not exclusively women spaces or something before you think I am going into women's only subreddits and criticizing them for what they want to say to each other. 

TLDR: I don't think saying ""all"" for any group of people is really correct ESPECIALLY when its not even being used as a shorthand to refer to a majority. It just further distances understanding between men and women and leads more men to be burnt out or increasingly apathetic towards these issues and not think its even a problem when it seriously is a problem.

1ljmah1,CMV: The “work is slavery” and anti-work mindset is disconnected from reality,"I’ve seen a growing number of people who claim that humans weren’t meant to work and that we should just enjoy life and reject the 9 to 5. On here, Tiktok, Twitter, it’s like some sort of revolution of lethargic, lazy people. But their perspective ignores something fundamental. Everything they enjoy in life exists because other people do work.

The vacations they post about, the restaurants they eat at, the games they play, the clean water they drink, all of it is made possible by people who show up to jobs every day. Infrastructure, technology, public services, even the internet they use to complain, all depend on a functioning workforce.

It’s not just naïve. It is hypocritical. Especially when some of these same people push for socialist or communist systems where the idea is to redistribute the results of other people’s effort while avoiding responsibility themselves. It is not about fairness. It is about avoiding work and expecting others to pick up the slack.

You do not have to love your job. But pretending that work is inherently evil while relying entirely on the labor of others is not some enlightened view. It is entitled. Also, for those that are saying we shouldn’t work 40 hours a week, you are piled into this. Don’t expect higher wages for less work, it’s asinine thinking.

1lkchul,"CMV: I’m left-leaning, but the way the left treats the middle class is becoming alienating","I’ve always leaned left: supporting unions, progressive taxation, and public investment. But I’ve started to feel alienated by a growing tone of hostility toward the middle class, especially online and in activist spaces.

I don’t own a home. I rent, I work full-time, and I’m managing student debt and rising living costs. Still, I’ve noticed people in my income bracket (~$80K–$200K) increasingly framed as part of the problem. The middle class is now being accused of upholding unjust systems or being too comfortable to care. Just having a stable salary seems to invite blame.

I fully support holding the ultra-wealthy and corporations accountable. But when the frustration extends to people just trying to stay afloat, it feels less like solidarity and more like resentment. I want to believe in a left that builds coalitions across class - not one that turns on people who aren’t struggling “enough.”

1lb86kj,CMV: Israel attacking Iran makes perfect sense.,"Iran built its entire Israel strategy around a network of proxy states and paramilitary groups. They spent tens of billions of dollars arming Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis and supporting Bashar Al Asads regime in Syria. 

The goal of this investment was to encircle Israel and grant Iran the ability to threaten Israel on multiple fronts while protecting Iranian territory. 

This strategy failed big time and faster than anyone could imagine. 

In less than two years, Israel has nearly annihilated Hamas, decapitated Hezbollah, precipitated the fall of Asad’s Syria, and is perfectly capable of handling the Houthis who turned to be more of a nuisance than a threat. 

Iran is now alone, reasonably broke, and at its weakest. 

Israel is winning on all fronts and has retained the military support of all its allies. Add to this the potential alignment of the entire Levantine region with Saudi Arabia. 

It makes absolute sense to strongly and aggressively attack Iran right now. This is the closest to the regime falling Iran has probably ever been, and the weakest militarily. Israel would blunder big time if they didn't seize this opportunity.

1ldyb9e,"CMV: Hasan Piker isn’t a good representative of the left-wing because of his uncritical amplification of extremist talking points, selective bias, and toxic on-air behavior","Hey everyone,

I’ve been not followed Hasan for a long time. I have recently started watching his videos. I agree with him on mostly all US politics. I respect this role as a critical and popular voice against trump. But recently there has been a search for the face of left wing media (a Joe Rogan figure) and many people believe Hasan fits this bill. I frankly strongly disagree.Here’s why:

1. Platforming Extremist Narratives

a. He’s hosted a self-described “Houthi pirate” who openly celebrated hijacking a commercial vessel for the Houthis (a U.S.-designated terrorist group) and largely praised that action as resistance.

b. On multiple occasions he’s given airtime to pro-Hamas or pro-Hezbollah talking points—labeling them “resistance”—without clearly calling out the atrocities those groups commit.
Any right wing figure will be rightly called out for such behaviour. 

2. Selective Criticism & Unacknowledged Bias

a. Hasan fiercely defends Muslims against Islamophobia but has never publicly criticized any Islamic organizations (even those linked to radical violence).
b. He’s quick to call out Christian nationalism yet seems unwilling to hold similar standards for an Islamist or extremist-linked institutions—suggesting a religious or identity-based double standard.

For someone to be the face of diverse left wing they need to call out all extremists.
 
3. Journalistic Oversight & “Bad Journalism”
a. In a segment on a recent Kashmir terror attack, he invited a guest who downplayed the murder of Hindu tourists and refused to acknowledge known facts from multiple credible sources —yet Hasan didn’t  challenged
 those claims and just platformed his views.

b. He often frames news as raw “takes” rather than rigorous, sourced analysis, letting guests push one-sided narratives uncorrected.

4. Toxic On-Air Persona
a. I don’t find his style of masculinity healthy. It’s not better if a left wing man is shouting and showing off his alpha masculinity.

5. Is He Unique?
No. Sure, he does left-wing commentary on Twitch and reaches millions, but dozens of other commentators do the same without normalizing extremist violence or dog-whistling to their base.

My Position:
I believe a credible left-wing media figure should platform all sides responsibly, call out extremist ideology—regardless of religion or politics—provide context and fact-checks in real time, and model respectful, non-toxic discourse. Hasan Piker fails on these fronts often enough that I can’t see him as a good representative of progressive values.

CMV: I’m open to the possibility that I’m being too harsh or missing broader context. As I said I just started watching him recently so what I have written is based on the videos I watched , Reddit threads (pro and anti) and factchecking with Chat GPT. I have done my due diligence without watching all his videos as frankly I don’t want to give my time to that. What am I overlooking? Are there examples where Hasan has consistently held all extremists to account, or moments where he’s moderated extremist guests rigorously? How do you reconcile his faults with any unique value he brings?",aloo-ka-paratha,1069,1839,0.6399999856948853,0.3000063152696663,1750192966,/r/changemyview/comments/1ldyb9e/cmv_hasan_piker_isnt_a_good_representative_of_the/,2025,6,changemyview,2025-06-17 20:42:46
1lk296b,"CMV: Americans shouldn’t call themselves Irish, Italian, German, etc., if they are many generations removed and don’t actively live and contribute to that culture.","I’m from Quebec and there, people tend to identify based on the culture they actively live and participate in. Even if someone has Irish, French, British, or German ancestry and maybe still cooks certain traditional meals, celebrate holidays or knows some family stories they typically say “I’m Québécois,” not “I’m Irish” or “I’m French.” The identity is tied to the culture they were raised in and contribute to daily.
That’s why I find it confusing that many Americans call themselves Irish, Italian, German, etc., when their connection to those places is often distant like a great-great-great-grandparent and they’ve never been to the country, don’t speak the language, and don’t participate in the actual modern culture and society of that nation.
I feel like Americans often blur ethnicity with ancestry and heritage. Just because your family came from somewhere generations ago doesn’t necessarily mean you’re ethnically that today especially if you don’t speak the language, follow the customs, or meaningfully participate in the culture and/or current events. To me, there’s a big difference between having Irish ancestry and being Irish. But in the US, those two things often seem treated as the same.
From my outside perspective, it seems like this happens because a lot of Americans feel disconnected from a specific national culture of their own. The US is a very diverse and mixed country, and in many cases, “just being American” feels bland or culturally empty so claiming an ethnic label feels more meaningful, especially when talking to someone from abroad. It may come from a place of wanting to feel special, grounded, or connected to something old or “real.” I get that. But it also comes across as disconnected, surface level, cringey, cultural sampling and sometimes disrespectful to the people from that nation.
But when people like me from outside the US question this, some Americans react really defensively. It feels like they hear, “You’re bland” or “You have no culture,” when really we’re just trying to understand why ancestry is treated like identity even when it’s really far removed from current lived experience.
In Quebec, even when we still carry on family traditions, we don’t usually claim to “be” the ethnicity unless we were actually raised and lived in that cultural setting. To us, cultural identity is about your lived reality, not just fragments of heritage. It’s the language you speak, the region you live in, the worldview you share, and the culture you contribute to every day.
I’m not trying to mock or insult anyone. I understand people have pride in their family roots and traditions, and that’s valid. I just think there’s a difference between having ancestry and claiming identity, and I’d love to hear from Americans who see it differently. Because as someone who is also from a country that is a melting pot of cultures it’s very confusing.

Please keep it civil this isn’t meant to offend or dismiss anyone’s experiences. I’m genuinely open to having my view changed and understanding this better.

The simple fact is that in the two major conflict zones right now, Israel/Iran & Russia/Ukraine, at least  one side doesn't have a mutual defense pact with a strong enough country to trigger a cascade like what happened in WW1.

Iran doesn't have allies that care about it (Russia could have been seen as that, but they've publicly washed their hands of the situation), to the point that their own proxies like Hezbollah aren't getting involved.
Ukraine has the backing of the West, but no country has agreed to commit troops, and while Russia is getting support from North Korea, it's both ineffective and stops there.

1lmm5ee,"CMV: Redditors / Reddit present themselves as open minded, and supportive of diversity but in practice, it heavily censors or discourages conservative viewpoints","I always considered myself as liberal, open minded and progressive. I genuinely value hearing different perspectives and I always loved reading reddit because of that. Now I dont have any social media Reddit is only place I come to see different opinions. But over time, I have felt like Reddit has become extremely one sided, especially when it comes to political or socially charged topics. I notice that conservative or even moderately right leaning views often get treated with immediate hostility not just by users, but by moderators and even automated moderation systems.

It seems like if you post anything remotely sympathetic to views outside the dominant narrative for example, about Trump, abortion, immigration, or even certain local politicians your post either gets buried, mass downvoted, or removed by an automod before it even has a chance. I had a post about Zohran Mamdani as someone who loves NYC and it has taken down instantly, even though it didn’t say anything inflammatory and reason was irrelevant and i am writing about it because it is the most recent And i have seen others go through the same if not worse. 

Even subreddits that are supposed to encourage debate, like CMV, often feel like they only tolerate opposing views rather than truly welcoming them, actually not even tolerated. That doesn't feel like open mindedness to me and it feels like gatekeeping under the guise of civility or rule enforcement.

The part that hits me most is that Reddit seems to treat a huge portion of the country roughly half, depending on how you look at it as not just wrong, but evil. I am not even a Republican, but this has made me question whether I identify as a liberal or Democrat anymore. It’s a strange feeling, because I used to feel totally at home here. Now, I scroll Reddit and feel anxious, sad, or just disconnected. And I hate that because I still love Reddit and want to enjoy it the way I used to.

I am open to being proven wrong. Maybe I’m misreading things, or missing the bigger picture. Maybe moderation works differently than I assume. But right now, it doesn’t feel like Reddit lives up to its image as a place for real, diverse discussion.

Problem is, this is making me take harder stances on things that I dont even care that much. 

I know i ll get a lot of hate, and I know I also get heated and say things out of proportion but I am hoping to see couple of people with reason here so I still have a reason to come back here.

1l9v6g2,"CMV: There is no good reason, with the exception of special needs cases, to homeschool children in the US. Homeschooling is, again with that one exception, always a manifestation of the parent's desire for control, not of the child's best interest. Notes and Caveats in Body","The one notable exception is for a child with special needs, if you live in an area where the local public school system does not have adequate staff/training/facilities to educate your child. In that case, I would agree there is a good reason to homeschool. Otherwise, there are none. 

Common Objections-

1- But my school district sucks!: Unless you are a world class educator, which you probably aren't, even a fairly mediocre or overworked school system will still be able to provide your child a better education through the network of dozens of trained professionals your child will have access to over a given school year, than you can alone. Is the height of hubris to thing that you are equal to or better than a math teacher+ reading teacher+ history teacher+ social studies teacher+ science teacher+ gym coach+ guidance counselor, etc etc etc, even fairly mediocre ones. You are not.

2- But our schools are dangerous!: Then send them to a private school. Not all private schools are for rich people, there are middle class and even working class private schools. The tuition to these school will still cost less than the expense of your own training to properly educate, the materials, and your own time spent being a home educator rather than being out working. I get that maybe you WANT to be a stay at home educator, but again, if the best interest of your child and there education is genuinely your priority, even if your public schools are terrible, you will do better by them if you work a job and spend that wage on private school tuition. You are not a replacement for a school. If you are in a situation where you cannot afford even a low end private school, then you are not in a position to be able to afford to do a better job than your public school would anyway.

3- But my children will be exposed to (insert thing I don't like): Good! Social skills and learning how to navigate mixed company settings and social spaces with difference influences and cultures and ideas is just as important to be a properly adjusted and functioning adult as the book learning. In some contexts even more so.

  
What will change my mind: 

Some scenario, other than the single notable exception I listed above, where I am convinced that being homeschooled will actually result in a better education and better intellectual, emotional, and personal development than enrollment in a public school would, WHILE ALSO being a situation where a low end private school is also out of the question.

1ldftpo,CMV: Americans and people in the West who believe the Russian talking points about the war against Ukraine are some of the stupidest people in the world,"I understand the title comes across as harsh, but this is true as it gets. With Russians living in russia it makes sense why they believe the lies told, but for Americans and people in the west that have access to information free from the russian state, it just stupid.

Let me be crystal clear: I'm not saying that every single person who questions the war in Ukraine is stupid. Nor am I saying that questioning U.S. foreign policy will necessarily turn one into an ignorant individual. But when I hear people in the West—especially Americans—parrot talking points verbatim from the Kremlin propaganda machine, I can't help but question that we're working with some of the most gullible, uninformed, and plain stupidest individuals on this earth.

You don't have to be a geopolitical sage to see what's going on. A nuclear power dictatorship ruled by a man in office longer than the majority of Reddit users have been alive bombs a sovereign democratic neighbor. It takes land, kills civilians, and targets infrastructure—flagrant violations of international law. And still, there are Western apologists for it.

Some of the arguments I continually hear:

""NATO provoked Russia.""
Even if you believe that NATO expansion was a failure, nobody can explain an all-out invasion of a country that did not pose a threat to Russia. Ukraine was far from joining NATO when the invasion began.

""Ukraine is corrupt.""
True, but so is Russia—on a far larger and more systemic scale. Ukraine was (and continues to) work towards reforms and conduct democratic elections. Russia poisons journalists, jails opposition, and occupies neighbors. If corruption deserves an invasion, half the world is up for sale.

""The U.S. does bad things too.""
Yes, America does have a dirty history. That is no reason for Russia to be given a free pass to commit war crimes. This is the most idiotic whataboutism. Two wrongs do not make a right.

""It's all fake news, Ukraine is losing, it's just Western propaganda.""
This is astounding. Westerners with access to free media fall for easily debunked propaganda from state-run Russian sources. They gobble up blatantly staged ""news"" segments, fake maps, and appallingly terrible military analysis. If you believe that RT or some Telegram account with a hammer and sickle avatar avatar is providing you with the ""real story,"" I've got a bridge to sell you.


To believe these talking points is to disregard mountains of evidence, credible reporting, satellite imagery, war crimes reports, and the lived experiences of tens of millions of Ukrainians. And for what? To feel like you're ""not like the sheep,"" that you ""know the truth"" when in fact you've been conned by one of the most well-documented propaganda operations of the last century?

This kind of idiocy is not innocuous either. It undermines democratic solidarity with Ukraine, emboldens authoritarian governments, and mocks the very principle of truth in the public sphere. It's not ""just an opinion"" when it is grounded on falsehoods, and it is openly calling for a war of aggression.

So certain, I'll say it again: if you live in a free country that can access facts and still choose to believe Putin's disinformation, then you're voluntarily ignorant, intellectually lazy, or woefully gullible.

It seems to me that all attempts at peace are fruitless and I haven’t seen any probable solutions proposed. Furthermore, it seems that the US will continue to provide weapons and support to Israel at least for the rest of Trump’s term. 

Please change my mind. I’m specifically looking for a possible (at least somewhat likely) end to the war that does not include the annihilation of Gaza.

1l647lt,CMV: Anti-white racism is not a serious nor prevalent issue in the United States.,"First off, let me start with saying that I'd oppose and stand against any *actual* anti white racism. 

But I just simply don't think it's prevelant in American society throughout the vast majority of the nation.

Do people who hate white people exist? Of course, but not the point to which we have a serious and persistent issue of anti white racism that is pervasive. 

The main argument I have here is the weakness of the other side's arguments. I feel like those who believe anti white racism is pervasive in America don't really have strong examples.

Many will claim either examples which the backing for is unclear or outright false examples. For instance, many will say DEI is anti white racism, but won't actually tell us how. Or, for instance, they'll use the example of the left's objection to the Afrikaner refugees from South Africa. But that would be more easily and directly explainable by pointing to the left not believing they had valid refugee cases and also Trump's spurning of refugees the left *does* believe have valid cases. 

Overall, it's just a generally unsubstantiated point in my view.",Early-Possibility367,42,1835,0.5099999904632568,0.2232489881312846,1749359005,/r/changemyview/comments/1l647lt/cmv_antiwhite_racism_is_not_a_serious_nor/,2025,6,changemyview,2025-06-08 05:03:25
1l0xvyn,"CMV: For better or worse, Greg Abbot’s decision to bus illegal immigrants to “blue cities” was a political masterstroke and may very well have tipped the 2024 Presidential Election to Donald Trump.","For those who don’t know, Greg Abbott is the “beloved” governor of Texas and belongs to the Republican Party. For over a decade now but really in the last 5-6 years the migrant crisis at the border has been really bad for a variety of reasons both outside the United States control and within it but regardless of *why* it happened the unavoidable truth to most Texans was that there was a problem. 

And for years most on the Left dismissed the complaints as racist hyperbole by white folk that didn’t want to share their precious, racially homogenous cities and towns with brown people. When Trump rode to power in 2016, many on the Left proudly declared themselves opposed to his anti-immigration policies and supported the creation of “sanctuary cities”. 

Abbot’s response from to 21-24 was “okay, you want them so bad? Take ‘em” and began bussing hundreds upon hundreds of migrants to cities like Chicago and NYC. The rest is recent history. The migrants arrive and white liberals learn native black and brown Americans don’t like migrants anymore then their Texan fellow citizens, it becomes a toxic symbol of the immigration chaos of the Biden administration and on the Left more broadly.

This feeds into the growing consensus among Americans nationally that immigration is out of control and that we have a crisis at our southern border, which Donald Trump in turn helps use to take back the White House in 24. Greg Abbott turned himself into a darling of the Right by forcing liberals to put their money where the migrants mouth was, got rid of unwanted migrants and quite possibly changed the course of national history all for the low, low price of a bus ticket.

1lffpfd,"CMV: Israel’s attack on Iran was intended to draw the US into war, not prevent Iran from having a nuke","Israel claims its attack on Iran on Friday was about preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. I think that this is a pretty transparent lie for the reasons below.

Israel has been claiming Iran has been close to a nuclear weapon for 30 years. North Korea is significantly less advanced than Iran, but has successfully developed a nuke during that time period. 

Iran previously had a nuclear weapon program. That ended in 2003 to avoid getting attacked by the US. Since then, it looks like it’s strategy has been to use its nuclear capability for deterrence. (“stop fucking with us; we can build a nuke pretty quickly”)

It is clear that Iran does not want a conflict with the United States. Openly weaponizing their nuclear program invites that conflict. 

Of course, they could pursue weaponization in secret. But the US, UK and Israel knowingly misrepresented evidence of WMD prior to the Iraq war. It is more than fair for the public to demand proof of weaponization since one party in this conflict has previously used this exact same lie as cover for regime change.

Israel does not have the ability to inflict significant damage to Iran’s nuclear program or pursue regime change in Iran on its own. Even if they had the capability to destroy Fordow, the enriched uranium is almost certainly spread out across the country. If Iran’s entire nuclear program including the uranium were destroyed, it could still develop a bomb in under 5 years.

The only ways to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuke is convincing the regime that a nuke is not in their best interest or changing the regime. 

It’s still early, but it seems like Israel’s attack has made the idea of having a nuke more appealing to Iranians and the regime. It looks like having a nuke is the only way to deter Israel and its allies.

So why would Israel attack Iran? I think the most straightforward answer is they were hoping Iran would retaliate in a manner that forced the US to enter the conflict and pursue regime change.

Iran hasn’t taken the bait, so now Israel is attempting to present Iran as neutered by their campaign. “Iran is weak. Come over and help us finish the job”

Iran has been weakened, but they clearly have the capability to inflict more damage on Israel than they have demonstrated. The threat of offensive US involvement has constrained their response.

Once the US attacks, Iran will no longer be constrained by the threat of the US joining the conflict and will retaliate on US/ Israeli assets. The US will officially be in an offensive war that it did not initiate. This was Netanyahu’s actual calculation before Friday.

My view can be changed by concrete evidence of Iran’s nuclear weaponization and/or an explanation of how Israel thinks this bombing campaign will prevent Iran from pursuing a nuke without US involvement.

TL;DR: Israel doesn’t have the capability to meaningfully impact Iran’s nuclear program or pursue regime change on its own. They attacked Iran hoping that they could provoke a strong response that would draw the US into the conflict.

When Iserial or now US forces attack Iran these are referred to as ""strikes."" When Iran strikes back it is described as a ""barrage and an attack.""

When the United States bombs a sovereign country the leading quote included is ""America does not seek war,"" which is insane as America just committed an act of war.

Meanwhile the Israelis continue to bomb major metropolitan areas in Iran. Yet these attacks are described as ""hitting targets"" with no mention of the civilian causulities involved. Yet when Isreali metropolitan areas are are hit we get detailed civilian casualty reports, and almost no mention of what the ""target"" was.

After the recent US attack, it is being reported that a diplomatic solution is still what US high command wants and that a ""larger protracted conflict is unlikely."" This is clearly a lie, and for it to be reported with out any context pushback or counterpoints is pure propaganda.

This is the exact same playbook as WMD in Iraq. The sanitization of the true nature of state violence by the media to serve the whims of the regime is disgusting.

Parents can not be relied on to provide accurate and comprehensive sexual education to their kids, therefore the school system must step in to do so.

However currently parents are provided an option to opt their kids out of sex-ed, and prevent them from receiving it entirely. This option is somewhat unique to sex-ed, as parents aren't typically able to opt their kids out of specific parts of a school curriculum because of personal preference (I can't just choose to exclude my kid from learning about fractions).

1lke2i1,CMV: Diaspora Jews are unfairly treated and wrongly seen as a threat to the countries they live in,"I was born and raised in a Muslim-majority country as part of a small Jewish family. Over the years, I have witnessed how diaspora Jews are often subjected to unfair treatment, especially during times of international conflict. They are frequently viewed with suspicion, as if they secretly serve a foreign agenda or pose a threat to the countries they live in.

I believe this perception is deeply flawed, historically inaccurate, and socially harmful. Most diaspora Jews are peaceful, loyal citizens who simply want to live normal lives like everyone else. Yet, the moment a geopolitical crisis emerges, their loyalty is questioned, and they become targets of hate, conspiracy theories, and exclusion.

This is not just about political disagreements, it is about collective prejudice that gets triggered again and again regardless of context.

I’m open to hearing why some people might see this differently. If there are genuine reasons to be concerned about diaspora Jewish identity, I would like to understand them. But from my perspective, this generalized suspicion has no rational basis.

Below is a longer article I wrote with personal reflections and broader context.

1lo9q2s,CMV: Most people who claim to be pro-life are just pro-birth.,"Most people who claim to be pro-life actually only care about the fetus not being aborted. They do not care (as much or perhaps at all) about the baby and the family after it is born. 


Many people who are pro-life actively support politicians and policies that harm low-income working-class families or even just have opinions contradicting their “pro-life” stance. 


Cutting funds/ shutting down programs such as Medicaid, WIC, SNAP, early childhood education, etc., actively harms families and children. 
There are tons of people who look down on single mothers or parents trying to get child support from the other parents. 

Some other examples of the fake pro-life stance include:
There has been a push to stop free school lunches as well as to defund public schools. 
The denial of science (vaccines, global climate change). 

I understand that the political movement of pro-life is about stopping abortions, and I agree. The goal isn’t about the care of the child after it’s born. That doesn’t mean you’re actually pro-life. 


If you actively vote for or create situations that are harmful to children and families, you aren’t literally pro-life; you’re pro-birth.

1lmtogd,Cmv: Democratic Party leaders are spineless and are responsible for the Trump regime.,"A Democrat politician was shot and killed in Minnesota with her husband by a right winger, Nancy Pelosi's home was invaded and her husband was bashed in the head with a hammer by a right winger, I've heard practically nothing. They do nothing to advocate for members of their own party, I see no justified rage, I see no action, no blame put onto republican politicians. These events are in the news for about a minute and then everyone forgets about it. 

Yet when Donald Trump gets shot in the ear by a right winger, the Republicans go off like rabid dogs in the media and blame rhetoric that came from the left and the Democrats BENT THE KNEE. The Democratic Party told their constituents to tone down their language for weeks despite valid criticism aimed at the Trump campaign. 

On top of that, Kamala Harris adopted Trump's immigration policy during the campaign and brought LIZ CHENEY on the road with her. She stopped talking about price gouging, they silenced progressive voices, they silenced Palestinian voices at the DNC, they did everything in their power to win over the imaginary moderate Republican voter. They betrayed their progessive base and expected them to fall in line due to lesser evil voting. Now seeing how much smoke Democrats have for Mamdani, I fear they have yet to learn their lesson.

Instead of countering right wing naratives, institutional Democrats have been adopting right wing talking points. Why would any Republican voter vote Democrat when for years, they've been on opposite sides of the spectrum? You come off as disingenuous when your go from ""No kids in cages"" to ""We can put kids in cages more humanely."" When you adopt right wing policies, when you campaign on having the strongest military in the world while supporting an active genocide, when you advocate for harsher immigration policies instead of talking about pathways to citizenship, DO NOT expect progressive voters to write you in out of obligation. That is a losing strategy. 

Biden's 2020 win came about after a disaterous Trump administration, Trump's 2024 win came about after not only a disasterous Biden administration but a disasterous and confusing Democratic campaign.

We know that temperament and ideology are heritable both in the form of social indoctrination, but also that literally someone's disposition and biology can lend itself to how religious or conservative they are. People rebel, but not as often as they don't.

All the doom cult of anti-natalism achieves is ensuring that over the next 100 years the majority in the west will have been raised in religious and conservative households and liberally temperamental people will have become a minority.

Also I don't see having a job or being employed as an inherent duty of a citizen, many jobs are truly miserable and if society is so efficient that it can provide to non-contributors, then they shouldn't feel compelled to find a job just because society tells them they have to work their whole life to earn the living that was imposed upon them.

Enter, UBI. I've seen a lot of arguments for it, but most of them stand opposite to my ideology and do nothing to counter it so they're largely ineffective.

""Everyone should do their fair share"" why? Why must someone suffer through labor under the pretense of covering a necessity that's not real, as opposed to strictly vocational motivations?

""It's untested""/""It won't work"" and we'll never know unless we actually try

""The politics won't allow it"" I don't care about inhuman politics, that's not an argument against UBI, that's an argument against a system that simply chooses not to improve the lives of the people because of an abstract concept like ""political will"".

Nothing is empowering about what she’s doing. In no way, shape, or form is selling bath water helping women. She's pandering to men and normalizing grotesque behaviors. 

The bath water campaign has a very similar, if not worse, damaging effect than porn. It reinforces in men’s minds that women are objects to be paid for, and discredits the actual work of the already suffering feminist movement by defending her behavior. 

The men are just as gross for buying it. There’s no justifying paying to use the bathwater of someone else. We all know how it’s going to be used, and so does Sydney. This entire campaign reinforces the already growing preconceived notion women have that men are lustful, dangerous, creeps.

1loeyan,CMV: The modern left’s outrage at the far-right disappears when the far-right is Islamic.,"My thesis is simple: The modern left condemns the far right in Europe and the United States relentlessly—whether it’s MAGA, the AfD, Viktor Orbán, or rising anti-immigrant movements. Yet that same energy is rarely, if ever, directed toward ideologies that are equally or more harmful, such as political Islam, hyper-conservative religious doctrines held by so-called “oppressed” groups, or radicals whose violence is cloaked in anti-Western grievances. I don’t know if this is because of Edward Said-like ideology being very common, but it’s just incredibly hypocritical and leads to a power vacuum in western countries’ discourse, allowing advantageous, right-wing ideologies like political Islam to take advantage of our moral agnosticism. 

This moral subjectivity, grounded in a reflexive loyalty to the perceived underdog, reveals that many leftists don’t actually stand for consistent principles at all. They stand for oppositional posturing—opposing whoever holds power, regardless of what replaces it.

The Israel–Palestine conflict illustrates this perfectly. In the early days of Israel’s existence, many Western leftists embraced it as a post-colonial, kibbutznik-style socialist experiment. Figures like Che Guevara visited. The USSR was among the first to recognize it. But once the balance of power shifted—once Israel was no longer the underdog—leftist support evaporated. The legitimate aims of Jewish self-determination became suspect, and every act of Israeli defense was rebranded as aggression. Meanwhile, Islamist movements with openly theocratic, supremacist, and regressive agendas were increasingly portrayed as “resistance. Whether it’s Hamas leadership saying civilian deaths/martyrdom are a necessary cost of war, or the land will be cleansed of the Jews (not the Zionists, mind you), it is completely ignored or undermined as being the “language of the oppressed”, or as justified hatred and “the resistance isn’t perfect”. 

Another key factor leftists ignore is the binding political structure of Islam. Unlike Christianity or Judaism, which has undergone centuries of theological reform and secularization or jurisprudence balancing today’s norms with that of 2000 years ago, Islam is considered the final, unalterable word of God. The Qur’an is viewed as perfect, eternal, and universally applicable, and the Sunnah—the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad are meant to be prescriptive. In many Muslim communities, especially in places like Bangladesh or Pakistan men literally model the length and color of their beards on Muhammad’s—keeping it a fist-length and dyeing it orange with henna, just as he reportedly did. If external grooming is emulated with such precision, what other commands—regarding governance, gender roles, punishment, or war—wouldn’t also be followed? This isn’t a fringe interpretation; it’s a mainstream, deeply rooted worldview, and pretending it’s merely a cultural variant or spiritual tradition—as many leftists do—is intellectual dishonesty at best, and dangerous appeasement at worst.",Significant_Tip_9123,526,1045,0.6399999856948853,0.1644270268451707,1751307480,/r/changemyview/comments/1loeyan/cmv_the_modern_lefts_outrage_at_the_farright/,2025,6,changemyview,2025-06-30 18:18:00

1lg9x41,cmv: Iran's possession of highly enriched Uranium is highly indicative of them seeking to develop a nuclear weapon.,"So, I believe that , people are either being willfully ignorant, or not understanding the relationship between highly enriched uranium and nuclear weapons. There is this concept that the two are totally separate things, which is false.

First, lets look at the [IAEA report on Iran](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/25/06/gov2025-24.pdf)

>3. Iran has estimated27 that at FFEP from 8 February to 16 May 2025:    
166.6 kg of UF6 enriched up to 60% U-235 were produced;  
 560.3 kg of UF6 enriched up to 20% U-235 were fed into the cascades;   
 68.0 kg of UF6 enriched up to 20% U-235 were produced  
  441.8 kg of UF6 enriched up to 5% U-235 were fed into cascades;   
 229.1 kg of UF6 enriched up to 5% U-235 were produced;   
396.9 kg of UF6 enriched up to 5% U-235 were accumulated as tails;   
 368.7 kg of UF6 enriched up to 2% U-235 were accumulated as tails;   
 98.5 kg of UF6 enriched up to 2% U-235 were accumulated as dump.

This means in 3 months , Iran produced 1/5 of a ton of highly enriched uranium . 

This is in addition to the 83.7% uranium detected at the Fordo facility which inspectors do not have access to [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/iran-announces-start-of-construction-on-new-nuclear-power-plant](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/iran-announces-start-of-construction-on-new-nuclear-power-plant)

Nuclear reactors for energy ONLY need 3-5% enriched Uranium

To put this into context of a relatable situation, say you have a neighbor, and one day, you notice that neighbor getting Ammonium Nitrate, say about 50 pounds of it, at their door step. Ammonium Nitrate is an explosive, which has been used for several large bombings, but is also a fertilizer. You ask the neighbor, why do they have this chemical compound? They say its for gardening. But their garden is small, 50 pounds of fertilizer is for large farms. 

The next week, you see another shipment of ammonium nitrate. This time, its even bigger. You ask the neighbor whats going on. They say, its for gardening and planting. 

Now, ammonium nitrate itself, isn't a bomb. You obviously need to build some sort of bomb to ignite it. But the separation between having large amounts of ammonium nitrate as a civilian vs making a bomb does not have a reasonable difference.

And I don't have much to show for it aside from a very basic lifestyle (studio apartment for $1250 a month, a 2010 Toyota Camry, and some basic savings such as 401k and emergency fund). 

When the system fails due to its own corruption, I won't be there to save it. That is not a threat or incitement of violence. Simply disengagement from a system that no longer works.

I'm even using my degree. I work in QA in these times of mass layoffs. On paper, I did everything right. Did I make some mistakes? Of course I did. Everyone does. But I also worked myself like a horse to the point where I neglected my health and relationships. And I'm done trying to thrive in a system that doesn't allow most to thrive. 

I'm not even planning to stop getting a better job. I'm just done expecting the job will give me the ""American dream"". 
 

In a glimer of hope, however, I do believe when the system crushes under its own weight, a enough people in America care about positive change enough where a better and more fair system will take its place. 

The core ideas of America won't die, but the government is screwed. ",conceredworker345,640,796,0.7400000095367432,0.143023608559343,1750355187,/r/changemyview/comments/1lfh523/cmv_we_should_stop_trying_to_win_in_a_system_that/,2025,6,changemyview,2025-06-19 17:46:27
1li0ee2,"CMV: Trump's refusal to actively prosecute large employers of illegal immigrants reveals he is not running his deportation campaign for security, economic, or moral reasons.","Okay. Here's the deal.

There is a clear and obvious reason why most illegal immigrants come to the United States. It's not because they just love stealing all of our welfare and eating people's cats. 

It is because big corporations hire them. 

The reasons they do this is obvious. It lets them get cheap labor. 

But Trump is not going after them (sample citation: [https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-18/immigration-raids-employer-employee](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-18/immigration-raids-employer-employee) ). Why?

Now, letting a bunch of people into the country without any vetting is bad. We can all agree on that. And every undocumented person who comes in and is sheltered by these big businesses is a potential security risk. But Trump has made no moves to patch this hole or massively penalize companies for making Americans less safe. Thus, either Trump's current deportation plan is not about national security, or he is being extremely stupid and ignoring a massive hole in our national defense.

Let's move on to money, where the inverse is the case.   
  
Far from being a resource sink, Illegal immigrants are actually major economic contributors (sample citations: [https://americansfortaxfairness.org/undocumented-immigrants-contribute-economy/](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/undocumented-immigrants-contribute-economy/) ; [https://cmsny.org/importance-of-immigrant-labor-to-us-economy/](https://cmsny.org/importance-of-immigrant-labor-to-us-economy/) ). They also work jobs that American workers quite frankly are not able to fill: (sample citation: [https://www.rawstory.com/trump-farmers-2672410822/?u=eb87ad0788367d505025d9719c6c29c64dd17bf89693a138a44670acfdc86a46&utm\_source=Iterable&utm\_medium=email&utm\_campaign=Jun.21.2025\_8.59pm](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-farmers-2672410822/?u=eb87ad0788367d505025d9719c6c29c64dd17bf89693a138a44670acfdc86a46&utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Jun.21.2025_8.59pm) ).

Now, if Trump wanted to keep all that money flowing into our economy, he could just ignore the issue or start a generous work visa program that vetted the people willing to come into the country and work for cheap while still letting them come in. He wouldn't be hunting them down with constant, expensive immigration raids. So this can't be about money. 

Finally we move to move on to morals. A lot of people think it's just immoral to cross the border illegally and thus break the law. Even if I don't agree I can accept that. 

But Trump is actively deporting people who are refugees due to US actions (sample citation: [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/afghanistan-trump-deportation-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/afghanistan-trump-deportation-threat) ). And human trafficking victims with essential jobs (sample citation [https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-teachers-aide-self-deports-with-us-born-twin-daughters/65089409](https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-teachers-aide-self-deports-with-us-born-twin-daughters/65089409) ). Those people never broke the law at all, and (generally speaking) committed no crimes. Thus there is no moral reason to deport them.

But do you know who is being immoral and breaking the law? Large companies that are aiding and abetting illegal immigrants instead of reporting them to the authorities. If this was about the immorality of breaking the law, then big companies would be causing way more moral harm than individual migrants. And they would be the primary targets. 

So with moral, economic and security reasons for the deportations out the window, the only reasons I can think of to conduct these massive raids is racism, security theater, and/or  as a cover for something else.

1l0x318,CMV: The term “Zio” has no place in left pro-Palestine activism and amounts to support for antisemitic white supremacy.,"The term “zio” is a well-documented product of white supremacist organizations  and leaders such as David Duke who notably popularized and mainstreamed the term. It is commonly used by neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers, and their allies. 

It is unfortunately now becoming popular among pro-Palestine activists who would likely identify themselves as left-aligned. 

I contend that this is damaging and undermining to left movements in general, and to the pro-Palestine movement specifically. 

I also contend that if someone uses the term despite knowing its origin and intent, they are intentionally platforming white supremacy and spreading white supremacist tropes. This can only benefit white supremacists and it certainly cannot be anti-racist or pro-Jewish in effect.

It is absolutely acceptable and IMO necessary to harshly criticize Zionism and self-described Zionists. Things like the IHRA definition of antisemitism are wrong and attempts to conflate antisemitism with anti-Zionism are a dishonest ploy to undermine the Palestine Liberation movement. And they are dangerous for Jews in general as they conflate Israel’s genocide and other crimes with Jewish identity in general. 

The term “Zio” was invented to do exactly the same thing. It makes the line between “Jew” and “Zionist” intentionally blurry to give cover to white supremacists who want to be able to openly denigrate Jews and avoid accountability. 

If there was a unique value to this term — if it expressed something that could not be communicated otherwise then perhaps you could argue that we should ignore its original purpose and accept that language evolves. 

However the entire premise of the term when used by supposed leftists is that it is “just” an abbreviation of “Zionist.” When used by white supremacists it is intended to mean “Jew.” 

So the *only* cost to a pro-Palestine activist in rejecting the term is typing four additional letters. If one means “Zionist,” then just say, “Zionist.” 

There cannot be any good reason for left pro-Palestine groups or communities to allow this term in their midst. Not only does it actively platform and spread white supremacist tropes, but it also creates space for hasbara plants and cointelpro agitators to discredit Palestine liberation activism and creates a barrier for anti-Zionist Jews and POCs who may understandably not feel safe around activists throwing around neo-Nazi terms. 

If, for example, you have a subreddit that has policies around hate speech, racist terminology, etc. you should absolutely have a policy against this term.

1ll1kuv,CMV: ICE workers and detention facility staff will become the next generation's shameful historical example of ordinary people enabling atrocities.,"I've been hearing reports of the conditions at Migrant facilities in the USA. They already have been terrible, but with the increased quota and lack of new infrastructure its going to get a whole lot worse.

Can it get worse than causing a Pregnant woman's 5 month old fetus to die and sit inside her for days? Absolutely. It is just a matter of time - time that the Trump administration has.

They have a minimum of 1.5 more years if Ds manage to take back the house and senate and frighteningly 3.5 more if they don't. This is more than enough time for atrocities to become normalized and have numbers rack up.

Maybe they will run out of money, but that hasn't stopped the USA from spending.

I believe that if this continues, the truth will eventually come out and there will be a lot of evidence that will eventually get shared. 

When stories come out, politicians will ask for people to be prosecuted. To my knowledge ICE does not have a special judicial system like the military, which can hide crimes because of special treatment. If Ds win the presidency, then the DOJ will prosecute everyone they can and I bet enough Rs will jump in to distance themselves from Trump that it could get bipartisan support.

In this scenario, most ICE agents will be identified and at the very least shunned by society and probably the world. Migrants will tell stories of specific people who abused them. I'm sure texts and conversations will be leaked. Paper trails of who abducted whom will be available. It will be hard to hide.

This all depends on whether or not Trump / Maga lose power and I have a feeling they will when the Trump admin's policies continue to hurt the working class. You can disagree, but with Iran, up-coming medicaid cuts, increased deficit spending for rich people, and higher prices it seems more and more likely.

1lgwxlh,"CMV: There will never be full peace between Israel and all of its neighbors and there is no ""solution"" to these conflicts","Would love for someone to change my view about this, because I feel somewhat hopeless. Basically as I see it:

\- From the Arab and Muslim point of view, there is too much religious and historic significance to the land, Jerusalem, and Al Aqsa. The temptation for a leader to try to become the next Saladin, the liberator of Jerusalem, unifier of the middle east and defeater of the western ""crusaders"" will always be too great. Even if some neighbors (like Jordan and Egypt) make peace, others (like Iran) will always see the demagogic opportunity to make Israel the enemy and to promise to recapture Jerusalem -- whether they mean it or are just using it to rally their people. Additionally, the defeat that the founding of Israel represents will always be a stain on regional and religious pride and a psychic wound that needs to be avenged.

\- From the Israeli/Jewish point of view, Israel and Jerusalem will also always have its significance as the center of the Jewish religion, the subject of many of its key prayers and literature, the location of all of its holy sites. And also, the modern state of Israel will always have strong emotional significance as a place of liberation for Jews, a haven, a place of strength, and the answer to Jews' own psychic wound of having been persecuted for hundreds of years in Europe and the Middle East. Not to mention the pride of having built the state that will make it hard to let go of.

Moreover, a majority of Israeli Jews will always see it as necessary to Israel's survival to maintain a Jewish majority in the state, and therefore will never be open to a single state in all of Israel/Gaza/WB, while Palestinians will never accept a state in just some of the land.

I don't see a solution to the tension between these contradictory forces/goals. I don't see a scenario where the entire Arab and Muslim world simultaneously chills out about Israel being there, and I don't see a scenario where Israel chills out about being threatened. If Iran falls, Turkey will take over the same role. If Israel looks weak, someone will pounce. If Israel is strong, it will try to destroy those who threaten it, which will only make some people more determined to destroy it. It just seems like a never-ending cycle, unless something shifts in the balance of power.

1ll42ps,"CMV: I’m fed up with uk tax system, I don’t think it’s fair.","Unpopular opinion, maybe, but I need to say this somewhere.

I earn over £100k, so I know I’m seen as “comfortable” — and I’m not here to claim I’m struggling to survive. But I do feel completely penalised and invisible in the current UK system, especially with all the talk about council tax reform and making high earners pay more.

I’m the sole earner in my household. My partner earns very little, and I cover everything: housing, food, childcare, bills. We live in a modest but decent house (which, apparently, now makes us “wealthy” again when it comes to council tax reform).

I don’t get any help. No child benefit. No 30 hours childcare. No universal credit. And if I earn between £100–125k, I get caught in a 60% marginal tax trap because of the loss of personal allowance. That’s before student loans or pension deductions.

I’m not asking for pity — I know others have it worse. But what frustrates me is the lack of nuance in how we talk about fairness. It’s assumed that people in my bracket are coasting. We’re not.

We’re heavily taxed, not eligible for support, and now expected to pick up even more of the tab with things like council tax reform — while many genuinely wealthy people who live off investments or own multiple properties get away with paying proportionally much less.

I feel like I’m being punished for being the “easy” kind of person to tax. My income is visible, trackable, and not sheltered offshore.

I’m not against supporting those in need — quite the opposite. I want a strong safety net and a fairer system. But what I don’t understand is why there’s no space in the conversation for people like me, who are working hard, carrying a household, and feeling like there’s no upside to earning more.

Curious if anyone else here feels this “silent squeeze” too. Maybe you can make me see this differently.

His co-author, Derek Thompson, is staunchly anti-union ([in his own words from 2012](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/unnecessary-and-political-why-unions-are-bad-for-america/258405/); and sections in the book *Abundance* that puts the blame on unions--not oligarchs).

This might be unpopular but I don't think the people who spread that meme around were ever centrists to begin with. 

See I'm not ignorant to how mean and judgy leftists can be. Infighting is extremely common for a reason. We all have a lot of conviction in our beliefs and some of us tend to interpret different viewpoints as opposing viewpoints. But that's not what I'm talking about here. Because I've had many shitty arguments with self proclaimed leftists and never once has it encouraged me to take on conservative beliefs. 

I genuinely can't imagine the kind of person who has such little moral fiber that they'd reactively change their beliefs at the first instance of pushback. Hell even after many instances of pushback. Leftists love to debate, so you'd also get many reasonable and compelling arguments from them, even if it's 90% vitriol. It'd be one thing if they just doubled down, but these people are saying they changed their beliefs in opposition to the people they were arguing with. It's hard to believe a legitimately open minded person would only absorb from this experience that 'leftist bad.'

And then you take into account the flaming vile words and actions taken by the right. How did hearing 'jews will not replace us.' on national TV not push you to the left then? Did you really never get into a heated argument with a conservative? I've been called slurs a vast number of times, both online and irl, just for arguing with conservatives. And while that specifically isn't a universal experience, the level of vitriol coming from them too great to deny. 

I think most everyone, if not everyone who claims they were a centrist till some leftists pushed them to the right, were actually right wingers the entire time, larping as an enlightened centrist until their right wing beliefs got called out and they doubled down.

1m18iia,CMV: Reddit does a fairly good job of pushing men toward the political right,"I’ve noticed over the years that Reddit, despite leaning heavily liberal/progressive in most of its mainstream subreddits, often ends up pushing young men, especially those who feel isolated or frustrated, further toward the political right. I don’t mean Reddit is intentionally doing this, but the way certain ideas dominate discussion while others are aggressively shut down creates a pipeline effect.

Here’s why I believe this happens:

1. **Blatant misandry is tolerated, even celebrated.** There are threads and comments (often upvoted) that generalize men as toxic, dangerous, lazy, incompetent, or inherently privileged. If someone dares to push back, even with nuance, they often get downvoted or banned. This can create resentment, especially in young men who already feel invisible or villainized.
2. **Censorship of alternative views.** While Reddit prides itself on open discourse, many subs (r/politics, r/TwoXChromosomes, r/AskWomen, etc.) have strict moderation policies that lean left. Posts offering centrist or mildly conservative takes often get removed or massively downvoted, which only fuels the sense that right-leaning voices are being silenced rather than debated.
3. **Echo chambers amplify bitterness.** When men express frustration with societal or gender dynamics, they’re told to “cope,” “be better,” or “shut up.” They are called incels and misogynists. So instead of being heard, they’re mocked. Hence they leave or retreat to smaller communities and even some anti-feminist or redpill-adjacent spaces where they feel validated. These can sometimes push them further right over time.
4. **“Progressivism” is increasingly associated with double standards.** Many men see Reddit pushing for empathy, compassion, and equality, but only selectively. For example, if a woman slaps a man in a viral video, the top comment is often laughter or justification. Flip the genders, and it’s outrage.

1m7dy75,"CMV: Even if there’s definitive proof Trump is a pedophile via Epstein files, it won’t change MAGA or GOP support for him.","Here’s my reasoning: Republicans didn’t change course after countless mass shootings, even when kids were killed in classrooms. They’ve shown that no level of tragedy or moral outrage will make them abandon their positions if it threatens their political power.

So, I don’t see why concrete proof of Trump being a pedophile would make a difference. His base is fiercely loyal, and GOP leadership has a track record of closing ranks instead of holding him accountable.

My view is that, at most, a few moderates might peel off, but overall, his support would remain largely intact, and the Republican Party wouldn’t dump him. The culture war narrative would just spin it as a “deep state setup” or an attack by the left, like everything else.

1meh8rd,"CMV: “My Body, My Choice” Is a Terrible Argument for Pro-Choice When Addressing Pro-Life Audiences","CMV: I think “my body, my choice” is one of the worst arguments a pro-choice person can use when speaking to someone who is pro-life. I’m not saying it is morally wrong to believe in bodily autonomy, or that abortion should or shouldn’t be legal. I’m saying that if the goal is to engage with people who hold pro-life beliefs and actually change their minds, this slogan completely misses the point of where they are coming from.

Here’s why. Many people who are pro-life sincerely believe that abortion is equivalent to taking a human life. In their eyes, the fetus is not just part of your body, it is a separate, developing human being with its own moral status and right to life. You can disagree with that view, but you cannot ignore it if you want to actually persuade them. When you say “my body, my choice,” what they hear is something like “I have the right to end another human life because it’s inconvenient for me.” That’s not a strawman, that’s genuinely how many of them interpret the argument.

Imagine if someone said “my house, my rules” as a justification for killing a 14-year-old who lived with them. That would be horrifying, right? To many pro-life people, the fetus is no different than a child. They see it as vulnerable, innocent, and in need of protection. Saying “my body, my choice” to them sounds no better than “my life, my choice” in defense of harming someone else who is dependent on you.

This doesn’t mean the pro-choice position is invalid. But if the objective is persuasion or productive discussion, this argument fails hard. It refuses to engage with the actual moral premise of the pro-life position. And because of that, it comes across as dismissive, selfish, and disconnected from the core issue. Instead of fostering dialogue, it creates a wall.

So CMV: If your goal is to actually reach pro-life people and not just preach to those who already agree with you, “my body, my choice” is not just ineffective, it’s counterproductive. You cannot change someone’s mind if you refuse to address the thing they care about most.

If they are, so what? Israel is clearly dominating this ""war"" and destroying Hamas on all fronts, Hamas pretty much stands no chance and is fighting for survival now. Israel is much more funded and powerful than Hamas could ever be. How could this money they generate from selling food even fund them further?

1lyiqhx,CMV: Everything contrapoints said was true and the left needs to stop eating itself.,"Unless you've been living under a rock, the current political discourse surounding contrapoints at the moment and people calling her a Nazi/genocidal apologist is legitimately insane. 

She is right and her views are based in reality. 

Israel is a nuclear armed state with the backing of the US. It is not going anywhere. There will never be a Palestinian utopia. The absolute best case scenario is a 2 state solution. And by definition, if you support a 2 state solution you are a Zionist. We do not need to support Israel, but we have to recognise the fact that it’s not going anywhere and we have to deal with that. Any possible solution will involve the existence of Israel as a state.

What she was referring to as a ""doomed cause"" - is the left's obsession with the complete dissolution of Israel as a state (and the subsequent displacement of millions of Jews). This is never going to happen. We need to put our energy into solutions that are actually feasible. 

Also pointing out that there has been a steep increase in antisemitism real wide does not make you a Zionist. You can be both critical of the mass genocide and displacement of Palestinian people - while also recognising that a raise in antisemitism and the calling for the mass displacement of Jews is a very slippery slope (sound familiar?). Not to mention that a world wide increase in antisemitism fuels Israel's absolutetism regarding Israel as the only real ""safe haven"" for all Jews and that must be protected and armed at all costs. It is counterproductive to the Palestinian course. 

Isn't the point of being left leaning calling out injustices everywhere? And believe it or not, Jews outside of Israel experiencing antisemitism is still an injustice.

1mcat6d,CMV: The USA is in an Inescapable Death Spiral,"We are in a political death spiral in the USA, there is no mechanism that can stop it.

Back in the day, the parties were looser ideologically. Politics were divided along regional as well as party lines. The consequences of this weren't always great (the Solid South enabling Jim Crow) but they did enable compromise. That's no longer the case, as the parties are now wholly constituted based on their ideologies.

The results of this has been legislative deadlock. Congress can barely pass anything. Once rare measure like the filibuster are now employed routinely. Look at the recent BBB- it had to be passed via budget reconciliation to get around the filibuster. There is no longer any political cost to dirty tricks (think Merrick Garland), and no advantage in compromise.

And so we come to the death spiral. With the legislature useless, both parties have been ceding more and more power to the executive. The stakes for who controls the presidency are now existential. With the precedent of the criminal prosecutions of Donald Trump and this new talk of the DOJ prosecuting Obama, there's a sense that, if a president loses control, they could now face jail or worse. This ""lawfare"" disincentivizes the incumbent from peacefully giving up power. I can't think of a better way to speedrun the death spiral.

1lz40a3,"CMV: Conservative outrage blasting the Superman movie for being ""woke"" due to its pro-immigrant message proves that the anti-woke movement is pure ignorance","The first issue of Superman originally came out in 1938, and was widely credited for single-handedly creating the entire comic-book genre. 

One of the biggest themes when Superman first came out was portraying immigrants as people who could become the symbol of what is means to ne American. Especially due to what was going on in 1938. 

Fast forward to today, and the new Superman movie is being blasted by conservative figureheads for being ""woke"" due to its pro-immigrant message. 

Not even going to touch that Superman has been used as a figure to condemn racism and xenophobia, which is partially what it means to be woke.  Heck within the first 10 years of its existence, Superman was depicted taking on the KKK.

Being pro-immigrant and anti-racist in the 1930's and 40's is super duper mega woke in that era. 

Even going further, in the 1950's, Superman was used in conjunction with black activists to target racism and segregation, with even official government posters as well (partly why Superman and Batman have a No-Kill policies). 

The fact that conservatives are calling the new Superman movie ""woke"", proves that the anti-woke movement is completely based on ignorance at the least, and bigotry and the worst. Especially since they didn't know that Superman ALWAYS had a ""woke"" message.

1m6y4el,"CMV: The modern conservative movement in the US can be accurately, not hyperbolically, described as fascist","When I describe the modern conservative movement, a lot of it will have to do with Trump and his movement, MAGA, which maintains widespread support among conservatives and controls much of the country right now, so saying ""I'm a conservative and I disagree with these things"" won't really change my view. 

Trump and MAGA are a near perfect example of a modern fascist movement. Trump rose to power on a wave of populism, attacking the elites who he viewed as effeminate and targeting masculinity and traditional values. Immigrants are scapegoated, viewed as a tool of these elites, brought to the country as part of their efforts to destroy the US. 

Conservatives have embraced autocracy and believe that the only way to defeat these elites is by empowering Trump as a sort of benevolent dictator, who will do whatever it takes, including violating laws and the constitution and human rights, to bring us back to a mythologized past where ""the real Americans"", Trump's supporters, MAGA, maintain a sort of special status. There's a strong and well documented cult of personality surrounding Trump, where conservatives will completely change their claimed ideals and beliefs depending on what Trump is doing at the time. 

Trump is against the constitution, frequently violating the constitution to target freedom of speech, imprisoning immigrants for writing op eds he doesn't like, using executive orders to try to change the constitution through executive overreach, deporting US citizens. He's effectively turning the country into a police state where anyone can be stopped, detained, and imprisoned at any time for any reason without warrant or cause. In response to protests in LA, he took control of the state national guard and deployed the military on US soil, against states rights, against the wishes of the state and city, and his administration has said that the military will stay until they oust the democratically elected state and city governments. 

Trump has become obsessed with expansionism and protectionism, is strongly illiberal, opposed to democracy, tried to overturn one election, pardoned convicted seditionists that violently tried to help him seize power, and has created an uneasy alliance between extremist militia groups and other extremists, Christian fundamentalists, and traditional elites. He tries to exert strong personal control over basically every aspect of the country and the economy, personally threatening corporate elites unless they demonstrate loyalty (Zuckerberg, Musk, etc.), threatening political opposition with imprisonment, stripped citizenship, and deportation, targeting and threatening journalists for writing about his administration, targeting lawyers who defend clients against his administration, and on and on. 

What I've described here is an ideology that's called fascism. I'm saying that Trump is a fascist, and his supporters are falling for fascism. I'm not exaggerating or using it as simply an insult, I understand what fascism is. Fascism doesn't mean ""killed 11 million people,"" such a definition would suggest that Franco and Mussolini and even Hitler, prior to the final solution, were not fascists. It does not mean ""literally Hitler"". Pointing out that though Trump is dismantling due process in the US and sending people to foreign concentration camps where they'll be tortured, but hey, at least they're not gas chambers, isn't a refutation. 

I'm talking about generally understood historical facts of fascism, the common elements of fascism, which Trump and his movement share. This isn't partisan hyperbole, people from all over the political spectrum acknowledge that Trump is a fascist. Conservatives who oppose Trump acknowledge he's a fascist. Well respected generals who worked with Trump directly have said that he's a fascist. Historians who quite literally wrote the book on fascism are calling Trump a fascist. The fascists know Trump is a fascist and support him, and the anti fascists know Trump is a fascist and oppose him. 

But for some reason, there's this weird group in the middle that demands that we walk on eggshells, that we should *never* use the word fascist, even to accurately describe a fascist movement. If you just don't like the word fascist for whatever reason, fine, we can call it a far right extremist ideology that's strongly illiberal, opposed to the concept of human rights and limited government, authoritarian in nature, and oppressive, and all the other shared pieces. That's fine. But it doesn't change the fact that we're talking about, that this movement is fascist, that this is what people post WW2 spent decades trying to understand and prevent from happening again, because it is intensely harmful. 

I think that a lot of people who have trouble accepting this first, don't actually know what fascism is, and think that fascism means ""killed 11 million people,"" or ""literally Hitler"", or it's just an insult. Secondly, many know that fascism is *bad*, this is deeply ingrained in them, but... They like what fascism *is*, they like what Trump is doing, so, they can't acknowledge that they're supporting or defending fascism. 

For some other views you can dive into as a bit of a side component, Trump and the modern conservative movement are opposed to the fundamental values that the country was formed to protect. Trump has gotten people so riled up and scared about immigrants through dehumanization and demonization, that his supporters are willing to dismantle our basic human rights as long as we keep harming them. Not just undocumented immigrants either, Trump is targeting immigrants who legally came to the country, who broke no laws. He's targeting children born in the US, who are US citizens, and wants to deport them to countries they've never been to. He's sending people to brutal, inhumane concentration camps in El Salvador and Sudan without due process and completely needlessly, and many of these people were legally in the US when imprisoned. Most have never been convicted of a crime. 

All of this is very, very bad. Human rights are important. People have forgotten these things. They've forgotten things we swore we wouldn't forget. Like, for example, that a fascist may be going after a group that does not include you now, but that will expand, and you yourself may find yourself sent to the concentration camps. Your rights will be violated. Even the early supporters of fascism found themselves purged, murdered, exiled, etc. 

Whether or not you're willing to call this fascism I consider rather unimportant. What Trump is doing is harmful. We know it's harmful. We've seen it play out over and over again. The benevolent dictator is something of a myth. He might be hurting the people you want him to hurt now, but fascists are always making enemies. 

Some other points: telling me I've been ""watching too much MSNBC"" isn't going to change my view. I don't watch MSNBC, and attacking every journalist or news source that says something negative, but true, isn't a good refutation of anything. 

The statements of fact I've made, like that Trump is targeting legal immigrants and refugees and political opposition and journalists and lawyers and that he tried to overturn an election and pardoned convicted seditionists, these are facts. They happened, regardless of what news sources you watch.

1mdyofz,CMV: The killing of Corporate Executives (or other wealthy elites) is a facet of class warfare equivalent or lesser than cutting critical services.,"**This is not a post advocating for violence.**

Recently Wesley LePatner, an executive for Blackstone who oversaw a $53 billion dollar real-estate investment fund, was killed by an armed shooter. This attack was less clearly motivated than the killing of healthcare executive Brian Thomson. However it does mark the 2nd high profile executive that was killed in recent memory. 

Currently in the United States, the bottom 50% of households hold less than 4% of the national wealth. A significant portion of which is held by the top of that 50%, because many people towards the bottom of that range have less than nothing, just debt. Many of these people rely on social services like Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, just to survive. 

It's not an exaggeration to say that many of these people's lives are held at the mercy of wealthy individuals' whims. So when someone like Brian Thompson makes a policy choice that he knows will lead to thousands of people to be denied potential life saving medical care, or a real-estate mogul raises rent for the 5th consecutive time knowing families will be homeless, they are aware that their actions will kill people. 

I don't see how the targeted killing of individuals with this kind of power is fundamentally different than someone knowingly taking their lives. The only true difference is that the wealthy elite uses a policy change instead of a gun, and is protected by a few layers of separation. In the end though, both parties are making choices with the full knowledge that it will kill or ruin someone's life.

I'd even argue that many policy chocies made by the elite are worse comparatively, due to the scope of harm caused. Things like cuts to USAID or the NIH will touch the lives of exponentially more people than any individual murder.

Folks are already poo-pooing Newsom and he hasn't even announced - he's pure goodness and honesty compared to Trump's ilk and yet we will see folks abstain because he's also imperfect... just like Trump's replacement.

1mbtt5j,CMV: People Are Overreacting To Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle Ad,"For those who don't know, Sydney Sweeney is facing allegations of Nazism for her American eagle ad, in which she says ""my genes/jeans are blue."" which is a play on the phrase blue jeans and on the fact that she has blue eyes and blonde hair, people are taking this as glorification of the Aryan race and propaganda towards Nazism.

Media literacy has drastically declined over the years. There is nothing in this ad that promotes Nazism or glorifies the Aryan race. People are constantly overanalyzing everything, just looking for something to be upset about.

Meanwhile, we have people dying in ICE custody, being ripped away from their homes, and this is what we choose to be angry over?

Let's focus on real issues and stop getting distracted by internet misdirections. We need to stop mistaking outrage bait for activism.

I feel like people are overreacting because the advertisement doesn't show any hidden agenda, the ad is very straightforward as a promotion for American Eagle jeans, which is a *Jewish* owned brand. why would a Jewish owned brand be actively advocating and supporting Nazism?

1m5ukdm,"CMV: Christians, based on their own teachings, should lean left politically.","This is based on a few verses.

First of which (and the strongest pointer, in my opinion) would be the Parable of Sheep and Goats. Jesus is essentially saying that the treatment of the lowest in society should be of the same quality as the treatment we would give to Jesus himself, and we would be rewarded with eternal glory. Neglect of the lowest in society is the same as neglecting Jesus, and, thus, you should burn in eternal damnation. 

Then there's Proverbs 30:8-9. ""Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me, lest I be full and deny you and say, “Who is the Lord?” or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God."" It seems like they are saying that we should only take what we need, and we should provide for those who have need. It, certainly, seems to show a distaste for those who live in luxury while others suffer.

1 Corinthians 10:24, ""Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor"" This seems to be stating that we should provide for others and others will provide for us. 

Deuteronomy 14:28-29, ""At the end of every three years you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in the same year and lay it up within your towns. And the Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance with you, and the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your towns, shall come and eat and be filled, that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands that you do."" AKA you should feed those who you owe nothing to and you will rewarded. 

1 Corinthians 12:26 ""If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together."" We exist as a collective, and should only suffer if it is together, and work together towards a common good. 

James 5:1-20 ""Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days. Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, are crying out against you, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter"" 

I think you get the point. The Bible oftentimes points to this idea of working towards a greater good regardless of personal reward or suffering. I feel like this is very in line with my personal ideals (to be brief, Libertarian Socialist) of providing welfare to those in need and providing tools for the people who are down on their luck to pull themselves up with. Additionally, I believe that these verses strongly frown on those that see somebody suffering and kind of shrug and say, ""not my problem,"" as many right-wing people would say about welfare issues, as well as frowning on people who hoard wealth in general.

I guess, to change my views you would need to show that A) the left does not actually align itself to the passages stated (and there are more that I left unstated) B) that the ideals above are not actually contradicted by right-wing policies C) that I am misinterpreting the verses above, and the more reasonable interpretation aligns more with right-wing policies or D) IDK, if I knew all the ways I could change my opinion, I wouldn't be here.

I get that Israel's a liberal democracy which is cool, but they also do a lot of questionable stuff and I don't understand why our taxes go towards supporting that. It also feels very weird to be paying a country which is spent 7 million dollars on a super bowl ad, and spends other money advocating for itself in our country. Seems like bad incentive setup.

I think important context is that the US does a lot of foreign aid in general which I don't understand someone let me know if [this site](https://foreignassistance.gov/) tells the whole story, but if this is accurate we give 3 billion to Israel, but we also give 1.5 billion to Egypt which no one talks about, probably also a questionable state I imagine if I were to look into it.

1m5xlfs,CMV: Most complaints from older women about feeling “invisible” to society are simply beautiful women experiencing the natural process of aging.,"I remember watching the first season of the Golden Bachelor with my gf at the time and listening to the different female contestants on the show talking about their experiences as women “past their pretty years” and how they feel society ignores them. But not just them, I work in a  career field with a lot of women and I’ve overheard scattered bits and pieces from others women discussing similar problems. 

If you’ll allow me to paraphrase a somewhat famous aphorism that goes “To those with privilege, equality often feels like injustice”, I feel like that’s very applicable here. Older women, like women in general, deal with a lot of poor treatment from men who don’t respect or understand the aging process. And historically men’s investment in women they’re not related to decreases in proportion to their age and attractiveness. 

But the experience of being unseen isn’t  unique among older women nor would I argue is it even the objectively worst part of dating. To put it crudely, these women had the luxury of being one of the prettiest people in the room from their childhood to at least their mid 40’s. Now, they’re starting to get treated like the rest of us average folk, men and women alike. 

That’s not unfairness that’s just a leveling of the fields. Compare that with the experience of average men/women as they age. They start out not getting noticed and then as they age, they get truly invisible. It’s even worse for the ugly ones. Men don’t care and women still have the threat of sexual assault hanging over their heads for the rest of their lives so they’re even less likely to see or try and see those men either.

Strange, ugly men weeping or looking sad in the streets attract less sympathy on the whole then any lady. It’s why it’s far more common for homeless women to receive help and *not* be seen on the streets as opposed to homeless men. 

As a final point, I’d just say that the women who feel invisible aren’t invisible in the ways average people are. They’re invisible relative to a beautiful girl half their age in the same room, but relative to their generation and age group, they’re still beautiful and have access to a form of pretty privilege that average or ugly seniors can/will never have.

1m46t1p,"CMV: The only right to a piece of land is by the sword. The whole ""who came first"" debate is just indoctrination for the masses","I come from the Balkans. The hobby of our ultra-nationalists here is to try and justify who came first to the region. 

While we generally know this, the reality is that ethnic groups were formed after the arrival of these groups in the region. All ethnic groups here, while in fact having a sort of genetic continuity, are in no way direct descendants of one single ethnic group, whose culture hasn't been the same since time immemorial. We are all mixed to some extent, and the labels of ""Serb"" ""Albanian"" or whatever other group have existed for centuries, while actually having different connotations. 

I do acknowledge that colonialism and atrocities took place, this is obvious. I don't believe we should forget them, we should talk about them so that we might never repeat them (in theory...). 

In this sense, I do believe that the ""post-colonial"" thinking of ""taking back"" whatever land was taken from you is not morally good or morally bad, it just defends certain interests. These debates often just digress forever and fuel the violence machine. At the end, as history shows, whoever has the biggest and best guns wins, the rest is just wrapping. 

I am generally pro-Palestinian because I believe that you should not indeed flatten a whole region indiscriminately in the hope that it will solve anything.

But I have to admit that I have been watching with a sort of amusement the whole ""Israelis are colonisers, Palestinians are indigenous people"" debate. 

While Zionism is a pure nationalist idea (unless you believe in Jewish Bronze Age fairytales, in that case, ok God promised them the land), there is no denial that all Jewish groups have some sort of genetic connection to the Levant. 

While ""Palestinian"" is a new-ish ethnic label, the local Arab Palestinians are no invaders but Arabised remnants of the local populations. 

Now, in my honest opinion, if Palestinians had the guns and international support the Israelis had, they would not hesitate for a single second to do the same thing to them. Israelis are not inherently evil and Palestinians pure or vice versa, it's just that the balance of power and PR is in their favour and has been for a while. There is no ""inherently evil European colonialist"". 

Who are the Palestinians to blame for their demise? The current Israeli government? Sure, many of them are brainwashed to the core. But who should they blame first? Their own forefathers that sold the land? The Ottoman government that allowed the Zionists to settle? Their own leadership which is corrupt? 

If the Palestinians want ""their"" land back, they have to get it by the sword. Easy in theory. The whole ""from the river to the sea"" thing is just propaganda to rally the masses. But the underlying legitimacy is only gained by force. 

To counter this, it is obviously pure nonsense ny Zionists to say that God gave them the land and expect the Palestinians to give them sweets on arrival. Even if the Jews have a genetic link to the land, that gives them 0 right to get it back, unless they get it by force (which they did). In that case, it has nothing to do with the whole promised land shtick.

To end, it amuses me to see Western leftists defend to the bone the ""indigenous right"" of some  ""indigenous"" people to a piece of land. In this case they're only described as ""indigenous"" because they were ""one with nature"" or had no leader, or because they were there just before the Europeans came. Why doesn't anyone tell the Navajos to go back to Canada? Or the Nahuatl to stop the Inca Empire? 

It is like when the Samis are often described as the ""only indigenous people of Europe"". Are they indigenous just because they lived in huts and look remotely Mongolian? Even though they probably settled there after the Germanic people? 

Why aren't the Polish indigenous? Or the Albanians? Should we give back the whole of Iberia to the Basque? 

These types of thought processes are rightfully rejected as bullshit and childlish whenever we see them from the Balkans. We reject them as memes, as a rightful object of mockery. How can these Albanians pretend they're Illyrian, they're all mixed lol, primitive Balkaners.

If a remotely brown people group lays claim to a piece of land, not only they are immediately accepted, the type of blood and soil jingoism rejected in the Balkans is made into dogma, inscribed in a ""post-colonial"" school of thought in reputed Western academia.

1lvhpet,cmv: The Supreme Court allowing Trump to Challenge the Constitution is the most Dangerous thing Happening Right Now.,"So I am a never Trump Republican. One of my core values is that the constitution, while imperfect, has to stand to the letter. This doesn't mean you can't ratify it, it was meant to be, but if the legislature won't amend it then it needs to be followed to the letter of the law. 

Lately, the Supreme Court has issued a couple rulings that I think are absolutely insane in reference to the Trump admin and their challenging of the constitutional protections granted to people in the United States. 1) The ruling to pause all injunctions on Trump deporting people to foreign countries without allowing them to contest, 2) The pause on the injunction against birthright citizenship. 

Both of those appear to be pretty obviously ingrained in the constitution the same way our right to bear arms is, and yet the supreme court casually allowed this administration to push them while delaying an ACTUAL ruling on the subject matter. This is a tactic that seems specifically aimed to allow the court to delay, or even worse set the groundwork to allow the president to violate clear wording in the constitution. 

In my recollection, we've always had the supreme court stand pretty close to the most literal reading of the constitution and for the first time ever it appears they are about to rule against clear wording. The premise that the president may be able to act in defiance of a literalist constitution without a judicial check is probably the most concerning development in my lifetime, and I'd like someone to either A) convince me that the fourteenth amendment doesn't actually grant birthright citizenship, convince me that the due process statement in the constitution doesn't apply to all people in the US (this specifically doesn't say citizens), or B) convince me that this isn't the Supreme Court taking an anti-constitutional approach to rulings and that the core document of our republic is still being respected by the highest court.

1m1f9et,CMV: Nobody (practically) actually thinks a fetus/embryo is equivalent to a human life. 99.99% of those who say this are lying to support a position they hold for other reasons.,"Anyone who says that they feel abortion is killing a human this is lying to you. They don't really think that.

**Note- Semantic edge case which is NOT what I am talking about outlined at the end.**

Well, I should be careful about saying ""anyone"". There are 8 billion people in the world. Maybe someone out there really does think they are the same, but for all practical intents and purposes, nobody really does, that is just a line of baloney they use to justify their opposition to abortion. 

We don't have obituaries for miscarriages.

We don't have funerals for miscarriages.

While of course many miscarriages are very tragic for the expectant parent, there are millions, tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of miscarriages every year that are no big deal, or that the woman doesn't even notice, and in fact many are even celebrated. 

Even in cases where the miscarriage is tragic, the parents and the family and the community doesn't mourn it like they would a lost infant. 

If anyone were in a situation where they had to choose between saving one single actual child versus a cooler with say 500 embryos (assuming a scenario where the embryos could be immediately secured and would survive), all of us, in fact almost every human on this planet, would save the child over the embryos without even the faintest whisper of a second thought.

  
Nobody actually thinks of a fetus/embryo as being equal to a human life. The singular and only context where they say this is in the context of compelling women to bear children, or eliminating their ability to voluntarily abort, that is voluntarily miscarry, something that happens ALL THE TIME naturally. In every other context, the death of the born and the unborn are treated as being quite different. 

**Semantic Edge Case- You might have someone out there who tries to argue ""Well, it IS human life, but it's a lesser category of human life that still counts as human but doesn't get the same considerations as fully born persons. Which is why we don't mourn them the same, and don't prioritize them the same."". And ok, fair enough, but that's not really what I am talking about. A person who believes the unborn are human life but of a lesser status and with fewer legal and moral consideration tied to them, I probably actually agree with that person. That's not really what I'm talking about here. I am talking about those who make the argument that they are human in the context of the abortion debate and that they should get the same legal protections and moral considerations as born humans.**

1mcnslq,CMV: Conservatives strongly overestimate Democrat loyalty to their elected officials,"My reasoning: Ever since the Epstein files came out and Trump had been accused of being on them, the immediate retort from MAGA conservatives is “Clinton was there too+mentions of Obama, Biden, Hilary, etc.”

1. Anyone who was born after 1980ish ( so anyone roughly younger than 50) just doesn’t  care about Clinton mainly because he didn’t impact their lives in ways they can likely recall. Left-leaning people of this generation are more familiar with someone like Obama.

2. While liberals may have the rep of “blue no matter who”, as someone who has been left-leaning their whole life, one of the most frustrating things about the group is how hyper critical they are. In the previous election, my personal theory is Kamala lost due to not being “radical” enough and being constantly criticized by the left base for not being left enough. Everyone’s entitled to their own theories, but I just say this as an example that candidates aren’t just worshipped blindly by left leaning people, and are seen more as a better alternative to their agenda. In other words, they didn’t just accept her(or anyone’s) candidacy without criticism after.

3. On another point, liberals are socially famous for “cancelling” people. Right or wrong, this also applies to politicians too. All it takes is someone saying the wrong thing and it’s “so you support x issue ?” Or “they didn’t post about x so they must hate x community”. In other words, left leaning loyalties are brittle and easily broken. AOC, as a more recent example, is heavily criticized for not voting the way her constituents want.

3. Democrats don’t take it personally when you insult democrat leaders, including Obama. In fact, I’d wager if you asked a sample of Obama voters their opinion on him now, a good chunk of them would say something akin to “I liked him, but he didn’t do enough or yeah he’s just like other politicians.” Meanwhile, any direct criticism of Trump draws out his supporters as if they had been personally attacked. No one is losing sleep over Biden or Clinton going to jail. 

All this to say, if your response to the E.F. Is” Well what about Clinton” , I promise you nobody on this side cares. Bill or Hilary. Obama might get more of a reaction but I promise no one’s gonna try to overthrow the government or stay loyal if any or all of them are implicated.

1m1e1a8,"CMV: We shouldn’t keep excusing harmful practices just because they’re part of a religion, including Islam","I believe that harmful practices shouldn’t be protected or tolerated just because they’re done in the name of religion, and that this especially applies to Islam, where criticism is often avoided out of fear of being labeled Islamophobic. To be clear, I’m not saying all Muslims are bad people. Most Muslims I know are kind, peaceful, and just trying to live decent lives. But I am saying that some ideas and practices that exist in Islamic law, culture, or tradition, such as apostasy laws, women’s dress codes, punishments for blasphemy, or attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people, are deeply incompatible with modern human rights values. In many countries where Islam is the dominant religion, these practices are not fringe. They are law. People are imprisoned or even killed for things like leaving the religion, being gay, or criticizing the Prophet. And yet, in the West, many of us are so concerned with respecting Islam that we won’t criticize these ideas openly, even when they violate the same values we would condemn in other contexts. If a Christian group said women need to cover up or they’ll tempt men into sin, most people I know would call that sexist. But if it’s a Muslim community saying the same thing, suddenly it’s “cultural” or “their tradition.” Why do we have double standards?

I think avoiding this conversation out of fear or political correctness just enables oppression, especially of women, ex-Muslims, and queer people within Muslim communities. I also think it does a disservice to the many Muslims who want reform and are risking their safety to call out these issues from within.

So my view is this: Respecting people is not the same as respecting all their ideas. We can and should critique harmful religious practices, including those found in Islam, without being bigoted or racist.",Mysterious_Role_5554,1709,695,0.8299999833106995,0.2435176125244618,1752676099,/r/changemyview/comments/1m1e1a8/cmv_we_shouldnt_keep_excusing_harmful_practices/,2025,7,changemyview,2025-07-16 14:28:19
1lyo4fr,CMV: Epstein files scare Trump for reason(s) other than the fact Trump himself is in them.,"For anyone apart from the most deluded cult members it is obvious and public knowledge that Trump is in the files, flight logs and had a close relationship with Epstein.  

Anything that is worse than that could be easily destroyed or covered up well enough for the all too willing cult to accept the Fox news spin of it and move on. Teflon Don has managed to get his following to accept so much already he could certainly find some way to spin his relationship with Epstein such that they would contort themselves to believe even the most ridiculous excuse. 

The way Trump, Bondi and other are handling this now is digging themselves into a massive hole and that screams that there is a far bigger risk. 

I DON'T think Trump is primarily worried about his own inclusion.  I think the bigger problem is dozens of other powerful paedophiles he is somehow obliged to protect.  

I think others that are on the list or in the evidence have a lot more risk than Trump does, as he is essentially immune to investigations, lawsuits, divorce and can brush off a lot of public scrutiny and he has the full power of the DOJ to illegitimately defend him or shut down threats. 

Given how many times Trump was on the flights, at the island and cohorting with Epstein over many years he must have also been interacting with other Predators and paedophiles. Those people must know a lot more than what is in the Epstein evidence and if they go down they can spill serious evidence on Trump.   These are likely many very powerful and (ironically) credible people with lots of resources to go scorched earth on Trump if he feeds them to the wolves 

Trump is likely trapped in a position where he knows he has to protect all the other Epstein paedophiles for fear of what a few of them could expose about his own involvement. 

It is also highly likely that Trump has extorted many of these people already and many may have been forced to support his campaign.  At least a few of them would be smart enough to have insurance. 

This also correlates to his statement regarding the files and the risk to 'people'. 

This better explains the otherwise irrational actions of Bondi etc. Than simply protecting Trump himself which could be done in a less destructive way.

Lately I’ve been seeing more and more spaces that are race-specific like “Black-only healing spaces,” “Latinx-only events,” or “AAPI-only support groups.” And while I totally get the intention behind it (safe spaces, shared experience, etc.), I can’t help but feel like it’s starting to divide people more than bring us together.

I’m not saying these groups shouldn’t exist. I’m more wondering if they are actually helping in the way we hope? Or are they unintentionally making things feel more separate?

I’ve been in situations where I couldn’t join a convo or event because I wasn’t the “right” ethnicity, and it felt... kinda off? Like I respect the goal, but if we’re talking about inclusion and solidarity, shouldn’t there be more cross-race dialogue together , not in separate rooms?

Also what about people who are mixed race? Or people who feel connected to multiple cultures? Where do they fit in?

To be clear: I’m not trying to downplay anyone’s experiences or say “all lives matter” or anything like that. I just genuinely worry that we’re unintentionally building echo chambers, even within progressive spaces.

There is no reason to prevent baby formula from getting into Gaza. I have seen some people arguing that food is getting stolen by Hamas, but it's less likely to be an issue if the given food is baby formula. This would allow the most vulnerable group, babies, to be fed and radically reduce malnutrition and child mortality. It should be a priority to reduce child mortality.

What might change my view is evidence that there is some significant harm caused by allowing baby food into Gaza, but it currently seems to me that the prime beneficiaries of such baby formula getting in would be children. The harm of allowing baby food in would have to be pretty significant to cancel out the sizeable benefit of reducing malnourishment of children.

1lqsa3r,"CMV: Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy will HURT, not help the economy","Economies perform due to money passing through them.

Is there ANY evidence of this EVER occurring in the USA? Clearly not.

1lul66i,CMV: Donald Trump's presidency is considerably worse for the US then Richard Nixon's ever was,"While both men damaged public trust and democratic norms, Trump’s actions have been more overt, sustained, and systemically dangerous to the integrity of the U.S. & it's institutions. Reasons why Trump is considerably worse for the United States than Nixon ever was:

1. Scale and repetition 

Nixon obstructed justice in the Watergate cover up

Trump has shown a pattern of undermining democratic norms across multiple domains and years, not just one event:
- Pressuring the DOJ to protect allies and target enemies.
- Refusing to release tax returns (breaking modern transparency tradition).
- Firing or retaliating against inspectors general and whistleblowers.
- Using the presidency to enrich his businesses (emoluments concerns).
- Normalizing nepotism and loyalty over competence

Nixon committed a massive coverup and was forced out. Trump’s actions are continuous and ongoing, more public, and go without consequence due to his monopolization of the government and Supreme Court.


 2.January 6th

Nixon lost power due to criminal activity after winning an election.

Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election:
- Spread a disinformation campaign about election fraud
- Tried to pressure state officials to ""find"" votes
- Encouraged fake electors and pressured Pence to block certification
- His rhetoric helped incite the January 6th insurrection, which attempted to stop the peaceful transfer of power

Trump’s actions in 2020–2021 posed a direct threat to American democracy. Nixon abused power to hide wrongdoing. Trump tried to use power to stay in power, even after losing an election.


3. Erosion of truth and spread of disinformation

Nixon lied and covered up crimes, but most Americans believed the media and the system when the truth emerged.

Trump eroded faith in truth itself:
- He branded the press “the enemy of the people”
- Flooded the public with disinformation 
- Popularized the tern “fake news” to dismiss criticism/taint facts
- Promoted conspiracy theories from QAnon to bleach cures for COVID

Trump’s attacks on truth have affected public trust in a more systemic and lasting way than Nixon’s lies ever did.


4. Handling of national crises

Nixon was no hero when it came to Vietnam, but he eventually pulled out and reduced troops.

Trump:
- Downplayed the seriousness of COVID-19, even admitting it privately
- Delayed action, undermined scientists, and spread misinformation
- Mocked masks, discouraged vaccines, and politicized public health

Thousands of avoidable deaths took place because of his + his administration's mismanagement, denial, and politics during a global pandemic.


5. Worsening political polarization and division

Nixon’s presidency created distrust in government

-Trump amplified distrust not just in government, but in democracy, elections, science, education, and journalism
- His rhetoric encouraged political violence.
- He emboldened far right extremism and white nationalism (i.e. ""there were good people on both sides"")
- He fostered us vs them politics with continued attacks on immigrants, Democrats, protestors, & everyone else he disagrees with

6. Impact on public health

To fight poverty, Nixon essentially proposed replacing welfare with a basic income policy for all Americans.

Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"":
- Slashes 186 billion dollars from SNAP and other nutrition programs for low income families 
- Makes significant cuts to Medicaid (12 million+ will lose insurance over the next 10 years) 
- Increases out of pocket costs for seniors on Medicaid


Nixon was a flawed president whose legacy is justifiably stained by scandal. But Trump’s presidency is a more sustained attack on democracy, truth, and accountability, and the damage affects (many) more people. 

These are the reasons why I think Trump is worse; the article I linked provides reasons why Nixon practically looks like a saint in comparison. 

Change my view.

With the rapid development of technology and relatively unease with climate change and social changes, people are scared and uneasy, unable to keep up. 

So, when people are scared, they look for a “strongman” to lead them… maybe for them, being things back in time to when they were more comfortable. this of course leads to a shift towards more far right fascist policies as these “strongmen” they elect play on their fears and direct them towards minority groups or personal things that said leader can use to shift the blame and push certain agendas that benefit said leaders.",Illustrious-Tip8717,444,1131,0.699999988079071,0.205717910994101,1753125814,/r/changemyview/comments/1m5sb72/cmv_there_has_been_a_major_shift_toward_the/,2025,7,changemyview,2025-07-21 19:23:34
1lqveh4,CMV: The Republican Party’s Core Seems to Be Cruelty,"I do genuinely want to change my view because I don’t want to label an entire demographic of people as evil however. 

I’ve been watching the political landscape for a while, and I can’t shake the feeling that the modern Republican Party has leaned hard into policies and rhetoric that prioritize cruelty over compassion. It’s not just about “tough love” or fiscal conservatism anymore, it feels like a deliberate pattern. Here are a few examples that stand out to me:

Healthcare: Pushing to repeal the ACA without a viable replacement, which would strip millions of people of coverage. The focus seems less on improving healthcare and more on dismantling protections for the vulnerable, like those with pre-existing conditions.
  
Immigration: Policies like family separations at the border or slashing refugee admissions feel designed to inflict suffering rather than solve any practical issue. The “zero tolerance” approach doesn’t seem to deter migration as much as it punishes desperate people.

Social Safety Nets: Efforts to cut programs like SNAP or Medicaid often come with rhetoric about “personal responsibility,” but they disproportionately harm the poorest and most marginalized people who are already struggling.

Culture Wars: From attacking trans rights to banning books, the GOP’s culture war battles seem to target already vulnerable groups, amplifying division and fear instead of fostering understanding or unity.

It’s not just policy, look at the rhetoric. The glee some Republican leaders show when “owning the libs” or dismissing marginalized groups’ struggles feels less like principle and more like reveling in others’ pain. Even their economic policies, like tax cuts skewed toward the ultra-wealthy, seem to prioritize the powerful over the struggling.


Am I missing something here? Is there a unifying principle I’m overlooking that ties these policies together in a way that isn’t about cruelty? I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially if you lean Republican and see this differently.

1lqvlqf,CMV: American Midterms will be dangerous for Democratic voters,"I want to start off by saying I'm aware of how hyperbolic this sounds. It's a wild thing to say and something I would have scoffed at in previous elections. I will also recognize that this is speculation at this point, but I would argue that speculation is an informed one based on the trends of history and the statements made by the American government currently. 

But looking at American politics I'm convinced it's not operationally the same country anymore. The weaponization of media and demographics research is bold-faced and alarming. 

This isn't necessarily a comment on whether the midterms will be free and fair elections, though I have my doubts about that as well. This is a strong suspicion I have that, based on the comments and attitudes of the American President and the Republican Party, anyone who votes Democrat during the election will be identified as, in the government's eyes, an enemy. 

The danger may not be in the polling room, it may be what comes after. Already there are calls from prominent government officials to rescind citizenship and confine individuals who disagree with them politically but pose no other threat (see the New York mayoral election as an example). I fully believe these tactics are foreshadowing for an eventual weaponization of voting data and party registrations. 

Please change my mind. I don't want this to be the case.

To me it’s the difference between whom you owe loyalty and trust to. US citizens should be able to trust one another and countrymen and have commonality in that. By committing a crime against your countrymen there’s an element of betrayal that is not there with illegal immigrants. 

It’s the difference between your sibling stealing from you and a stranger stealing from you or one friend killing another rather than 2 strangers.

 Dont get me wrong, many on the left (chomsky or bernie for instance) are very good on this issue but I see many people right here on reddit being snobby about this specific complaint. It comes off as very privileged, and also a form of gas lighting of the working class. It is in fact true that entire cities have become ghost towns because the local factory was shut down and all the jobs were outsourced to sweatshops or other foreign laborers, who are paid very low wages and receive little to no benefits because they are not covered by the labor laws we have here. It is true that there has been an epidemic of deaths of despair in this country for this exact reason, and yet the people who feel most left behind by capitalism are mocked by many who supposedly are on their side.

Who is actually benefitting from this current  setup? Its definitely not the de facto slave laborers, and its definitely not the unemployed, and impoverished american workers. It is primarily in the interest of greedy billionaires, and it is not the hill to die on if you claim to support american workers.

1. Keeps a moral code and enforces beliefs . Well if u need a relgion to scare u into be a morally good person then your a bad person because if you need the feel of hell in the afterlife to need to be good your obviously not good 

2. Creates identity and community for people .

3.gives people less fear for after life . That's just shit. Believing in something that makes no sesne just to make myself not scared of death because ill get 72 virgins or iternal life or a new life etc

1m3rj87,CMV: The complete silence current massacre of Druze in Syria proves for the 1000th time that the world doesn't care about what happens in the region unless the Jews can be blamed for it,"TL:DR - Events in the middle east only get the front page attention in the news if they make Israel look bad



Hey guys,

I myself am not from the region, but have been closely following its news for a while, both from pan Arab, Israeli and global sources.

**A few months ago**, Alawite militias still loyal to the old regime ambushed and killed a convoy of the new government, the result was total mobilization to disarm those groups - the result was that the same government forces did not only target militants, but went into civilian homes and executed entire families, wiping full parts of some villages, the estimates range anywhere between a few hundred deaths to a few thousands, but most of them are around 1500

At the time, in most global media outlets, it was either not reported at all, or reported on the bottom of the page

A few weeks after that, the same government tried to do the same with Druze, initially again, no global media outlet reported about it, despite that it has been the main item on most Israeli (and a minority of Arab) outlets, it was only when Israel decided to start bombing the massacring forces that it was the first time it was reported on the main pages, and the first time I saw it being mentioned on social media (as outrage against Israel trying to conquer Syria, don't get your hopes up that anyone cares about the Druze)

  
**This week**

In the past week, something similar happened again, a local dispute resulting from case where a Bedouin robbed a Druze, escalated to a full total war between the 2 sects - **at that point, no reports on global media**

Then, the government forces entered Suwayda, the region where the Druze live, in the guise of trying to create peace, then, unsurprisingly, did the exact same as they did with the Alawites, massacred civilians on mass, in their cities and their homes

I don't know how many were murdered but judging from the videos, it may be worse than what happened a few months back on the coast - **and still barely anyone other than Israeli media reported about it**

Why is it at that at this point, the only human rights groups that said anything are the Jewish ones (the REALLY Jewish ones, not like [JVP](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/jewish-voice-for-peace-is-neither/) and those clowns, they didn't care as well)?

Then Israel started bombing the convoys of Sunnis coming to Suwayda, and that's where the media started reporting it, and with the title being that Israel bombs Syria, with the massacres at best getting some mention in the middle of the article but sometimes not even mentioned at all

**Other**

Over the last decade Saudi Arabia killed 300k Yemenis (estimation) mostly by starvation, using European money and American weapons - how come is it almost never mentioned in the media?

In the past 2 years 150k Sudanese died in civil war, where is the outrage?

Why is it that when the Jews respond to the biggest massacre of Jews in 80 years, with more measures to limit civilian casualties than anyone has ever applied, it is reported as if it is the worst event that has ever happened and the Jews are literal demons? why is there this absurd double standard when it comes to the Jews?",Dex921,348,987,0.5799999833106995,0.1763073885314449,1752915213,/r/changemyview/comments/1m3rj87/cmv_the_complete_silence_current_massacre_of/,2025,7,changemyview,2025-07-19 08:53:33

I understand that a lot of girls have a problem being outright with sex because we dont wanna be viewed as sluts or easy, so i've been in threesome situations where i know that the girl wants to have sex, but she keeps saying ''Oh i dont know, maybe we should have another shot'' or something like that, which kind of sounds like a ''No, i dont wanna have sex'', but she does want to have sex, she's just making him push more and more, and in another situation where a girl says the same thing, that does mean ''No, i dont wanna have sex'', but the girl won't just communicate her boundary.

  
When i dont wanna have sex, ill just say it outright, if im hanging out with a FWB, and they try a move, ill just tell them like ''Hey, i dont want to have sex tonight'' and that will end the sexual interaction, and more women need to do this, we give way too much agency to the men.

  
Sorry if im not even making my point clear here, i guess i can expand more in the comments but i hope people get my overall point.

“I’m an open misandrist.”

“I feel genuine fatigue listening to men talk.”

“Any woman who engages in heterosexual sex lacks self-respect.”

Reading this, it doesn’t just sound extreme or bitter it sounds like the kind of rhetoric used by hate groups throughout history. I know some will argue that the statistics about male violence or patriarchy make this kind of anger justifiable. But white supremacists say the exact same thing: they point to crime rates or economic disparities to justify their hatred of non-white people. Just because a group has disproportionate power or causes more harm in some areas doesn’t mean it’s okay to use hate-speech and it actively harms their point and probably makes it hard for people to get on board with them. That’s how prejudice works using group statistics to justify bias against individuals.

What makes this more concerning to me is that these subreddits aren’t even primarily about supporting women. They’re not centered on mutual aid, empowerment, or navigating systemic issues. Instead, the bulk of the content seems to be venting about how much they hate men, why men are worthless, or how women who associate with men are traitors or lacking self-respect.

I'm sick of pretending I care about men’s struggles....

These exemplify my point best because you could very easily change this language to be about race and I really doubt that would be allowed. 

It feels similar to how white supremacist groups focus less on helping white people and more on demonizing non-white people. The mindset seems less about empowerment and more about collective resentment.

I’m not denying that women face very real issues in society or that feminism has an important role. But I don’t think the answer is to build communities that normalize misandry. It's ok if you want to never talk to a man again but it's similar to a white person who avoids black people. If the same things were said about women or people of color, they’d be removed immediately and called out for what they are: hate speech.",analtaccount7,230,932,0.5699999928474426,0.1584423263737346,1753515825,/r/changemyview/comments/1m9nj6x/cmv_subreddits_like_rradicalfeminism_and_the/,2025,7,changemyview,2025-07-26 07:43:45
1lytmfs,CMV: True masculinity is advocating for those weaker than you,"

Growing up I was raised by all women and masculinity was something I struggled with. What is manliness? Working with your hands? Shooting guns? Eating steak? Being a stud in the bedroom? Lifting weights and getting swole? Fighting sports such as boxing or UFC? Cars? Being the provider? 

The list goes on and on right?

Now that I've entered my 30's and started a family of my own, I've really began to reflect on lessons handed down to me as a kid 

One of them was ""Boys lookout for family and protect girls, not hurt them""

I always thought this was a little weird but now I'm wondering if maybe it was tapping into something real and raw and amazing.

We as men should never be bully's unless we are speaking truth to power. Like a person with power who is bullying others deserves to be bullied. (DJT and his goons for example)

Men generally are in a position of power of others. People are less likely to start shit with a man versus a woman. 

We are listened to more than women. When our voice is used to advocate for others, it is taken muchmore seriously.

All of this is touching on the privilege of being a man. Obviously being a man has its downsides and there are drawbacks and issues with how society treats men but it is no question that you are dealt a better hand being born a man versus a woman.

So that said, true masculinity is advocating for those weaker than us. Whether it be disabled people. Mentally or physically. LGBTQ people. Women. Children. Animals. Or literally anyone who would have very little power and is being unfairly targeted or bullied.

This is my takeaway from my 30+ years on this planet. This is what it means to be a man. ",Infinite_Kush,1038,479,0.8199999928474426,0.1564305307221932,1752415509,/r/changemyview/comments/1lytmfs/cmv_true_masculinity_is_advocating_for_those/,2025,7,changemyview,2025-07-13 14:05:09
1md88sk,"CMV: the US ""culture war"" is just a billion dollar propaganda machine meant to keep white people terrified, alone, paranoid, depressed.","Over the course of the Vietnam War, white people who had historically been in favor of upholding and defending American institutions became anti-government because their sons kept getting shoved into a meat grinder in southeast Asia by Uncle Sam. There was genuine revolutionary furvor among large swaths of white America, so much so that they started to form local political coalitions with black communities with the explicit intent of destroying the war effort, in spite of many of them supporting Jim Crow just a few years earlier. Nixon made great haste to end the war to remove this pressure, and also hit his base with the classic ""silent majority"" line to bolster their racial fears and anxieties they had *just* started to overcome. This lead to a breaking of the fragile, barely formed ""rainbow coalition"" which stood to undermine the whole system if it had fully coalesced. With white people shoved back into cultural isolation, Nixon acolytes began to build a propaganda machine custom built to keep them scared shitless of their children and their neighbors. Every single ""culture war"" battle since has been these media entities propagandizing white people into kicking up a fuss about this or that, and then attempts to respond to that. Now we live in the natural end result of that: the male loneliness epidemic, high suicide rates among white people, white political paranoia, and a mountain of prescription opioids to ease the pain. Everything a byproduct of the alienation foisted on 5 generations of white people to keep them from truly connecting with their fellow countrymen.

1mjgc2t,CMV: Israel is committing a genocide,"In this post, I will be using the definition of genocide as posed by the UN, as it is the most widely accepted. Additionally, it is not merely a line in the sand, but one that carries significant legal implications. It asserts that genocide consists of ""any of the following acts committed **with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group**, as such:

* Killing members of the group;
* Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
* Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
* Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
* Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

 \[13\] 

It only takes **one** of these to constitute a genocide, but I think Israel's actions can be described by the first four (as was argued in the ICJ). While the genocidal acts themselves are important, far more important (and harder to prove) is the intent with which they are committed. This will be the focus of my post.

I should note that I will be referencing the ICJ hearing on this genocide many times, and each time I will provide a link to the timestamp, as South Africa’s argument was over 3 hours long

The IDF's destruction of Gaza has been so systematic and total that it can only be explained by an intent to destroy, in part, the population of Gaza based on their being Palestinian. The goal is not simply to overthrow Hamas, but to collectively punish all the people in Gaza through bloodshed. 

As of July 30th, the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 60,000 at least. \[1\] That is 3% of the total population of pre-war Gaza, and it is almost certainly an underestimate. An article in the Lancet published January 10th found that this same estimate was underreported by 41% \[2\]. Of the dead, roughly 51% are women, children, or elderly \[1\].  An additional more than 140,000 have been injured. \[1\]

Around 90% of the population of Gaza has been displaced, fleeing for their lives \[1\], but even those who managed to escape to “safe zones” are targets. In fact, Nir Dinar, spokesperson for the IDF, has said publicly that “there are no safe zones.”\[4\] During the ICJ court hearing, which took place just 97 days into the now nearly 2-year-long conflict, it was stated that Israel had dropped 2,000-pound bombs on designated safe zones at least 200 times. \[5\]

The injured increasingly have nowhere to go, as Israel has targeted hospitals and healthcare facilities time and time again. According to Doctors Without Borders, “Currently, no healthcare facility in Gaza is able to handle the large flow of wounded people.” \[12\] On May 22, the WHO had recorded 697 attacks on health care since the conflict had started. They reported that only 19 of an original 36 hospitals remained operational, and that 94% were damaged or destroyed. “The destruction is systematic.” \[11\] 

Healthcare is far from the only essential service the people of Gaza have been deprived of. 96% of households report moderate to severe water insecurity, and 81% have reported poor food consumption. Household might be an inaccurate term, however, because 92% of housing has either been destroyed or damaged. \[1\] 1 in 5 children is acutely malnourished, and that is likely an underestimate. \[15\] This is consistent with the intentions of Yoav Gallant, who called for a “complete siege of Gaza,” because they are fighting “Human animals”.  \[14\] 

After international outrage, Israel has opened up new corridors for aid in Gaza; before then, there were three routes for aid into Gaza’s (original) 2.1 million people. \[18\] Compounding the issue, these shipments are often successfully blocked or destroyed by far-right “activists.” \[17\] The aid that does get through is severely limited by Israeli restrictions. \[19\] This is after Israel blocked all aid into Gaza for 3 months, despite the ongoing humanitarian crisis. \[22\] The journey to this limited aid is also extremely dangerous; from May 27th to August 1st, at least 1,373 people were killed while attempting to receive food. \[20\] Here is an aid truck arriving in Gaza.\[21\] This was within the first 100 days of the conflict.

As argued in the ICJ, these genocidal acts are “rooted in the belief that in fact the enemy is not just the military wing of Hamas or indeed Hamas generally but is embedded in the fabric of Palestinian life in Gaza.” \[7\] Ruthie Blum, former advisor to Netanyahu, has written that “It’s time to dispel the myth that Gaza is filled with innocent civilians.”\[8\] President Isaac Herzog has stated, “This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it's absolutely not true.” \[10\*\] Itamar Ben-Givir, Minister of Security, has stated, “When we say that Hamas should be destroyed, it also means those who celebrate, those who support, and those who hand out candy. They are all terrorists, and they should also be destroyed.” \[16\] If no one is innocent, what is to be done? Nassim Vaturi, deputy speaker of parliament, has called for “erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the Earth.” \[9\] The goal may be to stop Hamas, but in the minds of many Israeli leaders, all Palestinians in Gaza are Hamas.

The genocidal destruction of a group “in part” is established when the part targeted is “significant enough to have an impact on the group as a whole.” \[23\] It is hard to argue that the mass starvation, bombing, and displacement haven’t resulted in the whole of the Palestinian people being deeply affected. October 7th was horrific, but it doesn’t have to be unprovoked to become genocide. In fact, the UN’s definition makes clear that genocide can occur in the context of armed conflict.  \[13\]  What matters is if all people belonging to a group are being targeted, without discretion for their military importance. Were those fleeing to safe zones or traveling to receive aid of military importance? Hamas may be using human shields, but according to Article 51 of the Geneva Convention, the use of human shields does not release the opposing party of their obligation to avoid civilian casualties. \[24\] 

In the past 670 days, the IDF has systematically annihilated all semblance of a Palestinian society in Gaza. They bomb people's homes and the “safe” zones to which they flee. They destroyed hospitals and cut off the aid that the surviving hospitals desperately need. They have starved the people of Gaza and killed them as they clamor for food. They have repaid the mass deaths on October 7th 50 times over, and there is no end in sight. This is all backed up by the genocidal rhetoric of top Israeli officials, who show no signs of stopping. At a point, the mass deaths of civilians aren’t collateral damage; they’re the intention.

But I think we can at least agree that there's some understanding of a form of ""free speech"" that deals with allowing any and all opinions to be expressed and heard everywhere, across the board, no matter how much other people like those, and I think conservatives are very familiar with this interpretation of ""free speech"".

And so, in their own most important space, since they are exercising their abilities to silence other people and shut down conversations they don't like, they should stop acting like censorship is some awful thing and that they are the true proponents and advocates of free speech.

1mfxy10,CMV: Islamophobia has made it impossible to criticize Islam in a normal & non-bigoted way.,"I’m taking specifically about the West. 

Right wingers want all Muslims to die and leftists don’t accept any kind of critique against Islam in general. You tell someone on the right that you’re not a huge fan of Islam’s apostasy laws and they’ll tell you with a straight face that they’re all terrorists. You tell someone on the left that some of Islam’s laws on warfare (like the one about prisoners of war) are morally questionable, and they’ll try to shift the conversation to Christianity, criticism against which they’ll readily accept and talk at great lengths.

Christianity in the West is a great example of a religion we can now criticize in a normal, rational, un-bigoted way in the West. That’s because there’s hardly such a thing called “Christianophobia” in the West, and thank God. In fact I think Christianity is dissected in the West in such a scientific, anthropological way that I think is so fascinating. I think the way everyone regardless of their religious beliefs (or lack thereof, in the majority of cases) felt comfortable tuning in and talking about this year’s Conclave goes to show how normalized rational, non-bigoted discussion and critique of Christianity is in the West. 

Because of Islamophobia, popular discussion about Islam in the West has only ever fallen under two categories: bigotry or blind defense. 

Obviously Islamophobia has caused a surge in irrational hatred and bigotry from the right against Muslims, that we all know, but an unintended consequence of this that people don’t really talk about is how the Western Left seems to have in many ways either blatantly defended the indefensible or become intolerant towards any critiques against Islam to kind of absorb or “balance” all of the hatred coming from the Right.

This leaves very little space for people to interact or engage with Islam in a normal, rational, non-bigoted, non-biased, and non-censored space. I feel like there exists no “centrist” space for a conversation like this, or maybe it’s just that centrists aren’t loud enough about their opinions on Islam as the right and left (I don’t really know if centrists are really loud enough about anything, coming from a leftist). You’re either fully Islamophobic or don’t think Islam’s problems should be discussed whatsoever. 

Like are there normal people who have normal thoughts about Islam? Like there are some pretty good things in there too. Bad stuff as well. Like can we just be normal? Some nasheeds are genuinely so fire. Maybe let’s not advocate for killing Ex-Muslims though. Is it that hard to have a conversation like this?

1mfz11b,CMV: a man is never wrong for seeking a paternity test for a child presumed to be his,"4% of children born in the United States have legal fathers who incorrectly believe the child is theirs biologically. Not men who weren't sure or who suspected the child may not be theirs, but men who were confident that they were.

4% is 1 in 25. I'm in medical school, and I've learned about congenital conditions that are 1.5 in 1000 in prevalence that are considered common. Every single child born in the United States is tested for a number of conditions at birth that are 1 in 10,000+ in frequency. SCID, which is 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 in incidence, is one of them. No one argues that it's irrational or a waste of money to test for exceedingly rare medical conditions, because we correctly recognize that some conditions, no matter how rare, are serious enough to necessitate universal screening.

From the perspective of a man, how serious is misattributed paternity? How massive of a financial and emotional responsibility is it to be the father of a child?

1 in 25 isn't rare at all. It's extremely common. How do I know? Because **Cystic Fibrosis carrier status is also 1 in 25 in prevalence in European populations, and it's considered very common**. 1 in 25 is many of the people you know. It's many of the people who will read this post. It's 300 million people worldwide. The unfortunate truth is that many men misplace their trust because a lot of people are good at pretending to be trustworthy.

Given the prevalence of misattributed paternity, the fact that we consider it rational to test for things that are far less common, and the massive financial and emotional responsibility a man takes on as the father of a child, I think it's perfectly reasonable for a man to test whether or not he is actually the father of a child if he ever feels inclined to do so.",Wooden_Guest_6911,1014,2348,0.6600000262260437,0.5672289173277316,1754162869,/r/changemyview/comments/1mfz11b/cmv_a_man_is_never_wrong_for_seeking_a_paternity/,2025,8,changemyview,2025-08-02 19:27:49
1mzupsm,CMV: Trump is setting the stage to intentionally start a war with Venezuela or Mexico so he can then claim to be a war time president in an attempt to cancel the 2028 elections.,"Trump's moves in relation to Venezuela and/or Mexico are a misguided attempt to imitate Putin and Netanyahu. 

There have been multiple times that Trump and his followers have floated the idea of Trump being President for a third term. He mentioned the idea during a January 2025 Vegas rally ( [https://youtu.be/OXo-XBvMAUQ?t=2465](https://youtu.be/OXo-XBvMAUQ?t=2465) ). Then again during a Feb. 2025 speech ( [https://youtu.be/Vw2AZK5gEok?t=823](https://youtu.be/Vw2AZK5gEok?t=823) ). In March he said that a lot of people have asked him to run again and that, while he's focused on this term he would like to run again and that there are ways around the 22nd amendment ( [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752) ). Even as recently as Aug. 5th he's said he would like to run again ( [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/05/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-president-donald-trump.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/05/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-president-donald-trump.html) timestamp 35:58) There was even been an attempt to amend the constitution as early as Jan. 2025 by Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn. ( [https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/29](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/29) ) to make is so that a candidate can run and be elected for President up to three times. These are all tests to see how much outrage something like this would cause, how much actual support there would be for Trump continuing as President past 2028, and attempts at normalizing the idea of Trump continuing as President past his second term. Add to all this Trump's 'joke' based on the fact that Ukraine has been unable to hold elections since 2019, “So you say, during the war, you can’t have elections,” Trump responded. “Say, three and a half years from now — so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections. I wonder what the fake news would say about that?” ( [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-live-updates-rcna225477/rcrd86684?canonicalCard=true](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-live-updates-rcna225477/rcrd86684?canonicalCard=true) ) and the actions he's been taking to normalize the use of military force on American soil, like the activation of the National Guard and the Marines in California, the federalization of the DC police force, the activation of the National Guard in DC, and the proposal to send the National Guard into other American cities like Chicago and New York. 

These actions combined make the movement of the USS Gravely, the USS Jason Dunham, and the USS Sampson to the coast of Venezuela, along with his authorization to deploy US troops into Mexico ( [https://youtu.be/povVuY6L6pA](https://youtu.be/povVuY6L6pA) ) to ""fight the cartels"", which could spark a war with Mexico if done without the Mexican President's permission, permission that she has already said multiple time she will never give, seem like the first step in sparking a war with one or both countries as 2028 gets closer in an effort to then use that as an excuse to try and stall or cancel the elections.

1mn3jdv,CMV: Republicans do not understand that the democratic base has zero interest in halting the release of the Epstein files to protect democratic leadership or donors who could be in them.,"So this happened: [https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/politics/vance-epstein-democrats](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/politics/vance-epstein-democrats)

Now, let me start by saying that it is plausible to me that democratic party leadership slow rolled the release of the files during the Biden years when they should have pursued the release aggressively. This may well have been to protect high ranking democratic officials.

Frankly, as a progressive, I find this deeply shitty and I have no interest whatsoever in protecting the people who did that. I don't care how many Ds they have next to their names, and I don't care if it means we lose every election from now until the crack of doom. If it turns out the entire party was in on Epstein's child trafficking operations, I want that information public. 

I don't want to be represented by someone who was a part of that vile group of monsters. And I have not encountered a single Democrat (outside of, possibly, party leaders) who want that. There is a certain level of shittiness we democrat leaning voters will put up with in our representatives, I will not debate that, but someone representing us in government after literally enslaving children to be raped repeatedly by the highest bidder? 

Yeah, that's just way, \*way\* too far beyond the pale. 

But it does seem like at least the republican leadership sees our attempts to get the files released as an attempt to root out their people and protect our own. Which allows them to feel morally justified in protecting their own child predators in party leadership.

They do not seem to understand that we are not interested in protecting our leaders. We know revealing this information might remove key members of our coalition and make our party more disorganized and rudderless. We do not care. 

But I get the sense that a lot of republicans \*think\* we care. Possibly because they don't care how evil \*their\* reps are. Perhaps they and would defend their leadership no matter what horrors they covered up, so they assume the democrats would do the same. To me it seems the most likely explanation.

To change my view, please let me know if republicans like Vance don't actually think democrats are unwilling to purge their own. I could see a world where statements like this are designed to get sound bites for their base to hear on Fox News or something and are pure bluster.   
  
You could also provide me with an alternative explanation for accusations like this showing up.    
  
Or, you could let me know if there is a similar divide between republican leadership and their base. Perhaps we are all in the same boat here and kicking everyone out who rapes children is a point of unity in our divided nation. Frankly, I hope that's true.",chaucer345,2629,314,0.949999988079071,0.5051598763555285,1754886346,/r/changemyview/comments/1mn3jdv/cmv_republicans_do_not_understand_that_the/,2025,8,changemyview,2025-08-11 04:25:46
1n1muai,CMV: Citizens United vs FEC (2010) was the worst Supreme Court decision of the 21st century.,"While cases like Dobbs v. Jackson (which overturned Roe v. Wade) or Shelby County v. Holder (which gutted the Voting Rights Act) get more attention, I believe Citizens United was uniquely destructive because it reshaped the foundation of American democracy itself. In that ruling, the Court held that corporations and unions have a First Amendment right to spend unlimited money on “independent” political expenditures. The practical effect was the rise of Super PACs, the explosion of outside spending, and the flood of “dark money” into elections. The change is staggering: in the 2008 election (before Citizens United), outside spending was about $300 million and dark money was under $5 million. 

By the 2020 cycle, outside spending had skyrocketed to over $3 billion, with more than $1 billion coming from dark money groups that don’t even have to disclose their donors. 

On top of that, in 2008 the top 100 donors accounted for about 15% of all federal election funding, but by 2020 they provided nearly 70%. In other words, a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals and organizations now dominate American political financing.

What makes Citizens United especially harmful is that it entrenched inequality in political power in a way that cuts across every other issue. Whether you care about healthcare, climate change, reproductive rights, or foreign policy, money now plays an outsized role in determining which voices are heard and which policies move forward. Unlike Dobbs, which can theoretically be addressed through legislation at the state or federal level, Citizens United rests on a constitutional interpretation of free speech that is extremely hard to reverse, it would likely require either a constitutional amendment or a dramatic shift in Court philosophy. That makes its damage enduring.

In my view, Citizens United didn’t just change one area of law, it rewired the entire American political system to be more plutocratic. Other rulings may have had immediate and painful effects, but this one undermines democracy at its root by giving disproportionate power to wealth. That’s why I think it deserves the title of “worst Supreme Court decision of the 21st century.” CMV.",Foreign_Cable_9530,2070,801,0.949999988079071,0.4903514469720003,1756314440,/r/changemyview/comments/1n1muai/cmv_citizens_united_vs_fec_2010_was_the_worst/,2025,8,changemyview,2025-08-27 17:07:20
1mxwy23,CMV: Islam is beneficial only for Arabs and a loss for non Arabs,"Look at my POV.

Converting to Islam means following Arab culture and leaving your own culture.

That's what happened to non Arabs.

Iranians left Zoroastrian culture.
Turks left Tengrism culture.
Ancestors of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis left Hindu culture.

To follow Islam, they started following many things from Arab culture and started abandoning many things from their own culture.

All muslims around the world have to pray in Arabic, do greetings in Arabic, many of them non Arabs even want to dress in an Arab way to look more muslim.

It means...When a non Arab converts to Islam, the Arabs gain a lot and non Arabs lose a lot.

A cultural gain for Arabs (non Arabs will follow Arab culture), and a cultural loss for non Arabs (they'll leave their own culture because they'll automatically believe Arab culture is superior).

So when a non Arab fights for Islam, he's indirectly fighting for an Arab culture, not for his own.

As a result, the non Arab convert starts looking a lot like a wannabe Arab.

Why don't people realize this?

1mizca4,CMV: Mocking someone's appearance because they’re “a bad person” is still body shaming,"I've noticed that people will mock someone's looks (usually face, weight, and d size) if the person is considered morally bad. But if the same exact person had the same body but was considered a ""good person,"" nobody would say anything. This just shows that people will find any excuse to be cruel once someone is no longer seen as deserving of empathy.

Yeah, call people out for their actions, expose what they've done, but bringing their looks into it doesn't make you better than them. It just reinforces the idea that certain body types or faces are ""wrong,"" even if you only say it when you think someone deserves it

1mf55ku,CMV: The fact that the Berlin Wall existed tells you everything you need to know about communism,"I write this as a person who was born in the Soviet Union in 1980 and who has many blood relations who sang to me its praises throughout my childhood. Moreover, I’m not entirely unsympathetic to the idea of communism and I believe that without the brutal and ruthless determination of Stalin’s regime, the liberal democracies would never have defeated Hitler on their own in World War II.

Having said that, all you have to really know about communism as an system of government is that its leaders were compelled to build a wall to prevent their own citizens from fleeing to lands governed by their political rivals. 

And not just in Berlin either, all communist countries required their people to obtain exit visas in order to visit other countries. What does that tell you?

What’s more thousands of people, many of whom were among the most talented and productive members of communist countries, defected to capitalism, while only a handful of people went the other way.

I am not writing this to excuse the crimes and inequities of market based economies, I am just saying that a system of government which prioritizes the abolition of private property and enterprise cannot exist along side countries where the acquisition of wealth and property is limitless. The latter system will always be more attractive to the most creative and ambitious individuals.

1n037ej,CMV: Dems are less likely to associate with Reps because they don’t view politics as a team sport,"So, one thing I think a lot of us have seen since the election is that several Republican voters are complaining about how their Democratic friends have cut them out of their lives. “Oh, how could you let so many years of friendship go to waste over politics?”, they say. And [research has shown](https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/#:~:text=Importantly%2C%20Republicans%20have%20more%20bipartisan%20friendships%20than%20Democrats%20do.%20A%20majority%20%2853%20percent%29%20of%20Republicans%20say%20they%20have%20at%20least%20some%20friends%20who%20are%20Democrats.%20In%20contrast%2C%20less%20than%20one-third%20%2832%20percent%29%20of%20Democrats%20say%20they%20have%20at%20least%20some%20Republican%20friends.) that Reps are more likely to have Dem friends than vice versa. I think the reason for this has to do with how voters in both parties view politics.

For a lot of Republicans, they view it as a team sport. How many of them say that their main goal is to “trigger the libs?” Hell, Trump based his campaign on seeking revenge and retribution for those who’ve “wronged” him, and his base ate it up. Democrats, meanwhile, are much more likely to recognize that politics is not a game. Sure, they have a team sport mentality too, but it’s not solely based on personal grievances, and is rooted in actual policies.

So, if you’re a legal resident/citizen, but you’re skin is not quite white enough, you could be mistakenly deported, or know somebody who may have been, so it makes perfect sense why you’d want nothing to do with those who elected somebody who was open about his plan for mass deportations. And if you’re on Medicaid or other social programs vital for your survival, you’re well within your right to not want to be friends with somebody who voted for Trump, who [already tried to cut those programs](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/12/18260271/trump-medicaid-social-security-medicare-budget-cuts), so they can’t claim ignorance.

I could give more examples, but I think I’ve made my point. Republicans voters largely think that these are just honest disagreements, while Democratic voters are more likely to realize that these are literally life-or-death situations, and that those who do need to government’s assistance to survive are not w political football. That’s my view, so I look forward to reading the responses.",AlexZedKawa02,1193,1490,0.7699999809265137,0.4545702156868164,1756157159,/r/changemyview/comments/1n037ej/cmv_dems_are_less_likely_to_associate_with_reps/,2025,8,changemyview,2025-08-25 21:25:59
1n17v95,CMV: Neither burning the Koran nor so called 'Islamophobic Speech should be illegal acts in the UK (or any other civilised country),"Let me start by getting a couple of silly caveats out of the way. Obviously, anyone burning a copy of the Koran should only be doing it with a copy that they themselves own. Secondly, it must be under safe and controlled circumstances. 

Dousing a Koran in petrol and throwing into someone's home is an act of Arson, and ought to be prosecuted as such.

However, no matter how offensive any individuals find Koran burning, it should not be illegal. In the last year or so one Koran burner did so, uploading the video to Youtube - with the burner holding some kind of personal connection to a victim of the Manchester Arena bombing (an Islamic extremist terror plot), the other was a Kurdish individual, protesting outside the Turkish embassy. Both of these acts appear to be completely legitimate and reasonable acts of protest.

Now, onto Islamophobic speech. On the one hand, I completely agree that 'being a Muslim' should be a protected class. The implications of this are that if someone fires somebody, refuses to serve someone in a restaurant, or denies someone healthcare, on the basis that the person is Muslim, then this act ought to be prosecuted as being unlawfully prejudiced. However, it is at this line that the specific protections for Islam/Muslim people should be drawn. 

Labour Party UK are supposedly drawing up a definition to allow Islamophobia to be a prosecutable offense. Certain things within their working definition are reasonable, and would apply to any other religion or identity grouping (in effect). For instance, levelling specific threats, harassing, or using slurs against Muslims (or any other individual) would already potentially be covered under laws about harassment and abuse. 

There are however various dangerous ideas within this definition, including things like making links between Islam and terror, discussing the historical spread of Islam via war/invasion (Jihad of the Sword), discussing the link between Islam and grooming gangs, discussing the marriage between Islam's prophet and his child bride.

All of the above are matters of fact, historical record and even appear within Islam's holy texts themselves. How can they be banned or proscribed, as matters of fact?

It is one thing to say that it is illegal to be prejudiced, abuse or hurt to an individual Muslim person, but the idea that nothing hurtful, negative or critical can be said about the institution of Islam itself is patently absurd. 

I suppose much of reddit leans on my side on this, with many atheist and free speech advocates already agreeing with my position anyway, but I do wonder if I have missed something here, and there is a reason that Islam needs this level of protection (or perhaps that it is just the first step towards levelling similar definitions for all religions and identity groups)",8NaanJeremy,1527,953,0.800000011920929,0.4222777716354791,1756269862,/r/changemyview/comments/1n17v95/cmv_neither_burning_the_koran_nor_so_called/,2025,8,changemyview,2025-08-27 04:44:22
1mkeeaa,CMV: Boomer’s have compromised America’s future more than any other generation.,"Not trying to start a flame war, but I’ve been thinking about the long-term direction of the US and how much influence the Boomer generation has had on it. Is it fair to say they’ve done more harm than good to the country’s future?

A few things stand out:

1. Economic policy and inequality
From the late 70s onward, many Boomers in power embraced deregulation, tax cuts for the wealthy, and privatization. These choices helped erode the middle class and concentrate wealth at the top.

2. Housing
Boomers bought homes when prices were low, then used zoning laws and NIMBY attitudes to restrict new development. Now younger generations are stuck with sky-high housing costs and no easy path to ownership.

3. Entitlements and debt
Boomers are collecting the biggest benefits from Social Security and Medicare, but the systems weren’t adequately prepared for long-term sustainability. The financial burden is shifting to younger workers.

4. Environmental inaction
Despite early environmental wins, real action on climate change was delayed or avoided. Short-term economic interests often came first, and now younger generations are facing the consequences.

5. Political gridlock
As Boomers took over leadership, trust in institutions fell and partisanship increased. Congress became less effective, and culture wars took center stage instead of policy solutions.

Of course, not all Boomers are responsible. Many pushed for reform, and plenty are just regular people doing their best. But as a generation, they held a lot of power for a long time. Is it fair to say they’ve left the country in worse shape?

1mlv6wc,CMV: The West Would Have Allowed the Holocaust If Nazi Germany Had Limited Territorial Expansion to Poland and Czechoslovakia,"As much as the international community likes to grandstand as if being anti-genocidal is a ""Western value,"" what they are doing now is precisely what they would have done during the years of the Holocaust. I believe that if Nazi Germany had stopped its territorial expansion (lebensraum) at Poland and Czechoslovakia and focused solely on implementing the Holocaust within those territories, the Western world would have largely stood by and allowed it to happen. My view is based on three key historical factors that demonstrate Western indifference to Jewish persecution and genocide in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

# Argument 1: Genocide Was Not a New Concept, Especially Not for Germany

# Historical Evidence (I hope you see a pattern here)

**Herero and Namaqua Genocide (1904-1908)**

* Perpetrated by German colonial forces in German South-West Africa (now Namibia). Estimated 65,000-100,000 Herero and 10,000 Nama people were killed.

**Greek Genocide (1914-1923)**

* Systematic killing of Greek populations in the Ottoman Empire. Estimated 450,000-750,000 Greek civilians were killed. Occurred alongside the Armenian Genocide

**Various Colonial Genocides**

* The murder of Native Americans during the colonization of North America over centuries. California Indian Wars and massacres (1850s-1870s). Tasmanian Aboriginal genocide (1824-1832).

This short list of examples demonstrates that systematic extermination of ethnic and religious groups was not unprecedented before the Holocaust, yet international intervention remained minimal or nonexistent in most cases.

# Argument 2: Western War Exhaustion and Isolationism After WWI

The impact of World War I created a negative desire in many nations to avoid military conflict at almost any cost.

# American Isolationism:

* **Opposition to War**: During the 1930s, the combination of the Great Depression and the memory of tragic losses in World War I contributed to pushing American public opinion and policy toward isolationism. Isolationists advocated non-involvement in European and Asian conflicts and non-entanglement in international politics.

# French Weakness:

* **Political Instability**: France, in particular, was politically weak in this period, experiencing 16 coalition governments through the 1930s.

# Argument 3: Antisemitism in Western Countries

Antisemitism was at extremely high levels throughout the world during the 1930s and early 1940s

# United States:

* **The Polls**: Antisemitism in the United States was also proven in national public opinion polls taken from the mid nineteen thirties to the late nineteen forties.
* **American Antisemitism**: Father Charles Coughlin, a Catholic radio preacher increasingly attacked ""the Jews"" after 1936... Coughlin's newspaper, Social Justice, reached a circulation of 800,000 at its peak in 1937, and his weekly radio program drew between 5 and 12 million listeners in the late 1930s.
* **Opposition**: Just five percent of Americans in 1938 were in favor of ""allowing German, Austrian, and other political refugees to come into the United States.""

# United Kingdom:

* **Barriers**: A law was enacted in the 1930s to ensure that no more than 5% of the total students in a school were Jewish, limiting the rate at which Jewish children could be admitted to state schools.
* **Refugee Hostility**: The press, which was generally not supportive of refugees, incorrectly reported that there were more Jews in Britain than had been in Germany in the summer of 1938.

# Conclusion

The Western world's has never been anti genocide, it would be more honest to say genocide was more of a western value/tradition more than anything. The entry into WWII was motivated by Nazi territorial aggression threatening their own security interests, not by opposition to the Holocaust itself.

We are only living in the future where the Western world is given praise for helping stop the Nazis because the perfect conditions were met for real action to take place. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened if Japan never attacked Japan or Germany never attacked the Soviet Union. 

Look at America and Europe today; look how easily Nazis became mainstream again. No amount of grandstanding should make anyone forget how long nations stood by knowing everything Germany did, or how much work the everyday people had to put in to get their governments to care.

1mu8d6k,CMV: Trump and MAGA have poisoned the political well and America may never recover,"This isn’t a unique take by any means, but I want to have something to hope for so I hope someone goes for it.

Currently, I see a country with 2 parties: one that relentlessly preserves the status quo of a declining empire, trying to maintain stability at all cost while the cracks are spreading. A party that doesn’t have good answers for many of the systemic issues are country is facing - political corruption, declining infrastructure and education, homelessness and drug use epidemic, and of course widening income inequality where the zoomers (me) are saddled with debt while boomers own $1 million + homes that they’ll sell above asking price. This party, like the rest of the countries politics, are captured by older (age 50+) voters that will not suffer the consequences of the issues and policies enacted today. This party also alway chooses to go high, that inaction is better than bad action, and that now is the time for passivity in the face of radicalism- this is the democrat party of 2025.

Then, there’s the opposition party. Opposition to what? To the status quo. So is it opposition to themselves if they win? No contradiction is possible because it was always the dems fault. It is a united front of negativity - motivated by defeating their opposition, the democrats, by any means possible. There are no values, principles, or truth - as long as you are white, Christian and above all: hate the democrats. It is more important to follow the leader, the president, than it is to hold party members accountable to objective reality. Instead, they have made it a daily ritual through their news networks to propagate fake news because although the news is fake, the feelings that they can instill with it is not. Stripping minorities and vulnerable groups of rights more than makes up for the pain and suffering inflicted on one self. This is the GOP in 2025, they would nuke the country themselves if it owned the libs.

And now we see the GOP in complete control of government, rapidly eroding liberal and independents trust in institutions faster than Fox News & Conservative radio were able to erode republican trust over the last 40 years. It feels like the US is approaching the end of the road, that things are in motion that cannot be undone.

It’s hard to believe that even if Trump disappeared tomorrow, that the damage he has wrought on the US by alienating its allies and causing mass instability won’t be felt for centuries. It is so demoralizing as a young person living now, that the world that we grew up in will be safer and happier than the one we will see for the rest of our lives.

So how do we go back? How do we undo the decades of minding poisoning that conservative media has done, separating rationality from tribal group think that has allowed this Orange buffoon to sell out our country to any and everyone who’ll buy a piece?

1mjiznh,CMV: A Christian “grooming gang” scandal in a Muslim majority nation-state would provoke a far more violent reaction from its public then anywhere in the West.,"To be clear, I don’t think this is a problem for Muslims in the West, broadly speaking. But outside the West: in countries like Indonesia, Egypt, Syria, Nigeria and Iraq the response would be much uglier. Because as much as pick-me leftist academics and progressives like to pretend otherwise, majority Muslim countries are far less tolerant of their religious minorities then anywhere in the West. Now add that to the resentment of colonialism and the stagnation of their countries, mix in the ever-present regulation of muslim women’s bodies and sexuality and we get a powder keg. 

What would be liable to light the fuse on that keg? Oh I don’t know, how about a series of stories on the abduction/rape of Muslim girls by western, white Christian men who assumed all Arab women were hot blooded harlots? 

There would be mass protests in the street, the Egyptian version of Fox News would be ranting about how kafirs are trying to steal their women and turn them Christian, which in turn plays into the victim psychology that plagues much of the Muslim world when it comes to the west. The feeling that secular, non-Arab, un-Islamic ideas are leaching into your society and subverting it intentionally. 

This would lead to violence in my opinion because, when you look at the Arab spring for example, it doesn’t take much for Muslim majorities to go after their minorities. In the Arab Spring case in Egypt, it wasn’t even anything their Christians did that caused the explosion of violent attacks against them. It was simple hatred by radicals who had been waiting for an opportunity to strike. Imagine if they’d been accused of what the men in grooming gangs did. 

I can guarantee no Muslim majority country would have covered it up the way sections of the British government did for fear of being labeled “islamophobic” ",soozerain,1671,445,0.7799999713897705,0.3621213272893115,1754519760,/r/changemyview/comments/1mjiznh/cmv_a_christian_grooming_gang_scandal_in_a_muslim/,2025,8,changemyview,2025-08-06 22:36:00

1n4i4ph,CMV: A Palestinian State will likely be a Failed State,"I don’t want to discuss what the morally correct course of action is or what ought to happen according to international law.  
Within the scope of this CMV I solely want to discuss the likelihood of if a Palestinian State would fail soon after independence were it to be made a State today without systemic reforms.

**Problematic leadership policies** – Abbas’ holocaust revisionism and PA stipends to families of terrorists are problematic policies for alleged moderates  
**Economic and infrastructure fragility** – Gaza depends on foreign aid and Israel for all of their essentials while the West Bank is economically intertwined with Israel and would lose jobs and investments if fully independent   
**Authoritarian and factional politics** – Hamas rules Gaza, the PA rules the West Bank, dissent is suppressed, and past conflicts (2007 Hamas–PA split) show violence is a common political tool   
**Corruption and governance weaknesses** – Both governments are widely accused of kleptocracy and mismanagement, undermining trust and state capacity.   
**Societal and human rights challenges** – Women, LGBT, and minorities face poor protections. Children are often taught hostility toward Israel, and public support for armed struggle remains high

I think that a Palestinian state made today will likely become a failed state soon after independence based off of these above factors unless major reforms are made prior to independence.

You can change my view by explaining how the most likely outcome for a Palestinian state is not to be a failed state. Also acceptable is debunking my raised points and explaining how they are either incorrect or irrelevant to my argument.

1mosc4g,CMV: Congress is the reason our country is a complete shitshow.,"Congress does not have term limits. Members serving terms of 15, 20, 30+ years does not benefit “the people”-it benefits their donors and their pockets. There is no logical reason a member who was elected in the 80’s should have the power to vote on bills, create bills, complete investigations, etc. in 2025. Society didn’t even have flip phones when they were elected, and we’re supposed to “trust” that these members have our best interest at heart? I understand sometimes legislation takes a long time to create and pass, but if it takes 5+ years to create and pass ONE bill, how is that efficient? How is anything the people want going to change? 

Every congressional gathering is a pissing match with streams of power spewing in every damn direction- some stronger than others. Most of the time, at least one member throws a temper tantrum that rivals my 3 year old toddler’s. The members gossip, spread rumors, and shit talk like they’re a professional internet troll on 4Chan. 

Now before you all come at me, yes I am well aware a lot of members don’t fall into that stereotype, but do you really think they’re going to go up against the big bad bullies who act that way? Did you stand up to your middle school bully? Probably not. 

Anyway. 

People always jump and blame the current president (I’m talking about in general, not just DJT) for how poorly everything is in our country, but what about the people behind the curtain? The people who actually CREATE the bills? The people who are supposed to be OUR VOICE? The people who ACTUALLY have the power of our country? 

Change my mind. Convince me that ripping off the curtain and revealing the Great Wizards of Congress for who they really are- selfish, power hungry people- wouldn’t benefit our country in a positive way.

1mfu0yn,"CMV: Islam isn't the ""obvious truth""","In every conversation i've seen among muslims, they say that the truth in islam is obvious and incontestable. They always act like every kafir secretly knows that islam is the truth, but kafirs still deny it so that they can commit forbidden acts like :listening to musical instruments, having a conversation with the opposite gender, wearing gold jewellery and traditional clothes (like cheongsam or sarees), investing in financial products that give interest etc.. this isn't even the full extent of it. 

Islam can be easily disproven:

1. The quran says that earth was made before the stars.
2. The quran describes embryology in a scientifically inaccurate way.
3. The quran says that semen originates in the spine.
4. The quran says that the sun revolves around the earth.
5. Jannat is an everlasting оrgу with 72 virgins for all men, including those who died as kids. What's interesting is that these virgins have regenerating hymens, and skin so pale that you can see their bone marrow. A real god won't make the ultimate reward so hedonistic and pоrnоgrарhic. If you search up the full description of houris, it's an absurdly hilarious list of fetishes. 
6. Quran rejects the science of evolution. You have to watch [this](https://youtu.be/lqk3TKuGNBA?si=gGP2ZQRRKJ-zJweN) 7 minute video before you try to debate this. Evolution isn't a theory, it's an observable fact. Both micro and macro evolution have been repeatedly observed and documented by scientists. Evolution ""by natural selection"", ""by genetic drift"", ""by sexual selection"" are what's labelled __theories__ , as they provide the explanatory framework around the fact of evolution. NASA defines life as ""a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution"". A lot of muslims try to rationalize this by saying that ""i believe in evolution of animals, but not humans"". Honey, humans are also animals. Humans are mammals, and mammals are animals.
7. Mohammed was a PDFile who married a 6 year old. A real god would want his army of believers to protect the innocence of children. Muslims believe that the age of accountability is 15 but the age of marriage can be 6? Excuse me what? 

You need an insane amount of mental gymnastics, blind faith, glorification of suffering, and zero inherent sense of morality to believe in islam. You need to import your morality from a 7th century book, be in denial of science, motivated by the lust for imaginary virgins. This is far from what you can reasonably call ""the objective truth"". This is why apostasy is punished with death in sharia law (according to all 4 sunni maddhabs), because they need to shield themselves from criticism of ex-muslims to avoid their logic from falling apart.

1msci03,CMV: Putting low price limits on death row inmates' last meals defeats the point of offering one.,"So when someone is scheduled to be executed, they're usually given a last meal consisting of whatever they request. Unsurprisingly, this is often things like seafood, steak, or other expensive meals. 

I'm largely talking about the US here (I don't know other countries' death penalty laws/traditions), but several states have imposed restrictions on this last meal, with some states doing away with it completely, and some imposing limits as low as $20-$25. 

Practically, I understand the reason for imposing some restrictions, (such as food that can be purchased locally and reasonable substitutions if the specific food the inmate requested isn't available, or even a significantly higher price limit) but if you're going to offer someone the kindness of a last meal, limiting them to such an incredibly low price means that there's a high chance they won't be able to get what they want. You can barely order a meal from a fast food place that comes to less than $20, much less a real meal. (Especially if you live in a place with sales tax.)

(Full transparency, I don't even necessarily believe in the death penalty to begin with, I just recognize it as a trait of the society we live in, and therefore still have opinions about how it's implemented.)",ChocolateCake16,1243,327,0.9200000166893004,0.2686974257626431,1755389864,/r/changemyview/comments/1msci03/cmv_putting_low_price_limits_on_death_row_inmates/,2025,8,changemyview,2025-08-17 00:17:44
1mpcsa3,CMV: Not liking ghetto/ratchet culture is not the same thing as being racist or classist,"I come from an area of NY that is pretty damn mixed. I have multiple interracial (white/black and white/latino) marriages within my family, and to this day my absolute best friends are a very mixed group. So I don’t wanna hear the I’m racist nonsense meant to shut down a conversation rather than engage in it

I absolutely despise this proud to be ghetto, unashamedly ratchet in public, Idgaf attitude in today’s culture that, unfortunately from what I see, seems to be widespread in black communities. I think it does so much harm to those communities to embrace it and does not help race relations in the slightest


People will say it’s a poverty issue. I’m sorry, I flat out reject that. You don’t need money to act in a respectful manner. You don’t have to be the most educated person to move throughout the world with a sense of modesty and politeness. Rich people can act trashy as well. It’s a culture thing above all else

Whenever I bring this up I just get with “you’re racist”… meanwhile I’m absolutely infatuated and have  tremendous respect for Jim Crow era black America. The fact that they endured so much injustice while remaining godly, intact family units, well educated, and contributed so much to the arts ( fuck yeah blues music), it just makes me sad to see what is happening the last few decades

 I personally blame the media and the glorification of hustle rappers glorifying the lifestyle. That’s who they are shown, that’s the role model image for too many and parents are failing these kids by either taking part in themselves or not doing enough to curb it

1mlsx0d,CMV: Hamas made a mistake in carrying out the 7th Oct attacks and it made the lives of Palestinian people worse,"Hi,
The 7th Oct attacks were terror attacks carried out by Hamas. They were evil from any moral standpoint. I am arguing here that they were a mistake as a “fight back” from a “resistance movement”. If Hamas hadn’t carried out the attacks the lives of the Palestinian people would have been better. I think so because:

1. It gave Israel reason and cover to attack and kill innocent civilians. Many people who otherwise would have condemned Israel were conflicted due to the attacks by Hamas. It made Palestine lose the narrative a bit.

2. It made Hamas a terror organisation. Before the attacks some people, including me, would have classified Hamas as a freedom movement but these horrific attacks solidified their status as a terror group. The way they carried out those inhumane attacks is no way to fight oppression.

3. It gave pro-Israel people a great talking point and something they can always pull of their pocket in arguments. 

4. The parading and celebration of dead people in the streets of Palestine was a really bad look for the people there. It made them looks like monsters.

I am not arguing anything about the attacks so please refrain from using the “how else can oppressed people fight” argument. I am saying that as a way of fighting oppression, this was a really stupid idea and did a lot more harm than good to Palestine.",aloo-ka-paratha,296,1189,0.5899999737739563,0.2497936187659508,1754755145,/r/changemyview/comments/1mlsx0d/cmv_hamas_made_a_mistake_in_carrying_out_the_7th/,2025,8,changemyview,2025-08-09 15:59:05
1mzwbxo,CMV: It is awkward to not know the language of a country you lived in for 4 decades,"Basically, im not trying to insult or hurt anyone but this is genuinely what I feel about my parents and I wished someone could convince me that Im wrong. My mom first came here (a country in the middle east) when she was a teen, and my dad came when he was in his 20's. They were here for 40 consecutive years and they still make the silliest mistakes in the language. I get that Arabic is very hard and Im not expecting them to be fluent, but it is embarrassing how they prefer to talk like how the foreigns talk in here (broken Arabic) even though they can speak better than that, they are just afraid of making mistakes. I try to correct them kindly but they don't like to correct themselves. They like to make others think we dont speak Arabic so that they don't talk to us in an advanced level of Arabic. I speak fluently, and some of my siblings speak fluently. But my older siblings are just like parents, even though they were born here. I don't understand why they are all bad in Arabic. 

  
When I try to teach them indirectly (by talking to them only in Arabic at home), I get tired. Because I have to translate and explain everything. My dad is very interested in improving his English (he is not fluent but trying is good), and I wonder why doesn't he do the same for Arabic. 

  
I understand that learning a whole new language at such age is not easy. If I went to a foreign country now, I wouldn't be able to speak like the locals ever. But the embarrassing part is having the foundation (writing and basic vocabulary and reading) and hearing and reading the language for 40 years and still speaking poorly.

I swear I saw so many foreigns that spoke Arabic much better than my parents and they had known Arabic for less than 2 years.

Their political system is seriously  outdated and flawed. You don't have proportional voting like every other developed country. Voting is skewed by the electoral college and gerrymandering. There's only 2 parties. Representatives are allowed to own stocks. There's probably a lot more I didn't mention. The system is too difficult to reform peacefully.

The population is polarised. And there's concentration of power and wealth.

These flaws were showing themselves 100-200 years ago. The civil war. The gilded age and the great depression. The new deal and ww2 brought temporary relief but they didn't resolve the deeper structural issues.

The day to day life of most people is probably fine. The economy is still going and they have a serious lead in sectors like tech. They will elect another Biden or Obama that's okay but nothing will fundamentally change. The government is not stable anymore.

My contention is that while no single fact or accusation makes it *certain* that he's a pedo, taken together, it becomes unreasonable to say there is a less than 50% chance he is.  That if this was not just any other person, but any other politician, it would be an uncontentious position.

1mlz88o,"CMV: Democrats don’t win because their message is unclear, inconsistent, and overly conciliatory.","Point 1: Their message is unclear. 

I don’t vote Republican, but I understand what they’re trying to sell me. Talking points like “the wall,” “no more pointless wars,” and “lower taxes for the middle class” are spoken on repeat in terms that everyone can understand. Even if these promises are lies, they are completely unambiguous. It’s kind of to his advantage that Donald Trump speaks like a 12 year old because ordinary people are able to understand him. I’ve watched some NYC street interviews about the upcoming mayoral election, and it’s clear that voters are uninformed and don’t have a firm grasp on the issues. 

On the other hand, Democrats talk about a hodgepodge of different issues and seem to highlight the least concrete of them. In the last campaign, the issues that seemed to be discussed the most were abortion and democracy. The end of democracy, though plausible, feels like a distant reality for a lot of people. Abortion isn’t an aspect of life that most people experience every day. They hear about wars in the Middle East, feel the burden of rising prices, and experience the challenges that our broken immigration system has brought every day. 

Point 2: Their message is inconsistent. 

The reason why I think that the message is inscrutable is because of inconsistencies in what the party values. For Republicans, they’ll fall in line eventually, even if they’re not jn 100% agreement with the candidate. For Democrats, every issue is a dealbreaker for somebody. Not pro-Palestine? Stay home. Not pro-universal healthcare? Stay home. Not anti gun? Stay home. And in terms of leadership, we have seen Democrats try to sabotage people like Bernie, AOC, and Mamdami. There a very few issues that can be confidently raised to the forefront because there is so much irreconcilable division within the party. 

Point 3: Their message is overly conciliatory. 

The message becomes unclear because of Democrats’ need to be conciliatory in addressing inconsistencies in opinion. As an example, some voters really care about culture war issues. Some care more about other issues. But to placate those whose dealbreaker is culture war issues, the Democrats either (a) vaguely take stances or (b) don’t take stances at all. In simple terms, they don’t want to offend anyone, so they usually don’t take resolute stances on issues. 

There are a multitude of other reasons why Democrats don’t win, but I think these are the major reasons why voters are not responding.

1n17ywx,CMV: Democrats absolutely should remain open to a female presidential candidate in 2028,"Let’s say an absolutely *garbage* movie is a box office failure. Audience reviews reveal what they were critical about: “horribly written”; “an action movie without action”; “grade-school level special effects”; “The final scene was literally 5 minutes of one guy eating cereal…” 

And the movie directors respond to this bad reception with one conclusion: “Clearly, the movie failed because we hired a black actor as the lead role.” This producer continues with, “It is a shame that the world is still so racist that they cannot just appreciate a good movie for what it is”. And they finish their response with “I have now learned my lesson: *I will never again hire another black actor in my films*. I am here to make money and cannot risk another failure like this one.”

Rather than to *listen* to the audience who shared insightful criticisms, rather than to consider what they themselves could have done differently to improve upon this project, they find a scapegoat to hold as responsible for their mess. Yes, racism indeed exists and surely someone out there is angry about the black man. However, from numerous accounts, this film failed in many different regards that are entirely unrelated to the race of that actor. The director gets a pass from others like them for “being progressive” and “informing” about the racism that black actors face in this industry… whilst simultaneously making a *non-progressive* promise to *exclude* them from future films.

This is a close analogy to what many democrats online are doing now as they declare that they will *""no longer support a female""* democratic candidate for any upcoming presidential elections. These claims that the world is “just not ready for a woman” are based on a sample size of just *two*. Hilary Clinton actually won the popular vote, refuting this claim that “the nation is just not ready”. Kamala Harris was haphazardly thrown into an *already* impossible position for the democrats who had hopelessly anticipated a loss prior to her candidacy. It is an absolute cop out to attribute her loss to her sex. Without question, these two women could have played their cards differently and had better results. Trump (unfortunately) made the right moves in appealing to a struggling nation. He acknowledged that America was faltering and that the people were struggling (whereas Kamala, in an off-putting move, told the people that they were just wrong). And he promised to put Americans first. **Obviously, he was lying**, but he knew this was what they needed to hear. Kamala's chances were not great and she did not use the little time that she had effectively.

We have an early front-runner for the 2028 election in Gavin Newsom. Democrats have claimed, as above, that they refuse to stand behind someone as high risk as a woman. Yet, there are few that could be higher risk than Gavin. This backing suggests that democrats are not truly opposed to taking a risk with the upcoming election. For years, Newsom has been declared a corporate shill, as fake a politician as one can get, a hypocrite during covid, and disliked for not getting things done with an insane amount of CA taxpayer money. He invited and allowed a space for far-right extremists to talk on his show just months before now acting as though he has no tolerance for their BS. Even if he is taking the lead now with redistricting efforts, he has going against him the California wildfires, hoards of drug addicts/mentally unwell camping out all over the streets, theft up to $950 as security/police were not allowed to step in, and a ridiculously high cost of living with outdated, 2bd California homes now selling for $2 million in any of our halfway decent areas. He will never win a nation that has for years said they do not want to be like “Gavin’s California”.

1menkvy,CMV: Liberal puritanism did not cause American conservativism to turn radical,"This view is hard to articulate precisely in a rigorous manner, so have patience.

What do I mean by liberal puritanism? It is behavior by liberals that tries to socially ostracize people for wrong thought or political incorrectness. Now, I do think that some things are extreme and deserve social ostracism (and I try to be charitably lenient while relying like everyone else on a ""I know it when I see it"" test), but this argument reasonably assumes that people accept that liberals tend to go overboard on political correctness.

What do I mean by American conservatism turning extreme? Essentially, everything Trump amplified. The racism, dehumanization of people who are different, anti-intellectualism, the moral nihilism, conspiracy theories. 

I argue thusly, liberal puritanism justifiably cause people to become disillusioned with liberal puritanism, but if American conservatives became radical, then they were forced into becoming this, but chose thusly.


I think it turned extreme because all of the flaws of American conservativism were pre-existing and already present, but turned up to 11 because irs followers willingly chose to give in to their worst natures.

I'll give an example. Liberal woke policing is annoying and I can understand why it makes people opposed political correctness. But if people use wokeness as an excuse to become racist and White nationalist, which I see in enough conservatives to concern me, then it was not wokeness that cause people to become racist. People just chose to be.

Another example: Institutions such as academia and the federal government workforce become dominated liberals may cause conservatives to distrust the claims that come out of those institutions. But a powerful part of the conservative base chose to rather than was forced to turn to conspiracy theories.

1mj4kq1,"CMV: As a society, we are too accepting of obesity","Most people know that being obese is unhealthy, and societal norms do pressure people to aim for a healthy bodyweight, to some extent. But I’m of the opinion that this pressure is misguided, misinterpreted, and unassertive.

* 1) Obesity should be tackled as a global health crisis, rather than a deviation from beauty standards

In 2022, 2.5 billion people (31%) worldwide were classified as overweight, 890 million (11%) of which were Obese. These numbers are increasing at faster rates than ever. By 2035, it is estimated obesity will reach over $4.3tn in annual costs to healthcare, around 3% of the global GDP (World Obesity Federation). Even today, Obesity costs the US around $170 billion annually, and the UK’s tax funded health care system around £6.5 billion annually. These are considerable drains to funding, but what if we look at only human aspects, rather than financial aspects?

* 2) Obesity kills and can never be healthy, no matter how much ‘exercise’ someone does.

Obesity is a MAJOR risk factor for long term diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Being obese puts a stress on your body that cannot be alleviated by working out, or eating salads. Sure, those things would help - but it’s incomparable to the effect of becoming a healthy bodyweight. There are those who push for body positive messages, and say that ‘being skinny doesn’t mean you’re healthy’. That is true, but being obese means you’re DEFINITELY not healthy. You only get one body in this life, so why take a gamble and risk your life?

* 3) The current state of (mainly western) society is sending the wrong messages to people.

We should all encourage self-love, self-confidence, and happiness. All of those things are possible to encourage while also promoting healthy living. We should love our bodies - if we do, surely we should treat it well and try and be around for as long as possible? The message to promote healthy body standards must be done without reference to beauty, but rather the health issues I stated above. People may not want to hear it, but medical education and positive lifestyle changes are far more beneficial to encourage than aimless reassurance that ‘we’re all perfect how we are’. People want to avoid stepping on someone’s toes, and instead give them the short-term gratification of body positive messages. We can, and should, do better.

1mlz2nm,CMV: Most companies could pay their workers higher wages like Costco does but they simply choose not tom,"People often say higher wages aren’t realistic for most businesses and I don’t buy it. Costco proves it's possible. They start people off at a higher wage, give them benefits, and the place still makes money hand over fist. 

People say other businesses can't because they have a different model than Costco does. Okay... and? They are free to change their model, they just choose not to.

Defending other businesses for not paying better wages is a bad argument because those companies are absolutely free to structure their company however they want. 

Note - An argument of ""well they serve a lower income population who can't pay membership benefits"" isn't valid here. The business is *choosing* to serve that population. They're not forced to.

1mg1egx,"CMV: sabrina carpenter is not for the ""girls and the gays"", and her marketing is largely based around men.","okay, hi! the controversy around sabrina carpenter's new album cover inspired me to make this post, and i'll mostly be talking about the sudden switch in her marketing/brand since Nonsense. i'd like to start of by saying that you can argue whether being male centred is good or not, but that's not exactly my point, my point is merely proving that her brand IS male centred, and not for the ""girls and the gays"".

Wikipedia defines the male gaze as the act of depicting women and the world in the visual arts and in literature from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as sexual objects for the pleasure of the heterosexual male viewer.   
  
1. The nonsense outros: all are about men. all of them. all of them are oversexualised. they centre men. it's sexual humour, but all of it centres men. how big he is, et cetera et cetera. moreover, the sexualise outros aren't empowering or subversive either. they're marketable, specifically to the men that she is singing to. it's not empowering because there's less about her sexuality as it is, and more about how her sexuality profits men. which imo makes it obvious that the nonsense outros specifically are male centred. 

  
2. the man's best friend cover (original): while she is the centre of the cover, i'd like to argue that she is the centre of the cover in a voyeuristic way. once again, it's a man's action that is highlighted, i.e, the pulling of her hair. her action, kneeling, is AGAIN in service to the man's action. the title compares her to a dog, direct objectification. how is that not male gazey? 

\-the inside of the vinyl, side A (if i'm not wrong): is once again, her being displayed for a man, she's on a bed, her hands holding the headboard (passive), while a man touches her leg. once again, it's sexualised, but it's not for a woman's pleasure, it's the man who is controlling the situation.



3. Manchild: the only single that's been released off of the album, is once again talking about a man who's problematic, and once again features her centring her life around such problematic men. ""i swear they choose me, i'm not choosing them"" even as a joke, is her being passive. 

  
4. the tracklist for man's best friend: 

1. Tears
2. My Man On Willpower 
3. Sugar Talking
4. We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night
5. Nobody’s Son
6. Never Getting Laid
7. When Did You Get Hot?
8. Go Go Juice
9. Don’t Worry I’ll Make You Worry
10. House Tour
11. Goodbye

and 6 of these titles are very obviously about men, even though they're not released. 

  
5. the short and sweet tracklist: 

1. Taste
2. Please Please Please
3. Good Graces
4. Sharpest Tool
5. Coincidence
6. Bed Chem
7. Espresso
8. Dumb & Poetic
9. Slim Pickins
10. Juno
11. Lie To Girls
12. Don’t Smile

11/12 of these are about men. if we argue espresso isn't about men, that makes it 10/12 songs.

these are all the points i could think off the top of my head. i don't see how someone could look at these examples and then claim that her marketing is for the ""girls and the gays"", just because she had one video where she was depicted as having no outfits for men, and an outfit for the girls and the gays. thank you for reading if you did!

1n3gl1x,CMV: Implying that a man is gay just because he doesn't find some women attractive is homophobia disguised as trolling.,"A ridiculous trend you see on social media: A man says that he doesn't find a certain woman celebrity attractive. Apparently, this triggers many women (and some men) so much that they feel the need to tell him he ""must be gay"". This is condescension and he implication is that gay men aren't 'man enough' to like women. And these kinds of comments often come from otherwise left-leaning 'allies'. 

So to qualify as a straight man, you are supposed to find every woman attractive ? Are straight women attracted to all men ? If not, do they get told ""they must be lesbian"" ? 

This is a combination of toxic feminism, homophobia and sexism that needs to be unpacked. You do not have to feel offended on the behalf of person B just because a random person C doesn't find them attractive. People are allowed to have preferences. Just because you disagree with them, doesn't mean you get to question their sexuality..

1mpjmow,"CMV: The ""recycling is a scam"" narrative is a harmful faux-progressive American myth","There is a very popular narrative in the US nowadays that ""recycling is a scam/myth/fake"", which is promoted by citing that plastic recycling is uneconomical and that companies are actually to blame for waste rather than consumers. This is all only partly-true and lacking important context.    
  
The most obvious problem with this narrative is it usually conflates plastic recycling with recycling as a whole. Even if plastic recycling were entirely not worth doing, recycling of cardboard/paper, glass, and metal are all much more efficient and sustainable. Some of you might argue that most people don't actually conflate the two and are just talking about plastic recycling specifically, but if necessary I can cite many, MANY, hit tweets where people conflate the two. I would go as far as to say that most people who reference this topic make no distinction.

Next, the notion that recycling is not worth doing because most ends up in landfill anyway also has a number of problems with it. One is that it assumes the majority of recycled waste needs to be effectively recycled in order to make the practice of recycling worth doing at all, but the bigger problem is that it's not universally true and instead reflects an Americentric frame of reference that is used to make a broad statement about recycling as a whole without making any effort to discern *why* the \[American\] recycling sorting process is so inefficient. Most other developed countries actually have significantly higher recycling rates than the US. Most other developed countries have multiple different recycling bins for different types of recyclable waste, but this is too much for Americans so they mostly just use single-stream recycling where all the different types are mixed together then sorted later at the recycling plant. This is obviously much less efficient, but what makes it so much worse is that even with the most simplified system possible the average American still can't be bother to put any effort into sorting their waste. Almost any time I see a public trash and recycling bins next to each other I will look inside to see almost no distinction between their contents. The janitor at a school my friend used to work at would just throw all the school's recycling in the dumpster for no reason other than that he was too lazy to keep them separate. Americans who move to foreign countries like Japan often experience culture shock over how much more complicated their personal waste sorting is and how much personal responsibility they are expected to take for it. The uncomfortable truth is this: American recycling being inefficient is not primarily a systemic problem, but a cultural problem tied to American hyper-individualism. When people promote the ""recycling is a scam"" narrative they just make the problem worse by giving people justification to reinforce negligent practices.

Inb4 I know some of you are going to bring up that consumer product companies have promoted recycling in an attempt to shift blame for waste onto consumers, but that does nothing to refute the viability of recycling as a practice. We can regulate corporations while also practicing socially responsible waste management, it's not a binary.",Xiphactinus14,685,262,0.8100000023841858,0.1617534803799626,1755126172,/r/changemyview/comments/1mpjmow/cmv_the_recycling_is_a_scam_narrative_is_a/,2025,8,changemyview,2025-08-13 23:02:52

1mzgu24,"CMV: Western culture is quickly moving away from the things that made it successful and desirable, largely due to a culture of effective self-censorship and social punishment for expressions of observed reality","And the decline isn't driven by politics or formal laws, but the social cost of saying or doing things.

I was not born in a western country. When growing up, I always learned that the success of America in business, economy and research is largely due to their freedom of speech and ability to call things as they are without censorship. We were really jealous of that, and America in particular was seen as a dream place to be. 

Now, how the tides have turned. I think the predominantly experience when meeting Americans is that of frustration in them, and noticing how their private beliefs don't match public speech. We see them self-censor because they fear consequences at work or socially. That mismatch makes society feel ""fake,"" and erodes trust in western institutions and political leadership.

We went from non-westerners idealizing the western culture, to mocking it when seeing Americans punished for words, or institutions bending over backward to appear ""inclusive"". It looks weak, hypocritical, or even comical. Meanwhile, rising powers (China, India, the Middle East etc.) use that perception gap to strengthen their own image of ""realism"" and strength. That's the opposite of what used to happen!

People abroad watch in disbelief as America cancels yet another of its own globally successful citizen for something they privately said, as we see misguided attempts at favoring certain races or genders over others despite the latter being the more promising candidates, or see this enormous gap between what people believe and what they seem to be allowed to say. That creates an enormous incongruence, division, and entirely tears down the political leadership. I suspect a large number of people voted in the personification of their loudest screams they are forced to keep locked down just because he said it out loud, despite the tons of stupid things he also says later, and it being one of the underlying reasons why the US politics is in shambles.

Because the pressure for each individual to stay silent if they don't agree with the predominantly pushed belief system tends to push most further away from actually playing along. We noticed this time and time again in countries that abolished authoritarian leadership. The more you try to silence people, the more they tend to fight back towards the other extreme, rather than a reasonable middle.

In the meantime, that tension and incongruence is what creates the appearance of hypocrisy or ""weakness"" abroad. It's as if the beliefs got louder, but what you are allowed to publicly say is becoming the polar opposite of it. It creates an image of an incongruent, fake culture, destroying the reputation of the west which now appears ""weak"" compared to the other quickly growing nations that learned to be more direct and found strenght to call things as they are - the things that they learned made western cultures great at creating research more grounded in reality, and subsequently superior products in the past. And people able to express themselves freely regardless of their beliefs. As that happened elsewhere, western culture has been moving further away from the values that they correctly identified as correlating with technological, educational, and economic progress.",PastaPandaSimon,295,644,0.5699999928474426,0.1584843187115914,1756095384,/r/changemyview/comments/1mzgu24/cmv_western_culture_is_quickly_moving_away_from/,2025,8,changemyview,2025-08-25 04:16:24

1nkimjq,CMV: Republicans are no longer conservative--they're *fascist*,"We shouldn't be calling American right-wingers conservatives anymore. They've crossed over into fascism at this point.

*Principles of conservatism that MAGA violates*:
- Limited, small government 
(MAGA supports the Trump administration's overuse of executive powers and the military, welcoming expansion of the government into private life)
- Freedom of speech
(MAGA supporters have welcomed Trump's condemnation and attacks against the speech of journalists, media companies, and public figures that have opposing viewpoints)
- Democratic elections
(January 6th was an attempt to prevent the results of a verifiably democratic election from seating the next administration)
- The Constitution
(Trump and his supporters have not only encroached upon the 1st amendment, but outwardly voiced that taking unconstitutional action is justified)
- Law, order, and decency
(MAGA supporters tolerate or support January 6th (for ex., the Trump pardons), minimize right-wing violence, and ignore the crimes and likely crimes of Trump, such as suspected sex crimes--despite claiming Christian values as a foundational value to their cause)


The violations of these conservative principles points toward fascist ideology, where government overreach, suppression of opposition, and anti-democratic values take form. No, we're not living under an early 1940s Nazi regime at this time, but I believe ""conservatives"" should no longer be able to brand that label, as they have beliefs more aligned with fascism.

The left calls everyone fascist! The word has lost its meaning!”

Well maybe the word has lost its meaning because there are so many legitimate racists and fascists in our society that just don’t self identify with those labels despite pursuing similar or exact goals and beliefs. 

If you are “anti antifa” that means you are “anti anti fascist” which makes you a fascist. This isn’t that hard.

1nsyup5,CMV: America will never be able to recover from this even after Trump leaves office.,"First of all, let's have no illusion about it: Trump will not leave office willingly in 2028. He did not in 2020 and he will not in 2028. He has openly said that ""There will be no more elections"" after he is elected; he has repeatedly said that he will be ""a dictator from day one""; he has built a hundred million dollar ballroom in the white house (you don't do that if you plan on not being there to use it in four years); he has turned the entire white house into a gold-plaquered palace like a tinpot middle-eastern dictator's seraglio; he has repeatedly said that American elections are rigged and that he will ""unrig"" it, which means he will likely either rig it or suspend it if he can, so there will be serious issues with the upcoming election in 2026. 

All indications point to that he will, if he can, rule as the first dictator of America for life. 

But hypothetically, let's say miraculously America is able to withstand this onslaught against its own democracy from within, and after 2028, we elect a new president, perhaps Gavin Newsom, and we were to hold a Nuremberg trial against the entire Trump administration, put Trump and his entire crime family in jail; indict, convict, and jail all associates of Donald Trump, all the people who enabled the power grab for Donald Trump, raze all the Trump towers to the ground, like what allied armies did to the defeated Nazi Germany, completely reverse course on all authoritarian policies that Trump has enacted, re-establish political guard rails, introduce new legislation to prevent the rise of another Trump for the next 250 years. 

Even then, in this most optimistic outcome, which is unlikely to be honest, I don't think it's possible that the rest of the world will ever trust America again. Think of Germany. Germany was the center of the world prior to World War II. Germany dominated the world in terms of science, technology, arts, philosophy, music, literature. Nazi Germany completely destroyed this once great civilization and to this day, nearly 80 years afterward, Germany has never been able to recover to reclaim its prestigious position in the world it once held, and to this day, Germans live in shame over what happened 80 years ago.

What is happening to America under the Trump administration is very similar. For over 80 years, America has prized itself as the champion of democracy, freedom, equality, rule of law; fighting against tyranny, slavery, oppression around the world; and yet America, under the current Trump administration, is turning its back on all those values. And America is now attacking its own most staunchest allies, from Canada, to Great Britain, to Japan and South Korea. It took America over 80 years to build this trust internationally, and maintaining that trust has been costly and laborious. Once broken, it can never be recovered.

There is an American expression: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me, or, as American president George Bush so eloquently put it, ""shame ... shame ... shame on  ... fool me you can't get fooled again."" The rest of the world was fooled for the first time by the election of Trump in 2016. Now, again, in 2020. And this time, it has been much worse. The rest of the world will forever remember America as the country that is capable of electing a dictator-wannabe, not once, but twice. 

The rest of the world will think twice, even if America were to reverse course, before trusting ever America again. And that trust is not just as in terms of political and military alliances, but also entails the trust in the American bond, the U.S. treasury. the dollar as the reserve currency of the world, the global presence of American military, which were allegedly to protect the free world from authoritarianism, which America itself is now flirting with. 

I'm very pessimistic about the future of America; as someone who loved America, it actually brings a tear to my eyes to see the greatest experiment in the world to come to a screeching end. It actually saddens me profoundly to think of so many people living under dictatorships in other countries who once made the statue of liberty with papers and straws, who openly protested and championed for freedom and democracy, under the threat of torture, imprisonment, and death. 

That kind of admiration for America in other countries, during the heyday of cold war, most likely will be gone forever.

1nnjy9t,"CMV: It is perfectly reasonable to call MAGA Nazis, Fascists, Authoritarians, ect. in common parlance because the distinctions between those terms are technical quibbles and MAGA are right in the middle of the Tyranical Venn Diagram.","So this has come up recently in more than a few places: [https://mndaily.com/204755/opinion/opeditorialschneider-5ba7f7a796c60/](https://mndaily.com/204755/opinion/opeditorialschneider-5ba7f7a796c60/)

Now, like it or not, the ""Nazis"" label is currently being used as a general term for authoritarianism. You could argue that anything that is not Hitler's party circa the 1930s and 40s doesn't count as Nazism. Fair enough.   
  
But people drawing that distinction remind me a lot of people who draw a distinction between pedophiles who rape children before or after puberty. They are technically correct that there is a difference. But if you have to draw that distinction the people you are talking about are already morally in the sewer.  
  
This common parlance usage has been going on for some time. Over 20 years ago in 2003, Lawrence Britt wrote this list of early warning signs of ""Fascism"":

1. Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism
2. Disdain for the importance of human rights
3. Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause
4. The supremacy of the military/avid militarism
5. Rampant sexism
6. A controlled mass media
7. Obsession with national security
8. Religion and ruling elite tied together
9. Power of corporations protected
10. Power of labor suppressed or eliminated
11. Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts
12. Obsession with crime and punishment
13. Rampant cronyism and corruption
14. Fraudulent elections

How accurate are all these to historical Fascism? I've read lots of differing arguments about it. But they are all pretty close and also clearly things Trump and his ilk are currently doing.   
  
They are also things his supporters will try and claim he isn't doing by twisting things into the most unreasonable definitions and sub categories possible. You've all heard these arguments: his fake electors scheme doesn't count as ""a fraudulent election"" because it didn't technically work; he doesn't \*control\* the media, he just threatens them with federal lawsuits and having their broadcast licenses revoked when they say something he doesn't like. That's not the same.

Can you construct an argument against all of these things that defines MAGA's actions as slightly different categorically? Technically yes.   
  
Does the fact that you had to come up with specific narrow arguments to technically separate him from all of this very slightly tell you how close he is to all of these things? Also yes. 

Basically, you can try to hair split your way out of it, but MAGA's clearly doing really, \*really\* bad things and is probably planning worse. We have seen a lot of people do a lot of extremely similar, if not identical, things in the past and using those past movements as shorthand is not uncalled for.  
  
We can sort out MAGA's phylogeny after their reign of terror has stopped. 

CMV by telling me why using the historical terms for the current evil distracts us from stopping the current evil.

1nsv0wd,"CMV: The rise of ICE is proof that after the past 50 years, conservatives / Republicans have always wanted a police state.","The litany of abuses by ICE just in the past few months, from not granting people basic Constitutional rights, to ignoring legal documents long enough to whisk people away to undisclosed locations, is a long line of consistent pro-police state behavior from conservatives / Republicans over past 50 years. 

In 1971, Richard Nixon started the first Drug War policies, along with the creation of the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration), where it was flat out admitted by high level people that it was to disrupt African American and anti-war communities. 

In the 80's, Ronald Reagan single-handedly invented the modern prison-industrial complex with his Drug War policies, where the inmate population ballooned to the millions (Bill Clinton also went further with his crime bills) , along with Iran-Contra, where he was deliberately setting up minority communities to fail. One of the biggest aspects was the militarization of the police force, and new crimes being added, many carrying long sentences. 

On Ronald Reagan, he passed the first major gun control policies to combat the Black Panthers during the Civil Rights Movement, showing that even then he didn't care about individual rights

Post 9/11, Republicans passed the Patriot Act, which enabled the open creation of a surveillance state (admittedly Obama also pushed that much further with his own policies).

Circle to the past 10 years where it's proven that marijuana isn't dangerous, numerous states have legalized it, but the people preventing marijuana from being legal are Republican states, and conservatives in Congress. Both of which are influenced by private prison lobbies.

Now the last couple of months has seen ICE swell in its power, with Trump and his supporters (both voters and legislators) encouraging its actions, regardless of the constitutionality of their actions. 

It's proven that Republican/conservatives have always preferred granting law enforcement agencies increased power to handle their specific cause.

1nmgabe,CMV: The anger people on the left have is aimed at right wing politicians and government officials. The anger people have on the right is aimed at regular left leaning people.,"When I hear people on the left complaining about the state of the country, it’s always aimed up. It’s aimed at Trump, it’s aimed at Republican senators and governors and house reps. It’s aimed at right wing billionaires. You’ll occasionally see left wing people ripping on rednecks and “the guy from their high school posting right wing memes on Facebook”, but that never comes off as anger, it comes off like they’re making fun of them. 

Right wing people’s anger doesn’t go up, it goes across. It’s at their friend who stopped talking to them because they disagreed with their views on Covid. It’s at the teachers “indoctrinating” their kids. It’s at the regular people gleefully celebrating the murder of a person because they held similar views to them. Again, you’ll see right wing people ripping on Biden or Pelosi or AOC, but it comes off more like they’re making fun of them, and less angry than the contempt they have for their left wing peers. 

I understand both angers. Obviously I understand hating Trump and the old men running the country who refuse to leave. But I also understand the contempt right wing people have for regular left wing people due to how they’ve treated them for years. 

The reason I bring this up is because it seems like the hatred the right has for the left is more fundamental and more lasting. It doesn’t matter who the left runs in 2028, because that’s not what they’re mad at. They’re mad at all the regular left leaning people who belittled them for years, and a good left wing candidate won’t win any of them over. 

Obviously this is all extremely subjective, but if anybody has a different take I’m definitely willing to change my view. 

EDIT: to be more succinct, most of the anger left wing people have stems from how Trump made them feel. Most of the anger right wing people have stems from how the left wing people in their lives have made them feel.

1nsqpit,CMV: Western anti-immigration rhetoric is deeply hypocritical and ignores the global system they created.,"      I’m young, I’m Tanzanian, and I know I don’t have all the answers. But from where I stand, the way immigration is framed in the West feels not only unfair, but hypocritical to the point of cruelty.

Here’s why:

•	You kept us underdeveloped on purpose. For decades, Europe and the US blocked African countries from industrializing. Britain and France actively resisted West African attempts to build chocolate factories or oil refineries because you wanted the raw materials cheap. France still runs Françafrique, keeping entire economies on a leash. Then you turn around and sneer at “economic migrants” like it’s our personal failure.
	•	Visas are cages. I visited the EU this summer. It took 4 months of humiliating paperwork and €350 just to stay 10 days. Meanwhile, Westerners flash their passports and stroll into our countries without question—often to exploit cheap labor, beaches, and women. The inequality is baked into your passports.
	•	History’s double standard. Europeans once scattered across the globe like locusts—colonizing, stealing land, enforcing religion, enslaving, extracting wealth because Europe was a mess and you wanted out. But now, when Africans seek the tiniest fraction of that mobility, suddenly it’s “protect our borders.” You enriched yourselves by invading the world, but we’re “parasites” for legally applying for visas?
	•	Integration doesn’t matter. We study, we work, we learn your languages, we try to fit in. But to you, I’m still just a “dangerous Black Muslim African” before I even open my mouth. You don’t see humans, you see caricatures.
	•	And then there’s the sickest hypocrisy. Western “passport bros” come to our countries, use their wealth and privilege to exploit women, film it for clout, and brag about “easy wives.” That’s somehow tolerated, even celebrated in some corners. But when Africans seek opportunity in your countries—through work, study, or marriage—we’re portrayed as predators? How’s that not the ultimate double standard?

So yes, I’m angry. Because the West stole the world, broke it, hoarded the wealth, and now demonizes anyone who dares to cross the fences you built.

I also deeply hurt by the rhetoric that right wingers are using to describe people like me. I’ve lived in Tanzania all my life, all my friends and family are Tanzanian. We might not have much but we’re good people but in the eyes of western right wingers, we’re savages who have savage cultures and are not suited for civilised society. It’s dehumanising and heartbreaking. I love learning about the western world and its history and culture but it’s sad how your people portray mine.

1nuq3od,"CMV: Sharia law is incompatible with a secular, non-Islamic society","For those that don’t know, secular means attitudes activities or other related things that have no religious or spiritual basis. Most of the “West” — meaning places like the UK, France and the US — are considered secular in spite of the fact many of their moral precepts are based on Christian theology/ethics. It doesn’t mean you can’t be devout believers in whatever faith you profess, it just means faith becomes a private, individual matter instead of a public, collective one. 

Sharia is incompatible with that. Most Muslims want/believe in some form of institutionalized religious law that caters to their faith. Which isn’t itself problematic in a a religiously homogenous society but in one where you need to separate church from state or one where there’s more then *one faith* it becomes an issue. Especially for religions like Judaism and Christianity which had to undergo the sometimes painful, fraught process of secularization and now watch Muslims get treated with a double standard. 

In France for example there’s growing evidence that older and younger French born Muslims all support Sharia law over French law and would like to see it instituted. But once you give an inch there’s no going back. It becomes a right they’re now entitled to and they’ll fight for more.

1ndracw,cmv: gun control laws would not have prevented Charlie Kirk's death,"So I think a point I disagree with is people associating Charlie's 2nd amendment stance with his unfortunate passing. I think this confuses types of weapons and types of shootings.

The arguments for gun control are typically associated with mass shootings. We all know the story. Someone gets an AR-15, or some type of gun with high magazine capacity, to end as many lives as possible. The indiscriminate harm in theory can be reduced by restricting certain types of guns. This does make sense. Slower fire guns or guns with smaller magazines reduce the time period to cause indiscriminate harm.

However, Charlie's situation is very different:

* A single shot was fired.
* No one else was targeted at the shooting.
* The weapon used is a long range gun with a slow rate of fire and very small magazine capacity. 
* This type of shot requires training and accuracy, likely acquired through a legal form of training or permits. (Note: not confirmed, but my judgement)

It would be very hard to have gun control laws prevent this because:

* It would require banning nearly all guns, which is far more difficult than what gun control advocates call for.
* Assassinations can be carried out with many types of weapons, when the focus is a single person. The light rail murder is an example. 

To change my view, you can present ideas or evidence of how a gun control law could have prevented this incident.",Healthy_Shine_8587,608,1531,0.6499999761581421,0.2758738476252133,1757540846,/r/changemyview/comments/1ndracw/cmv_gun_control_laws_would_not_have_prevented/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-10 21:47:26

1nc0kj1,CMV: Family courts are not “anti-men”. Custody is usually about caregiving history,"The men’s rights argument is that courts favour women. 

But in most cases, custody goes to mothers because they have been the primary caregiver before separation. 

Courts try to minimise disruption to the child’s life, not punish fathers. When fathers are equally involved, studies show their chances of shared or primary custody are far higher than MRAs suggest.

Why should courts ignore caregiving history and force equal custody when the child’s best interest is stability?

Also, child support isn’t a “penalty” against men. 

It’s about covering the child’s expenses in line with each parent’s income. 

Since men, on average, earn more than women, they more often become the payers. That’s not gender bias, it’s math. If mothers earned more and fathers got custody, the roles would reverse.

1njbwny,CMV: The front page of Reddit has been radicalized to the point of no return.,"I've been on reddit for over 12 years now, and can say with absolute certainty, that the standard front page posts and comments (news, politics, pics, etc) have been co-opted by bad actors and bots which has created more discourse and radicalization which is not a benefit to society. There was a time when nuance could be explored, but that time is long gone by the downvote brigade. Now, reddit exists only in extreme black and white scenarios with finger pointing and whataboutism being the main source of discussion.

I believe that this shift is all by design predating the decision for reddit to go public as a company. To my memory, the shift naturally started during Trump's first term as president. Trump might possibly be the greatest thing to ever happen to Reddit in terms of shareholder profitability. He sowed division both in the nation and online. This created far greater engagement on reddit due to its left leaning user base. People love to hate, and people love to come together to hate. It's good for business. 

Now, every front page thread feels as if it has been *manufactured* to create more discourse. Articles are posted constantly with misinformation, disinformation, or just half-ass stories that have not yet been verified. The comments are all the same. Literally, it's as if there's a playbook of starter comments for all of these posts. 

I have great concerns over the growing bot problem on reddit. The opinions of the masses are being swayed because of high visibility from the same (few) upvoted comments. Many usernames are very obviously generated with the same formula of name_name#. Take a look at these profiles and they're marked as ""NSFW"" for some reason without any scandalous posts or comments.

Trump has played into the southern strategy perfectly, which has only amplified it, with his strong white nationalist agenda. Republicans who now try to claim they are moderate are unable to separate themselves from white supremacists because they are supporting division and racial inequity by continuing to vote red. No other Republican President in contemporary American history has leaned into the Southern Strategy as heavily as Trump since Reagan. And it has worked effectively for him.

With how much more vitriolic his second term has been (and with how his party had enabled him more and now he essentially has a private police force with a higher budget than most country’s militaries) I see no reality in which he will leave office in 2028.

Truthfully, I don’t even see how he’d be physically forced out this time because, again, of his private army of ICE.

1nmvil3,CMV: Anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic and should not automatically be conflated with antisemitism,"*Definitions:*

Zionism = support for the existence of a Jewish state in Palestine/Israel.

Anti-Zionism = opposition to that political project.

Antisemitism = hostility, prejudice or discrimination directed at Jews as a people.

*In its most basic form, my argument is as follows:*

P1. A substantial share of global Zionist support comes from non-Jews.

P2. Many Jewish Zionists approach Zionism as a secular, cultural, or political project rather than a religious doctrine.

P3. Some Jews oppose Zionism on explicitly religious or ethical grounds.

C. Therefore, anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic and should not automatically be conflated with hostility toward Jews.

*The evidence in support of P1, P2, and P3 is as follows:*

P1:

Zionism, though emerging from Jewish history and identity, has long drawn enthusiastic supporters well beyond the Jewish community. In the United States, Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia, tens of millions of evangelical Christians embrace Christian Zionism, regarding the modern State of Israel as central to biblical prophecy or as a strategic ally. These constituencies lobby governments, fund settlement projects, and organise pilgrimages, making non-Jewish Zionists one of the largest and most politically influential pro-Israel blocs worldwide.

This breadth of support shows that Zionism is not exclusively a Jewish ideology and that backing the existence of a Jewish state is not synonymous with being Jewish.

P2:

Within the Jewish world, a large proportion of Zionists identify as secular or cultural rather than religious. The founders of modern political Zionism (Theodor Herzl, Max Nordau, Ahad Ha-Am, David Ben-Gurion) were themselves non-observant and motivated by nationalism, cultural revival, and political security. Contemporary data reinforce this pattern: surveys of Israeli Jews and the wider diaspora (e.g. Pew Research Center, Jewish People Policy Institute) consistently show that many who call themselves Zionist describe their Jewishness in cultural or ethnic terms and place little or no emphasis on religious observance.

This demonstrates that even among Jews, Zionism is primarily a political-national movement rather than a theological mandate.

P3:

Jewish opposition to Zionism is likewise well documented. Ultra-Orthodox groups such as Neturei Karta and the Satmar Hasidim reject the creation of a secular Jewish state as a violation of divine will, arguing that Jewish sovereignty must await the Messiah.  Other Jews, religious and secular alike, criticise Zionism or particular Israeli policies on ethical or humanitarian grounds, citing principles of justice and universal human rights. Their critiques are grounded in conscience, not hostility toward their own people.

This internal diversity shows that principled anti-Zionism exists within Judaism itself.

*Conclusion:*

Taken together, these premises provide a coherent basis for distinguishing anti-Zionism from antisemitism. The large non-Jewish Zionist constituency, the predominantly secular character of much Jewish Zionism, and the presence of Jewish critics acting from religious or ethical conviction all demonstrate that opposition to Zionism is a political or moral stance, not evidence of hatred toward Jews. This does not deny that antisemitic rhetoric sometimes appears within anti-Zionist movements, but it shows that anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic and should not automatically be conflated with hostility toward Jews.

Therefore, anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic and should not automatically be conflated with antisemitism.",SummumOpus,540,1150,0.6499999761581421,0.2113918125966285,1758469875,/r/changemyview/comments/1nmvil3/cmv_antizionism_is_not_inherently_antisemitic_and/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-21 15:51:15
1n8dugg,CMV: The European liberal aversion to immigration control and reform will end in disaster,"This arguement is not about exactly what immigration policy should look like but a view that most of Europe are on the wrong track and will hand power to far right parties in the next decade by not alligning themselves with voters. 

This post was inspired by an [astounding story](https://unherd.com/newsroom/cologne-immigration-pact-opens-door-for-afd/) out of German local elections. All parties other then the AFD have agreed not to talk about some of the negative consequences of immigration.

I know I'm more right wing then most of reddit but I find the AFD abhorrent and I see this as a colosal mistake, this will only drive more voters into their arms.

We have seen this already in the UK to a certain extent, neither mainstream party were willing to meet voters where they are on this issue and current polling has Reform on track for a landslide.

I think we will only see this issue more and more over the next 10 years, unless centrist parties and centre right parties are willing to move to the right on this issue.

1na6kzw,CMV: I believe access to abortion should be legal and unrestricted up to viability.,"I believe that individuals should have the legal right to access abortion without significant legal or logistical barriers, at least up until fetal viability (around 23–24 weeks). To me, bodily autonomy is a foundational principle of a free society, and I don't think the government should have the power to force someone to remain pregnant against their will.

I also believe that restricting access to abortion disproportionately affects people in poverty, people of color, and those in rural areas, making it an issue of social justice as well as personal liberty.

I understand that others view the fetus as a life with rights, and I do think the moral complexity increases later in pregnancy, especially after viability. But prior to that, I believe the pregnant person's rights should take clear precedence.

I’m open to having my mind changed, especially if someone can show a compelling argument for fetal rights overriding bodily autonomy before viability, or if there's a strong ethical or societal reason to impose earlier restrictions.",Lost-Quantity7096,257,1103,0.6499999761581421,0.1896875086486904,1757182453,/r/changemyview/comments/1na6kzw/cmv_i_believe_access_to_abortion_should_be_legal/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-06 18:14:13

1nik218,cmv: The Epstein files are definitive proof that it was never about “political differences.”,"The fact that virtually every congress votes is along party lines is always characterized as the US being “hyper partisan” - that the differences in politics between the parties are simply too far apart to find common ground. For whatever difference it makes, I am roughly even in my skepticism of both parties. I am NOT a centrist, I am not “seeing both sides” or taking a middle position between them. But I’ve never been a Democrat and I couldn’t give a shit if they’re considered “good guys” or not. 

But the Epstein files prove, without a doubt, that Republicans are nothing but corrupt enablers. If this were about politics, Epstein would stand for everything Republicans hate. They favor law and order, crime and punishment, they consider pedophiles and sex traffickers the absolute worst kind of people, they claim to seek transparency and letting people “form their own opinions.” 

In fact, when Biden was president and Democrats were in charge of Homeland Security, Democrats weren’t saying anything about Epstein. It was Republicans who were using his case as a rallying cry and a demand for accountability. 

But when it became apparent that the files were critical of Trump, Republicans abandoned EVERYTHING they stand for and rallied behind protecting their party leader. There is nothing Republicans can say about anything that shouldn’t be viewed with the knowledge that they do not give a shit about anything except their leader staying in power.

1nisp78,CMV: Most American's have ZERO Concept of Left of Center Politics,"I genuinely believe that people have no idea the nuances of the Left leaning political ""labels"", and this causes them to attribute the most extreme political stances on ""lefties"", who ironically don't actually subscribe to said stances. This also has the side effect, of making the left seem chaotic and ""less principled"" when in actuality each ""subset"" of the left is pretty defined and consistent.

|Extreme Left|Radical Left|Strong Left|Left|Center Left|Center|

|N/A|THE DSA|Bernie Sanders|\*Elizabeth Warren|\*Obama|\*Bill Clinton|
|Revolutionary|Fundamental Change|Targeted Reforms|Stronger ""Guardrails""|Incremental Left|Republican Lite|

*Note: in the global Political Overton window, Social Democrat would be the CENTER. Only in America, is a Social Democrat considered left leaning.*

\* >!Bill Clinton was left of Reagan, but he was not left in the modern scope of the democratic party. His administration pushed the party to the right. He softened many of Reagans policies but did not reverse/dismantle them (ex. Reagan took top marginal tax from 70% to 28%, while Clinton took it back to 39%). Triangulation was a fancy word for doing what was advantages politically, as the democrats were desperate for relevance in a 12 year executive branch drought (the longest in the modern era).!<

\* >!Some folks may argue that Obama is a strong lefty, but that isn't really true in his policies. Even a lot of his deficits were because of rebuilding the economy. He was left-ish on social issues, but largely response/defensive when it came to the economy.!<

# Conflation

Neo-Libs are market/corporate driven, and are willing to lean left if it is politically advantageous. They are the leading cause of American's confusion regarding the left. There is an argument to be made that the democratic elite are still Neo-Libs. The leadership of the Democratic party like Chuck Shurmur and Nancy Pelosi are barely approaching Obama left. They started their political career during Reagan's, Bush Sr., or Clinton's administrations. Democratic elites actively oppose the folks to the left of them. So when you say CNN is the propaganda arm of the democrats, then the correct appraisal is that CNN is AT BEST center left.

On the actual Left spectrum, there is Bernie sanders and progressives who don't even hold many of the positions that people attribute to them, while also being conflated against the likes of Nancy Pelosi. The democratic elites' failures and insincerity get attributed to folks like Sanders. The fact that Obama's economic mishaps are used as critiques of progressive policies is eye-opening. 

This is where it gets confusing, Bernie is to the right of the actual American socialist. The Democratic Socialist of America (The DSA) aims to use democracy to nationalize many institutions. Like air travel being government ran instead of market driven. Bernie Sanders really only wants Progressive taxes and Medicare for All. Barely talks about much else. Is this radical left? 

Speaking of,

America has also semantically misconstrued Extreme and Radical. Radical is now synonymous with violence, when it was originally a measure of scale. Extreme is the violent and potentially revolutionary political lean. America has some radical figure heads. The left has none who are prominent. You can't even name them and if you could I don't think the average American can. Those radicals 100% do not have the ear of the democratic elite or the corporate oligarchy. What Policy are these folks shaping and where are the signs?

I guess the CMV is if you can change my mind, that the American people DO understand the nuance of the left. Or if misattribution of stances is somehow justified. Ironically this misattribution of political ideas is largely why the right is irate of the left. Is social issues alone significant enough to define someones politics?

1n8dp5x,CMV: Digital piracy is not inherently wrong in a world where “buying” media doesn’t mean ownership,"We live in a licensing economy. When you “buy” a movie on Amazon, or a game on Steam, or an eBook on Kindle, you aren’t really purchasing it in the traditional sense, you’re buying the right to access it, under terms that can be revoked at any time. Companies can and do pull purchased titles, lock them behind DRM (Digital Rights Management), or outright delete them from your account.

So if buying isn’t ownership, why should piracy be treated as theft? Theft implies taking something away from someone else, but piracy doesn’t deprive the rights holder of their copy. At worst, it bypasses a license. At best, it restores consumer autonomy that greedy corporations have systematically stripped away.

If we accept that:

1. You don’t truly own what you “buy,”

2. Corporations have effectively rented culture back to us with strings attached,

3. And piracy provides the same (or better) access without pretending at ownership—


then digital piracy seems more like leveling the playing field than stealing. It’s a form of consumer resistance against artificially restricted access to our own culture.

1nqpr1y,CMV: The Epstein List is the real distraction.,"I am incredibly exhausted with people who are ostensibly on my side who believe that the death, destruction, economic instability, ethnic purges, democratic backsliding, and general corruption of the Trump administration are all just a distraction from the really important thing: who’s on The List. The reality is that it is the other way around.

If the Epstein list even does exist (which assumes he was stupid enough to just maintain a master list of clients, and he and his associates were stupid enough not to destroy it once the Feds came calling), its revelation to the public would mean nothing. We have lists of the people who visited his island and flew on his plane, so the exposure of the list would only exonerate people, not implicate anyone who isn’t already a suspect.

If Trump is on the list, it would mean nothing. MAGA would claim the Biden admin created it or manipulated it. Maybe a sliver of conservatives who like Trump but aren’t super interested in politics might split off from him, but most of the people who could have a “Trump is bad actually” wakeup call have probably already had it, in year 9 of this circus.

It seems like for the last month, all liberals have wanted to talk about is the Epstein list, and they’ve entirely forgotten that Israel is currently moving forward with its plan to annex Gaza. They cared for a hot minute that the FCC is trying to take anyone who defies Trump off the air, but now we’re back to Epstein. And I’ve seen no posts as of yet about the fact that Pete Hegseth is going to do a Stalin-style purge of the military next Tuesday.

I do not care one bit who is on the Epstein list. Other than possibly some celebrities, anyone who might be on it would be a powerful politician or businessman, i.e. I already don’t like them. The Epstein list epitomizes liberals caring more about Trump’s aesthetics than his substance, and their hopes for some magic bullet that will ruin him.

I presume what will happen is the MAGA will splinter off into smaller groups of more extreme and likely even some militant groups. They will still hold many similar views but, I belive that each group will rally around a new leader, many of them likely being on a local level, some on a regional and some on a national but, thier unity will be gone. There will be a lot of infighting between the groups (well, more than what we see now) as they try to get everyone to join thier camp. There will be a lot more political violence as they struggle to make thier specific group relevant. There will also be a lot more domestic terrorism for both that reason and because they need people to fear them (inflates self-importance and allows them to feel superior).

1nad88n,CMV: It's illogical and suspicious when modern white Americans feel personally attacked by criticisms of historical slave owners and racists," I want to try and understand a phenomenon I see all the time.  
  
Whenever there's a discussion about the actions of  racist historical figures (like a founding father who owned slaves or a 19th century politician who enacted racist policies )some white Americans react as if they are being personally attacked in the present day. I believe this reaction is not only illogical but also creates suspicion where there might not need to be any.  
  
One of the the ways this shows up is when talking about the fact that chattel slavery was bad and somebody goes  ""Well, Black people owned slaves too!"" .This is often presented as a ""gotcha"" moment, as if it should make Black people feel hypocritical or ashamed.  
  
As a Black person, I might roll mt etes so hard a contact falls out but I don't , and othe rblack people, dont feel any kind of motivation to defend those people. The handful of Black individuals who participated in the chattel slave system  as actual owners are viewed as sellouts, traitors, and awful human beings by black people 

  
I bet most people, Black or white, can't even name one of them. This isn't because they didn't exist; it's because we feel no need to celebrate, defend, or build nuance around them. There are no statues of William Ellison Jr. We don't name schools after him. His actions aren't seen as a reflection on us, because we universally condemn what he did. We see no need to try and celebrate teh :culture"" of a black slave owner.  We see them as suckers who were on the wrong side of history.  
  
So for the people who do feel some kind of way just because an evill person from 200 years ago shares your skin color (or hair texture) Why are yall taking on that burden Criticizing the institution of slavery and the people who upheld it is not an attack on a modern person's identity. Acknowledging that a historical figure was a brutal slave owner is not an indictment of you, a person living in 2025. Holding the government accountable and not sugar coating it is not abouut attack you, since you aren't the gov  
  
And  when someone rushes to defend that historical figure or deflect the criticism, it feels profoundly weird. It makes me wonder, ""Why feel the need to take up for this racist person from 200 years ago?"" It's like you are voluntarily taking on the burden of their sins.  
  
This reaction (for me at least)  is what creates suspicion. It makes us feel like you aren't just defending a historical figure, but that you identify with them and are, on some level, defending the ideology that powered their actions.

1n8mwjl,"CMV: Cheating is always, without exception, the responsibility of the person who cheated","Whenever cheating comes up, there’s often this attempt to spread the blame. People say things like, “Well, maybe if the partner had been more attentive, or more exciting, or more supportive, the cheating wouldn’t have happened.” 

But I’ve thought about this a lot, and I’m convinced that cheating is always, without exception, the responsibility of the person who cheats.

Why? Because no matter what problems exist in a relationship, the cheating partner always has other choices. If someone is unhappy, they can communicate. They can try counselling. They can suggest a break. They can even leave. What they can’t do, without crossing a moral line, is betray the trust they agreed to uphold. 

Cheating isn’t some inevitable force of nature; it’s a deliberate act that requires secrecy and deception. That’s why the fault lies solely with the person who makes that choice.

Think about it: if a student is struggling in class because the teacher isn’t very engaging, is it the teacher’s fault if the student cheats on an exam? Of course not. The student still chose to cheat, even if they had valid frustrations. Relationships work the same way. Dissatisfaction is never an excuse for betrayal.

1n6tlrc,"CMV: Conservatives would probably be okay with, or even defend pre-1939 Hitler.","Heres a take that will make a lot of conservatives assmad, if you took Hitlers pre-1939 policies and rhetoric, stripped the name ''Hitler'' off, and just described them in plain terms, a lot of conservatives today would not only be fine with them, they'd cheer them on. I actually did this with a family member who lives in Florida, i ascribed a bunch of Hitlers' policies and rhetoric onto Trump, and he defended them, and then once i said that actually those were Hitlers, he kinda laughed and said ''You got me there kid'' and moved on lol.

Hitler didnt roll out of bed one day and build Auschwitz. Pre-1939, his moves were ''defending tradition'', ''restoring order'', and ''making Germany great again'' Sound familiar?

Demonizing minorities as scapegoats: Hitler blamed Jews for Germanys economic and social decline. Trump does the same with immigrants, Muslims, and anyone he can label as an ''outsider'' ruining America.

Cult of personality and nationalism: Hitler positioned himself as Germanys savior, demanding total loyalty. Trump does the same, openly bragging about being above the law and demanding loyalty oaths, like when Bill Barr, a huge Trump dickrider, when he wouldn't lie about the 2020 election for him, he was instantly exiled from the party, and conservatives still, to this day, call him a RINO.

Attacking the press: Hitler called journalists ''Lugenpresse'' (lying press). Trump calls the media the ''enemy of the people'' and spams lawsuits to anyone who says mean things about him.

Undermining democracy: Hitler didnt destroy the Weimar republic overnight, he chipped away at it, attacking elections, delegitimizing opponents, and normalizing authoritarian power grabs. Trump literally tried to overturn an election he lost in 2020, he lost the election, fabricated lies about how it was a top-down conspiracy to steal the election from him, and then tried to pressure officials to ''find votes'', then tried to steal the vote through false slates of electors and an insurrection.

Violent rhetoric and political intimidation: Hitler used brownshirts to intimidate opponents. Trump calls on his supporters to ''fight like hell'' and send his people to storm the capitol in an attempt to stay in power, excuses political violence (Jan 6), and promises pardons for insurrectionists.

If you presented all that to conservatives today without saying the name Hitler, they'd probably defend it, or even be okay with it. And if you did point out it was Hitler, they'd say ''Well, Trump hasn't built death camps yet'' and dismiss the comparison outright, proving my point.

The problem is people think Hitler only became Hitler when the Holocaust started. But by then, the groundwork was already laid, and it was too late. Thats why making these comparisons matters now. Pretending everythings fine until the gas chambers show up is historically illiterate and politically suicidal.

And for the dumbasses who is just gonna ask me about if i think Trump is gonna build death camps or whatever, no, i dont think that, and thats not the point of the comparison.

Also, anyone that wanna say im trivializing the holocaust victims or whatever, Anne Franks sister, a holocaust survivor, has also made the same comparison, so if you say im trivializing it, say the same to a survivor of it.",123kallem,393,645,0.7200000286102295,0.1230760737363183,1756842618,/r/changemyview/comments/1n6tlrc/cmv_conservatives_would_probably_be_okay_with_or/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-02 19:50:18
1n9utv1,CMV: The Media Needs To Stop 'Girlsplaining' Men's Loneliness. This Isn’t Helping,"Lately, I’ve posts and videos along the lines of “Men under 30 are single because they don’t talk about their feelings.”

I want to push back on this, because it feels incredibly condescending almost like a form of ""girlsplaining."" It’s not that I am struggling to form friendships or can’t express myself emotionally. That narrative is overly simplistic and honestly insulting. I've spoke to some of my Dads Matters friends and they have the same feeling around this matter. It assumes we’re emotionally stunted children who just need to “be better” or “open up” and all of our problems will magically be solved.

Telling men to “do better” or to “just talk about feelings” is about as helpful as telling a depressed person to “just cheer up.” as I would know as I have had clinical depression since I was 19 now i'm 31 and a single Dad. It might sound good and empowering, but it’s vague and completely ignores the social reality we live in. Modern men are told to be more open.. to share our struggles, to express our vulnerability. But when we actually do it, the response is often dismissive, mocking, or outright rejecting. I have lost female and male friends over the years just from opening up, the word 'high maintenence' was used. Would friends prefer their friends were emotionless?

That’s the part these commentators keep missing.

When a guy tells his friends or family that he’s lonely, the answer is often, “Man up,” “Just hit the gym,” or “Stop whining.” When a guy tells a date that he’s having a hard time, there’s a risk it will be seen as weakness or neediness. Even on social media, when men post honestly about feeling isolated or hopeless, the comments can be brutal: “This is why you can’t get a girlfriend,” “Be a man,” or worse, outright shaming.

So yes, men could talk more about our feelings but we already know that talking isn’t free. There’s a social cost to it, and the people telling us to “open up” rarely address that.

That’s why so many of these takes feel like ragebait. They frame men’s loneliness as a problem men are too stubborn to solve, as if we secretly enjoy being isolated. It’s blaming the patient for the disease.

If people were genuinely trying to help, here’s what would actually be constructive:

Stop generalizing. Not all men are emotionally closed-off cavemen.

Stop being vague... what does “do better” even mean in practical terms?

Stop being patronizing... we don’t need lectures, we need allies.

In person and online socials to male vulnerability is often negative... and that this is a cultural issue, not just a “men won’t talk” issue.


This isn’t about rejecting growth or refusing to be emotionally healthy. It’s about asking people especially journalists and influencers to diagnose the problem honestly instead of falling back on topics they do not fully understand nore have the degrees to make unqualified explainations. If we want to reduce male loneliness, we have to talk about the stigma men face when we actually do share. Otherwise, all this advice is just performative noise.

1nirejb,"CMV: As an American born in 1968, 2025 is the first time in my life that I need to be concerned about being targeted or attacked by my own government for speaking out politically.","It is often said that the First Amendment doesn't mean your speech, expression and opinions are free from consequences.  It only means that you are protected from the *government* implementing consequences for your speech, expression and opinions.  I do not believe that is true in 2025 (since Trump's second term began).

Never before have I had to worry about criticizing a President or other politician.  Prior to 2025, I was never gave a second thought to saying something critical of the government or a politician on the town square, or posting something online.  

I was cognizant that those expressions *could* be used by my employer, friends, acquaintances and others to make evaluations of my character and determine their future involvement with me in their lives.  But I was never hesitant to express those opinions because I thought it would make me a target of the government.

But now I find myself holding back on some expressions *precisely* because I fear reprisal from the government.  Do I think I'll get thrown in prison for months or years because of my speech?  No (at least not in 2025, but check back in a few years).  But will government harass me at customs after an overseas trip because of my speech?  Yes, it's a concern.  Will police and prosecutors treat me differently if they're aware of my speech critical of the government?  Yes, I think they will.

Some of it comes from just an overall change in tone from the government since the Trump administration took over.  But a lot of it is just listening to what the administration says.  Things like Pam Bondi saying that they'll come after people for ""hate speech"".  Or the DOJ investigating people (like John Bolton) that Trump considers to be personal enemies.

So there are two ways my view could be changed here.  First, you could point out that I always should have been moderating my speech for fear of government blowback.  I considered whether this was true during Trump's first term, but I don't think it was.  We went through the George Floyd protests without government really targeting people simply for their words and other expressions of speech.  And outside of Trump's first term, I don't see any time in my lifetime that it would even be debatable that people needed to be concerned.

The second way to change my view would be to show me and convince me that I'm just being paranoid and that the government doesn't really care about what the fuck I say, no matter how critical it is.  I think that used to be true as an ""average Joe"".  No one in government would ever really know what I said.  But now we've got a whole MAGA army of online warriors who bring speech they disagree with to the attention of people in government.  That never really happened before the days of social media.

I also don't think the argument of ""Trump has bigger fish to fry; you don't need to worry"" works for me.  Logically, you would think they'd go after someone like AOC or Gavin Newsome before worrying about little ol me.  But I think that those more prominent critics have some protection (that I don't have) simply because they have a bullhorn.  If Newsome got detained for 8 hours by Customs after an overseas trip, it'd be international news for days.  But if it happens to me, no one would ever even know about it.",ProblematicTrumpCard,1456,303,0.8700000047683716,0.1214753235485113,1758051352,/r/changemyview/comments/1nirejb/cmv_as_an_american_born_in_1968_2025_is_the_first/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-16 19:35:52
1nshaiz,CMV: the main reason for sending the National Guard into Portland is to foment “left wing” violence that justifies a full “left wing” crackdown,"During the previous Trump administration, Portland, Oregon was a wellspring for right wing propaganda about reactionary left and right wing. Since the main provocateurs that time were right wing paramilitary cosplayers that weren’t very appealing themselves, the mainstream perception wasn’t a tidy narrative that could be easily capitalized on: for those that didn’t look closely, it was a situation out of control. 

Today, we have the federal government spoiling for a fight—attempting to provoke an antifa response: the Republicans badly need this response to position themselves properly for the 2026 election:

1.  Any supposed organized violence will be used as a propaganda victory: the left is violent and against law and order. 

2.  That violence - insofar as it can be - will be a pretext to cut off political funding to wide swathes of loosely connected left wing groups during an election year: “we see links between Portland’s ANTIFA groups and mainstream democratic groups and their funding of violence must be frozen in its tracks.” A pliant Supreme Court will likely allow this overreach during a key window of fundraising and advertising and message, as they have with all manner of executive power. They may later leash it back, but it would be in June or July of 2026, too late to make a difference. 

3.  The federal control of the situation will not have the same problems that non-federal crime has: hapless, semi-competent, less politically aligned local law enforcement.  It will be all Republican controlled investigations and communications. Being able to have the full end-to-end control can yield a better propaganda outcome. 

4. They just have to keep it contained to Portland, though, because they have realized that it is far harder to control the “left wing violence” story in major media markets like New York, DC and LA: there are too many people who are too connected and don’t fit their script easily enough, so they risk looking like bullies as much as powerful leaders.

1n83fts,CMV: Trump sending the guard into Chicago will accomplish absolutely nothing long term. Looking at you conservatives.,"Recently served 8 years. Sergeant in Active Army Infantry and Army National Guard Infantry with 2x deployments, 1 SE mobilization, and a couple activations to wildfires, George Floyd riots/protests, and orders to the border at one point. Served during later half of Obama's 2nd term and through Trump's 1st term. 

I'd also truly like to hear from conservative and conservate veterans on their logic if they support Trump's decision. And yes my POV is sassy lol. 

My POV: 

Anyone who's served in the guard knows most activations like these are a complete waste of time. 

What did we do at the border? And dont even lie. We sat around and looked busy and we hurried up and waited for nothing. We weren't tackling immigrants or chasing them down like NFL linebackers. They didn't even have the logistics to know what to do with us nor the resources to even keep us there long term. A quarter of the guys weren't even getting paid right and half had their orders cut into half so they couldn't qualify for BAH. We weren't shooting immigrants, and we'd post up at some random spot and do jack shit. A few dudes on longer term orders might be flying Ravens but that's separate from a unit activation. Didn't matter Texas guard, Cali guard, or AZ guard. We weren't doing shit. 

Even especially today, 95% of guard dudes have never deployed and barely do any legit MOS training outside of their 2-3 week semi-casual AT in the summer at whichever Fort Shithole(in this case probably McCoy or the Indiana one). 

You think we're going to post squads of privates and specialists in O-block and have them return fire against gangs in the area? Get real. Activate any MP unit in Illinois right now and 1/4th are 23 year old college students that barely qual and barely pass PT tests consistently. The other 1/4th construction workers or office workers, and the rest a mix of actually in law enforcement, jobless, or something else irrelevant. 

It's a dog and pony show for Trump to pander to the ""mUh ReD WHitE n BLuE. Muh HeRiTaGe"" part of America. These guard dudes are going to be kicking rocks in middle class or highly visible areas trying to look busy and not get yelled at by their plt sgt or squad leader. ""Presence patrols"" in all the neighborhoods that don't have high crime to begin with. Just like DC...kicking rocks and picking up trash. Truly Amazing crime fighters. 

It's a waste of taxpayer money, and what's even the long term goal? Just keep the guard in these cities forever and do what? Or is it going to be Trump and his traveling band of guard members going from state to state ""saving America"" one liberal city at a time. 

I genuinely want to know how Trump activating and constantly threatening to activate the guard whether Chicago or somewhere else is actually going to fight crime long term.

1ndogsc,CMV: Reddit is radicalizing people,"Touched by both the shootings today had to say this that reddit is doing a terrible job to moderate this site.

Every day it takes 10 seconds on the feed to find a bunch of people fearmongering each other and advociting for others deaths or assault.

This does not go for every subreddit, but i can count more than 10 major subreddits behaving this way.

Most comes from the nature of subreddits turning into ecochambers and it distorts perceptions of reality and enforces extreme views.

It radicalizes users by presenting distorted views as normal.

B Add counterargument how it is not a nazi state

1nnp4lq,CMV: liberal people should stay in red states,"I live in a “blueberry” city in a deep red state (Oklahoma). My city is very artsy, very queer, a center for black excellence, and has strong communities for just about any identity/interest. 

There’s an ongoing debate I’ve seen both online and in person about whether liberal/left-wing people should stay in red states, or whether they should move and join forces with likeminded people elsewhere. 

My argument: 
• The US has a maximum of 5 actually blue states. The states we think of as blue, specially California and New York, are actually red states with reallllllly big blueberries that sway the vote. 
• Because of the point above, it makes sense to stay in red states and cultivate blue cities. Taking your ideas to states with already established blue cities does less than growing those blueberries in states without them. 
• Personally I think of it as a moral imperative to stay here. Mainly to foster safety and community and protect resources for those who can’t afford to leave. The money I would use to leave is better invested in local programming. 

Counterarguments:
• Living in a red state is exhausting at best, and at worst actively dangerous. Every family, especially those with marginalized identities, should live in places that give them strength.
• Decades of liberal progress can be wiped out with a single event or bill. The Tulsa Massacre destroyed Black Wall Street. Red lining and highway building in the 80s was less obvious but had similar generational outcomes.

1njru4r,CMV: Illegal immigration is inherently unfair to legal immigrants(and citizens),"Context: Personally, I'm a second generation immigrant(asian), and my parents have always talked of how they had to wait years in order to enter the United States. Partly due to this, I always held the opinion that priority should significantly be given to legal immigrants, since they actually go through the long and arduous immigration process, rather than simply ""hopping the border."" Additionally, when I hear people talk about how they want a lot more courts in order to deal with illegal immigration cases, I also feel like this is a little unfair. These courts come at a cost, and I feel like allocating funds toward illegal immigration while the legal immigration system is a mess that almost encourage illegal immigration. 

Regarding citizens, a lot of people that oppose ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies point out that illegal immigrants commit less crimes than native-born citizens. While I do believe this statistic is true, I still feel like any crime committed by an illegal immigrant is inherently a policy failure. When it comes to crimes committed by illegal immigrants, it is a directly a product of the government's inability to enforce border control that leads to these crimes. This is really unfair, especially to the victim and the victim's family. Telling a family that their loved one was killed(just an example) just because the US was unable to reinforce their border just doesn't sit well with me. One murder committed by an illegal immigrant is one too many, and it doesn't make sense to just sit there and say that illegal immigration has no negative consequences on society(not trying to say they don't also benefit society). This issue(about crimes) I feel a little less strongly about, but since people are starting to advocate for defunding a police, something needs to be done about illegal immigrant crimes.

To wrap it up, I don't have any hard feelings against illegal immigrants or anything like that, just a belief I have that I would love to get input on from people with other worldviews, seeing as mine is pretty biased.",baljeetofficial,323,592,0.6200000047683716,0.1110748539458929,1758149433,/r/changemyview/comments/1njru4r/cmv_illegal_immigration_is_inherently_unfair_to/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-17 22:50:33
1ngoz5g,CMV: The Trump administration intentionally forces the economy into stagflation to tighten their autocratic grip on the US,"Since the beginning of the tariffs, I have wondered what the real goals of the Trump administration are regarding their economic policies. I never believed that they want to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, because economic realities cannot be changed that fast (not in months, not even in a couple of years; I think this takes decades if look at the rise of manufacturing in China, for instance).

We are now seeing clearer signs of stagflation (a combination of high inflation, stagnant economic growth, and elevated unemployment) happening in the US. There might be reasons for that outside the government’s control, but their policies don’t help—they make the issues much worse (tariffs, ICE raids on immigrant workers, firing people for political reasons, catering to tech companies to replace people’s jobs with AI).

I understand that making America more economically independent, especially in terms of manufacturing items related to national security (computer chips, pharmaceuticals, military equipment, etc.), is a reasonable goal when you anticipate a conflict/war with China in the future. But if that were your goal, your policies would look much different. You would not put blanket tariffs over the whole world and get rid of all your trading partners and allies all at once. You would do that more strategically and selectively, per industry and country, over a longer period of time.

I also don’t believe that they themselves believe their own narratives, because (apart from Trump and a bunch of other rather dumb people in the administration) there are actually quite a few smart people in this administration who probably know better and should be able to anticipate the effects of their policies. People like Scott Bessent, Peter Navarro, or JD Vance, I believe, can anticipate the consequences (or at least see them now that they are happening) of the policies, but still push them forward. It could be that all these people are just blinded by their conservative groupthink, or are just pleasing Trump until he is gone, or that they are simply profiting from these conditions by being in on the scheme (tariff extraction money flows to Trump and also into their pockets). The last point is probably true, but it would be a dangerous game for them if they did not have bigger plans beyond that. Otherwise, they must fear prosecution after their terms are over.

So, in my mind, the main explanation that is left is that this administration is intentionally inflicting conditions that lead to stagflation in the economy. Now, in a functioning democratic system, heavy ongoing stagflation would lead to public resistance and either the end of such policies or the end of the government. But when you have a government that already has strong autocratic tendencies, stagflation might just perfectly play into their hands. The rising economic hardships can be used to fuel the division of the people and scapegoating toward minorities further. When a lot of people lose their jobs, they are more dependent on the government, which can actively interfere in corporate decisions and provide loyalists with jobs/positions instead of political enemies (look at more stable autocratic countries like Russia, Turkey, Serbia, Hungary, for instance). Intensifying protests are then just another reason to restrict freedoms even more for national emergency reasons. All of this leads to greater centralization of power for the autocratic leadership.

My point is, I believe that the economic policies are intentionally implemented to create stagflation, and in response, transform America into a more stable autocracy. How to change my mind? I guess the main point to argue is the intentionality of it all, but there are probably hundreds of arguments why this is not happening, and I would like to hear them all.",Go_Improvement_4501,1618,166,0.9300000071525574,0.1076245120854351,1757849671,/r/changemyview/comments/1ngoz5g/cmv_the_trump_administration_intentionally_forces/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-14 11:34:31
1nmxg59,"CMV: Most people who label themselves ""conservative"" are like the Joker and their goal in life is to prove you're just as bad and rotten as they are, and that you are a hypocrite","I am noticing a pattern among conservatives where they know a viewpoint they hold is objectively bad for society meaning it *will* lead to overall bad outcomes and they know it will, but they still hold on to this viewpoint because it is so deeply ingrained within them, and they feel it is ingrained in others as well, and so they project that back out to the public. They feel everyone else is *virtue signaling* about really not being racist or sexist, and they have a goal to prove you are just as bad as they are 😏

One of their favorite quotes from a few years ago was ""everyone is racist,"" after all. Uh, sir, I am black in the United States of America and while I know some black people are racist, I cannot afford to be and most other black people would agree with me. 

It's like the dynamic between the Joker and The Batman. The Joker is always trying to push The Batman past his limit to show that Batman is just as sick and twisted as the Joker. This is the Joker seeking validation of his own existence, and I think the same can be said for conservatives. 

When people talk about improving society a bit and making life here on earth just a little bit better for humanity, it is always the conservative that says shit like ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions,"" which is usually out of context as that quote applies to ""good intentions"" that are not well-thought out ahead of time, but we are a modern, scientifically-advanced super power, so I think we will be OK with trying to improve things in this society and around the world. 

Anyway, when I am talking to a conservative it is always like talking to the same two or three guys, so at least I know what I am dealing with, but it is so frustrating that we cannot make the world a better place because we have these psychopathic Jokers playing these little, psychological game with all of us to affirm their own existence, and that they are not ""bad"" and how they feel the world should be organized (some weird hierarchy usually) is justified 🤣",BeezusCHrist_,365,555,0.6800000071525574,0.1072464098021937,1758474389,/r/changemyview/comments/1nmxg59/cmv_most_people_who_label_themselves_conservative/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-21 17:06:29
1nnrpi4,CMV: The Problem is that we fundamentally disagree on what our rights should be,"This post is about the US but if you feel like this is happening where you live feel free to provide more examples.

I used to think that the left and right could incrementally move forward together even on divisive issues on the basis that we all benefit from a shared foundation of power for citizens.

I no longer believe that. I think that the only way you can explain the staying power and propaganda value of issues like gay rights and abortion is that some people genuinely do not believe we should all have the same rights. I don’t know how many people it is, because we don’t actually ever poll that question. Most polls it looks like actually assume we do all come from a shared perspective on rights.

And I think we have to acknowledge this problem and try to measure it somehow if we are going to have a solution to divisiveness in modern politics.

1ndt9qw,CMV: Charlie Kirk’s death was orchestrated by the Trump administration.,"So a few things…

1. Charlie Kirk was one of the few right wing podcasters arguing for the release of the Epstein files. Even after having said he was ready to move on he brought it back up claiming essentially the ball was in the admins court and they needed to respond.

Obviously, this isn’t great for Trump and it would be beneficial to silence this dissent. It can’t be done legitimately so more drastic action was needed. 

2. The attempt on Trumps life in PA left a lot of unanswered questions. So many holes and gaps that it makes one wonder if that could have been staged. If that was staged then so too could Kirk’s murder have been arranged. Eerily similar circumstances as well between the Trump assassination attempt and the murder of Kirk.

3. Kirk made it known that he felt certain people committed more acts of gun violence against civilians than any other group. In fact, that was the topic of discussion when Kirk was murdered. Within the last week, WH spokesperson Leavitt said the administration was looking at taking gun rights away from specific people. Kirk’s murder would give the WH justification for going after gun rights of people they don’t like including LQBTQ, minorities, democrats, etc.

Kirk was easily expendable yet beloved by young right wing people. His death will resonate more with the youth than other right wing propagandist. This will help appeal the Trump admin to the youth and also take some heat off the Epstein files, Poland invoking article 4, and Israel’s strike on Qatar. CMV that this isn’t a conspiracy theory.

Are you conservative? We can't get crime or immigration under control. So, shouting about the death of democracy is not causing the pearl clutching one might expect.

1n6scrr,CMV: Blasphemy laws are an abomination and should be internationally banned.,"I believe blasphemy laws are fundamentally incompatible with freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and basic human rights. Today, blasphemy is punishable in more than 60 countries, and in a few — such as Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia — it can even carry the death penalty.

In many cases, these laws are used to silence dissent, target minorities, or settle personal grudges. For example, accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan have led to mob violence, imprisonment, and executions. In countries like Nigeria and Egypt, blasphemy charges have been brought against writers, activists, and even children for things like social media posts.

To me, this is an abuse of law at the deepest level: punishing people not for harming others, but for offending ideas or religious authorities. Protecting religious sensibilities at the expense of human liberty seems backwards.

International human rights frameworks already condemn torture, slavery, and other practices considered incompatible with human dignity. I believe blasphemy laws belong in the same category — they should be abolished everywhere.

CMV: Am I overlooking cultural, legal, or practical reasons why blasphemy laws should remain? Is there any valid argument for their existence that outweighs the harm they cause?",the_secular,878,325,0.8999999761581421,0.0960615782261886,1756839751,/r/changemyview/comments/1n6scrr/cmv_blasphemy_laws_are_an_abomination_and_should/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-02 19:02:31
1n8kicn,"CMV: Men and women, broadly speaking, are equally shallow.","I got caught in a small debate between two friends — one male, one female — over what counts as a dad bod. Friend A was making the point that she didn’t need her man to be in super tight shape to find him attractive, she was comfortable with him in his current, “dad bod” form. Friend B, and me, however had seen her husband and vociferously objected that her husband was not “dad bod” material. He was in great, great shape before they had their two kids and since then he gained maybe 15 pounds of fat. 

He was still the benefitting from 8 years of consistent effort in the gym and it showed in his biceps and quads. Friend B said real dad bods aren’t super in-shape men that gained 10 pounds, they’re Homer Simpson lol and that she and most women would aren’t attracted to that. 

The debate then moved onto *what* counts as a dad bod. But for me, it helped crystallize and articulate an idea I’ve had for awhile. 

*Most of the debates about what “women want” are men trying to tell women that they’re just as shallow as men are. They’re just in denial.*

**It’s the inverse of this common situation:** a man or men online say they’re just as attracted to “natural” girls who don’t use a lot of makeup as they are to girls who wear a “full face”. 

**Which is followed by:** women harshly point out that, actually, the natural women they cited are wearing *just* as much makeup and that they’re deluding themselves into thinking they’re more progressive then they actually are. 

Or the often beaten dead horse of “men only treat women like human beings if they can fuck them”. 

Because in their lives they’ve seen how pretty privilege favors some women over their ugly or average sisters. In the same ways, men when they debate “what women want” they’re pointing out that men who *don’t* look like Homer Simpson or have a beer gut tend to do better with women then others.

1nsrzir,CMV: Israel is purposely leaving hamas as an excuse to genocide and drag the palestinian conflict.,"Israel is purposely leaving Hamas alive as an excuse to justify what is really a systematic campaign against Palestinians. They have repeatedly shown they can carry out small tactical strikes with surgical precision, like in Iran, where they don’t need any justification and have done it. With Hamas, they don’t take that approach because they need a reason to escalate. It’s not about eliminating a real threat because they clearly could if they wanted but about keeping the narrative alive that they are “defending themselves” while slowly carrying out a larger plan against the Palestinian population.

This goes beyond military strategy into deliberate political and social manipulation. By keeping Hamas in place, Israel ensures there is always an excuse for attacks that target civilians, infrastructure, and entire communities. Every operation can be framed as retaliation, giving cover for what is effectively a campaign of genocide. Hamas is not a threat they cannot handle, it is a tool they use to legitimize violence while the true goal of controlling, displacing, and devastating Palestinians continues without challenge.",Ragu_Ugar,149,537,0.6000000238418579,0.0935457283672614,1759075219,/r/changemyview/comments/1nsrzir/cmv_israel_is_purposely_leaving_hamas_as_an/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-28 16:00:19
1nnjx9f,CMV: The political alignment of the Charlie Kirk assassination does not matter.,"You have the left saying the shooter was right leaning. Then you have the right saying the shooter was left leaning. Then over there is a study showing that the majority of political violence comes from the right and then this study here that says the majority of political violence comes from the left. Guys. THIS DOES NOT MATTER. The political views of the shooter does not matter and here are the two main reasons why.

**1. They do not share the views of the entire political spectrum.**

This is pretty obvious. If the killer is a leftist, that doesn't mean every leftist is suddenly a violent terrorist looking to kill anyone who shares a belief they don't like. If the killer is a rightist, that doesn't mean every rightist is suddenly a violent terrorist looking to kill anyone who shares a belief they don't like. Saying otherwise is entire political posturing. You are trying to demonize a large group of normal people for no reason than politics. 

**2. It sews division where there shouldn't be division.**

Kirk's assassination is horrible. In one day, a man lost his life, a woman lost her husband, two young children lost their father, and many people lost a friend. I didn't care for Charlie Kirk. I didn't agree with much of what came out of his mouth. I didn't believe he was a good debater. I did believe he was a pretty hateful person. But that doesnt stop me for having empathy on what people lost that day, and it shouldn't stop you either. Thats what people should be focusing on right now. The tragedy of it all. Not ""the killer believes this"" or ""no the killer believes that."" But instead ""This was horrible,"" and ""You're right, how do we stop this from happening again.""

At the end of the day, the political ideology of the killer doesn't change anything. It doesn't suddenly mean all leftist or all rightist are violent. And it shouldn't be used to further divide people in an already greatly divided country. Political violence has no place in the United States. If you believe it does, kindly leave. We don't want you here. This of course goes for left and right cause both are doing it across the spectrum. To change my mind on this subject, you'll have to refute my reasoning or provide a good logical argument for why the political views of the killer matter when faced with the negatives I've already mentioned. 

Edit: I've had my mind changed with one reason. That being that its important to know the political ideology of the killer to determine what views cause this kind of violence. I'll still be debating here to see if anyone can bring up more points, though, so if you have anything else, feel free to comment.

1n6laea,CMV: Blind Partisan Loyalty is why America can never find the sweet spot to get things right.,"Addressing both Left and Right-wing here.

To explain ""Blind Loyalty"". Let's compare it to sports betting as a metaphorical analogy. 

The ""Average Sports Fan"" always bets on his team out of emotional attachment, belief, passion, and hatred for the rival team. Based purely on subconscious emotional biases and any positive data they can rationalize, without objective verification or calculation. When they lose, they will always justify it somehow, and do it again next time. Most people are ""Average Sports Fans"" when it comes to politics. 

The ""Professional Sports Better"" bets on the team most likely to win based on data, not on emotions. They look at statistics, analytics, medical records, history, and so on. They will even pay insiders for classified information, hackers for access to private social media accounts, and paparazzi for intrusive personal information. If they have any emotional biases as fans, they have to shut it down for the sake of being as objective as possible.

In any Competition or Conflict of Interest. All parties are incentivized to do whatever it takes to improve and maintain a good image, while tarnishing the others. This means lying, omission, reframing, information warfare tactics. They are incentivized to say the truth ""as is"" only when it benefits them the most. Which is rare, they will always exaggerate or underrate truthful information, if they do release any.

I've been on both sides. But ever since I began investing and learning analytics. I've learned to become neutrally objective. Being bias when you are investing money is guaranteed bankruptcy.

Unlike Sports, the solution isn't two-sided. It's much more complex. All sides could be completely wrong and partially right, or one side can be completely correct. Scientists have the ""Scientific Method"" to figure out who is right. The scientific method teaches you to be agnostic with your initial ""Hypothesis"" & ""Conclusions"" and to suppress biases. Through research, debate, and experimentation, old ideas are changed based on the results. Once the correct Conclusion is proven with undeniable evidence, it will be (usually) universally accepted without doubt. 

Today we have services like Ground News that compile, sort, and summarize data for you. We have free AI chatbots. There are neutral analyst Influencers that package it for you accurately, but they are never as popular as partisan ones. Point, is you don't have to be a Data Scientist or Wall Street Analyst. Yet people still choose to go with what best reinforces their emotional biases.

To give you an example of the ""Sweet Spot"".   
Blanket immunity for police was a source of police brutality and abuse of power. Instead of sensible reforms, we went with ""Defund the Police"" which ended up increasing crime. Now we are back to even more police immunity, and as a consequence of DTP, many police departments are undermanned, so now they are ramping up recruitment and speeding up training. Which means lower quality officers with a lot more power. The sweetspot wasn't Defund the Police. It was more funding for training, higher standards for officers, and more accountability with less immunity. As seen in other countries. Even former DTP and BLM activists have come to this conclusion.

Apply this context to many other issues such as immigration, economics, and etc. We will always struggle to figure it out regardless of the situation with how we think and vote.

Just ask I can give more examples. ",NomadicVikingRonin,227,475,0.6299999952316284,0.0875121129825423,1756823961,/r/changemyview/comments/1n6laea/cmv_blind_partisan_loyalty_is_why_america_can/,2025,9,changemyview,2025-09-02 14:39:21
