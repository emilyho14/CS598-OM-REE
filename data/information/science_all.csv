Reddit Submission: [In 2013, France massively increased dividend tax rates. This led firms to reduce dividends (payments to shareholders) and invest profits back into the firm. Contrary to some claims, dividend taxes do not lead to a misallocation of capital, but may instead reduce capital misallocation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/x2efzp/in_2013_france_massively_increased_dividend_tax/)

The article [""Dividend Taxes and the Allocation of Capital""](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20210369) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.113.7.2053) from *American Economic Review* as of July 7, 2023. Inconsistencies in the study's code were identified by other researchers and [submitted as a comment](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20221432) to the journal. They argue that these flaws drove the paper's main findings and that, after correction, ""leaves no clear event study evidence of a positive effect of dividend taxation on investment.""

The corresponding author [disputes this claim](https://www.dropbox.com/s/skenqoxmygjxfcr/retraction_note_for_website.pdf), citing the [retraction notice](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.113.7.2053), which states the paper was retracted by him at the Editor's request ""on the grounds of a coding error in the rendering of a figure and a procedural error in the publication process."" He maintains that both errors ""were made in good faith"" and that neither alteration changed the conclusions of the study.

Reddit Submission: [Wearing hearing aids could help cut the risk of dementia, according to a large decade-long study. The research accounted for other factors, including loneliness, social isolation and depression, but found that untreated hearing loss still had a strong association with dementia](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/12ls0pi/wearing_hearing_aids_could_help_cut_the_risk_of/)

The article [""Association between hearing aid use and all-cause and cause-specific dementia: an analysis of the UK Biobank cohort""](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(23)00048-8) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00314-0) from *The Lancet Public Health* as of December 12, 2023. The accompanying [editorial](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(23)00083-X) and [commentary](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(23)00058-0) articles have also been retracted. As [reported by Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/04/we-should-have-followed-up-lancet-journal-retracts-article-on-hearing-aids-and-dementia-after-prodding/), concerns were raised by Jure Mur, a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh, after he was unable to replicate the paper's results while attempting a related analysis.

After being stonewalled by the authors and months of back-and-forth correspondence with the journal, Mur, *et al.*, submitted [a comment article](https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2_comment_article.docx.pdf) formally documenting their concerns. The journal solicited the [authors' response](https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3.1_author_response.pdf), but declined to publish either document. In their response, the authors noted they had ""found some discrepancies between coding schemes"" and described a new analysis of the data. These new results aligned with the findings of Mur, *et al.*, contradicting the original published paper. However, the authors did not request a retraction or major correction as part of their response. Several weeks later, after continued pressure from Mur, [the journal announced](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00314-0) the authors had requested a retraction after after discovering ""errors in their analysis which render their findings and conclusions false and misleading.""

A spokesperson for *The Lancet* issued the following statement to Retraction Watch:

>While acknowledging ""some discrepancies between coding systems"", they argued that ""The overall message of the study did not change."" In good faith, we accepted the authors' explanation, and decided not to publish the exchange. In retrospect, we should have followed up the admitted discrepancies more assiduously and worked with the authors and Dr Mur to settle any outstanding uncertainties. Dr Mur rightly challenged our decision in an email on November 16. We immediately recognised the seriousness of his concerns and wrote again to the authors on November 22 asking them to further clarify their analyses, based on Dr Mur's evidence and our own by now heightened unease. On November 24, the authors reported major errors in their paper, which rendered their findings and conclusions false and misleading. We moved quickly to retract the paper on December 12, 2023.

Concerns were raised about [unethical conduct by researchers](https://qz.com/1809184/psychedelic-therapy-has-a-sexual-abuse-problem-3) associated with the project at the MP-4 study site in Vancouver, Canada ([NCT01958593](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01958593)). The authors have since confirmed that **they were aware** of these violations at the time of submission but did not disclose this information to the journal or remove the data generated by this site from their analysis.

The authors also failed to disclose a conflict of interest. Several of the authors are affiliated with either the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) or MAPS Public Benefit Corporation (MAPS PBC), a subsidiary that is wholly owned by MAPS. MAPS fully funded and provided the MDMA that was used in this trial, and MAPS PBC organized the trial.

>This year’s Nobel Prize honors two scientists for their discovery of a  fundamental principle governing how gene activity is regulated.  
>  
>The information stored within our chromosomes can be likened to an  instruction manual for all cells in our body. Every cell contains the  same chromosomes, so every cell contains exactly the same set of genes  and exactly the same set of instructions. Yet, different cell types,  such as muscle and nerve cells, have very distinct characteristics. How  do these differences arise? The answer lies in gene regulation, which  allows each cell to select only the relevant instructions. This ensures  that only the correct set of genes is active in each cell type.  
>  
>Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were interested in how different cell  types develop. They discovered microRNA, a new class of tiny RNA  molecules that play a crucial role in gene regulation. Their  groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene  regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms,  including humans. It is now known that the human genome codes for over  one thousand microRNAs. Their surprising discovery revealed an entirely  new dimension to gene regulation. MicroRNAs are proving to be  fundamentally important for how organisms develop and function.

While originally published almost 15 years ago and prior to the implementation of our current rules regarding reposts, flair, and link quality, these submissions garnered significant exposure on Reddit and enormous media coverage because of NASA's sensational press conference announcing the discovery.

The article [""A Bacterium That Can Grow by Using Arsenic Instead of Phosphorus""](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1197258) has been [retracted](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu5488) from _Science_ as of July 24, 2025. From the moment this paper was published online on December 2, 2010, it was [embroiled in controversy](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/science/arseniclife-felisa-wolfe-simon-retraction.html). _Science_ (and r/science) was flooded with commentary on the problems with the work and did not publish it in print until June 3, 2011, where it was accompanied by eight Technical Comments, a Technical Response from the authors, and a note from then Editor-in-Chief Bruce Alberts explaining the decision and timing. In July 2012, _Science_ published two papers showing that the bacterium was resistant to arsenate but did not incorporate it into biomolecules as originally claimed. However, the paper was not retracted in 2012 because Retractions were reserved at the time as an alert about data manipulation or for authors to provide information about post-publication issues.

The editors of _Science_ maintain the view that ""there was no deliberate fraud or misconduct on the part of the authors"" even to this day. However, their standards for retractions have expanded. If a paper's reported experiments do not support its key conclusions, even if no fraud or manipulation occurred, a Retraction is now considered appropriate. On the basis of the Technical Comments and the 2012 papers, _Science_ has decided to retract the article. All the living Authors disagree with the retraction and have [published an eLetter](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu5488#elettersSection) disputing the decision.
