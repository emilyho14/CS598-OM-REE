16zl0f3,"CMV: Most Biden Supporters aren't voting for Biden because they like him or his policies, they just hate Trump and the GOP","Reuploaded because I made an error in the original post

As Joe Biden and Donald Trump are signifcant favourites to lead both their respective parties into the 2024 election. So I think it's fair to say that the 2024 US election will be contested between these 2 candidates. I know Trump is going through some legal issues, but knowing rich, white billionaires, he'll probably be ok to run in 2024  
  
Reading online forums and news posts has led me to believe that a signifcant portion of those who voted for Biden in 2020, and will vote for him again 2024 aren't doing so because they like him and his policies, but rather, they are doing so because they do not support Donald Trump, or any GOP nomination.  
  
I have a couple of reasons for believing this. Of course as it is the nature of the sub. I am open to having these reasons challenged  
  
\-Nearly every time voting for Third Parties is mentioned on subs like r/politics, you see several comments along the lines of ""Voting Third Party will only ensure Trump wins."" This seems to be a prevailing opinion among many Democrats, and Biden supporters. I believe that this mentality is what spurs many left wingers and centrists who do NOT support Biden into voting for him. As they are convincted that voting for their preferred option could bolster Trump  
  
\-A Pew Research poll (link: https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/election-2020-voters-are-highly-engaged-but-nearly-half-expect-to-have-difficulties-voting/?utm\_content=buffer52a93&utm\_medium=social&utm\_source=twitter.com&utm\_campaign=buffer ) suggets up to 56% of Biden voters are simply voting for him because they don't want Trump in office. It's possible to suggest this is a mood felt among a similar portion of Biden voters, but then again, the poll only had \~2,000 responses. Regardless, I seem to get the feeling that a lot of Biden's supporters are almost voting out of spite for Trump and the GOP.  
  
Here's a CBC article on the same topic (https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-joe-biden-u-s-election-loathing-love-1.5798122)  
  
\-Biden's opinion polls have been poor, very poor. With some sources putting his approval rating as low as 33%, I find it hard to believe therefore that he'll receive votes from tens of millions of Americans because they all love him. Are opinion polls entirely reliable? No. But do they provide a President with a general idea of what the public thinks of then? In my opinion, yes. How can a President gain 270 electoral votes and the majority of the population's support when he struggles to gain 40%+ in approval ratings. For me, this is a clear sign of many people just choosing him not because they like Biden, but because they just don't want the GOP alternative.

17a59kt,"CMV: hating children as a whole is weird, evil, and sociopathic.","As someone who is currently childfree (I'm 23 and I don't plan on having children for at LEAST 6-7 years), and as someone who knows people who are permanently childfree for a variety of reasons, I believe that people - childfree or otherwise - who proclaim to **hate** children have sociopathic tendencies. In my opinion, it's one thing to be staunchly child free and to not be good with kids, even to not necessarily want to or prefer to be around kids for extended periods of time. But to me, it is very concerning and indicative of someone's character if they claim to downright hate children and if they are wishing harm to children, even in a so-called ""joking"" manner. Children are children for a reason - they are defenseless minor members of our society and it's a spoken and unspoken societal requirement for us to protect and subsidize them. 

Practical things aside, every one of us were a child at one point in the past, and many of us don't like to remember or acknowledge the period in our lives when we were quite literally novices to personhood and were trying to figure out how to exist as a human being in a space where the majority of the people around us are much older, taller, and wiser than us. And at a certain threshold, when we were *very* young children, we weren't even old enough to communicate our needs with words, which I'm sure is a very frustrating experience for many kids, if not all of them! I feel that to actively ignore this point about the experience of children is very misguided. 

Like, for those of us who have worked with children or been around kids for extended periods of time in some capacity, it can be VERY taxing and exhausting, and there are many kids who are downright bratty and insufferable. But the latter point is often the fault of the adult(s) in their lives, and to ascribe this feeling of genuine hatred and disdain toward the entirety of a literal protected class - a defenseless and dependent one at that - is very sinister to me and is indicative of either deep unresolved issues from one's own childhood or sociopathic tendencies.

174rx2t,"CMV: If your child is going to be permanently disabled, it is selfish to have it","
I’ve noticed several posts on social media lately about parents with disabled children. These children have significant disabilities and will essentially require care throughout their lives.

Most of these posts present the situation from the parents' perspective. They often mention that they were aware their child would have a disability, but they didn't see it as a limitation. They express their commitment to provide their child with as much love and care as necessary to enable a life as normal as possible.

However, these posts rarely discuss the child’s perspective. Having experienced chronic illness myself and spoken to others in similar situations, I understand that while life may be challenging for the average individual, it's exponentially tougher for someone chronically ill. It's a continuous emotional and financial burden. There's a profound quote by Confucius that encapsulates this sentiment:

""A healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one.""

If you're considering having children but know they will be born with a disability, please consider other options. Adoption or pursuing methods to ensure your child's health are viable choices.",DopyDope02,1895,0.8199999928474426,980,1696961564,2023-10-10 13:12:44,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174rx2t/cmv_if_your_child_is_going_to_be_permanently/,10,2023
17daxlg,CMV: The Confederate Flag is traitorous.,"I went to Franklin Tennesse (my first time in the ""South"") for 2 days and was surprised by the amount of Confederate flags I saw there. These people are the very people who consider themselves patriots committed to our nation, yet I see the Confederate flag as the biggest symbol of treason in American history. It is a symbol of secession and oppression of American citizens. The Confederacy was literally a group of traitorous Americans who opposed our great Constitution and wanted to separate themselves from the United States. It is also a symbol of defending slavery, but that's a whole other discussion. I have nothing but the utmost respect for our country and its Constitution, and see the Confederate flag as a symbol of direct opposition to these institutions. Man say the flag is a symbol of Southern heritage and identity. Shouldn't the beautiful stars and stripes of the American flag be a symbol of their heritage and identity? I just find it peculiar NO OTHER REGION in the US is committed to a symbol of their ""regional identity"" like the South is. I live in California, but nobody is saying ""fuck yeah we're the bear state!"" NOBODY! We don't particularly emphasize our state flag here, and I don't think any other region is like that either, whether it be the Midwest, Pacific Coast, New England, or the Middle Atlantic.

A point I'd like to bring up is why immigrants who display the flags of their mother country is not treasonous in comparison. The South has strong regional ties to the US. Many immigrants have strong regional ties to their home countries. Additionally, their flags (even the flags of Vietnam and Iran) are not inherently symbols of anti-Americanism, while the Confederate flag literally is.",RealFee1405,1826,0.8100000023841858,1935,1697918170,2023-10-21 14:56:10,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17daxlg/cmv_the_confederate_flag_is_traitorous/,10,2023
173bl6u,"CMV: If there is a God, it's unfair for Him to sentence unbelievers to Hell as punishment when there are 4,000 religions in the world and it's impossible for someone to discern which one is correct.","Disclaimer: I'm only familiar with Christianity, and have some vague understanding of the other two Abrahamic religions (Islam and Judaism.) I know almost nothing about any other religion. So I cannot give adequate coverage of the other religions, all the more so given that 4,000 religions exist. I can only paint with a broad brush.

One central teaching of Christianity is that those who die unsaved will be suffer in Hell as their rightful outcome for not believing in Jesus as Lord and Savior. (Now, of course, many Christian denominations have different interpretations, but that's the overall gist of it.) 

And one argument that many Christians use is, ""God has made His existence clear and obvious to all, along with salvation, so we have no excuse on the day of Judgment.""

Indeed, a Bible verse, Romans 1:20, even says that explicitly: ""People are **without excuse** (for not believing in and knowing God.)""

Islam says similar things; that hell awaits the unbelievers.

The problem with all this, of course, is that 1) even if God exists, His existence is not obvious at all - the very fact that mankind has been debating His existence for millennia proves that it's not obvious - and 2) there are thousands of religions in the world. How are we supposed to know which one is correct?

To add a third point, **what religion one believes in is heavily influenced by geography and one's local culture.** If you were born in Iraq, you're almost certainly going to be a Muslim; if you were born in the Bible Belt in the USA, chances are you'll be a Christian, if you were born in Thailand, you'll likely be Buddhist, if you were born in India, you'll likely be Hindu, etc. So how is someone who was born in Iraq supposed to correctly ""deduce"" that Jesus is the one true Lord any more than someone born in Oklahoma or Alabama is supposed to think that Allah is god?

So the viewpoint I would be open to being changed is this: T**here isn't sufficient evidence for any one religion - out of 4,000 - to clearly and obviously stand out as the correct one - if religion is even the correct way to go at all (how do we know atheism isn't the right path?) And as such, it is unfair for God to throw someone into Hell for not drawing the correct religion-lottery number - correctly choosing the one out of 4,000.**

17kkff5,CMV: men should offer women their number instead of asking them for theirs.,"So in our current society we have a few gender norms that are pretty dumb and downright destructive. One of those is that men are supposed to chase and be active while dating. Women on the otherhand are reactive. Pretty much everyone would benefit if we got rid of this dynamic. 

A common issue men face is that women often times give out their number when asked, even if they aren’t actually interested. That means they either never text back or they only text back to be polite. And men are often seen as overly aggressive if they keep texting. 

So here’s my solution; When you approach a woman and want to get to know her, don’t ask her for her number. Offer her your own. That way, she has more agency and it avoids weird situations. If she does text, it’s clear that she’s interested. No games. No weird chasing. Should become the norm honestly. 
Its also in line with empowerment for women. Have them decide whether or not they want to keep contact.",Mr_McFeelie,1634,0.8500000238418579,1478,1698757068,2023-10-31 07:57:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17kkff5/cmv_men_should_offer_women_their_number_instead/,10,2023

17dzdxk,CMV: It's not unreasonable to expect people who get cold easy to accommodate people who get hot easy,"So, there's this age-old battle between people who run cold and people who run hot. It sucks for anyone to be at an uncomfortable temperature, but, logically, it's the people who run hot who should be accommodated.

The options for improving comfort are very limited when you're overheated. A fan can help, but only so far, and there's only so much clothing you can remove before you're making a scene. 

On the other hand, people who are cold can bundle up. They can wear heavier clothes, put on a sweater, or even run a small space heater. 

There's also more health risk for the hot person. Feeling overheated triggers sweating, which can cause rashes and dehydration. Unless it's ridiculously cold, being cold isn't the same kind of health risk.

So, for these reasons, I believe a person who runs hot should be the one accommodated. I believe if you're someone who runs cold and you insist on being accommodated at the discomfort of a warmer person, you're inconsiderate and illogical.",Zogonzo,1496,0.8500000238418579,1316,1697998150,2023-10-22 13:09:10,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17dzdxk/cmv_its_not_unreasonable_to_expect_people_who_get/,10,2023
17c4l2c,CMV: There's nothing political about young men who can't get laid,"You may think that the title of this post sounds a bit strange.  Let me explain. 

  
If you have ever read anything over at r/purplepilldebate, you’ll know that a lot of the young men posting there are complaining that they can’t find a girlfriend because, in their view, women make illogical and unjust decisions when choosing a romantic partner. This may or may not be true but I want to point out that I feel for these guys.  I was an “incel” myself back in the late 1990s before that term was coined and I was super frustrated.  But if think what’s going on here is that these young men are confusing their struggles to get laid with other past struggles against injustice that were more political in nature. 

  
Let’s take the civil rights struggle of African Americans or women’s lib or mainstream acceptance of LGTBQA.  In each case there were policy decisions that could be made to right the wrong: ending Jim Crow, removing barriers from women entering the workplace, legalizing same-sex marriages, etc.  And there were also efforts that could be made to change people’s attitudes about these oppressed groups: calling out cops for profiling black men, addressing rampant sexual harassment, not using homosexual pejoratives, etc. 

  
But in the case of young heterosexual men who can’t find a partner, there’s nothing to be done at the societal level.  Choosing a sexual partner is a highly subjective personal decision.  There’s nothing logical or fair about it.  Yes, people do sometimes choose horrible partners.  This is not a man thing or a woman thing or a gay thing or a straight thing.  It’s a human thing.  This is why there’s about 2000 years of poetry and music about heartache and loss. It’s a fundamental part of being a person.

    
And you can’t tell women that they must choose men who are under 5’7” because it’s not fair that they have a harder time dating anymore than you can tell a man that he has to date a woman who is 400 pounds.  It’s a person isn’t attracted to someone there’s really nothing to be done about it.    
Many will say, “but in the past men had a much easier time finding partners, and then feminists wrecked everything!”, or something like that.  This is nonsense.  Again, there’s nothing political about how dating works.  

  
American men are having a harder time dating these days because we live in a super affluent society with a mega abundance of choice.  This means that yes, if you use dating apps, women are going to be more picky because they can be.  Biological women, particularly in their early adulthood, have a lower sex drive than biological men.  If you put a bunch of photos of men in front of them, they are going to choose less of them to date than if you put a bunch of photos of women in front of men.  Sorry.  That’s just how it is. 

  
But technology is stacked against young men dating in other ways too.  Because of the internet, lots of horny young males spend hours and hours looking at porn or playing video games instead of going out and meeting people which would, you know, increase their chances of getting laid.  But that takes effort and it’s a little bit scary so it’s not hard to understand why so many are choosing instead to just stay home and masturbate.  

  
I really think it’s just that simple.  I feel kinda sorry for these guys but I don’t think there’s anything to be done about their plight at the societal level.  Anyone want to change my view?

17fq952,CMV: Too much racial awareness makes racism worse.,"There seems to be an ever increasing focus on inequities stemming from race and systemic racism. And the focus seems to be ever louder and ever present.

But I had a realization recently. I think it passed some kind of a tipping point at some time. Somewhere along the way, race has moved too far into the forefront of my consciousness. It's gotten to a level where a persons race dominates my awareness throughout an interaction. It's become too much of a focus, when of course there is so much more to a person than some amalgamated racial milieu of experiences based on the color of their skin.

I think some people would look at this and say that's the point. But I just want to go back to seeing people as people, and let the racial awareness become secondary.

176cb77,CMV: CEOs are not special talents that deserve tens of millions,"I was reading another thread that made some pretty good points about a CEOs value, but they only barely seem to hold up due to circumstance, and I hope there's more to it.

People wrote that top CEOs are tireless workers, who dedicate their entire life to the success of an entity. That may be true, but tons of regular people do this. One huge example are the millions of poor families that have individuals who sacrifice most of their waking hours to ensure some quality of life for their dependents. This behavior is not even minimally unique to top CEOs. Furthermore, executive positions rarely have any meaningful personal financial stakes, or otherwise (they already made it). The main reason for their absurd pay, appears to be because they are allowed to dictate it, and that societies prioritize shareholders over laborers. If laborers were protected and prioritized, it would be seemingly impossible to justify an absurd CEO salary.

I have also read that CEOs successfully manage tons of important relationships, and have to make enormous decisions every day. This is also not unique to top CEOs. Again, I will use a common example with higher personal stakes, which are working poor families. The working poor often have to succesfully deal with tons of people who have power over THEM (often sociopaths), under the threat of homelessness, daily. Their decisions and sacrifices are what make every difference for them and their families. CEOs have entire teams dedicated to making their decisions easier. The important relationships that CEOs manage are likely people with mutual interests, from the same absurd social class (low personal stakes in terms of financial security), which is hardly the most testing thing one can imagine.

Another thing I read is that CEOs tie together a lot of expertise from different departments. This is also not unique and even less special, in light of the people who manage the actual products and projects that truly define the success of a large company. In a large company, the departments must surely be connected by much more than an individual. A large successful company always looks more likely to succeed in spite of an owner, or CEO (Twitter), than it is to be helped in any way that isn't hollow, or related to perceptions. The stock market is seemingly ruled in large part by perception, and the directive is already built in, which is to make more money and cut costs. The CEO would be the friendly face that they know, and who makes the investors feel better. Someone who will pull the trigger on those nasty directives, and look good doing it, but not much more. If that's most of it, how does the position deserve 400 percent more than anybody?

I feel like the only reason this absurdity thrives, is the stock market. A market which is largely incoherent, needing regulation, and way too big to fail. The modern CEO seems to be the clown steward of our system's broken promises, and a vestige of our monotheistic worldview, but not some special genius.

I would love to know of any reason that a CEOs vast inequality makes sense, outside of a greedy/emotional stock market, and the directive for infinite growth that apparently needs a friendly/confident face to execute it. They really do seem to me to just be a bad person, that can market themselves as a good person, and push some dark directives, while only concerning themselves with initiatives that support those directives. It would be nice not to feel that shitty about all of it.

Another example that was used in the other thread was Messi, the soccer player, getting paid much more than others. But Messi represents labor and the object of consumption, not administration, so that doesn't work.",bohrmachine,1236,0.8299999833106995,701,1697131293,2023-10-12 12:21:33,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176cb77/cmv_ceos_are_not_special_talents_that_deserve/,10,2023

It's making the movement come off as ideological instead of rational as well as ambivalent to human suffering, not unlike the ways in which Israel has been ideological and ambivalent to the suffering of Palestinians. I think, to most people, the very true fact that Israel's treatment of Palestine *explains* the situation is simply not enough to *justify* the deaths of civilians, and that disconnect is hurting the reputation of the free Palestine movement. Hamas has damaged the reputation of Palestine by targeting civilians, and supporters of a free Palestine would rally far more support if they'd communicate, directly and without concession, the fact that the actions of Hamas were morally reprehensible, without concluding that they were ""necessary"" or, in so many words, that ""Israel had it coming."" Unless the majority of Pro-Palestine individuals *are* indeed Pro-Hamas (which I don't want to just assume flippantly because I have no way of knowing whether or not that's true) I don't understand why more people don't condemn Hamas explicitly instead of responding to the attack on Gaza with Pro-Palestine sentiments.

2. No, you aren’t oppressed. You made the choices to eat the amount of food you did to get to your size. If you don’t fit in a plane seat, or don’t meet the weight requirements for an activity, no one is required to accommodate you. You get to deal with the consequences.
3. Genetics don’t play that big of a role. Even with PCOS and Endometriosis, it is still possible to lose weight in a healthy way.
4. Calorie counting and a deficit does not mean an eating disorder. There is a safe and PROVEN way to lose weight, a calorie deficit, eating less (while still eating enough, not starving yourself)

Weight loss is completely possible and simple. It may not be easy as it takes will power, but it is possible.

17d53a0,CMV: People who don’t have kids will be worse off in old age,"I currently work in a nursing home and have some hospital experience from school and ever since I started this past year I’ve never  really realized how much older people without families struggle. 

Many older people develop serious health conditions and once you’re a senior if you don’t have a family of your own it’s a struggle. Most people in this group either have pets which obviously can’t take care of them or a group of friends, neighbours or extended family who is also old.  

At the nursing home I work with many patients without families are just rotting away here until they die, they don’t get adequate care and without family members these people often get poor treatment for years and have their health conditions exacerbated. It’s really just a cruel lonely existence, I actually feel better for patients with dementia because at least they aren’t aware of the state they are in. 

On top of this many patients in that group always tell me about how lonely they have gotten and their biggest regret often being not starting a family because after a certain point most social contacts lose touch or pass away.

172d6zf,CMV: The Israelis - and most people - would behave just like the Palestinians if they were in their shoes.,"The whole Israel-Palestine issue could fill 400 pages; it's one of the thorniest and most complicated political-religious-historical issues in the world. I am not going to pretend that my 400-word post here can do it justice, and I'll preface by saying that anything I post here is, out of necessity, going to have to be gross oversimplification:

 The Israelis frequently condemn the Palestinian side (such as the current ongoing Hamas attack) for terrorist attacks and whatnot - unsurprisingly so, given that Israel is their side (just like how America, of course, condemned the 9/11 attacks.) **But I am not convinced that, if the roles were reversed, that the Israelis would be behaving any differently.**

Say that Israel were squelched and prevented from being a formally-recognized nation state on terms that it wanted (yes, the Palestinians have been offered two-state solutions, but none that they found satisfactory), and also that it was facing continuous blockade, in poverty, were under the control of a much bigger, stronger, richer opponent of the opposing religion, and that this went on for decades with no end in sight. 

I don't believe, for one moment, that the Israelis would say ""Well, we'll just be content and stay like this forever and always pursue peaceful solutions even though we've found that peace gets us nothing."" The Israelis would be doing something just like what Gaza Hamas is doing right now. **And in fact, that's similar to what Israel did, in fact, do. The Lehi (Stern Gang) used terrorist attacks to help get the nation of Israel formed in the first place, back in the 1940s.**

17du96r,CMV: Paternity tests should be done on every baby by default,"Just saw a post on r/relationship_advice where the mother gave birth to a baby that looked nothing like her husband, refused to give him a paternity test because it was ""humiliating"" AND also revealed that she had recently refused to end a (pretty weird) friendship with a coworker that her husband was uncomfortable with. She then proceeds to be all ""Surprised Pikachu-faced"" when he thinks she cheated on him with said coworker, refuses to help with the baby, and him and his family start treating her badly. (he continued to help with their 2 other kids as normal, though)

In the end, the mother FINALLY gets that paternity test, proving once and for all that the kid was indeed his, and once she does, the father gets ALL OVER his daughter, hugging and giving her all his love, as I'm sure he would have done from the very begining, had she just gotten that damn test done sooner.

Some of the points that resonate with me the most on this issue are:

* It still baffles me that this test isn't standard procedure, especially when we already draw blood from newborns and screen them for a whole slew of diseases upon delivery. Surely it wouldn't be too hard to add a simple paternity test to the list!
* I know there's an implication of mistrust that comes with asking your partner for a paternity test, but if it became standard procedure - in other words, a test that the hospital does ""automatically"", with no need for parental input - that would completely remove that implication from play. It would become a non-issue.
* Having a kid is a life-changing event, and it scares me to no end to know that I could be forced into ""one-eightying"" my life over a baby I actually played no part in making.
* Knowing your family's medical history, from both sides, is extremely important.

17a6q26,CMV: There's nothing wrong with criticizing Islam,"My view concerns Islam specifically, because nobody seems to take issue with me criticizing any other religion. 

Islam is no better or worse than other religions and like other religions there is plenty that warrants criticism. Like the fact that several passages of the holy book either promote violence or have not been written clearly enough to stop people from interpreting them that way. 

But whenever somebody criticizes Islam today they're often accused of being Islamaphobic. Which is really, from the perspective of those who don't follow Islam just not liking the views of people who have been dead for centuries, which seems completely fine to me and not remotely racist unless somebody dislikes them because they were from the middle east. But the assumption is usually ""this person doesn't like POC."" 

Some people seem to believe that criticizing Islam will lead to hate towards Muslims, esp. Since they're already in the minority. I think the opposite is true- if you refuse to point out clear issues with a given religion and don't let anybody else do it either people start looking for those who will. And the people that they find are the actual threat. Whereas if you say ""this passage about lot's people is encouraging violence against gay people or not written very well so it causes some hardcore followers of Islam to kill gay people... It's no different than saying this passage in the bible about slavery is bad.

16z86yq,"CMV: I'm extremely suspicious of anyone who opts to homeschool their kids, and really don't think there are many legitimate reasons to do it.","I have seen studies suggesting that home-schooled kids perform better in certain academic fields when compared to non-homeschooled kids. What I haven't seen is a study that indexes this to income, or to two-parent households. Both of those have profound impacts on the likelihood of academic success, and most homeschooling situations require either a very comfortable income, a two-parent household, or both. 

I'm highly doubtful that your average homeschooled child is performing significantly better than if they were in a regular school with parents who took an active interest in their education. 

Meanwhile, I have serious trouble grappling with the impact that this level of isolation and enmeshment might have. I can't help but feel, based on the homeschooling situations I've seen that it leaves kids less fulfilled or socially mature. 

The majority of homeschooling I've seen has been for religious reasons. Now, I attended 13 years of faith-based education. I'm not *entirely* against integrating religious instruction into education on principle, provided it doesn't impede on a child's understanding of basic facts. I *mostly* am, but given it's long history and integration with many education systems I'm more comfortable. 

However, I find it ***especially*** suspicious when your faith leads to that degree of isolation and inordinate levels of control over your child.

17810uj,"CMV: ""It wasn't real communism"" is a fair stance","We all know exactly what I am talking about. In virtually any discussion about communism or socialism, those defending communism will hit you with the classic ""not real communism"" defense. 

**While I myself am opposed to communism,** I do think that this argument is valid.

It is simply true that none of the societies which labelled themselves as communist ever achieved a society which was classless, stateless, and free of currency. Most didn't even achieve socialism (which we can generally define as the workers controlling the means of production).

I acknowledge that the meaning of words change over time, but I don't see how this applies here, as communism was defined by theory, not observance, so it doesn't follow that observance would change theory. 

It's as if I said: Here is the blueprint for my ultimate dreamhouse, and then I tried to build my dreamhouse with my bare hands and a singular hammer which resulted in an outcome that was not my ultimate dreamhouse. 

You wouldn't look at my blueprint and critique it based on my poor attempt, you would simply criticize my poor attempt.

I think this distinction is very important, because people stand to gain from having a well-rounded understanding of history, human behavior, and politics. And because I think that Marx's philosophy and method of critical analysis was valuable and extremely detailed, and this gets overlooked because people associate him with things that were not in line with his views.

Why?  What age range is it ok then? 

In a world where we beg to “let kids be kids” why is a 14 even 17 year old not yet adult is given grief when dressing up, enjoying the outdoors, spending time with friends or family or even alone and getting free candy? 

Isn’t this better than many other possibly delinquent activities they could be doing? Is it too naïve to think that kids who are out causing trouble might be less inclined to smash pumpkins if they didn’t feel it was “uncool” to trick-or-treat and felt more welcomed to participate?

Some kids that appear old as well may just look older, may be developmentally delayed, may not have other friends or family to hang out with that night and this is an activity they can participate in and enjoy but then they hear “you look a little old….”

17925sm,"CMV: If Palestine was ""free"" it would be a ethno-fascist hellscape, and a single-state solution is only marginally better","When you ask, fundamentally, what the hordes of people in the west protesting against Israel really want for the region,  most will, when pressed, eventually acknowledge they dont actually want their public demand of a two state solution along 1967 borders with land swaps.   This is actually pretty explicit from the ubiquitous protest chant ""From the River \[Jordan\] to the Sea \[Med\], Palestine must be free"", which clearly requires the conception of Israel to cease to be.

So what they are really arguing for is a single state solution.    Let's be incredibly generous and give them the benefit of the doubt and suggest that the single state is created without genocide, and protects both Jews and Muslims (and Christians, Atheists, even, gasp, apostates) equally.   What happens? 

Well, since the 650-700k Palestinians left their homes in what was the Mandate of Palestine (at least partly at the urging of the Arab state neighbours massing troops on the borders in anticipation of invasion), a lot of time has past and now there's upwards of 6m+ refugees and their descendants (fun fact, when counting Palestinian refugees for official purposes only patrilineal descendants count- score 1 for the patriarchy!  Possibly a further 2-3m more people can claim descendance from Palestinian refugee antecedents).

Assuming a decent proportion of this number exercised a right to return or a right to citizenship, combined with existing populations in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israeli Muslims, would give the new unitary Levant state a significant Muslim majority.

But what would that population be like?   Well, polling of Palestinian refugees is pretty clear on what they would vote for - hardline Islamists, most likely full jihadis.   The charter of Hamas (approval rate: 60%) expressly calls for driving the Jews into the sea, and half of Gazans actively support this goal.  Several more extreme groups have higher approval rates (Lion's Den: 75%)

In a two state solution, its obvious that the Palestinian state would elect a government extremely hostile to their Jewish neighbour.  Anyone who says different is deluded; their argument usually goes ""Palestinian hostility to Israel is Israels fault - if the occupation ended they'd have no reason to continue to be hostile"".   This ignores how Jews are treated in the world's Muslim majority states. Try being an apostate or Jew in Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.   Even Turkey.   It's hard to imagine a Palestinian state, whose population would be in large less educated, more hardline, poorer and more religious than those of any of those states, would somehow fulfil the progressive wet dreams of the pro-palestine protesters.  Much more likely any Palestinian state would be fun by violent religious extremists that make the Taliban look liberal.   Women would not be educated,  Polygamy (which is legal in Gaza) and corporal punishment would be commonplace. Apostasy would be punished by death (as it is expressly in 9 other Muslim majority states).   Borders with Israel would need to remain locked down to avoid constant violent clashes.  Travel between Gaza and the West Bank would have to remain extremely tightly proscribed (unless someone builds a tunnel!)

In a single state solution, you import all these problems into a state which needs to represent the interests of two utterly dissimilar populations.   It's hard to imagine how this would work, perhaps some kind of strictly enforced apportioned (but not proportionate) representation, constitutional safeguards with supermajority requirements etc..  Even then, it's likely there would be distinct local government (perhaps a federated republic?) of different Jewish and Palestinian areas of the state, and this is where things would get sticky.    Would the federal state be able to mandate Israeli-style anti discrimination laws, e.g. based on gender,  or for example outlawing Polygamy, when this is a normal part of life for many Palestinians?   How would Shariah law, which Palestinians are governed by, interact with this Federal law?   

Ultimately as Palestinians who have emigrated return en masse and (due also to much higher birth rates), the small Muslim majority in the unitary state would become an overwhelming one.  Constitutional safeguards are suddenly increasingly under threat and federal politics will remain deadlocked between two totally mis-aligned factions.  Pressure to take from the wealthy former-Israelis and give to the poor former-Palestinians would be overwhelming.  Public conflict between sectarian groups would be inevitable.   Under these conditions, its hard to imagine the state's safeguards remaining intact.  Likely, civil society would break down.

There are no easy answers, but I've yet to hear a cohesive vision from anyone that sounds like something any Israeli should support, even if they also want (rightly!) an end to all illegal settlement in the West Bank and the deplorable conditions in Gaza.",FFIFISISHFISHFISH,912,0.6499999761581421,1456,1697449227,2023-10-16 04:40:27,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17925sm/cmv_if_palestine_was_free_it_would_be_a/,10,2023
16y3qhp,"CMV: Conservatives decide which viewpoint to hold on an issue by first checking to see which stance liberals are holding, and then automatically opposing it.","This sort of viewpoint is impossible to prove, given that there are no surveys or polling on the issue (and even if there were, there's no way to get people to respond honestly,) so it's simply my hunch, and I'm open to people changing my mind on it.

There are many issues in politics today - particularly Ukraine and Covid - on which it's pretty clear that the only, or main, reason that conservatives are opposing Thing XYZ is simply because they see liberals supporting Thing XYZ.

Let's use Covid first. At the beginning of the Covid pandemic, many conservatives actually went along with the pandemic protocols, and America actually saw a brief dip in infections (this is around the March 2020 time.) That's because Covid hadn't become ""politically sorted out yet."" 

But as time went on, and mask-wearing and social distancing became seen as a ""liberal"" thing to do, conservatives thought, ""Okay, now that libs are doing it, we have to start opposing it, otherwise we wouldn't be conservatives"" and so they started opposing vaccines, masks, distancing - for no good reason other than that libs were doing it and they felt ""If Team Blue does it, then Team Red must oppose it."" There was no **inherent** reason why conservatives should assist a virus' spread and see America suffer heavy death tolls, other than that the libs were fighting against the virus. 

Same with Ukraine. Republican support for Ukraine was actually quite strong at first, around March 2022. But as time went on, and supporting Ukraine became seen as a ""Democratic"" thing to do, conservatives began opposing it. Bear in mind, again, that there's no **inherent** reason why conservatives should oppose helping Ukraine - not only was the cost of doing so extremely cheap, but historically, opposing Russia has been the Republican stance - just look at Ronald Reagan, the ""The-Soviet-Union-is-an-Evil-Empire"" president. So, again, with Ukraine, it was a case of conservatives watching liberals supporting Ukraine and thinking, ""Hmmm, if they support it, we must oppose it.""

I'd even go so far as to say that **if liberals had opposed Covid anti-virus measures and opposed helping Ukraine, that conservatives would then, reflexively, have supported those anti-virus measures and supported Ukraine - out of sheer opposition to Team Blue.**

So, that's the stance I am trying to get changed - that many (but not all) conservatives today, especially the Marjorie Taylor-Greene type, are not basing their stance off of any true principle or pillar of reason, but rather, simply because they automatically oppose whatever Team Blue supports - even if Team Blue is supporting something that's **good**.

17ghhot,CMV: Racial tribalism is bad.,"I am Asian American. I am wholly Asian and wholly American, yet I interact with people from various different cultural, religious, ethnic, racial, and national backgrounds on a daily basis. Racial tribalism would be the exact opposite, sticking to one's own racial or cultural group and interacting with people from other racial or cultural groups as minimally as possible, or not at all. As an Asian American, I think my racial group (at least where I live in San Diego) is well integrated with the rest of American society and have friends of many different races or cultural backgrounds. However, it pisses me off that many younger Asian Americans also often defend racial tribalism (which I've witnessed frequently), just because their parents did it despite the fact they don't really engage in racial tribalism themselves. Racial tribalism harms society and us individually, and I'll delve into both here:

Firstly, racial tribalism is a severe impediment to social cohesion. If we try to interact with each other as little as possible, how can we cooperate, innovate, or progress? We become unable to address and fix problems together as a society because of our balkanization. The only way to get shit done is to unite. It also certainly leads to ""othering"" and stereotypes, which are the first steps towards full blown racism. What is especially hypocritical is that the same Asian Americans who defend racial tribalism also complain when we get stereotyped or people are uneducated about our culture. The Nazis and imperial Japanese were racial tirbalists, though of course at a scale not present today. But of course, they didn't start out at that scale either... We become ignorant of the other side, which is especially said to see as I love engaging with and interacting with different cultures. It is very enriching and you learn a lot.

Additionally, it can inhibit us individually. When we (I don't mean specifically Asians, I mean ""we"" just as a pronoun) ""other"" other races, then they will ""other"" us back. This can negatively impact people emotionally. Also, when we interact with as many people as possible regardless of race, our social networking and opportunities increase as a result.

Of course this isn't to mean people can't want to spend time with people of a similar culture, but they should feel comfortable interacting with a larger multiracial society as a whole. I can understand how many groups such as the Chinese, Blacks, Italians, Irish, Jews, Mexicans, Japanese, Arabs, etc were forced to tribalize in the past (in American history), but now is a different time and America is the greatest melting pot in the world and we should not take it for granted.",RealFee1405,771,0.8299999833106995,525,1698273978,2023-10-25 17:46:18,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ghhot/cmv_racial_tribalism_is_bad/,10,2023

These babies would not have survived being born at home and some moms either. I’ve also known 3 people who attempted home births and all three ended up in emergency medical transfers. 
I know several paramedic friends who are all against home births. They have seen too many horror stories of things going wrong. Midwives treat paramedics like they are magical angels, but they are still bound by distance and time and the reality is they just can’t get to you or to the hospital fast enough. Also I recently called 911 for a medical emergency and was out on hold before speaking to them - on hold before even being triaged. I have zero faith that if I needed emergency care I would actually get it. 
Home birth has zero benefit to the baby. It is not healthier or safer in North America to give birth at home. It is only because mom wants the comfort of her own home. It doesn’t do anything to benefit baby it only puts baby ( and mom) at increase risks.

If, for instance, a state had a natural disaster, a politician might soon after suggest that it could have been handled better if we made certain reforms. After they do so however, you're likely to see a lot of people (including other politicians) call them out for ""politicizing a tragedy""

Ideally, politicians SHOULD be doing things to try and prevent further tragedies, so it makes sense to learn from the ones that have happened and to use them to make a point. Thats a part of their job of trying to make good decisions for society and represent people. Are they trying to get points politically from doing so? Probably, though in most cases I doubt it's their only reason. But whatever, their trying to earn political points on a constant basis, and there are far more immoral ways of doing so than simply using a tragedy to illustrate highlight a good or bad policy suggestion. To be clear, your free to disagree and strongly critique whatever it is they suggest, that's not my issue. My issue is that, in my opinion, getting mad at someone for making a suggestion after a tragedy Soley on the grounds that their somehow using the tragedy is silly.",Meepmeepbeepbeep666,737,0.8799999952316284,197,1698435803,2023-10-27 14:43:23,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17hvq2p/cmv_dont_politicize_a_tragedy_is_the_weakest_line/,10,2023
17blkjq,"CMV: Reddit should display both downvotes and upvotes on comments and posts, or at least the ration","Why is it that the way reddit currently displays comment scores shows only the net score (upvotes - downvotes)? This creates an unhealthy hivemind mentality where people pile on downvotes once a comment already has a negative score.  
Shouldn't it display both?  
Seeing only the net score makes a -100 comment look like everyone disagrees, even though the real counts could be 11,000 upvotes and 11,100 downvotes. That's still a very mixed opinion overall!  
Only showing net scores makes people scared to share minority opinions, since they'll assume no one agrees if the visible score is negative. This strengthens echo chambers and discourages healthy debate.Reddit should show both upvote and downvote counts, or at least show the ratio of upvote %.  
That would give a much more nuanced look at public opinion.For example, a score of -20 with a ratio of 45% would indicate a very divisive comment that some agree with. But the way it looks now, -20 appears like overwhelming disagreement.  
Showing both numbers would lead to less pile-on downvoting and more reasoned discussion. People would be more willing to express minority opinions knowing others agree. And seeing the upvote count might make some reconsider a downvote.Reddit already tracks both numbers internally.  
Making them visible would be an easy change to reduce hivemind mentality and echo chambers. The resulting discussions would be more representative of variety in public opinion, not just the majority viewpoint.

16zufx8,"CMV: Pretty much everyone online claiming to be ""plural"" is bsing.","So I'm a little bit older than most of y'all, I'm a dad in his late 40s. I didn't know what being ""plural"" or ""a system"" meant until very recently. For those who are unaware, it is a term that young people are using basically to say that they have multiple personalities. This is... a very rare type of condition, and a very serious one, usually tied to severe abuse, so after an ongoing drama with my oldest child (late teens) involving similar claims, I became extremely alarmed and really tried to do my research on this one. 

I read from a great many sources on the internet, I went through through a lot of Twitter threads, I joined several Discord servers and said I was there to learn more, I read conversations, I talked to many of these people, and ultimately I have come to the conclusion that literally all of them are, at absolute best, greatly exaggerating their symptoms. At worst they're lying for clout or for some other unknown selfish reason.

Now I want to be very clear that I am not saying that these kinds of disorders don't exist. I am well aware that they do. I have a sister with schizophrenia, and I know how serious and crazy mental illness is. I am also not claiming that the people doing this are perfectly mentally healthy, they're not. I am not trying to discriminate or be hateful.

At this point, though, I am beyond convinced that basically all of people are faking their disorder. Many of them list ""disorders"" that don't exist in their twitter bio, and if you watch any videos on YouTube or TikTok (which I unfortunately did) of them, their behavior is incredibly obviously faked. Nobody is having this kind of fun with a serious mental illness. In my opinion this almost feels beyond debate- nobody is parading their severe mental problems around like this. 

However, my wife doesn't agree with me. She thinks that these people are just learning to express themselves, and feel more comfortable ""presenting as multiple people"" and that my view is ""mean."" To me this sounds overly generous, and like it is making a mockery of serious mental problems. That aside, I trust my wife very much, and so I am coming here to hopefully get some kind of middle ground perspective, from people closer in age to those who I am observing.",Lelelelelefart,618,0.8600000143051147,277,1696443404,2023-10-04 13:16:44,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16zufx8/cmv_pretty_much_everyone_online_claiming_to_be/,10,2023

It's not that I disagree with the idea that some groups as a whole have more power and influence than other groups. I absolutely do, and I don't think this should be the case. I just don't think this information is remotely useful when it comes to policy. Because the problem you run into is while the group *collectively* has more power, most *individuals* lack any sort of meaningful power. 

So when a policy is proposed that disempowers the oppressor group the individuals at the top who are actually doing almost all of the oppressing are not affected, but rather the people at the bottom who are already lacking power to oppress anybody. So basically people who were already powerless to change anything are losing power they cannot afford to lose. That hardly seems like something to celebrate.

174rns9,CMV: Exercise ought to be encouraged to the same extent that personal hygiene is.,"Personal hygiene is something almost all of us are taught from a young age- things like brushing your teeth, washing your hair, taking showers, trimming nails, etc. We encourage these behaviors not only because of aesthetic and social benefits (i.e. smell better, look cleaner, so on) but also because they play a huge preventative role against diseases and deterioration of our bodies. If we stopped brushing our teeth, we would likely develop plaque or gum disease. If we stopped showering, we would begin to stink and accumulate dirt, grime, and bacteria on our bodies. 

As a society, we tend to encourage these behaviors fairly regularly, and often shun those who avoid these behaviors, and while I’m not trying to encourage bullying, I think this type of social correction is important to keep people clean and healthy.

However when it comes to exercise, the attitude seems to be a lot more focused on doing what you feel like as an individual; if you want to work out that’s cool but it’s totally acceptable if you don’t. This is the point I think needs to be adjusted.

Exercise is just as critical for health and appearance as hygiene is, with a sedentary lifestyle being just as bad as smoking, if not worse, when it comes to increasing the risk factor for debilitating and chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancers, and even depression. It also has the secondary benefit of increasing confidence and making a person look nicer.

Now I don’t want to suggest that everyone should become a bodybuilder, or work out with the intention of being a skinny legend, but we as a society ought to encourage and promote exercise to the same extent as hygiene, if not more. There are so many types of physical activity, many of which are available at no cost other than a little time (30 minutes a day or every other day) and little to no cost. 

I feel like the carefree attitude many have with their bodies and physical fitness is harmful as it normalizes sedentary habits instead of encouraging everyone to be active in whatever way they can.",ifitisntconnor,533,0.9200000166893005,151,1696960919,2023-10-10 13:01:59,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174rns9/cmv_exercise_ought_to_be_encouraged_to_the_same/,10,2023

But, have you ever thought about the actual implications of a non-regulated market? Every single thing we sell is related in some way or another to resources of the planet. In FME, selling derivates of natural resources is just ""transforming"" nature in order to introduce our product in market's offer supply. If the right conditions are met, this will increase the demand of that product, wich in turn lets us invest in resource extraction. This will ultimately increase offer, and then an ""economic loop"" can start, powered only earth's resources and capitalist market  relations. One does not need a PHD in mathematics to see how easily this can turn the numbers into the depletion of the original resource, ultimately privating ALL humanity of its benefits. Saying this is an idealization of reality is far from the cold facts: we are constantly transforming _clean air_ into _pollution and factories_, _energy_ into _power and an increase in temperature_, _free land_ into _urbanization and population growth_...

179ey04,CMV: You shouldn’t go to Reddit for relationship advice,"I believe there are two good sources of relationship advice: close friends and trained couples counselors. Getting advice from a stranger with no qualifications, speaking based on a few paragraphs of text, is more likely to hurt than to help. 

About the qualifications, I think that even if a layman is in a healthy relationship, they are probably not aware of what makes the relationship healthy. It’s better to get advice from someone who can draw from the world’s collective, rigorously tested understanding of how relationships work, i.e. relationship science. 

Aside from professionals, close friends could be a good resource because they have intimate and extensive context about you and/or your partner. A brief description of your relationship gives nothing close to that understanding. Redditors are bound to make wrong assumptions about your relationship in addition to probably having wrong ideas about relationships in general.

Personally, my girlfriend [22F] and I [23M] have both used Reddit for advice about our relationship of almost two years. Neither of us has been in a relationship before. Every time I’ve posted people have told me that either I’m a bad person or she is, or that we’re just not compatible and should break up.

Without strong institutions in these two aspects, the state will soon lapse into dictatorships, authoritarianism and/or totalitarianism. I'm not an expert in either of these areas, so I'm happy to enlightened here, but these Capitalism vs Socialism arguments always seem strange to me.

This current so called “crisis” myth is also nothing new. There has always been a vocal segment of the US who blame immigrants for every single social challenge from the economy to drugs and crime. 

For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime.

I lived in a border community for 12years that had upwards of 80% Spanish speaking immigrants of every sort of legal status. They are no different than any other segment of the US.

The current “crisis” in the US is born of nothing less than thinly varnished bigotry.

Furthermore large segments of the US economy are utterly dependent on immigrant labor to perform work that Americans simply will not do. We’re we to actually enforce the current prohibitions we have on the books the results would be catastrophic.

17f6fkz,CMV: No one should support Palestine,"There's quite a bit of posts about the conflict but if you're here then you're interested!

Quick note: I am not saying we should not support PalestiNIANS (the people), what they're going through is a horrendous nightmare

Anyway, I want to quickly say what I think I know so that if I'm mistaken it can be pointed out:

- Israel took over most of the surrounding land including what some argue rightfully belong to Palestine, and that this was a long time ago
- This conflict has lasted years and several battles, with the current one being yet another fight for Palestine to take their land back
- However, Israel has tried around 5 times to come to a peaceful agreement (involving the UN at some point) about these lands which have been rejected by Palestine every time
- Lastly, the initiators of today's conflict are literal terrorists

Ok and this is why I hold my view:

- First of all, Palestine begun this conflict (again). Why is anyone supporting the perpetrator of a war that has already caused so much destruction and murder of innocent people
- Also, these were TERRORISTS!!! There's a group in my home country that are similar to Hamas, and if they ever pulled something like this I would never support my country... yet so many support this.
- Israel has had this land for a decently long time, why is Palestine still fighting for it? They're clearly militarily inferior and can't protect it, they should be taking a peace treaty at all costs
- I understand the implications of the land being controlled by Israel (Economic troubles and such) but does this really justify the killing of thousands of innocent people?
- Lastly, it seems Israel is launching a counterattack that to me seems to be fair, they keep getting attacked for the same thing so it's time to shut off Hamas for good. Hamas uses civilians to protect itself while Israel seems to just want to protect its people whatever the cost.

I understand that because of the recent border blockage many Palestenians do not have access to food which is very unjust and horrible to the innocent people, but this has been a common tactic to pressure governments to stop attacks and converse diplomatically or surrender.

That is all, I'm very open to having my view changed on this matter if I'm persuaded. And just in case this is brought up; I am not from either of these countries or their surrounding areas, and I'm also not originally from any of the countries are actively supporting either side, I hold this view purely out of the information I have provided.",Juanito2Gud,466,0.7799999713897705,1089,1698129525,2023-10-24 01:38:45,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17f6fkz/cmv_no_one_should_support_palestine/,10,2023

17bx7k4,CMV: Religious ethics have no place in policy making,"I reently had a discussion with a redditor right here in a post about critique towards islam. It quickly evolved in a discussian about ethics itself.

I hurled some secular ethical principles against him, and i am fairly sure, at the moment, that those are absolutly superior and more appliable towars almost every ethical problam that one can face, especially when deciding on laws and policies. 

I would go furhter and say i currently hold that believe that every law influenced by religion is inherently unjust towards the percentage of the population that does NOT hold the religious views that influenced that law. 

I personally get the impression that being religious is fine, and ordering your life according to religious rules is fine as long as those rules remain private and confined to your own life. Although i still believe that someone adhering to secular ethics because they WANT to be a good person seems like a better person to me (and safer) than someone only holding back on the mayhem because they are afraid of divine punishment (because there might be ways around drawing the deities ire, for example by targeting a group that is singled out as ""evil"" in a holy text)

172zudm,CMV: Voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all.,"In 2020, only about 2/3 of eligible voters actually voted. According to a survey, of the 1/3 who did not vote, 20% said their reason for not voting was that they did not like the candidates.  
https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/945031391/poll-despite-record-turnout-80-million-americans-didnt-vote-heres-why  
Here is my view: If you do not like either of the main two candidates enough to vote for one of them, you might as well vote for someone else.  
A lot of people say ""a vote for a 3rd party candidate is a vote for (insert name of Democrat or Republican candidate)""  
By definition it is not. It is a vote for someone else. And this argument fails even harder when the voter in question would not otherwise have voted for anyone.  
People say that voting for a 3rd party candidate is meaningless because they won't win. But something interesting happens when a 3rd party candidate gets 5% of the vote. They become eligible for federal funding in the next election.  
https://transition.fec.gov/info/chtwo.htm  
This is certainly not impossible. In 2016, both Clinton and Trump were such immensely terrible candidates that the Libertarian nominee, Gary Johnson, got 3.3% of the vote.  
It's too early to say for sure, but I'd wager both major candidates in 2020 will be astonishingly difficult to vote for.  
So if a potential voter's reaction to whichever two clowns they put at the top of the ballot is to vote for neither of them... why shouldn't they vote for someone else instead?  
This is not to say that an undecided voter should necessarily vote 3rd party instead of trying to figure out which of the major candidates is the 'lesser evil'. My statement is only that voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all.  
In an ironic twist, due to the way the electoral college works, in deep red or deep blue states, voting for a 3rd party candidate may influence the result of the election more profoundly than voting for one of the two main candidates. One vote can be the difference between a major party receiving 88% or 88.0001% of the vote in a particular state... or it can be the difference between a third party receiving 4.99999999% or 5% of the vote nationwide.",LaserWerewolf,433,0.7799999713897705,631,1696773607,2023-10-08 09:00:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/172zudm/cmv_voting_for_a_3rd_party_candidate_is_more/,10,2023
17idvo4,CMV: Muslims in the west will always prefer their co religionists to their host country,"Maybe this is controversial but this is something I’ve thought for a while. Whenever a tragedy happens in the Muslim world, or whenever Muslims are attacked or their religion is criticised, no matter where it is, Muslims in the west or elsewhere all come together. They band together and they defend one another. Be it in the current israel-Palestine conflict, the persecution of Muslims in China, Kashmir, or protesting sometimes violently over things like Charlie Hebedo Muhammad cartoons. And yet they never do the same when some tragedy hits their adopted country particularly in the west.

Take the UK for example. Muslims here remained silent when Pakistani grooming gangs raped and abused white women across the uk over the last fifty years. I’d they ever spoke about it, it was ti say how this was victimising them. Or in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing, or the stabbing of David Ames (an MP), or the London Bridge terrorist attack. Or the fact that a teacher in the UK had to go into hiding for discussion whether it was right to show a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad. Or when some Muslims  threatened with death a school boy who supposedly scuffed a Quran by accident t and they forced his mother to beg for forgiveness.

Or even recently when after the recent flare up in the ME, we e seen a 1450% increase in anti semitic crime. And yet they’ve usually just kept silent or said it’s to be expected.

They never come out and show any sympathy or horror when these things happen. Instead they often seem to show sympathy with those Muslims who commit these atrocities.

The comedy, action, cinematography, and characters were all spectacular. No action movie with such a large cast of characters has made them feel as unique and distinct from each other. The twist at the end was engaging too. The best part of this movie was that it didn't take itself too seriously. It felt fresh and unique from all the other action comedies I've watched in that it wasn't really complex. It didn't tell us much about the backgrounds of many characters and I wasn't really asking myself ""uh what does Ladybug's organization actually do"" because I was too engaged in the movie. FANTASTIC PERFORMACES. Brad Pitt delivered again, this time in a very funny way. Aaron Taylor Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Hiroyuki Sanada, and everyone else performed well again. The movie had a very unique aesthetic and I loved it. David Leitch is an amazing director, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every single one of his movies I've watched. 10/10 highly recommend, the best movie of the 2020s so far. Outclasses everything Marvel has put out in this decade, outclasses every boring ass drama, outclasses Everything Everywhere All at Once (did not deserve all those Oscars), and SURPASSES SHITTY JOY RIDE! Fuck that movie. Out of every single Asian move that came out this decade (Shang Chi, EEAO, Joy Ride, and Bullet Train), THE ONE STARRING THE WHITE GUY WAS THE BEST LMAO! (I'm Asian chill.)",RealFee1405,429,0.7900000214576721,165,1698709465,2023-10-30 18:44:25,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17k7b8h/cmv_bullet_train_is_criminally_underrated/,10,2023
179e0bf,"CMV: Israel over decades has shown its willingness give back land for peace. In turn, there cannot be peace until Palestinians accept that Israel isn't going anywhere and are willing to make compromises.","The Palestinians have been offered statehood multiple times and have rejected it everytime because the deal wasn't 100% to their liking. In 1948, they said no. In 1967 Israel offered all of the land it won in war back in exchange for peace, the answer from Arab countries was a resounding ""NO."" Then you have Arafat leading everyone on and then rejecting a reasonable peace offer from Israel.

Eventually you have to wonder if statehood is the goal or something else.

At a certain point, Palestinians will have to recognize that Israel isn't going anywhere and if their ultimate objective is statehood, there has to be some compromise. Israel gave back the entirety of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for peace, a wildly controversial and unpopular move at the time. 

When Israel left Gaza in 2005, it forcibly removed Israeli citizens to let Gazans govern themselves.

 When the goal is great (peace, or statehood), hard and tough decisions must be made. Compromise must be made. After WW2, the Germans lost parts of historic Germany. Like it or not, for peace to exist, when one party starts a war and then loses, they lose leverage and negotiating power and must make compromises if peace is truly the goal. It's been that way throughout history.

Palestinians need to let go of the notion that resistance means the eradication of Israel and that generations of refugees can return. It's simply a fairytale dream at this point. Too many Palestinians, in my opinion, have been brainwashed to believe that this is a feasible outcome -- hence the celebration/support for any and all type of resistance, no matter how gruesome and inhumane.

Meanwhile, in the current conflict, I've yet to see a reasonable answer as to what Israel should do instead of attacking Hamas? What other country would allow another entity to break through, murder over 1000 civillians, and then take back over 150 hostages? If the line hasn't been crossed now, then how many more massacres will be needed before people realize that Hamas' stated goal is to destroy Israel?

What is a proportional response to an entity like Hamas who's objective is to eliminate Israel entirely? Am geniunely curious if there is an alternative to war because I sure hope there is.

Am open and interested in counterpoints to the above!",thatshirtman,428,0.5799999833106995,1688,1697483567,2023-10-16 14:12:47,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/179e0bf/cmv_israel_over_decades_has_shown_its_willingness/,10,2023
174re4r,CMV: there are too many contradictions in Christianity for it to be real.,"I'm not talking about small contradictions like one or two sentences in the Bible. I'm talking about big things regarding the whole faith. For instance, how God is supposed to be good and benevolent, but yet allows things such as childhood cancer or chronic pain, where you have no chance of recovery or learning. Or how God has created a deterministic world making Free Will impossible. Or how, instead of having proof of God, you are supposed to have Faith, but there are many other religions that require the same thing, so how can you know that Christianity is the right religion?",Square-Dragonfruit76,422,0.6800000071525574,1436,1696960237,2023-10-10 12:50:37,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174re4r/cmv_there_are_too_many_contradictions_in/,10,2023
