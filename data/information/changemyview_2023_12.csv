18rjb74,Cmv: One of the worst things that could happen to a person is being born in a third world country.,"So I’m from Nigeria and I moved to the USA years ago with my father and based on my experiences I believe living in a third world country is one of the worst things to happen to a person. I’ve seen how much my parents have sacrificed just to be in this country. I know how much money my father has paid to get us papers in the United States. I honestly couldn’t even believe he had spent that much money. My dad studied industrial engineering in Nigeria and it didn’t even help him in the United States because most employers see that degree as worthless because he got it in a Nigerian university. He never studied here and so now he has to settle for low wage jobs. My dad works so hard, six days a week and we basically live paycheck to paycheck. It’s tough ngl. I just feel like our lives as a whole would be so much better and stress free if not for the fact that we were born in Nigeria, can see our country falling apart and so now we were forced to make this hard journey here. I was also in Nigeria this summer and the country is rife with so much poverty. This are getting worse every day and the basic amenities I enjoy in the United States are like luxuries over there. While I was in Nigeria, there was a time my electricity went out and we had no electricity for almost an entire day. As a result our water went out and we had to fill up buckets of water at someone else’s house just to be able to wash dishes and flush the toilet. I once spoke to my dad and I asked him “so how does a person in Nigeria live a decent life and fulfill something for themselves” and he told me he doesn’t know. Degrees in Nigeria are almost useless now as there are no jobs whatsoever. 
So in conclusion I feel like being from a third world country is on of the worst things to happen to a person because the struggles of living in one in the first place is stressful,draining and horrible, while the struggles of leaving one is also horrible as you have to endure and sacrifice a lot so either way you will suffer, unless you’re rich I guess.",Various_Beach_7840,1951,0.8999999761581421,743,1703627587,2023-12-26 15:53:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18rjb74/cmv_one_of_the_worst_things_that_could_happen_to/,12,2023
18fx9zx,"CMV: If switching the gender/race/any demographic group in a statement makes that statement sound bigoted, then it was bigoted in the first place. Always.","EDIT: I was wrong to use the word ""sound"" in the title. I meant to make it more understandable, but it detracts from my point. Let me rephrase: If switching the demographic group makes it bigoted, then it was bigoted before the switching too. I used ""sound"" because a lot of people can instinctively recognize some forms of bigotry as bigotry but are blind to the exact same reasoning with just a different demographic group swapped in. I used ""sound"" because, these people blind to bigotry again some groups, they will think ""hey, if you switch the demographic groups, it SOUNDS like bigotry"". As a matter of fact, it IS factually bigoted in both scenarios, both before and after the switching - the ""sound"" was purely relating to the ability of people to recognize bigotry as what it is.


For context, I am a gay, black, Senegalese man. I was born and raised in Senegal, then went to university in France and now I live and work in the USA. The observations that follow have all been made in the USA or online in US-centric spaces.

I have personally witnessed a staggering number of times when someone makes a statement that, if made about women/queer folk/PoC, would be decried as abhorrent and bigoted, but since it's made towards men/straight folks/white people is considered ok, even funny and ""progressive"". There is a whole genre of ""humor"" (and multiple big subreddits dedicated to it) about mocking heterosexual people; I have seen PoCs straight up saying that the opinion of a white person is invalid purely because they are white, etc. Generally, those attitudes seem to come from an utter lack of empathy towards those demographics and every time I see it, I cannot stop thinking that the ""progressive"" people acting in this hateful and discriminatory way would themselves happily be MAGA if they weren't themselves PoCs, queer or women. It is the exact same mindset, casual cruelty and refusal to see ""the other"" as a human being that I see in the worst ""traditional bigots"", just with the demographics switched around.

To get ahead of people pointing out systemic disadvantages: Yes, I know that, in the US of A, white people have more institutional power, men are generally better paid and better considered in the workplace, and het people's human rights are largely secure compared to queer people's rights. All of that is correct. However:

- It does not excuse interpersonal hatred or discrimination. Plainly, if you are hateful towards someone you do not know purely because of their birth-assigned characteristics, you are a profoundly terrible human being, NO MATTER what systemic forces are in place. To use a fictional example that won't lead to people jumping at my throat while refusing all rational discussion: Take Scar from the anime Fullmetal Alchemist. He is a survivor from Ishval, member of a racial minority that was slaughtered by the richer Amestrians. Scar's reaction is to go on a murderous rampage during which he kills, among many others, two innocent Amestrian doctors who were healing Ishvalans on the battlefield, then he tries to murder their even-more-innocent underage daughter. Just because they have blonde hair, which is a sign of Amestrians. Scar associates the entire demographic group with evil people (due to trauma, and he has every reason to), yet his blind hatred of all Amestrians IS wrong, because there are many innocent Amestrians.

- The systemic issues present in the USA are really only present in the USA. I have lived on three different continents, including Africa. I have been told time and time again that ""white people have all the power everywhere"" and that ""there is not one place where PoC are systematically advantaged."" I am strongly convinced that those arguments are born from extreme ethnocentrism from Americans who are not even aware that there exists a world outside of the USA. In MOST countries in the world, white people are a minority, and while they are often seen as a ""model minority"", they don't have more power in my native Senegal or in China or Japan or India than Asian-Americans have in the USA.

- The systemic issues in question, even if only look within the USA, were not born by accident. They are the result of the fact *the majority of the population held bigoted beliefs* for long enough for those beliefs to become ""mainstream"". That's really all it takes. If the ""white people are all trash"" and ""kill all men"" mentalities were to become more popular, they WOULD absolutely shift the systemic imbalances to cause systemic discriminations against white people and men respectively. I'd argue that, on a small scale and in some specific contexts, this is already happen. 

In brief: A person who negatively judges and/or treats all members of [demographic group] just because they are members of [demographic group] is a hateful bigot, NO MATTER what that [demographic group] is. White, Black, Asian, Native American, male, female, gay, straight, pan, asexual... all of them, without exception.",Realistic_Ad5850,1740,0.8299999833106995,647,1702309010,2023-12-11 09:36:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18fx9zx/cmv_if_switching_the_genderraceany_demographic/,12,2023

I think a lot of people that commit suicide had some problem and they were not able to solve it and it’s very unfortunate but a lot of the time the bigger problem was society and the pressure it did put on the person who ended their life.

Everyone who loves cops unconditionally has Stockholm syndrome. I feel that by willingly choosing to do a job that for the most part oppresses people and makes money for the government, you are a terrible person. Oh you accidentally made a right turn when you didn’t see that the no right turn sign was on? Fuck you, pay me, even though you probably can’t afford it. I don’t need some cocky 24 year old with an ego problem to come “save me”. Human being should be able to take care of themselves. A wise man once said “whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward. Whoever cannot take care of himself without that law is both.”

 I have never had a cop speak to me with respect, so why should I respect them?

18tm3i8,CMV: Social media is destroying western society slowly like a cancer.,"When people spend so much time looking at what other people are doing, they lose all creativity and chase what is “cool”. They’re wasting time on their phone accomplishing nothing other than increasing their jealousy and anxiety while they can be spending that time being productive. All independence and privacy has gone out the window to oversharing and following meaningless trends. 

TikTok is the worst iteration of this. The algorithm is specifically made to influence young people’s worldview. From the moment you create an account you’re bombarded with dangerous messaging. Gen Z is completely addicted to this, and the platform is now where the youngest generation is receiving their news. Why does China have a different version of TikTok? It’s almost like they know it’s poison, so they don’t want to give it to their youth, but are happy to give it to western youth. There are obviously also concerns about the Chinese government using this app to steal personal information from its users.

Is there actually a positive argument to be made for social media? How can anyone think spending time on your phone and watching what people (most of whom you don’t know) are up to is anything other than idiotic?",bkny88,1008,0.8600000143051147,395,1703853038,2023-12-29 06:30:38,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18tm3i8/cmv_social_media_is_destroying_western_society/,12,2023

Until Trump made the poisoning blood comment, I disagreed with accusations saying Trump is racist as he somewhat drew a clear line between attacking someone based on their race and based on immigration status or religious beliefs. But man, ""poisoning our blood""? This is a dangerous statement not only because was used by the Nazis but also because it implies certain blood is ""clean"" and certain blood is ""poisonous"". Trump did not specify what blood is clean but it can be easily deduced from the demographic of the crowd listening to that statement.

18rl1qx,CMV: It's really weird that the Holocaust has been completely claimed by Jews,"Just a few to things to make 100% clear. I am absolutely not denying that 6 million Jews were killed in an attempt of genocide by Nazi Germany. This is not an attempt to revise the Holocaust or deny any part of it. Quite the opposite, actually. I am also not saying in any way that Jews cannot or should not claim victim hood. They were massively victimized and are still today. These are not part of my point at all.

Something that's been bothering me for a while is that the Holocaust has been broadly accepted and talked about as purely a genocide against Jews. Most people I know who I've talked to about WWII or the Holocaust think that there were only (relatively speaking, of course) 6 million Holocaust victims. This is not true. There were 6 million victims who were Jewish. There was another 5-6 million who were not Jewish, but disabled, LGBT, and non Jewish ethnic/racial minorities. Anyone ""degenerate"" or ""inferior"".

You may be wondering why it matters. Here's why it bothers me:
1. Nearly half of the victims of the Holocaust are practically erased by only focusing on the 6 million Jews. It's not right to suggest 6 million is inflated and it's not right to only speak on half of the victims of the Holocaust, in my view.
2. Fascism of all kinds have similar strategies and talking points, but the Nazis and Hitler gained a special level of hatred among the general population, seemingly globally. Only focusing on the anti-Semitic propaganda and tropes causes us to miss propaganda and tropes of other groups from the same source. This is happening in the US towards several minority groups, but the parallels are ignored because we're not educated on ALL of the trash Nazi Germany pumped out and perpetrated.

To change my view, you need to explain why my concerns are moot and/or that the other 5-6 non Jewish deaths are not as ignored as I feel they are.

Also, I'm an American speaking on what I experience in America and online in mostly American communities. I don't know how Holocaust education or discourse is outside of the US.

Edit: I figured this wouldn't take too long. I had assumed that other groups were treated just as bad as Jews were, but that was incorrect. There's also the fact that the Jewish population is the only group victimized that did not significantly recover from the same event. Also, I didn't realize that ""Holocaust"" is literally a term used for the Jewish deaths exclusively and the other murders are considered separately. These things have changed my view.

18805hr,CMV: Saying 'Yeah' isn't disrespectful,"When I was younger I was in a group and we were having a discussion with the leader, an older guy. He asked me something and I said “Yeah” but before I could complete what I was saying he interrupted and said “yes”. I didn’t really understand what he meant but later he asked something again I said “yeah” and again he interrupted me saying “The proper term is yes.

I’ve seen this happen a few times through my life both with myself and others. Saying yeah or any other way of speaking isn’t disrespectful.

18enrh2,"CMV: The criticism of Hitler's paintings as ""ugly"" is not based off of the quality of Hitler's art itself, but rather, the critics' dislike of Hitler as a person.","You would be hard pressed to find a single art critic who holds a neutral or positive view of Adolf Hitler's paintings; they near-unanimously criticize his paintings as *ugly, lacking talent, lacking merit,* etc.

Now, whether one likes Hitler's paintings or not is entirely subjective (you can Google them for yourself and see what you think of them. Most of them are sketches or paintings of buildings, architecture, mountains, scenery, etc.) But I can't help but suspect that the real reason Hitler's art is criticized so heavily by art critics is because they are afraid of the political consequences of saying anything remotely positive about it, especially in the era of social media and cancel culture.

To put it another way, if, say, Barack Obama, Greta Thunberg or Martin Luther King Jr. had painted those **exact same** paintings - or if you showed Hitler's paintings to some art critic without that critic knowing who the painter was - I strongly suspect those same art critics would either hold a neutral/noncritical view or be praising the paintings/sketches as *artistic, beautiful, well-drawn,* etc. 

Whether Hitler's paintings are good or not has absolutely nothing to do with him being a genocidal tyrant.

18q5tdv,CMV: The Romani Holocaust organised by Nazi Germany is not talked about nearly as much as it should,"Alongside Jews, the [Romani people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people) were treated as sub-humans. As a result, they were persecuted and put into death camps the way Jews were under Nazi rule. It's estimated that [250,000 to 500,000 Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_Holocaust) were murdered, about 25-50% of the Romani population at the time. A scholar even estimated that 1.5 million Romani might have died out of a population of 2 million. 

I did not learn about this until recent months, and I'm sure many reading this post aren't aware either. Their Holocaust was only recognised by West Germany in 1982, and many official recognitions only came about in the 2000s. The reason for that is complicated but probably due to a combination of strong anti-Roma racism in Europe, especially Eastern Europe, the lack of collective memory and the lack of documentation.

I think that every time we talk about the Holocaust, we need to recognise that it's not only the Jewish people that were genocided, the Romani people were too and need to be addressed together.",GoSouthCourt,874,0.8600000143051147,273,1703458272,2023-12-24 16:51:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18q5tdv/cmv_the_romani_holocaust_organised_by_nazi/,12,2023
18m9szu,"CMV: If trump wins it won't be the fault of the left or of young people for not voting, it will be the fault of moderate liberals and centrists for choosing bad candidates in the primaries.","1.  The left and the youth always get blamed whenever republicans win but most if not all of the time it's because moderates force through corporate democrats under the guise of ""electability"" even when that claim is verifiably false (ie: bernie being a stronger head to head matchup against trump than biden was in the polls) even against the complaints of the same people they always accuse of not turning out to vote.
If they want those groups to vote they need to be willing to make a sacrifice and support legitimately good candidates in the primaries even if it makes them uncomfortable, ""vote blue no matter who"" can't just be a slogan to browbeat the left with, it cuts both ways, they need to suck it up and vote blue no matter who even if that blue is a leftist candidate. The best way to get the leftists in your party to show up for the election is to be willing to compromise and support a candidate they can actually get excited about.

2. There is a disparity of motive between the moderates and the left. The left has legitimate moral reason to hate the candidates moderates push through the primaries due to the massive harm and loss of life their foreign policy inflicts upon helpless people abroad as well as the concessions they make to corporations, this is especially prevalent this election cycle with biden overtly funding and vocally supporting the genocide of the Palestinian people in gaza as well as admitting that he himself is a zionist, zionism being an inherently imperialist/fascistic ideology which supports the creation and expansion of an ethnostate.
The moderates however, have no such moral complaints against left leaning candidates and instead base most of their complaints in emotion and fear; making vague statements about them being ""too far left"" or ""not electable enough"" and repeating talking points from McCarthyism/the red scare which have no backing or basis in reality especially seeing as leftist candidates tend to support policies that have much broader appeal than the moderates do on a policy by policy basis and often fare better in direct match-ups against the opposition. This has been proven in real world scenarios as well with left leaning candidates winning in deep red states against republican candidates where the democratic party routinely takes losses when putting forth centrist/corporatist candidates. Essentially the left has a legitimate moral justification whereas moderates are acting out of fear and discomfort and tend to push through candidates that make them feel comfortable even if those candidates are monstrous human beings who shouldn't be allowed anywhere near power.

3. Moderates in the democratic voter base have forced this choice on the left for decades and it always results in a back and forth fight with the party in power switching every few years as things slowly get worse. Whereas in those locations where further left leaning candidates win, those areas tend to stay blue much longer as a result of the people living there seeing the positive effect of the policies left leaning candidates put into place.


4. All this to say that If moderates want to actually win elections, they need to stop supporting candidates that are widely unliked by both sides of the political spectrum and stop blaming ""the left"" when it is observably their fault that this is happening. ""The left"" can't be logically blamed when their candidates are consistently more successful when given the chance in real elections. It's moderates that are costing us elections and it's moderates that will be at fault for the US slipping into a full blown fascist dictatorship if they hand the presidency to trump by putting forth a nominee nobody likes.


Things that won't change my mind:

1. ***""It's actually conservatives fault""*** Yeah, sure I agree, they're bad people and ultimately to blame, but it's a waste of time and effort to try and change their minds. We should focus on groups that actually can change. Those are leftists and moderates and of the two moderates don't have a real justification for continuing to impose their bs on others.

2. ***""but biden did (insert good thing here)""*** Biden/any centrist doing good things on occasion, or even often does not outweigh the lives they take with their foreign policy and it certainly doesn't outweigh outright genocide.

3. Appealing to me personally to vote for him. This isn't about my vote; it's about how if he loses I won't blame leftists/the youth, I'll blame moderates who constantly saddle us with unappealing nominees that are so bad it's more surprising when they win than when they lose.

4. ***""biden doesn't actually have control over what happens in gaza/biden is already trying to stop it""*** This one I've heard a lot recently and the first part is dubious at best, israel could not do what it does without the funding the US gives it and biden has control over that the second part is easily disproven with his own words and actions.",Aberration-13,854,0.6499999761581421,2186,1703013121,2023-12-19 13:12:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18m9szu/cmv_if_trump_wins_it_wont_be_the_fault_of_the/,12,2023

18kj9d0,"CMV: We should spend more time helping people who are poor, than obsessing over race & identity.","By ‘poor’, I am encompassing anyone who is struggling, or living hand to mouth right now. Mainly for the sake of brevity. 

For the past 10 years the rhetorical focus of governments, charities and corporations alike has been on race/gender/sexuality. And poverty has taken a back seat in the conversation.

A cynic might point out that ‘fighting’ some amorphous spectre of ‘racism’ with a few D&I schemes is much cheaper for the Goldman & Sachs’ of the world than actually trying to solve wealth inequality.

The best argument for the focus on race has been to look at outcomes. Minorities tend to have disproportionately worse health care outcomes, education, incarceration etc. 

But in the U.K. at least, when you control for socioeconomics, these outcome gaps disappear almost completely. With white children even fairing worse than minorities with respect to education outcomes.

It would seem that the racial inequality we see today is largely the result of wealth inequality, rather than deliberate racism - institutional or individual.

Instead of focusing on helping the poor, we spend our time teaching wealthy kids they are ‘oppressed’ because of the identity group they belong to. Creating a atmosphere of paranoia, assuming every other person is a secret racist/bigot.

Our leaders should be the best of us, not just the lesser of two shitheads

This is a large part of the reason why i loved Obama despite not being a democrat. He was the perfect leader. Physically and mentally strong, brilliant and charismatic to a fault. He was a damn near perfect human being, regardless of his policies. 

When other nations look at our president they should expect them to reflect us. We should only have the best of the best, the creme de la crop of our society run for office. 

The smartest, most cunning, strongest, charismatic, youthful. The best of us, not the worst.

Edit: 

I’ll concede on the following:

- Upper age limit should be 65, not 50

- I don’t know how to measure how smart someone is. I know IQ tests suck. I will have to delta you if you make me try to actually implement this as opposed to dream it. I will still hold thag only smart people should be allowed to run

- Physically fit is about the least important thing on this list. They don’t need abs. I just don’t want another morbidly obese president like trump to be allowed to run

While not *real* children, the designs for these children are clearly and undeniably derivative from real life human children. I.e. Kobato Hasegawa, a popular loli that has a very clear child’s body proportions and behavior. 

This is why anyone, even someone who doesn’t watch anime, can watch a lolicon anime and recognize that these characters are human, and which characters are children - without having to be told. 

It’s visually apparent to everyone because it clearly derives from real human children and everyone knows what that looks like. 

The sole defining characteristic of the genre is the sexualization of specifically prepubescent girls. The fact that this aspect is the defining feature of the genre is because prepubescent anime girls make loli fans aroused. As I have shown that lolis are based off and designed to resemble human children, this is pedophilic.

18fx9i0,"CMV: Biden / Dems have failed immensely by not raising taxes on the wealthy, which would be beneficial to the United States economy","Dems campaign heavily on taxing the ""rich"" and reducing wealth disparity.  However we have seen basically none of that.  I think taxing the rich would reduce wealth disparity, reduce inflation, and lower the deficit, and would be overall a boon to the US economy at large, and that Dems have totally failed to implement any laws to do this in spite of their promises to do just that.

I am not necessarily talking about anything like the 90% taxes like we've seen historically, or even necessarily a ""wealth"" tax.  Even something like increasing capital gains tax to match income taxes would be reasonable, and increasing the top brackets / creating new brackets for people making 10s of millions.

To clarify my points: taxing the wealthy:

A. Would reduce the deficit

B. Would reduce inflation without taxing the poor/middle class

C. Would reduce wealth disparity and many of the negative symptoms of it

D. Could be implemented in a reasonable, measured way

E. Is something the Dems have routinely promised and failed to deliver, and these days they fail to even bring up the topic

F. Fiscal policy is extremely important and the Dems are at best clowns and at worst immoral in failing to address it.

At the risk of getting away from the subject, I would also argue that many of the topics Dems focus on pale in comparison to the importance of good fiscal policy, and Dems pander with social issues instead of fixing economic issues that would have magnitudes higher benefit to the poor and middle class they claim to champion.

I would also argue Trump failed by slashing taxes during a booming economy prior to the pandemic.  The Republicans are obviously don't even pretend to want to raise taxes on the wealthy, which is why I didn't bring them up.

I have also tried doing these things without making other people feel excluded and explaining ideas in a simple manner, but seems like most people just care about surface level discussions and somehow think discussing anything in depth makes you a pretentious narcissist.  
And this is not just limited to personal experience. In most scenarios, people club anyone bringing up anything remotely intelligent as pretentious and feel the need to one up the person by clubbing him/her into categories like r/iamverysmart or something similar. Its such a disgrace. I also feel like this stems from an anti-elitist mentality but even that is harmful for us as it hinders innovation and lateral thinking.  


However I agree that I may be wrong, so please feel free to give reasons as to why this kind of behavior is justified. And like I said, this is not just from personal experience even though that plays its own part, but this is a sentiment I have seen being echoed very frequently no matter which kind of circle you are in, so please keep that in mind as well before criticizing me or assuming that somehow I am a douche who is trying to justify his actions by calling other people out.

18lnxlf,CMV: Incels cannot influence movie box office numbers and cause flops in the way that is constantly claimed on social media,"I want to start by saying that I completely understand that incels exist, and that they can cause many issues for everyone; not just for the women they target, but also for men that get in their crosshairs.

One aspect where I am not believing that they have any meaningful influence as portrayed on social media: **movies and box office numbers**. Every time a movie comes out with a female lead and/or majority female cast, or a ""diversity casting"" as they constantly complain, if that movie flops, you have people screaming ""incels didn't watch the movie because they are scared of women, so of course it became a box office flop! But it's a great movie!"". If a movie is cast with a male lead and it flops, we usually do not hear the same rage from social media that ""<insert group name> did not like this movie because <reasons> and that's why it flopped"", as compared to when incels are brought up.

We have had some stellar box office numbers from female-led movies (e.g. Barbie, great film, loved it) and we've had some flops (from both male and female actors). Notable recent flop that made me want to bring this up: The Marvels. I saw the movie in the cinema when it first came out, really enjoyed it, but it was not a packed room on the opening weekend. Every time someone brings up ""incels are to blame!"" I usually answer ""why didn't women go to watch this movie since they want to support women in movies so much?"". Zero meaningful opposite responses, every time. The movie had decent Rotten Tomatoes scores, and was reviewed mostly positively elsewhere.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe that the number of incels that exist, that can influence movie box office numbers, is a statistically meaningful number. Not men in relationships (since incels are not in relationships), just incels that get constantly blamed for movies flopping. Even if incels complain on social media to try to ruin a movie by review-bombing it, it is pretty obvious when that happens; I have yet to see proof that review-bombing even works with these box office flops.",sinayion,608,0.8199999928474426,446,1702944720,2023-12-18 18:12:00,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18lnxlf/cmv_incels_cannot_influence_movie_box_office/,12,2023
18o0ha9,"CMV: Censoring a non-crude word pertaining to a difficult subject, like 'rape', is ridiculous and a category error.","I very recently saw an infographic about abortion laws in Europe by country, describing the permissibility of abortion and in which circumstances. It was a broadly informative or at least serious and non-frivolous infographic. And yet the word 'rape' was censored to 'r\*pe' in the legend -- in the context of 'abortions allowed in case of rape'.  
  
This is very far from the first time I've seen this sort of thing; in fact, it seems to be everywhere these days, and I'm mystified by it. What is going on with the censoring of normal words that pertain to difficult subjects? And how has it gotten to the point that in informational charts that's seen as an acceptable thing to do?  
  
I understand censoring words deemed to be crude or offensive, like 'fuck'. I understand as well that if I were writing a blog post and I thought my audience might be triggered by difficult concepts, I might give a trigger warning that rape will be discussed.  
  
I don't understand in the least who is being served by censoring the word itself. The word 'rape' is not a bad word. Rape, of course, is abominable. But the word 'rape' is not -- i.e, it's not impolite or crude to say the word.  
  
I see this all over the place now, but only very selectively applied. You never see 'murder' censored to 'm\*rder' or something, though I'm sure we all agree murder is abominable as well.  
  
And if the idea is indeed to censor the word so as to avoid someone being 'triggered' by it in some way -- well, censoring one letter of it won't achieve that at all, will it?  
  
There seems to be a category error going on, in which people are **censoring** the normal and accurate word in lieu of **censuring** a very terrible act. But that's completely bonkers, in addition to being infantilizing!

There's a real danger to the idea that one ought to censor a word pertaining to a difficult topic, instead of censoring crude words meant to degrade or be offensive. 'Rape' is not a word meant to degrade or be offensive (though of course the act is infinitely offensive -- obviously no argument there); instead, the word is a normal, accurate descriptor used up to and including in legal terminology to describe a heinous act. Censoring such a word is madness, not least because if it becomes the norm to do so, one might well be censured themselves for using the word uncensored. What irony.

In other words, they use a slippery-slope argument when telling friends and family why they must refuse any and all drinks, not even ""just a sip.""

Same with ex-smokers. Many ex-smokers cannot smoke again, not even just a single cigarette, because doing so could push them all the way towards total relapse again. Same with many illegal drugs, or an ex-gambler gambling even ""just one time."" They invoke the slippery-slope argument.

The COVID protesters were another big example to me, like who believed that a few angry people hanging out on a street corner were going to stop state level vaccine mandates. The mandates decreased over time because that is how they are supposed to work and people screaming at street corners were like toddlers through a tantrum for attention.

Last and I think the worst is some of the current environmental protest. Closing a road or gluing yourself to a highway will not stop massive multinational corporations from doing business.

18ffduw,CMV: Afrocentrism is a growing problem that needs to be publicly addressed in the school system,"Particularly African-Americans, I’m seeing this start to pop up all over my social media and real life. I understand where African-Americans come from when they say they weren’t taught about African history, empires, and world changing events, so they feel left behind when compared to how other societies and empires are taught in America; particularly Britain, Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and the Aztecs even, but this Afrocentrist idea of “they were all black before the modern people invaded and stole from our black ancestors” is becoming increasingly problematic social media issue and seeping over into real life. 

This all may seem out of the blue but as an Italian man, I’ve been seeing that “the original Italians were black” popping up across my feed, after seeing countless “the Greeks were black”, “the Egyptians were black”, “the Chinese were black”, “native Americans were black”. 

After getting into the classic instagram comment argument, the common argument is that, at least for European people and societies like the Greeks, Italians, and even the British; claiming that since Western Hunter Gatherers were darker skinned people than modern European populations, that these African-Americans can claim these people and societies as their own despite not being genetically, linguistically, culturally, historically related to them in anyway.

To sum it up. I think that this needs to be addressed either by better education on who these people, societies, and empires were and their modern descendants, and that sub-Saharan societies, people, and empires need to be better taught in the American educational system to combat against “claiming the next best thing as our own since we don’t know our own”.

18kajht,CMV: Blaming Bad Policy On 'White Men' Is Wrong And Politically Stupid,"I've been mulling over a topic [after reading it here](https://www.nationalmemo.com/ken-paxton-2666596245) and I think deserves our attention: the counterproductive and politically naive trend of blaming complex societal issues solely on 'white men'. This isn't just about being politically correct; it's about understanding the deeper, nuanced factors that contribute to policy decisions and societal changes.  
  
Consider this: Blaming 'white men' as a homogenous group for the challenges in reproductive rights or other social issues oversimplifies the problem and alienates potential allies. It's essential to remember that characteristics like gender, race, and age aren't opinions or ideologies. Yet, we often see this generalization, especially in certain left-leaning circles and media. For instance, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski repeatedly criticized Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, focusing on his race and age rather than his actions or policies.  
  
Let's take a step back and think about this. When we reduce individuals to just their physical attributes, we miss out on engaging in more meaningful, policy-focused discussions. It's easy to forget that people of all backgrounds can hold a variety of views. Texas Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar, for example, votes against abortion rights. Would it be fair or accurate to reduce his stance to his ethnicity? Certainly not.  
  
This trend isn't just unhelpful; it's politically harmful. By alienating groups, we risk pushing them towards opposing political agendas that may not align with their interests. Remember, the Supreme Court justices who established Roe v. Wade were predominantly white men. It’s about perspectives and policies, not just physical attributes.  
  
Moreover, this kind of rhetoric can be easily weaponized by political opponents. When we engage in this oversimplification, we inadvertently provide ammunition for figures like Donald Trump to rally against us, further polarizing the political landscape.  
  
So, what should we do? It's crucial to focus on policies, actions, and ideologies rather than resorting to broad, unhelpful stereotypes. Complex issues demand complex discussions, not reductive blame games.  
  
What are your thoughts on this? Have you noticed this trend, and how do you think we can shift the conversation to be more inclusive and productive?  
  
Looking forward to your insights and discussions!

18nxu13,CMV: The concept of cultural appropriation is very toxic since it prevents religious and cultural innovation much like intellectual property,"When I mentioned that I (a gentile) read the Zohar to see if I could learn something from it. I received about a dozen death threats from Jews and Native Americans claiming that Gentiles could not practice Kabbalah since it was cultural appropriation. I think this behavior is very wrong, and if it is successful it will make people see the group as uninteresting and dangerous.   
  
Uninteresting and dangerous is not what a cultural group should be aiming to be perceived as. This makes it a lot easier to dehumanize such a group. In fact I'd even go as far as to say cultural appropriation mobs are actively inviting dehumanization. I believe there is a sizeable portion of the population who would as an outsider perceive Judaism and Jewish people positively and defend Jewish people from antisemitism, but after receiving enough death threats from Jewish people over their expressed interest in Judaism would no longer act to prevent a hate crime or worse.  
  
I don't think this behavior would ever turn someone into a raving antisemite, but I do think it will make people indifferent to the plight of Jewish people, or any other ethnic group which engages in this behavior. It is basically soft power suicide.  
  
I think the most reasonable position is to treat this issue like intellectual property today. Jews should not be able to do a DMCA takedown on all of Christianity and Islam for the Old Testament, and Jewish literature that is legally considered in the public domain should be considered socially acceptable for anyone to read. The Zohar is either from 1240, or the second century, either way it is in public domain at this point.  
  
Most Kabbalistic literature is in the public domain.  I think people should be able to read it freely and learn what they please from it. Not saying all Jewish people need to be happy about it, but I think they should accept it on the basis that these books are out in the public, and accepting people reading them is a worthwhile soft power tradeoff.  
  
I do believe however that using names and titles that may cause brand confusion is more of a problem, and this may apply to some extent to symbols and iconography. I consider Qabalah and Cabala as sufficiently differentiated terms due to their centuries of historical usage outside of Judaism, but a gentile claiming to practice Kabbalah might be something that is worthy of civil lawsuits or criminal charges. Kabbalah Centre is a bit weird because it is Jewish-run, so I don't think it could reasonably be called cultural appropriation. However things like deity names should not count in this since they are deities not brand names.  
  
Likewise, I think this applies to other groups too. People should be free to read public domain books on Native American religion and learn from them. If a white person wants to worship Quetzalcoatl they should be free to do so and not face criminal charges or death threats, but they should not be able to say they are practicing ""Aztec religion"" since they are not Nahua, they are just a white person worshipping a common deity.   
  
I believe this cultural influence leads to long lasting soft power, as even if the ideas are quite transformed, their cultural presence will lead people towards respecting the culture they originated in, even if it sometimes doesn't immediately translate into the short term.

This also limits the ability of new cultural and religious practices to be developed which is detrimental to society as a whole. We should want a dynamic culture that develops new ideas, and enforcing strict ownership rules over cultural ideas is harmful to this.",their-holiness,403,0.7699999809265137,326,1703194099,2023-12-21 15:28:19,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18nxu13/cmv_the_concept_of_cultural_appropriation_is_very/,12,2023
18cacyg,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,"I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating.",wettigingss,403,0.5600000023841858,2949,1701886825,2023-12-06 12:20:25,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18cacyg/cmv_dating_is_objectively_harder_for_men_than_it/,12,2023
18ff9s9,"CMV: As a person on the autism spectrum, it is valid for someone to not date a person with a disability due to concerns of baggage and burnout associated with dating a person with a disability","So I am a man on the autism spectrum and while I never had a woman reject me because of my diagnosis, I know that there are some women who do not want to date a man with a disability *that has nothing to do with societal prejudices and biases against people with disabilities*. Now there are people on YouTube who made videos back in 2016 stating that if you are not attracted to or do not want to date a minority because of something related to their status as a member of a minority group, then you are somehow hold prejudiced views against that group of people and have implicit biases instilled from a society that doesn't fully embrace diversity and inclusion.

&#x200B;

Now while I concede that there are **some** people who never want to date a person with a disability either out of implicit biases from an ableist society or the person outright hates people with disabilities, most people who do not want to date a person with a disability do so because they do not want to be burdened with the hassle of caring for a person with a disability.

Disabilities come in all forms and can be physical, mental, or both. Being in a romantic relationship with someone means sharing your life with another person and when it comes to disability, that often means the able-bodied partner is adversely impacted by their disabled partner's disability. Some people do not want to deal with the baggage of being a partner and a caregiver for a person with a disability, or having to deal with social awkwardness, communication issues, and mental health problems. Now, there are some nice people out there who do not mind dating a person with a disability, even if it means being a caregiver and having to live with their partner's disability. 

That said, there are some SJWs (social justice warriors) who feel the need to shame people and call them ""ableist"" for not wanting to date a person with a disability. Dating is a personal choice and nobody is entitled to a date, regardless of what minority group they are part of. Being a caregiver for a person with a disability can lead to ""caregiver burnout"" and anxiety. Those are valid concerns and reasons not to date a person with a disability. I know it is not fair that some people do not want to date me because of my autism, but it's their prerogative and I would rather find someone who is fully willing to date me despite my quirks than deal with someone who is being a poor partner and is dating me out of fear of being called a bigot and being canceled on social media for having ""ableist dating preferences"".

Again, there are always haters who choose not to date people with disabilities out of outright hate, but not all people are like that. Concerns about caregiver fatigue and the time spent caring for a person with a disability is a valid point not to date a person with a disability that has no basis in ableism and bigotry.",Prudent-Reporter-400,396,0.8600000143051147,191,1702247380,2023-12-10 16:29:40,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ff9s9/cmv_as_a_person_on_the_autism_spectrum_it_is/,12,2023
18uib7l,CMV: The rate at which words evolve to be unacceptable in any context has been increasing and words should never have so much power over us that they are unacceptable regardless of context.,"I had a bit of a false start with this one for a multitude of reasons, the most significant of which were not censoring the language I used and combining two different topics that really ought not have been combined.

I chose not to censor the language partly because despite every other major subreddit that I'm aware of doing so, the mods here do not censor language, something that I view favorably. I also had used these words on this subreddit prior in a similar context (speaking about censorship) in a comment that was well-received. I truly was not expecting the initial reaction I received and I was not trying to offend anybody.

After a conversation with the mods, it would seem the best course of action is to separate my two topics of conversation entirely. I'm still choosing not to censor the language. If my language offends you or makes you uncomfortable, that is indicative of exactly what I am speaking about. I'm essentially asking you to ask yourself why exactly that would be the case and ultimately, the deltas available will revolve around you explaining to me why the emotional reaction you're experiencing is correct.

The last time I posted this, it turned into a bit of a shitshow immediately. While I'm not one to phone the internet police, the mods here are pretty anal about keeping their threads clean so please keep Rule 1 (top-level comments must challenge my view) and Rule 2 (don't be a dick) in mind in your responses.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qm68p/cmv_nigger_is_a_bad_word/) is a link to the previous thread. There are several replies of mine that can give you a decent idea of where my head's at and you can even bring quotes of mine from that thread in here to use in your replies if you like.

*

I have been alive to witness at least a bit of the evolution of the word faggot. When I was growing up, it was essentially used synonymously with asshole or douchebag. I remember vividly an interview Eminem gave about the Marshall Mathers LP (2000) when I was 13 in which he said ""When I say 'you faggots keep egging me on' I don't mean 'you gay people keep egging me on'"" and I remember thinking 'I can't believe he just had to explain that.'
 
Now faggot is just as derogatory as nigger and it would seem retard is fast approaching if not there already. There was also backlash against both [Lizzo and Beyonce (and Weird Al!)](https://slate.com/culture/2022/08/beyonce-renaissance-lizzo-spaz-ableist-slur-lyrics-history.html) in recent memory for using the word spaz.

Even this website has evolved. When I first arrived (2013), both faggot and retard were commonly used in various memes, and while I can't remember ever coming across nigger (worth noting that it may have been auto-removed by most subreddits since the site's inception though I can't know that) I do recall people casually throwing around nigga now and then. Now this subreddit itself is the only major subreddit I'm aware of that does not censor language and have all posts that contain any of these words removed automatically.
 
The N-word has been the N-word since I've been alive. I was not present to witness its evolution but I would have to imagine it went through something similar. I never questioned it because for me it had always been part of my established reality. But having now witnessed this evolution happen myself a couple times along with the threat of it continuing to happen more, it does give me cause to question if words evolving to have so much power over us that they're unacceptable in any context and being essentially forcibly removed from our vernacular is the correct direction. Something about it gives me '1984' vibes.",Aggressive-Carob6256,396,0.6800000071525574,530,1703950826,2023-12-30 09:40:26,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18uib7l/cmv_the_rate_at_which_words_evolve_to_be/,12,2023
18t5hpd,CMV: Homeschooling should be way more heavily regulated if not outright illegal,"Homeschooling can sound like a good option to some people. Parents know their kids best, and can give their child all the attention they need and not be split among a whole class like a teacher is. That’s the idea at least. But in reality, that is not what happens most of the time. 

In most cases homeschooling is just a way for parents to have complete control over their kids lives and abuse them more easily or indoctrinate them into their own religious/political beliefs. We’ve all heard the horror stories of kids being unschooled and unable to even spell their name even as a 10 or 11 year old. Obviously cases this bad are not common, but the very fact that this is allowed to happen in the system AT ALL is a sign that it needs to be reformed. [Of parents who homeschool 75% say they do so to provide moral instruction. 59% do it to provide religious instruction.](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/tgk/homeschooled-children). Now you can criticize public schooling, but it certainly doesn’t fail to provide a moral backbone to kids or equip them to think critically about their own moral views and expose them to many different ideas. This makes me believe that these parents aren’t dissatisfied with public schools because of good faith criticisms of its curriculum, but because they don’t teach their own religious or political views as fact. Kids are not the property of their parents, they have a right to a good education, not an indoctrination into their parents’ ideas. Homeschooling often does not provide the wide variety of people and worldviews that defines public schooling and creates kids who cannot think for themselves as adults. 

Homeschooling also often fails to provide kids adequate social connections to other children. This is important not just for their own personal growth, but for them to learn what a “normal” childhood is like. It’s a lot easier to believe that parental abuse is normal if you don’t meet many kids who don’t experience it. It’s another form of control given to parents who usually are not trustworthy.  [Parents who engage in child neglect or educational mistreatment are more likely to use homeschooling as a guise.](https://digitalcommons.cwu.edu/source/2013/oralpresentations/137/). 

I am aware that academically homeschool kids tend to do a little better on standardized tests. But this only makes me more concerned, as based on the other data  it seems like parents are teaching for the test and not the actual skills the test is trying to measure. The point of social studies classes is not to know in what year Columbus crossed the ocean, but rather how to think critically about history, parse through information and different sources, and synthesize information to come to their own conclusions. Public school doesn’t do this perfectly, but it is at the very least the goal, unlike homeschooling for many people.

On the other hand, there are a significant minority of homeschooled kids who are due to having special needs, or from having suffered some negative experience at school that makes them feel unsafe. I do think this is a legitimate reason to homeschool, but I’d still like to see these types of kids returned to public school once the system has found better means to teach these kids and prevent abuses.

Ultimately I think this comes back to control. I think homeschooling gives parents way too much control over their kid’s life. Traditionally, kids were raised by and taught by the entire local community. We evolved to learn that way. Modern schools allow for kids to learn from a wide variety of people and curriculums are influenced by the entire community or nation. But homeschooling gives all that power to one or two people, who even at best are flawed human beings with blind spots. If you have a bad teacher at a public school it won’t be long before you’re in a different class with another teacher, and you have some mechanisms to remove that bad teacher. If your homeschool “teacher” is bad, there is almost nothing you can do and they teach every class. That’s just a bad system to put the future of humanity into.",LineOfInquiry,394,0.7099999785423279,430,1703799916,2023-12-28 15:45:16,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18t5hpd/cmv_homeschooling_should_be_way_more_heavily/,12,2023

18t6eoz,Cmv: The majority of people supporting Palestine in the west don't know what they are really supporting.,"I will start out by saying the Palestinians have been mistreated by Israel and surrounding Arab states and need a state but I believe Israel has a right to exist. A 2 state solution which I think is the majority view of people in the west not involved directly in the conflict.

When the college presidents were before Congress being wishy washy about the calls for genocide being a violation of the code of conduct I really believe one of the reasons was to protect there students. With the river to the sea slogan when used in the past and to certain extent today by Palestinians means a call for all Jewish people to be removed from the area and I dont think students really are aware of that so I don't think the majority of them chanting it were actually calling for genocide in their eyes even though through a lot of peoples eyes they were. I don't think students should be exspelled for not understanding the full context of a slogan and I think the college presidents understood that. A lot of students had no idea what river and what sea it was even referring too.

Another big thing I see is the right of return and a call for democratic state where both people live together I personally don't see how this doesn't end horribly for everyone involved if you snapped your fingers and made this a reality tomorrow. Even a structured right of return not overnight would end in escalation in hostility between both groups that would be a net negative for both people in my opinion. This is an amazing dream for well into the future but this is not a reality now. To give an example imagine if Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi people all returned to there homes from before partition and they were all one state do you think that goes well at all? I wish in perfect world it did but that's not the reality. I really don't think a lot of people protesting in the street realize the consequences that full right of return would have with tensions being so high.

My last point is some people portraying Israeli's as white and Palestinians as non white. I think most of the people in general would not be able to pick out who was Palestinian or Israeli in a line up. This I think comes from Americans ideas on race which don't really apply to this conflict and makes me think a lot of people saying this have never actually met a Palestinian or Israeli or even read up or watched anything longer then a Instagram story on it. 

Obviously I have a bit of bias towards Israel and I acknowledge that but I am wondering if I am way off base in my thinking?",wonwonwo,375,0.5899999737739563,1227,1703802210,2023-12-28 16:23:30,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18t6eoz/cmv_the_majority_of_people_supporting_palestine/,12,2023
18tm874,CMV: Disney Plus will go down as the worst financial decision Disney has ever made.,"In 2019, Disney released a bunch of movies that all did really well in the Box Office, including Avengers Endgame, Frozen 2, Star Wars 9,  Toy Story 4. The 8 highest grossing films in the US/Canada that year were all Disney films. That was done intentionally to bring people's attention to Disney Plus, their new streaming platform. As it grew quarter to quarter, this product did really well over the pandemic. There wasn't much box office revenue either so this streaming platform became an important lifeline for Disney.

Unfortunately, the content Disney was releasing just wasn't good, probably due to a more significant budget constraint. People got tired and exhausted with Disney content, even in their flagship like Marvel. This resulted in 2023, the year of the flops. Disney can only claim financial success in 2 films this year, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and The Little Mermaid. Everything else was a flop. It wouldn't be a surprise if Disney reports a net loss of $1 billion at the box office this year. Their audience is conditioned to watch Disney content on their platform, and worse yet, conditioned to think that all Disney content is bad, in cinemas or not. It's also this year that their subscriber numbers have plateaued, in combination with an announcement to release ad-tier subscriptions and cut content.

18h1wdx,cmv: I am against all Religious states- Separation of Church and State is essential,"The separation of Church and State is not an attack on religious beliefs but a safeguard for the diverse and pluralistic nature of modern societies- Countries should NOT alter or add laws to cater for any religious beliefs.   


Mandating secular governance, especially in the context of religious law, protects individual rights, and is necessary in society. Any religious  law is based on the interpretation of religious scriptures. Governments cannot be founded on a subjective belief. The lack of a standardization in interpretations is bound to result in ambiguity and inconsistency in legal rulings, making it impossible to establish a cohesive legal framework.   
Mandating adherence to a specific belief inherently restricts peoples agency and free choice. Every individual should have the autonomy to form their own beliefs, values, and moral convictions without coercion from the state.

>Article 49 of the 4th Geneva Convention is very specific in its reference to settlers or civilians of the occupying Power and states explicitly that ""the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. ""This article prohibits settlements in broad and unequivocal terms without regard to the purported purposes of the settlements and was created specifically to prevent the colonization that inevitably ensues with such population transfers

The General Assembly, including the UK and many in the West, has condemned the illegality of these settlements numerous times, the Security Council [passed a resolution](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/1696?ln=en) in 1979 declaring that these settlements have no legal validity, and the ICJ has [ruled](https://web.archive.org/web/20200913105418/https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/131/131-20040709-ADV-01-00-EN.pdf) that the settlements violate international law, rendering them illegal. 

If anyone wants to argue that the West Bank is not occupied territory, both ICJ and [UNSC](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/SCRes242%281967%29.pdf) have ruled territories East of the Green Line to be occupied territory, and the rulings in the paragraph above presupposes West Bank as occupied territories too.

There is also [settler violence](https://www.btselem.org/topic/settler_violence) that Israel has failed to properly address, [doubly illegal settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_outpost) (illegal in Israeli law and international law) are not removed promptly and sometimes protected by the IDF. 

These are all unjustified because they come at the expense of Palestinians, forcing them into an apartheid-like state, an obstacle for peace (as described by the US), and often leads to unnecessary arrests of Palestinians for retaliating against settler violence.

If the USA doesn't want to be hypocritical, they must unequivocally condemn Israel for illegal settlements, just as many countries in the West have done. It's not like it will hinder their ability to send military aid to Israel anyway because the UK have also made military deals with Israel.

Edit: To clarify, declaring something illegal is not the same as condemning. Looking at the annexation of Crimea, many non-align countries declare the annexation and referendum illegal, or saying Ukraine's territorial integrity must be respected, but stop short of condemning Russia for it, because condemnation means something in diplomacy. If US condemns Israel tomorrow, for literally anything, it will permanently shift US-Israel relation because US has crossed a line that Israel didn't think they would cross.",GoSouthCourt,352,0.6399999856948853,435,1703542046,2023-12-25 16:07:26,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qsasj/cmv_the_israeli_settlements_are_illegal_and/,12,2023
18hsqgi,CMV: Bitcoin is a Ponzi and currency for questionable purchases and any promised utility is only used to inflate its price.,"I’m all for blockchain technology. I think it’s neat and I do understand crypto, I’ve been using Bitcoin since 2010, and I have researched all of it almost obsessively during the Covid bull run and ultimately keep coming back to the same conclusion.

Bitcoin is worthless.

Sure, some countries with unhinged leaders are trying to switch to it, and yes, it does help some people in Africa who don’t have banking access still have a currency to use, but those are extremely niche examples and don’t work well with something as volatile as Bitcoin in the long run.

It’s also incredibly deflationary by nature which only sounds good in theory but every lost wallet is just Bitcoin that is removed from the supply forever. No one can add more Bitcoin to the network to stimulate any type of economic growth.

The network is slow and relies on WAY too much energy to run. It’s impractical for day to day purchases and it can’t be a real currency until everyone accepts it, which is highly speculative.

As a worldwide store of value, the entire world would have to agree that it is worth something. I agree it’s easier to store than gold but it’s still reliant on a functioning network to run. If some apocalyptic event knocks out the grid, your bitcoin will still technically be there, but accessing it or trading it will be impossible.

You can use it to buy questionable shit on the internet, but that’s about the only purpose it ever had for me.

Every single crypto investor is doing it for one reason. They think it’ll make them rich. Which means they are buying it now, to sell to someone for more later. That makes it a Ponzi. Eventually someone is going to get stuck with the hot potato.

Big institutions are buying up the lions share of it. People like Michael Saylor and the Winklevoss Twins will be trillionaires if it actually takes off and everyone will have scraps of scraps. That’s not the economic equalizer. That’s the same wealth hoarding we already have amplified by a million.

My theory is big institutions are making their bitcoin plays and creating hype just so they can cash out on retail investors leaving the casuals high and dry. Or just keeping it going forever as a Ponzi they can manipulate whenever they need to generate wealth for themselves.",donniedenier,349,0.7599999904632568,445,1702505587,2023-12-13 16:13:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18hsqgi/cmv_bitcoin_is_a_ponzi_and_currency_for/,12,2023
18bcyto,"CMV: The best time to let a child know that they were adopted is at a very young age, not waiting until their teens or 20s to do so.","*Note: All of this assumes, of course, that the child resembles the adopting family closely enough that he/she might have believed/assumed that the parents were the biological parents. If the child is of a different race, then obviously there is no need to have ""the talk"" since the child couldn't possibly not know.*

If a child is told from as early as they can understand that they were adopted (as opposed to the parents being the biological parents) then they will have less adjustment issues. They will have known all along, and it will have been their reality all along.

By contrast, it can be devastating when some well-meaning parents wait until the kid is in the teens or 20s (or even later) to reveal the news that they were adopted. The rationale that is often given is something like, *""Well, we wanted to wait until he/she was of a mature enough old age to understand, to break the news.""*

The problem with waiting that long to break the news is that by that point the kid has long built up a foundation of concrete assumptions - believing all alone that the parents were the real biological parents - and then, when they've lived with that basis/assumption for so long, you suddenly kick out the foundations from underneath them and make them realize that they'd been on the wrong assumption for 16, 17 or 20 years, causing them to question everything. That shocking news can crash them, especially considering that adolescence or young adulthood is often a time when people are dealing with many hormonal/stressful/tough-social issues to begin with.

18ll8cq,CMV: It is not unethical of me to pirate a game I have already paid for on another platform.,"Paying full price for a game on one platform should give me this ability to play on another. I am not buying a physical product, I am buying a rights to play a game that I’ve paid for. I should be able to source the game without paying for it again to play on another platform. Paying twice for me to play the same game on 2 platforms is not fair.  
  
I can play the game twice on PlayStation for $79.99, but if I want to play once on PS and once on PC I am obliged to pay $159.98.  
  
Windows games seem to allow cross platform licenses which I consider ethical. This should be, from a morality standpoint, the fair way.  
  
Having to pay double to cross platform is unethical and as I result I should not feel bad for pirating said game.",Majestic_Ad1870,333,0.8500000238418579,256,1702937733,2023-12-18 16:15:33,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ll8cq/cmv_it_is_not_unethical_of_me_to_pirate_a_game_i/,12,2023
18edcan,CMV: Racism within minorities in the US is being ignored and is a huge problem.,"The caste system from India is alive and well in the United States. Some of it is brutal. Most of it is hidden and systemic (who gets hired and promoted).

There is discrimination against East Asians. Some of it is the black on Asian violence you see on TV.  But most of it again is hidden where Indian educators discriminate against East Asians by singling them out in school between Kindergarten and College.

East Asians discriminate against brown people and black people. Some of it is blatant like suspecting black customers of stealing. Most of it is done silently, by purposely avoiding black and brown communities, and they do not get called out in the same way white flight does.

DEI programs at companies are disproportionately run by black executives and focus on BIPOC, a term that has come to exclude brown and East Asian people.

Chinese and Koreans and Japanese are in a three way hate triangle. East Asians look down on Southeast Asians and consider them second class.

And so on.

The white majority rightfully gets called out if they do similar things, but minorities are able to fly under the radar. 

Unfortunately, it’s a huge problem that will and currently already does create winners and losers.",PuzzleheadedWatch953,324,0.800000011920929,185,1702127589,2023-12-09 07:13:09,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18edcan/cmv_racism_within_minorities_in_the_us_is_being/,12,2023
