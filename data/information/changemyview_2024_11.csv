1gtmuou,"CMV: When you sexualize yourself to get attention, you shouldn't be surprised when the attention you receive is sexual","To me this sounds kinda like a ""duh"" take but but apparently some people disagree so I want some insight to shift my view. I'll use women in this example, but i think it applies to men as well.

I'll use the example of Instagram. I absolutely can't stand it now because EVERYTHING is made sexual and it's a bit predatory in my opinion because creators almost FORCE you to view them by gaming the algorithm. One thing I think IG user will come across is a woman who will be making very basic content like describing a news story or telling a trending joke. But the woman makes sure to perfectly position herself where her cleavage is visible because that's usually the only thing in her content that is actually of 'value'.  You see this a lot with IG comedians where the joke is ""sex"" or ""look at my ass/tits"". Like if you watch gym videos you've probably stumbled across one of the many female creators who use gym equipment to do something sexual and the joke is ""Haha sex"". 

But then, as expected, the comments will be split between peopple (usually men) sexualizing the creator and people (usually women) shaming the men for sexualizing her and being ""porn addicted"". But what really do you expect? When you sexualize yourself it shouldn't be a surprise when the attention you get is sexual. And I think that applies to all situations both in real life and online.

Now what I normally see in the comment is the argument that ""well she's a woman and that's just her body. She's not sexualizing it you are"". But I think this is just a cop out that takes away personal responsibility, assumes the women are too dumb to understand how they are presenting themselves and that the viewer is too dumb to have common sense. 

I also think America is so over hypersexualized that people will go out dressing like a stripper and be baffled when they're viewed as such. So yeah pretty much my view is the title that when you oversexualize yourself, it should be a surprise when the attention you get is sexual.

1glymqm,"CMV: As a European, I find the attitude of Americans towards IDs (and presenting one for voting) irrational.","As a European, my experience with having a national ID is described below:

The state expects (requires) that I have an ID card by the age of 12-13. The ID card is issued by the police and contains basic information (name, address, DoB, citizenship) and a photo.

I need to present my ID when:

* I visit my doctor
* I pick up a prescription from the pharmacy
* I open a bank account
* I start at a new workplace
* I vote
* I am asked by the police to present it
* I visit any ""state-owned service provider"" (tax authority, DMV, etc.)
* I sign any kind of contract

Now, I understand that the US is HUGE, and maybe having a federal-issued ID is unfeasible. However, what would be the issue with each state issuing their own IDs which are recognized by the other states? This is what we do today in Europe, where I can present my country's ID to another country (when I need to prove my identity).

Am I missing something major which is US-specific?

1gkdy23,CMV: the stigma around men discussing their feelings is caused just as much by women as men,"My friend and I got into a disagreement over the weekend with our girl friends around the problems of men’s mental health. Their argument was that men don’t feel comfortable talking about their feelings because of the patriarchy that they have established. They argue that men self-impose toxic masculinity and this prevents them from expressing themselves fully. 

We responded by saying that women don’t want to listen to men’s problems. Their response was that women’s issues are more important because they have been historically wronged by society. The basic contention they proposed was that women face more oppression and a slew of issues fighting against the patriarchal society that we would never be able to understand. 

The underlying claim in their argument was that therefore men’s issues aren’t as deep or significant. To me, this literally proved our point that women tend to trivialize men’s problems.

1gst4rz,"CMV: Egypt will collapse, and it will trigger the largest refugee crisis in human history","I believe that Egypt is heading for a catastrophic collapse that will lead to the largest refugee wave we've ever seen. This isn't speculation—it's rooted in harsh realities of demography, food security, and economic pressures.

First, let's talk numbers: Egypt's population has exploded over recent decades, reaching over 110 million people. Projections show that this growth is not slowing down. The population continues to rise, while the country is running out of land to sustain it. Egypt already imports more than half of its food, and they are the world's largest wheat importer. Rising food prices, global supply chain issues, and instability in global markets leave Egypt extremely vulnerable to supply shocks.

Water scarcity is another massive factor. The Nile River, which Egypt relies on for 97% of its water, is under increasing stress from climate change and upstream development, particularly Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam. Egypt has a limited capacity to adapt, and water shortages will only exacerbate food insecurity.

Politically and economically, Egypt faces significant instability. The regime under President el-Sisi has been maintaining order through a combination of subsidies and repression, but this is unsustainable. Rising economic pressure on the poorest citizens, compounded by inflation, energy crises, and unemployment, will create widespread unrest.

When (not if) Egypt's stability breaks, it will trigger a massive outflow of refugees, mainly toward Europe and neighboring countries. We are talking about millions of people moving due to famine, water scarcity, and political collapse. If we look at the Syrian Civil War and the refugee crisis that followed, it pales in comparison to what could happen here.

This isn't just a humanitarian crisis in waiting; it's a geopolitical time bomb that will reshape borders, cause international tensions, and strain global systems. The signs are all there, and ignoring them won't make this looming disaster go away.",Ok_Yellow1,1394,0.9100000262260437,338,1731780487,2024-11-16 12:08:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gst4rz/cmv_egypt_will_collapse_and_it_will_trigger_the/,11,2024

This is not a good justification for not voting, because there are [many more issues](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-trump-stance-issues-policies-president-race-rcna150570) at stake.

1giv72i,CMV: There is no such thing as an ethical billionaire.,"This is a pretty simple stance. I feel that, because it's impossible to acquire a billion US dollars without exploiting others, anyone who becomes a billionaire is inherently unethical. 

If an ethical person were on their way to becoming a billionaire, he or she would 1) pay their workers more, so they could have more stable lives; and 2) see the injustice in the world and give away substantial portions of their wealth to various causes to try to reduce the injustice before they actually become billionaires. 

In the instance where someone inherits or otherwise suddenly acquires a billion dollars, an ethical person would give away most of it to righteous causes, meaning that person might be a temporary ethical billionaire - a rare and brief exception.

Therefore, a billionaire (who retains his or her wealth) cannot be ethical. 

Obviously, this argument is tied to the current value of money, not some theoretical future where virtually everyone is a billionaire because of rampant inflation.",jrice441100,1317,0.6800000071525574,1773,1730662648,2024-11-03 13:37:28,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1giv72i/cmv_there_is_no_such_thing_as_an_ethical/,11,2024
1h2li68,CMV: Authors Have No Obligation to Make Their Fiction Morally Perfect,"I’ve seen criticism directed at J.K. Rowling for her portrayal of house elves in Harry Potter, particularly the fact that they remain slaves and don’t get a happy ending. I think it’s completely valid for an author to create a grim, imperfect world without feeling obligated to resolve every injustice.

Fiction is a form of creative expression, and authors don’t owe readers a morally sanitized or uplifting narrative. A story doesn’t have to reflect an idealized world to have value it can challenge us by showing imperfections, hardships, or unresolved issues. The house elves in Harry Potter are a reflection of the flawed nature of the wizarding world, which itself mirrors the inequalities and blind spots of our own society.

Expecting authors to “fix” everything in their stories risks turning fiction into a checklist of moral obligations rather than a creative exploration of themes. Sometimes the lack of resolution or the depiction of an unjust system is what makes a story compelling and thought-provoking.

Ultimately, authors should have the freedom to paint their worlds as grim or dark as they want without being held to a standard of moral responsibility.

1god8ad,CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding.,"My fiance and I live in a state that legalized same-sex marriage in 2010, when we had a Democratic governor and Democratic majorities in both our State House and State Senate.

Currently, as of last week's election, it is confirmed that our state will have a Republican governor, and a Republican majority in the State Senate; once all the votes are counted, it is all but guaranteed that Republicans will have a majority in the State House as well.

Our state's Republican Party's platform, as listed on their website,, states that their goal is to, ""recognize marriage as the legal and sacred union between one man and one woman as ordained by God, encouraged by the State, and traditional to humankind, and the core of the Family."" This is dated to April 13, 2024 - it's not an obsolete or outdated policy point for them.

At a national level, a 2024 Gallup Poll showed that only 46% of Republicans believe that same-sex marriages should be recognized by the law as valid. As in our state, the results of last week's election have given us a Republican president, a Republican Senate, and as it stands currently, a very high chance of a Republican House. 

Conveniently, Republicans now also hold a majority on the Supreme Court. In his concurring opinion on the Dobbs case in 2022, Clarence Thomas stated that the court, ""should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell"" - with Obergefell being the case that required the entire nation to recognize and perform same-sex marriages.

In summary: while it's not set in stone quite yet, there is a very distinct chance that, at some point in the next four years, we will become unable to legally marry in our home state, and unable to gain the financial and legal benefits of marriage if we were to have it performed in another state or country.

Because of this looking threat to our rights, we are planning on going to City Hall to get a marriage certificate sometime before the end of the year. At some point further down the road, we can hold a symbolic ceremony and reception, no matter the political situation at the time (we had been putting this off for cost purposes anyways).

When it comes to our guest list, I feel completely justified in instructing our potential guests that, if they have voted for political candidates who belong to the party that threatens our right to marry in the most recent election, then we ask that they do not attend our marriage. I cannot stomach the thought of enabling their hypocrisy, specifically their ability to perform acts that harm us one day, then show up to congratulate us and share in our joy the best day.

While we haven't outright asked everyone on our drafted guest list who they have voted for, it appears that this request would mean that at least, my mother, my grandmother, and many aunts, uncles, and cousins on my fiance's side would be asked to decline their invitations. I am fine with my mother and grandmother not attending, as my father and most of my siblings would be there, and I know that my fiance's mother and brother would be there as well.

My fiance states that, should I make this request, the resultant family drama on his side would be so tumultuous that it would tear the family apart, and he would never hear the end of it until everyone requested not to attend had passed away.

It is worth noting that, prior to my coming up with the idea of this request, his side of the family occupied about three times more of the drafted guest list than my side - he has offered a similar justification that choosing to invite some but not all of his family would cause too much drama. Meanwhile, I had only ever intended to invite my nuclear family, my one surviving grandmother, and the aunt/uncle/cousins that live closest by that I am on the best terms with.

So, what do you think? Is it worth causing ""family drama"" in order to take a stand against hypocrisy? Should I, instead, grin and bear the unwanted presence at our wedding of those who voted against our right to marry?",BosomsaurusRex,1287,0.7200000286102295,910,1731278810,2024-11-10 16:46:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1god8ad/cmv_i_am_justified_in_not_inviting_family_members/,11,2024
1gykzg9,CMV: No single person should be able to possess a net worth of more than 1 billion dollars.,"Considering the fact that in the United States (for instance), the three richest individuals control more wealth than the bottom 50% of the entire country, or the fact that the richest 1% of the global population control more wealth than the other 99% combined, I take the position that no individual should possess more than 1 billion dollars.

Please consider the following points before commenting:

1. The currency domination isn't important (it could be euros, yen, or whatever), but using USD as a benchmark.

2. A married couple could possess 2 billion dollars, so lets eliminate that argument at the start.

3. Choosing 1 billion is subjective, it could be 5 billion, or 500 million. I am picking this number to demonstrate that I have no problems with capitalism, nor am I advocating for communism, or that I don't acknowledge that societies in general will always have wealth inequality. 

4. I do hope this doesn't end up being an echo chamber, because part of this position does seem a bit 'obvious.' 

5. I don't have some great answer for how a redistribution would work, however, I don't necessarily think this should be a reason to not do it.

1gk33fs,CMV: Islamophobia is not irrational,"First off, I’m not interested in comparing Islam to other religions in this post, this discussion is only about Islam, so please keep comments focused on that.

For context, I grew up in Iran around Shia Muslims. Most of the people around me identified as Muslim in name, but many didn’t strictly follow the religion, and some even despised it. Personally, I hold a very critical view of Islam.

From my perspective, Islam promotes outdated, unhealthy, and often bigoted ideas. While I know not all Muslims follow these beliefs to the letter, these aspects are deeply rooted in the ideology. A few examples I find concerning:

* Islam often promotes misogynistic beliefs that limit women’s freedom.
* It teaches intolerance towards homosexuals and apostates.
* It encourages violence against its enemies and places a strong emphasis on martyrdom and military supremacy.
* The goal of Islam, as stated in its texts, is to dominate the world as the true religion.

With these factors in mind, I think a critical view or even fear of Islam isn’t irrational.

1go56j6,CMV: “educate yourself” is the intellectual version of “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” and is elitist,"In my opinion, your worldview is not something you “build yourself with your own two hands” it’s largely given to you.  This is why there are liberal areas where liberal families live and raise liberal kids, same with conservatives.  

I can’t stand people with their self righteous “educate yourself” BS.  These people act like they get up at the 4 am every day to read everything under the sun to make sure they choose the correct moral stance on a given issue, and anyone who hasn’t looked into it or come to the right conclusion is less than.  It’s honestly pathetic and it’s pure mental bias.  

A lot of you might be surprised to see how you would have voted, for instance, if you had come from deep conservative territory.  

It’s especially frustrating because half of the “high moral ground” that many of my leftist contemporaries claim is that they are EMPATHETIC TOWARDS PEOPLE.  My leftist contemporaries have sympathy for the issues that come with poverty in cities but if you’re broke and from the country and you didn’t vote blue, you’re a piece of shit.  It’s ridiculous.  

If someone comes from an area with deep ideology and is able to reject that culture and worldview and build their own, because they disagree with it, that’s amazing and those people should be commended, but people who can’t do that (vast majority of people) should not be demonized.  

If you are proud of your worldview and you think it makes you a better person, believe me you are lucky to have it and it’s a gift.  You didn’t work for it and no one owes you applause, and you’re dead wrong to make villains of people less fortunate.

1gvch39,"CMV: Male circumcision is wrong, but calling circumcised men ""mutilated"" or implying that they are sexually dysfunctional is also wrong.","Basically, my understanding of the issue of male circumcision is that it is a bad thing, but only mildly so.  

There are statistically low risks of surgical complications, and even lower statistical risk that the complications could result in serious long-term problems.  The only studies that I have seen that claim that circumcised men experience more sexual dissatisfaction, discomfort or dysfunction, are based on online survey results which have low N counts and would suffer from confirmation bias.  The most convincing studies I have seen that are based on meta-analyses and medical data find that circumcised men are not more likely to suffer from sexual dysfunction or dissatisfaction than uncircumcised men.  

The trade-off is the purported hygiene and STD preventing effects of circumcision, which I understand to be questionable at best, and perhaps more applicable to countries where hygiene practices and conditions are not great. 

On the balance, it's not a good practice and it should definitely be discouraged, maybe even banned.  Especially when you factor in more abstract and unproven concerns, like the possible psychological impact on infants and just the abstract point of losing sexual sensitivity relative to uncircumcised men.

All of that being said, I don't think it is either logically accurate or rhetorically effective to describe male circumcision as a form of mutilation, or to imply in any way that circumcised men are sexually dysfunctional.  

I think the word ""mutilation"" implies that there are malicious and/or medically-arbitrary (e.g. purely cultural) *intentions* behind male circumcision, and also that the harm done is severe and debilitating.  I do not think that implication rings true.  I think most parents still believe that the hygiene/STD prevention reasons are valid, and a lot of doctors also don't know well enough to disabuse them of this notion.  And even if the parents due it purely for cultural reasons, as discussed above, the risks and harms of circumcision are relatively minor - parents wouldn't do it otherwise.  

I also think that telling parents that they are ""mutilators"" and circumcised men that they have been ""mutilated"" is unconvincing.  You are using more extreme rhetoric thinking that the fact that it is more extreme means it will have more of an impact, but really that extreme rhetoric just makes the whole position seem unrealistic.  

Especially when it comes to circumcised fathers, who are usually the ones to push for circumcision more than the mothers.  Tell a circumcised father that they have been mutilated and that their son's dick isn't going to work, and they will laugh in your face - because, of course they never considered themselves to be ""mutilated"", and of course they never had problems with their own dick working.  

Tell parents instead ""there's really no benefit to doing this, and there are some pretty severe downsides on the rare chance that it goes wrong"" - and they will be much, much more likely to be convinced.  Not to mention that you are actually telling them the truth, which is always better than lying to people via hyperbole.

1gingrk,"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child.","Academically, even with access to curriculum supports, almost all parents are going to struggle to provide a comprehensive education in all subjects to the level a public school would. Even if the parent has a strong academic background, they will be missing elements of other subjects or of pedagogy in general. They may struggle to fully identify progress or gaps in learning that go on to multiply in the subsequent years.  
  
Beyond academics, a key function of school is the social aspect - to expose young children to their peers and social scenarios both positive and negative for them to navigate in preparation for adulthood. You can try to supplement this with playgroups, team sports, etc. to some extent, but you're not going to replicate the nature or frequency of school relationships.

Finally, the fact that the majority of their peers will have these common experiences will leave them perpetually feeling like an outsider, even once school is well behind them.

All of the above leads to believe homeschooled students are being done a disadvantage by parents who insist on it, usually for self-serving, insular reasons, or to ensure they are not taught aspects of the curriculum they disagree with.

1gk7ekw,CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism,"I feel like a lot of left-wingers are stuck in the mindset, that Non-Western cultures are inherently less oppressive and more free than Western cultures, even though they are much more conservative than Western ones. American right-wing Christians have much more in common with Conservative Muslims than they think, compared to Atheist Progressive people. It is just they use the same tactics in controlling societies, but they happened to be in different teams.

It is just happened, that Non-Western traditionalists don’t have political power to have influence in Western politics and install their supremacy, so they fall into the category of oppressed ones, however the left-wingers fail to realize, that they are not their ideological allies. In fact they will oppose Western equality until they will have the right to install their rules. 

I have no idea, how Western societies can tolerate their traditionalism as the culture, if it is inherently oppressive. For the same rules we can perceive culture of some hardcore weird Christian sects of Deep South, like Quiverfull, their own culture, but we are aware, that this Deep Southerner Christian culture is really bad for USA as a whole and it would be better, if it was disbanded. I am aware, sone of y’all will say, that they don’t have a culture etc, however mostly it is political instrument to fight against these cultures rather than a correct statement (I also hate Christianity too).

Especially, i see this problem with Non-Western men rather than with Non-Western women. Non-Western women actually care about relationships between different groups and collective callout of bigotry, while retaining their culture in more ecological ways, while Non-Western men tend to be hypocrites in using only anti-racist rhetoric against White racists (who they actually share most of core beliefs with, but they are in different teams), while actively participating in sexism and homophobia, defending their actions with “muh these are our traditions” shield.

You either are a patriot that supports western values, or you are *not* a patriot and support fascism. Being a patriot means you’re proud of your country and your countries values. In the United States, our values mainly consist of equality, diversity, freedom, democracy, and equal opportunity, just to name a few. 

If you call yourself an american patriot, it means that you are proud of these values that your country holds. If you’re proud of equality, why are you supporting a foreign dictator who doesn’t believe in equality? Members of the LGBTQ community are terribly persecuted in Russia, and the majority of russians support laws discriminating against the gay community. Freedom?

If you sympathize with Putin, you don’t believe in any of those things. So you don’t actually care about American values.

Equal opportunity? Simply doesn’t exist in Russia. 

There are so many Americans sympathizing with or even idolizing Putin, and they claim to be American patriots. Most of these people are among the MAGA crowd of course, but not all of them.

I believe culture is the very essence of humanity. however i don’t believe ALL cultures deserve to be respected and tolerated. some examples of cultural practices i’ve come across that i will never personally tolerate or understand:

1. women who leave marriages should walk out with the clothes on their backs and nothing else. this happens close to where i live. as a woman, if uou choose to leave your marriage for whatever reason, you don’t get to keep ANYTHING in the house with your husband. not even your clothes and personal belongings.

2. forced marriage. no no no NO. i don’t even need to explain myself for this. 

3. brides drinking water off their husband’s feets. if you’re on instagram reels a lot you’ll know what i mean. disgusting and degrading towards the woman.

1gly6bc,CMV: Terms Like 'Incel' Prove That We Reduce People's Worth to Sexual Success,"Let’s start with the term “incel,” which often reduces a person’s value to whether they succeed in the dating world. I think this is a narrow view. After all, it overlooks bigger struggles, like isolation and the lack of meaningful relationships, which are real issues. When we focus only on sexual success, we miss the chance to understand deeper emotional needs and human dignity.

Indeed, not all men who identify as “incels” (or are labeled as such) see others as mere objects for sex. However, the culture around the term often promotes (and proves) a transactional view of relationships, where human connections are reduced to something that validates someone’s identity. In my opinion, this directly takes away from the true depth and respect that relationships should have.

Of course, misogyny, toxic masculinity, and objectifying women are serious problems, no doubt. But I think the bigger issue is that society struggles to understand human dignity. We need to see each other as whole, multi-dimensional people, not as objects to conquer or manipulate. Respect should come from this deeper recognition.

Yeah, relationships are naturally complicated, and we all want intimacy and connection. But they shouldn’t be seen as transactions, where someone’s worth is based only on what they can give in return.

In the end, I believe that sexual success should never define a person’s worth or the health of a relationship. So, when society overemphasises it, we set up unrealistic expectations, frustration, and lose sight of the emotional bonds that make relationships last.

Consequently, societal expectations impact relationships, but we need spaces where people can connect authentically, without pressure to meet shallow standards. The goal isn’t to eliminate all expectations but to shift the focus away from appearances or sexual success and make room for genuine, meaningful connections.",borisdandorra,673,0.6399999856948853,732,1731006127,2024-11-07 13:02:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gly6bc/cmv_terms_like_incel_prove_that_we_reduce_peoples/,11,2024
1gvof1v,CMV: Pedo hunters/ Vigilantes are NOT doing the right thing ,"
You know, the videos on social media going viral of “pedo hunters” luring men in and then proceeding to humiliate them in public/ beat them and 9/10, they don’t even call the police. So what’s the point of even luring them out if you’re not even going to call the police and report them? Any reason you can think of just leads to these pedo hunters getting some sort of gain/satisfaction from it, and not that they actually care about stopping pedos. If they actually cared about stopping it, they’d have the person arrested instead of just humiliating them and then letting them go to potentially do the same again. 

1: They go viral 
2: They have an excuse to physically assault someone without legal consequences, because they know these guys they’re assaulting won’t call the police because of what they’re being accused of could also get them arrested 
3: They get to look like “hero’s” for beating up a dude who is accused of trying to meet up with children. 

Let me make myself clear, i have absolutely no sympathy for pedophiles. I wish they’d all just drop off the face of the earth. However, this affects much more than just the men caught in these stings. It affects their wives if they have one, their children, their siblings, their family. Anyone closely associated with this person who goes viral will be humiliated aswell. 

Not to mention, some men in this situation actually didn’t know the person was underage until they were already at the meet up location: 

https://amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/25/vigilante-paedophile-hunters-online-police

Some have died 

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/world/europe/netherlands-pedophile-hunters.html

Either call the police immediately after luring these men out, or sit back and let the police catch them themselves. This whole “look at me i’m a hero because i just beat up a guy and shaved his head and made him eat dog food because he tried to meet a 15 year old boy” isn’t justice, it’s just unnecessary violence. Besides, it isn’t their place to deliver justice, it’s a judges place.

1gr1tbe,CMV: It isn't hyperbolic for the west to be worried about the rise of fascism,"Like clockwork, economic downturn inevitably leads to populists using minorities and migrants as cultural scapegoats to solve economic problems - and in turn disillusioned citizens become increasingly disgruntled with existing political structures. It's a fertile space for authoritarian leaders to promise swift and easy solutions to complex questions.

The Great Depression and the post-WW1 economy spurred the rise of the Nazis, Mussolini's Fascist Party and Franco’s Dictatorship.

Here in the UK movements like the BUF, National Front and now arguably UKIP/Reform have bubbled up during The Great Depression, Stagflation and the various modern financial crises respectively.

Even eastwards, while not strictly a fascist state, the dissolution of the Soviet Union opened the door in Russia for far-right, nationalist and authoritarian movements that still maintain power to this day.

It's not hard to draw comparisons between these examples and our contemporary lay of the land. We know the economy isn't ideal for most people right now. We know it's the highest concern for most of a given electorate. We know that minorities and immigrants are being touted as the solution to many of those concerns. We know that sadly, a great deal of those solutions are veering into dehumanization and will only continue to do so while populists continue to win support.

I don't believe we're standing right at the doors of fascism at this very moment and I basically believe many of our institutions can withstand authoritarian power grabs for the time being. But it's my view that a worst-case scenario of a western fascist state - or a fascist movement with a lot of support - is an increasingly possible reality that its pretty reasonable to actively worry and talk about.",hotdog_jones,609,0.699999988079071,721,1731579850,2024-11-14 04:24:10,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gr1tbe/cmv_it_isnt_hyperbolic_for_the_west_to_be_worried/,11,2024

1gp868o,CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective. (At least in the States),"Now I imagine most people already know what the 4B movement is. For those that don't, it is a movement started by women in South Korea where women will be celibate, not get married, not have kids and not have sex with men. Sex strikes are just the latter part.

Now, this concerns the United States, South Korea I've heard plenty of horror stories regarding systemic sexism and thus can understand why those women perform this movement, but its strange when looking at the states.

1. Conservative men are typically very Religious, they not only preach against hookup culture but support celibacy for women and are extremely anti abortion. The 4B movement is everything they want out of women by preventing more abortions and not having sex outside of marriage.

2. Conservative men are not going to go out with more left leaning women who do not share their values, most of these men despise feminists and they have no problem with women they have no interest in not dating them.

3. No Conservative man wants left leaning women to procreate, why would they want more people in future generations to challenge their values instead of populating the future with children who subscribe to their views.

4. This hurts liberal men. Men who are feminists or are sympathetic to these women are far more likely to date and marry the women in these movements, and thus they are hurt by this movement, while nothing changes for conservative men.

In general, it seems like the 4B movement is self defeating and gives conservative men exactly what they want while hurting both left leaning men and women.

1gvw1rk,CMV: Modern Politics is no longer Left/Right but Up/Down on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,"Modern politics is no longer represented by Left/Right, but instead by Up/Down on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Those needs are portrayed in the shape of a pyramid, as an individual's most basic needs must be satisfied before working towards higher-level needs. The levels are the following, starting from the bottom:

1. Physiological needs
2. Safety needs
3. Belongingness & Love needs
4. Esteem needs
5. Self-actualisation

Currently, based on the issues that Left/Right-wing parties identify with, it's possible to observe a shift from traditional economic/ideological divides towards a division based on different levels of Maslow's hierarchy.

Right-wing parties generally prioritise issues related to the lower levels of the hierarchy, such as Physiological needs (economic stability, food prices, gas prices) and Safety needs (crime, immigration control, self-defence). 

Left-wing parties, on the other hand, prioritise issues related to the higher levels of the hierarchy, such as Belongingness needs (diversity, equality, inclusion), Esteem needs (social justice, representation in media) and Self-actualisation (activism, environmental sustainability).

This is also the reason why a lot of people on either side are unable to comprehend the issues that matter to the other side. If you have to satisfy your Basic needs (Physiological & Safety), you will find Psychological needs (Belongingness, Esteem) to be irrelevant to your current situation, as they're luxuries you can't afford. On the other hand, if you have your Basic needs satisfied already, you'll consider (moderate) increases in prices and a (general) decrease in safety quite irrelevant, as it doesn't affect you that much personally.",Security_Breach,554,0.6899999976158142,388,1732126417,2024-11-20 12:13:37,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gvw1rk/cmv_modern_politics_is_no_longer_leftright_but/,11,2024
1gl5345,"CMV: Most reddit mods are biased and remove/leave content which they personally disagree/agree with, despite it violating/not violating the rules of the subreddit.","Alright, let’s talk about something I’ve noticed happening on Reddit.   
  
Moderators there are supposed to be impartial, right? They’re tasked with enforcing rules fairly, keeping things balanced, and making sure discussions stay open for everyone. But lately, it seems like some moderators are letting personal beliefs influence what stays and what goes.   
  
They’re picking which posts stay visible based on whether they agree with them or not, which can feel unfair to a lot of users. Sometimes, posts that are technically against the rules are allowed to stay up if they fit a certain narrative. And other times, posts that don’t break any guidelines get removed because they don’t align with a particular perspective. This inconsistency in enforcement can lead to a sense of unfairness for a lot of users who feel like the playing field isn’t even.   
  
What I am seeing as a result is that Reddit is turning into more of an echo chamber in certain spaces. Many subreddits tend to show only one side of a conversation, one perspective. If you’ve got an opposing opinion, or you want to question the main views in those subs, it’s tough to have your voice heard.  


Take r/pics for example, we know that it got so much bad rep for political posts throughout the 2024 US Presidential Election cycle, I mean all of you who are active on that subreddit saw how we had 10s of posts everyday where embarrassing pictures regarding the two candidates were shared.   


But I saw that the posts which were against Donald Trump (Republicans) got 1000s of upvotes and comments. While the ones against the Democrats, got removed by mods there fairly quickly. Even though the posts did not break any rule.  
  
I believe this kind of moderation is harmful to free speech and people deserve a chance to share their perspectives in an open forum and feel confident that the rules are applied the same way to everyone.   
  
That said, I’m open to changing my mind on this. If there’s a valid reason why this approach to moderation is necessary or if someone can make a solid case for how it’s ultimately better for the community, I’m all ears. I’m not set in stone here—if there’s a perspective I haven’t considered, I’d genuinely like to hear it.",Embarrassed-Try4601,545,0.8500000238418579,311,1730917055,2024-11-06 12:17:35,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gl5345/cmv_most_reddit_mods_are_biased_and_removeleave/,11,2024

1goeneu,"CMV: Americans don’t realize how fortunate they are compared to most of the world.

","Hello guys! 



So, I’m a European, and I wanted to share an outsider's perspective on what I think of American life. I often hear Americans talk about their struggles, the “rat race” culture, healthcare costs, or the pressure to succeed. I get it—no place is perfect. But I sometimes wonder if people in the U.S. realize how much they actually have going for them, especially compared to most of the world.



From where I sit, the U.S. has so many advantages that are easy to take for granted. For instance:



\*\*Higher Salaries and Access to Resources:\*\* When I see what many Americans make, even in entry-level jobs, it’s much higher than in a lot of European countries. It’s not unusual to find people earning really solid money in certain U.S. industries where those jobs just don’t pay as well here. And while the cost of living varies, the potential for income growth in the U.S. is immense.



\*\*Economic Dominance and Influence:\*\* The U.S. has an economy that’s massive on a global scale. American companies, innovations, and cultural exports dominate worldwide. That opens doors for people who might have an idea, product, or dream that could make it big. It’s a different playing field compared to what we have, where things are more stable but often slower and harder to scale.



\*\*Endless Opportunities:\*\* The “American Dream” may be a cliché, but I think there’s some truth in it. The diversity of landscapes, industries, and educational opportunities is unmatched. People from all around the world move to the U.S. specifically to chase opportunities. From Silicon Valley to Hollywood to Wall Street, there are specialized career paths that just don’t exist in other countries.



\*\*Power in Numbers and Influence:\*\* As a European, I see the influence of American culture, politics, and media constantly, even here. The U.S. has a massive cultural and political footprint, which can be frustrating at times, but there’s also power in it. Americans get to help set global trends and policies, and that gives people in the U.S. a voice and level of influence that few other countries have.



\*\*Innovation and Infrastructure:\*\* There’s a strong innovation culture in the U.S., with people who are ready to embrace change. Technology, entertainment, and business innovations often start there before going global. America has some impressive infrastructure, too, even if it doesn’t always seem that way to people living there. For example, you have massive universities with resources on a scale you rarely see anywhere else.



\*\*Social and Cultural Diversity:\*\* The U.S. is so vast and diverse, culturally and socially. I feel like people in the U.S. have endless opportunities to explore different lifestyles, perspectives, and hobbies that bring vibrancy to everyday life. You can meet people from almost every background and culture—something that is harder to find in many smaller, more homogenous countries.



\*\*Higher Education System and Research Opportunities:\*\* While the cost of college in the U.S. is famously high, the country still has some of the best universities and research facilities in the world. Graduating from an American university can open doors globally, and there's a level of innovation and funding in research that’s tough to match elsewhere. Many cutting-edge fields and technologies are pioneered there, making it a fantastic environment for academics and researchers.



\*\*Access to Vast Natural Beauty and Outdoor Activities:\*\* The diversity of landscapes in the U.S. is incredible. There’s everything from national parks and ski resorts to beaches and desert landscapes. Americans have access to some of the most spectacular natural beauty in the world, with the infrastructure and freedom to explore it relatively easily—often just a road trip away. That’s something many countries don’t offer in the same abundance or scale.



\*\*Job Mobility and Flexibility:\*\* In the U.S., it’s relatively common for people to switch jobs or move to different states in search of better opportunities. In many European countries, job markets are more stable but can also be restrictive. In America, people have a high degree of freedom to pursue different paths, start new careers, or move around, which can be both liberating and rewarding.



\*\*Advancements in Medicine and Cutting-Edge Healthcare:\*\* Despite the challenges with affordability, the U.S. is often at the forefront of medical advancements, from high-end surgeries to pioneering treatments for rare conditions. American hospitals and research institutions lead in many fields, and the country offers access to some of the world’s most advanced healthcare technology.



\*\*Consumer Variety and Convenience:\*\* Americans have access to an incredible range of products, often at lower prices compared to much of the world. The convenience culture, where many services are available 24/7, is also unique. Fast food, extensive shopping options, and rapid delivery services add convenience that isn’t as common or accessible elsewhere.



\*\*Support for Innovation and Startups:\*\* The “startup culture” is so deeply rooted in the U.S., and there’s infrastructure to back it up—incubators, venture capital funding, and an investor mindset that encourages people to try new things. People with entrepreneurial ambitions have a lot of resources, networks, and access to capital to help bring their ideas to life, something that’s often harder to come by in more traditional economies.



\*\*Strong Legal System and Individual Rights:\*\* Americans enjoy a high degree of personal freedom and strong protections for individual rights under the Constitution. Freedom of speech, the right to privacy, and legal protections for workers are more robust in the U.S. than in many countries. This legal infrastructure can create a sense of security and autonomy that’s valued by many.



\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Even with its issues, the U.S. has a lot going for it—economic opportunity, natural beauty, innovation, and freedoms that many people around the world dream of. As a European, I wonder if Americans appreciate just how fortunate they are to live in a place that offers so much.",RotenSquids,512,0.7799999713897705,304,1731282737,2024-11-10 17:52:17,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1goeneu/cmv_americans_dont_realize_how_fortunate_they_are/,11,2024

And no I’m not one of those “people should speak English here people” who gets mad at people for speaking another language to the people they’re with in public.

And I know people are going to say “America doesn’t have an official language” but most of the states do, do most people here would consider that our main language. 

I also think a lot of people protest this because they think American English speakers = white people and learning English is something white people want minorities who come here to do.

1gyeswl,CMV: Calling something “common sense” is not a valid argument.,"You are debating someone with a different viewpoint than you. You seem to disagree on fundamental issues. You ask why they believe what they do, and they respond “it’s just common sense.” How do you argue against that?

I see this way too often, where people seem to use the term common sense to justify their bigotry. Why? Because “common sense” can be used to describe things so arbitrarily. It is used to oversimplify more nuanced topics.

This isn’t a one sided issue, so I will give two examples, and keep in mind I’m not disagreeing with the arguments themselves:

- **Common Sense Gun Laws:** When you describe the gun laws as common sense, how is it so? Is it common sense to folks that are hunters and gun enthusiasts that believe that gun ownership is their right? This seems like a case where “common sense” is being used to prevent further conversation about solutions to an issue like gun violence.

- **Economic Policy:** A lot of times, people will argue that social programs shouldn’t exist or should be limited because “It’s common sense, you get money by working hard.” But is it common sense for the people that have used social programs to get back on their feet and provide them the opportunity to make a living? Like the last example, this argument takes away the nuance.

You can see how that term can be weaponized. It is a fallacy. It is used as an argument to evade providing actual evidence, and just resort to what they perceive as the reality.

1gzmh2l,CMV: Lying and exaggerating trumps rhetoric (or any rhetoric for that matter) only leads to more defenders of said rhetoric. ,"What I noticed a lot during this campaign was that people would say “look at what this person said” and you look at their comments and the actual tweet or Reddit post or news article you see is an interpretation of seemingly unrelated comments. I don’t know if I’m allowed to identify a subreddit here but there’s one particular page that is notorious for this. There was a whole thing about how Trump threatened Kamala supporters but he actually said something like “raise your hand actually don’t do that because it would be bad” at one of his rally’s which in reality is not a threat. It’s unprofessional and should not be coming from a presidential candidate but they made it seem worse than it was. The same rhetoric exists around abortion. Labeling anybody anti abortion as someone who wants to control women’s bodies when their reality could be that they genuinely believe it’s murder. I think when you say these things to make someone seem more extreme than they actually are then it makes people see the actual harm they bring to society in a less harmful way. They look like they’re being attacked. I always say, if you believe in something the truth should be enough to convince people Trump said plenty of terrible things and a lot of it is posted on his website. Weaponize his real words against him. When you build your defense around lies and exaggerations like all of the abortion stuff (which white women clearly don’t care about as much as they claim) some people will just defend the person who’s being lied on.

1gh8oh6,CMV: There is nothing inherently wrong with losing weight via Ozempic & similar drugs,"(this argument assumes there is no scarcity for the drug, and that me using it would not prevent others from having access to it or raise prices)

If the health issues due to obesity are greater than the side effects of ozempic then the patient should take ozempic. There has been a tremendous amount of hate for this drug from both extremes of the ""fatphobia"" spectrum. On one side you have the extreme anti-fatphobia crowd that thinks ozempic is bad because there is nothing wrong with being fat, and on the other end you have those who genuinely hate fat people thinking ozempic is wrong because you should have to lose weight the old fashioned way.

Most people sit somewhere in the middle on that spectrum. So do I. Drugs are neither good or bad. All that matters is their effects, and ozempic has shown astonishing clinical results in weight loss. Think most people would agree obesity is a big public health issue in our society (or maybe that's a CMV for another day). I don't think it's morally wrong to be fat, but I don't think it's good for you.

Personally I want to stop being fat for both health and aesthetic reasons, and I don't think that should be moralized. While it is not a huge priority in my life right now, I'd love to go on ozempic if it could help me lose weight. If I lost some weight it would be so much easier to be active and live a genuinely healthy lifestyle. And I would feel better about myself. I don't see what the big deal with ""doing it right"" is. I acknowledge that there are some side effects but those side effects pale in comparison to the hit to my quality of life caused by obesity. I have tried many many times to lose weight ""the right way"" to no avail. I have since learned to feel okay in my body, but tbh I would be a lot more comfortable if I were 100lb lighter. (26yo 6'4"" 350lb male for anyone who needs to know). As I get older my weight is going to affect my life span. If going on ozempic could add years and quality to my life why shouldn't I use it?

I know a lot of people will say ""it could have side effects we don't know about yet,"" but I don't find that convincing. *Everything* could have side-effects we don't know about yet. Being obese has side effects I *do* know about and experience right now. I view this argument the same as I view anti-vax arguments: the FDA's drug screening process is a lot more reliable than my unscientific intuition.

Edit:

On the argument ""when you stop taking it you'll gain the weight back""

I would be willing take it forever. And even if I couldn't, I just want to be healthy and active while I am young at least for a little while. My chance to do that is slipping away.

I haven't been a healthy weight since before puberty. I have never been athletic. I want to try sports and actually be good at them. I want to be able to run without shame and pain. I want to feel good when I look in the mirror. Even if it's temporary I want just a little time like that.

This argument alone cannot be dispositive. Being healthy for a little while and then going back to being fat is better than having been fat the whole time.

Edit 2:

I find it hilarious that I have explained multiple times how I managed to lose weight and keep it off when I lived in a different country with conditions that made it easier to make healthy choices and instead of trying to help me find solutions based on what has already worked, many brilliant health experts in the comments are suggesting ""no, ignore that. Keep everything in your life exactly the same but just start doing diet and exercise. You lack the willpower? Well stop it you silly goose. It's actually easy if you aren't such a pathetic loser.""

1h3fhh0,CMV: Liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only,"For a democracy to thrive it needs the following (among others):

* A population that agrees on facts: Therefore, channels of information (e.g., podcasts, social media, and traditional media) need to be able to distribute fair and accurate information to the public.
* A population that is informed of their civic duty and is willing to honor them: This means that political participation should be enabled as much as possible e.g by making voting as easy as possible, but most importantly by making education much more than just preparation for a job, but more about how to function as a participant in a society where democracy is the political system
* A political system that is not corrupted by money and special interests: i.e. shouldn't be allowed to buy votes or pay (donate to) politicians to pass favorable legislation.

Around the world, all of the above points are being undermined for example in the EU one of the vice presidents of the EU parliament was arrested for accepting bribes from Qatar, see here: [https://www.politico.eu/article/mep-kaili-charged-with-corruption-by-belgian-prosecutors-reports/](https://www.politico.eu/article/mep-kaili-charged-with-corruption-by-belgian-prosecutors-reports/)

There are many examples of the lack or deterioration of the above basic requirements in numerous places hence my view is that liberal democracies will eventually only be democracies in name only in the future unless we find a way of fixing the :

* information sources so that people can agree on the facts
* Voting is made easier and people understand their civic duty
* Remove corruption from politics.",kindly102,382,0.800000011920929,200,1732982133,2024-11-30 09:55:33,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h3fhh0/cmv_liberal_democracies_are_decaying_into/,11,2024

1gprni8,cmv: The “girl-bossification” of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is.,"It has become apparent in recent times that sex-work, either through OF or other means, has been received as a feminist movement that empowers women for sexualising themselves in exchange for money.

I’ll preface this by saying that I don’t wish to demonise sex work; women pushed to those positions should be protected and unharmed, and don’t deserve hateful narratives expressed in media.

However, on the other hand, not demonising prostitution or sex work does not mean viewing it as some profound, empowering stance. Sure, in an ideal world, to engage in sex work without the inequality of demand, pay, and income, would possibly result in a less degrading position, but that simply isn’t the world we live in. 

I’ve seen points such as: 

1) “Well, I could be assaulted/consent for sex, without making any money. So why not introduce an economic aspect to it?”

That is a reductive approach to the concept of one’s bodily autonomy. It is absolutely a tragedy that one could be assaulted, and feel as though they could gain something from it—and yes, hypersexuality is often a symptom of those who’ve experienced sexual abuse. These are not (a) empowering decisions, or (b) healthy decisions. In the same way that people may have found unhealthy coping mechanisms for PTSD, trying to own oneself sexually through economic means is similar in that regard. Consent cannot be garnered correctly wherein a transactional relationship is established. 

Similarly, if one does consent to sex, but also considers the monetary gain that could come from it, they may need to consider why they connect sex with an act of labour—is it because you are sleeping with partners you don’t like/are attracted to, or is it seen as an economic benefit that one could obtain? Are you considering sex work because you want to provide for yourself with means that are more easily accessible, as opposed to being rejected/unhappy in the normal corporate world? Perhaps the issue is that we are fed with media that convinces us that luxury is comfortability, and we woe the mundane life. Or perhaps we view sex work as easy and a get-rich quick scheme; consumers of it being stupid and desperate enough to pay for anything. But that isn’t the case.

As I’ve mentioned before, consent via economic transaction is not usual consent. That is not to say it’s abuse, or rape, but it is not normal relationship consent. It is not a hookup, or FWB, or relationship-established occurrence. It is the subjugation of one individual to service another. And regardless of the subjugated party gains money or economic gain from it, it is still an entirely degrading act to force oneself into. 

Feminists online seem to embrace sex work as a profoundly anti-patriarchal stance, without the realisation that it isn’t as autonomous as it seems. I will reiterate that sex workers deserve respect, but we shouldn’t parade it as a viable solution to earning money, or as a job. It is deeply flawed and dangerous, and in a modern society, we shouldn’t embrace the selling of one’s body.",Careful-Panda9885,377,0.800000011920929,493,1731436132,2024-11-12 12:28:52,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gprni8/cmv_the_girlbossification_of_sex_work_is_not_the/,11,2024

Reddit has a moderator problem. They can do a lot of things to you that doesn't really make lots of sense, and they do not give you a reason for it. More often than not, you're just muted from speaking with the moderator. Unfortunately, due to a lot of Reddit mods and Redditors in general being left-wing, there are a lot of examples of right-wingers being the victims. Such as this one on the r/ medicine Subreddit. He got deleted for asking questions. A person said Trump's NIH nomination caused ""large scale needless death"". When he was asked what the large scale death in question was, his comment was deleted by the mods. Along with a person being perm banned for saying ""orange man bad. Laugh at joke. Unga Bunga"" in r/ comics. The most notable case of moderation abuse is from r/ pics where they just ban you for participating in a ""bad faith Subreddit"". Even if you just commented.

This is not a good thing. It means that if you want to participate in a major Subreddit with a lot of people, you will have to conform to what the moderators personally see as ""correct"" or ""good"". This doesn't foster productive conversations, nor is it good for anybody but the moderator's egos.

1gnxluh,"CMV: We are producing Lost Boys in factory-like quantities, and the price will be astronomical","The hustle economy isn’t building anything sustainable; it’s hollowing out young men from the inside, encouraging them to project a flimsy brand rather than develop genuine value. And while everyone’s waving the flag of empowerment or self-actualization, all they're actually doing is exploiting a generation starving for direction, identity, and validation—otherwise known as the Lost Boys. 

>The Lost Boys Phenomenon: Disposable Youth

For the past two decades, we’ve been cultivating an entire demographic of disillusioned young men—educated in classrooms that devalue them, raised in families that are increasingly unstable or absent, and sent into a society that neither needs nor respects them. Despite the hand-wringing articles, neither side of the ideological divide cares about solving this problem; both are too busy pushing their own shallow narratives. On one hand, society shames these men as “overgrown boys” who avoid responsibility; on the other, it calls them “toxic” or dangerous if they express traditional masculinity. It’s a catch-22: no role models, no roadmap, just isolation and contradiction. Enter the Hustle Economy. It's the lifeline dangling in front of these young men. Except it’s not a lifeline; it’s a noose.

>Hustle Culture: The Mirage of Influence

In the hustle economy, brand trumps substance every time. Fame, however hollow, is currency. Validation, however fleeting, is dopamine. But here's the reality: we’ve created a system where ""influence"" is a simulacrum of achievement, where image and validation replace any real development of skills or character. Young men aren’t learning to create, innovate, or lead; they’re learning how to project a hollow image. They’re being conned into thinking that the *performance* of success is the same as success itself. Today, any Lost Boy can be a “thought leader” by spewing someone else’s platitudes into an algorithm and watching the numbers roll in.

But it’s all smoke and mirrors. The influencers and gurus selling the fantasy of the hustle economy—personal brands, online courses, or lifestyle tips—are the biggest hustlers of all. They’ve perfected the art of selling air, and they’re pulling these young men into their orbit by promising a quick path to purpose, self-worth, and financial success. What’s the result? It’s a generation of men seeking identity in follower counts and purpose in the next “grind,” never realizing they’re burning out their very souls for a temporary high that leaves them emptier each time.

> The Brand of Me: Identity in Freefall

Here’s the truth: we’ve so deeply intertwined personal identity with brand identity that young men now equate their self-worth with the size of their online following. It’s a vicious cycle. The hustle economy feeds insecurity by tying self-worth to fleeting metrics. Today, being a “man of substance” means being a man with influence, with likes, with numbers. No one cares what you do if no one can see it. And the problem with that? It’s a treadmill. When followers are your identity, you can’t afford to stop. When money is your validation, you can’t afford to fail.

This is what we're teaching them: that the projection of value is more critical than actual value, that growth is measured in clicks, not character. It's creating a generation of men who are as disposable as the metrics they chase. When numbers inevitably decline, when the brand fails to pivot, they’re left with nothing. And the cycle repeats, chewing up the next wave of Lost Boys looking for someone—anyone—to show them what it means to be worth something.

>The Hustle Economy: Grifters Teaching Grifters

These “gurus” and “coaches” know exactly what they’re doing: they’ve created an economy that preys on the desperate, selling hope in the form of clickbait aspirations. Each influencer, each “life coach,” each self-proclaimed expert is making bank by leveraging the vulnerabilities of the Lost Boys, who are seduced by the promise of easy money, fame, and—let’s be honest—female validation. The young men they’re targeting don’t know any better, because no one taught them anything better. They’re sheep without shepherds, and the only “guidance” they’re receiving is coming from people who are just looking to turn a profit on their insecurities. 

And let’s be clear: there’s no real value in what’s being sold. Hustlers aren’t innovating; they’re replicating the same playbooks, the same formulas, the same lies, and branding it as something revolutionary. They’re conning young men into buying courses, joining mastermind groups, and “leveling up” their personal brands, all while knowing that these Lost Boys are just prey. The real business of the hustle economy isn’t self-actualization or empowerment; it’s self-delusion, mass-marketed and highly profitable.

> The Cost: A Generation Hollowed Out

So where does this leave us? With a generation of men who are nothing but empty shells, men who have wasted their youth chasing shadows, men who wake up one day with nothing to show for their time except a string of expired “opportunities” and a lot of wasted money. Men who have no identity, no skills, and no real place in society. Men who are angrier, more isolated, more vulnerable than ever.

We are producing Lost Boys in factory-like quantities, and the price will be astronomical. A culture built on “influence” over innovation, on *sizzle over steak*, can only go one way: collapse. And when it does, when the next wave of young men finds out that their heroes were hustlers, that their dreams were hollow, that their worth was measured by numbers rather than their true potential, they won’t just be disappointed. They’ll be lost for good. The hustle economy isn’t an answer for these young men; it’s a death sentence dressed as a promise.",Top_Present_5825,336,0.75,466,1731233730,2024-11-10 04:15:30,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gnxluh/cmv_we_are_producing_lost_boys_in_factorylike/,11,2024

1h1sxtn,CMV: Adultery Should Be Treated as Breach of Contract with Financial Penalties,"Marriage isn’t just about love; it’s also a legal agreement regulated by the government. When you get married, you get a government-issued marriage license, which essentially makes it a formal contract between two people. So, if someone cheats (without consent), isn’t that a clear breach of the agreement? And if contracts in business or other legal contexts come with penalties when broken, why not this one too?

Here’s my view: adultery should be treated as fraud or deceit, not just a personal issue. If one partner cheats, there should be tangible, government-enforced consequences - like fines or losing alimony rights. This wouldn’t make cheating a criminal offense, but it would acknowledge the harm caused and hold the cheater accountable. Right now, the cheated-on spouse often suffers emotionally *and* financially (if they choose to start divorce proceedings), while the cheater faces no real repercussions. That’s just unfair.

If the government is involved in the marriage process from the start, issuing licenses and all that, why shouldn’t they also enforce penalties for breaching this contract? It’s not about moral policing; it’s about fairness and accountability.

1gjysh4,CMV: Lottery games with misleading odds should be illegal,"I'll give you a simplified example. 

A lottery game was advertised as $1 for ticket that is printed out of the machine at the time of purchase. The game was advertised as ""If your number matches our number. You win the prize"". The numbers can be 1 through 45.

So the advertised logic is that you have a 1 out of 45 chance to win.

I bought the ticket and lost.

So after looking online for several minutes, I found an obscure PDF file with the real odds. You have a 1 out of 500,000 chance to win.

How it works is it does a 1:500000 random number generation and if it decides you win, then it prints the ""winning number"" as the number you picked. Otherwise it randomly picks any of the other 44 losing numbers and puts that as the ""winning number"". 

To me, that is straight up fraud. 

It would be the equivalent of me telling you to guess a coin flip, but written on the bottom of my foot is a ""rule"" that lets me flip the coin to the opposite of whatever you picked 499,999 times out of 500,000. Then blaming you for not checking the bottom of my foot.
This fraud has become so commonly accepted that people blame you for taking their game's advertised rules at face value.

This is how the printable EzMatch and Scratch Off tickets work.

All the ""games"" and ""rules"" are obfuscation to hide the fact that the odds are astronomically higher than the known games they advertise (Bingo, 7-11-21, Lotteria, Number Matching, Monopoly, etc). 

The matching numbers they list are also irrelevant since they don't have ANY relevance to whether a ticket is a winning one or not. The numbers are just a façade to fraudulently think that the odds of winning are significantly higher than they really are. 

BTW, the tickets are in the machine with only the front facing so you can't read the back. Also the back contains ZERO information about the real odds. Instead it has a single line of small text that says ""visit the website for the rules"". That is only available after you've bought the ticket.

1gy6nns,CMV: ED meds like bluechew and hims are being vastly over-marketed for younger people,"Erectile dysfunction prescription medications like sildenafil are being sneakingly marketed for younger people for the wrong reasons. They’re being marketed as sexual performance enhancers rather than what they’re supposed to be used for, those with erectile dysfunction. Bluechew is a big one that started this, which uses generic viagra and cialis in their meds, but don’t mention that in their marketing ads. A lot of young people are under the illusion that these are supplements for sex, rather than the fact they actually contain ED medications 

Young people do not need these that often. ED is caused by blood vessel damage or high blood pressure. Psychological ED like performance anxiety, these do not even help that.

1gyvez1,cmv: Abortion bans like the one in Idaho don't actually protect the life of the mother because they were intentionally drafted to allow for excessive danger to women.  ,"Many of the abortion bans are dangerous for women.  Conservatives say these bills aren't dangerous because they provide exceptions for life of the mother.  I actually bought this line to some extent until these news stories started popping up, and even then I was a bit skeptical, but I decided to research these bans myself, and that's when I saw exactly how dangerous they are.

The one in Idaho provides that an abortion may be performed when ""necessary to save the life of the mother"" with no clarification given as far as I can tell. That is both incredibly restrictive language, and incredibly vague. So let's say a woman has a 45% chance of dying if the doctors don't perform an abortion, is doing one ""necessary"" to save her life? What about 10%? With a 2-5 year prison sentence awaiting any doctor who violates these rules, and with them being so strict and vague, it's no wonder than women are being put in dangerous positions.  

""Necessary"" in other statutes and case law is often deemed to include a time requirement. So even if a condition will likely lead to the mother's death, a doctor may have to wait until the situation gets bad enough to actually treat her which further adds to the danger. 

As incompetent as state legislators can be, half of them are lawyers and know exactly what they were doing with language like this.  They are making it as difficult as possible to get an abortion while still telling the public they are protecting the lives of women, even when they are not.

Even if one is pro life, most of them still support protections for the life of the mother. They should want these bans to be repealed and to be replaced with something more reasonable that actually protect the life of the mother

1gty4bv,"CMV: Americans and people in the West's criticism of Netanyahu is for the ""wrong reasons"", and would have been the same if any other Israeli was in charge","Israelis hate Netanyahu, but not because of the reasons Americans/people in the world despise him. Israelis hate Netanyahu because he is a corrupted megalomaniac with a god complex, not because of ""war crimes"" or because of his tough stances on Palestinians. In fact most Israelis dislike the Palestinians (especially after Oct7) and share the tough stances on them. 

Even when Netanyahu goes, Israelis still won't support a 2SS (Most of the opposition opposes it), the War will continue and in fact, all of the criticism about Netanyahu for his management of the War and the genocide remarks would have been the same even if Lapid or Yair Golan were in charge, because when it comes to the War and Oct7, most of Israelis are pretty united. (While they are divided when it comes to the Hostage deal, the global Ceasefire now crowd is using the hostages to push a prominent ceasefire that will keep Hamas in power and end the War, while Israelis who want the hostage deal still want Hamas destroyed and to continue the war after the deal)

The Western left who considers themselves as Pro-Israel and anti-bibi, wants Netanyahu gone because they see him as an ""obstacle"" to the 2 State solution (That nowadays no Israeli and no Palestinian support). They don't really care about his domestic corruption and attempts to become a de-facto dictator. At the same time, if you would say to the Israeli public (including the secular centrists who voted for people like Lapid, Gantz and Lieberman) that the world views Bibi as an obstacle to the 2SS, it would make them appreciate Netanyahu for standing up to the world and deflecting pressures.

1gx4o9z,CMV: Culling male chicks is the least cruel option after in-ovo sexing,"Several EU countries have banned the practice of culling male chicks because the general population finds it ""icky."" The thing is, factory farming as a whole is inherently icky and culling the male chicks is objectively the most humane way of dealing with the fact that it makes zero economic sense to raise these chickens. Instead of going into the grinder shortly after they hatch, the male chicks are shipped off to live in a warehouse with the absolute worst conditions allowed by law until they're ready for slaughter. So we either kill the chick on day 1 or we kill it on like day 50 after it's spent its entire life inside a windowless warehouse where there's not even enough space to move. Either way, we're killing the chicken and the grinder minimizes the time it has to suffer. 

Raising all of the male chickens also causes a surplus of chicken meat and, since there isn't enough demand for this meat in the EU, it ends up being exported to developing nations and destabilizing their own poultry industry, which will inevitably cause them to be dependent on the EU for food. Without fail, every single time a developing nation has become dependent on wealthier nations for food, it has had absolutely devastating consequences for the development of that nation. So you can't even really argue that ""At least the male chickens are dying for a reason if we slaughter them"" because a) the chickens *literally* do not give a fuck and b) the ""reason"" is to dump cheap meat in Africa. 

Destroying the male eggs before they even hatch with in-ovo sexing is obviously the best option but, as far as I understand, this is still pretty expensive and hasn't been universally adopted. Until the cost for in-ovo sexing comes down, the grinder remains the best option. It would be different if the male chicks were being shipped off to some green pasture to live out their days but this is literally the opposite of what actually happens to them. I would even argue that these bans on culling are a form of performative activism so that privileged Europeans can feel better about themselves while they remain willfully ignorant to the horrors of factory farming.
