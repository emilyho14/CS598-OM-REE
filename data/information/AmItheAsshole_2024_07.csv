1e3ggnn,AITA for not punishing my daughter for what she said ,"My husband and I are slightly more well off than my sisters family. Because of this my parents do more for them than they do us. When it comes to gifts my daughter (Maddie 7) get things from the dollar store while my nephews get whole Lego sets, iPads and even Disney trips. If my sister needs babysitting they will drop everything for her last minute. If I need it I have to give them a two week’s heads up as well as proper payment. 

Because of this clear favoritism my daughter doesn’t have a good relationship with them. If you as her about her grandparents her mind automatically goes to my husband’s parents because she forgets that she has two pairs. 

Earlier today we having a rare meet up with my parents. My daughter asked if she can go on the trampoline outside. My dad said no because it’s for my nephews. My daughter begged but dad still said no. Maddie then stomps away and said this is why I like other grandma and grandpa more. My parents looked at me expectantly but I didn’t do anything. I recently got off a call with my mom saying I should have told Maddie that was wrong to say. I told her what do you expect she thinks y’all hate her and y’all do nothing to dispel those thoughts. She just got quiet for a bit then said I still shouldn’t let her say something like that to family and hung up. 

My husband is on my side but he also isn’t a fan of my family so I need an outside opinion AITA?

1e2mcq3,"AITA For making a scene when my brothers girlfriend tried to ""protect her peace""?","I didn't know how to title the post. I apologise. 

My son is eleven months old and 97th percentile for height. He is a big ass baby (currently 36in tall - or about the size of your average 2.5yo) and in 3T clothing. 

However, despite him being so big, he is still just a baby and most of his nutrition ia still from breastmilk. 

For the 4th we had a big family cookout and my brother invited his girlfriend. I live out of state and I didn't want my flights to be too close together so I'm staying for a bit longer. My brother and his girlfriend are doing the same thing.

My family is aware that my son is a baby, obviously, but my brothers girlfriend was not and was initially very shocked when she saw him ""misbehaving"". We explained that he's still a baby, so he's still just exploring the world.

She remained uncomfortable but we mostly avoid each other. Because he's so big feeding him is a chore so I use an armchair as there isn't enough support elsewhere and so there isn't much I can do about covering up (he gets sweaty under blankets and won't eat).

It's been a tense couple of weeks. Last night I think we both kind of lost it. My son needed feeding and she was in the chair; I asked her to move which she whined about but did get up. Everything was fine for another hour or so until she demanded my brother pay for her to go to a hotel for the remaining nights because she can't cope with me and the baby.

He asked what she meant and she said that he's clearly big enough to be on real food and I enjoy making her uncomfortable by feeding him in front of her. 

I got embarrassingly upset and told her that she should keep her mouth shut because she clearly doesn't know the first thing about parenting and certainly doesn't know anything about me or my son.

We argued the same points for a little more until my son woke from his nap and I left to collect him. She then left after telling us all, loudly, that she needs to ""protect her peace"" (which is honestly not a phrase I thought real people said). 

My brother told me I was being immature and left with her. My dad is on ""my side"" but did tell me I should have removed myself from the situation as I'm a grown woman and she's still a teenager (I'm three years older than her so I think thats BS). My mom is neutral but is still trying to convince my brother to come home and ended up paying for their hotel. She thinks I could have been a lot more understanding.

1ebfwkq,AITA For turning my teenage niece away at the door and telling my sister to wake up because of how my niece treats my own daughter?,"My sister Teresa has a sixteen year old daughter Quinn. “Quinn” and I used to be very close when she was younger, and loved having auntie-niece time together. However, since becoming a teenager, Quinn has become very snarky and sarcastic in a mean way.



I particularly don’t like the way she behaves towards my own daughter Bella (she is six.) Quinn crosses the line. A particular episode of verbal cruelty at a birthday party was when I’d had enough and told Quinn “I don’t want you to come over until you can start being nice to Bella.” Teresa was present when I said this.



We live a short walk away from each other. A few days ago, Quinn arrived and wanted dinner, and I turned her away at the door and told her “I don’t like how you treat my daughter. Unless it is an emergency, you are not welcome over.”



Teresa called me because she said I was a horrible person for turning Quinn away because she is sixteen and my niece was upset.



(Teresa has stopped trying to do anything serious about Quinn’s verbal attitude and has justified it in the past with statements along the lines of “That’s just how some teenagers are,” “It’s a teen thing. Teenagers shouldn’t be treated like young children,” or “Quinn’s almost an adult. It’s not your place to parent her like some child.”



I brought up Teresa’s past words and told her she is correct that Quinn is an adult who doesn’t need to be scolded by me. And I have a right to protect my child from an unkind adult. Quinn is already having issues with the school emailing home or friends making excuses for why they don’t want to see her. And it’s time to Teresa to wake up and do something about her daughter.



Teresa and I have both given our sides to mutual friends and acquaintances, and they are divided. Some are saying that Quinn’s attitude is not okay, but I was wrong to turn her away at the door because she’s still sixteen and my niece.



They said being a teenager and rapidly going from childhood to adulthood is already a rough transition. And according to Teresa, Quinn appears to be having issues at school, and I should try to have more patience with her and see what may be going on outside of home.



Regardless of the reason, I feel I had to set a hard boundary with Quinn’s behavior. It isn’t an easy time, but at sixteen, you still know right from wrong. And Bella doesn’t deserve to be subjected to that kind of treatment. But are my friends/acquaintances correct that I was too hard on my niece and sister and should apologize for how I responded to them?",TooHardOnMyFamily,8993,0.9700000286102295,1040,1721863540,2024-07-24 18:25:40,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ebfwkq/aita_for_turning_my_teenage_niece_away_at_the/,7,2024
1e492i1,AITA for telling my husband taking the kids for the day isn’t “help”,"I’m a stay at home mom of 2 young kids. My husband works, sometimes long hours..so I am usually in charge of the day to day routines/schedules/activities, cooking meals, etc. It works out for us.  He is taking this week off, and decided he would take the kids for today (all day) He told me I deserve a day to relax as this week is our “vaca” for the summer. I ran some errands, and while out I spoke with my husband briefly about dinner. He asked if I would be home for dinner, to which I replied yes. When I got home, his first question was “what are we doing for dinner” and I told him I assumed he would have already figured that out, seeing as it’s getting close to bed time for the kids.  He said there was no food in the house and would go out to the store to grab groceries.. at this point it’s getting late, so I told him to just order food. He did (begrudgingly) and asked why I was so irritated and why I couldn’t just do it, he said he “helped all day with the kids” ….

1eg624k,AITA for not caring that I was uninvited to my older brother’s wedding,"
This whole thing is so weird. I, (27M), am gay. I came out at 16 and my parents told me they would always love me, but to not mention it to my older brother who I'll call Brick, (then 19M, 30M now). When I was confused and asked why, they said that Brick had expressed some awful opinions about gay people. I limited talking to Brick until I moved out at 18, which wasn't much of a problem because we were never close.

I went to uni, got good job, and an awesome boyfriend (28M), in my home city. Me and my boyfriend Angel live a peaceful life. Peaceful until a few days ago when I got a call from my brother. I was concerned that Brick was calling me, as we have never messaged before, just had each other's numbers for emergency purposes. I picked up because maybe there was some emergency happening.

He opened the call with an annoyed ""hey man"" and I knew something was up. He said he was getting married to his fiance Yen (24F) next year. I didn't even know he had a girlfriend! I was like ""that's great Brick!"" and asked some boring wedding things that he begrudgingly answered. He then told me invites were being sent out in a couple weeks, and that I could bring a plus one. Here's where I made the mistake that started this mess. Without thinking like an idiot, I said, ""cool, I'll bring my boyfriend."" Major. Mess up. Brick immediately started yelling insults down the line, screaming that he ""wouldn't have an [f slur] at his wedding."" I didn't say anything and just hung up. I was rattled by hearing those words from my own brother's mouth, even though I knew his feelings about people like me. I told Angel, and he comforted me, ordering in my favourite restaurant and watching movies with me, which was awesome. We went to bed later and I felt alright the next day.

I sent my parents a message that Brick invited me and uninvited me from his wedding pretty much in the same breath, and went on my way to work, not a clue of the crapstorm waiting for me when I got off. When I turned my phone on again after my shift, it was blowing UP. Messages and calls from my parents and relatives galore asking me what the f happened? I phoned my parents back when I got home and gave them the run down of what happened, and said I honestly didn't care because it's not like Brick would be coming to my wedding anyways. My parents immediately chastised me for my ""obvious disinterest and disregard of my brother's life"" and told me I should be apologizing to HIM for bringing my personal life into his wedding. WHAT? I basically told my parents to screw off and have been getting bombarded with messages from relatives to apologize to my brother and get my invite reinstated, and apologize to my parents for disrespecting them, but I really don't want to. Angel's reassuring me that I did nothing wrong, but it's still nagging me.

1e47r5k,AITA for leaving the dry wedding wedding early to go to go out.,"So 2 weeks ago I 35f went to a wedding in our college town for a member of our college friend group.  My husband and I left the kids with my parents and we went.  We got a Vrbo with another couple I went to college with for a few days.  My husband and I don’t have a ton of time to ourselves away from the kids so we were excited to let loose.

 On the invitation it said the wedding went to 11 with an after party with the bride and groom at the venue.  The venue was a gorgeous mansion and the bride and groom had it for the night, they were leaving for the honeymoon the next morning.  

Cut to wedding day and it’s a dry wedding.  Apparently the groom is 2 years sober.  No one told us this and we were admittedly bummed.  When we found out there was no alcohol we told people we were going to some bars after and not going to the after party.  We left the wedding at 9:30 because we were itching to go out and the wedding was boring.  

Pretty much the whole college crew left around that time and went out.  Apparently, the bride's friend group did not stay for the party, the grooms did and the optics were very lopsided at the party.  We all heard from the bride about this and she called us assholes for leaving.  She said that she didn't feel supported and felt like we were spiteing her now husband for his sobriety.  I told her that she was reading too much into  it.  We just wanted to go out.  She is especially mad at me as i'm looked at as the ringleader of this outing.  I don't think i've done anything wrong AITA?

1e4962n,AITA for banning my roommates girlfriend for touching my raw cookie dough?,"I rent a room to a lad called AJ. He’s 31. He is dating Nina (25f). I don’t mind if AJ has people over or anything but Nina has been here a lot. 
I am already annoyed because Nina always asks to borrow stuff from me. “Can I borrow a pair of pants for work I forgot mine? Do you have extra face masks or can I borrow lotion/tampons/socks?” 
I have always told her no. I don’t make a lot and I don’t loan things. She was furious I wouldn’t give her a pad but I use a diva cup and period underwear and I am NOT sharing those. 🤮 
She got mad I wouldn’t loan her a dress for their “surprise” date night. I told her if she asks again for ANYTHING of mine then she’s not allowed back in the apartment. 
I told her to stop acting like we are friends and don’t use my stuff. Short of like medical things (bandaids) she should go buy her own stuff. 
This led to AJ being mad at me for making her feel unwelcome. I said I don’t want her around at all and the next time it happens I’m gonna ban her. He said she is not that bad. 
I ended up letting him know one more step over the line and she’s gone. 
And if he breaks that ban, he can find a new place as he is month to month. 
Nina ended up being fine for a few days. I was making cookies from scratch. They come in from some date. She sees the cookies and asks the kind. I tell her chocolate chip and she comes over, sticks her finger in the dough, and takes a chunk. 
I got so mad I told her to get out.  She’s banned. I didn’t care. When AJ tried to argue with me I said I am not renewing his lease if she’s not gone in two minutes. 
They left and I am now being called an asshole by friends. AITA?",only_child_by_choice,7372,0.9599999785423279,748,1721084916,2024-07-15 18:08:36,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e4962n/aita_for_banning_my_roommates_girlfriend_for/,7,2024
1e8xr9a,"AITA for refusing to wear a bracelet I wanted, but my husband paid for?","I (29F) wanted to buy a bracelet for myself because I finally had a job after searching for a long time and wanted to treat myself. My husband (35M) suggested I buy it from his parents because they run a jewellery store and they’d offer me a good deal. That had been my plan anyway, so when we visited them (they live in another State), I went by their store and had a look at what they had in stock. I decided on a piece but didn’t take it right away, as I needed to withdraw some cash.

A few days later I overheard my husband talking to his Mom about me but couldn’t hear what it was about (context info: there had been some negative talk in the past about my struggling to find a job & I wanted to know if that’s what it was about).  I asked my husband later what they were discussing about me and he said “nothing” but I got the feeling he felt caught out. Then he said they were talking about the bracelet I wanted and he was going to buy it. I said I was happy to buy it for myself but he insisted, and said he’d sort it out. I was thankful and said okay.

Then, after we returned home I asked about the bracelet and he said he was gonna give it to me later, maybe my birthday. I was annoyed because I wanted to buy the bracelet and wear it, like immediately, and that’s what I would’ve done if he hadn’t bought it. He said he paid for it, and that was a nice thing for him to do. I agreed, but said if he kept it, then it felt like he took it from me, and was making me wait to get something that I was prepared to pay for myself.We had a low-level fight about it, after which he said I can just have it right then, but I said I didn’t even really want it anymore because now every time I wear it, I will think about this argument and the whole gesture feels ruined. He accused me of being ungrateful. 

We recounted this story to his friends (I don’t have many friends as we moved here recently) and they all agreed that he paid for it, so I should just be happy, but I feel like if he wanted to pay for a gift that I had picked out and was about to purchase myself, then it’s not fair to make me wait months for it.

Am I the asshole for being upset about him keeping it / not wanting to wear the bracelet anymore?

INFO: he did give me the bracelet right after the discussion but as you can imagine, it wasn’t as happy a moment as anyone imagined.

1e6pq34,AITA For not taking the blame for unknowingly breaking a mom's rules for her kid?,"My (41f) daughter (15) had a sleepover a couple of days ago with four of her friends. From what I observed, the girls had a lot of fun together and were all very respectful of each other, my husband, and I. Most of the girls’ parents thanked me and my husband for hosting and said positive things, but one texted me a list of all the things I did wrong.

The first thing that upset this mom was the fact that my daughter and her friends went swimming in our backyard pool. When the sleepover invites were sent out via text message, I asked the moms if they were okay with their girls going swimming. All of them said “yes” or “that’s okay with me” except for the complaining mom, who simply liked my text. I assumed this meant yes. I would not have allowed this had the girls not been forced to pass a swimming safety unit (which included a swim test at the end) for their PE class. Additionally, my husband completed a lifeguarding course from the Red Cross and passed with flying colors. The mom’s second issue was the food the girls ate, which she deemed unhealthy. I however, did not see an issue with this because I think eating junk at sleepovers is okay. The next issue was the movie the girls watched after dinner. Since some of the girls are 14 and others are 15, we told them no R rated movies, but other than that it was up to them. They ended up choosing The Fault In Our Stars, which the complainer deemed inappropriate. The final thing she was mad about was the fact that the girls didn’t actually go to sleep until midnight. As a mom myself, I understand because I want my daughter to get enough sleep. However, both my husband and I do think that sleepovers are a time when it’s okay to stay up late, provided the kids let the parents sleep (which my daughter and her friends did). Additionally, the girls woke up at 8:30, meaning they got about 8 1/2 hours of sleep. 

I received the complaining mom’s text on the day after the sleepover. The text said “Thank you for having my daughter over. It was generous of you to open up your home and graciously host her. However, I feel that many of your decisions were questionable and inappropriate”. She then proceeded to list her objections with specific reasons for each one. I then replied, “Please tell your daughter thanks for coming! She was a pleasure to host. I understand your concerns, but considering that you never communicated your expectations or rules, I don’t think it’s fair to place the blame on me. If we ever do things like this in the future, please make sure to let me know of any restrictions ahead of time. Thank you and have a lovely weekend!” She then responded angrily that it was my fault, and when I texted her to say sorry, she didn’t respond. AITA for not taking the blame?

1ec9xtp,AITA for not helping my younger sister just because she has Cancer?,"Okay so before the story I want to give background. Our dad is pacific islander, and our mom (38F) is just white. My sister (14F) and I (17F) were both born in the US. Our parents divorced when I was six I think. However I continued to live my dad until I was 11, whereas my sister stayed with my mom. I live with my mom now because my dad wanted to move back to the islands, but I didn't want to leave my friends. However I know much of my family who still do live on the islands, and keep in touch with my 'roots' I guess. This is mostly thanks to my dad. My sister doesn't. Okay so onto the story. 

About four months ago my sister was diagnosed with Sarcoma which is like a kind of bone/tissue cancer. She's had to go through a lot of procedures and spend a lot of time at the hospital, and I've spent a lot of it with her and helping her, and while I don't mind helping her, when she did get diagnosed my Mom expected me to drop literally everything to be there to help her. Meaning if she's at the hospital, I'm at the hospital. If she's undergoing a surgery or 'stressful procedure' I have to stop everything I'm doing (including school) and sit in the waiting room as support. 

But all that I could handle and it was annoying but whatever. However recently the doctors finally decided they wanted to do Chemo, and my sisters hair has begun to fall out. She shaved it, but is extremely upset about it, because she really loved her hair. The other day my mom suggested that I shave my own hair so a wig can be made out of it for her. For reference my hair goes down to below my butt. However the thing is you're only supposed to cut your hair when a family member dies, and it's a tradition my entire family (dad's side) upholds. And to be frank, I like my hair and have no desire to shave it, as I have been growing it out since I was a kid. 

I explained this to both my sister and my mom, but both are instant that I should do it, and that a tradition like that is meaningless, especially since my sister might die anyways. I told them no. They've both asked several times more, and my sister even begging. I once again reiterated why I wouldn't, and that asking me too was insulting. 

Now my sister is upset and saying that I obviously don't actually care that she's struggling and aren't being understanding. However I've bent over backwards for her, so the fact she's going so far hurts. But she's also never asked me of anything like this before and is really upset, so I just don't know, AITA??",IamGojoTrust,6798,0.9599999785423279,1194,1721951817,2024-07-25 18:56:57,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ec9xtp/aita_for_not_helping_my_younger_sister_just/,7,2024
1dym5c5,AITA for Not Inviting My Sister to My Wedding After She Ruined My Proposal?,"I (29M) recently got engaged to my girlfriend (28F), and it was supposed to be one of the happiest moments of our lives. I had planned a romantic proposal at our favorite spot, a secluded beach where we had our first date. I had everything ready: flowers, a small picnic, and a photographer hiding nearby to capture the moment.

When the day came, my sister (32F) insisted on tagging along. She said she wanted to take a few ""candid"" photos of us before the proposal. I was hesitant but agreed, thinking it might make the moment more special. Big mistake.

As we reached the spot, my sister started acting weird, making snarky comments and trying to direct the whole scene like a movie. My girlfriend could sense something was off, and the mood was getting ruined. Then, out of nowhere, my sister grabbed the ring box from my pocket and yelled, ""Surprise! Look what he's going to do!"" My girlfriend was shocked, and I was furious.

I managed to salvage the proposal somewhat, but the moment was tainted. My girlfriend said yes, but we both felt the proposal was ruined. Later, I confronted my sister, and she just laughed it off, saying she was ""just trying to help"" and that I was overreacting.

Fast forward to our wedding planning, and my fiancée and I decided not to invite my sister. We wanted our day to be about us, without any unnecessary drama. When my family found out, they were furious. My parents called me heartless, and my sister is playing the victim, saying I'm tearing the family apart over a ""little joke.""

Now I'm feeling conflicted. AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding after she ruined my proposal?

Edit: Here are a few other, not so minor, instances in which my sister has done me wrong:

	1.	My sister has a long history of attention-seeking behavior. She’s the type to fake fainting at parties just to get everyone’s attention. She once “accidentally” set off the fire alarm at my fiancée’s birthday party, causing the whole place to evacuate and ruining the celebration.
	2.	This wasn’t the first time she’s crossed the line with me. When I got my first big promotion, she announced she was pregnant at the same party, only to later admit she was joking. At another family event, she spiked the punch with alcohol knowing I was on medication that strictly prohibited drinking.

1eg7nk3,AITA for telling my husband's ex that I must have been the favorite girlfriend since he married me?,"Ok so my 40sF husband 40sM have been off and on since we were 12, broke up at 22, took a 17 year break and got together 3 years ago and have been married for a little over 2. He spent almost 3 years with an ex and they broke up about 10years ago.
  
The ex, who I will call Patty, and my husband Doug broke up on good terms and she will reach out here and there to say happy birthday, merry Christmas and she reached out when she heard we were getting married and gave us her congratulations. 

Saturday night we went to the local bar and she happened to be there and we all sat together drinking, talking and just hanging out. I was 3 jack and Cokes in and I can not remember how it got brought up but Patty at one point said ""Well at least I will always be your favorite girlfriend."" I laughed and said ""Wouldn't I be his favorite girlfriend since I'm the one he married?"" She stopped smiling and just looked at me. She finished her drink and let not long after that. 

Last night Doug got a long message from Patty saying she was really shocked at how jealous, immature,Petty and mean I am given my age and that I should be more secure in our marriage and in myself and that it's okay for Doug to care about others besides just me. She also told him how much him telling her she was his favorite girlfriend all those years ago had always meant to her and can't understand why I had to shit on it.

Doug told her he was sorry what I said upset her but that I was just saying a fact, I was the favorite girlfriend and that's a huge reason he married me. She sent back another long text saying I just think I'm better than her because Doug had a very firm stand that he would never marry, he didn't care if he had a gun to his head it wouldn't happen. When we reconnected this time he asked me to marry him after a month and we married after 8 and a half months. Doug told her that it wasn't true,I don't think I'm better than anyone and said again he was sorry she was hurt but that I said nothing wrong,told her the things she was saying about me aren't true and to be er speak about me like that again. 


I truly never in a million years would want to hurt anyone's feelings. I said I was his favorite because I feel like you marry your favorite person don't you? Why would you marry someone who isn't your favorite? So am I the asshole here? Doug told me it's not in anyway on me that she got hurt. My best friend said that I didn't say anything that wasn't true and thinks maybe Patty is going through some stuff or just went through a break up and is just taking it out on me.

1dvi59q,AITA For Taking My Daughter On A Shopping Spree?,"Context: I 35(F) have two kids, one being 13(F) and the other 10(M). My husband just took my son on a boys trip to Michigan and I just got promotion.

My son had been wanting to go on the boys trip for months and my Husband and I finally made the plans for it. Once they left, I told my daughter “let’s go to the mall.” She got all excited which made me excited and we hopped in the car. 

We went to Bath and Body Works and I got her a candle. And we went to American Eagle and she wanted a pair of jeans and earrings, so I got them for her. Then lastly, we got Starbucks after I took her to Ulta to get her a new mascara. 

I wanted to treat her since we couldn’t go on a vacation. She was super happy and grateful. I wanted to use my promotion for good.

Once the boys got home my daughter was so excited to show her brother what she got. And he got so upset that she got all these cool things and he got nothing. My husband also said that I shouldn’t get her all of these things and that it’s not fair to my son. They had went on a week long vacation. I don’t want my family to pick sides.

1eektaw,AITA for telling my SIL how I feel about her baby name after she asked?,"I 28F have a SIL Ana 35F. She is 8 months pregnant. She has had 3 miscarriages in the past and had to have an abortion after her last pregnancy was not viable. 

Her pregnancy is taking a huge toll on her, she had awful morning sickness and pre existing medicinal conditions that have worsened and she is on sick leave. 

I offered to plan her baby shower as she was unable to, and offered up our place for her and BIL as it was mainly family and a few friends that I know through her. 

The baby shower was a hit, Ana was really pleased with how everything turned out and at the shower told everyone that she is keeping the gender of her baby a surprise, but her and BIL picked out a name for the baby. They want to name the baby Five as the number is the amount of years they have tried to conceive and it took them 3 miscarriages and one termination.

Ana said it’s a reminder of her baby’s older siblings, and I expressed in private after she asked what I thought of the name that it might not be this symbolic for their baby when they grow up to understand the meaning, I did say the word burden which led to Ana getting really upset and left, and my BIL followed her out. 

BIL called me after and was upset and said I made Ana cry and ruined the baby shower.  My husband agrees with me on the name Five, but he thinks it wasn’t our place to say anything and that Ana and his brother had been through a lot of infertility struggles and that I should just let her have the name as there are worse names she could have picked. Five is a unique name but I was just trying to point out the meaning of the name they had picked, and the implications of it.",Sensitive-Gain9314,5198,0.9599999785423279,2173,1722208979,2024-07-28 18:22:59,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1eektaw/aita_for_telling_my_sil_how_i_feel_about_her_baby/,7,2024
1eeiyw4,AITA for asking my parents to stop telling people I am in hospital?,"Hi all. I (25f) am currently pregnant and have been admitted to hospital a few days ago for a suspected clot in my lung following severe chest pain. I am still in hospital right now.

A few weeks ago, my wonderful maternal grandfather passed from cancer and we are obviously as a family still upset.

2.5 years ago I was in a car accident. I broke my back in 3 places, my pelvis, and 3 ribs. It was during COVID so I was admitted to hospital and had loads of scans all through the day/night. Once they figured that I didn’t need corrective surgery they discharged me the following morning with morphine tablets and a wheelchair. I came out of hospital to  around 100 messages from people I barely knew wishing me well. My mum and stepdad had posted pictures of my wrecked car on Facebook and told everyone they knew about the accident and specifics about my injuries. At the time I asked them to take down the posts as I did not want people knowing all about my personal life. They never took the posts down.

Today my friend told me that my mum has been sending messages into group chats telling people that I am pregnant and in hospital. My stepdad told his family the same. I have told them that my husband and I want to share the news ourselves. I told them that I was so hurt and disappointed that they have told people and also lied to me about it. I pointed out the lie and told them that I had again, received messages from others proving that they lied. My mum then sent me a voice note of her crying saying “sorry I don’t know what I have done but I am sorry. I must be the worst mother in the world. I am just so upset about Pappa too.” It was hard to hear her so upset by I just reiterated that asking for privacy was not too much to ask.

My stepdad who I have been very close to also sent me a voice note telling me that “they don’t need this stress” and to stop being so hateful over something so “trivial”. He told me that I was clearly hormonal but that he’ll “let it slide this time” because I am pregnant. He told me that my mum has cried for over 30 mins and it’s all my fault and that it’s all over nothing. Also, that they told other people because they are worried about me. Hesaid they will never apologise as they haven’t done anything wrong. He also said that I am the daughter he never had and that he loves me but that he is so disappointed in my behaviour.

The original message that started this sent to my mum:

Sorry it’s just I’ve had messages from people today wishing me well in hospital so I know you lied about who you have told about me being here. I am just hurt and disappointed as I would have much preferred privacy. I don’t feel like sharing any more because I don’t know who you are both sharing it with and it has actually made me being in hospital much more stressful

I might be TA because we are all grieving and emotions are running high. I also don’t feel like they told other people in a malicious way, just thoughtless. So, AITA?

1dwb70t,AITA - I asked my fiancé to get me a drink in bed,"This is my first time posting on reddit. Slightly confused by our interaction tonight. As background, we have 4.5 month old twins that have only just started sleeping through the night, so having time to ourselves again in the evening is a novelty. He works.. I look after the twins 5 days a week 8-6. 

We were settled in bed watching tv. I had brought us up a drink each about an hour before this. I asked him if he would mind grabbing us another drink as I was warm in bed. He said no. I asked why, and he replied that he was also in bed.

I was a little annoyed. More so because every single morning I bring him a coffee in bed (even when I was pregnant and the smell made me gag). I bring him drinks if I’m in bed and he is thirsty in the bath. I’d get up to hoover the moths away if they make him uncomfortable. I think my love language is acts of service. If you read into that sort of stuff. I always thought that doing something like that isn’t a big deal if it’s for your partner.

I told him I was a bit put out - just to be honest with him. He told me he was not my personal slave and he didn’t realise that he had to ‘jump’ whenever I told him to. Please bear in mind, I have never asked him for a drink in bed before, or anything else unreasonable that I can think of. I told him I didn’t think of him that way at all.. I just told him that if it was the other way around I’d just do it because it was something nice to do for your partner. He disagreed and said I was being unreasonable and stupid for getting upset about it. 

This eventually turned into an argument. He told me to ask ‘anyone’ about it and I would realise that I am in the wrong. So I thought… maybe reddit? 

Is this issue arising just because we have different ways of expressing love and affection etc? Or is it a deeper issue? Am I being unreasonable - it’s something I’m willing to work on if so.

1dt7jgf,AITA for telling my husband he needs to quit his dream job?,"So I (32F) and my husband (29M) live in an area with an extremely high cost of living. I work a job that pays decently well, which is kind of necessary to live where we do. My husband worked a job for years that paid less than mine did, but was okay overall, though he absolutely hated working there.

Around October of last year, my husband managed to get a job in his dream career field. He had been working at it for years, and was really excited about finally getting there. However, it's come with 

The big issue is, the pay in his field is abysmal. He works as a freelancer (which is standard in his industry) so his job has zero benefits, and it's a pretty significant pay cut from his old job.

We don't have combined finances, and after he took the new job, we had to rearrange how we pay for things to account for his lower income. Previously, he had covered a slightly larger percentage of the expenses due to me having student loans to pay off while he didn't. As it is now, I have to be the breadwinner since his income was basically halved, paying for a larger portion of the expenses.

I sat him down recently and told him I felt he needed to quit his job and find a better-paying field because it just wasn't feasible. He got upset, since like I said, this is something he's dreamed of for years and worked really hard to get, which I understand. But I just feel this  isn't fair to me. We've had to cut back on a lot of things and there's not really any sign of a pay increase at this point. I feel like I'm carrying him.

He offered to get a part-time job on the side, but I know anything he could get that would be feasible for him while keeping his current job wouldn't provide much. He suggested we move somewhere less expensive, to which I said absolutely not, since we'd have to go quite  a ways to find something in that range and it'd mean ridiculously long commutes to my work and being further away from my family. He offered to have his parents help, which I don't want because it's not a long-term solution.

He's extremely upset, and I understand it, because I know he worked hard to get here. If he quit now, it'd basically kill his career and it would be extremely hard for him to get another shot at this job. It's not like we're struggling, which is true, we can pay rent and put food on the table, but I hate feeling like this. I work long days at a rather difficult job, while he works from home doing something he did before as a hobby and only makes half as much money now. My point is that it's not like he has to stop doing what he does altogether, since as I mentioned, he did it as a hobby beforehand, but he's upset because he said this is the only thing he's ever wanted to do career-wise and giving it up now would mean he likely never would be able to make it work.

AITA? I understand this is important to him but I'm starting to resent him because I feel like the burden of our finances are being placed on me and we've had to cut back on a lot of things.",Kitchen-Page-2111,3672,0.7799999713897705,3579,1719877025,2024-07-01 18:37:05,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dt7jgf/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_needs_to_quit_his/,7,2024
1dt7idd,AITA for asking my husband to hold his pee during flight with 2 kids,"My husband and I flew a 3.5hr flight with our 3mo old and 2.5yo recently. We were unable to buy seats together so I was in the middle aisle with baby and he was across the aisle of me with the aisle seat and the toddler in the middle. 

About an hour into the flight my husband gets up to pee while I’m nursing baby and as soon as he leaves the toddler crawls over to me. I try to get the toddler to sit on my lap but he causes baby to stop eating so baby is crying on me while I’m trying to hold the toddler and not disrupt the two people I’m sitting next to. Plus my husband got stuck behind the beverage cart so he could grab the toddler for 20 minutes. 

Later, my husband gets up to pee again while I’m feeding baby and same thing happens of trying to feed baby with a toddler on my lap. Ending up with a crying baby and a toddler in one middle seat.


Back story, my husband pees a lot. I’ve worked with a pelvic floor therapist and told her how frequently he pees and she agrees it’s too much and he should work with PT to avoid issues down the road. He says he doesn’t need help and blames it on drinking lots of water.

After the flight, I told my husband how hard it was to balance both boys and asked if he can just hold his pee. So many times I have to pee when I’m watching the boys but hold it until timing is better. He said he can’t.

Next, I asked if he could ask me before he pees and go when baby isn’t nursing and I have two hands. He said no and he should be able to pee when he has to go. 

We have a full summer of flying ahead of us including a few international trips and I’m worried.

1dzhg1z,AITA for not allowing my kids a snack after dinner ,"I (28f) and my husband (32m) have 3 beautiful boys together aged 8, 7, and 4. Almost every evening we sit together at the table as a family and enjoy dinner. We have a strict rule that if you don’t finish your plate, you don’t get a snack later or dessert. If our kids are full before their plate is gone, we let them leave the table but save their plate in case they ask for a snack later. This really hasn’t been an issue until recently and specifically tonight where my husband and I got into a fight in front of the kids disagreeing if they could have a snack or not after dinner. For background purposes, financially I would say we are equal when it comes to income. My husband makes twice as much as me and pays all of the bills except the mortgage. I pay the mortgage, our youngest’s daycare, and I buy our groceries and any household necessities. We don’t fight about finances. Recently my husband has been not allowing the kids to have a snack after dinner even if they finish their plate. I’ve been arguing back saying “they finished, they’re allowed a snack.” Tonight our 7 year old asked for a snack after dinner and my husband flipped saying “don’t ask again you’re not having any more food tonight.” I told him he was being unreasonable and snuck my 7 year old down to have a clementine and a banana. My husband thinks I’m the asshole for undermining his decision that the kids won’t have snacks but I think he’s being unreasonable and if we have the means to fed our kids dinner and snacks after why wouldn’t we? So am I the asshole? 

(Edit I titled this wrong, I let my kids have a snack after dinner, my husband didn’t sorry)

INFO: My kids snack freely throughout the day. We give them small portions at dinner. The reason we keep the plate if they don’t finish is because they will sometimes have a bite or two of dinner and say they’re full, then minutes later ask for dessert.",left_butt_cheek,3364,0.8899999856948853,2074,1720569144,2024-07-09 18:52:24,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dzhg1z/aita_for_not_allowing_my_kids_a_snack_after_dinner/,7,2024
1e53bxy,AITA for not moving so a child to sit down on public transport? ,"There is public transport where I live (Subway) and like anywhere, it’s generally understood you give up your seat for someone who is elderly, disabled, or pregnant. I always try to do this.

I was sitting down on the Subway this week and who I assume were parents (mom, dad) with two kids got on. There was one available seat which one child sat on, and then the mom asked if I could give up my seat for the other child.

I politely refused and said something along the lines of ‘sorry I don’t want to give up my seat, I’m on this train for a long time’ (which is true, it’s a long journey for me).

Another part of the reason, even though it’s embarrassing and I didn’t say, is that I have bad blisters on my feet at the moment. 

The mom responded ‘wow, you wouldn’t give up your seat for a child?’ 

I said that I wouldn’t, and then someone else on the train gave up their seat. 

Even if I hadn’t had blisters on my feet, I still don’t think I would have given up my seat for a child. They don’t have problems standing, and probably have better balance than most adults. I know I have a bias here because I’m purposefully child free and my pet peeve is parents who feel they or their children are entitled to be the priority. 

While this was happening, everyone on the train was looking at me like I’m a massive ass. So Am I the Asshole? 

________

EDIT: thanks everyone for your thoughts, didn’t expect this to blow up! The consensus seems to be NTA but a few people have said it depends on the age of the child, or that I should’ve said I had blisters, which is fair. I’m not great at telling ages of children but maybe he was 7? He was definitely able to stand on his own well- I just googled 7 year old child and the images there seem about right. 

Also just to clarify, I do not hate children at all. I made a choice not to have kids and I don’t think people who made that choice should take priority over me, but I’m not a kid hater at all. I support everyone’s right to choose whether or not they have kids. 

Interestingly lots of people assumed I’m a man. I’m a 33 year old woman.

1edsnjz,AITA for decline my Step Dad's call when they couldn't find me at my Step Brother's wedding?,"I (27F) was at my stepbrother's (29M) wedding a couple of days ago. For some context, my mum (59F) and his dad (57M) have been together for 10+ years at this point. My stepbrother even included my mum in the family photos at the wedding and thanked her for looking after his dad in his speech. I could not be happier for her as this meant a lot to her. However, I was not included in family photos. This hurt me a little but it was his and his now wife's day so I'm not going to complain and I certainly would never bring it up to them or anyone else other than my partner. Especially not to my mum who was so shocked and happy that she was included. 

Anyways, this leads on to the matter at hand. My stepdad was talking to the brides mother later in the night whilst I was sat near them, half listening and bopping along to the music. The brides mum says to him that its lovely to have my stepbrother in the family and that now she has 4 children instead of two (both her daughters are now married). This is when my step dad turned around and said that he feels the same and he is very proud of his four. (My two stepbrother and both their wives). This instantly felt like a dagger to my gut (I should probably add that my mums previous partner said to my face as a 7 year old that he never wanted to be a father to me when I asked if I could get him a fathers day card, plus my own father left when i was two and was abusive for context as to why this hurt me so much) and my mum started questioning if I was okay. I said I was fine and to leave it but she kept badgering me and then asked me if I had been eavesdropping when I shouldn't have been. I barely nodded when she said she had heard it too and said that it hurt her too but that he hadn't been thinking. Her comforting me set me off with tears that I'd been trying hard to keep in so I got up and said I was going outside for some air. 

  
I went outside and walked a little bit away and had a cry to myself. I even sat on a swing at the small playpark near and in eyesight of the hotel. When I got myself together I was walking back when my Step dad rang me. I could see him and mum in front of the hotel, he then rang me and I waved and declined the call but they did not see me. My mum questioned me when I did walk back inside the hotel asking if I declined the call to which I replied yes. She then told me that was a stupid thing to do. I tried to explain that I could see them and waved at them but she said they could not see me. 

The next morning, my stepdad did apologise and say he messed up but I'm still a little upset. I've not said anything to my mum about how I'm feeling cause I know she will just tell me to move on and let it go. Am I the asshole? Should I have just answered the phone? Was I being petty?

1ebeh6m,AITA for not allowing MIL and SIL into the third floor of my house?,"I(36F) have been married to my husband(37M) for 12 years. We have 2 kids (9F and 6F).

You should keep in mind that in Muslim marriages, his money is our money, but my money is my money. He can't ever tell me what to do with it, neither can he force me to share expenses. Also, there is no community property/money, if it doesn't have your name on it, you have no right to it.

Before we got married, my husband lived in a house that he co-owned with his mom and sister, and according to him, they would visit maybe 10 days a year (combined).

Suddenly, when we got married, they would come to ""their house"" every other weekend. I complained to my parents, and they advised me to not sink any money into the house. My dad helped me to buy a plot of land, and I spent my money (since my husband covered almost 90% of our expenses) to build my own house. It's a 4 story house (think NYC buidlings, with garages on the ground floor).

Fast foreward to last April, and suddenly his sister decided that she wants to move into ""her house"". They are a family of 5, and there was no way we would have been able to live in a 3 bedroom house. Let alone how they were disrespectful, and juat did not believe in privacy.
 
I told my husband that I will be moving with the kids to my house, and he is free to come with if he wants (he used to insist we stay in that house as a matter of principal, I was just waiting to finish building my house). He agreed.

Last weekend MIL, SIL and her kids came to ""visit"", we gave them a short tour, then we stayed on the first floor that didn't have bedrooms.

After lunch they wanted to nap, so I set the living room for them, they were upset, and wanted to use the kids bedrooms (like they used to do before), I refused. It escalated, and I told them this is my house, I make the rules, and the rules are the third floor is for my immediate family only.

1dxsnxf,AITA for refusing to help my brother pay for his wedding after he hijacked my graduation party?,"So, I (23F) just graduated from university a few weeks ago. My family threw me a small party to celebrate, and I was really looking forward to it because I'm the first in our fam to get a degree. My older brother, Jake (28M), has always been the favorite, but I've tried not to let it get to me.

Anyway, Jake and his fiancée, Lisa (26F), show up to the party. Everything's going great until Jake decides to give a toast. At first, it's all nice and congratulatory, and then BOOM—he drops the bomb that he and Lisa are getting married in two months. The whole room goes nuts, and just like that, my graduation party turns into their engagement party.

I was totally blindsided and honestly pretty hurt. I mean, I get it, weddings are exciting, but couldn't he have waited for a different day to announce it? I sucked it up and put on a brave face for the rest of the night, but it definitely stung.

Fast forward to last week. Jake and Lisa come to me asking for help with their wedding expenses. They know I've been saving up from my part-time job and side hustles, and they just assumed I'd be down to chip in. I straight-up told them no. I said after what happened at my graduation, I didn't feel like helping out.

Jake and Lisa flipped out, calling me selfish and saying I'm holding a grudge. My mom thinks I should help because ""family helps family,"" but my dad actually backs me up, saying I have every right to feel the way I do.

Now Jake's been telling the whole extended family that I'm being petty, and some of them have been hitting me up, saying I should just get over it and help him out. Others are on my side, saying Jake was way out of line.

1ebgfa3,AITA for excluding my girlfriend from my birthday celebration because of what she said?,"I (23M) just had my birthday this past Sunday. I celebrated in part by meeting up with my aunt (45F) for brunch. My aunt and I share our birthday and have always spent at least part of the day together. It’s a tradition that’s really important to both of us. 

A couple weeks ago, my girlfriend (23F) said she wanted to throw me a birthday party, especially since now we have enough fun money to spend on something like that. I said that would be great, but it probably couldn’t be on my birthday-day, since I was meeting my aunt for brunch and then had to go into work early the next day, so an evening party would have to end early too. 

We then had a long discussion that turned into an argument over having a celebration on the actual day or not. It became clear that she wanted me to reschedule brunch and that was my line. I told her that time with my aunt on our birthday is more important to me than spending it with anyone else (part of her reason for having it that day was that a few friends would be in town then but not the following weekend). 

I told her part of the reason why it matters, which is that my aunt was a twin and her twin died when they were teenagers. Their birthday was hard for her and then, when I was unexpectedly born on the same day (I was premature), it made the day easier for her to handle. She never put all that on me as a kid, but told me when I was an adult how grateful she was that we were “birthday buddies” and that it had felt like a blessing. My aunt is an amazing lady and I have always loved sharing our birthday. I was even more glad when she told me all of that. 

When I told this all to my girlfriend though, her first reaction was that it was “messed up that your aunt uses you as an emotional crutch and that you’re a grown man who can make his own plans”. I think my feelings must have shown on my face because she tried to backtrack or qualify her statement or whatever, but I wasn’t having it. I told her that there was no need to throw me a birthday party at all. 

What I ended up doing was having the brunch as planned with just me and my aunt, and then my parents had a cookout with a lot of our family there. I didn’t invite my girlfriend and when I explained why, my family was kind of split. They all agreed that what she said wasn’t nice or true, but some thought that it also wasn’t kind to exclude her from my birthday entirely when it had clearly mattered to her. 

She and I have hung out both before and after my birthday and there is a tension there. Part of me wants to address it but I also don’t feel bad about what I did, so I don’t know if bringing it up would do much good. 

AITA?

Editing to clarify some things:

- girlfriend and I started dating last December, so it’s been nearly 8 months

- I didn’t want to write out the very long conversation we had where we tried to make plans around the existing time constraints (the brunch was already planned and we knew what the out of town friends’ schedule would be - that sort of thing) but we did try to consider it from every angle before it became clear to me she wanted me to move the brunch 

- the cookout was planned after I told her that she didn’t need to plan any birthday party for me. Basically, my mom called asking if I had plans and offered to host a cookout that day. My family has cookouts/get togethers at least twice a month, so they’re very lowkey, even if there’s a birthday happening, and also my girlfriend had been to several of the cookouts before, so my family was a little surprised she didn’t come. 

- I appreciate that y’all think our birthday buddy tradition is sweet - it has always meant a lot to me. I do want to make it clear that I’m not just doing it to make her happy - it’s something I also look forward to every year. Growing up, my aunt was the cool aunt that all the cousins wanted to hang out with, and I loved this special thing we did (and don’t worry, she does fun/special things with all my cousins and her own kids now, one of our fun/special things just happens to be our birthday.) She has never treated me like a replacement for her twin and she is in no way the AH in this situation.

1e49bdy,AITA for refusing to drive my fiancée to the train station after he missed his bus,"My (24F) fiancée (25M) has ADHD and has a difficult keeping a schedule which often results in him sleeping past his alarm. Today he was supposed to catch the bus at 7:30am but missed it.

I work shiftwork and had just finished my third 12 hour night shift in a row. My commute home is about 45 mins, so I got home just before 8:00am, and woke up my fiancée upon entry. He was upset with himself right away as he usually is when he sleeps in. 

We’ve had this issue in the past and I’ve previously told him that if he really needed a ride to the train station, I would prefer to pick him up at the front door (we live in an apartment) because once I’m parked in the garage and make it upstairs I’m tired and prefer not to leave again at this point (which I’ve still done in the past for him). I would say I probably drive him at least once every 2 weeks when he’s late.

He asked me if I’d drive him to the train station today, which would save him a 30 minute walk for his already long 1.5hr commute, but I declined. I was hesitant at first, but decided that I deserve to put myself first. He seemed upset, and did make a comment saying “I better see you in bed in 2 minutes then”, but eventually went on his way. Approx 30 mins later, he texted me saying that he knows it wasn’t good timing but that he really could’ve used the drive today. 

Later today he called and I expressed to him how I was upset by this. He said he was also upset because I wasn’t there for him when he needed me and that he would’ve done it for me if the roles were reversed, and that he was scared there was a limit to how much he could lean on me. Also that he hopes I’m happy that I got what I wanted and for me to enjoy my extra 30 mins of sleep.

To be fair, I’m not working today, so I’m able to sleep in later and it would’ve only taken me about 30 mins in total. I feel a bit guilty as realistically it wouldn’t have been that much of a burden to drive him and it means it would help him out a lot. I know he’s been having a rough time lately and worked 7 days this week, and is already angry with himself as is.",steinmatron,1834,0.9399999976158142,992,1721085303,2024-07-15 18:15:03,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e49bdy/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_fiancée_to_the/,7,2024
1efehhz,WIBTA if I didn’t let my sister wear her wedding dress to my wedding?,"Three years ago, my sister’s (36F) fiancé died in a work accident, 4 months before they were supposed to get married. They had been together for a long time and had a kid together, the only reason they didn’t marry earlier is money. This was obviously a horrible experience for her, and she’s understandably very upset about never having gotten to marry the love of her life. 

I (27M) recently got engaged. At first I was pretty hesitant to bring up the wedding around my sister, because I didn’t want to upset her or bring up any bad memories, but she was really excited about it and immediately started helping me to plan. She loves weddings, and pretty clearly was interested in my wedding being similar to her own idea of a perfect wedding. I didn’t mind this, because I’m not nearly as good at this type of thing and she took my vetoes with grace. 

A week ago she brought up the idea of her wearing the dress she bought for her own wedding to mine. My mother, who’s usually very strict on traditions like not wearing white to a wedding, thought it was a great idea. She argued that because I’m marrying another man, no one would mistake her for the bride, and it would let my sister have the wedding experience she always wanted. 

I think she’d stand out a lot like that. My sister will be my maid of honour (best woman?) and the plan was for her dress to match my financés best man.

I did do my best to be conscious of my sister’s loss. I don’t mind something to honour her fiancé, like an empty chair or a memorial table dedicated to him. I offered her some bride experiences that she missed out on like the father daughter dance. I just feel like a full wedding dress is a lot, and the idea makes me a bit uncomfortable. I feel bad for being bothered by it because a wedding isn’t nearly important to me as it is to her- I’d have been fine just getting legally married with no ceremony or anything, so I don’t know why the thought of my sister wearing what she wants upsets me. 

I know my sister would accept it if I said no, but she’s so excited about the idea and she’s pretty set on never remarrying so this is probably her only opportunity to wear this dress. I brought up to my mom that I was hesitant to say yes and she got really upset with me, and accused me of being jealous of her and needing all the attention. WIBTA?

1edt84o,AITA for refusing my parents' request to be trustee for my brother's inheritance?,"Throwaway account.  Context: I (45M) have one brother (40M).   My parents (71M,F) both had successful careers and have accumulated enough wealth that they need to do estate planning.  I got very lucky and have had a lucrative finance career that has left me quite a bit wealthier than they are (which they know, roughly).  My brother and his wife both work for non-profits, but have climbed their respective org charts and have a good middle-class income.  My parents have helped them from time to time, for example with a downpayment for a house when they got married and private school tuition for my young nephew.  He’s a little more into shopping and costly hobbies  than I am – but I live an unusually spartan life. Brother and I have a good relationship, though we live on opposite sides of the country, so we only get together a few times a year. 

When my parents last visited me, they pulled me aside to tell me about their estate plans.  They intend to leave everything to my brother and his family, because I’m already financially set and because they don’t want a giant disparity in wealth between their two sons.  I’m entirely fine with that.  It’s their money, obviously; I don’t need any; and I love my brother and his family and want them to be comfortable.  I told my parents as much – so far so good.

Here's where it got problematic.  Parents said, “it’s a lot of money and we don’t want it to just drop in \[Bro’s\] lap.  So we are setting up a trust to receive the money, to benefit \[Bro\] and then \[nephew\].  We want you to be the Trustee. ”  I told them that wasn’t going to be possible.  I don’t want to superintend my brother’s finances.  It seems like a recipe for strife and division. If I just let him do what he pleases and the money is dissipated, he could resent that I didn’t invest it better or exert more control; if I am conservative about disbursements, then he could resent my “heavy hand.”   I also told them that while my bro is not quite the penny-pincher I am, he is far from irresponsible with money (or generally).

My parents reacted poorly.  They claimed that it is not a big ask.  I said that, actually, it is kind of a big ask for me to serve as Trustee for who-knows-how-long , and that the one sliver lining of getting no inheritance should be that I don’t need to be involved in the estate.  I offered to refer them to a professional trust company. They accused me of refusing out of jealousy.  That was too much for me, so I pulled out my banking app and showed them that what was just sitting in my checking account was close to their estate (to be honest, had just received a large deferred comp wire from my firm, so it was unusually large –but, look, I was annoyed at their accusation and wanted to rebut it as quickly and convincingly as possible).  When we parted, it was a little tense and my mom said, “well, I guess we were wrong to think we could count on you.”

Now I am thinking maybe I should just suck it up and do it.  AITA?",Illustrious_Ball3004,1656,0.9599999785423279,249,1722121537,2024-07-27 18:05:37,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1edt84o/aita_for_refusing_my_parents_request_to_be/,7,2024

1ec8er0,AITAH for kicking my friend out of my party when he hooked his ps5 up to my TV?,"Last weekend I (24m) threw a house warming party with 30ish of my friends. I supplied drinks and food and had games set up and what not. 

One friend came with a big backpack. Initially I said to him “oh man you didn’t have to bring anything” but then he slid a PlayStation 5 out of it. I’m not gonna lie, I was immediately ticked off… it wasn’t really a video gaming party… but I didn’t wanna control how people enjoyed themselves so I let him hook up his PlayStation and start playing. I didn’t tell him what kind of party it was besides saying house warming and approx 30 people, but I just thought he’d know I wouldn’t be on the couch with him playing ps5.

This is where I’m wondering if I’m the asshole. As the party progressed, I was getting increasingly annoyed by having him on the couch with Call of Duty blasting on the TV. Everyone else was close by to the TV talking and playing beer pong and it just kinda embarrassed me. I didn’t say anything to him though until he started to get visibly annoyed by people passing in front of the TV. I sat beside him and said “if you’d rather be home playing video games you have no obligation to be here”. He laughed it off and kept playing. A bit later I asked him to be my partner in beer pong, and he said he’d rather keep playing ps5. I kinda just turned my TV off at that point and told him to go home. He left quickly and in a bad mood, and people saw what happened. I immediately felt guilty and he hasn’t responded to me in days.

1ec7hm9,AITA for telling off my parents for giving my young kids a hard time about speaking a foreign language in front of them?,"Burner for privacy. I am American. My wife is from a foreign country, though she did her post-secondary studies in the US.  She comes from a small country, the language of which is not widely spoken elsewhere.  Once our relationship got serious, I decided to learn her language.  I’ve always had an interest in languages and a facility for learning them (I speak two others besides English and my wife’s).  With her and her family’s help, I’ve become near-fluent!   When we had kids (twin boys, 8), we decided to raise them to speak both languages, partly so they could communicate more easily with their relatives on my wife’s side and partly as a way to keep them connected to m wife’s culture.  A few years ago, we bought a small vacation property in my wife’ country, where we spend a couple of weeks each summer, which has both helped my and my kids’ facility with the language and has in turn been made more enjoyable *because* we all speak the language.

For reasons I can’t quite get to the bottom of, this has always seemed to irritate my parents.  They were sour about the fact that some of the toasts at our wedding were in my wife’s language (we translated).  My mother, a former teacher, claimed that attempting to raise the kids bilingual risked causing language delays generally.  I told them that I appreciated their concern, but that we had done our research and felt like it would be good for the kids, but they kept bringing it up for the first few years of the kids lives, until it was clear they were both highly precocious in verbal skills. 

These days, we speak a mix of both languages at home.  The kids will often speak to each other in wife’s language, often preferentially so when they are just sorting something between themselves.  The problem is that my parents get annoyed when they hear it.  They justify it on multiple grounds, all flimsy in my view: that if they are watching the kids, they need to know what they are talking about in order to properly supervise; that they could be using it as a “secret language” to say disrespectful things; that if we allow it with them, they’ll do it at school and anger teachers or peers.  It’s never proved a problem for anyone but my parents.

Parents were over recently and one kid spoke to the other in the foreign language. I was in the other room and heard my mom gently reprove them to the effect of “it’s rude to speak in a language we can’t understand; I need to tell you this because you’re parents won’t.”  At that point I had enuogh and I stormed in and told my parents that they need to drop it.  They can have lots of 95% English time with their grandkids, or they can insist on 100% English and have 95% less time.  My dad got upset and said that they were only looking out for the kids because we have a “blind spot” about this and that I should apologize to my mother.  I rolled my eyes and said “sorry” in my wife’s language, which got a laugh out of my kids, but caused my parents to up and leave.  AITA?",Intrepid-Skill6615,1368,0.949999988079071,540,1721945310,2024-07-25 17:08:30,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ec7hm9/aita_for_telling_off_my_parents_for_giving_my/,7,2024
1ed0y52,AITA for making my husband care for our baby while he has a headache?,"I (29F) and my partner (27M) have been together for seven years and have a child together, 1M. He’s about as challenging as you’d expect a one year old to be but he’s easy to play with, eats well, and sleeps well. We both work full time- him at home and me in a nonprofit. Our son goes to daycare. When we are all at home, I generally do the cooking/cleaning/childcare/waking up with baby. I occasionally ask for help with chores and childcare, with on and off success. Frequently, my partner is too busy or “doesn’t want to” (cooking, specifically), or is working out of town. Recently he even took a three week boys trip. 

I am in the final stages of applying for a job with the government. I’ve worked my butt off from freshman year in university to have this job and I am taking it extremely seriously.

I am not a quick writer and this is not my strong suit so I was hoping to get it done tonight, and that way if I needed more time I could work on it tomorrow, or the next day. 

I went to let my partner know I’d be leaving our son home while I went to the library to do the essay (I know if I stay home the baby is going to get sent into the room). He was in bed and said no, he had a headache, and needed to rest. He didn’t sleep well and had to work today. I let him know that this is extremely important to me and I don’t want to rush. He ignored me. I let him know, again, I’m leaving. He is upset with me that he is feeling awful and I am still putting the work on him.

1e53cr5,AITA for Canceling my Daughter’s Date Last Minute?,"The number one rule in our (Me, 48M; my wife, 46F) house is no dating until you’re sixteen. Our son had to wait, our elder daughter had to wait, and we’ve made it clear to our youngest daughter that she has to wait too.

She’s only twelve right now (going into 7th grade this fall). She’s never really complained before about the no-dating rule, but a few nights ago she told me she was going to the movies with “a friend”. Yes, she *told me*, rather than asking if she could go. She said the friend’s sibling was dropping them off and picking them up, so I didn’t need to do anything.

I asked how long the movie was and which friend she was going with. Normally I wouldn’t have let her go (it was less than half an hour before she was supposed to leave, and I like to know plans at least a day in advance. But since it’s summer and she’s been pretty bored recently, I figured I’d let it slide).

She said the movie went past ten, and since we live pretty far from the theater she wouldn’t be home until around eleven. I asked again which friend it was (I would only trust her out this late with her best friend‘s sister, who babysat her for years). She was very vague and didn’t mention a specific name, so I told her she couldn’t go.

After complaining for a while, she caved and told me a boy she’d met had invited her and she was really looking forward to it. I reminded her of the no-dating rule (though she claimed “it’s not a date!”) and said she could go on a date with him in four years if he were still interested. I also allowed her to text him and cancel.

She cried and slammed the door to her room, saying stuff like she really likes him and was looking forward to it so much.

When my wife got home we talked about it, and she agreed that cancelling the date was the right decision.

However, a couple days later we got an angry call from the boy’s parents. (By the way, they got my number from the school listing, which is where I later found out my daughter met him). They said their son had bailed on a family event, and the least I could do was pay for another date for the two of them.

I said she couldn’t go and I was sorry, but had she told us about the date sooner I would’ve cancelled sooner. They angrily hung up.

1eh0jz1,AITA for not saying anything when my son was being picked on?,"My 10yo son Dylan is a bit abrasive with his friends but is very fun to be around. We're lucky enough to have a lot of families on our block with classmates of Dylan. A couple of days ago, he had a few of his friends over and they all reeked. I didn't say anything because I knew their parents would the minute they came home and would fix it.

I told Dylan he needed to start using deodorant and he said he really didn't. I said yes you do and I'll put some on you if you don't. Today he was outside wrestling with his friends and didn't put any deodorant on. His friends told him he smelled and to go back inside. They lobbed insults at each other and Dylan came inside crying.

I later told him that it was his fault for not putting on deodorant and your friends weren't wrong. He asked why I didn't tell his friends to stop picking on him and I said because I knew it would hurt you enough to where you'd put deodorant on. He said I was a mean dad.",Careless_Moment6532,1196,0.9399999976158142,265,1722465230,2024-07-31 17:33:50,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1eh0jz1/aita_for_not_saying_anything_when_my_son_was/,7,2024
1e11zyq,AITA for not sharing my inheritance with my half-siblings?,"I (32M) recently lost my father to cancer. It's been a difficult time, but I'm trying to cope. In his will, my father left me his house and a significant amount of money. This was unexpected, as I thought he didn't have much.

Here's where it gets complicated. My parents divorced when I was 5, and my dad remarried when I was 10. He had two children (now 20F and 18M) with my stepmother. Growing up, I saw my dad every other weekend, but we weren't particularly close. He seemed more involved with his ""new"" family.

Now that the will has been read, my stepmother and half-siblings are furious. They claim my father promised them he'd ""take care of everyone"" and are demanding I split the inheritance equally among all three of us kids.

I don't want to. While I'm not close with my half-siblings, I don't dislike them. But I feel like this inheritance is making up for years of my dad being less present in my life. Plus, I have student loans to pay off and was hoping to use some of the money for a down payment on a house.

My stepmother is threatening legal action, though the lawyer says the will is solid. My mom thinks I should keep it all, but some friends say I'm being greedy and should share with my half-siblings.

1dzh963,AITA for objecting to my roommate having guests stay overnight for 5 days?,"I live in 3 bedroom house with three roommates, and we are all in the Navy.

 One of the guys has had his fiance living with us for the past week, and he also dropped on me today, saying that he is having his Mom and two sisters(19F & 7F) coming into town. I said, “Cool, where are they staying?” he replied that they were staying at our house on the pullout bed in the living room.

I obviously objected to this because our house isn't that big, the living room is connected to the kitchen, and because we are in the Navy, we are up and about at 6 AM, which means we would cause a stir. It also means I won't be able to wind down at the end of the day and watch TV in the living room.

I then suggested they stay at the Navy Lodge, which is FAR cheaper than places out in town, and he brushed off my idea and said, “Well, they are to see me.” 

It's frustrating how someone can be such a cheap ass (especially since he's an officer), stubborn, and inconsiderate. I told him I wasn't ok with this arrangement, and then we got into a fuss, and he thought I was the one being unreasonable.

What do you think?

Any ideas on how to delicately approach this?

My wife is Asian and I am Caucasian.
Our daughter is taking time to come into her own and the Doctors feel an autistic diagnosis may be forthcoming when she gets a little older. She is well behaved though and just has some issues with her speech and development and isn’t quite where other kids her age are. Our son is a very good looking boy. It’s all people talk about when seeing him. He has unique features and that exotic mix of both races where his sister has more of an Asian look. 
My MIL is as shallow as a puddle and is obsessed with taking our son out and showing him off to her friends and just keeps going on about how good looking he is. 
I have recently stopped her taking him on outings because she is embarrassed about our daughter and the fact she is not a typical 4 year old. She only wants to take our son anywhere. 
I’m not having it and she is accusing me of stopping her relationship with her grandson because she doesn’t feel our daughter cares about a relationship with her or anyone because of her mental development. 
I have said that’s not the case and she needs to be treated the same.

1dx2w79,AITA for kicking my step daughter out?,"My husband and I are happily married and have one child together. He has one daughter from a previous relationship. We get along great with his ex and her husband. They weren't together long as they were lifelong friends who briefly tried dating and realized they were better as friends, even after the birth of their daughter.

Everyone gets along with the exception of their daughter, who really doesn't get along with anyone. She stayed with her aunt and when she left a couple weeks later, her cousin had to start therapy. The aunt went low contact with all of us. Her grandmother stopped having her for more than a couple days because her blood pressure can't take it.  She's been in therapy, asked if something has happened to her, but she is just defiant. She has been diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder.

Her mother and step father have started therapy because of the constant stress of having her around. We told them that of course we would have her stay with us. 

It's been miserable. She goes out of her way to do the opposite of what anyone asks her to do. Refuses to do basic chores i.e. picking up her own trash and dirty clothes. We gave her the household chore of vacuuming once a day in the three rooms that have carpet. It takes maybe fifteen minutes. We found out she ""traded"" our son then complained when she was caught that it wasn't fair he got the easier job of watering two plants. We told her that not only is he only 8 yo but he is developmentally delayed and has muscular dystrophy and can barely push the vacuum. Not only that but he's nonverbal and couldn't tell her no. He just did as he was told.

The last straw was when I went into her room to put clothes away and noticed her pile of leftover food and wrappers. Id told her multiple times it needed thrown away. I decided to do it that time because it was starting to mold and she would lose food in her room privileges. I picked it up and there were a couple roaches. We called an exterminator and he said, they were only in her room and we were lucky to find it early and it most likely happened because instead of throwing her trash away, she just threw it out the window and left the window open. 

My husband says we shouldn't have kicked her out because now resents us and feels like we are giving up on her. I said I understood that as a parent but at what point does she have to stop making all of us miserable? Besides I think the best thing is to finally make her take some responsibility for herself and despite efforts with therapy, attempted quality time, punishments, encouragements, he is just enabling her at this point. Ultimately, I purchased the house prior to marriage and it's still in my name. I refuse to have my son live with someone who will take advantage of him and live in a house with roaches and mold. My husband and I are starting therapy soon for ourselves as well because of this and she is staying with the second friend because the first made her leave.

1dt5i7m,"AITA? My sister, recently divorced after 11 years, raised her husband’s child from infancy after the mother passed away, and now she believes our family should sever all ties with the child.","My sister married a widower shortly after his wife passed away from cancer, and she effectively became ‘Mom’ to his 6-month-old son, Josh, whom she raised as her own. They also had a child together, Sam. Unfortunately, my sister and her husband divorced two years ago after 11 years of marriage, and while we’ve tried to maintain a relationship with Josh by sending birthday cards and holiday gifts despite living 1200 miles away, my sister hasn’t kept in touch with him.



Once he was born, my sister became entirely focused on Sam, who now has no contact with his father. From my perspective, Sam avoids anyone who disciplines him, including his father, leading to the stress in their family dynamics that ultimately lead to their divorce.



Recently, while visiting, we attended Josh’s basketball game and took him out for ice cream along with his father and his new girlfriend. My sister found out about this and cut off all contact with me, expressing her discontent through my daughter, stating she ‘likely won’t be able to get past this’ and that ‘after a divorce, cousins and uncles don’t come with it.’ My mother has also taken her side, upset that I ‘hurt’ my sister.



I’ve tried to apologize and reassure my sister that we didn’t discuss her or share anything about her with her ex, but she hasn’t responded. I even reached out on Mother’s Day without any response.



Am I in the wrong here? It’s not like we’re inviting her ex over for dinner or being overly friendly with him. It’s been two years, and she’s engaged to get married again. Considering past incidents, like when my sister conspired with my abusive ex to break into my house, I feel her reaction is excessive.



I just want to make sure I’m not being unreasonable. She hasn’t spoken to me directly about her feelings, choosing instead to message my daughter, which I found inappropriate.",soflobadpilot,1049,0.949999988079071,144,1719871604,2024-07-01 17:06:44,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dt5i7m/aita_my_sister_recently_divorced_after_11_years/,7,2024

**aita for exploding at my friend for not feeding my dog for a week because they believed a 'water fast' was healthy?**

Hi everyone,

I need to vent and get some perspective on something that has me absolutely livid. I recently went on a week-long business trip and asked my friend, who I'll call Jane, to pet sit my dog, Max. Jane has always seemed responsible and claims to love animals, so I trusted her without hesitation. I left detailed, explicit instructions on Max's feeding schedule, his favorite treats, and how to take care of him. I even stocked up on his favorite food and treats to ensure there would be no issues.

When I returned, I immediately noticed something was wrong. Max was unusually lethargic, his ribs were more pronounced, and he looked generally unwell. Alarm bells went off in my head, so I confronted Jane about what had happened. To my utter disbelief, she nonchalantly told me she hadn't fed Max ANY food the entire week. Why? Because she decided to put him on a ""water fast,"" claiming she read somewhere that it's supposedly healthy for dogs.

I was absolutely horrified. Jane, who has no veterinary training or knowledge, took it upon herself to ignore my clear instructions and subjected Max to what is essentially starvation. She calmly explained that she thought she was doing him a favor by letting his system ""detox."" I couldn't contain my anger and exploded at her, screaming that what she did was incredibly dangerous and irresponsible. Jane then had the audacity to get defensive, saying I was overreacting and that her intentions were good.

I rushed Max to the vet, and thankfully, he is on the mend, but the vet confirmed that the week-long lack of food could have caused severe health issues. I'm beyond angry and feel deeply betrayed by Jane. She has since apologized, but still insists that she thought she was doing the right thing.

AITA for trusting Jane to pet sit and for exploding at her for not feeding Max? Should I have been even more explicit about not doing anything out of the ordinary with Max's care, even though I thought my instructions were clear enough?

Thanks for your input.",Commercial-Sundae974,1040,0.9599999785423279,546,1721600083,2024-07-21 17:14:43,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e8y584/aita_for_exploding_at_my_friend_for_not_feeding/,7,2024
