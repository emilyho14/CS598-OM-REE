Reddit Submission: [MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy May Have Lasting Benefits for PTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/h0gxbd/mdmaassisted_psychotherapy_may_have_lasting/)

The article [""Long-term follow-up outcomes of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD: a longitudinal pooled analysis of six phase 2 trials""](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-020-05548-2) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-024-06665-y) from *Psychopharmacology* as of August 10, 2024. Concerns were raised about [unethical conduct by researchers](https://qz.com/1809184/psychedelic-therapy-has-a-sexual-abuse-problem-3) associated with the project at the MP-4 study site in Vancouver, Canada ([NCT01958593](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01958593)). The authors have since confirmed that **they were aware** of these violations at the time of submission but did not disclose this information to the journal or remove the data generated by this site from their analysis.

The authors also failed to disclose a conflict of interest. Several of the authors are affiliated with either the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) or MAPS Public Benefit Corporation (MAPS PBC), a subsidiary that is wholly owned by MAPS. MAPS fully funded and provided the MDMA that was used in this trial, and MAPS PBC organized the trial.
