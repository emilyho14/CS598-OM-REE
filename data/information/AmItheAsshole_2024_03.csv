1b9893v,AITA for taking my grandchildren to Disney for the first time without their mother and refusing to apologize when confronted?,"My son made this account and asked me to post this story, because he claims my normal meter is skewed and the internet is going to tell me I am an asshole.

I recently babysat my grandchildren (5 and 4) for a period of four nights and five days so my son and his wife could attend a wedding in Mexico, and spend a few days on vacation. They approached me since her mother would not be available, and I initially said I wasn't comfortable with that. It seemed like a long time to watch the kids, and she has point blank told me that the woman's family is more important than the man's, so I was irritated I was being asked and not her mother. I will admit that I did give in when my son became very emotional, but I felt/feel like they were being manipulative.

While I had the kids I was invited to a birthday at Epcot and wanted to go. It didn't even occur to me to run it by my son or daughter in law, as I had the kids for an extended period of time and obviously they knew they would be going where I went. My daughter in law had previously mentioned wanting to save up for Disney, but she's said that about a lot of things, and never made me aware it was something super special to her. Also it was Epcot. It's not like I took them to Magic Kingdom and they had some magical moment of seeing their favorite character. 

When they returned and found out my daughter in law was furious and burst into tears. She said I stole one of her kids first and called me entitled. To be honest I didn't react well to being called entitled, when she was the one who had previously demanded babysitting. My son asked me to apologize as she was distraught over missing their first Disney trip, but I declined and asked them to leave. 

My son reached out again and said I should have asked for something that big, and his wife feels robbed. I know she is a huge Disney person, but it was Epcot, not quintessential Disney and I don't feel I should have had to miss out on a birthday party I wanted to attend. I told my son I am not apologizing for anything and maybe they should think about how they made me feel when they didn't respect my initial no. My son feels like Reddit is going to show me the error of my ways.

1bfs9jt,AITA for telling my wife to get over my daughters short hair? ,"I(40M) and my wife(42F) have been married for 5 years. I have a 14 year old daughter from a previous relationship. Her mother wanted nothing to do with her when she was born. When I met my wife, she was worried about being a bad step-mother to my daughter. They became close and they do a spa day every mother's day. 

My daughter has very long hair down to her shoulders. She hates putting it up in ponytails and she complains about the length of time it takes to blow-dry. She's a big tom-boy and one of her friends recommended she gets a pixie cut. I booked her an appointment to get the cut she wanted and she was very happy. She's been in such a great mood and loves having the short hair. 

When I brought her home to see wife, my wife dropped what she was doing and looked like she was about to faint. She asked why I allowed daughter to cut all her hair off. I told her that this is the cut my daughter wanted. My wife got furious and started telling me about how I ruined daughter's image. I shot back at her to get over the hair-cut as it made daughter happy. That was all I wanted was my daughter to be happy 

My wife continued to complain about the haircut even around my daughter and I had to tell her multiple times to drop it. My daughter has been very depressed and it's worrying me. I have been giving my wife the cold shoulder and she's being very cold to both me and daughter.

1b481pf,AITA For Expecting My Wife To Do Most Of The Pool Upkeep?,"I (36m) and my wife (35f) purchased our house 3 years ago. When we were in the market for houses, my wife stated that she explicitly wanted a pool. I didn't really care too much for a pool, but we had a flexible budget so I guess why not? I requested though, that if we bought one, she would have to do 80% of the upkeep, if not all of it. She agreed. 

&#x200B;

FF to now. I've done 90% of the upkeep, and my wife had an excuse every time I ask her to help me clean the pool, or check the alkalinity or pH level of the pool, she always ""too tired"" or ""she'll do it later."" I let it happen the first couple times, but it's kind of getting frustrating now. 

&#x200B;

But luckily, I have two employees that are extremely helpful: My son (7M) and my daughter (6F). Very well paid, no complaints so far. Yesterday, my employees were using their time off to go to school, so I got to cleaning. Technically draining, but it took long enough that is was just about done by the time my wife got back home. 

&#x200B;

By the time we were heating to bed, I asked her if she could clean it on Saturday (or I could help) but she hit me with the ""I'm busy."" She doesn't work on Saturday. I got kidn of upset about it and told her that she should be doing 100% of the upkeep anyways and I'm going to stop taking care of the pool from now. 

&#x200B;

She just told me to stop bluffing and went to sleep. FF to this morning, and she doesn't even want to discuss anything pool related or even anything related with me.

1ba2tj3,AITA for saying I'm entitled to food my parents buy?,"Throwaway account

I'm going to keep this short. I'm in college and living with my parents. My parents had an oops baby. My sister is only 4. They can't afford childcare so instead of getting a part-time job to help out I take care of her when they're at work. 

We got into an argument because they haven't gone grocery shopping and we're running low on food. They used the last of the bread for themselves tonight and when I brought up what I would eat we got into an argument. They told me I'm grown and it's not their responsibility to feed me anymore. I told them that's bs and I'm entitled to food because I'm taking care of thier kid.

They're now calling me an entitled brat and saying if I don't fix my attitude they'll kick me out. I told them go ahead because then they'll be homeless because they can't afford childcare even with both of them working. My relatives are telling me I'm in the wrong because I am an adult and need to grow up.

1bq9tze,AITA for refusing to take any responsibility for my dog until my wife was forced to rehome him?,"I am going to lay this out of n the most basic way I can. 

I work from home. As does my wife. She wanted a dog. I said we did not have enough time to take care of a dog. She pestered me until I agreed. We took our time and found a rescue that had several pups that met our criteria. Small. Adult. Requiring just a couple of short walks a day. They did home visits and stuff. 

It was taking a while. During that time my wife found a farm that had working Blue Heeler X Border Collie pups. She got me one for my birthday. I had one just like her when I lived at home with my parents. 

She is a beautiful puppy but not in any way what we agreed on. We live in an apartment with no yard. My parents have an acreage. I a very busy. I do not have time for all the training and exercise that she needs.  I told my wife thanks but no thanks. She refused to listen to me. 

So I just refused to bond with the pup. I didn't even name her. I told my wife I would make sure that the pup was fed and got two half hour walks a day since that's what we agreed on. Everything else was on her. 

It took two weeks o barking, chewing, and pooping until she rehomed the pup. Now she is mad that I manipulated her into doing what I said we should do to begin with. She said she thought I would love a puppy that was like my old one. IF WE HAD THE SPACE AND TIME FOR HER I WOULD HAVE. I am pissed that I had to even do it. I feel bad for the dog. I'm thinking of not even doing the rescue now that I know more about how my wife thinks.",Expert_Royal913,6447,1.0,1,1711667776,2024-03-28 18:16:16,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1bq9tze/aita_for_refusing_to_take_any_responsibility_for/,3,2024
1bcfrxs,AITA for asking my mother to leave because she won't stop wasting my food.,"My baby sister just had a baby and our mom came to help. My sister and her husband live in a tiny apartment with no room for my mom. I agreed to let her stay with me since I live only eight blocks away. It's walkable. My plan was to Uber her over in the morning and pick her up after work. 

I only eat one meal a day during the week. Supper. I have coffee for breakfast and some fruit for lunch. On Saturday I treat myself to a good breakfast and Sundays I take the woman I'm dating for brunch. 

My mother decided that this was unacceptable. She got up early and went through my fridge and freezer to make me breakfast. 

I told her that I appreciate it but that I do not usually eat breakfast. She said that was stupid. I very clearly communicated to her that she was welcome to eat anything in my home but to please not make me breakfast as it was a waste. 

She made breakfast the following day. I walked out without eating it. I figured worst case scenario I could  eat it for supper. 

She threw it out since I didn't eat it. I told her once more to please not waste my food. 

She made breakfast for me the next day. I asked her if she was developing dementia. She is wasting my food for no good reason. I'm not poor or anything but wasting food is a pet peeve of mine. She said I was being ungrateful for her help and she was doing it to be nice since I was letting her stay with me. 

I explained to her again that I did not need, want, require, or desire breakfast during the week. She said she understood. 

She made me breakfast the next day. I had had enough. I took her luggage with me when I dropped her off at my sister's home. 

I told my doorman that my guest was no longer welcome. 

I got so many messages from her and my sister all day long. Even my dad called me to ask me to change my mind. I said no. 

He had to drive up and rent an Airbnb close to my sister because my mom was too scared to stay by herself. He's retired so he didn't miss work or anything. 

My sister came over alone to talk to me. She said I was being a complete ass and that I could afford the food my mom was wasting. I said I could but that I didn't want to. She literally used up two months worth of my food. She made up huge breakfasts that I didn't even eat. I keep all my bacon in individual servings. She thawed out three for every breakfast. One for her and two for me. And I ate zero. 

My father has asked me to let her back in. I said I would under the condition that she understand that my food is completely off limits to her. She can pay for her own food. I said I would make room in the fridge and freezer for her. She said I was being ridiculous and petty.  

So my dad is staying neutral but my mom and sister think I'm a jackass.

1bm6875,AITA for telling my mom that she's doesn't get to make the rules?,"I (17M) live with my three brothers (15M, 13M, 10M), and my ma (40F). We're not very well off. I pay almost half the rent, I pay for groceries more often than not, and I juggle having a job, going to school, and raising these three kids, one of whom is disabled.

I say raising, because my ma, between having two jobs and basically never being home, doesn't contribute. She's gone by 8am, and usually not back before 10 or 11pm. In the past year, she's been home even less, getting home later and later. I'm pretty sure she goes out drinking.

The fight went like this: My ma came home last night a bit before 9pm for once, instead of 11 or later as she's been doing. 15M came out of his room to say hi, and 13M was already on the couch reading something for school, so she hugged both of them, and said hi, and said she'd stopped by the gas station to buy us all something and gave us all a candy bar, which was cool of her. Then, she asked where 10M was, because she wanted to say hi to him.

Now, I've practically raised these kids on my own for years now. And I do my best. On the very rare occasion my mom comes home early, she usually just goes to bed.

I have 10M go to bed at 8pm, which I don't think is unreasonable, and I let the other two stay up until 10pm, because they're older. We all eat dinner at 6, get home from school around 4, and have a pretty clean routine altogether.

Now, my ma was asking where he was, so I told her he was asleep. She asked why, so I told her it's past his bedtime. She told me he didn't have to go to bed that early. I told her he did. She told me no he didn't, she'd said we could all stay up until 10. 

I said that doesn't work, and she told me she's the parent, and it does work. And then she said it's not my place to micromanage the other three. she said, her kids, her house, her rules. And then she exploded, that I could stop being such a control- freak, because it wasn't my place to do that, or to have signed up 13M for soccer, or to have repainted the fence, or to have taken 10M to the doctor some weeks ago, or any of the things I've been doing without asking her.

I told her, it's also my house, I pay a lot of rent, and they're basically my kids, because she's never around, so it's more my house, my rules, if we wanna play that game. I told her she wouldn't know what works for 10M, because she's too busy to know him. I told her I might ask for her input if she was ever around, but she never is, so I don't give a shit how she thinks I should raise these kids, and she doesn't get to have a say in it. Not anymore.

She broke down crying, called me ungrateful ""for all that she does"" said she ""doesn't know where she went wrong"" and left the room. She either went to her room or she fucked off and left the house, idk and idc. She's an adult, it's her life. 13M said I'm a dick for making her cry, and 15M left the room a minute later, saying he was going to bed.

1bsniht,AITA For not specifying that my sibling is a man?,"My older brothers name is Viktor but no one has ever called him that. Ever. Everyone calls him Vik. I call him Vikky, something I started as a kid. He's like ten years older than me, doesn't live at home, yada yada.

Anyway we're going on our family vacation in a week. I was allowed to invite a friend. I invited a friend from my dance class - we've gotten pretty close recently. I told her we'd be sharing a room with Vik. She was fine and we started planning our trip.

Anyway yesterday my friend came over - she's never met Vik, obviously, and our parents wanted her to meet him before we fly because he'll basically be responsible for us (our parents pair the kids off so they get to relax).

When she got introduced to him she immediately, like, freaked out, and told me she no longer wanted to go and got her parents to tale her straight back home. I was obviously upset and I didn't know what had happened.

She called me later and said shebwas upset because I'd never told her Vik is a man. I was confused because like, yeah, I'd never outright called him a man but I've definitely called him ""he"" before and referred to him as my brother.

I said this to her and she told me she never called me call him ""he"" (blamed my accent) and that she assumed ""brother"" meant my other brothers (I have seven).

She told me she doesn't feel comfortable sharing a room with a grown man for a week and no longer wants to come. I'm really, really upset, but feel like if it was that big of a deal for her she should have asked?

I told her she was being unreasonable. Like, fair enough she shouldn't go if she's uncomfortable, but it's not my fault she didn't ask. She thinks I should have been upfront about it.

My parents think I'm being mean, my brothers are divided. So AITA?

1bavkf0,AITA for leaving a barcrawl early without my girlfriend?,"I (27 M) just got home about 45 minutes ago and am currently dealing with my very pissed off gf (29 F). We have been dating since November after meeting off of hinge. 

Every year, the weekend before St Patrick’s day weekend, her friend from highschool “Dean” has a birthday barcrawl. A lot of people go; there must have been like 40 people there. My gf has known dean since highschool and she even dated him for a bit then. We are much older now so that doesn’t bother me. 

What bothered me is that my gf basically barely talked to me the entire time we were there. We got to the pregame around noon and went to the first bar at like 2 PM. She kept running off with her friends and I didn’t know a single person who was there. These aren’t friends she sees that often so I’ve never met them before. I spent most of my time at the first 3 bars looking for her. She was pretty drunk and hyper and I know she was looking forward to seeing these friends but it still felt like she ditched me. 

I even expressed to her that if she wanted to go without me it would be okay because I am kind of shy and not great with large groups of people i don’t know. She insisted that I go however so I did. Only for her to not be around me most of the time. 

When it came time to go to the third bar, I found her and told her I had an Uber coming back to my apartment and she can come over when she’s done. I said I didn’t care at all if she wanted to stay but I was done and didn’t really feel wanted at all. She tried to get me to stay but I insisted it was all good but I just wanted to leave.

1bbmrxj,AITA for telling my sister she doesn’t have a say in my nieces diet,"I adopted my 8 year old niece 5 years ago. Her parents just weren’t fit to be parents. They are still involved in her life as her aunt and uncle. 

My niece is homeschooled. She goes to a co op 4.5 hours a day, 4 days a week. I work 3 12 hour shifts a week so I usually need help getting her to and from co op 1-3 days a week. My sister works nights and is available to take her. Since it’s a bit of a drive back to the house, she usually hangs out at the co op and helps out with whatever they need. 

One mom at the co op makes lunches for the kids as her contribution. She has all of their allergy/dietary info and none of the kids have complained so far. Some examples of their lunches are turkey/ham sandwich, pb&j, mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, hot dogs, and occasionally pizza. 

She also gives them sides like a cracker (goldfish, cheezits, chips, ritz, veggie straws, etc.), some kind of fruit (fruit slices, fruit cups, apple sauce), some kind of dessert (fruit snacks, cookie, brownie, etc), and a drink (usually milk or juice). 

My sister told my niece that she doesn’t want her eating that crap and that when she takes my niece to co op, she’ll be packing my niece a lunch. Apparently she told my niece that carbs are bad for her and that these lunches will make her fat. 

My niece came to me upset about it because she likes those lunches and that’s what everyone else eats. I told her that my sister was wrong then sent her to play before calling my sister. 

My sister defended everything she said and I told her that if she has concerns about my nieces diet, she will need to speak to me about it, not my niece. I also told her that I am my nieces parent, not her, and that if she feels that she has the power to make unilateral decisions regarding her health without consulting me I will get her a babysitter that can take her to co op. 

A lot of my family is against me on this and says that it’s my sisters kid so she should have a say and that me getting a babysitter will be cruel to both my niece and my sister (she already stays with my neighbor during the day but my neighbor can’t take her to co op).

Amanda knows I am on her side and here to support any boundaries. She was concerned about how my mom would behave at the wedding and admitted to not wanting to spend any more time with her than absolutely necessary.

I ended up going to my mom's husband ""Chris"" and asking if he had any thoughts so we could all have  a peaceful day and no bridesmaids would need to ""accidently"" spill anything. At first he didn't want to help, but he didn't want my mom to feel embarrassed and gave in. He said it was already going to be a long day for her, so he recommended no pre wedding festivities and said he would get her out of the rehearsal dinner early, so she had enough time in between. He took her out right after dinner and took her somewhere else.

The day of the wedding she was not invited to get ready with the bridal party or have a champagne breakfast. Instead Chris took her to the beach for a long run (get that energy out) Then took her to a nice breakfast, home for some one on one attention, and let her know he had a special day planned the following day.

1ba03qq,AITA for uninviting my friend from my Oscar party over a bottle of whisky?,"All names are fake.

Me (29M) and my wife ""Kate"" (27F) host an Oscar watch party at our house every year. We've been doing that since we moved in together 5 years ago. We dress up well, place bets on the winners and eat popcorn. It's a fun tradition that many of our friends look forward to every year. One of those people is ""Rick"" (28M), a friend of mine from college.

My wife loves whisky. Shortly before last year's party, my FIL gave her a bottle of Macallan. He said he'd spent $175 on it. Kate gave birth to our first child in 2022 and was still breastfeeding last year, so she decided to save the bottle for after our son had weaned.

During last year's watch party, Rick got wasted. While reaching for something else in our liquor cabinet, he accidentally dropped and broke the bottle. He apologized profusely once he'd sobered up. I was angry, but the whisky was Kate's and she forgave him, so I decided to drop the subject.

A couple weeks after that, we asked Rick how he planned on replacing the bottle. He was shocked at our question, and told us he didn't intend to. Rick's been having money problems for a while and struggles to pay his rent. He said that since we knew about his condition, it was unreasonable of us to expect him to pay for a $175 bottle of whisky.

I told Rick he had until this year's Oscar party (which was months away at the time) to save up for a new bottle. If he didn't, he wouldn't be welcome at our place for the party. At the time, he agreed. Throughout the year, I asked him about the savings several times. He always told me he was close to the goal.

Last week, I asked Rick about it again. He confessed he hadn't actually saved any money for the bottle. So I kept my promise and uninvited him from the party.

Both Rick and his girlfriend (who frequently joins him at our parties) are now angry at me for uninviting him over a ""drunken mistake."" They also insist that I'm being unsympathetic and entitled by expecting Rick to pay for a new bottle.

Kate's on my side, but is worried we're being too harsh. I really don't think we are, but as Sunday approaches, I'm starting to feel guilty.

1bixndd,AITA for not forgiving my MIL after she gave away my late mother’s heirloom to a stranger?,"I (30F) am known in my family for my patience and generosity. I’ve always gone out of my way to help others, and I take pride in being a good person. My husband (32M) and I have a beautiful relationship built on mutual respect and understanding.  
My late mother left me a precious heirloom, a vintage necklace that has been in our family for generations. It’s not just valuable, but it holds immense sentimental value to me. I’ve always kept it safe and only wore it on special occasions, cherishing the memories it holds.  
Enter my MIL (57F), who has a history of overstepping boundaries. Despite our differences, when she lost her apartment, my husband and I opened our home to her, asking for nothing in return but basic respect for our belongings.  
One day, I came home to find my MIL hosting a tea party with her friends, and to my horror, one of her friends was wearing my mother’s necklace. When I confronted her, my MIL nonchalantly said she gave it away because she thought it was ‘just old jewelry’ and that her friend admired it.  
I was heartbroken and felt utterly betrayed. My husband was equally appalled and supported my decision to ask her to leave. Now, the rest of the family is painting me as the villain, saying I’m overreacting and should forgive her because ‘family is family.’  
So, AITA for not being able to forgive this breach of trust?",Cold_Device5620,4054,1.0,1,1710887897,2024-03-19 17:38:17,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1bixndd/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_mil_after_she_gave_away/,3,2024
1bfrtju,AITA for letting my wife’s friend quit causing her to lose multiple benefits totaling in $50k+?,"I (35M) worked with my wife’s close friend Sara (29F) who she has know since college. They were sorority sisters and my wife was her big and Sara was the little or something along those lines. Sara and I were in the same industry and she eventually applied for a position at the same Company I currently worked at. She got the job almost 3 yrs ago and we have been at the same midwestern office. She was apart of my team but I dealt very little with her directly and wasn’t her direct report. 

Sara had done very well and was promoted within 6 months to a good position. She seemed to be on a fast track but recently stumbled in her latest interview for a sought after position. We gave the position to a more deserving candidate in my eyes. As we sometimes see Sara was upset and it was the start of her leaving the company. I could sense she was applying elsewhere and did put in a 2 weeks notice, offered to stay on 1 month inline with her projects deadline, which we accepted. We wanted to keep Sara but I could not give her a raise because she was already at the top of her pay scale. Her job offer was actually lower pay so there was no leverage there either. I told her this within a few days and Sara was pretty upset. She decided to leave immediately.

Here is where the issue comes up. Sara was aggressive with her 401k and the company stock options by my recommendation. We have a 10% 401k match (very generous) and stock buying options (match stock purchases - basically a 2 for the price of 1 deal). She would tell me later she maxed the 401k and stock options every year. The problem is my company has a 3 yr vesting schedule before the matching is permanent. So if an employee leaves before both 401k and stock matching is gone. Sara’s 3yr anniversary was within the 1 month notice date but not when she abruptly quit. 

It something I realize between Sara’s notice and her quitting. I wasn’t able to advise her of this nor did I know how much she put into these program. There was really nothing I could do when she abruptly quit. 

It was about 2 months later Sara came over with my wife and laid into me. She tried transferring her funds and found out about the vesting period and asked if I knew. She revealed the amount she would be losing during the transfer of funds and it was greater than $50k. Both Sara and my wife have said I’m TA for not warning her. I told her the situation and how I did not consider her quitting immediately (in front of others too).

So AITA for not warning Sara that she was just short of the 3 yr vesting period that would’ve saved for $50k?

1blczql,AITA for not getting my “stepdaughter” a present?,"I (F40) got married to my ex-husband, James (M43), three years ago. He had a daughter, Annabel (F13) from a previous marriage. For background purposes, Annabel has next to no contact with her bio mother. She left when Annabel was two, and apart from the occasional birthday card, there’s no contact there.

I’ve known Annabel since she was nine, and we had a good relationship, especially in the absence of a maternal figure in her life. I never had children of my own and never intended to, but was surprised that I was fine with being in a relationship with someone with a child.

James, Annabel, and I lived together for four years in what you could consider the “normal” nuclear family. However, my relationship with James just got more and more strained. We were constantly arguing and bickering about really pointless things and the atmosphere in the house was sour. Annabel could tell and she became more withdrawn. Eventually, I told James I was leaving because I wasn’t happy in the house or the relationship. He was livid, swearing and shouting, saying that he didn’t want to see me again. I left and went to live with my sister until I found somewhere of my own.

This happened about three months ago, and I haven’t had any contact with James since then, other than to collect some things from the house. I asked how Annabel was, and he said she was fine, but didn’t really expand upon that. 

However, last week, I received an angry call from James saying how selfish and immature I’d been my not getting Annabel a birthday present. I knew it was her birthday but decided not to and haven’t tried to maintain a relationship with her because of the tension with James. James said how upset she was and that he couldn’t believe I put relationship issues over a 13 year old girl, who I knew didn’t have a mother. I told him he was being ridiculous and that if he wanted to cut me out of his life completely, that includes his daughter.

He said I was an asshole and a small gift or card would have meant the world to Annabel, before hanging up the phone. 

I sent Annabel a happy birthday text (the day after her birthday as the call was late), but she hasn’t responded.

1b5vv3d,AITA for not giving my sister $600 to come to my dinner at the fire station i work at,"Context: when you first get hired by the fire department the first 6 months are called probation. After you complete it you cook dinner at your station, invite your family and whoever else you want.

 I’d been telling my family since I first got hired that they ALL need to come. When I finally got the date I could have my dinner my 20 year old sister said she had tickets for a rave that day and cant change the dates anymore. This was an extrenely big deal to me and I’m very upset that she won’t just not go to the rave and come to my dinner. 

I rarely ask her to go places and she always flakes out and says she’s “tired” but has the energy to go out with friends every week. she then said if i gave her the money she spent then shed be able to go but also said id have to reimburse her boyfriend too, which i refused. not because i dont like him but because i dont want to pay 600 for my sister to come to an event i had been telling her about for months. She said unless i did that she can’t go, and im extremely upset and offended that my own damn sister would rather go to a rave then her brothers probationary dinner since this is like a wedding or graduation and not going is extremely messed up.  You go out to support your family cause you love them and want to be there for their accomplishments, seldom rarely do my other family members even fake smiles at these events but I know if it was the other way around I’d move heaven and earth to be there for my family’s big day.

1bmybct,AITA for not inviting my ex best friend to my wedding even though I was the MOH at hers?,"I (31F) had a friend Maria (31F) growing up. We met when we were about 8 or 9, and quickly became best friends. We started slowly growing apart in high school as our schedules changed and almost completely lost touch during college. By the time we were \~23, we only saw each other once a year at Christmas for our old friend group’s Christmas dinner.  


Maria got engaged to her high school sweetheart and asked me to be her maid of honor in the wedding. At the time she asked me, we had not seen or spoken to each other in almost 2 years, so it honestly shocked me when she asked, but I agreed. She asked me about a year before the wedding, and after she asked me to be MOH, she did not speak to me again for 6 months. I had taken it to mean maybe she wanted to rekindle our friendship and reached out a few times during those 6 months to meet up for lunch or hang out, but she never responded.  


When she finally texted me, it was to meet up with her and her best friend (one of the bridesmaids) to pick out the dresses for the bridal party. She showed up 3 HOURS LATE. Apparently, she and her friend decided to meet up for lunch and to hang out before meeting me at the mall, completely ignoring our agreed upon time and the fact that I had already said I was there and waiting for them. I’m not going to go into details of the next 6 months leading up to the wedding, but that should give you an idea of how it went. By the time the wedding day came, I genuinely felt so used and disrespected. On the day of the wedding, Maria was just mean. I waited until the speeches and the first dance were over, then I left the reception and went home. I have not spoken to her since.  


It's been about 4 years since her wedding, and I am now engaged and getting married in 2 months. I did not invite Maria or any of our old friend group. In my mind, our friendship is well and truly dead. Apparently, Maria ran into my sister at a store and were chatting and my sister mentioned the wedding. Maria texted me (honestly shocked she still has my number) to send me her address “so I knew where to send her invitation” and I just responded “thank you, but the guest list is already set. have a nice day”. She told the friend group and now they’re all blowing up my phone about inviting them ‘for old time’s sake’ and that I owe at least Maria an invitation because I was her MOH. They’ve been posting on social media and now even my mom is getting involved, saying I should invite them all just to keep the peace and out of respect for our old friendship.

  
My argument is that I haven’t spoken to them in years, and I don’t care about this ‘wedding etiquette’ thing and I don’t owe her an invitation just because I was her MOH, especially considering everything that happened with her wedding. But literally only my fiancé is on my side. So, AITA?

1bcgc6d,AITA For Giving My Wife The Cold Shoulder After She Donated Our Vacation Fund?,"I (41m) and my wife (39f) are people who like to travel. We take our kids (12f and 14f) on trips 2-3 times a year. And over the year I usually put aside money for travel. My wife's niece also needs knee surgery due to soccer injuries (soccer season ended a month or so ago) and my sister-in-law can't really afford it. I'm not sure how much health insurance will cover or how much the surgery will even cost, but they've been looking for help to pay for it. 

&#x200B;

Well after we booked flights and stuff, we had about 15k-20k left in the account. We didn't really know what to do with it yet.  

&#x200B;

FF to this morning, and my wife and I are talking about attractions and stuff and my wife kind of sneaks in to the conversation that we would have to pay out of pocket since she gave the remaining money to her sister. I was absolutely fucking livid because a) That was our money in the account, which means my money was also in the account and b) I'm SURE they don't need that much, especially if they have insurance which will most likely cover some of the surgery cost. 

&#x200B;

Since then, I went to work, came back, and haven't spoken to her since. She's tried to talk about it, but I don't want to talk about anything except my money getting back into my account. I feel bad for ignoring my wife and giving her shade but at the same time I'm really fucking pissed. AITA?

Her growls and snarls whenever I visit her and she brings it with her when she visits me. I have a cat which I keep locked away when the dog visits as I don't trust it.  She brings it everywhere with her. 

She has been talking about going on a cruise as her parents came back from one that went to the Bahamas. I found a good deal on one to the Carribean. I booked it and sent my girlfriend the details. She's super excited and mentioned that she was even more excited that the dog could come. I immediately told her that the dog was not coming as I was not going to put people at risk and have the vacation ruined. Her parents are more than happy to watch the dog when we go away, but she is trying to fight me on bringing the dog along. 

I then told her that if she continue to press the matter about bringing the dog, I would cancel the cruise. She got pissed at me and started sending me horrible messages and telling our mutual friends that I was trying to separate her from the dog. I haven't spoken to her all day as I need space and time to think. She clearly sees me as the AH and trying to paint me as the bad guy.

1b6pymg,AITA for throwing a piece of popcorn at someone who kept using their phone during a movie?,"The title is pretty self-explanatory... but here are the details...

We went to see Dune 2 (HIGHLY recommended) last night... in a VIP theatre with comfy seats and table service... which I mention because to attend, you must be 19+ -- they serve real drinks.

Seated two rows ahead of us, were three young women... 19-22 I'd guess.

They didn't shut up during any of the previews, and spoke loudly to each other throughout the movie... which is annoying, but, unfortunately, hardly unique these days.

But what was incredibly annoying... starting at about 20 minutes into the movie, one of them got onto her phone. She was only two rows ahead and it was full brightness, so it'd be an understatement to say it was distracting. She'd text, scroll instagram, watch TikTok videos... for a few minutes... then put it down. Ten minutes later, out came the phone again. 

After the third time, I said, quite loudly, ""Put the phone away!"" She looked back, gave me a look like ""STFU old man"", but put it down. And then, 10 minutes later, pulled it out again. Again, full brightness.

So I got a piece of popcorn and threw it at her... hit her on the head. As you can imagine, she turned around... ""Are you fuckin serious right now?!""

""Yeah, I'm serious, can't you live without your phone for a couple of hours?""

""Shhh!"", said someone

""Shut up!"", said someone else.

She put it away... and then, maybe 20 minutes later, out it came again.

I threw another piece of popcorn, which barely missed but flew by her face. She put the phone away and it stayed away for the rest of the movie.

Nobody stood, nobody clapped, nobody really cared. And that might have been the end of it, except after the movie, she quite bluntly said to her friend as we were walking out, looking at me, ""That's the asshole.""

In telling others about this this morning, I've come to understand that movie etiquette has changed from when I was 20. Back then, of course, there weren't phones... but it was unheard of to engage in behaviour that'd be distracting to others. And when phones appeared 30 years ago, you'd NEVER get on it during the movie, and if you had to, you'd walk out and deal with it. But these days, this is par for the course.

Anyway, if I'm paying $25 per ticket plus food plus drinks (expensive!) plus parking for a night out and a true theatre experience, I'd like to enjoy it with what I think is the environment all of that deserves. I can watch movies at home and get on my phone all I want, for free. This is supposed to be different.

Am I out of touch? AITA? Is this ok these days?

And maybe that behaviour is not OK, but AITA for throwing a couple of kernels of popcorn at someone?

1bezcnp,AITA for not giving my house to my SIL?,"Throw away for obvious reasons. This happened 2 nights ago, and I'm still feeling some type of way about it. 

Background: My (30f) husband (32m) has a younger sister (SIL 25f), SIL is currently going through a divorce with 4 children. My husband and I also have 4 children. My husband and I live on a very quiet country back road in our little town, us and his family being the only residences on the road. So both his sisters and their families, and his parents, live within walking distance of our house. 

My husband and I have been married for 7 years and have 4 young children. My husband bought the land we live on from his parents when he was 18, and when we got married, we built a house on it. We designed our house with a big family in mind and designed it to be our forever home. It has never been a thought to move or look elsewhere. 

My SIL is going through a divorce. She is struggling, to say the least. She was in a very toxic relationship with her ex, with her contributing just as much as he was, and he filed for divorce and moved out, leaving the 4 kids with her. 

My mother in law called my husband 2 nights ago and asked if we would come over for a chat. We get there, and my In-Laws and SIL are sitting on the couch like they were staging some kind of intervention, it was just really strange. 

My MIL didn't beat around the bush at all. She explained how SIL's ex was getting the house in the divorce and they would be homeless within the month if we didn't give her our home. It honestly took me a second to comprehend what she even said, because it was so out of left field.

Husband didn't need that second and looked them dead in the eyes and said ""No."" 

In-Laws started telling us things like, ""You guys don't need all that house"" ""You guys can move into one of the new neighborhoods in town"" ""You guys can just built a new house"". 

I offered to open up our playroom and guest bedroom to them until they could find somewhere to live, we have air mattresses and the guest room has a full bath, but that was not good enough apparently. That's when we got up and left. 

They began yelling after us, saying we don't care about the children, family helps family, we're being greedy and selfish, etc etc. I'm Honestly so proud of how we reacted, because my first instinct was to go off and say some hurtful things, but we went just home, to OUR home. 

We love SIL's kids, and obviously do not want them to be homeless, but they don't need MY house at the expense of my own children and family. I don't see why SIL's family deserves my home, what about my kids? 

Now the In-Laws are calling/texting, saying we don't care about the kids, we're selfish and greedy, we're making her homeless, and I'm wondering if maybe we were too quick to say no.

1b5v77r,AITA for suggesting my minimum wage and part time boyfriend pay me back for half of my gas for taking him to and from work everyday?,"My (27 F) boyfriend (36 M) of 8 years works at the Amazon distribution center and I am the one to give him rides to and from work, as he works overnights and I worked days. He does have a friend who takes him to work 1 time a week. I also take him to appointments when needed and to the gym daily. He does not have a car or license at this time due to several unpaid speeding and parking tickets.

So about 3 weeks ago I was laid off from my job in marketing. I was making about $55 an hour and holding things down at home with the mortgage and bills without any issues, so I never found it necessary to ask him for gas money to take him to work and home. I figure he works hard and doesn’t get paid much so why make things worse for him? I fill up my gas tank about one time a week for $60. I understand that he is making only $16 an hour and working only about 24 hours per week. I am also privileged to have gotten an masters degree, so I can see how charging him for gas may be an asshole move. But now that I am unemployed and living on much less from unemployment, I am on a budget. I feel like I’m making changes to my lifestyle such as letting go of my personal training sessions, going natural with my nails and avoiding overconsumption.

So on Thursday I asked him about paying to fill up my tank once every two weeks, and I’ll pay the other two weeks, and he got really upset and told me how much easier life has been for me and how I take that for granted. He also says he doesn’t have the money to pay $120 a month for gas (which is understandable because he only makes about $350 every week) even though I have been paying all the bills since we moved in together 4 years ago. I told him that I am not a free Uber service and I feel taken advantage of at times. He still has avoided talking to me about the matter. Am I the asshole in the situation?


TL;DR I lost my decent paying job and am on unemployment and am asking my minimum wage part time work boyfriend whom is unlicensed to pay for the gas I use to pick him up now due to finances. AITA?

She’s a sweet 14 year old shih tzu/poodle. She’s having joint issues, so when we take her on a city trip, we put her in a dog stroller so we can walk around. 

So we were navigating a busy sidewalk and this woman, her friend, and their kids, there were at least 4 kids—this woman points at our dog in the stroller and says “oh hell no.” She starts laughing, pulls her friend over, and they and their kids surround the stroller. The woman goes “are you for real? This is not a child. These are children.” Pointing at her kids. As if I was cosplaying a parent by having my dog in a stroller. I am child free by choice and parents like this are so rude. It’s like the world revolves around their kids, and how dare I put my old dog in a stroller. Strollers are for kids only! 

So I told her to F off and get out of my way and pushed the stroller forward to move on. She then starts yelling how dare i cuss in front of her kids. I kept walking and she left us alone, but it ruined my day and I can’t stop thinking about it. I think she’s an asshole, but was I wrong to “swear” in front of her kids? I was pissed off.

1bm6tz7,"AITA? On a Whim, My Husband and I Renewed Our Vows in Las Vegas Elopement Style. Divorcing Sister is Furious, Says We’re “Inconsiderate.”","I’ll try to keep this short (like my sister’s marriage 🙈). Background- My sister 39f) has been married for almost 2 years and in the process of getting an international, contentious divorce. It was a shotgun wedding and both families advised them against it (to no avail). We all saw this coming.

Anyway, last week was my daughter’s Spring Break and on a whim we decided to take a last minute trip to Las Vegas. I (42f) have been jokingly pushing a vow renewal on my husband (of 22 years) for a looooong time. We laugh about it and move on…usually. But right before we left it popped in my mind that doing a vow renewal elopement style would be fun (in the spirit with the last minute nature of our trip). I grabbed a white shirt, a light up plastic ring, a janky bouquet of faux roses, and a dress up tiara for our daughter (the flower girl). I found the absolute cheapest, cheesiest vow renewal package ($69 lol) and we went ahead and said “I still do!” after about a 3 minute ceremony.

It was just something fun for us and we didn’t tell anyone ahead of time or make an announcement of any kind afterward because it was *just fu*n. It was our 8-year-old who went around announcing to everyone (including people on the sidewalk…grocery store…at school) that her parents FINALLY got married. She doesn’t really realize (or care about) the difference between a wedding and a vow renewal so we got some side eye from people we know thinking we’d been lying all this time about being married. Fun times.

My daughter told her cousins and my sister that we got married on our trip. My sister was the Maid of Honor in our real wedding so, obviously, she got that it was a vow renewal. She didn’t say anything in front of the kids but gave me a super fake smile and laugh when she heard. When we had a moment with the kids out of ear shot, she let me have it. She told me it was completely hurtful and inconsiderate for my husband and I to do a vow renewal while she is in the middle of a divorce. Mind you, her divorce has been in the works for 6 months with no end in sight. She told me our vow renewal was “rubbing our marriage in her face” and said we should either have not done the vow renewal or kept it a secret. She hasn’t spoken to me since and this was almost a week ago.

My mom is a people pleaser and refuses to take a side on this one. My friends think my sister is nuts to be mad about it (but maybe they’re biased because they’re *m*y friends!?). And my husband stopped caring about what she thinks/says years ago. We are not close with my dad at all so me, my sister, and my mom are all the close (nuclear) family we have. I don’t want this to become an issue because it was mostly just silly joke decided on last minute. I’m thinking about apologizing to my sister for making her feel bad and just trying to move on. But part of me is refusing to do that because I think she’s being ridiculous. So, kind friends, please tell me, AITA!?

TLDR: my sister says my Las Vegas elopement style vow renewal was inconsiderate because she is going through a divorce.

The mother makes a face and says “well you smell awful. You could at least have the decency to go home and shower first.”

I didn’t expect a stranger to get nasty with me, and after a long day I didn’t have the grace for it, especially with over an hour of driving ahead of me. I also didn’t feel like explaining to the woman that I had about 1.5 hours of driving ahead, that I wasn’t going home first, and to take this little detour would’ve meant 50 minutes of driving (30 from work to home, 20 from home to pharmacy) instead of 15 (from work to pharmacy). So, I snapped back “well maybe you could have the decency to mind your own damn business!”

She chastised me for being rude and stormed away with her daughter saying she was going to tell the store I’m “mistreating her”. Nothing happened. Ten more minutes later and I had my meds, and now I’m here wondering if maybe I snapped a bit too hard.

1bgj5u2,AITA for not being over excited for a coworker coming out?,"AITA for not being over excited for a coworker coming out?  I (married/straight/M34) have worked with Toby (fake name M30) for about 2 years. We don’t hangout outside of work, but interact almost everyday and have always gotten along. One day Toby seemed “off” so I asked “Hey, are you ok? You seem off.” After a pause he looked at me seriously and said “I’m gay…” and then stared at me without saying anything else. I didn’t suspect he was gay, but I knew he didn’t ever talk about SO. I responded “Cool!  Is that a recent development?” And he said “Yes, I’ve only told my family.”  I responded, “That’s cool man! Do you still go by He/him/Toby?” Him “Yes.” Me “Ok, well thanks for feeling comfortable enough to tell me” and we went back to work. 

A few days go by and he had told a few other people. One of those people pulled me aside and told me I hurt Toby’s feelings when he told me first. Toby thought I was dismissive in how I responded and it soured his coming out experience. I’ve interacted with Toby a few times since then and it didn’t feel any different than before. 

I responded the way I did because I didn’t want to make a big deal about it. He’s being who he is and I thought making a big scene out of it would cheapen that. Plus, I have no role in his life outside of work. I don’t want to do anything to make work weird for him or me and I’m not sure if I should do/say something or just leave it alone.

1bjqegz,WIBTA if I tell my friend her son is not welcome to stay in my house unless he is responsible for himself?,"For context: My (F31) best friend (F31) is a single mom of a 14 year old boy. She has low contact with her parents because they kicked her out when she got pregnant in High School, so she doesn’t have  a big support system. We are really close and  I’ve always done what I could to help her, her son is my nephew, not in blood, but in every way that counts,   
  
She does everything for her son. I mean everything. He doesn’t even pick up his plate from the table after he finishes eating, she does it for him. While I personally don’t think this is a good way to raise a child, I never gave her my opinion, she never asked for it, it’s not my business how she decided to raise her child and I’m not a mom so how can I give parenting advice?  
  
Last week my friend  had to take a 2 business trip and had another one schedule for next week. She asked me if her son could stay at my house the days she is out of town, because she doesn’t feel comfortable leaving him alone in their house. I agreed and he stayed with me for 2 days last week.   
  
The 2 days were a frustrating experience for the both of us because he kept expecting me to do everything for him, including: packing his back for school, picking up his clothes whenever he dropped them, serving him cereal in the morning, washing his dishes, and waking him up in the morning to go to school. He even blamed me because he missed the school bus because I didn’t make sure he woke up after his alarm rang. I heard his alarm and assumed he was awake.   
  
I’m not eager to repeat this experience. I love that child but he is too old for this I think. BesidesI have  a demanding  job. I don't have time or energy to be the maid/babysitter of a teenage boy even if it’s just two days.   
  
I’m thinking about telling my friend that if she wants her son to stay with me next week he has to be responsible for  himself. I can promise to cook him 3 meals a day, and I can make sure he is up for school, but he needs to pick up his own clothes, pack his own bags, and wash his own dishes, Otherwise he cannot stay. I don’t feel this is unreasonable, but I feel kinda bad putting these conditions because she doesn’t have  a big support system, and if I don’t let him stay at my house it’ll be really hard for her to find somewhere else to drop him off.

1b51stz,"WIBTA if I move out, leaving my chronically ill roommate vulnerable?","I (30sf) live in Los Angeles, where rent is really high.  I live in a house with two roommates (30, 50f).

My 30-year-old roommate, Kay, has been battling an autoimmune chronic illness for a couple of years. She’s not able to eat a lot of foods and has these spells where her energy is drained. 

My 50-year-old roommate Tammy is emotionally immature, doesn’t help out with chores and has a tendency to be really forgetful. For example, she once broke a toilet seat and didn’t bother to replace it before going on a last-minute trip out of town. After I got the delayed utilities payment from her, it came with a poop emoji attached to it. 

I’m responsible for the major utility bills (water, power and internet). It’s hard getting payments from Kay and Tammy because of Kay’s health issues and Tammy’s irresponsibility. They also have two dogs who are very loud and cause a ruckus.

I’ve been having a hard time coping with Kay’s health problems.  It’s horrible for me to say it, but when she is down, she is down. That leaves the majority of household chores, bills, and trash on me.  

I’m in school and working full time.  I can’t stand living like this anymore. Recently, a friend of mine was looking to fill in a roommate vacancy. I will pay more for rent, but the location is closer to my college and my work. 

I feel guilty moving out because of Kay’s health issues. She relies on me to help her get groceries she’s sick. Not to mention, Tammy does f-all to help around the house.

Kay even said that if I move out, it will be bad for her because of her health problems. She says she’s trying to get better, but she’s been saying that for over a year and it’s affecting my life too.

1b50c4a,AITA for naming my child after a villain?,"So, I recently gave birth to my husband and I's first child, a girl. When I was pregnant, we had a lot of trouble deciding on a name, but I finally found one I liked and my husband said he was fine with.

My husband was playing Street Fighter and I watched for a few seconds, and the character Juri was on screen, and something just clicked. I really loved the sound of the name, and brought it up to my husband. He was a bit unsure at first since the character is apparently a psychopath (I don't really know anything about the game or character) but I assured him it'd be fine since we aren't literally naming the baby in honor of the character, and that since it's also a real name it's not like it's inherently tied to that. He ended up agreeing to go along with it, and said it was a nice name regardless.

So, months later, the baby's born, and I'm talking with a friend of mine. She ends up asking how we picked the name Juri, and I brought up that it was kind of a funny story and explained how we picked it. She was kind of astonished, saying that I was naming my character after a villain who's a ""psychopath"" and that I was setting my daughter up to be bullied. I argued that it's a real name, and that it's not like I was naming the kid something like Darth Vader where anyone who hears it will immediately associate it with a villainous character. My husband chimed in saying he went to high school with someone named after Melina from Mortal Kombat (who is also apparently a crazy villain character) and everyone just thought it was cool when they found out. The friend just said that I was setting my daughter up for a lot of hardship in the future, and now I'm second-guessing my choice. I didn't think it'd be a big deal but a few other people among my friends/family found out the origin of the name and are now telling me it was horrible to name my child that.

1br32ip,AITA for not removing my ‘inappropriate’ bathroom mat for when my mother came over?,"I (24M) recently got married and one of the homewarming gifts i received from my dad (45M) is a bath mat that says ‘GET NAKED’ on it. It’s hilarious and it’s proudly displayed in the bathroom. My wife finds it hilarious too because she appreciates the close relationship i have with my father.

As you can tell, my dad had me pretty young and we have a very close relationship. He bought me the house i share with my wife Bia (24F) and he is the coolest parent ever. We get eachother silly gifts all the time and it’s the way our relationship works. 

He raised me by himself until he met my stepmother (i call her mom but for the purpose of the post I’ll call her stepmother) when I was six. He was technically with my biological mother until I was four but she was neglectful and abusive hence why he did all the child care himself. I’ve been trying to rekindle the relationship with her since I was 14 but it’s gone bust multiple times. We’ve been consistently in contact for the past three years and we are slowly making improvements although there is a long way to go. 

At my wedding, we had a mother son dance alongside the father daughter dance and I danced with my stepmother instead of my biological mother. No one was shocked by this besides my biological mother. 

She was really hurt by this so I’ve begun to put a bit more effort into our relationship. I’m not going to hold her actions from 20 odd years ago against her anymore when she’s being apologetic and has done the work to improve herself. My stepmother is fiercely protective over me and even she admits my bio mother is making a lot of progress. 

My bio mother is also very religious and conservative. She came over to my house for the first time and saw the mat. I knew it may have been an issue with her but thought that she wouldn’t comment on it. She tried to tell me it was sinful and that i should remove it and when i told her it was from my dad, she said it was childish of him to give me something like that. Her main thing against my dad is to call him childish because he’s younger than her by 3 years (i think, not even sure how old she is tbh) and apparently the mat was another iteration of his inability to grow up. FYI, he is a successful doctor with five more children that are being raised perfectly, I can’t even call them demon younger siblings because they are angels. 

I told her that I was going to remove the mat just because she was at my house, she said it was inconsiderate, we argued and she left. 

My wife thinks that she was over reacting although my friends said i should’ve removed it because most older people aren’t as chill as my parents (dad and step mom) so i should’ve anticipated her reaction. She is mad at me now and thinks that i don’t care about rekindling our relationship. AITA?

1b6okh1,AITA for calling my sister out for telling my wife that she looked pregnant?,"My sister isn't a child, she's 30. The thing is that she hasn't had the most conventional adulthood.  She spent most of her late teens and early twenties in and out of one rehab or another, she didn't go to college, lives alone and I don't think she has that much of a social live. She lives out of town so we don't see her much.

My wife isn't a heavy person by any means,  but like many, many people, she isn't quite as thin as she was when we first married, pre child and all that. Totally normal and obviously I couldn't care less. My sister came over with my mom to visit several months ago which was her first time seeing my wife and I in years. She came into town again more recently and we met her at my parents house. She saw my wife and said ""oh I thought you were pregnant"". Implying that my wife looked pregnant last she saw her but clearly isn't as she would be showing more now. My wife is a very emotionally mature person and didn't make a thing of it and neither did I. 

I thought maybe my sister, perhaps being less exposed to societal norms than some, didn't know that you don't say that,  ever. So I sent her a text later on telling her that I know she didn't have bad intentions but that it's generally quite rude to comment that someone looks pregnant and really shouldn't be said, basically ever. 

She got all bent out of shape, saying I was a jerk for ""guilting"" her and that I should ""grow up"" and ""stop taking everything so seriously"".

1bsmeyn,AITA for telling my roommate's girlfriend that she needs to leave?,"I live in an on campus apartment with a roommate. I pay a reduced rent but I work for the school so I'm getting shit pay and still pay a decent amount of my paycheck for rent. Only me and my roommate are on our lease, however it's not uncommon for my roommate's girlfriend to stay with us for a while. As in multiple weeks at a time. So much that it's caused a noticeable increase in our power and water bill. It also causes a hassle when getting ready. She obviously takes super long in the shower and bathroom, uses all the hot water and leaves hair in the sink and shower which I refuse to clean. 

All of this has lead me to feel that she needs to go. I have a pretty busy schedule so I rarely see my roommate with enough freetime to tell him to kick her out, but I do see her pretty often. Yesterday, I got done at the gym and came home to shower before work and she was in the bathroom. I told her I needed to get ready for work and she said she wouldn't be too long. 

I ended up going back to the gym to shower and was late to work waiting on her. I get home and my roommate is now at work and she's in the living room. I tell her that she needs to get her own place to live. I said I cannot deal with another person here, she lives here for free and I don't want her her so she needs to get out by the morning. 

At around 11 I am woken up by my roommate yelling at me and calling me a bully for what I did and accused me of being jealous since I don't have a girlfriend. I told him that I wouldn't have said that if he made sure she wasn't imposing. He's still mad and she's still here so it's been awkward lately. He

1bm5c92,AITA for refusing to wear an awful bridesmaid dress to my sister's wedding?,"My (Jane, 25/F) sister Lisa (27/F) is planning her wedding. She's detail-oriented, has a preference about everything, and wants it all to look perfect. Part of her plan is for all six of her bridesmaids to wear the same dress in the same color, and we knew that going in to shop with her at a boutique. Unfortunately, the other five are much smaller than I am, so picking out a dress that fit us all became an issue.

&nbsp;

We all tried on her favorite dress at the end, and it took me a long time to get it on. Outside I could hear her squealing with happiness as everyone else walked out of their rooms, and saying things like ""This is the one!"" with her friends hyping it up. But not only is it a horrible pale color that makes me look sick, it's unflattering to the point where I have massive rolls in the back and look pregnant in the front, especially with shape wear, which just bulges everything out across my hips and pinches the fabric up the sides. I also can't move well in it, and can't raise my arms more than halfway.

&nbsp;

I tried to talk to Lisa about finding a similar dress that could work better for my body type, but she and the other bridesmaids insisted that this was the perfect color and dress. Lisa was dead set on everyone matching exactly and seemed locked in on it, so we ended up (quietly) arguing in the store in front of our mom and the sales associate who came to check on us. They tried to calm things down by saying the dress looked fine and everyone matched nicely, but it was pretty clear they were just trying to keep the peace. When I asked the sales associate, ""Does this dress looks fine *on me?*""  her face turned red and she started talking about how it was important to honor Lisa's wishes on her special day, and at that point I hurried up to change and left. 

&nbsp;

Since then, Lisa and I haven't talked, while both my parents insist that I need to suck it up and do what Lisa wants for her wedding, while also relaying that she's been really upset about this issue, but I have been as well.

1br0k7o,AITA for forcing my partner to see a musical with me?,"My partner (27m) is not a fan of musicals. He doesn't ""hate"" them so much as is just isn't something he would choose to do. My family and I (26f) love musicals and they were a big part of my childhood growing up.

We moved to London not that long ago, and as a going away present my Mum bought us tickets for the Back to the Future musical. This is a really nice gift since they aren't cheap.

I assumed by boyfriend would be fine to go with me, but now he is refusing, saying that he would rather just stay home, and he doesn't even like musicals anyway. He argues that I could just take someone else.

The issue is that I have not been in London long, and don't really have many friends here yet. I'm also quite a shy person, so asking someone I don't know that well to see a show with me is a bit anxiety inducing. Plus, it was something my Mum got for us to go and see together as I had told her previously that it was one of my partner's favourite movies.

I'm really annoyed at my partner for this, because the tickets have already been paid for, and I was hoping that even if he wasn't a huge musical fan he could suck it up for me. My options now are to either go by myself, not go at all, or force him to go with me (which he has complained bitterly about).

1bavc2o,AITA for asking a hotel employee how they knew my name?,"
I’m staying in a hotel in Dublin City for the weekend and have a late flight home tomorrow evening. Around an hour ago I went to reception to enquiry if they could keep my luggage safe after check out and before my flight. There were two men at reception I spoke to. One was the young male receptionist who checked me in yesterday. The other was an older man, (50s) but he was not wearing the hotel uniform. 

The receptionist said “yes that’ll be no problem” and I smiled and said “that’s wonderful” then the older man said “what time’s your flight weary fruits?” I said the time and then realised, he knew my name which surprised me so I added “oh, that’s funny, how did you know my name? I didn’t tell you…” now I honestly believe my tone was more curious and confused since it had caught me off guard. I honestly thought maybe I was wearing something with my name on it and even looked down to see! 

The receptionist, said “oh, I don’t think he called you by your name, maybe he said Madame?”, I say “oh really? My mistake!”, honestly relieved if not a little embarrassed but the older man chimed in “no, she’s right, I know your name weary fruits. It’s my job to know everything and everyone here”. I reply with a nervous laugh “oh that’s bit weird…” I expected he was going to say JK or that he’s the manager and prides himself on knowing names etc. I clock that it all seemed a bit weird since he didn’t try to make it obvious he was joking. My real name isn’t even close to Madame so I don’t think I misheard him.  

The older man then asks what room am I in. I was caught up on how he knew my name but wouldn’t say how he knew it, so I started to feel a bit worried. Out of instinct I asked “why do you want to know that… I’m confused”. I believe I said this timidly but with a bit of anxiety as I remember scanning both their faces as I said it.

The receptionist interjects and smiles as if to reassure me, “i think he just wants to offer you a late check out”. I feel a better so say something along the lines of “oh I see that’s very nice of you but I guess I’m still just a bit weirded out by the name thing. Sorry I have had a long day so…” The older man says “well, I was going to, but since you’re been such a b word - I won’t do that now”.

 This  caught me off guard. Out of instinct, I said “I’m sorry I think this is gone the wrong way but it just confused me that we’ve never met and you know my name”. He then double down and repeats a similar line about how he just wanted to be nice but I had to go and be a b word about it. He’s not smiling or laughing just for context.

I can tell from the receptionists face he is shocked. I took a breath, said slowly, calmly, “okay well, I think that’s it. I really don’t know what to do with “that” (I gesture widely in his direction) language. I don’t appreciate it and I don’t have anything else to say so….” I go to leave, they both call me back but I just raise my hand and say “no, I’m done” and I left the hotel for air.

1bex2yp,AITA for not supporting my wife in changing careers?,"Me (M29) and my wife (F28) have have 2 kids (4+2) and have been married for 4 years. My wife works part-time as a receptionist, while I'm a full-time plumber. When our 2 year old was born, he was very sick and as a result we have some medical debt.

We are not currently struggling, but are living just at the point where we are comfortable.

My wife hates her job, but keeps in it because she's good at it and it pays well enough for an entry level position. She has wanted to become a nurse for a long time, but was unable to attend college and with the kids it's fallen on the backline.

I'm sympathetic towards this, I really am and would love to see her follow her dreams and become a nurse, I've made that very clear. But, she wants to do it now, and honestly I don't really see how that is possible. Between the clinical placements, studying, paying for the course, working, our childcare situation, our debts, I cannot see how it would work.

My wife says she has spoken with her parents and the kids would be able to stay with them usually and she could get a nightfill job. But I don't feel like this is going to be enough, she will be earning a lot less and I will have to work more hours to make sure we are definitely financially alright. This will mean I spend less time at home, can't contribute as much to household chores, which she will have to pick up and balance even more work.

I said I can't support this choice and that she should wait a few years until the kids are in school and she has more time. She says I am an asshole, that she has a right to be happy in her life and I should be supporting her. She says its unfair that I get to enjoy my work (which I do) and she spends her days hating it.

I agree it isn't fair but I just don't feel like now is the time to go about this and can't support her choice to change careers.

1b993fj,AITA for telling my son that he should've told me about his girlfriend's dietary restrictions?,"My son (25M) started seeing a new girl named Lexi around a year and a half ago. She lives a few hours away, but they see each other often enough. I'd never met her personally until now. I don't know much about her, but she makes my son happy and seems to have a good head on her shoulders. That's all that matters to me. 

Last Friday, we hosted a barbecue and party, around 25-30 people. It was mostly family and friends. My son asked me if he could bring Lexi, and I told him that it was fine. We had ribs, burgers and wings, as well as some sides that didn't have meat.

What my son didn't communicate to me, or to anyone else handling the food, was that Lexi is a very particular eater and wouldn't be able to eat anything we served. Lexi is Catholic and can't eat meat on Fridays. My son was aware of this and invited her to a barbecue knowing what would be served. On top of that, she also has a sort of ED (ARFID) that limits what kinds of foods she will/can eat without feeling sick.

She was really sweet, and I enjoyed her company, but I felt terrible watching her sit without food. When I asked if she'd eaten beforehand, she told me that yes, and that she wasn't hungry. I asked my son separately why he'd gone out to eat right before a barbecue, and he told me that that they'd come straight from her house. So I asked him if she didn't like the food, to which he explained why she couldn't eat the meat, and that she wouldn't eat any of the sides either. Since he didn't say anything beforehand, I asked her myself.

I asked Lexi if there was anything I could get or make her, or if she wanted us to run somewhere and pick something up. She asked if I had any fruit, so she had fruit salad. After everything was sorted out my son came up to me and told me that I'd embarrassed her and shouldn't have drawn attention to it. I told him that he should have tried harder to accommodate her, or to at least tell us beforehand that she wouldn't be able to eat what everyone else was. We easily could have made some plain salad or had fruit available at no hassle for anyone else, and she would at least be able to pick at something instead of going hungry. If it were addressed beforehand then I wouldn't have had to ask. 

My son left in a huff to bring Lexi home, and he's still insisting that I made a bad impression and that it wouldn't have been a big deal if she didn't eat. Apparently I made her anxiety worse, but that's according to him, so I'm not sure I believe it. AITA? Could I have handled it any other way?",Just_Possibility_904,1729,0.9700000286102295,333,1709855036,2024-03-07 17:43:56,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1b993fj/aita_for_telling_my_son_that_he_shouldve_told_me/,3,2024
1bghnkw,AITA not asking permission to use hubby's coffee?,"My (28F) husband (37M) is a huge coffee geek. He has a separate set of shelves and equipment for it. I have tried over the years to learn more about his process and how to brew but it just doesn't click for me like it does for him. I always buy instant/go to Starbucks because it's all the same to me. He never says the coffee I've made is bad, just that something is always off. It's too bitter/astringent/weak etc. But thanks me anyway for my efforts.   
My husband is going through a busy time at work and has for the past 2 weeks. He freelances, his latest client turned out to be very difficult and he's had to make a lot of edits for this project. As a result, he's more stressed than usual and is working longer hours. So I thought that if I made him a coffee in the way he likes, that would cheer him up about it all.   
Long story short, he did not like what I brewed. He didn't really have anything nice to say about my gesture and then when he learned what beans I used, he was very annoyed and shut me out of his office without any thanks.   
He had two containers of beans on the shelf. I used the container which was small and finished it. I did not realise it was a rare coffee and processed in a unique way. It cost more than triple the other bag which was mainly full and double the size. I thought that using up the beans in the smaller container made more sense so he can buy himself another bag from his long list of beans he wants. He refuses to ever have more than 2 bags at once so he can appreciate them a lot more (whatever that means).  
He's upset with me because I didn't ask permission and he could have told me which bag to use if I was going to try and make him a coffee. I'm upset with him for his reaction. No thanks and shutting me out of his office. I think the whole permission thing is so gross to me and I shouldn't have to ask whether I can use something in our home.

1bez2tm,AITA for laughing at my sister because our mom won't let her share a room with her fiance?,"I posted here about a year ago because my mom and sisters thought I was an asshole because I went to Mexico with my boyfriend instead of appeasing her and making him sleep on the couch. 

My little sister thought I was wrong for not being able to spend nights away from him. Well we still are not married and my mom won't change her rules. We are visiting them though. And she accepts that we stay at a hotel. 

My sister Anna was one of the howler monkeys bugging me because ""I lied"" about not staying at a hotel last Christmas. She and her boyfriend got more serious since then and they got engaged on Valentine's Day. 

Last weekend was my dad's 60th birthday and we all came home. As per usual I rented a hotel. My mom told Anna that since my old room was available her fiance could stay there.

My sister tried arguing but my mom said there was no way that they were sharing a room. Anna tried to get me on her side since I no longer follow any dumb rules. I laughed at her and reminded her that she called me names for choosing to spend Christmas with my boyfriend's family instead of putting up with our mom. 

She started getting pissy and saying it was different because she was engaged and I am not. Our baby sister spoke up and said she already told Mom that she was going to follow my example if she ever gets serious with a guy. I'm pretty sure my mom thinks I'm the devil. 

Anyway Anna is pissed that I laughed at her for trying to get away with something she scolded me about just a year ago. I just thought it was funny she thought the rules didn't apply to her. 

Yes she is my mom's favorite. It didn't help.",No_Review8351,1672,1.0,1,1710457952,2024-03-14 18:12:32,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1bez2tm/aita_for_laughing_at_my_sister_because_our_mom/,3,2024
1blbacm,AITA for calling my mother homophobic for suggesting that my girlfriend ‘fixed me’?,"I (18M) was gay for as long as I can remember. I recently started dating my childhood best friend Lexi (17F). We have been friends since we were 10. 

I haven’t had feelings for a girl before so I’m not even sure what my sexuality is anymore. All I’m sure of is that I really like (possibly) love Lexi.

My parents have always been supportive of my sexuality but my mother has always seemed slightly disappointed. She never said anything about it outright, but you can from certain looks/comments that she made that she would’ve preferred it if i was straight. My father always told me not to pay it any attention because at the end of the day, she still loved me and needed time to adjust. He also said that she wanted life to be easy for me and that being gay made my life more complicated.

My mother loves Lexi and before I came out, she always made comments about it Lexi and I being together in the future. Even after I came out, she’d insist on me keeping my room door open when Lexi was over because ‘anything can happen if a boy and a girl are alone together, it’s natural!’. 

Anyway, Lexi was over at my house last weekend and my mother kept commenting on how we were ‘soulmates’ or about how we were such an adorable couple. After I got back from driving her home, my mother was grilling me about our relationship (how long I had liked her, how long we were dating etc). When I was finally released from the hot seat, she made a comment about how all I needed was the right girl. I asked her to elaborate and she said that my being gay was just phase and all I needed was for the right girl to come along.

I got pretty irritated after that and said she was being homophobic. We got into a massive argument. Now, my older sister thinks I was being an asshole because I know that my mother isn’t homophobic and that she’s from a different generation so things she’s saying are outdated, not homophobic. I feel bad now. AITA?

1bpgq11,AITA for not wanting to dump $15k on my sister's 50th birthday celebration? ,"AITA for not wanting to dump $15k on my sister's 50th birthday? 

So, I am doing fine in life financially but my sister is like on another level, way richer than me. She paid for her house x10 what I paid for mine, no exaggerating. She is very family oriented and enjoys family reunions, even when they end badly or hurting people's feelings. Both our parents passed away some years ago. So family reunions are the siblings getting together with their respective families. 

1.5 years ago she announced that she wanted to do something special for her birthday: she gave me notice, basically, that she wanted to have a family reunion at a posh European location for at least a week (she and her family are exploring Europe for 6 weeks prior to the actual party). I told her I was going to try to go. I did not have the courage to tell her that for me it would be difficult, just financially speaking. Bringing my whole family (I have many kids) on this trip was going to cost me no less than 15k. Just airfare alone would be close to 10k. 15k is one year of tuition (my oldest is a Junior) and I have other money stuff to think about too. So, when a thing from work created a conflict, I was relieved to have an excuse to cancel. 
She was super disappointed, particularly because she had made it very clear how important this trip was to her. If it had mattered to me, she said, I would have made the trip happen. So, I guess IATA. 
But, AITA for not wanting to shell out 1 year worth of tuition $ in a one-week ""special birthday celebration"" for my rich sister?

1blbtmp,AITA for being relieved when I found my friend was not adopting a child?,"Context: Randy (41M) and I (35M) have been friends since we took college courses together, same major and later finding out we lived in the same city but never met before. We've been through a lot as friends and have always had eachother's backs

After moving back to our hometown, we started a social group of about 15, then it grew and grew until we could fill an entire section of a bar and/or restaurant. Slowly but surely, people ended up not attending the outings as often when started having kids. Understandable. I loved our outings as I started drinking socially, never getting drunk. As far as I knew, Randy was also childfree and said when parenthood came ringing for them he'd say ""Another one bites the dust"" I'd reply ""Maybe we'll see them in five years""

Two months ago, I saw a post on Randy's facebook saying he was adopting a 1 and a half year old. It threw me for a loop because he'd never talked about wanting to be a Father or a burning desire. I was in a tailspin thinking ""Oh God, another one"" as my social circle has narrowed as they've had kids 

One month goes by and I see another post from Randy. He's a proud Dad

Of a dog. I was sooo relieved! I felt like I could howl at the moon because I wouldn't lose one of my favorite people to the parenthood Portal. 

Onto the conflict: At another one of our hangouts, Randy had shown his dog's picture to a bunch of oohs and ahhs and stories relating to their dogs' odd quirks. I said ""My heart lept when I realized he adopted a dog and not a kid, I was afraid I wasn't going to see him for at least five years"" We laughed, but Randy was a bit quiet. We finished our food and left. 

As we walked to our cars, Randy later told me I was a AH for being relieved he's a dog dad than a human dad and why was I so concerned about it? I told him that as I go on in life, it's hard to find non parents/childfree friends and I'm all for people doing what they want to do in life 

Randy asked why does that matter? I said I would've had to get used to a new reality with him as a Dad if he decided to have a kid and he knows exactly what that means. He's seen what happens with our parent friends we don't see unless it's at an event for their kid.  

Some of our mutuals are on my side saying I wasn't exactly wrong but I didn't have to say it like that. Others are on his side saying that I was wrong for saying I was relieved he was getting a dog rather than a child 

So AITA for being relieved my friend didn't adopt a child? ",Altruistic_Grass_428,1602,1.0,1,1711145780,2024-03-22 17:16:20,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1blbtmp/aita_for_being_relieved_when_i_found_my_friend/,3,2024
1b7kuhv,AITA for calling out a mom who was embarrassing a Hispanic woman over pronunciation?,"I (31F) was doing a friend a favor picking up her son at a day care run by a woman from Guatemala. At pick-up, I saw a woman in her late forties causing a scene about how the woman was “disrespecting” her four-year-old daughter by pronouncing her name as “Tee-ah” instead of “Thea” (her name). She was loud and calling the woman gross for not being able to get her daughter’s name right in front of both kids and parents.

I am not sure if I should have just minded my business but I said that the “th” sound does not exist in every language and that it is wrong to embarrass someone like that because of an accent. That definitely put an end to the scene as the woman ran off. Later my friend called to say that I caused a “problem” for her among the other moms at the daycare.

1bmwmu8,WIBTA For not abiding by the bride’s rules?,"WIBTA? I (36) female, am attending one of my best friend’s weddings in a few weeks in Mexico. She lives in Ohio, her family live in New York, and I live in Europe. She’s chosen Mexico for her wedding as it’s less expensive for her, and she thinks it can be a nice vacation for everyone attending. 

I was out of work for a few months this year and am actively trying to save to buy a house. Money is tight and going to the wedding is costing me thousands of dollars. I’ve made my peace with that and am genuinely looking forward to the wedding and the vacation. 

Today, the bride told me that she’s picked a very specific theme for the bachelorette party - one that would require me to buy something new or borrow something. I’m struggling to spend more money on this wedding so buying something, even second hand, is off the table. Borrowing something is tricky because I’m not the same size as any of my friends and I worry I couldn’t replace something if I ruined it. 

So, WIBTA if I just wore something I felt comfortable in for the bachelorette party?

Extra info. She picked a specific dress for the bridesmaids for the actual wedding which she paid 30% of and I paid the rest. It’s also not something I feel comfortable in (as it shows a lot of skin) but for the wedding it’s her day.
