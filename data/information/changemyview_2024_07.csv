1efax2p,"CMV: Polyamorous is not an orientation, it is a choice ","Monogamy is a relationship structure where two people choose romantic and sexual exclusivity with each other even when (*not if*) they are attracted to others. Monogamous people continually *choose* their person. It's not a magical state of being where attractions to others cease. You hear a lot of people who *choose to practice* polyamory say they have ""always been capable of loving more than one person"" as if they don't realize *everyone* is capable of this.

Monogamy is an agreement between two people. So is polyamory. They are relationship structures. Some people may be incapable of doing poly because of their desires or insecurities, but they are very much capable of cheating. They *choose* not to.

1e8tr61,CMV: Trump is too old to be elected President,"A major issue we saw unfold over the past few weeks is the public coming to terms with the very difficult and complicated reality that the President's age was beginning to impact his ability to be reelected given the doubts that he was too old to remain President. 

Now that we've all seen the risks of electing people who are of the age when these serious physical and mental barriers to effectively leading the country, I believe Trump is now under the microscope to prove that he's not too old, and I don't think he'll be able to survive that scrutiny. Generally, uncommitted voters have been deeply displeased by the fact that the last 8 years and the current election cycle have been dominated by presidential leaders/ candidates who were born in the 1940s. 

To change my view, I would need to see evidence that uncommitted voters are unlikely to be persuaded to vote for a younger, more vigorous, candidate who is more connected to the realities of the modern technological world we live in.",makemefeelbrandnew,3052,0.8100000023841858,1038,1721588496,2024-07-21 14:01:36,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8tr61/cmv_trump_is_too_old_to_be_elected_president/,7,2024
1ebsfmk,CMV: Its totally valid for queer people to feel uncomfortable flying Palestine flags alongside Pride flags or at Pride events.,"I think its totally valid and fair for a queer person to feel uncomfortable with the idea of flying a Pride flag alongside the Palestinian flag at events or rallys. As such they shouldn't be shamed or anything for voicing this. I think this for the following reasons:

1. It is well known Palestinians by and large are anti LGBT, as such its totally fine to feel uncomfortable promoting such a group at whats meant to be a pride event. After all, said group is against you.

2. It's fine to not want to be associated with another movement you don't fully agree with. Some supporters of Palestine go fairly extreme with outrigt supporting Hamas or spreading outright antisemitism. Its fair for anyone to not want their flag flying alongside another flag they may disagree with itself, or disagree with elements of.

3. It's fine to want pride marches and events to actually focus on Pride. Attaching other social causes to all of them just kinda dilutes the message and energy. Its totally fine for someone to prefer focusing on Pride Flags and the Pride community first and foremost; and thus wanting to avoid the inclusion of other flags.",The_Naked_Buddhist,2683,0.75,2259,1721906626,2024-07-25 06:23:46,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ebsfmk/cmv_its_totally_valid_for_queer_people_to_feel/,7,2024
1e43g5t,"CMV: If Donald Trump wins in 2024, his administration will take every measure available and necessary to ensure that Democrats never have a fair shot at winning a presidential election again. ","Apart from Trump and co. outright saying as much, apart from the championing of Jan 6th rioters, apart from his hundreds of ties to Heritage Foundation officials, apart from the vengeance he's looking to inflict on those who wronged him - it would still be painfully and abundantly clear to anyone with a pulse and a smidgen of intuition that Donald Trump taking the White House is end game for the hopes and prospects of Democrats. 

With Thomas and Alito conveniently deciding to step down during this period, the Supreme Court can act as Trump's vessel to achieve anything he wants. Their recent ruling already establishes as much. Four years is too much time to establish a stranglehold on democracy that will have its grips on this nation until we've torn ourselves apart from the inside out.

How did we get to this point; when the “best” picks are an almost-literally decaying old man, and the man who actually tried to coup the government (do not come at me with your bullshit justifications, trumpers.  Trump led an insurrection on the capital.  This is an objective fact, and you are just fucking wrong if you disagree.). The 2024 election is ridiculous, and shameful to American history.  I’m at the point, where I think America is just done; nothing will ever change.  We are doomed to keep doing this overly-dramatized, two-sided caricature of a constitutional republic forever.

1ea5wjp,"CMV: Sexism plays no role in referring to Vice President Harris as ""Kamala"".","First off, I am someone who recognizes that internal bosses are real and often play a role in micro-aggressions against women and minorities. Referring to VP Harris as ""Kamala"" is not one of those situations. 

1. Almost all of her merch says Kamala. Clearly that's how she wants to be referenced.

2. BERNIE Sanders, Nancy PELOSI, Elizabeth WARREN, Mayor PETE, LEBRON James, Nikki HALEY, AOC, FDR, Katie PORTER. It goes both ways for both genders. They just go by whichever name is more unique in America (or on Buttigieg's case, what is more easily pronounceable).

In my opinion, sexism plays zero role in people referring to her as Kamala instead of Harris.

1dykazg,"CMV: It is completely reasonable for Europeans to be concerned about the influx of migrants from Islamic countries, given the laws and culture of these countries and the beliefs of many of their citizens","I live in the United States, so I'm no stranger to fights over border security. But while I understand concerns about the number of people entering the country and whether we have the resources and economy to give them what they need and also provide for our citizens, I've never understood the concern about the people entering. Mexico and the US are very similar in terms of values and attitudes, so while there may be a language barrier it's not as though illegal immigrants coming in from South America and Mexico are going to try to impose their own vastly different set of laws or rules on others or even believe that should happen. 

But when I look at Europe and the migrants entering Europe, that's completely different. Islam does have its own rules and laws and many citizens of these countries believe that these rules and laws were created by God and therefore they automatically transcend any legal system created by mere mortals. 

I'm not saying most Muslims feel this way. Islam has many different sects, with different views. But if even a small % of the migrants coming in- an unknown number I might add- believe that they have the right to impose their way of life on others because it's the word of their God, I completely understand why people would be concerned. 

I'm posting this CMV because I figure that if so many people feel a different way there could very well be something I'm missing or not understanding about this issue. And since I'm on the left where most issues are concerned, I'd rather side with the left on this one as well.

1eem5bf,CMV: Voting should be mandatory and America should adopt the Australian voting model,"My view is thus, America should duplicate the Australian model for voting, which includes the following points.

- Election Day should be a federal holiday or moved to a Saturday.

- Failing to cast a ballot, even a blank ballot should result in a fine. This fine can be gotten out of with demonstrating a good reason you could not vote.

- Employers should be required to give anyone working on Election Day a reasonable amount of time off to vote. 

- Optional, but a part of the system that we should copy, even if not mandated by regulation or law. Fundraisers selling sausages at polling places, colloquial called “democracy sausages” a beloved part of the Australian voting culture.

It seems almost criminal to me that it’s not the norm for everyone in the world’s “bastion of democracy” to vote, and that it’s considered a point of concern to query and possibly fine everyone who didn’t cast a ballot.

My central view is that voting should be mandatory, the exact method by which we do this is not important to me, I was merely offering the Australian model as an option. I welcome being convinced why mandatory voting is a bad thing.

1dx9e4e,CMV: It is wrong to refuse service to Israeli tourists solely due to their nationality.,"There was a video uploaded to r/PublicFreakout and various other subreddits purportedly showing a restaurant in Vietnam having a confrontation with an Israeli tourist. While I agree his behaviour in the video and the context behind it paints him as being a bad-faith actor, I was somewhat and disturbed by the sentiment shown in the comments.

A lot of people in Israel are against the continuation of the war. In fact, there have been constant protests against Netanyahu and his government for prioritising it over other means of freeing the hostages. It should go without saying that not all citizens supp kj
Itbzl
G  ort the actions of their government. This is true everywhere, whether in Russia, China, or any other dictatorship like Iran or Saudi Arabia. Many of which commit even worse human right abuses and are rightfully condemned. Would it be right to discriminate against a tourist from such a country? No, and even if they are in support of their government tons of tourists with objectionable views are served regularly without any problems.

If the tourist was the aggressor and had incited the confrontation it would be right to refuse service to him. But the comments heavily plied that it would be correct to refuse service to all Israelis. I cannot see this as anything other than discrimination based on nationality. It might not be racist as nationality aren’t races, but it would certainly be wrong. And when criticizing someone for their (geo)political beliefs, one should not extend their criticism to all members of a nationality or religion. “Fuck Israel” is often heard due to the actions of Netanyahu’s government, but “Fuck Gaza” is never said even though the comparably vile Hamas is in control of Gaza. To me both would be too blunt.

For example there is hardly a tennis player, who would exchange a major title for an Olympic medal. A lot of the best players typically skip the Olympics anyway. During the 4-year period, there are 20 tournaments in tennis, which are bigger than the Olympics.

Or take football. Would someone exchange an Olympic gold for a Euro cup or a Champions League title? I find that very difficult to believe. Olympics is seen as some sort of glorified friendlies.

I think that inclusion of these sports devalues the status of the Olympic medal and it is really unnecessary as there are more then enough opportunities for the respective athletes to shine outside of the games.

1dt030v,CMV: There's no way to punish being homeless without perpetuating a cycle of poverty that causes homelessness.,"I've been talking with a lot of friends and community members about the subject of homelessness in my area, and have heard arguments about coming down harder on homeless encampments - especially since [the recent Supreme Court ruling on the subject](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/28/nx-s1-4992010/supreme-court-homeless-punish-sleeping-encampments). And despite the entirely separate humanitarian argument to be made, I've been stuck on the thought of: **does punishing homeless people even DO anything?**

I recognize the standard, evidence-supported Criminal Justice theory that tying fines or jail time to a crime is effective at deterring people from committing that crime - either by the threat of punishment alone, or by prescribing a behavioral adjustment associated with a particular act. However, for vulnerable populations with little or nothing left to lose, I question whether that theory still holds up.

* Impose a fine, and you'll have a hard time collecting. Even if you're successful, you're reducing a homeless person's savings that could be used for getting out of the economic conditions that make criminal acts more likely.

* Tear down their encampment, and they'll simply relocate elsewhere, probably with less than 100% of the resources they initially had, and to an area that's more out of the way, and with access to fewer public resources.

* Jail them, and it not only kicks the can down the road (in a very expensive way), but it makes things more challenging for them to eventually find employment.

1e11r9e,cmv: islam is the most political and furthest away religion from universal truth,"i think that all religions offer fragments of truth, that when pieced together eclectically and viewed figuratively, with an open mind can answer questions like where do we come from, why we're here etc. i know that all religions can serve political agendas but i feel like islam was specifically designed for that and it seems to be the furthest away from the same universal truth that each other religion tried to convey in its way, according to its historical and societal context.

islam positions itself as a correction to all these previous religions and harbors a historical and doctrinal insistence on its absolute truth and finality, which results in a heightened display of agression, defensiveness and self entitlement among many muslims. 

this manifests in a resistance to criticism and further insistence on the primacy of islam even when its principles clash with modern values or other people's beliefs (i noted that many muslims are not respectful towards other people's beliefs, and if they are it tends to be a feigned respect) 

in contrast, i feel like other religions tend to follow the same developmental trajectory and have a certain complementarity to them that allows for flexible interpretation. but islam's distinct approach resists such integration aiming instead to establish its supremacy.

this intrinsic defensiveness leads to intra-community conflicts, and muslims tend to monitor each other's behavior as well (im thinking of the 100 monkeys experiment) which brings me to my next point which is that islam incorporates values that can be seen as mechanisms of control. like the strong emphasis on obedience to parents (which we know can be harmful), the punitive measures for apostasy and blasphemy and the authority of religious leaders and scholars (literally every king of a muslim monarchy claims descendance from the prophet even when it doesn't make sense from an ethnical pov, im from a country like that and i can assure you that it works in maintaining the status quo) and their interpretations are accepted without question, stifling critical thinking and personal interpretation. 

i feel like islam encourages adherence through fear and hate. like i as a child, at school or at home i would get told a lot of scary stories to justify what should and shouldn't be done, and i always lived in anxiety bc i interpreted stuff literally, that was probably due to my autism. but i digress. 

anyways change my view.

One noteworthy fact about this poll was that she was the only person who beat Trump out of everyone they inquired about (Biden, Kamala, Gavin, etc.) 

https://www.thedailybeast.com/as-dems-cast-the-search-light-looking-for-biden-alternatives-michelle-obama-trounces-trump-in-reuters-poll

Michelle Obama (obviously) carries the Obama name, and Barack is still a relatively popular president, especially compared to either Trump or Biden. 

Betting site polymarket gives Michelle a 5% chance to be the Democratic nominee, and a 4% chance to win the presidency, meaning betting markets likewise believe that she likely won't be president only because she doesn't want to run, not because she couldn't win. Even Ben Shapiro has said she should run and is the democrats best chance to win. 

My cmv is as follows- if Michelle Obama decided to run, and Biden endorsed her, she would have very strong (probably around 80%) odds of winning, as per betting markets. You can add on that I believe that no one else has higher odds of winning than she does.

Black slavery was part of the culture of the time, and it was not right, and I think we can all agree on that. This is something that silently bothers me so I would like to hear the other side to see if I can understand it. If it's religious I could understand it, even when I'm not religious myself, because from a religious person's perspective, it is the indisputable word of God and cannot be doubted.

The argument I see the most often is that some women choose to wear the hijab, I'm obviously not talking about these cases, please refrain from bringing this up. 

I find the idea that women should cover themselves in restrictive clothing in order to ""protect themselves from lewd gazes and abuse"" ridiculous and kinda like victim blaming, why is the victim forced to forfeit her liberties instead of the abuser learning to not...abuse. And yeah I understand the Quran is also sexist with men, but then again, it doesnt make it right.

1dw7szc,CMV: Imprisoning CEOs of companies that hire illegal immigrants would effectively end most illegal immigration. The fact that any policy like this hasn't been proposed is proof that neither American party wants to actually address the issue. ,"Here is how you end illegal immigration in the US. 

You don't build walls. You don't increase border security funding. 

You curb people's desire to come here. 

Why do they come here? Despite being illegal, thousands upon thousands of American businesses hire illegal labor and pay them cash under the table. 


ICE could be converted into a Labor Auditing department (we may already have one but since it's obviously not effective, I'll refer to making a new one) that is funded effectively and whose goal is to audit all business employees to make sure they are legal. Not only will NEW-ICE conduct audits, they can conduct undercover operations on large organizations to find out if they are hiring illegals. 

If a business is found to be employing illegal labor, the hiring managers and CEOs could face 2-3 years in prison. This will encourage business leadership to heavily audit themselves and ensure that when NEW-ICE comes investigating, their books are clean. 

It wouldn't address the illegals that already live here. But when these people can't find work anymore, word will spread and they will stop wasting their time crossing into a country where businesses are too scared of imprisonment to hire them.

Thats my proposal. 

Here's the thing, I don't want you to CMV on why that proposal is a bad idea. 

I know it's a bad idea. It's a great solution for solving the issue Trump brought up after every question during the debate. (migrants flooding in). 

People truly don't understand how ingrained illegal labor is in our society. Do you know how much of the food you get from grocery stores has been handled and processed by illegal labor? It's one of the reasons prices are so low. 

People would freak out if produce prices doubled over even tripled because companies have to pay higher wages to American or legal work visa owners to harvest their produce. 

Both parties know that actually fixing illegal immigration would be a disaster for their reelection chances. As we've seen, rising food prices, gas prices, and inflation are most people's top priority politically. 

Is it right that companies exploit cheap labor? No. But since when has the American voter cared about morals? In our individualistic society, we care far more about our bottom lines than ethics and working conditions for non Americans. 

Nobody wants to fix illegal immigrants coming in because we need them to sustain our 1st world lifestyles. 

And yet, we fight over it and catasrophize it because most people are dumb, uneducated, and do not understand the complexities around it. 

Which is why you shouldn't vote for either party based on their border policies. Look at other policies they propose because they are straight up lying to you about the nature of immigration in this country.

1e5u7gm,CMV: Trumps' intended economic policies will be hugely inflationary.,"A common refrain on the right is that Trump is some sort of inflation hawk, and that he is uniquely equipped to fix Biden's apparent mismanagement of the economy.

The salient parts of his policy plan ([Agenda47 ](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/reclaiming-americas-independence-by-slashing-bidens-disastrous-trade-deficits)and public comments he's made) are:

* implementation of some kind of universal tariff (10%?)
* implementation of selectively more aggressive tariffs on Chinese goods (to \~60% in some cases?)
* targeted reduction in trade with China specifically
* a [broader desire](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-vance-us-dollar.html) to weaken the U.S. dollar to support U.S. exports
* a [mass program](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/trump-immigration-republicans-explained.html) of deportation
* at least maintaining individual tax cuts

Whether or not any of these things are important or necessary per se, all of them are inflationary:

* A universal tariff is effectively a 10% tax on imported goods. Whether or not those tariffs will be a boon do domestic industry isn't clear.
* Targeted Chinese tariffs are equally a tax, and eliminating trade with them means getting our stuff from somewhere else - almost certainly at a higher rate.
* His desire for a weaker dollar is just an attitudinal embracing of higher-than-normal inflation. As the article says, it isn't clear what his plans are - all we know is he wants a weak dollar. His posturing at independent agencies like the Fed might be a clue, but that's purely speculative.
* Mass deportation means loss of low-cost labor.
* Personal tax cuts are modestly inflationary.

All of the *together* seems to me to be a prescription for pretty significant inflation. Again - whether or not any of these policy actions are independently important or expedient for reasons that aren't (or are) economic, that is an effect they will have.",blancpainsimp69,747,0.7599999904632568,426,1721252433,2024-07-17 16:40:33,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5u7gm/cmv_trumps_intended_economic_policies_will_be/,7,2024

1duq261,CMV: Christianity’s decline in the west is largely owed to the fact that a vast amount of Christians are virtue signalers who use their “faith” to excuse being bad people.,"I would like to start by saying that I know the title may seem incendiary, but I honestly couldn’t think of a better way to word my position.

I also think it’s important that I used the phrase “in the west” because Christianity is still growing in areas of the world such as Africa and Asia.

Also, I should preface this by saying that my argument cannot be proven by facts. Calling someone a bad person is obviously a matter of opinion, but I feel as though throughout my lifetime I have seen this phenomenon more and more. One fact I can point out is that Christianity is declining in the US, and i believe it is because of the people who falsely believe they are the “good Christians.” Don’t get me wrong, I 100% believe that anybody should be allowed to practice Christianity if they want to, and nobody is inherently bad just because they are a Christian. In fact, I would still say that if I all I knew about a person was that they were Christian, it would be my immediate assumption that they are a good person, as that is the kind of life the Bible teaches that one should lead. I also believe this transcends any one denomination, although what I’m discussing is definitely more common in more radical denominations such as Baptists.

I’ll be honest, this is an argument that is founded primarily on personal experience. But there are still plenty of examples of this occurring in the public eye. Conservative figures like Nick Fuentes and televangelists like Kenneth Copeland lead, in my opinion, extremely unchristian-like lives yet still use their faith as a shield in many cases. Also, a staggering number of churches have been exposed as being parts of human trafficking rings in the last 10 years. I don’t want to seem like I’m generalizing all christians; I am merely bringing up examples to show how this phenomena is a large contributor to the decline of public trust in Christianity. 

I know that sin is expected of humans, but it seems like some of the largest sinners want to let the whole world know they are Christians and hide behind their faith to excuse their bad actions more than the Christians who keep to themselves.

I’m sure many of you know people in your personal lives that fit into this criteria as well. I think that the growing number of Christians-in-name-only are, to their own obliviousness, causing the decline of Christianity. It makes people lose trust in the organization, because, like with many other discourse groups in America today, the loudest members tend to disproportionately represent the group as a whole. Actions speak louder than words, and just because a person gets up early on Sunday to sacrifice an hour or two out of their day does not by default make them more virtuous or moral than someone who doesn’t. I fear that this post is starting to sound more like a rant than a civil viewpoint, so I will leave it at this.

If Joe Biden were to pass away, Vice President Harris would immediately replace him right now. If Joe Biden were to pass away 10 seconds after the election was certified, the Vice President, who at this point, Joe Biden has intended to be Kamala Harris, would replace him. If Joe Biden were not the incumbent, and Kamala Harris was not already the Vice Presidential candidate, there would be an argument because there would be no clear line of succession, but there is in this case.

Unfortunately these migrants oftentimes do not respect the local culture and commit crime at all much higher rate than their native European counterparts.

They also tend to come to Europe with little to no marketable skill so they stay relatively poor, form their own enclaves, displacing the native French, Spanish, Italian communities and replace them with dangerous ghettos.  Since they are often stuck in these poor ghettos they do not assimilate to the local cultures even from one generation to the next meaning that all the problems the first generation brought will only be passed down to the second generation.

This only exacerbates the issue which even right now is a complete crisis.

Black is the more prominent of the members.  A few days ago, during a ""make a wish"" segment at a concert, Gass said his wish was something to the effect of ""that the shooter doesn't miss next time"".

Black went on to cancel the rest of the tour, also stating that future creative plans are now on hold.  Gass issued an apology - not a ""sorry if you were offended"" type, but an outright ""what I said was wrong"" kind.  He knew what he said was inexcusable.  

I do not understand peoples' reaction to this.

*""Oh, so now they're holding satirical comedians to a higher standard that political candidates!""*  Huh?  Who's ""they""?  Black is an outspoken liberal, so he's never been supportive of Trump and similar people.  He's holding his bandmate to the same standards he's held others to, including politicians.  

*""This must be that cancel culture that Republicans 'don't believe in'!""*  Again, huh?  Jack Black himself is the one who pulled the plug.  The promoter didn't cancel the tour.  The venues weren't canceling shows.  The leader of the freaking band made the decision.  

*""What a way to treat your friend.""*  Still confused here.  Ever since 2016, people on my side of the political spectrum (left-leaning) have been quite vocal about the notion that you can, and should, disavow your own freaking family if they say outrageously toxic things.

But I think a lot of people have just jumped on the bandwagon and started yelling about it without ever knowing what they really are standing for. 

Most people chanting ""From the river to the sea"" or other phrases like this do not even know the meaning of what they are saying. Not to mention that these statements are usually inflammatory coming out of these people's mouths. People scream these at protests but refuse to acknowledge any other point of view as having a sliver of validity, because a different opinion just equals wrong here. All this does is create more hate between the two sides when both sides can't talk about it without being accused of any number of hateful words. If on average more people were tolerant of people with different views on this subject, and tried to educate, the divide in countries beside Israel/Palestine wouldn't be nearly so bad.

Most people on both sides also don't hope for the possibility of a cease-fire. They want the eradication of a state, one way or another. This has become a war of hate, both in those countries and in others.

Furthermore, the age demographic I am referring to has completely forgotten about the Russo-Ukrainian war.

That’s just family right? We learn to live with it. But when Trump’s permanently-grumpy running mate called childless women “cat ladies” , I thought: this type of behaviour needs to stop.

However, in my personal observation, many more people are less happy than when they were childless. And many more people regret having children than not having children.

So a lot of people, especially my age, are realizing that beyond economic limitations, we just aren’t interested in having children because we’d be less happy if we did. I, for one, would much rather be hiking or biking on my own than changing diapers or watching little league games.

And I don’t see anything wrong with doing what maximizes my happiness if it doesn’t harm anyone else.

1e8hzgg,CMV: You CAN be racist to white people,"Why is there such an insane double standard when it comes to white people and non-white people on the subject on racism?

Why is a black or asian or latino, etc. person able to call a white person a racial slur without anyone batting an eye? But when a white person does the same, it's suddenly not ok? Why is that?

A racial slur is a derogatory term used against members of a culture, nationality or ethnicity. The N-word is a derogatory term used against black people. Cracker is a derogatory term used against white people.

Why is it ok to use one, but not the other? Why because of the colour of my skin is it ok for someone to say haneous things to me and make me suffer through it without being able to call it out because ""you can't be racist to white people"" or some other unjust reason?

Racism is discrimination against members of a culture, nationality or ethnicity. If you discriminate against any culture, nationality or ethnicity then you are racist. It doesn't matter what country, ethnicity or community you belong to, it is racist to discriminate based on those factors. You can be racist to anyone.

One argument I have heard many times is that white people can't experience racism because they ""systemically oppress"" other ethnic groups. Ok. Here's a hypothetical:

Let's say that tomorrow we are all transported back to the time where we were cavemen. No society, not system, no government. Nothing.

If a white person calls an Asian person a slur, is that racist? Yes it is because that falls under the definition of discrimination.

If an Asian person calls a white person a slur, is that racist? Yes it is because that also falls under the definition of discrimination. There is no ""systemic oppression"" excuse now. It's the stone age. No society, nothing like that. Just basic human emotions and conflicts.

It is racist to call a white person a slur the same way it is racist to call a black, Asian, Latino, etc. person a slur. And yet white people are forced to endure being called these things and not being able to call out the unfair and unjust treatment we are subject to.

I am so sick and tired of seeing the media pushing this false narrative that it's ok to hate white people. But if a white person said it's ok to hate any other race, they would be harassed to no end.

But that still doesn't detract from the fact that the vast majority of them were, indeed, trying to overthrow the government. They may have been as incompetent as the Wet Bandits, but I think we can all agree that the Wet Bandits' bumblingness didn't make them any less guilty of their crimes when they ultimately got caught at the end of the movie. 

Whereas apologists look at the footage of insurrectionists wandering aimlessly around the lobby like tourists and see them just being a wee bit disorderly, what I see is them running around like chickens with their heads cut off, trying to find something to do in furtherance of their goals. They were likely all thinking to themselves ""ok ... I'm inside the Capitol, so ... umm ... what do I do now?!"" Their end goal was still the overthrow of the government; they just didn't have a solid plan on how to make that happen. Again, that doesn't make them ""not insurrectionists."" That just makes them bumbling idiots. Big difference. 

Then, we have Trump himself. Yes, I'm aware the Supreme Court just declared he's above the law. But as far as my vote this November is concerned, I don't give a shit. The man stood back and allowed the rioters to do their thing for HOURS before finally enough pressure was put on him to send in the troops to stop it. 

And yes, I'm aware that he was never indicted for that part. No immunity necessary, he just never technically committed a crime when he failed to send in the troops immediately. DeShaney v. Winnebago County clearly says that ""failure to enforce"" isn't a crime in and of itself. 

But again, as far as my vote this November is concerned, I'd like you to take one guess as to exactly how many fucks I give about that legal technicality. 

Trump insisted that it was Antifa, not his boys, who were actually the ones doing the right. First of all, I don't give a shit, and second, even if that were true, that only gives Trump LESS excuse, not more, for why he didn't send in the troops immediately. If they weren't his boys, then what was his incentive to let them do their thing?!

So no, Trump can 100% kiss my ass. Change my view!",acerthorn3,467,0.6600000262260437,1228,1720017437,2024-07-03 09:37:17,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dufxg2/cmv_the_jan_6_riotinsurrection_at_the_us_capitol/,7,2024

I think the odds of my view changing are low, but I’d sleep better if I genuinely thought a different form of government could possibly work well for most people.   

My baseline belief is that democracy, as a broad-based feedback mechanism, helps drive social and economic prosperity over time because it holds the powerful decision makers accountable to the needs of the many.

1duoxb4,CMV: The Lancet and Andrew Wakefield should be legally culpable for their MMR-autism paper ,"Former British medical doctor Andrew Wakefield, along with a dozen other researchers, published an infamous paper claiming a correlation between the MMR vaccine, colitis, and autism in 1998. It was published in the prestigious journal *The Lancet*. The study consisted of a dozen children, with only eight of them endorsing intestinal distress and developmental disorders. Wakefield used it to conclude it could have an effect on the pathology of ASD and questioned use of the combined MMR vaccine. What wasn't disclosed was the lack of informed consent by parents, the literal selection bias, Wakefield's recruitment by lawyers wanting to sue vaccine manufacturers, and Wakefield's profiteering off the research through a single vaccine patent he held and test kits for a fabricated disorder Wakefield claimed he discovered. 

All of this survived peer review, community scrutiny, and media sensationalism. It was not the medical-scientific community that led to Wakefield's demise, it was an investigative reporter who unveiled what did. As a result of the things I listed coming to light, Wakefield was stripped of his medical license and barred from practicing medicine, and only *after* this did the Lancet retract his paper and repudiate him. Of course, The Lancet itself is not innocent either, as they criticized the medical panel that investigated Wakefield and proclaimed he followed proper peer review and medical ethics guidelines. 

Given the damage this scandal caused to public trust in vaccines, science, and the reputation of peer review as a gold standard, I feel Wakefield losing his medical license isn't enough. I think both Wakefield and The Lancet should be open to litigation for any and all harms standing can be established for. I also believe that The Lancet should be rejected by the research community as prestigious. No, The Lancet isn't the only old medical journal to be marred by articles that aged poorly. But fee of those caused the same level of damage this controversy did. 

Hell, Wakefield is still out there enjoying a modicum of public support. And The Lancet is still prestigious, despite the fact it stood behind the article until after Wakefield lost his ability to practice medicine. Neither party is innocent, and both deserve to be buried in bankruptcy.

1. Leadership: husbands are expected to (gently) domineer day-to-day life. As the head of household (according to traditional gender roles), a husband should have the final say in all matters, and every tradwife I’ve seen on social media is more than willing relinquish control and acquiesce to a strong husband’s will.

2. Protection: husbands are expected to handle all threats to tradwives/family units, be it physical, emotional, or financial. Tradwives want a “fixer” - a man who will face all problems head on, shielding them from hardship in all forms.

3. Aesthetics: from what I’ve seen (willing to change my mind here), tradwives want a conventionally “masculine” man who looks the part. A man who LOOKS like they could handle points 1 and 2. Tall, big hands, muscular frame etc.

I know that dom/sub relationships don’t necessarily conform to traditional gender roles. But from what I’ve seen on social media, tradwives just want a burly, strong man to protect them from external danger/obligations/responsibilities. Change my view!

I understand that the staff wants to go home, but I always found it weird that there is an unofficial window where it's wrong to ask for service even when the business is open.

Restaurants should list two times: one time for when the last order will be taken, and one time for when the restaurant fully closes.

During that window, it should be expected that the staff can clean the kitchen and unused tables in any way that they can while the remaining customers eat. The window should be large enough for a large party to receive their food and have a reasonable amount of time to eat. Once they are past the cutoff, they cannot order anything other than more water.

After closing, their tables and anything else gets cleaned. Hopefully the head start would make that process easier on the staff.

1eg8y7e,CMV: A woman that exploits a mans loneliness for money is just as bad as a man that exploits a girl that's struggling financially. ,"I just watched a YouTube video about a grown man that killed his entire family and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Webcam Models. The ""pay to play"" women that will talk to you and give you a show for money. Obviously she did not force this man to do what he did, but this guy clearly had issues, and she failed to use adequate judgement. She is an average looking women, nothing special about her, and yet some random guy from across the world is spending thousands and obsessed with her? She had to know he was not right in the head, nobody is that oblivious. But this case alone is not the reason for my opinion. This is happening all over the place online, you go to dating apps, men looking for companionship, you have escorts on there, scammers, women trying to exploit men in any way they can to come up financially, and it's often the lonely or unattractive men that are targeted. 

  
I believe this is just as bad if not worst than a wealthy man exploiting a woman who needs help financially. Women give you a set amount of time, and then you're out. At least in the case of a man exploiting a woman she gets a place to stay, resources, etc.. Not saying it's a vacation, but she is getting something to help her in life.

1edgou8,CMV: Helicopter Parenting needs to die,"I recently saw a stat that 20-25 percent of Gen Zers have brought their parents to a job interview. If true, I don't understand how any parent could possibly think involvement to that level within an adult child could possibly help them land a job. Honestly, you're just doing your child a disservice as we all have to eventually learn how to survive on our own. Kids also need to learn how to fail as that is a learning opportunity as well.

To clarify, I'm not talking about 17-year olds getting their first job, but their first after-college ""real job"".

I'm a Millennial and I encountered some of this in college as well. I was always flabbergasted that parents of students would bug professors about their kid's grade or call campus safety to bitch about their kid's dorm room being too cold or too hot. I told my parents that this was happening at the time and they were both mortified. They wouldn't have interfered to this level and I wouldn't have wanted them to.

The goal of raising kids is to create humans that can stand on their own without this sort of ""help"" from mommy and daddy. I'm totally understanding when it comes to letting adult children live with you - the housing market sucks and rent is astronomically expensive (but that's a whole other issue). However, the type of parental involvement is a serious problem in my view.

1e5e06p,CMV: Standard sheet music is an unintuitive mess that has killed countless people's interest in learning music.,"As some background, I've been making music as a hobbyist for over 20 years in DAWs (mostly FL Studio).  A few weeks ago I began learning piano.  The instrument itself is wonderful.  I love the way it sounds.  I love that you can play chords with one hand and melodies with the other.  Practicing scales is fun.  Practicing chords is fun.

Learning to read sheet music is.... A total nightmare.  You shouldn't have to decipher the Rosetta Stone to figure out which note you're supposed to play, but this is what sheet music asks you to do.  Sheet music doesn't reflect the actual physical layout of a piano whatsoever.  They've decided to map the C Major scale (a 2-2-1-2-2-2-1 pattern) onto a series of alternating (1-1-1-1-1) lines and spaces, which is a totally baffling decision that leads to all sorts of insane notation difficulties.  We need to go through a ridiculous process to figure out what note a symbol on the staff is representing.  Is it a treble clef or a bass clef? OK, bass clef, so now I have to say All Cats Eat Grass... Oh wait, my mnemonic device doesn't extend three lines below the staff where this note is, so now I actually have to count the notes as I move down.  Oh wait, the key signature has four sharps, which is... checks Google... E Major.  Which means this note needs to be sharp.... It can legitimately take over a minute just to figure out what one single note is.  And that's not even getting into the ridiculous way that rhythm is notated, with measures of differing physical widths and all sorts of weird symbols to denote things that would've been obvious if you had just placed them on an equally spaced grid.

I genuinely think this miserable, arcane system has caused many otherwise potentially talented musicians to just give up.  And before you go saying ""Well they couldn't have been great musicians if they couldn't learn sheet music"", I heartily disagree.  Nothing about learning sheet music has anything to do with actual music... It's a terrible exercise in rote memorization and deciphering somebody's ridiculous secret code.

As for alternatives, I've tried reading two other systems that seem to be just completely superior to sheet music in every way.  The first is the hooktheory website.  Now this is a sensible way to notate music.  It gives you the key of the song (I don't need to memorize that four sharps means E Major).  The songs are notated in a piano-roll like format, where the notes are color-coded according to their position in the scale and note names are shown on the left side.  The chords are numbered and named below the melody, and also color coded.  Accidentals are shown on the lines between notes and color coded with stripes of the note above and below.

But even better than that is Klavarskribo.  This is a notation that just lays out the piano on the page.  White notes are shown as white.  Black notes are shown as black.  Measures are equally spaced out and you can just look at the spacing to know when to play things.  I legitimately was able to just start playing songs of any key, spanning all over the piano, no problem whatsoever, in Klavarskribo notation because it's just an intuitive format that matches the piano perfectly.  Weeks of sheet music study, 2 minutes of Klavarskribo study and I'm already better in the latter.  That speaks volumes.

So yeah, sheet music is a mess and there are better alternatives.  I think it's important because again, people are being pushed away from learning music by this awful system.  Things that won't change my view:

* ""I learned it! Many people have learned it! Therefore it's fine!"" No, just because you learned it doesn't mean it's a sensible system or that it hasn't turned many others away from music.  

* ""Well it's everywhere now so you'll just have to get used to it!"" Yeah I know, that's why I'm still learning it.  Doesn't mean it's not an unintuitive mess.  And it doesn't mean we shouldn't try to incorporate other alternatives, especially for beginners to learn.

The one argument I've heard that might make sense is the compactness of sheet music.  But I haven't actually seen any data showing how much more compact it is (or even if it is at all) than other systems.",KimonoThief,406,0.7699999809265137,290,1721208935,2024-07-17 04:35:35,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5e06p/cmv_standard_sheet_music_is_an_unintuitive_mess/,7,2024
1duo62a,CMV: The idea that any and all government action is inherently a bad thing is toxic to political discourse and only enables authoritarianism,"It’s commonly said in America that “government is the problem” and many people across the political spectrum believe any or almost any government action is bad or wrong by default. Politicians run on cutting regulations, without specifying which ones they’re talking about. They run cutting taxes, without specifying what tax rates they actually want. They run on states rights but don’t specify what rights they’re talking about.

This means that any sort of dialogue about these policies can easily be shut down. How are you supposed to have a discussion on if a particular regulation is helpful or not when you enter into it with the assumption that all regulations are bad? How do we have a discussion on how a federal state should be structured if the default response is that the federal government is always bad? We can’t, because there’s nothing to discuss, we’ve left the realm of practical politics so evidence doesn’t matter. I could provide you with all the evidence in the world that a law will save money, improve the lives of every citizen, and be a more efficient way of running things but that won’t change your mind if you think laws are inherently bad.

Furthermore, this rhetoric makes it easy for politicians to be corrupt because no one cares as long as regulations are being cut. Who cares that those regulations were only in industries the politicians buddies have companies in, or that a law was stopping bribery from happening, it’s cutting tape so it’s fine! And then when surprise surprise these policies make public services worse and the government more corrupt, the politician can turn around and blame the government in general rather than their own policies. Nothing is ever their fault and so nothing will ever be done to fix their mistakes. It also means that important bureaucracy meant to check government power can be cut as well under the guise of “removing red tape” but all that does is make the government more authoritarian with more power.

This sort of rhetoric also gives people the perception that the government as an institution is separate from them and has a will of its own when this is not the case. Governments do what the people running them want them to do, and in the US those people are elected by us. We decide how the government functions even in this corrupt age. The government is a tool, whether it’s helpful or harmful depends entirely on how those in power use it.

I’m totally fine with having a conversation about what powers should belong to the federal vs state governments or how directly democratic institutions should be or the role of the government in society. But our complex modern world cannot function without some amount of government action and pursuing some libertarian utopia that will never happen is silly and stops you from thinking critically about policy. No one thinks any and all government action is good because that would be stupid, and the opposite belief is just as silly yet millions believe it.",LineOfInquiry,401,0.8199999928474426,219,1720037986,2024-07-03 15:19:46,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1duo62a/cmv_the_idea_that_any_and_all_government_action/,7,2024
1egy8na,CMV: Packing the US Supreme court is a bad strategy in the long run.,"With its rulings over the last couple years, many people (Myself included) no longer believe the Supreme court is impartial or apolitical as it was intended to be, and that it's been internally compromised by corruption and partisanship. Supreme court reform is Obviously needed, and one common suggestion on how to do that is to pack the court. The concept is quite simple, with a larger court, a small biased minority will have a harder time influencing rulings, among other benefits.

There are issues with this however, the first being why and how the packing would begin. The most common suggestion for expanding the court is for Biden or Harris once she steps up (Assuming she wins) expanding the court to 13 justices, one for each circuit. The implication of course being that all five of the new judges would be young and liberal. This will cause issues down the line however, since republicans will be watching closely. The republicans will likely win at least one of the next 3-4 presidential elections, and when they do they'll be nothing to stop them from packing the court again, say to 17. Then Dems win again, and bump it up to 21. You see where this leads, the court will start ballooning, and justices will be blatantly political. With so many positions opening up, prospective justices may start all but campaigning  for them, hoping to be selected by party leadership on either side. If the packing doesn't stop then within decades the court will be a bloated, partisan, ineffective office where any pretense of them still ""interpereting the constitution"" will be long gone, as the SC becomes a third legislative chamber.",Working-Salary4855,400,0.7300000190734863,474,1722459515,2024-07-31 15:58:35,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1egy8na/cmv_packing_the_us_supreme_court_is_a_bad/,7,2024
1e12cl5,Cmv: Trumps visit to North Korea is overlooked to the point where it helps him gain support,"I don't like Trump at all but I can't deny that his visit to North Korea was a massive foreign policy win that has been criminally understated by the media and political crowd as a whole.

I see this as a similar act to JFK visiting the Berlin wall, or Nixon visiting China. I think it combines some aspects of both these events. Similarly to JFK visiting Berlin, it accomplished little on paper but had a substantial impact worldwide on a social and propaganda level. Many would argue that JFK's visit started/helped along the path to the fall of the Soviet Union and the US winning the cold war. Granted that didn't happen for another 30 years, but I don't think the goal of the North Korea visit was to immediately dissolve the state at that point either. It's similar to Nixons visit as it was a first for any president to enter north korea, and arguably the first real effort from both sides to talk things out. 

I think this also negates what a lot of Trumps critics said, especially before the election, which is that while he might be an experienced businessman, he would be useless at foreign policy. Not only did he set some groundwork for future negotiations with North Korea, Russia didn't try to pull anything during his term, and he didn't have any military blunders, unlike the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Furthermore South Korea largely applauded this action, which speaks volumes. And in researching some more about this topic, I read that some North Korean top brass might look down on Kim if he doesn't play ball with the US after these talks, which might have been part of Trump's plan all along. 

Quid pro quo deals are much more likely to be effective than what other presidents have done, by simply denouncing North Korea at every conceivable opportunity. It worked pretty well with the Soviet Union, and is a great compromise between doing nothing and a military invasion.

I think these lead into my second point, that the medias refusal to acknowledge some of Trump's genuine accomplishments simply feed the fire for people who want another excuse to support him. Now whether that would actually sway people one way or another is a debate in itself, but there is an undeniable double standard. 

The only arguments I see against my point is that 1. Trump has done a lot of bad that outweighs the good. I won't argue that point here, but I think my statement about the double standard from the media isn't helping. 

The other argument many have made is that Trump was the first to in some way legitimize the DPRK. I disagree, if that is the case then JFK and Nixon legitimized the USSR and China respectively too. The fact is that the DPRK does exist and as I stated above, the quid pro quo approach will be the most effective in the coming decades.

1e5v5gg,"CMV: Even if a fetus were considered a fully-fledged human, abortion should still be permitted for the mother without limitations according to United States law. ","To start: I am not looking for moral appeals here. “It kills the baby” “it’s wrong” “it’s mean” “you shouldn’t have gotten pregnant” are not arguments against my position. I am arguing within the legal theory of the United States, not within a moral framework for this argument. 

Assumptions: I grant for the sake of argument that an unborn fetus is a human being with all rights that should be accorded to natural born citizen. 

As an aside, in an extreme view of this position I would hold that once viability has been reached, the fetus should be eligible as a tax dependent, a co-rider for carpool lanes, and should have a social security number, etc. Please note that personally I do not feel that this is true, but for the sake of a stronger argument, I am allowing the pro-life side a stronger starting position: ie; granting the fetus full-personhood. 

Argument: The fetus is a human being who cannot survive without a birth. This human will die if they do not leave the womb through a medical procedure: ie, birth. 

This surgery is unique in that it requires a medical intervention on the body of the patient benefitting from the surgery (the fetus being born) but it also requires to consent and cooperation of a third party to be involved in and accept the dangers of the surgery: the mother who is giving birth. The fetus cannot be born, and thus cannot live, without being born by the mother, full-stop. The mother, on the other hand, can continue to live quite easily without going through the dangerous medical intervention that is childbirth. Her life is not endangered by the requirement to give birth, only that she is forced into a binary of doing something about the pregnancy, but abortion is significantly safer than a birth or Caesarean section, and in a purely pragmatic sense is the better option for her own health and wellbeing (assuming she does not want a child)

When taking this into account, the closest analogue I can think of would be a sickly sibling in need of a kidney. You are their only match. Without the kidney, your sibling will die, without question. And also without question, donating your kidney is dangerous, and poses a risk to yourself personally. 
But, while it may be morally wrong, or distasteful to not want to put yourself through the danger of that surgery to save your sibling, it is NOT MURDER TO NOT DONATE YOUR KIDNEY, EVEN IF THEY WILL DEFINITELY DIE WITHOUT IT. You choosing not to undergo a dangerous medical procedure that is unnecessary to your own personal medical wellbeing is not murder, even if that has the direct consequence of the death of another. It would insanity to force you to donate your kidney to a match, in the same way it should be insane to force a woman to give birth to a human. 

In fact, even if you had recently died, if you aren’t an organ donor, your rights to bodily autonomy, even as a corpse, trump your siblings need to violate your bodily autonomy in order to keep living. 

Even if all that was needed to save the person’s life was a single drop of your blood, you cannot be compelled to give it if I don’t want to. 

So why, when the rights of living, breathing, tax-paying, spouse-having, kidney-needing adult humans cannot supersede your abilities to make your own personal decisions regarding which medical procedures to engage in, should a fetus, even with the full rights of men, be able to do so?",cudakid210,369,0.6899999976158142,566,1721254769,2024-07-17 17:19:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5v5gg/cmv_even_if_a_fetus_were_considered_a/,7,2024
1dz8vxy,CMV: The idea that our building of skyscrapers has anything to do with subconscious preference of phallic shapes is ludicrous.,"Twice I've come across writings that propose a connection. 
First, I find that obvious incentives create skyscrapers: Building sideways is more expensive since you need to buy more land, and building vertically means you use more space. Building down doesn't happen because people prefer natural lighting.
Secondly, I find the link super esoteric. The patriarchy is a thing, but we don't subconsciously build penis shapes to honour it. Also plenty of skyscrapers don't look like dicks.
