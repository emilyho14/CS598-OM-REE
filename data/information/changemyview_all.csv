15ez7ul,"CMV: Ghosting is a real asshole move and ""no one is owed an explanation"" is a cop out excuse normalizing cruelness","Let's be clear. If you had a convo or two over a dating app, or even one to two face to face dates. Fine whatever, it's somewhat expected that ghosting happens. I still think you should say ""Honestly I'd rather not talk anymore"" block but I can see maybe giving that a pass.

But someone, whether it be someone you are seeing romantically, a friend, a family member does deserve some closure. If you just cease contact with no explanation that is an extremely fucked up thing to do. You are leaving people in limbo. There could be a period of days where they are questioning if you are just mad, busy or perhaps hurt. It takes a whole 5 seconds to type ""I don't want to be in your life anymore"" and if they say something mean or start to argue, block them.

What pisses me off is the super individualized, pop psychology excuses people use to defend this dogshit behavior. ""I don't owe anyone my time. No one is entitled to a response. Telling someone I want to cease contact may be unsafe. I have anxiety around confrontation, how dare you question me abliest!"" It's all such bullshit and you dancing around the fact that you are selfish, careless asshole for doing this. As for the safety thing, a person that is aggressive and unhinged actually may go more nuts if you ghost them then if you just sternly end things. And if they may be dangerous? End things over text and then block. What are they going to do? I know I'd be more pissed than if someone just ended things.

We should be striving to be more loving and caring people. Especially in this digital age where relationships are becoming more commodified. We are all sad, lonely, and a lot of us are inside more than out. Thinking you struck a connection with someone only to have that ripped away without an explanation is extremely cruel. I don't care if they aren't ""entitled"" to it.

One more thing I would like to add is some clarification on what ghosting is. I have heard people defend it in the past by saying ""I have had talks with this person and tried to establish boundaries. But they wouldn't listen."" That's not my definition of ghosting. To me ghosting is when one party suddenly ceases all contact when all was well the last time they talked. The ghostee had NO IDEA that the ghoster wanted to end things. It comes completely out of left field. Giving up on trying to talk to someone who you've repeatedly warned does not fit the definition IMO. If I am wrong there, let me know. But that is my understanding.

But yeah, ghosting makes you a cruel, selfish POS.",TheMedsPeds,329,0.8600000143051147,158,1690855626,2023-07-31 21:07:06,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15ez7ul/cmv_ghosting_is_a_real_asshole_move_and_no_one_is/,8,2023

What I cannot stand are neopronouns like xe/xem/xyr, ze/hir/hirs, and ey/em/eir. You can't just make up all of these little words and expect people to remember and use them. I get that some people are non-binary, and that's fine by me! But I feel like using they/them is sufficient because it indicates that you don't feel like a male or a female, and it's still an actual English word.

A) RFK Jr already acts like a republican in almost very way except for his official affiliation.

15gdyf8,CMV: No amount of mass shootings is going to persuade gun supporters to give up their guns.,"Every time there is a mass shooting in the United States, the attitude of many gun opponents seems to be one of bated breath: *""Surely* ***this*** *one will be The One - the one that will finally mark a watershed moment and convince gun supporters that enough is enough, and that it's time to give up guns.""*

......and it doesn't happen.

If there were to be a critical-mass moment, it would have happened by now. The sheer volume of awful mass shootings - Columbine, Parkland, Sandy Hook, Pulse, Vegas, Uvalde, Aurora, El Paso, Sutherland Springs, Virginia Tech, etc. - would have done it by this point. And yet most gun supporters are no nearer to abandoning their stance than before. Gun opponents are waiting for a ""straw that breaks the camel's back"" moment that may never come.

Granted, it's hard to see what argument *would* work to persuade gun supporters to give up guns - if any such argument even exists. But it can be clearly seen, from the last 20 years, that ""hoping that the next mass shooting will finally be the one that changes their mind"" isn't it.  

And when America gets its next mass shooting that kills dozens of people - which, for all we know, might come as soon as next week or something like that - the argument of most gun supporters will most likely be the same again: ""2nd Amendment, my guns didn't cause the shooting, the self-defense benefits of guns outweigh the drawbacks of mass shootings, we need guns to resist governmental tyranny, the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" etc.

(I agree that it's necessary for people who like it cold to tolerate some discomfort if maintaining their preferred temperature is unaffordable.) People who feel that a room is too cold can dress in as many layers as they require to be comfortable, but people who feel too warm have much less ability to mitigate their discomfort. This is especially true of spaces like schools and offices where a dress code requires more than just minimal clothing.

Using Christianity as an example, if a Christian is a homphobic, racist person who likes to beat their children and drive on the sidewalk, you don't get to say they're not a ""true Christian."" They are just as Christian as you are.

A humble, accepting, loving moderate Catholic is absolutely a part of the same group as a Neo-Evangelist who uses their platform to disenfranchise minorities and spread hate and fear. They both fall under the banner of Christian, and the denominations therein make no difference when discussing how Christian they are.

15j96fq,CMV: Humanity has not been visited by “non-human intelligence”,"David Grusch recently testified before the US congress that the United States is in possession of air/spacecraft operated by non-human intelligence. He has also mentioned in an interview that the United States is in possession of bodies of pilots flying these craft and they were non-human in origin. He goes on to elaborate that they have had these craft and bodies for decades and have even involved other foreign entities, specifically the Vatican, who have helped them recover these craft.

I think this is ridiculous. It would require a multi-national effort with airtight secrecy lasting decades. It would require multiple nations and government officials to stay silent on this topic and have no photographic evidence or other objective evidence of these craft fall into public hands. 

The non-human intelligence would need to constantly operate in a covert manner and avoid large populations of humanity to avoid having indisputable proof of their existence documented. Despite multiple private and public entities attempting to search for intelligent life on other planets, the only entities who have supposedly found proof of intelligent life are shadowy classified government entities.

15kmtfo,CMV: I see nothing wrong with legalized euthanasia,"hat's it. My view is simple. However, to expand why I think so. I think if someone wants to die, they have a fatal condition or they hate life. Now, I know some things are temporary, and that it can be fixed. So I propose that government give them one year of therapy etc. If they still want to die they should be allowed to. 

My second reason is, if the government has failed them, then the least the government can do is not punish the helper and them for taking matters into their own hands. Morally speaking, for example, if there was a town for whatever reason, think wild west, with no sherrif or the sheriff is literally sitting on his/her ass all day, I have no problem morally if everyone went all 'batman'. 

My third reason is, and probably the most important one, freedom and consent. If it's proven that there was no coercision etc. then the doctor or whoever shouldn't be arrested. 

Thats why I believe it's better to legalize it. There would be institutions to make sure that 

Now for background. I'm in canada. We already have checks in place for fatal conditions, I see nothing wrong with expanding it. 

But really the heart of the matter is, I don't see why the government should have a say what I do with my body. I am of the principle if it doesn't remove someone elses freedoms or rights, then it should be ok. I took nothing from my neighbour by dying. Breaking in and entering takes away their right to safety.

15momit,CMV: Conservatives have very little to lose if liberals win. Liberals have everything to lose if conservatives win.,"On most issues, the liberal stands to lose a lot, while the conservative stands to lose little or nothing.

Take abortion, for instance. If liberals win, it doesn't mean pregnant conservative women will be forced to get abortions against their will. Conservative life goes on unaffected. If conservatives win, on the other hand, it means pregnant liberal women will be denied abortions (if they want them.)

Gay marriage - if liberals win, no heterosexual conservative is going to be forced to marry someone of the same gender against their will. Conservative life goes on unaffected. On the other hand, if conservatives win, gay/lesbian liberals would be prevented from being able to marry.

Taxes - sure, liberals may raise taxes if they win, but it would be for *everyone*. Liberals are not going to pass some tax that only hits conservatives but spares liberals. There are plenty of rich liberals who would be hit hard by higher taxes if taxes were raised. 

Climate change - what do conservatives have to lose from a liberal world in which there are less carbon emissions and less air pollution? That's a *beneficial* thing.

Now, there are a few I could see conservatives losing substantially on:

Guns - this is one issue the political right might be affected somewhat; liberals might try to enact very strict gun control. That being said, plenty of liberals own guns, so they'd be affected as well.

Affirmative action: This could lead to fewer conservatives getting hired or admitted to elite colleges while more liberals get in.

The funny thing, though, is that based off of the *behavior* of conservatives and liberals, you'd never be able to tell that it was liberals who had the most to lose. Conservatives are the ones who fanatically support Trump, were so desperate that they tried a Jan-6 insurrection, while liberals are comparatively more placid, lazy and lackadaisical despite having much more to lose.

The military has a right to disqualify certain medical conditions for service. Whether that be a history of medical disorders or physical limitations.

Here are a list of conditions ive seen ppl have a problem with;

Diabetes mellitus (either type), a history of gestational diabetes, a history of gout, high cholesterol or TAG, history of anemia even if known to be caused by nutritional deficiency, history of kidney stones that reoccur, irregular menstrual, history of irregular PAP smears, PCOS, being intersex, being menopausal, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, history of more than one knee dislocation, history of stress fracture, excema/psoriasis/dermatitis that requires systemic steroid therapy or covers more than 10% of the body, severe acne, history of allergies that cause anaphylaxis, severe allergy to shellfish, peanuts, or treenuts, severe allergy to biting or stinging insects, restless leg syndrome, if you've had sleepwalking or night-terrors after the age of 13, Tourette's syndrome, if you have a history of headaches after having experienced a concussion, migraines, cluster headaches, ADHD if you've needed any accommodations (educational or work) after the age of 14 or you have taken medication for it within the past 2 years or have any other comorbid mental disorder or it's ever been documented to adversely impact your work or education, dyslexia, autism, depression if you ever needed more than 12 months of counseling or had symptoms or treatment in the last 3 years, any history of eating disorders even if in recovery, any history of suicidality, and any history of self-injury are all disqualifying, among many others.

And so on.

I have these believes because at times the military can lead people into austere deprived places around the world. Many medical resources wouldn't be there to treat underlying/ prior conditions.

If jo bob has a history of suicidal attempts when he becomes depressed ( deployments can be very sad places) he trys to hurt himself or others. He know is a person who cannot function in a immanent hostile area that is now taking up space and exhausting resources for those other warfighters.

15nrxil,CMV: Peak Privilege is Having Almost No Anxiety,"Those who grow up in households where most of their financial and social (and psychological) needs were met, and whose family has learned to enjoy such privileged life, will clearly have little to no anxiety. It seems obvious but I think there's more to it. Ever seen videos of someone doing an adventurous feat and commenters writing ""white people shit"". Yeah, it's because white people enjoy financial and social privilege in the US, they thus have little financial and social anxiety, and are more likely to be adventurous bc of it. Number one trait to know whether someone comes from an upper or lower class background? It's their anxiety. Some of my lower income tenants are extremely anxious for even the slightest inconvenience. Upper income people enjoy the luxury of not having learned anxiety in its harmful form while growing up. They do stuff, get injured if need be, and move on.  


  
And the social component is as equally important as the financial. The privilege of not getting anxious if a girl you are flirting with talks back? Of having social/romantic privilege, and knowing that you can get your social/romantic/sexual fantasies satisfied (even if not totally fulfilled). Think Chuck Bass in Gossip Girl.

To answer the two most common arguments to this:

Argument 1: What about the biological differences between male and female humans?

Answer 1: Although I do not deny the biological differences, the Selective Service System currently only drafts able-bodied male Americans who pass the physical strength requirements. If female Americans were also drafted, the same process would apply so no one who is not physically capable will be drafted. Therefore, the biological differences won't create an unfair draft.

Argument 2: No one should be required to register.

Answer 2: I completely agree except America’s leaders agree that despite the success of the All-Volunteer Force, registration with Selective Service must continue as a key component of national security strategy.

15qa9uf,CMV: Nobody is too Busy to not Text Back Within a Couple of Days,"This is moreso related to dating than just conversing between friends/family. One thing that has really frustrated me about modern dating is this idea that everyone is somehow ""too busy"" to text back. I understand not wanting to message someone back and forth, especially when it's early in a relationship, every couple of hours. That's exhausting and we all have day jobs/hobbies we want to pursue and not be constantly trying to think how to keep someone we barely know, or maybe haven't even met yet, entertained through our words.

That said, I think it's way too common these days for people to claim they don't text back within 24ish hours because they're ""too busy"". I get that life is sometimes unpredictable and things break/shit happens. I work in a pretty demanding job and I have periods too where I basically have to be heads down and really focus on something for 14+ hours a day. The thing is, I don't believe that:

1. Most peoples' jobs are THAT demanding. From what I've seen/read online, most people do maybe 4ish hours of work a day and are pretending to be busy the rest of the time
2. This is the more important part: I know for me personally that if I really like a girl, I'll respond to her by EOD. For one, it realistically only takes 5-10 mins max to think of something and type it out. Even if I worked 14 hours that day, I can still find 5 mins before bed to text someone I'm into before I fall asleep at worst. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see how it'd be different from a woman's perspective if she were really into me
3. IME, whenever I start talking to a girl over the phone, we generally feel each other out and naturally come up with a ""rhythm"", for lack of better word, of how often we communicate. The two things I've noticed are that if a girl is really into me, she'll text me back come hell or high water. The second is that the minute this ""rhythm"" starts getting extended, that's when things have gone south.

15s891q,"CMV: The conservatives who complain ""Why are we sending money to Ukraine instead of helping people here at home in America?"" wouldn't want that money to be spent on people in America, either.","Since the beginning of the war, a certain Trumpish faction of Republicans has been arguing that we shouldn't spend money on helping Ukraine ""because of the domestic needs at home.""

The first problem with this is that the amount of money the U.S. has sent to Ukraine is actually only a tiny percentage of GDP/federal budget, and it's for a good cause.

But the second, more pressing, problem is that even if the U.S. never sent any aid to Ukraine, and instead diverted the $70 billion in weaponry and financial aid back to America instead..........most of these Trump-wing conservatives wouldn't want that money spent on Americans either, despite their complaint. I'm talking about the Marjorie-Taylor-Greene type.

If it were spent on school lunches........Republicans have been spending a lot of effort blocking free school lunches.

If it were spent on welfare.......Republicans would complain that that's......well, welfare.

If it were spent helping the homeless...........Republicans would complain that it's helping 'stinky, dirty, lazy homeless people.'

In other words, Republicans don't actually **want** that money spent on helping people, they just want something to complain about.

No. I am not gonna start the rambling about AI and deep fakes or other dumb sh*t like that. That's a different topic for another day. 


This is probably the closest belief to a conspiracy theory I believe. 


This is something we should have done since the beginning of the internet. 


Many things are fake on the internet, or at least have missing contexts. From news on social media, photoshoped/airbrushed models, drama made as an attempt for attention, etc. 


Needless to say most mental health issues, scams, dumb culture and misinformation related to the web are steming from taking the internet at face value. 


Even before AI and pals it is incredibly difficult to verify what's real or not. Not always but at least in *most* cases it sure as hell is.


The remedy to this: Assume everything you read is fake. 


Example: If one assume everything he/she reads is fake (or at least take it with a massive grain of salt) then it will be more difficult to be scammed, feel bad for oneself or get fooled by the internet.



You're almost never sure who's behind the screen. 


I could be Linus from LTT in an alt account, or that pyramid girl iilluminaughtii. Maybe PewDiePie?


Maybe I am Alex Jones, ChatGPT, Dream or snooroar. I could very easily be a bot.

15xjb56,CMV: Having kids is great,"We often get posts here about kids, usually about how awful it is that society expects people to become parents, how having kids is selfish and environmentally unfriendly or how having kids will ruin your life. It’s very hard to respond to these posts because telling people who don’t want kids that kids are great and that they should have them is a bit of a dick move. However, this subreddit is all about expressing and defending opinions, me writing this isn’t about convincing others, it’s about defending a view that’s rarely expressed here.  
Before I explain why kids are great I need to set a condition, it is possible for something to be great whilst still being expensive, frustrating, tiring or difficult. Many great things are one or all of these things, a safari is amazing but costs a fortune, climbing Everest is one of the hardest but most rewarding things you can do and sometimes my wife is incredibly frustrating, it doesn’t mean she’s not the best thing that’s ever happened to me.  
So why is having kids great? It boils down to two main things, one, they’re great fun and two, you get to experience how wondrous the world is through their discoveries. We never stop enjoying play but, as we get older, we get responsibilities and mature, we still like play but we limit how much of it we do and the play we do do we often take seriously. Kids don’t suffer from this, they don’t have our ego, they just want to imagine and pretend and race and climb and build. It’s a pure form of play that adults have often forgotten but we get to experience again with kids. The other day I pretended my three year old daughter could electrocute me. We spent a good 10 minutes of her touching me, me pretending to get an electric shock and her laughing like crazy. It was joyous and wonderful and I rarely experience anything close to it in my wider life, my daughter and I do something like that 5 times a day, it’s incredibly fun.  
The other thing is less obvious. One of the most rewarding things we can do as adults is to achieve something we’ve never done before, the older we get the less this happens. For kids this happens like clockwork, especially early on. Seriously the pride a child feels the first time they pull on their socks is wild and guess what, the parent feels it too. Rolling over, seeing a duck, eating with a fork, catching a ball and don’t even get me started on their first steps, these are all incredible experiences and you experience them along with your child. Children reframe what life is, the most mundane things for an adult are an incredible adventure for kids. Last week I flew with my kids for the first time, I filmed them as the plane took off, it was like we were on the greatest roller coaster ever built.  
Kids give you an experience that is unlike anything else in my adult life and, despite the tantrums, despite the mess and the constant need for attention, that is absolutely worth it. Here’s the other wonderful thing, I haven’t lost the adult stuff either. It takes a bit more work but I get to go out with my friends and do all the kid free stuff I used to, I still have both worlds. Having kids is great, Change my view.

15xx5if,CMV: We need a non vegan animal rights movement,"Feel free to argue we don't need an animal rights movement, or that it has to be vegan.

As a preface, I have no issue with vegans. I think they are admirable in their dedication for something they care so much about. I do think veganism as a movement is counter productive, and will elaborate below. 

When I say a non vegan animal rights movement, I mean a movement that is primarily lead by non vegans and supported by non vegans. This is because I think this is the only way to really pressure governments to create and truly enforce animal rights.

Yes this means that I don't think animals desperately need the right to free movement, or the right to not be killed. In my opinion the current discourse around animal abuse leads to the majority of people just not engaging. 

What rights do a realistically think we could get animals? The right to not be tortured, the right to nutrition, the right to free roaming in an enclosed outdoor area, the right to clean living spaces. 

Is this perfect and amazing for animals? It's a lot better than what we have now and honestly I'm so frustrated with the idea that we should do nothing instead of ending animal abuse because it's not full emancipation. 

The fact is that individuals changing their diet makes almost no impact on the meat industry. Far more people are being born than are going vegan. The world is not going to go vegan! Also, if you are truly convinced that eating less meat will reduce factory farming, convincing 50% of the population to eat plant based one day a week would roughly double the impact of the current vegan population. (3% of vegans vs 1/7/half the population = 7% reduction in meat consumption) not to mention it would allow many more people to discover plant based food they like, and may eat that more.

The whole thing where we identify ourselves as vegan and eat no meat ever is completely non productive and in my opinion, has slowed down any movement on animal rights to a standstill.

I know it's not fully representative but just check out the vegan sub talking about someone eating less meat and how inadequacy it is. They will tell people to break up with their spouse because they decided they couldn't fully commit to veganism after all. 

Imagine if we decided anyone who drives a car is an enemy and cant advocate for climate awareness. Imagine how little that movement would be accomplishing if it was so exclusive and judgemental. 

We don't need to imagine it for veganism. It's accomplishing absolutely nothing right now. More meat is being eaten than ever and more animals are being abused than ever. Idealism will not save these animals from torture.

15y5y4j,CMV: Hard work pays off is BS,"Complete and utter BS. The entire notion of ""hard work pays off"" is just manipulative to the everyday employee. Especially since the idea of ""hard work"" is totally subjective.

If the hardest workers reaped the most rewards, then roofers and coal miners would be the richest people in society. 

The real truth is that investment of time in the right places pays off. I worked my ass off in blue-collar, and, at some point, you hit a cap. There's only so many hours in a week and only so much you can work. You can sacrifice every personal/social event in your life to work all the overtime you can, but you'll always hit a cap.

I became tired, and my health was suffering. I fell into a deep depression. All of my coworkers started calling me lazy when I started rejecting the overtime. I invested time into earning certifications in a different field. This was an easy thing to do here and there. My certifications put me in another position, making double the money with half the hours and a fraction of the labor.

Was it hard work? Nope. I assure you that in comparison, sitting in front of my computer for a couple hours on the weekends was a LOT easier than working 15+ extra hours at my job where I was killing myself with the workload.

I promise you, you can live a good life working hard, but you will live a great life working smart.

Ofcourse it's true that if you're not working at all, you won't achieve anything. And ofcourse it's true that if you work really hard you might get a promotion that puts you in a better place, but my point is ""hard work"" always has a cap. At some point it becomes less about the workload you complete, and about where you invest your time.

You'll hit a wall, and the only way to move up after a certain point is to build connections and invest time/money into yourself. Nepotism is very real, and it will throw your hard work out the window.

You can buy water once you get past TSA, but it's always much more expensive than water you'd buy outside of the airport. It's a price gouging scam.

Since the TSA agents put the gender they assume a passenger to be into the machine, and it scans that way (if an agent puts male in for someone who is biologically female, their breasts will get flagged), LGBTQ passengers who's appearance may not match their physical sex are often flagged by the scanners and forced into a patdown. Breastfeeding mothers are also often required to have their breast milk tested, which is ridiculous.

I believe the best solution is to replace the TSA's current system with metal detectors. The metal detectors would be able to identify weapons better than body scanners, since metal detectors just search for metal. Metal detectors would also deal with the discrimination issue since it isn't scanning for body shapes, just metal.

161yf92,CMV: The seven dwarves are not supposed to be people with dwarfism. It’s idiotic that Disney will not feature dwarves in their remake of Snow White.,"In case you aren't aware, Disney is remaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. But, there are no longer going to be any dwarves. Instead, there are going to be seven magical forest creatures. From what I can tell, Disney is doing this because they think it’s not politically correct to make a movie featuring dwarves. This is idiotic 

**Fantasy dwarves are not people with dwarfism**

Fantasy dwarves are not meant to represent individuals with the medical condition of dwarfism. In fantasy, dwarves are usually depicted as stout, bearded beings, distinct from humans. They don’t have the same proportions as people with the real medical condition. 

Fantasy dwarves are not people with dwarfism any more than giants are people with gigantism. The same goes for gnomes, hobbits, leprechauns, etc. These diminutive beings are distinct creatures, not people with real medical conditions. Santa’s workshop is not staffed by people with dwarfism. 

**How to cast dwarf characters**

Disney is correct for worrying that its problematic to cast people with dwarfism to play fantasy dwarves. Its potentially belittling because it portrays people with a real medical condition as being like silly magical creatures. 

But, this doesn't mean that fantasy dwarves can never appear in movies. It means you shouldn't cast people with dwarfism to play them. You follow the blueprint laid out by Perter Jackson. You cast an ordinary actor, and then you use movie magic to make them shorter. 

**Disney's current casting choices are offensive**

Furthermore, I would say that Disney has not avoided controversy by eliminating references to dwarves. Here's a cast picture:

https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/14/12/73212119-12298801-image-a-139_1689332652585.jpg

They've cast at least 1 person with dwarfism to play these magical forest creatures. As I argued above, this is belittling towards people with dwarfism. They are portraying people with a real medical condition as being whimsical creatures. Despite their efforts, I think people can legitimately argue that this movie will be disrespectful towards people with dwarfism. 

Disney has totally misunderstood the nuances of this situation. There would have been no problem if they cast actors in Peter Jackson style costumes to play the dwarves. But, by casting a person with dwarfism to play a magical forest creature, Disney has done something that's actually offensive. They gain nothing by avoiding the word ""dwarf"".",damndirtyape,993,0.8899999856948853,486,1693064242,2023-08-26 10:37:22,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/161yf92/cmv_the_seven_dwarves_are_not_supposed_to_be/,8,2023

Corinthians 8:9

As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.

1644dcp,CMV: The government should pay people €100k euro if they donate a kidney to someone who needs one,"I'm going to use numbers from my own countries as reference:  

In Belgium, a year's worth of dialysis treatment costs the government roughly €60k per year per patient. Meanwhile, a kidney from a healthy live donor lasts on average between 15-20 years with relatively minimal other costs after transplant.   
So let's assume 15 years of dialysis saved on average that would mean that 1 transplant saves the government roughly €800k (assuming €100k in total for surgery + medical follow-up of donor and recipient).   

I think to encourage more people to donate their kidney, the government should pay people €100k. Even with such a large payment, it would still lead to big savings for the government. And obviously, the recipient would benefit greatly as well due to massively increased QoL.    

And because I know people will bring up the health impacts on the donor: I don't consider this to be enough of an impact to not implement this plan. A thoroughly screened and healthy donor sees an extremely limited (if any) impact on their life. A month after the surgery, the donor can resume life as normal without any restrictions whatsoever. And the odds of developing kidney failure later in life are also very small when properly screened.    

And even if kidney failure is developed, there would be plenty of donors ready to give a kidney due to the high payment involved.",SuckMyBike,428,0.800000011920929,428,1693272003,2023-08-28 20:20:03,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1644dcp/cmv_the_government_should_pay_people_100k_euro_if/,8,2023

Reparations should take a more indirect form, things like tax breaks and investment in communities rather than just handing people a bunch of money and telling them to spend it wisely.

Of course reparations is a little vague, but the most common sum Ive seen is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is quite a lot for the average person. You only have to look at lottery winners to see that giving ordinary people large sums of money is a bad combination. 

There's also the issue of how much would be given out. The most common sum I have seen is 250-300k, but Ive also seen 1 million thrown around which if true would cost almost 6 times the annual us budget.

It also seems like it could become a slippery slope.

165b0px,CMV: Drinking age should be lowered in the US,"There are several reasons I think the drinking age in the US should be lowered from 21 to either 18 or 19.

1. most people ignore this law and drink before they’re 21. It’s odd to have a law that the majority of the population breaks. IMO it creates a disrespect for the law in general.

2. When I went to college, because I wasn’t allowed to get alcohol safely, at a restaurant with friends, our only option was to go to a frat house and drink the punch that they could have put anything inside of. I personally know a girl that was raped after a frat party. Outlawing drinking until you’re 21 just makes people put themselves in dangerous positions to drink.

3. The age was raised to 21 in order to lower the amount of drunk drivers. I agree if you drive after drinking then you’re a terrible person. But the type of person who would drive drunk definitely isn’t the type of person who would listen to the law about waiting until you’re 21 to drink.

4. When I joined my sorority the very first meeting they had all the new members bring photos of ourselves we took at CVS along with filling out a form with our info. They did this so they could place an order for fake ID’s for all the new members. My point in sharing this is to show how common fake ID’s are. Like most freshmen in college get fake ID’s.

165sjkh,CMV: The US Should Mandate all Fees/Expenses be Disclosed Up Front As Much As Possible,"I believe the United States should legally require ticket sellers like Ticketmaster to provide prices inclusive of all fees and surcharges when shopping for tickets.

Hidden fees distort the free market and make it harder for customers to fairly do price comparisons. These fees are deceptive and can often add up to 40% of the advertised price.

I’m tired of clicking on a $49 dollar ticket for a show to find out it’s really $70 when I go to checkout.  Or a $50/night hotel room having a mandatory $30/night “resort fee”

Similar policy should apply to things like hotel rooms, car rentals, phone bills and all sorts of other consumer purchased goods.

If a fee is variable (like shipping) or taxes, I could see that not being included in an advertised price if they can’t be reasonably determined at the time of advertising.  a TV commercial for a national brand, they could say “$499 + tax” since the tax is different everywhere.

However, for sales where the tax CAN be determined, it should be included in the price.  A hotel room should advertise the total price, since the tax calculation is based on where the hotel is, and can be reasonably determined at the time of advertising.

This greater price transparency would greatly benefit consumers.",Front_Many_6231,430,0.949999988079071,214,1693433781,2023-08-30 17:16:21,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/165sjkh/cmv_the_us_should_mandate_all_feesexpenses_be/,8,2023

166h3ge,CMV: Most people would not speak out or fight against slavery/genocide/apartheid/theocracy if they lived in such a society.,"Many students in the USA and Europe are understandably horrified by what happened in the past. They read about how a popular dictator like Hitler genocided Jews and other groups. Or how several European societies were complicit in chattel slavery and brutal colonialism. Or how the USA and other countries wiped out entire native tribes and fiercely subjugated their non-white populations. They also wonder why don't the citizens of Russia try to overthrow Putin's regime or why the women in Saudi Arabia tolerate being second-class citizens with little autonomy. From the student's point of view, these are clear and egregious human rights violations and it is any sane and moral person's duty to oppose such a government or institution.

What is often ignored is that the average person (especially in developing nations or historical states) has many personal problems and is just trying to live their day-to-day lives. Going on a huge and dangerous moral crusade to save a group of people you don't even belong to and might not even be able to pay you back seems completely foolhardy from their perspective. What you also must understand is that nobody is born in a completely neutral environment; morals and beliefs all come from somewhere. The people who partook in any historical atrocity or even merely ""looked the other way"" were fed ton of propaganda from birth justifying how abusing/killing the bad people is righteous and in-line with what God wants. The people in such societies have access to completely different information/technology than what modern Western kids have along with a different lifestyle. And it is not like modern westerners don't have their own biases and ignorant beliefs as well.

Before being offended that people in another land or in another time are committing major atrocities, how about some people try to fix the major wrongdoings going on in their own homeland first. Let's focus on the USA since most Redditors are from there. How many Americans support prison reform? How many Americans support animal rights? How many Americans want to stop climate change? How many Americans actually engage in protests? How many Americans even bother to boycott?

Everyone likes to imagine they would be the hero, but in reality, they would probably only join the heroes once their victory is inevitable. Assuming you aren't a member of the persecuted group, your average person nowadays wouldn't oppose chattel slavery if they were born in the 18th Century New World. The average person wouldn't oppose The Holocaust if they were a German during the 1930s/1940s, the average person wouldn't oppose the apartheid if they were a White South African in the 1960s. The average person wouldn't join a secular revolution if they lived in an Arab theocracy. This is not to say brave revolutionaries don't exist, or otherwise societies would never change. But revolutions more often succeed due to external forces and extra-political factors than they do to brave heroes finally saying enough is enough and standing up for what is right.

To change my view, you have to demonstrate that either ""evil regimes"" have a lot less popular support than I think, or that a significant part of the population opposing an atrocity that doesn't directly affect them is actually quite common.",Utopia_Builder,430,0.8899999856948853,231,1693502396,2023-08-31 12:19:56,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/166h3ge/cmv_most_people_would_not_speak_out_or_fight/,8,2023

When politicians can knowingly lie without fear of consequences it creates a rift on uncertainty and inherent mistrust between the Civil Servant and the people they represent.

I believe that a sworn in Politician who at any time they are acting in an official capacity should be subject to perjury charges if it can be shown that they knowingly lied.

My first thought regarding this is freedom of speech of the politician, however there is already a precedent for temporary removal of that right with members of the Armed Forces, so I don't see why Politicians can't have a similar requirement.

16ah8yk,"CMV: The current system set up benefits only a few is not a conspiracy. The media is owned by wallstreet. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act gave banks too much power. They should've reinstated Glass-Steagall in 2008. Banks became too big to prosecute, a perfect example is JPMorgan. Also Hedge funds are shady.","The banks are out of control. They are the main reason for the growing wealth gap. They own the companies that own the shares in these companies that govern how they operate. All of the major media outlets are owned by a small circle of people. Look at the institutional ownership of some of the media corporations like comcast. Even reddit is compromised, given some of it's weird rules coming out about brigading and cross-posting. 

As someone who has spent the last 3 years following reddit, the markets and news, I have witnessed firsthand the alarming activities of hedge funds and banks that pose a significant risk to our financial world.   
  
The Glass-Steagall Act served as a crucial safeguard against excessive risk-taking by banks. By separating commercial banking from investment banking, it prevented banks from engaging in speculative activities that could endanger depositors' funds. However, its repeal has allowed banks to enter into risky ventures such as hedge funds without adequate oversight.  
  
One of the most concerning aspects of this repeal is that hedge funds are exempt from anti-money laundering rules set forth in the Patriot Act. This exemption creates an environment where illicit financial activities can thrive unchecked, posing serious threats to our national security and economic stability.

The recent history of JPMorgan Chase serves as a stark reminder of why reinstating Glass-Steagall is imperative. JPMorgan's ""too big to fail"" status has shielded it from prosecution for its involvement in various scandals and illegal practices. This lack of accountability not only undermines public trust but also perpetuates a dangerous moral hazard within these powerful institutions.

The concentration of wealth among a few powerful entities exacerbates social inequality and threatens our democratic principles. Reinstating Glass-Steagall would help restore integrity to our markets by curbing excessive risk-taking and preventing further consolidation of power within these institutions.

*""No single regulator has the authority or information to comprehensively assess the risks posed by hedge funds.""*

Janet Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury

Can't link it but this is from WSOP.

*""Take, for example, what happened on June 22 of this year. The SEC issued a Cease-and-Desist order against the securities unit of JPMorgan Chase for permanently* ***deleting 47 million emails****, many of which were under* [subpoena](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2023/34-97787.pdf) *or document requests from its regulators, including the SEC. (One could be forgiven for thinking that sounds a lot like obstruction of justice by a serial lawbreaker. JPMorgan Chase said Deletion-Gate was all one big accident.)*  
*Despite the unprecedented criminal history of this bank – which garnered it a comparison to the Gambino crime family in a book by two trial lawyers – the SEC imposed a minor fine of $4 million for disappearing 47 million emails.* ***That’s 8.5 cents for each permanently destroyed email*** *that might have brought more criminal charges against the bank.""*

All that said I usually try not to paint with too broad a brush. I know not every hedge fund is criminal. Guess I'm just looking for why people wouldn't think the system is rigged in favor of the rich and banks and hedge funds is how they control the economy/markets.

I'm aware I've eaten a lot of tinfoil. Just trying to get out of my echo chamber and see what other people think.

Anti-vaxxers have been a huge harm to public health.

16cj4ib,CMV: Most people's religious beliefs are largely influenced by their societal and familial upbringing rather than a personal search for truth,"I've been thinking a lot about the influence of culture and family on our personal beliefs, especially in the realm of religion. It seems to me that the majority of people tend to follow the religion of their parents or the dominant religion of the region they grew up in. For instance, someone born in a predominantly Christian region might naturally grow up with Christian beliefs, while someone born in the Middle East might be more likely to adopt Islamic beliefs.

While I acknowledge that many individuals do undergo personal spiritual journeys and might change their beliefs over time, I can't help but think that for a significant portion of the global population, religious beliefs are more a product of upbringing and societal constructs than personal exploration.

16clz7l,CMV: Cheating is always wrong.,"Before we start, I want to talk about abusive relationships. This is what people have brought up to defend cheating to me. In my opinion, cheating is defined as being able to safely leave the relationship, but choosing to betray your partner anyway. An abuse victim cannot leave safely and easily. Their partner has already betrayed them by abusing them. Thus, it is impossible for an abuse victim to “cheat” on their abuser. 

This situation is different from a person who would feel really bad if their relationship came to an end, or if they have kids. They’re not putting their life on the line- they’re just shuffling their misery onto their partner/family. 

And that’s really the core of my view. It is always possible to end the relationship before you cheat. It’s not a fun choice, and it can impact your reputation or finances, but it’s a choice you can make. When someone cheats, they’re really just trying to eat their cake and have it, too. 

“What counts as cheating” is a complex topic everyone seems to disagree on. For me, it’s cheating when sex and intimate cuddling is involved. Being friends with someone isn’t cheating. Neglecting your spouse is a bad thing, and something to fix/break up over, but not cheating. 

As for alcohol fueled cheating…I honestly don’t know. I do not drink, so I feel that I don’t have the experience to judge. I’ve heard mixed opinions from those who do. The only thing I’d say is that, if you have control over yourself, it’s cheating.",PercentageMaximum457,253,0.8399999737739563,276,1694108669,2023-09-07 12:44:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16clz7l/cmv_cheating_is_always_wrong/,9,2023

16f3ker,CMV: Writing a letter to a judge as a character reference does not imply you don't believe someone did the bad thing they were convicted of,"This is spurred by the backlash to Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis writing letters as a character reference for Danny Masterson, but it can be applied to many things. 

People convicted of many crimes have others write character references to the judge prior to sentencing, and I don't believe that when that happens they necessarily think the person is innocent.  They are speaking to how they know them outside of the crime committed.  All this is so the judge can get a better picture of the person outside of the crime they have been convicted of and that can influence sentencing.   But at no point is that saying the person is innocent. 

I feel like a lot of the flak Ashton and Mila received is a bit unfair.   They were asked to do this as people who have known him for 20+ years.  They could have said no of course, but he was already going to jail for some period of time.   It didn't say he was innocent.  It didn't say they didn't believe the women who accused him.  All it said was that ""this is the person I know and this is what he did for me"".  

If you feel that these character references have no place in the justice system, that is fine.  But I think being upset that people write them at the request of lawyers is a bit much. 

I also feel that many people would do the same for someone they have known for 20+ years, and people are being a bit hypocritical.    I know if my little brother or close friend committed a crime and was going to jail, it would be hard for me to refuse to do it, even if I agree that they deserve to go to jail.",illini02,777,0.7099999785423279,849,1694360865,2023-09-10 10:47:45,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16f3ker/cmv_writing_a_letter_to_a_judge_as_a_character/,9,2023

16hxvf8,META: Transgender Topics,"# The Rule Change

Beginning immediately, r/changemyview will no longer allow posts related to transgender topics. The reasons for this decision will follow. This decision has not been made lightly by the administration of this subreddit, and has been the topic of months of discussion.

# Background

Over the past 8 months, r/changemyview has been inundated with posts related to transgender topics. I conducted a survey of these posts, and more than 80% of them ended up removed under Rule B. More importantly, a very large proportion of these threads were ultimately removed by Reddit's administrators. This would not be a problem if the topic was an infrequent one. However, for some periods, we have had between 4 and 8 new posts on transgender-related issues per day. Many days, they have made up more than 50% of the topics of discussion in this subreddit.

# Reasoning

If a post is removed by Reddit or by the moderators of this subreddit under B, we consider the thread a failure. Views have not been changed. Lots of people have spent a lot of time researching and making reasoned arguments in favor of or against a position. If the thread is removed, that effort is ultimately wasted. We respect our commenters too much to allow this to continue.

Furthermore, this subreddit was founded to change views on a wide variety of subjects. When a single topic of discussion so overwhelms the subreddit that other topics cannot be easily discussed, that goal is impeded. This is, to my knowledge, only the second time that a topic has become so prevalent as to require this drastic intervention. However, this is not r/changemytransview. This is r/changemyview. If you are interested in reading arguments related to transgender topics, we truly have a thorough and complete treatment of the topic in this subreddit's history.

# The Rule

Pursuant to Rule 4, any thread that touches on transgender issues, even tangentially, will be removed by the automoderator. Attempts to circumvent automoderation will not be treated lightly by the moderation team, as they are indicative of a disdain for our rules. If you don't know enough to avoid the topic and violate our rules, that's not that big of a deal. If you know enough to try to evade the automoderator, that shows a deliberate intent to thwart our rules. Please do not attempt to avoid this rule.

# Conclusion

The moderation team regrets deeply that this decision has been necessary. We will answer any questions in this thread, or in r/ideasforcmv. We will not entertain discussion of this policy in unrelated topics. We will not grant exceptions to this rule. We may revisit this rule if circumstances change. We are unlikely to revisit this rule for at least six months.

Sincerely,

The moderators of r/changemyview",LucidLeviathan,373,0.6200000047683716,1910,1694636928,2023-09-13 15:28:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16hxvf8/meta_transgender_topics/,9,2023

16ia8w6,CMV: Changing Snow White's race is parallel to changing Black Panther's race,"A new remake of Snow White is currently being made and they've, controversially, changed Snow White’s race. I disagree with this; it comes off as virtue signalling. The character's race was changed to be more diverse, presumably.  
  
Now, I don't see what makes the change in Snow White's ethnicity any different to changing Black Panther to a different ethnicity or race. Snow White’s ethnicity and complexion are integral to her character, hence her name. One relatively 'big' part of the story is her complexion and how she is the ‘fairest of them all,’ and unique because of it. Similarly, Black Panther’s name originates from the Black Panther party and his race is relatively important compared to most characters. \`  
  
Even as a person who leans left (essentially centrist), there is the double standard that much of the left holds. The double standard is the opinion or view that changing a white person’s race is okay, or perhaps even great, but changing a black person’s race is racist and deemed whitewashing. I understand there is some nuance here but I still believe the two things are on a similar level. Whitewashing is bad because it pushes forward the message that being black is ‘bad’ or not desirable. Blackwashing should be seen as bad as it pushes forward the message that whiteness is not desirable. Perhaps the intention of blackwashing in media is to be diverse, but again, I find this to be virtue signalling and there are better ways to go about this… just make new characters or new movies.  
  
In my opinion, race should not be changed if it’s an original and old character, particularly if it’s relatively integral to the character’s identity. Just make new characters.  
  
I assume that I will get replies that point out that Snow White is not Disney’s story and there are many different versions, thus, it’s not necessarily race-swapping characters. But that’s wrong:  
  


>  
Snow White is a live-action remake of the Disney animation classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" which debuted in 1937. However, it appears that Disney is approaching the seven dwarf characters in a new way in order to avoid reiterating prejudices from the first animated feature. The lead actress Zegler also hinted at the story's contemporary revisions meant to appeal to the progressive audience during the D23 event.[\[1\]](https://collider.com/snow-white-disney-live-action-remake-release-date-cast-plot/)

  
  
The issue is that Disney and other massive corporations are making *\[x\]* and then advertising it as *\[y\]*. The only reason for this is because these corporations want a bigger audience so they grab nostalgic stories such as Snow White and other classics and then reboot them to get a guaranteed audience. For example, Velma, a TV series where they race-swapped Velma, is hardly the original character- neither are the rest of the characters, really. They marketed the series as Scooby-Doo characters to gain instant and free traction despite the fact they are hardly even the same characters.   
  
So yeah, that’s basically my view. I just don’t agree with the race-swapping of random characters and I think that race-swapping Black Panther is of the same nature as race-swapping Snow White.

My mom is definitely one of them and I don't think she deserves to have a good relationship with me today, or any relationship at all. 

Around the age of 11 she stopped being affectionate with me. No more hugs, no more kisses, no more cute nicknames, no more good nights in bed.

In middle school, she would criticize my only friend and call her weird, and told me I was becoming weird like her (I became insecure)

She called me an idiot very regularly during that period, compared me to others, belittled me.

She constantly criticized and judged my personality, the way I ate, the way I spoke, the way I behaved, what I talked about, the fact that I was close to my friends...

She wasn't the type of mom who talked to me, asked me how my day was at school, laughed with me, was affectionate, smiled at me... when she spoke to me it was only criticism and negativity.

She was always grumpy and moody. I very rarely saw her smile at home and she always looked at me with side eyes and disgust when I passed in the living room. Because of that, I stayed in my room a lot and almost never spoke to her. She blamed me a lot for that.

I wasn't allowed to invite friends. I wasn't allowed to go to my friends' houses. I wasn't allowed to go out with friends after school, on weekends or during vacations even when I was 20 (or even alone, I never went out except to go to school). I wasn't allowed to have a phone or wear makeup until I was 18. She never gave me money so I couldn't buy anything on my own until I was 18 when I was finally financially independent. I was never allowed to cut my hair. I wasn't allowed to dye my hair either. I wasn't allowed to go to parties even when I was in college. I wasn't allowed to have a boyfriend, especially if he wasn't Muslim. My life was just school and home, I could only go out with my older sister or my mom and my aunt. I would do things behind her back and lie to her because all I asked was ""no"" 90% of the time. No concerts, no trips, no movies, no sleepovers, no beaches, no festivals, no parties, no birthdays even when my friends invited me. She deprived me of many of the pleasures one experiences at that age.

Every time I did things that went against her, something she didn't like, she became very aggressive. She screamed, insulted me (whore, crazy, scum..), grabbed my neck or my arms aggressively, squeezing, spat on me and became even crazier when I held her arms to stop her from hurting me. Sometimes she closed the shutter and the door of my room and forced me to sleep even at 7-8 p.m. after her tantrum.

Her grudge would last for days. She would remind me that she is the mother and that she has all the rights, that I must respect her and do everything she says. She threatened me that I wouldn't go anywhere and that if I tried to escape, she would find me. She had her crazy moments where she would tell me that she wished that I would get sick and disappear so that she would be alone, or that if I tried to escape, she would take a knife and  would stab me and go to jail for that. She's already had phrases like ""you're not my daughter anymore"" (when I was in middle school) or ""shouldn't I have aborted that one?""  in a fit of anger.

Today I'm 26 and I no longer live with her. She changed and became nicer, she has made efforts to sort things out and wish to have a good mother/daughter relationship with me. I still don't think she deserves to have me in her life. Same for other moms who did similar things. I know it's hard being a parent but nothing justifies abuse and toxicity.",Petite_Curious,618,0.8799999952316284,308,1694696840,2023-09-14 08:07:20,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ii0kt/cmv_bad_moms_dont_deserve_their_childs/,9,2023
16jqlft,CMV: I feel that xmen being oppressed isn't realistic,"Hopefully this is a fresh topic. 

Now I'll be honest I never read the comics. Maybe some issue addressed this... but movie and TV show xmen is kind of lame.

I feel like reality is that if xmen type exist the x men wouldn't be persecuted. They wouldn't even try to hide. people with like magneto powers would just level the world.

yeah magneto isn't a god or invicible. But I really don't believe at least some country there wouldn't be someone who just forcefully take over the already unstable government. Like let's say Afghanistan. Or smaller communities Wouldn't prop themselves up as gods and make themselves a militia or something. 

Like it might be me but I'm sure some people would fear them enough to be submissive to them. I also feel xmen would give me a winning edge.

And if I was a power hungry madman I'd definitely collaborate with the xmen. Let's say I am someone (I'm not) who is Russian or whatever who wants to see my country conquer the world, I'd oust the weak human and make sure the xman is the leader. (or woman) then we employ an army of men.

I also don't believe that tech could develop fast enough to neutralize the mutants. we couldn't get covid under control.

16kcvv6,"CMV: it is morally and logically inconsistent to advocate for two murder charges in the event of the homocide of a pregnant woman, and to be believe that abortion should be legal at the same time","

So, I’m not against abortion  and I’m certainly not defending murderers of pregnant women, I just think this is an interesting test for moral consistency. Also, moral tests are inherently not easy situations, so there’s gonna be an outcome that feels shitty to a lot of people if moral consistency is achieved in this case, at least in my view. I’ve realized this also applies to cases where miscarriage is brought on by physical violence, I’m not gonna edit the whole thing to say that but just know that it is is included in every point unless it’s specifically about abortion. And to clarify, in this case I’m obviously not saying it’s morally inconsistent to charge the person who violently caused the miscarriage with *any* crime, just the murder of the fetus. 

I think it’s pretty simple reasoning: if someone believes the murderer should get an additional charge for the death of the fetus, that means the fetus should be classified as a human being in the eyes of the law. If someone gets an abortion the fetus goes from being alive to being dead, if a fetus is classified as a human being, there’s no reason this shouldn’t count as a murder. In fact, it seems like it would fit the criteria of solicitation of murder, with the mother (and anyone else who supported the abortion) being the solicitor, and the doctor who performed the operation (along with anyone who willfully aided specifically the abortion) being the actual murderer. To claim that it’s different when the mother does it while carrying the child would mean that the perpetrator of a killing determines whether it is lawful or murder. Apply this to self defense and it gets… real bad real quick. I understand that there is a difference, that difference being that the mother is carrying the fetus in the womb, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a human life being killed, if we accept that premise from the charges of murder for the fetus.",LEMO2000,283,0.6899999976158142,1208,1694884829,2023-09-16 12:20:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16kcvv6/cmv_it_is_morally_and_logically_inconsistent_to/,9,2023

Musk is using Twitter for power, it doesn't matter how much money it's losing. Running Twitter lets him exert outsized influence in world affairs without ever having to be elected. Hell, it even lets him wave his Lil Elon around without having to be a very good businessman (I don't know enough to say whether he is or isn't btw).

Also, all of his decisions with checkmarks, and bans, and renaming are flexes. People may complain, but they're not leaving. All the impotent hate probably amuses him and stokes his shitty ego.

And I can bet he will continue using his fortune to keep on subsidizing Twitter even if it's losing money. In the greater scheme of things, keeping it is probably good for his bottom line.

16m0711,"CMV: Under a totalitarian regime, most of us would not be resisters.","A lot of people want to believe that if they had 'been there', in Nazi Germany for example, that they would have resisted. They would have risked their lives to help ordinary people escape a murderous totalitarian government. 

And some people did. Oskar Schindler is an example of that. They made a movie about him because he was an outlier. What he did was very unusual, and that's why it was so interesting. He was in the right place at the right time to help a lot of people. Many ordinary people resisted in small ways, or even in incredibly courageous ways.

But as far as I know, the majority of people either complied, looked the other way and let it happen, or were themselves active agents in the atrocities of that regime. Remember also the extent of the government propaganda at that time. I find it unlikely that most regular people were *fully* aware of what was going on and/or why it was so indefensible. 

This isn't to say that none of you would have stood up to the government. If you have ever said ""no"" to a policeman who was pointing a gun at you, or if you have ever knowingly committed a capital crime in order to save someone's life, you may well have had the courage to be a resister. But if you have never been in that kind of situation, how can you know what you would have done? We don't live under that kind of political system, and I don't think we can really imagine how afraid people were.

None of this excuses what people did. Choosing to harm someone in order to save your own life is still a choice. My opinion is that we cannot truly know what choice we would have made under those circumstances unless we have experienced a very similar situation in our own lives. It's hard to look that truth in the eye, isn't it?

To change my view, you would have to convince me that under a genuinely totalitarian government comparable to the Third Reich, in which resistance is punishable by summary execution, generally more than half of the citizens are resisters. Not only in the beginning; it is easy enough to resist before a regime seizes extreme power. I am talking about resisting even after the government has begun openly killing dissenters.

I'd love to be wrong about this.

16m25zs,CMV: Far-left “tankie” media is harmful to democracy.,"I know the word “tankies” has had a lot of meanings throughout history. For the purposes of this post it refers to the modern way it’s commonly used, i.e. far-left “anti-imperialists” who tend to hate the nebulous West. 

I’m talking about the Grayzone/Multipolarista types, the Max Blumenthals, Ben Nortons, and their ilk. To them, the concept of democracy is secondary to the demise of Western power. 

They present themselves as anti-imperialists because they ostensibly support the liberation of smaller “global south” nations under the grip of global hegemony. Now, I’m all for anti-imperialism in principle, every country should have the maximum amount of self determination possible to shepherd their people into as prosperous a future as possible without some big power boot on their neck. 100%. 

The problem I have with tankies in this context is that anti-imperialism should be pro-democracy. But that is not what’s emanating from these circles. 

In practice, what it looks like is simply being anti-West. If the US, Europe, or their allies are in *any* way even tangentially involved in some geopolitical conflict or dispute, it doesn’t matter what the conflict is, or where it is, or what the motivations are, or who is involved, or what they are doing, the other side is *always right* to these people. 

They seem to giddily support all manner of autocratic brutality as long as it is done in the service of damaging the West’s influence in the world. Everything is a zero-sum game, and the West must never win it no matter what the cost. 

They deny atrocities and push any manner of conspiracy theories (White helmets being false flag terrorists. China not committing atrocities against Uyghurs, no chemical weapons use in Syria, etc.) that would put their favorite dictators in a bad light and, by extension, advance the Western position. 

Look at Syria, Russia, China, Venezuela, Cuba, etc. There is seldom even the slightest, most tepid condemnation for the crimes that these governments impose on their own people and others, because they are “fighting” or “resisting” western influence, and by virtue of that, they can do no wrong in the context of this great power struggle. 

I have yet to see any evidence that they would be willing to forcefully condemn “non-west” dictators for anything they do, as long as the US/Europe oppose them, or any evidence that they would support a democratic cause if it would somehow benefit the west at the expense of great power rivals, but I'm open to hearing opposing views.",BrokkenArrow,234,0.6399999856948853,469,1695059287,2023-09-18 12:48:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16m25zs/cmv_farleft_tankie_media_is_harmful_to_democracy/,9,2023
16mnb8a,CMV: Millennials and Gen Z are Screwed. Perhaps Irredeemably So...,"In the past decade and a half, the media has been full of stories about how [entitled](https://incafrica.com/ryan-jenkins/this-is-why-millennials-are-entitled.html), [lazy](https://africa.businessinsider.com/careers/gen-z-workers-are-lazy-some-bosses-say-they-dont-do-anything-unless-every-second-of/57pqptd) and unambitious the millennials and gen z cohort are. I do not believe this is entirely accurate for the following reasons:

1. **Academic Inflation (Modern Job Market > Kumite) :** The increased number of kids going to college has been a double edged sword. On one hand, the increased amount of college educated kids means that we have a more sceptical and literate populations which may be good for society. However, while research does seem to suggest that Gen-Z and Millennials are by some metrics the [most educated generation in many countries history's](https://www.businessinsider.in/policy/economy/news/millennials-have-struggled-to-find-well-paid-jobs-despite-being-the-most-educated-generation-its-because-there-are-more-college-degrees-but-fewer-jobs-that-require-them-/articleshow/93913920.cms), it also means that there is suddenly an abundant supply of talent for companies. And all of this ignores the effects of automation, introduction of minorities into the workforce and immigration. The end result of this process is academic inflation which that it has gotten a lot more difficult for the young to secure [jobs](https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/gen-z-set-more-qualified-29264859). Most people that know a Millennial/Gen Z have probably heard of one horror story of how tough it seems to be to get into employment in the modern job market. I believe that this situation is unsalvageable because increasingly we start to see power law distributions being caused by a Matthew effect (i.e. Those lucky enough to gain experience are hounded for jobs while those without are stuck in a loop in which they become more and more undesirable as candidates.) 
2. **Wage Stagnation (Where'd All The Good Jobs Go?):** Following up on my previous point of there being an oversupply of labour, companies have felt no real incentive to hike wages to keep talent. If talent is no longer scarce and can be obtained for cheap due to market . All this has been going on while the cost of living has been on the rise making it a lot [harder](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/wages-have-fallen-43-for-millennials-no-wonder-they-ve-lost-hope/) for people working in these positions to keep up with the cost of living. 
3. **Climate Change (Don't Look Up...No Really):** This one is a lot more controversial. It is well known that our climate is changing. Most of this change is being driven by human activity and is set to have [devastating effects](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/harvard-experts-discuss-climate-change-fears/) on life as we know it unless something is done about it. However, most big polluters seem [disinterested in slowing down](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/china-avoids-climate-change-discussion-despite-extreme-weather-2023-08-11/) any pollution efforts if it comes at the cost of their prosperity. Such trends mean that short of a string of very successful scientific breakthroughs, the younger generation seems condemned to live in a world that has far less habitable land area and more susceptible to extreme events. Geoengineering remains a deeply controversial area of research [for many reasons](https://time.com/6264143/geoengineering-climate-scientists-divided/). If things remain as they are, it means we are only left with few other alternatives, the main one being, accept that the situation is irreversible (at least for now,) and buck up and take it.
4. **Sex Recession (An Indicator of Deeper Problems)**: It has been discovered that [marriage](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/does-marriage-make-you-happier/675145/) provides human beings with happiness that is unsurpassed by very few things. This is yet another facet of life in which Millennials/Gen-Zs have been caught lacking by circumstances outside of their control. Due to some of the reasons mentioned above and a lot more that I have left out of this argument, [younger folks are not marrying](https://sundial.csun.edu/168571/print-editions/fact-check-why-younger-generations-are-saying-i-dont/) at the same rates or even showing any interest in performing acts that would make it easier to have a family [(such as engaging in sexual activity.](https://nypost.com/2023/06/01/gen-z-is-having-a-sex-recession-and-here-are-the-reasons-why/)) The impact (and presence, frankly) of hook-up culture has largely been [overblown by the media](https://time.com/88092/hookup-culture-myth-study/) and current statistics show that Gen-Z/Millennials [have a lot less bedroom traffic than their predecessors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2016/08/16/millennials-are-having-less-sex-than-other-gens-but-experts-say-its-probably-fine/?sh=4bc66ee6d958). As [Japan](https://www.newsweek.com/japan-population-decline-births-deaths-demographics-society-1796496), [South Korea](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Work/South-Korea-looks-to-foreign-workers-to-solve-demographic-crisis) and even [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/upshot/china-population-decline.html) will tell you, this is a very difficult trend to reverse. Once men and women are not interested in coming together and starting families, population collapse is almost a certainty.

To end I wish to give the definition of the word, ""entitled"" which is ""Believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment."" From this information, it would seem that such a label cannot apply to Millennials and Gen-Z.  In the words of John Burn-Murdoch, chief data reporter for the Financial Times, ""They have done everything they were told to do, yet the fruits of their labours are proving elusive.""",Zero-zero20,534,0.8100000023841858,448,1695119280,2023-09-19 05:28:00,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16mnb8a/cmv_millennials_and_gen_z_are_screwed_perhaps/,9,2023
16n1skp,CMV: Lauren Boebert's most profitable career move right now is to actually launch an OnlyFans page,"With the attention this video has received coupled with her dwindling hopes for a meaningful position in the Republican party, I believe Lauren Boebert has a huge opportunity to mimic the success Joe Rogan made through podcasting by launching an OnlyFans page and embracing adult content creation.  I base this off the following:

1.  She nearly lost her last election and likely has a more difficult one coming up where she's probably lost a significant amount of support after this fallout. Losing her Congressional seat could be the end of her tenure in DC which also diminishes her national profile. 
2. Politically she seems to be in a hole that may only be put past her by becoming Trump's VP. It's possible Trump would enjoy the optics of being next to her on the campaign trail (and I mean this in a literal sense since it seems insiders have labeled MTG to ugly for him) but I think this is a long shot.
3. Sex work has never been more accepted in this country and it's possible Boebert abandoning politics could quickly win people over by championing the legitimacy of adult content. This kind of brand change would get massive attention and be the wind behind her new platform. This country loves giving celebrities second chances and there are PR firms that could turn her into a folk hero in just a few weeks. 
4. I can tell you as a matter of fact that there is nothing more non-partisan than a penis and you are in denial if you don't think people from every political affiliation would not be interested. The amount of interest and money she would bring in would be astounding right now and may be an easier and less stressful career for her. 

Someone change my mind.

16n2hy7,CMV: The only way someone can believe in a religion like Christianity is if they deliberately hold it to a much lower standard of evidence than they hold everything else.,"Most people who are religious practice perfectly sound judgment and fact-based assessment in most other aspects of their life. 

For instance, if you were a car dealer and you tried to sell a Toyota to a Christian, saying, *""This Camry can give you 300 miles per gallon,""* that Christian wouldn't believe it - and rightfully so. The Christian would demand, ""Give me a tremendous amount of evidence before I'll believe such a wild claim."" 

Same if a finance manager told a religious client, ""*Give me $10,000 today and I'll invest it and make it become $1 million in five years.""* The religious person would be rightfully skeptical. That sort of return on one's money would be well-nigh impossible, barring all but the most extreme circumstances or massive fraud.

Yet somehow, when it comes to all the far-fetched claims - that the Red Sea were literally divided in two so people could walk on dry land, that a Flood drowned all humans save eight but also that animals walked pair by pair into the Ark (including several million species of insects and spiders as well - imagine that), that dead people can resurrect, that Jesus was God Himself on Earth.........many Christians believe those to have literally have happened as well. (Yes, I know, not all are Biblical literalists, but many are.)

Then the only logical way to describe this is that these people hold their own religion to a much looser, lower standard of evidence than they demand of everything else. They hold everything else to a strict standard but hold their religion to a loose standard. (Except for religious people who are also conspiracy-theorist quacks - they hold *everything* to a loose standard.)

Florida law currently prohibits 16 and 17-year-olds from working before 6:30 a.m., after 11:00 p.m., or for more than eight hours when there is school the next day. The bill would do away with those restrictions, as well as the requirement for a 30 minute break after four consecutive hours of work.

I believe these types of laws would allow employers to pay less and offer less benefits, under the guise of providing 'spending money' jobs to teenagers.

16p8ny1,CMV: US Immigration policy is a total shitshow,"I’m the definition of an immigration dove — I love immigrants. I love seeing the varied cultures people bring with them and learning about the values that people of those cultures bring with them. I love hearing the different inflections in the voices of immigrants. I love being able to access foods of dozens of countries in my community. I love the idea that my country could be so great that people uproot their entire lives and those of their families to come here and start over and improve their well-being. 

There are also numerous objective benefits immigrants bring to the USA. I remember one of my college history professors saying that one of the major reasons that the US didn’t undergo a revolution or major social upheaval in the 30’s was the large immigrant population. Our national unemployment is roughly non-existent and our companies need people to work jobs to continue to grow and prosper. If there was ever a time in the last century to have a generous, functional, effective immigration policy, this is it.

Which is not what we have right now. What we have is a total free-for-all at the border, that ultimately serves neither the immigrants hoping to establish a new, better, life in the USA, nor the country as a whole. Let’s start with basic questions of security:

Our federal agencies have very limited operational control of the border. People constantly cross between ports of entry. It’s widely known among federal agencies that cartel operators funnel migrants to mass and cross at particular locations in order to occupy Border Patrol, so they can smuggle contraband in the vacated crossings. The shear mass of numbers of migrants crossing overwhelm the ability of Border Patrol to vet them, allowing only the most cursory of background checks, which will completely miss any criminality in their home country. And this is only for the migrants who surrender themselves/are caught by Border Patrol. Some of the contraband that the cartels smuggle over are human beings who, for one reason or another, want to stay off of the federal government’s radar.

The way most of these migrants are hoping to normalize their status in the United States is the asylum process. Many of them are unaware that at best this is a temporary patch on a system that will eventually leave them in legal limbo. It is easy to claim asylum, but not so easy for it to be granted. To claim it, you pretty much just have to say that you have a credible fear of being persecuted back in your home country. At this point the migrant will receive a notice to appear (NTA) before an immigration judge where that claim will be adjudicated. At the point, the migrant is generally free to go where they please. They may apply for a work permit six months after making this claim. So they can start their lives, get a job, etc. while they are waiting to be actually granted asylum, but what many do not understand is that asylum is only granted for credible fear of persecution based on a narrow set of criteria. Even though it takes years for those asylum claims to be adjudicated, at the end of the day only about 15% of claimants are granted asylum. Because ICE only prioritizes deportations of serious criminals, those who are denied asylum still generally remain in the US, but they have no legal status and are extremely vulnerable to changes in policy or political leadership.

Both of these are batshit crazy ways to run a country: a functionally open border, and a pathway to status normalization that fails 15% of the time. The alternative for a migrant, of course, is to apply for a visa in the legal way, but this is a laughable solution. There is no visa category of “economic immigrant.” You either need to have a family member who is already a citizen, highly educated, professional job qualifications in specific fields, or lots and lots of money. There is NO legal pathway for someone who wants to just come to the United States to be a roofer, or a restaurant worker. Actually, that’s not totally true. There are H2B visas. However, the US only gives out 66,000 of those a year, and they are by statute temporary visas with no pathway to permanent residency. 

This is no way to run a railroad. I have no problem with the number of immigrants coming into the United States, but I do want the government to be sure they are the right ones. Certainly most who are coming are decent people, but the government needs to at least have the ability to sort out the few bad actors and deny them entry. Allowing bad actors and contraband through is a great way to radicalize public opinion against immigration and stoke racial and ethnic resentment and paranoia. It also needs a sane visa process for economic migrants. Having millions of rejected asylum-seekers living underground lives, open to exploitation, and in a precarious legal condition is a terrible way to bring in immigrants. 

I hated the idea of Trump’s wall when he ran on it in 2016, but it pains me to say that I think it needs to be built. It’s definitely not a solution in and of itself, but it can at least start the process of creating an orderly immigration system. Some might ask how the US would pay for improved border security and visa processing (I don’t see this as an ingenuous concern considering US federal spending practices, but it can at least be addressed and knocked down). Well, cartels are charging virtually everyone who crosses the US border between $5000 and $10000 each (taking advantage of our ineptitude to enrich their coffers). Even if we undercut their prices by 50% to charge immigration fees to applicants, these fees would offset much of the cost, and allow migrants to use the remainder of their savings to take routes from their home countries to the United States that are safer than a trek through the Darien Gap and a 1000 mile ride on the top of a Mexican train.

This is long enough already, but one final thought I need to include is that another direct result of this ineptitude is the enabling of the explosive enrichment and growth of the cartels. It’s created an opportunity for them to charge these enormous travel fees to migrants and smuggle contraband of all kinds across the border. Their annual revenue has ballooned into the billions of dollars and the US runs the real risk that in the future they could completely overrun the Mexican government and establish a true narco-state just across the border. (For those thinking that I’m being hyperbolic, Mexico’s annual tax revenue is $22 billion. The cartel’s estimated annual revenue is $13 billion. I know who my money is on in the long term, considering how much more the government has to spend money on other than security compared to the cartels.)

Maybe that’s the kind of thing that will be necessary before the United States takes immigration seriously, but at that point any hope of the sane, generous, orderly immigration policy that I think we need will be lost. There’s no way that’s happening once our southern neighbor become the Republic of Sinaloa.",solishu4,288,0.800000011920929,457,1695384714,2023-09-22 07:11:54,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16p8ny1/cmv_us_immigration_policy_is_a_total_shitshow/,9,2023
16q2x1q,"CMV: All schools should have a mandatory subject about ''after school life'' which cover topics such as student loans, politics and basic law/rights.","The reason for a CMV about this is because to me this sounds like it's obviously a good thing and should most definitely be done, but I'm also fairly certain that there's a reason it's not. I just can't think of a *good* reason as to why it isn't compulsory other than the education system as a whole is outdated and needs an overhaul but it doesn't happen for whatever reason. I don't know too much about this, so excuse the ignorance.   


A subject like this should be compulsory for all students, but passing/failing it has no impact on whether or not they pass school. It should however impact whether or not they're able to apply for a student loan. If they're unable to pass a basic test about how student loans work and what they'll end up paying and the laws about it, then they simply should not be able to get it. It seems irresponsible to have an 18 year old kid take out a contract like that without them understanding the basics of it.   


Other topics covered by this subject should include stuff like basic politics and how the political system works. The consequence for failing this part should be that they're unable to vote ( or at least unable to until a certain age ) with the ability to retake the test as many times as they want, at no cost. I understand some people would strongly disagree with this because they may feel like it's some kind of discrimination and I imagine these would be the same type of people who disagree with voters requiring ID, but I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of people would agree to this. Oh, and also a government ID should be issued to them too at school. Absolutely no reason to not have one. I'm from South Africa and got my ID in grade 10. And if a country like that can get this right, I see no reason for a ''first world'' country to mess it up.   


Of course, this isn't a perfect list of topics that ''should'' be covered, but this is a rough idea on my thoughts. Nitpicking at an oversight or tiny detail is not going to change my view, rather fault the idea itself. The reason I believe this to be the right thing to do has nothing to do with discriminating against illiterate people or people one might believe to be stupid, it is simply there to help someone better understand the world they're stepping into. Failing to understand the basics of something like a loan should be viewed in the same way as failing to understand the contract you're signing where it says '' sign here to  confirm you understand the T&C '', except that this is a test to ensure that you do actually understand the basics of the T&C's

16ryt7y,"CMV: There's nothing wrong with paying people to donate blood, as long as they are monitored to ensure they are not donating too often.","The most common 2 arguments I've heard against paying people for donating blood are:

&#x200B;

* People - especially poor people - may cheat the system to gain more income by donating blood more frequently than is permitted, and thus endanger their own health/safety in the process.
* Paying people for money comes across as mercenary, and ruins the ""generosity"" spirit of the thing - what is supposed to be selfless giving that comes out of the goodness of one's heart is instead motivated by $$$.

&#x200B;

The first objection is one that I fully concur with - there are plenty of people who are desperate enough for money that they might try to donate blood more frequently than is safe for them to. We can't have a pay-to-donate system without it being very comprehensive and rigorous to prevent cheaters.

But the second objection, IMHO, has no merit. We already pay people to donate plasma, and you don't hear many objections about how the money ruins the feel-good nature of the thing. 

Even more importantly, though - the blood shortage is always a serious issue. Given the short shelf life of blood, blood banks and hospitals are always in a situation of need. I don't think that any patient who has just lost a lot of blood in a severe accident and is in danger of losing their life without immediate blood transfusions is ever going to object to blood because ""It was donated by a donor who was just in it for the money, as opposed to being motivated by generosity and kindness."" Need is need.

So if paying people for blood donations is what it takes to solve the always-present blood shortage, I'm fully in favor of it, and I can't see why society should be against it - unless the objection is that such fees would cost too much, but given that America already spends $4 trillion on healthcare every year, I think that paying donors a couple hundred dollars per blood donation would be only a drop in the bucket - and may in fact even *save* money, considering the improvement that increased blood supply would bring to the healthcare system.",SteadfastEnd,299,0.9200000166893004,92,1695664055,2023-09-25 12:47:35,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16ryt7y/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_paying_people_to/,9,2023
16sc1lv,CMV: Police should have to be exemplary members of society and constantly abide by the law or lose their job.,"This isn't a debate on law breaking or if its ever ok. It's calling out the double standards of law enforcement.

Everyone can agree that police should at minimum have sound judgement, not be racist, as well as be trusted to protect and serve their community.

Unfortunately that's not common enough. But let's not stop there.

How many cops have you seen driving around on their cell phones? Speeding without their lights on? Illegally parked and not on a call? Making illegal uturns? Expecting free/ discounted food? When I worked in customer service I even had a cop have a tantrum that I couldn't give them the police discount when they were off the clock (I recognized them, as they were a regular)

Yet when starving, hungry people steal food they throw the book at them and put them in jail. They park where nobody else is allowed to park looking for others speeding, when that's all they do all day. Giving tickets for not stopping long enough for right on red and they don't even brake at the red light when nobody's coming. Etc. But it's a hell worthy offense if anyone else does any of this.

Imo an officer should have a dashcam on them at all times in addition to body cams. If they're speeding with no cause, they lose their job. Riding around holding their cellphones? No job. Any offense they ticket others for, if they are caught doing it, no job.

They can't even follow the law and they're supposed to enforce it? The hypocritical cops should just get fired.

16sssne,CMV: The Ukraine war shows that the much-hated military-industrial complex is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have.,"Few industries are despised more in the West than the military-industrial complex. Prior to the Ukraine war, progressive politicians (and some conservatives as well) constantly railed against the defense industry, questioning why the United States was spending $800 billion a year on the military when that money could have gone towards \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert your cause of choice: education, healthcare, social cause, etc.) instead. Western European nations, by and large, spent relatively little on defense (despite a NATO pledge for each member to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense). When you asked liberal voters what government item they wanted the most to see big budget cuts on, they would almost invariably say the military.

But the Ukraine war suddenly changed the tunes of many such folks. The same folks who decried the billions of dollars spent on weaponry production suddenly fretted about whether the U.S. would be able to manufacture enough 155mm artillery shells in time to assist Ukraine. The same people who thought of the U.S. defense industry as a useless pit for taxpayer dollars to be wasted now complain that we're not sending enough Abrams tanks, ATACMS, Javelins, Stingers or F-16s to Ukraine. The Daily Kos, a very left-leaning publication, has suddenly featured numerous pro-Ukraine articles detailing the need for U.S. military support of Ukraine and the amount of such.

And not to take anything away from the courage and ingenuity of the Ukrainians, who have fought more bravely and cleverly than perhaps any nation we've seen in decades, but it can clearly be seen that if it weren't for the massive amount of Western military assistance that had been given to Ukraine in the form of artillery (Ukraine was on pace to run out of its small Soviet-type artillery arsenal a year ago,) intelligence, portable anti-tank and anti-air missiles, anti-air defense (Kyiv and other major cities were repeatedly vulnerable to Russian air attacks until recently, when Western Gepards/NASAMS/Patriot/IRIS-T arrived), Ukraine would be in a far worse position than it is today. None of that would have been possible without a substantial military-industrial complex in the West.

You can't get this sort of thing on short notice. If the West had neglected defense and a war like the Ukraine conflict had broken out, it would have been impossible to spool up in time. Modern advanced military systems take years to develop. 

All of this shows is that the defense industry of the West - particularly the United States' - is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have. The whole point of a military is similar to that of the function of a fire department - it's not something you **want** to have to use, but you need it to be there for emergencies. (Assuming your military is used for defense, not offense, of course.) Furthermore, the same progressives who complain about $800 billion spent on the military often overlook the fact that the United States spends far **more** than that on healthcare, Medicare, Social Security every year. The military is actually a relatively small component of the U.S. federal budget.

Of course, there are major issues with over-pricing and bloat in the U.S. defense industry (there's no excuse for F-35 development and production to have been the SNAFU that it was,) and much reform is needed. But the Ukraine war has shown that a military-industrial complex is something people like to hate in peacetime, but learn to grasp the value of in wartime.

16tmynl,CMV: You did not defend or protect our country if you have served in the American armed forces in the last 80 years,"Let me quickly get this out of the way: I am an American, and anyone who enlists in the armed forces has my respect, as they are committing to a profession that is hard, dangerous, and often scary. They put more on the line than I ever will in my career...

That being said, I pity our armed forces. Anyone who says that our veterans and active duty personnel ""fought for or protected our country"" is lying to themselves. There has not been a direct threat to America since WW2. I respect the hell out of WW2 vets, for example, as they put their lives on the line to truly protect their country, democracy, and human rights.

But since then, any conflict America has been in were conflicts they arguably shouldn't have stuck their nose in. Whether they were trying to make a statement, were overblowing the threat, or were using it as an excuse for some alternative motive, they were all conflicts that posed little to no threat to America.

Anyways, this post isn't about whether we should or shouldn't have been involved. It's about how I pity our armed forces, as they have been brainwashed to believe they are ""protecting and defending out country"" when, in reality, they are putting their lives on the line just to be a pawn for what the USA wants to do. The military masks the reality with patriotism, selflessness, and the call to duty. This is all bull shit meant to appeal to men and women who are easily persuaded and have few options for their future. (i.e. Living in a small town with no career opportunities, or unable to attend higher education after high school, or people who seek a ""purpose"")

It just makes me sick seeing the military commercials or ROTC recruitment at high schools. They are so blatantly trying to appeal to kids who don't know better, making them feel important by throwing around words like ""patriotism"" and ""duty"" and ""a higher calling."" It's all BS, no different than a cult who recruits their members by telling them exactly what they want to hear even if it's a lie. They are giving these kids a fake purpose just so that they will make sacrifices to accomplish their greedy ambitions. 

It's so messed up and I wonder why no one else sees through it. We blindly praise veterans and active duty personnel for their service, when, in reality, I don't think their service is anything I should be thanking them for. The only people who should be thanking them are the higher ups who gain from their sacrifices.

16tscm2,CMV: I think inceldom is simply an extension of our society's current relationship with personal responsibility,"As opposed to being directly caused by various forms of sexism. Sexism is obviously present in incel communities, but the state of inceldom would still exist absent sexism.

The basic logic:

'I want to have sex with people' --> 'I have not been able to have sex with people' --> 'This is because of various factors outside of my control' --> 'Society should change because this is unfair'

In this case, the change incels would like to have happen is the gender they are attracted to (usually women) should change their standards so that the incels could have sex.

\------

This logic is consistent with other aspects of our society as well:

\- 'I should not have to lose weight, instead society should change their standards of beauty' (and also airlines should increase the size of their seats to accommodate me so I'm more comfortable)

\- 'Something someone said offended me, and therefore it is bad. Rather than just not consume the content anymore, the person should change'

\- 'I was triggered by something someone said. Anything that triggers me is bad. Rather than manage my emotions, the trigger should no longer exist.'

&#x200B;

\------

Finally, I think while there would certainly still be critics, if the issue of incels being associated with a protected class were removed, it would be much more acceptable in mainstream society.

EG - 'White women are often scared of black men for no reason, thus it is unfairly difficult as a black man to establish romantic relationships'. The logic is the same, including the sense that the black man is ""owed"" romantic relationships common in inceldom, but this is much more palatable to modern society than incel culture is.

Thus, it isn't the base logic and reasoning society finds so distasteful; Rather it's the association with white men. A class that is seen as having the most privilege complaining that things aren't fair isn't going to win over a lot of people.

&#x200B;

\- Explain how my understanding of incel culture is completely wrong

\- Explain how there is no valid relationship between incels lack of personal responsibility and the examples I listed; Besides claiming one is less moral/acceptable than the other.

16u7f78,CMV: the expansion of NATO is NOT what prompted Russia to invade Ukraine,"More specifically, my current position is that the expansion of NATO would have been an insignificant factor in the decision to invade, even if it did enter into a cost-benefit analysis. 

My reasoning for holding this belief is that:

1) NATO's expansion was not carried out actively or with aggressive intentions, but was a passive process of allowing countries in central and eastern Europe to join, due to their own security concerns. It is unlikely that the Kremlin could have seriously perceived this as a threat, since NATO is fundamentally not a war-mongering organisation, and would only ever engage in *retaliatory* combat.

2) Invading Ukraine would have been an idiotic - indeed nonsensical response, if it *was* a reaction to the NATO threat; and I don't think it's plausible that Putin and his advisors could have gotten it so wrong. Here's why it doesn't make sense:

* It always ran a significant risk of strengthening NATO (which it in fact has)
* Since the Crimea annexation, it has driven Ukraine further into the arms of the west (since they rightfully fear for their own security)
* A diplomatic approach to wooing Ukraine would have been feasible (since a majority of Ukrainians were against joining NATO prior to the Crimea annexation)
* Supposing Russia is successful in claiming Ukraine - this doesn't really help their security situation anyway; they are still directly adjacent to NATO countries.

A secondary belief, which you can engage with or not, is that the main driving force was Putin's personal desire for glory and respect, and to leave a Peter-the-Great-like legacy. I don't hold this view very strongly - so I'll also give deltas to anyone who can provide convincing arguments that it *is* correct.",CaptainQueero,479,0.7400000095367432,843,1695878942,2023-09-28 00:29:02,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16u7f78/cmv_the_expansion_of_nato_is_not_what_prompted/,9,2023

Israeli government accepts and declares independence. Palestine government rejects and declares war on Israel. Surrounding Arab countries: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria - declare war on Israel and invade both Israel and Palestine. 

Short version, the war ends with Jordan ruling the West Bank (most of modern day Palestine), Egypt ruling the Gaza strip (Southern Palestine where Hamas is ruling today), Israel surviving and leading an offensive campaign with territorial gains. 

Biggest losers of the war, and the reason for the crisis today: 750,000 Palestinians expelled, no more Palestine. 

Israel was fighting an existential war, so while I cannot justify the atrocities, I can imagine doing whatever is necessary to survive. But Egypt and Jordan were under no circumstances at risk of being invaded by Israel, yet they decided to take advantage of the war and expand into the two most significant areas of today's Palestine. 

The crazy thing is that both Egypt and Jordan made peace with Israel, but never took responsibility for what they did to the Palestinians in 1948.

Imagine a world where the Arab countries don't invade Israel/Palestine in 1948. Israel is not in existential war and can behave rationally.

16w65yu,"CMV: Gun violence in the United States will continue to increase, and there is nothing we can do.","My argument is basically a two-point case. I believe the following:

1. Gun control will never be passed in the United States at a federal level, which is the only way it could work, because otherwise someone truly determined to commit a mass shooting can just go to a neighboring state with more lax gun laws.
2. Even if gun control were passed on a federal level, it wouldn't work.

POINT 1: 

Look, it's no secret that the massacres keep happening more and more frequently. I tend to agree with that British journalist who said that Sandy Hook was the end of the gun control debate. Gun violence has gone from a generation-defining tragedy to something that happens every day in America. Events like Uvalde that remain in the news for a few weeks are the exception, not the rule. Plus, the general public seems to care less and less about the fact that the US is a total warzone. As an example, Greg Abbott, a very pro-gun violence politician, won 60 percent in the vote in Uvalde County even after the Robb Elementary massacre. Other countries have started putting travel warnings against the US, and still nothing ever changes even as our foreign relations suffer. I don't have any serious expectation that things will change enough for gun control to be passed federally. However, that's not even the biggest obstacle to putting an end to this plague.

POINT 2:

To those who would say that other countries have solved this problem, I'm not going to deny that. However, Canada, Australia, Germany, and other countries never had the same gun culture that we did. The US has twice as many guns per capita as fucking YEMEN. If gun control were passed tomorrow, I expect gun sales to massively increase the way they do after every high-profile mass shooting. The Second Amendment people will say ""They're trying to take our guns!"" and they'll arm up even further. Even if that doesn't happen, there are still too many guns floating around, so the only real solution is for the government to forcibly confiscate them, which would probably end in even more violence. *Even in the best-case scenario, gun violence would continue, it just wouldn't increase as exponentially as it is right now.* 

As you can imagine, I desperately want my view changed, because I don't want to believe that I have to move to another country. I just hate seeing the US devolve into a civil warzone.

16waaqx,"CMV: The (subset of) Christians who claim that Hell is eternal torment do not, in fact, actually believe it - given how lackadaisical they are about it.","First off, I recognize that not all Christians claim that Hell is eternal torment. Some claim the afterlife for unsaved people is annihilationism, some claim it's purgatory, some claim something else altogether.

That being said, in the religious circle that I grew up in (charismatic and Baptist-type denominations,) this was by and large the default viewpoint that was preached from the pulpit - that those who die unsaved will burn in Hell. I attended a Christian college that required all students to agree with their 'statement of faith' which included a section that stated that those who die unsaved are in ""conscious torment for eternity."" And this viewpoint isn't rare at all; I'd wager that many millions of Christians - in America and elsewhere in the world - claim to ascribe to such an interpretation.

What always struck me as particularly hollow about this claim, though, was that **hardly a single Christian behaved as if this was real.**

Think about what the implications would be if Hell were *really* that - being tortured for eternity. It would mean something far *worse*, and *longer*, than being tortured for 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. Think about the agony that people in the World Trade Center who were in the inferno-vicinity of the jet-impact points suffered - for probably no more than a few minutes - as they were roasted alive in the flames on 9/11. Or think of the people who were immersed into vats of nitric acid by ISIS, or skinned alive in some ancient societies, or who burned alive in the firebombing of Dresden or Tokyo, or - well, really, the most horrific physical fate or gruesome torture you can think of. 

Now multiply that length of torture/suffering by *trillions* of years, and you haven't even gotten *close* to the length of time Hell is (according to such theology.)

Now, most such Christians don't believe in universalism either (the belief that all will be saved.) Indeed, it is a very common view of many Christians that relatively *few* people will be saved (they often cite the verse where Jesus says, ""Wide is the path to destruction, and many find it; narrow is the path to life, and few find it."") Let's say that ""few"" means 10%, and even that's considered generous by many such Christians. This means that 90% of the world's population is going to Hell - forever - the most horrific torment. And what this also means, is that **94 people in the world are going to Hell every single minute,** given the number of people in the world who die per minute. It also means your unsaved cousin, boyfriends, classmate at school, uncle, coworker, friendly neighbor, etc. are all at imminent risk of falling into torture that goes on forever and forever. I mean, all it takes is for a drunk driver to hit them at an intersection one day, or a heart attack. (Again, I don't believe this - I'm just saying, that's what many Christians **claim** to be true.)

But - *the vast majority of such Christians spend perhaps no more than half an hour every year in evangelism.* They live their lives as if people are **not** going to, in fact, be roasted, shrieking and screaming, in flames forever. They spend 99.99% of their time watching TV, working, having hobbies, fun, traveling, reading, etc. - like anyone else - as if they're totally chill and fine with the prospect of 270 out of their 300 friends on Facebook being sentenced to a fate so terrible that it's barely humanly imaginable. Sure, you see the occasional street preacher who shouts with a loudspeaker ""Turn and burn, you are all headed to Hell!"" - but that's the rare exception.

So, the only conclusion I can draw from such behavior is that over 99% of Christians who claim that Hell means horrific torment for all eternity do not, in fact, actually believe their own theology.

16wf0c3,CMV: Credit checks should not lower your credit score,"As far as I know, soft credit checks are when you check your own credit score. These are not punished. Hard credit checks are when creditors check it when you're applying for something. This is absolute horse shit. The only way to really know what interest rate you're going to get is when the creditor runs a hard credit check. So if you want to be cautious and responsible by only applying for a loan/credit which you can afford, you get punished for checking it. Especially if various creditors offer different rates and you want to check with all of them. The idea of getting punished for being responsible is dumb. 

While we're at it, paying off a loan early should not negatively impact someone's credit score either. Being responsible and paying off high interest loans should not be viewed as a negative.

Change my view. Tell me why exactly it's a good thing to punish people for hard credit checks and paying loans off early. I understand that it's setup for the creditors to profit, not the consumers. I want to understand the bullshit justification used for it.

I got permission from mods for a repost\]  
I dont even know where to start. I decided to make this post because school has started again and I often see people my age and even younger kissing and dating and it upsets me so much. and I dont have anyone to turn to and ask for advice.  
I am 16 years old and havent even kissed a girl yet. I know people say i am too young to worry about that but im sick of it. so many people have sex and date in their teens when they are around my age and when they are even younger. the average age here in the UK is just 16!  
and people all over other places like the usa also have sex and date and it just kills me to know that so many people are easily able to experience what I struggle with so much.  
I fucking hate it when family members, friends, and coworkers ask about who im dating. i hate it so much. I overheard 2 women in a store talk about their sons and one of them said their 13 year old son is a big boy and already has a girlfriend. fuck that just made me seethe so much with envy.  
I have discovered the incel movement and couldnt help but sympathize with them. and I dont mean the psychopathic murderous things. I dont wish harm on anyone.  
Women/girls are the choosers and they always seem to choose some of the douchiest, stupidest, biggest fucking losers and its hard to respect women because of it. its why i have grown to resent them. Some of the girls i have known have cried and complained to their friends how their boyfriend left them, cheated, or doesnt give them much attention. girls for some reason, always seem to go for the brutes that really dont care about them.  
and I wanna make it clear I do not think I am entitled to anything (gosh i despise it when people just throw that word at us). I just feel envious and perplexed at how guys, including some of biggest jerks, easily get girlfriends while i am stuck with my hand and virtual girls. it feels so pathetic.  
I hate having desires to kiss and date girls. if i could turn gay or get rid of these desires i would in an instant. so many guys seem to take it for granted. it seems amazing to be able to hold hands, kiss, and even have sex with girls. girls are just pretty.  
There was this senior girl I had a HUGE crush on. When I walked past her I heard her talking with a friend about her having sex with a guy at her house and how he said he loved her neck.  
I later found out it was this fucking nerdy looking freshman. I saw them kissing outside of school and then I found out she slept with other guys. Before graduation, I planned to ask her out or try to flirt with her and I did but guess what? she fucking rejected me.  
The dudes she slept with werent even anything special. They werent in some band, or in the sports team, nor were they talented or rich.  
yet this fucking loose, shameless, disgraceful, skank of a whore still chose to have sex with these absolute losers.  
as much as i wanna have sex with one, I would happy with just kissing and dating. some of the things i wanna do is take a girl out to a very fun place like a bowling alley, zoo, a carnival, or an aquarium and see sharks and sea lions or even take her to eat ice cream with me at a park. i wanna have fun and live a normal teenage life but i cant because the universe seems to fucking cuck me so much. Girls seem so dirty and horny as guys yet none of them are ever interested in me. NONE. its like im destined to stay single and a virgin.  
not only do i feel pathetic and less of a man and human being in general for not being able to do what billions of people have done and what millions of people, including teens are doing as we speak, but i feel like theres such a void in me that i cant fill. i just wanna cuddle and kiss with a girl who likes me back but none of them do.  
i dont wanna date and have sex when im older. it seems boring and much less fun because you have much less free time and grownups seem so miserable all the time. i wanna do it now that im still young and have lots of free time and energy.  
Plus, I know that not ALL girls are shallow or like toxic assholes. but the ones that dont are always taken. all the good, smart, beautiful girls always have boyfriends.",_Furry_Potato_,645,0.6600000262260437,1055,1696102207,2023-09-30 14:30:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16wfk2f/cmv_i_am_a_16_year_old_incel_who_believes_he_will/,9,2023
16wg0hb,CMV: Unpaid internships should be illegal,"The most obvious reason that unpaid internships should be illegal is because this violates the spirit of minimum wage laws, if not the letter. People should be paid for their work.

The other reason is that unpaid internships exacerbate inequality by offering people with no experience a way to gain a foothold in a given industry only if they can survive for the length of the internship without earning any money. 

For people who need to work so they can survive, an unpaid internship is usually not an option. And so these people are often caught in the catch-22 situation of needing experience so they can get a job, and needing a job so they can get experience.

If companies paid interns at least minimum wage, this would level the playing field considerably and enable more working-class people to gain experience in their chosen field.

To change my view, you would have to convince me either that unpaid internships do not exacerbate or perpetuate inequality, or that it is reasonable for a company to not pay a person for their work.",LaserWerewolf,349,0.8799999952316284,280,1696103333,2023-09-30 14:48:53,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16wg0hb/cmv_unpaid_internships_should_be_illegal/,9,2023

* Most good jobs require a college degree

* Most people go to college with the intent to get a higher paying job than would otherwise be available 

* Most people do not have enough generational wealth to make a family or have a comfortable standard of living without a good job

* Many people would opt out of college altogether if not for the fact that many jobs require a degree, even if someone without a degree could do the job well

16y3qhp,"CMV: Conservatives decide which viewpoint to hold on an issue by first checking to see which stance liberals are holding, and then automatically opposing it.","This sort of viewpoint is impossible to prove, given that there are no surveys or polling on the issue (and even if there were, there's no way to get people to respond honestly,) so it's simply my hunch, and I'm open to people changing my mind on it.

There are many issues in politics today - particularly Ukraine and Covid - on which it's pretty clear that the only, or main, reason that conservatives are opposing Thing XYZ is simply because they see liberals supporting Thing XYZ.

Let's use Covid first. At the beginning of the Covid pandemic, many conservatives actually went along with the pandemic protocols, and America actually saw a brief dip in infections (this is around the March 2020 time.) That's because Covid hadn't become ""politically sorted out yet."" 

But as time went on, and mask-wearing and social distancing became seen as a ""liberal"" thing to do, conservatives thought, ""Okay, now that libs are doing it, we have to start opposing it, otherwise we wouldn't be conservatives"" and so they started opposing vaccines, masks, distancing - for no good reason other than that libs were doing it and they felt ""If Team Blue does it, then Team Red must oppose it."" There was no **inherent** reason why conservatives should assist a virus' spread and see America suffer heavy death tolls, other than that the libs were fighting against the virus. 

Same with Ukraine. Republican support for Ukraine was actually quite strong at first, around March 2022. But as time went on, and supporting Ukraine became seen as a ""Democratic"" thing to do, conservatives began opposing it. Bear in mind, again, that there's no **inherent** reason why conservatives should oppose helping Ukraine - not only was the cost of doing so extremely cheap, but historically, opposing Russia has been the Republican stance - just look at Ronald Reagan, the ""The-Soviet-Union-is-an-Evil-Empire"" president. So, again, with Ukraine, it was a case of conservatives watching liberals supporting Ukraine and thinking, ""Hmmm, if they support it, we must oppose it.""

I'd even go so far as to say that **if liberals had opposed Covid anti-virus measures and opposed helping Ukraine, that conservatives would then, reflexively, have supported those anti-virus measures and supported Ukraine - out of sheer opposition to Team Blue.**

So, that's the stance I am trying to get changed - that many (but not all) conservatives today, especially the Marjorie Taylor-Greene type, are not basing their stance off of any true principle or pillar of reason, but rather, simply because they automatically oppose whatever Team Blue supports - even if Team Blue is supporting something that's **good**.

16z86yq,"CMV: I'm extremely suspicious of anyone who opts to homeschool their kids, and really don't think there are many legitimate reasons to do it.","I have seen studies suggesting that home-schooled kids perform better in certain academic fields when compared to non-homeschooled kids. What I haven't seen is a study that indexes this to income, or to two-parent households. Both of those have profound impacts on the likelihood of academic success, and most homeschooling situations require either a very comfortable income, a two-parent household, or both. 

I'm highly doubtful that your average homeschooled child is performing significantly better than if they were in a regular school with parents who took an active interest in their education. 

Meanwhile, I have serious trouble grappling with the impact that this level of isolation and enmeshment might have. I can't help but feel, based on the homeschooling situations I've seen that it leaves kids less fulfilled or socially mature. 

The majority of homeschooling I've seen has been for religious reasons. Now, I attended 13 years of faith-based education. I'm not *entirely* against integrating religious instruction into education on principle, provided it doesn't impede on a child's understanding of basic facts. I *mostly* am, but given it's long history and integration with many education systems I'm more comfortable. 

However, I find it ***especially*** suspicious when your faith leads to that degree of isolation and inordinate levels of control over your child.

As Joe Biden and Donald Trump are signifcant favourites to lead both their respective parties into the 2024 election. So I think it's fair to say that the 2024 US election will be contested between these 2 candidates. I know Trump is going through some legal issues, but knowing rich, white billionaires, he'll probably be ok to run in 2024  
  
Reading online forums and news posts has led me to believe that a signifcant portion of those who voted for Biden in 2020, and will vote for him again 2024 aren't doing so because they like him and his policies, but rather, they are doing so because they do not support Donald Trump, or any GOP nomination.  
  
I have a couple of reasons for believing this. Of course as it is the nature of the sub. I am open to having these reasons challenged  
  
\-Nearly every time voting for Third Parties is mentioned on subs like r/politics, you see several comments along the lines of ""Voting Third Party will only ensure Trump wins."" This seems to be a prevailing opinion among many Democrats, and Biden supporters. I believe that this mentality is what spurs many left wingers and centrists who do NOT support Biden into voting for him. As they are convincted that voting for their preferred option could bolster Trump  
  
\-A Pew Research poll (link: https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/election-2020-voters-are-highly-engaged-but-nearly-half-expect-to-have-difficulties-voting/?utm\_content=buffer52a93&utm\_medium=social&utm\_source=twitter.com&utm\_campaign=buffer ) suggets up to 56% of Biden voters are simply voting for him because they don't want Trump in office. It's possible to suggest this is a mood felt among a similar portion of Biden voters, but then again, the poll only had \~2,000 responses. Regardless, I seem to get the feeling that a lot of Biden's supporters are almost voting out of spite for Trump and the GOP.

How can a President gain 270 electoral votes and the majority of the population's support when he struggles to gain 40%+ in approval ratings. For me, this is a clear sign of many people just choosing him not because they like Biden, but because they just don't want the GOP alternative.

172d6zf,CMV: The Israelis - and most people - would behave just like the Palestinians if they were in their shoes.,"The whole Israel-Palestine issue could fill 400 pages; it's one of the thorniest and most complicated political-religious-historical issues in the world. I am not going to pretend that my 400-word post here can do it justice, and I'll preface by saying that anything I post here is, out of necessity, going to have to be gross oversimplification:

 The Israelis frequently condemn the Palestinian side (such as the current ongoing Hamas attack) for terrorist attacks and whatnot - unsurprisingly so, given that Israel is their side (just like how America, of course, condemned the 9/11 attacks.) **But I am not convinced that, if the roles were reversed, that the Israelis would be behaving any differently.**

Say that Israel were squelched and prevented from being a formally-recognized nation state on terms that it wanted (yes, the Palestinians have been offered two-state solutions, but none that they found satisfactory), and also that it was facing continuous blockade, in poverty, were under the control of a much bigger, stronger, richer opponent of the opposing religion, and that this went on for decades with no end in sight. 

I don't believe, for one moment, that the Israelis would say ""Well, we'll just be content and stay like this forever and always pursue peaceful solutions even though we've found that peace gets us nothing."" The Israelis would be doing something just like what Gaza Hamas is doing right now. **And in fact, that's similar to what Israel did, in fact, do. The Lehi (Stern Gang) used terrorist attacks to help get the nation of Israel formed in the first place, back in the 1940s.**

So the viewpoint I am trying to get changed is this: If the Israelis were in the shoes of the Palestinians, they'd behave the same. And in fact, most people in the world would, too.",SteadfastEnd,1162,0.7099999785423279,1734,1696703137,2023-10-07 13:25:37,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/172d6zf/cmv_the_israelis_and_most_people_would_behave/,10,2023
172zudm,CMV: Voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all.,"In 2020, only about 2/3 of eligible voters actually voted. According to a survey, of the 1/3 who did not vote, 20% said their reason for not voting was that they did not like the candidates.  
https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/945031391/poll-despite-record-turnout-80-million-americans-didnt-vote-heres-why  
Here is my view: If you do not like either of the main two candidates enough to vote for one of them, you might as well vote for someone else.  
A lot of people say ""a vote for a 3rd party candidate is a vote for (insert name of Democrat or Republican candidate)""  
By definition it is not. It is a vote for someone else. And this argument fails even harder when the voter in question would not otherwise have voted for anyone.  
People say that voting for a 3rd party candidate is meaningless because they won't win. But something interesting happens when a 3rd party candidate gets 5% of the vote. They become eligible for federal funding in the next election.  
https://transition.fec.gov/info/chtwo.htm  
This is certainly not impossible. In 2016, both Clinton and Trump were such immensely terrible candidates that the Libertarian nominee, Gary Johnson, got 3.3% of the vote.  
It's too early to say for sure, but I'd wager both major candidates in 2020 will be astonishingly difficult to vote for.  
So if a potential voter's reaction to whichever two clowns they put at the top of the ballot is to vote for neither of them... why shouldn't they vote for someone else instead?  
This is not to say that an undecided voter should necessarily vote 3rd party instead of trying to figure out which of the major candidates is the 'lesser evil'. My statement is only that voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all.  
In an ironic twist, due to the way the electoral college works, in deep red or deep blue states, voting for a 3rd party candidate may influence the result of the election more profoundly than voting for one of the two main candidates. One vote can be the difference between a major party receiving 88% or 88.0001% of the vote in a particular state... or it can be the difference between a third party receiving 4.99999999% or 5% of the vote nationwide.",LaserWerewolf,433,0.7799999713897705,631,1696773607,2023-10-08 09:00:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/172zudm/cmv_voting_for_a_3rd_party_candidate_is_more/,10,2023
173bl6u,"CMV: If there is a God, it's unfair for Him to sentence unbelievers to Hell as punishment when there are 4,000 religions in the world and it's impossible for someone to discern which one is correct.","Disclaimer: I'm only familiar with Christianity, and have some vague understanding of the other two Abrahamic religions (Islam and Judaism.) I know almost nothing about any other religion. So I cannot give adequate coverage of the other religions, all the more so given that 4,000 religions exist. I can only paint with a broad brush.

One central teaching of Christianity is that those who die unsaved will be suffer in Hell as their rightful outcome for not believing in Jesus as Lord and Savior. (Now, of course, many Christian denominations have different interpretations, but that's the overall gist of it.) 

And one argument that many Christians use is, ""God has made His existence clear and obvious to all, along with salvation, so we have no excuse on the day of Judgment.""

Indeed, a Bible verse, Romans 1:20, even says that explicitly: ""People are **without excuse** (for not believing in and knowing God.)""

Islam says similar things; that hell awaits the unbelievers.

The problem with all this, of course, is that 1) even if God exists, His existence is not obvious at all - the very fact that mankind has been debating His existence for millennia proves that it's not obvious - and 2) there are thousands of religions in the world. How are we supposed to know which one is correct?

To add a third point, **what religion one believes in is heavily influenced by geography and one's local culture.** If you were born in Iraq, you're almost certainly going to be a Muslim; if you were born in the Bible Belt in the USA, chances are you'll be a Christian, if you were born in Thailand, you'll likely be Buddhist, if you were born in India, you'll likely be Hindu, etc. So how is someone who was born in Iraq supposed to correctly ""deduce"" that Jesus is the one true Lord any more than someone born in Oklahoma or Alabama is supposed to think that Allah is god?

So the viewpoint I would be open to being changed is this: T**here isn't sufficient evidence for any one religion - out of 4,000 - to clearly and obviously stand out as the correct one - if religion is even the correct way to go at all (how do we know atheism isn't the right path?) And as such, it is unfair for God to throw someone into Hell for not drawing the correct religion-lottery number - correctly choosing the one out of 4,000.**

174rns9,CMV: Exercise ought to be encouraged to the same extent that personal hygiene is.,"Personal hygiene is something almost all of us are taught from a young age- things like brushing your teeth, washing your hair, taking showers, trimming nails, etc. We encourage these behaviors not only because of aesthetic and social benefits (i.e. smell better, look cleaner, so on) but also because they play a huge preventative role against diseases and deterioration of our bodies. If we stopped brushing our teeth, we would likely develop plaque or gum disease. If we stopped showering, we would begin to stink and accumulate dirt, grime, and bacteria on our bodies. 

As a society, we tend to encourage these behaviors fairly regularly, and often shun those who avoid these behaviors, and while I’m not trying to encourage bullying, I think this type of social correction is important to keep people clean and healthy.

However when it comes to exercise, the attitude seems to be a lot more focused on doing what you feel like as an individual; if you want to work out that’s cool but it’s totally acceptable if you don’t. This is the point I think needs to be adjusted.

Exercise is just as critical for health and appearance as hygiene is, with a sedentary lifestyle being just as bad as smoking, if not worse, when it comes to increasing the risk factor for debilitating and chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, cancers, and even depression. It also has the secondary benefit of increasing confidence and making a person look nicer.

Now I don’t want to suggest that everyone should become a bodybuilder, or work out with the intention of being a skinny legend, but we as a society ought to encourage and promote exercise to the same extent as hygiene, if not more. There are so many types of physical activity, many of which are available at no cost other than a little time (30 minutes a day or every other day) and little to no cost. 

I feel like the carefree attitude many have with their bodies and physical fitness is harmful as it normalizes sedentary habits instead of encouraging everyone to be active in whatever way they can.",ifitisntconnor,533,0.9200000166893004,151,1696960919,2023-10-10 13:01:59,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/174rns9/cmv_exercise_ought_to_be_encouraged_to_the_same/,10,2023
174rx2t,"CMV: If your child is going to be permanently disabled, it is selfish to have it","
I’ve noticed several posts on social media lately about parents with disabled children. These children have significant disabilities and will essentially require care throughout their lives.

Most of these posts present the situation from the parents' perspective. They often mention that they were aware their child would have a disability, but they didn't see it as a limitation. They express their commitment to provide their child with as much love and care as necessary to enable a life as normal as possible.

However, these posts rarely discuss the child’s perspective. Having experienced chronic illness myself and spoken to others in similar situations, I understand that while life may be challenging for the average individual, it's exponentially tougher for someone chronically ill. It's a continuous emotional and financial burden. There's a profound quote by Confucius that encapsulates this sentiment:

""A healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one.""

If you're considering having children but know they will be born with a disability, please consider other options.

They’re all just lying to them selves to avoid any type of responsibility. 

1. There are plenty of problems associated with being fat, being obsese or even overweight increased risk if health problem. There’s nothing more to it. You may not have problems at 20 or 30, but it’ll all go downhill eventually.
2. No, you aren’t oppressed. You made the choices to eat the amount of food you did to get to your size. If you don’t fit in a plane seat, or don’t meet the weight requirements for an activity, no one is required to accommodate you. You get to deal with the consequences.
3. Genetics don’t play that big of a role. Even with PCOS and Endometriosis, it is still possible to lose weight in a healthy way.
4. Calorie counting and a deficit does not mean an eating disorder. There is a safe and PROVEN way to lose weight, a calorie deficit, eating less (while still eating enough, not starving yourself)

Weight loss is completely possible and simple. It may not be easy as it takes will power, but it is possible.

176cb77,CMV: CEOs are not special talents that deserve tens of millions,"I was reading another thread that made some pretty good points about a CEOs value, but they only barely seem to hold up due to circumstance, and I hope there's more to it.

People wrote that top CEOs are tireless workers, who dedicate their entire life to the success of an entity. That may be true, but tons of regular people do this. One huge example are the millions of poor families that have individuals who sacrifice most of their waking hours to ensure some quality of life for their dependents. This behavior is not even minimally unique to top CEOs. Furthermore, executive positions rarely have any meaningful personal financial stakes, or otherwise (they already made it). The main reason for their absurd pay, appears to be because they are allowed to dictate it, and that societies prioritize shareholders over laborers. If laborers were protected and prioritized, it would be seemingly impossible to justify an absurd CEO salary.

I have also read that CEOs successfully manage tons of important relationships, and have to make enormous decisions every day. This is also not unique to top CEOs. Again, I will use a common example with higher personal stakes, which are working poor families. The working poor often have to succesfully deal with tons of people who have power over THEM (often sociopaths), under the threat of homelessness, daily. Their decisions and sacrifices are what make every difference for them and their families. CEOs have entire teams dedicated to making their decisions easier. The important relationships that CEOs manage are likely people with mutual interests, from the same absurd social class (low personal stakes in terms of financial security), which is hardly the most testing thing one can imagine.

Another thing I read is that CEOs tie together a lot of expertise from different departments. This is also not unique and even less special, in light of the people who manage the actual products and projects that truly define the success of a large company. In a large company, the departments must surely be connected by much more than an individual. A large successful company always looks more likely to succeed in spite of an owner, or CEO (Twitter), than it is to be helped in any way that isn't hollow, or related to perceptions. The stock market is seemingly ruled in large part by perception, and the directive is already built in, which is to make more money and cut costs. The CEO would be the friendly face that they know, and who makes the investors feel better. Someone who will pull the trigger on those nasty directives, and look good doing it, but not much more. If that's most of it, how does the position deserve 400 percent more than anybody?

I feel like the only reason this absurdity thrives, is the stock market. A market which is largely incoherent, needing regulation, and way too big to fail. The modern CEO seems to be the clown steward of our system's broken promises, and a vestige of our monotheistic worldview, but not some special genius.

I would love to know of any reason that a CEOs vast inequality makes sense, outside of a greedy/emotional stock market, and the directive for infinite growth that apparently needs a friendly/confident face to execute it. They really do seem to me to just be a bad person, that can market themselves as a good person, and push some dark directives, while only concerning themselves with initiatives that support those directives. It would be nice not to feel that shitty about all of it.

Another example that was used in the other thread was Messi, the soccer player, getting paid much more than others. But Messi represents labor and the object of consumption, not administration, so that doesn't work.",bohrmachine,1236,0.8299999833106995,701,1697131293,2023-10-12 12:21:33,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176cb77/cmv_ceos_are_not_special_talents_that_deserve/,10,2023
17810uj,"CMV: ""It wasn't real communism"" is a fair stance","We all know exactly what I am talking about. In virtually any discussion about communism or socialism, those defending communism will hit you with the classic ""not real communism"" defense. 

**While I myself am opposed to communism,** I do think that this argument is valid.

It is simply true that none of the societies which labelled themselves as communist ever achieved a society which was classless, stateless, and free of currency. Most didn't even achieve socialism (which we can generally define as the workers controlling the means of production).

I acknowledge that the meaning of words change over time, but I don't see how this applies here, as communism was defined by theory, not observance, so it doesn't follow that observance would change theory. 

It's as if I said: Here is the blueprint for my ultimate dreamhouse, and then I tried to build my dreamhouse with my bare hands and a singular hammer which resulted in an outcome that was not my ultimate dreamhouse. 

You wouldn't look at my blueprint and critique it based on my poor attempt, you would simply criticize my poor attempt.

I think this distinction is very important, because people stand to gain from having a well-rounded understanding of history, human behavior, and politics. And because I think that Marx's philosophy and method of critical analysis was valuable and extremely detailed, and this gets overlooked because people associate him with things that were not in line with his views.

17925sm,"CMV: If Palestine was ""free"" it would be a ethno-fascist hellscape, and a single-state solution is only marginally better","When you ask, fundamentally, what the hordes of people in the west protesting against Israel really want for the region,  most will, when pressed, eventually acknowledge they dont actually want their public demand of a two state solution along 1967 borders with land swaps.   This is actually pretty explicit from the ubiquitous protest chant ""From the River \[Jordan\] to the Sea \[Med\], Palestine must be free"", which clearly requires the conception of Israel to cease to be.

So what they are really arguing for is a single state solution.    Let's be incredibly generous and give them the benefit of the doubt and suggest that the single state is created without genocide, and protects both Jews and Muslims (and Christians, Atheists, even, gasp, apostates) equally.   What happens? 

Well, since the 650-700k Palestinians left their homes in what was the Mandate of Palestine (at least partly at the urging of the Arab state neighbours massing troops on the borders in anticipation of invasion), a lot of time has past and now there's upwards of 6m+ refugees and their descendants (fun fact, when counting Palestinian refugees for official purposes only patrilineal descendants count- score 1 for the patriarchy!  Possibly a further 2-3m more people can claim descendance from Palestinian refugee antecedents).

Assuming a decent proportion of this number exercised a right to return or a right to citizenship, combined with existing populations in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israeli Muslims, would give the new unitary Levant state a significant Muslim majority.

But what would that population be like?   Well, polling of Palestinian refugees is pretty clear on what they would vote for - hardline Islamists, most likely full jihadis.   The charter of Hamas (approval rate: 60%) expressly calls for driving the Jews into the sea, and half of Gazans actively support this goal.  Several more extreme groups have higher approval rates (Lion's Den: 75%)

In a two state solution, its obvious that the Palestinian state would elect a government extremely hostile to their Jewish neighbour.  Anyone who says different is deluded; their argument usually goes ""Palestinian hostility to Israel is Israels fault - if the occupation ended they'd have no reason to continue to be hostile"".   This ignores how Jews are treated in the world's Muslim majority states. Try being an apostate or Jew in Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.   Even Turkey.   It's hard to imagine a Palestinian state, whose population would be in large less educated, more hardline, poorer and more religious than those of any of those states, would somehow fulfil the progressive wet dreams of the pro-palestine protesters.  Much more likely any Palestinian state would be fun by violent religious extremists that make the Taliban look liberal.   Women would not be educated,  Polygamy (which is legal in Gaza) and corporal punishment would be commonplace. Apostasy would be punished by death (as it is expressly in 9 other Muslim majority states).   Borders with Israel would need to remain locked down to avoid constant violent clashes.  Travel between Gaza and the West Bank would have to remain extremely tightly proscribed (unless someone builds a tunnel!)

In a single state solution, you import all these problems into a state which needs to represent the interests of two utterly dissimilar populations.   It's hard to imagine how this would work, perhaps some kind of strictly enforced apportioned (but not proportionate) representation, constitutional safeguards with supermajority requirements etc..  Even then, it's likely there would be distinct local government (perhaps a federated republic?) of different Jewish and Palestinian areas of the state, and this is where things would get sticky.    Would the federal state be able to mandate Israeli-style anti discrimination laws, e.g. based on gender,  or for example outlawing Polygamy, when this is a normal part of life for many Palestinians?   How would Shariah law, which Palestinians are governed by, interact with this Federal law?   

Ultimately as Palestinians who have emigrated return en masse and (due also to much higher birth rates), the small Muslim majority in the unitary state would become an overwhelming one.  Constitutional safeguards are suddenly increasingly under threat and federal politics will remain deadlocked between two totally mis-aligned factions.  Pressure to take from the wealthy former-Israelis and give to the poor former-Palestinians would be overwhelming.  Public conflict between sectarian groups would be inevitable.   Under these conditions, its hard to imagine the state's safeguards remaining intact.  Likely, civil society would break down.

There are no easy answers, but I've yet to hear a cohesive vision from anyone that sounds like something any Israeli should support, even if they also want (rightly!) an end to all illegal settlement in the West Bank and the deplorable conditions in Gaza.",FFIFISISHFISHFISH,912,0.6499999761581421,1456,1697449227,2023-10-16 04:40:27,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17925sm/cmv_if_palestine_was_free_it_would_be_a/,10,2023
179e0bf,"CMV: Israel over decades has shown its willingness give back land for peace. In turn, there cannot be peace until Palestinians accept that Israel isn't going anywhere and are willing to make compromises.","The Palestinians have been offered statehood multiple times and have rejected it everytime because the deal wasn't 100% to their liking. In 1948, they said no. In 1967 Israel offered all of the land it won in war back in exchange for peace, the answer from Arab countries was a resounding ""NO."" Then you have Arafat leading everyone on and then rejecting a reasonable peace offer from Israel.

Eventually you have to wonder if statehood is the goal or something else.

At a certain point, Palestinians will have to recognize that Israel isn't going anywhere and if their ultimate objective is statehood, there has to be some compromise. Israel gave back the entirety of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for peace, a wildly controversial and unpopular move at the time. 

When Israel left Gaza in 2005, it forcibly removed Israeli citizens to let Gazans govern themselves.

 When the goal is great (peace, or statehood), hard and tough decisions must be made. Compromise must be made. After WW2, the Germans lost parts of historic Germany. Like it or not, for peace to exist, when one party starts a war and then loses, they lose leverage and negotiating power and must make compromises if peace is truly the goal. It's been that way throughout history.

Palestinians need to let go of the notion that resistance means the eradication of Israel and that generations of refugees can return. It's simply a fairytale dream at this point. Too many Palestinians, in my opinion, have been brainwashed to believe that this is a feasible outcome -- hence the celebration/support for any and all type of resistance, no matter how gruesome and inhumane.

Meanwhile, in the current conflict, I've yet to see a reasonable answer as to what Israel should do instead of attacking Hamas? What other country would allow another entity to break through, murder over 1000 civillians, and then take back over 150 hostages? If the line hasn't been crossed now, then how many more massacres will be needed before people realize that Hamas' stated goal is to destroy Israel?

What is a proportional response to an entity like Hamas who's objective is to eliminate Israel entirely? Am geniunely curious if there is an alternative to war because I sure hope there is.

179ey04,CMV: You shouldn’t go to Reddit for relationship advice,"I believe there are two good sources of relationship advice: close friends and trained couples counselors. Getting advice from a stranger with no qualifications, speaking based on a few paragraphs of text, is more likely to hurt than to help. 

About the qualifications, I think that even if a layman is in a healthy relationship, they are probably not aware of what makes the relationship healthy. It’s better to get advice from someone who can draw from the world’s collective, rigorously tested understanding of how relationships work, i.e. relationship science. 

Aside from professionals, close friends could be a good resource because they have intimate and extensive context about you and/or your partner. A brief description of your relationship gives nothing close to that understanding. Redditors are bound to make wrong assumptions about your relationship in addition to probably having wrong ideas about relationships in general.

Personally, my girlfriend [22F] and I [23M] have both used Reddit for advice about our relationship of almost two years. Neither of us has been in a relationship before. Every time I’ve posted people have told me that either I’m a bad person or she is, or that we’re just not compatible and should break up.

17a59kt,"CMV: hating children as a whole is weird, evil, and sociopathic.","As someone who is currently childfree (I'm 23 and I don't plan on having children for at LEAST 6-7 years), and as someone who knows people who are permanently childfree for a variety of reasons, I believe that people - childfree or otherwise - who proclaim to **hate** children have sociopathic tendencies. In my opinion, it's one thing to be staunchly child free and to not be good with kids, even to not necessarily want to or prefer to be around kids for extended periods of time. But to me, it is very concerning and indicative of someone's character if they claim to downright hate children and if they are wishing harm to children, even in a so-called ""joking"" manner. Children are children for a reason - they are defenseless minor members of our society and it's a spoken and unspoken societal requirement for us to protect and subsidize them. 

Practical things aside, every one of us were a child at one point in the past, and many of us don't like to remember or acknowledge the period in our lives when we were quite literally novices to personhood and were trying to figure out how to exist as a human being in a space where the majority of the people around us are much older, taller, and wiser than us. And at a certain threshold, when we were *very* young children, we weren't even old enough to communicate our needs with words, which I'm sure is a very frustrating experience for many kids, if not all of them! I feel that to actively ignore this point about the experience of children is very misguided. 

Like, for those of us who have worked with children or been around kids for extended periods of time in some capacity, it can be VERY taxing and exhausting, and there are many kids who are downright bratty and insufferable. But the latter point is often the fault of the adult(s) in their lives, and to ascribe this feeling of genuine hatred and disdain toward the entirety of a literal protected class - a defenseless and dependent one at that - is very sinister to me and is indicative of either deep unresolved issues from one's own childhood or sociopathic tendencies.

17a6q26,CMV: There's nothing wrong with criticizing Islam,"My view concerns Islam specifically, because nobody seems to take issue with me criticizing any other religion. 

Islam is no better or worse than other religions and like other religions there is plenty that warrants criticism. Like the fact that several passages of the holy book either promote violence or have not been written clearly enough to stop people from interpreting them that way. 

But whenever somebody criticizes Islam today they're often accused of being Islamaphobic. Which is really, from the perspective of those who don't follow Islam just not liking the views of people who have been dead for centuries, which seems completely fine to me and not remotely racist unless somebody dislikes them because they were from the middle east. But the assumption is usually ""this person doesn't like POC."" 

Some people seem to believe that criticizing Islam will lead to hate towards Muslims, esp. Since they're already in the minority. I think the opposite is true- if you refuse to point out clear issues with a given religion and don't let anybody else do it either people start looking for those who will. And the people that they find are the actual threat. Whereas if you say ""this passage about lot's people is encouraging violence against gay people or not written very well so it causes some hardcore followers of Islam to kill gay people... It's no different than saying this passage in the bible about slavery is bad. I don't think saying a passage in the Bible is violent leads to violence against Christians, so why would criticizing a passage in the Quaran lead to violence against Muslims?",ICuriosityCatI,983,0.8899999856948853,903,1697571616,2023-10-17 14:40:16,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17a6q26/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_criticizing_islam/,10,2023

17blkjq,"CMV: Reddit should display both downvotes and upvotes on comments and posts, or at least the ration","Why is it that the way reddit currently displays comment scores shows only the net score (upvotes - downvotes)? This creates an unhealthy hivemind mentality where people pile on downvotes once a comment already has a negative score.  
Shouldn't it display both?  
Seeing only the net score makes a -100 comment look like everyone disagrees, even though the real counts could be 11,000 upvotes and 11,100 downvotes. That's still a very mixed opinion overall!  
Only showing net scores makes people scared to share minority opinions, since they'll assume no one agrees if the visible score is negative. This strengthens echo chambers and discourages healthy debate.Reddit should show both upvote and downvote counts, or at least show the ratio of upvote %.  
That would give a much more nuanced look at public opinion.For example, a score of -20 with a ratio of 45% would indicate a very divisive comment that some agree with. But the way it looks now, -20 appears like overwhelming disagreement.  
Showing both numbers would lead to less pile-on downvoting and more reasoned discussion. People would be more willing to express minority opinions knowing others agree. And seeing the upvote count might make some reconsider a downvote.Reddit already tracks both numbers internally.  
Making them visible would be an easy change to reduce hivemind mentality and echo chambers.

17buw71,CMV: Home births are dangerous selfish on the moms part,"Home births are selfish and dangerous on the moms part. My experience is anecdotal but I have known MANY women who have needed emergency care for their babies during labour and delivery and immediately afterwards in hospital, including my own. These babies would not have survived being born at home and some moms either. I’ve also known 3 people who attempted home births and all three ended up in emergency medical transfers. 
I know several paramedic friends who are all against home births. They have seen too many horror stories of things going wrong. Midwives treat paramedics like they are magical angels, but they are still bound by distance and time and the reality is they just can’t get to you or to the hospital fast enough. Also I recently called 911 for a medical emergency and was out on hold before speaking to them - on hold before even being triaged. I have zero faith that if I needed emergency care I would actually get it. 
Home birth has zero benefit to the baby. It is not healthier or safer in North America to give birth at home. It is only because mom wants the comfort of her own home. It doesn’t do anything to benefit baby it only puts baby ( and mom) at increase risks.

17bx7k4,CMV: Religious ethics have no place in policy making,"I reently had a discussion with a redditor right here in a post about critique towards islam. It quickly evolved in a discussian about ethics itself. The redditor said, that he believes that secular ethics are not really defendable and lack substance, since, without a god, there is nothing to stop yomeone from murdering everyone for the benefit of spreading their own genes. 

I hurled some secular ethical principles against him, and i am fairly sure, at the moment, that those are absolutly superior and more appliable towars almost every ethical problam that one can face, especially when deciding on laws and policies. 

I would go furhter and say i currently hold that believe that every law influenced by religion is inherently unjust towards the percentage of the population that does NOT hold the religious views that influenced that law. 

I personally get the impression that being religious is fine, and ordering your life according to religious rules is fine as long as those rules remain private and confined to your own life. Although i still believe that someone adhering to secular ethics because they WANT to be a good person seems like a better person to me (and safer) than someone only holding back on the mayhem because they are afraid of divine punishment (because there might be ways around drawing the deities ire, for example by targeting a group that is singled out as ""evil"" in a holy text)

17c4l2c,CMV: There's nothing political about young men who can't get laid,"You may think that the title of this post sounds a bit strange.  Let me explain. 

  
If you have ever read anything over at r/purplepilldebate, you’ll know that a lot of the young men posting there are complaining that they can’t find a girlfriend because, in their view, women make illogical and unjust decisions when choosing a romantic partner. This may or may not be true but I want to point out that I feel for these guys.  I was an “incel” myself back in the late 1990s before that term was coined and I was super frustrated.  But if think what’s going on here is that these young men are confusing their struggles to get laid with other past struggles against injustice that were more political in nature. 

  
Let’s take the civil rights struggle of African Americans or women’s lib or mainstream acceptance of LGTBQA.  In each case there were policy decisions that could be made to right the wrong: ending Jim Crow, removing barriers from women entering the workplace, legalizing same-sex marriages, etc.  And there were also efforts that could be made to change people’s attitudes about these oppressed groups: calling out cops for profiling black men, addressing rampant sexual harassment, not using homosexual pejoratives, etc. 

  
But in the case of young heterosexual men who can’t find a partner, there’s nothing to be done at the societal level.  Choosing a sexual partner is a highly subjective personal decision.  There’s nothing logical or fair about it.  Yes, people do sometimes choose horrible partners.  This is not a man thing or a woman thing or a gay thing or a straight thing.  It’s a human thing.  This is why there’s about 2000 years of poetry and music about heartache and loss. It’s a fundamental part of being a person.

    
And you can’t tell women that they must choose men who are under 5’7” because it’s not fair that they have a harder time dating anymore than you can tell a man that he has to date a woman who is 400 pounds.  It’s a person isn’t attracted to someone there’s really nothing to be done about it.    
Many will say, “but in the past men had a much easier time finding partners, and then feminists wrecked everything!”, or something like that.  This is nonsense.  Again, there’s nothing political about how dating works.  

  
American men are having a harder time dating these days because we live in a super affluent society with a mega abundance of choice.  This means that yes, if you use dating apps, women are going to be more picky because they can be.  Biological women, particularly in their early adulthood, have a lower sex drive than biological men.  If you put a bunch of photos of men in front of them, they are going to choose less of them to date than if you put a bunch of photos of women in front of men.  Sorry.  That’s just how it is. 

  
But technology is stacked against young men dating in other ways too.  Because of the internet, lots of horny young males spend hours and hours looking at porn or playing video games instead of going out and meeting people which would, you know, increase their chances of getting laid.  But that takes effort and it’s a little bit scary so it’s not hard to understand why so many are choosing instead to just stay home and masturbate.  

  
I really think it’s just that simple.  I feel kinda sorry for these guys but I don’t think there’s anything to be done about their plight at the societal level.  Anyone want to change my view?

17d53a0,CMV: People who don’t have kids will be worse off in old age,"I currently work in a nursing home and have some hospital experience from school and ever since I started this past year I’ve never  really realized how much older people without families struggle. 

Many older people develop serious health conditions and once you’re a senior if you don’t have a family of your own it’s a struggle. Most people in this group either have pets which obviously can’t take care of them or a group of friends, neighbours or extended family who is also old.  

At the nursing home I work with many patients without families are just rotting away here until they die, they don’t get adequate care and without family members these people often get poor treatment for years and have their health conditions exacerbated. It’s really just a cruel lonely existence, I actually feel better for patients with dementia because at least they aren’t aware of the state they are in. 

On top of this many patients in that group always tell me about how lonely they have gotten and their biggest regret often being not starting a family because after a certain point most social contacts lose touch or pass away.

17daxlg,CMV: The Confederate Flag is traitorous.,"I went to Franklin Tennesse (my first time in the ""South"") for 2 days and was surprised by the amount of Confederate flags I saw there. These people are the very people who consider themselves patriots committed to our nation, yet I see the Confederate flag as the biggest symbol of treason in American history. It is a symbol of secession and oppression of American citizens. The Confederacy was literally a group of traitorous Americans who opposed our great Constitution and wanted to separate themselves from the United States. It is also a symbol of defending slavery, but that's a whole other discussion. I have nothing but the utmost respect for our country and its Constitution, and see the Confederate flag as a symbol of direct opposition to these institutions. Man say the flag is a symbol of Southern heritage and identity. Shouldn't the beautiful stars and stripes of the American flag be a symbol of their heritage and identity? I just find it peculiar NO OTHER REGION in the US is committed to a symbol of their ""regional identity"" like the South is. I live in California, but nobody is saying ""fuck yeah we're the bear state!"" NOBODY! We don't particularly emphasize our state flag here, and I don't think any other region is like that either, whether it be the Midwest, Pacific Coast, New England, or the Middle Atlantic.

A point I'd like to bring up is why immigrants who display the flags of their mother country is not treasonous in comparison. The South has strong regional ties to the US. Many immigrants have strong regional ties to their home countries. Additionally, their flags (even the flags of Vietnam and Iran) are not inherently symbols of anti-Americanism, while the Confederate flag literally is.",RealFee1405,1826,0.8100000023841858,1935,1697918170,2023-10-21 14:56:10,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17daxlg/cmv_the_confederate_flag_is_traitorous/,10,2023
17du96r,CMV: Paternity tests should be done on every baby by default,"Just saw a post on r/relationship_advice where the mother gave birth to a baby that looked nothing like her husband, refused to give him a paternity test because it was ""humiliating"" AND also revealed that she had recently refused to end a (pretty weird) friendship with a coworker that her husband was uncomfortable with. She then proceeds to be all ""Surprised Pikachu-faced"" when he thinks she cheated on him with said coworker, refuses to help with the baby, and him and his family start treating her badly. (he continued to help with their 2 other kids as normal, though)

In the end, the mother FINALLY gets that paternity test, proving once and for all that the kid was indeed his, and once she does, the father gets ALL OVER his daughter, hugging and giving her all his love, as I'm sure he would have done from the very begining, had she just gotten that damn test done sooner.

Some of the points that resonate with me the most on this issue are:

* It still baffles me that this test isn't standard procedure, especially when we already draw blood from newborns and screen them for a whole slew of diseases upon delivery. Surely it wouldn't be too hard to add a simple paternity test to the list!
* I know there's an implication of mistrust that comes with asking your partner for a paternity test, but if it became standard procedure - in other words, a test that the hospital does ""automatically"", with no need for parental input - that would completely remove that implication from play. It would become a non-issue.
* Having a kid is a life-changing event, and it scares me to no end to know that I could be forced into ""one-eightying"" my life over a baby I actually played no part in making.
* Knowing your family's medical history, from both sides, is extremely important.

17dzdxk,CMV: It's not unreasonable to expect people who get cold easy to accommodate people who get hot easy,"So, there's this age-old battle between people who run cold and people who run hot. It sucks for anyone to be at an uncomfortable temperature, but, logically, it's the people who run hot who should be accommodated.

The options for improving comfort are very limited when you're overheated. A fan can help, but only so far, and there's only so much clothing you can remove before you're making a scene. 

On the other hand, people who are cold can bundle up. They can wear heavier clothes, put on a sweater, or even run a small space heater. 

There's also more health risk for the hot person. Feeling overheated triggers sweating, which can cause rashes and dehydration. Unless it's ridiculously cold, being cold isn't the same kind of health risk.

So, for these reasons, I believe a person who runs hot should be the one accommodated. I believe if you're someone who runs cold and you insist on being accommodated at the discomfort of a warmer person, you're inconsiderate and illogical.",Zogonzo,1496,0.8500000238418579,1316,1697998150,2023-10-22 13:09:10,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17dzdxk/cmv_its_not_unreasonable_to_expect_people_who_get/,10,2023

It's not that I disagree with the idea that some groups as a whole have more power and influence than other groups. I absolutely do, and I don't think this should be the case. I just don't think this information is remotely useful when it comes to policy. Because the problem you run into is while the group *collectively* has more power, most *individuals* lack any sort of meaningful power. 

So when a policy is proposed that disempowers the oppressor group the individuals at the top who are actually doing almost all of the oppressing are not affected, but rather the people at the bottom who are already lacking power to oppress anybody. So basically people who were already powerless to change anything are losing power they cannot afford to lose. That hardly seems like something to celebrate.

17f6fkz,CMV: No one should support Palestine,"There's quite a bit of posts about the conflict but if you're here then you're interested!

Quick note: I am not saying we should not support PalestiNIANS (the people), what they're going through is a horrendous nightmare

Anyway, I want to quickly say what I think I know so that if I'm mistaken it can be pointed out:

- Israel took over most of the surrounding land including what some argue rightfully belong to Palestine, and that this was a long time ago
- This conflict has lasted years and several battles, with the current one being yet another fight for Palestine to take their land back
- However, Israel has tried around 5 times to come to a peaceful agreement (involving the UN at some point) about these lands which have been rejected by Palestine every time
- Lastly, the initiators of today's conflict are literal terrorists

Ok and this is why I hold my view:

- First of all, Palestine begun this conflict (again). Why is anyone supporting the perpetrator of a war that has already caused so much destruction and murder of innocent people
- Also, these were TERRORISTS!!! There's a group in my home country that are similar to Hamas, and if they ever pulled something like this I would never support my country... yet so many support this.
- Israel has had this land for a decently long time, why is Palestine still fighting for it? They're clearly militarily inferior and can't protect it, they should be taking a peace treaty at all costs
- I understand the implications of the land being controlled by Israel (Economic troubles and such) but does this really justify the killing of thousands of innocent people?
- Lastly, it seems Israel is launching a counterattack that to me seems to be fair, they keep getting attacked for the same thing so it's time to shut off Hamas for good. Hamas uses civilians to protect itself while Israel seems to just want to protect its people whatever the cost.

I understand that because of the recent border blockage many Palestenians do not have access to food which is very unjust and horrible to the innocent people, but this has been a common tactic to pressure governments to stop attacks and converse diplomatically or surrender.

That is all, I'm very open to having my view changed on this matter if I'm persuaded. And just in case this is brought up; I am not from either of these countries or their surrounding areas, and I'm also not originally from any of the countries are actively supporting either side, I hold this view purely out of the information I have provided.",Juanito2Gud,466,0.7799999713897705,1089,1698129525,2023-10-24 01:38:45,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17f6fkz/cmv_no_one_should_support_palestine/,10,2023

And the focus seems to be ever louder and ever present.

But I had a realization recently. I think it passed some kind of a tipping point at some time. Somewhere along the way, race has moved too far into the forefront of my consciousness. It's gotten to a level where a persons race dominates my awareness throughout an interaction. It's become too much of a focus, when of course there is so much more to a person than some amalgamated racial milieu of experiences based on the color of their skin.

I think some people would look at this and say that's the point. But I just want to go back to seeing people as people, and let the racial awareness become secondary.

17g7i5l,CMV: Free market capitalism is an idealization of a planet with infinite resources.,"Everyone likes free-market economy, as its the basis of an ever-growing economic infrastructure: the capitalist system. But, have you ever thought about the actual implications of a non-regulated market? Every single thing we sell is related in some way or another to resources of the planet. In FME, selling derivates of natural resources is just ""transforming"" nature in order to introduce our product in market's offer supply. If the right conditions are met, this will increase the demand of that product, wich in turn lets us invest in resource extraction. This will ultimately increase offer, and then an ""economic loop"" can start, powered only earth's resources and capitalist market  relations. One does not need a PHD in mathematics to see how easily this can turn the numbers into the depletion of the original resource, ultimately privating ALL humanity of its benefits. Saying this is an idealization of reality is far from the cold facts: we are constantly transforming _clean air_ into _pollution and factories_, _energy_ into _power and an increase in temperature_, _free land_ into _urbanization and population growth_... But what can we do when those resources end up in depletion?  The answer is clear: be extinguished.",Contrapuntobrowniano,497,0.7699999809265137,553,1698247965,2023-10-25 10:32:45,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17g7i5l/cmv_free_market_capitalism_is_an_idealization_of/,10,2023
17ghhot,CMV: Racial tribalism is bad.,"I am Asian American. I am wholly Asian and wholly American, yet I interact with people from various different cultural, religious, ethnic, racial, and national backgrounds on a daily basis. Racial tribalism would be the exact opposite, sticking to one's own racial or cultural group and interacting with people from other racial or cultural groups as minimally as possible, or not at all. As an Asian American, I think my racial group (at least where I live in San Diego) is well integrated with the rest of American society and have friends of many different races or cultural backgrounds. However, it pisses me off that many younger Asian Americans also often defend racial tribalism (which I've witnessed frequently), just because their parents did it despite the fact they don't really engage in racial tribalism themselves. Racial tribalism harms society and us individually, and I'll delve into both here:

Firstly, racial tribalism is a severe impediment to social cohesion. If we try to interact with each other as little as possible, how can we cooperate, innovate, or progress? We become unable to address and fix problems together as a society because of our balkanization. The only way to get shit done is to unite. It also certainly leads to ""othering"" and stereotypes, which are the first steps towards full blown racism. What is especially hypocritical is that the same Asian Americans who defend racial tribalism also complain when we get stereotyped or people are uneducated about our culture. The Nazis and imperial Japanese were racial tirbalists, though of course at a scale not present today. But of course, they didn't start out at that scale either... We become ignorant of the other side, which is especially said to see as I love engaging with and interacting with different cultures. It is very enriching and you learn a lot.

Additionally, it can inhibit us individually. When we (I don't mean specifically Asians, I mean ""we"" just as a pronoun) ""other"" other races, then they will ""other"" us back. This can negatively impact people emotionally. Also, when we interact with as many people as possible regardless of race, our social networking and opportunities increase as a result.

Of course this isn't to mean people can't want to spend time with people of a similar culture, but they should feel comfortable interacting with a larger multiracial society as a whole. I can understand how many groups such as the Chinese, Blacks, Italians, Irish, Jews, Mexicans, Japanese, Arabs, etc were forced to tribalize in the past (in American history), but now is a different time and America is the greatest melting pot in the world and we should not take it for granted.",RealFee1405,771,0.8299999833106995,525,1698273978,2023-10-25 17:46:18,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17ghhot/cmv_racial_tribalism_is_bad/,10,2023

I have opinions on the matter, but their irrelevant to this post. Whenever something horrible happens, a politician may soon after suggest that it is evidence that a change of some kind needs to be made. While shootings are the obvious example, its not the only one. If, for instance, a state had a natural disaster, a politician might soon after suggest that it could have been handled better if we made certain reforms. After they do so however, you're likely to see a lot of people (including other politicians) call them out for ""politicizing a tragedy""

Ideally, politicians SHOULD be doing things to try and prevent further tragedies, so it makes sense to learn from the ones that have happened and to use them to make a point. Thats a part of their job of trying to make good decisions for society and represent people. Are they trying to get points politically from doing so? Probably, though in most cases I doubt it's their only reason. But whatever, their trying to earn political points on a constant basis, and there are far more immoral ways of doing so than simply using a tragedy to illustrate highlight a good or bad policy suggestion.

17idvo4,CMV: Muslims in the west will always prefer their co religionists to their host country,"Maybe this is controversial but this is something I’ve thought for a while. Whenever a tragedy happens in the Muslim world, or whenever Muslims are attacked or their religion is criticised, no matter where it is, Muslims in the west or elsewhere all come together. They band together and they defend one another. Be it in the current israel-Palestine conflict, the persecution of Muslims in China, Kashmir, or protesting sometimes violently over things like Charlie Hebedo Muhammad cartoons. And yet they never do the same when some tragedy hits their adopted country particularly in the west.

Take the UK for example. Muslims here remained silent when Pakistani grooming gangs raped and abused white women across the uk over the last fifty years. I’d they ever spoke about it, it was ti say how this was victimising them. Or in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing, or the stabbing of David Ames (an MP), or the London Bridge terrorist attack. Or the fact that a teacher in the UK had to go into hiding for discussion whether it was right to show a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad. Or when some Muslims  threatened with death a school boy who supposedly scuffed a Quran by accident t and they forced his mother to beg for forgiveness.

Or even recently when after the recent flare up in the ME, we e seen a 1450% increase in anti semitic crime. And yet they’ve usually just kept silent or said it’s to be expected.

They never come out and show any sympathy or horror when these things happen. Instead they often seem to show sympathy with those Muslims who commit these atrocities.

That and the broader incidents mentioned before   me suggests Muslims particularly in the west will never actually try and show any support or dare I say it loyalty to the country they are in if it is not a Muslim country.

Why?  What age range is it ok then? 

In a world where we beg to “let kids be kids” why is a 14 even 17 year old not yet adult is given grief when dressing up, enjoying the outdoors, spending time with friends or family or even alone and getting free candy? 

Isn’t this better than many other possibly delinquent activities they could be doing? Is it too naïve to think that kids who are out causing trouble might be less inclined to smash pumpkins if they didn’t feel it was “uncool” to trick-or-treat and felt more welcomed to participate?

It's making the movement come off as ideological instead of rational as well as ambivalent to human suffering, not unlike the ways in which Israel has been ideological and ambivalent to the suffering of Palestinians. I think, to most people, the very true fact that Israel's treatment of Palestine *explains* the situation is simply not enough to *justify* the deaths of civilians, and that disconnect is hurting the reputation of the free Palestine movement. Hamas has damaged the reputation of Palestine by targeting civilians, and supporters of a free Palestine would rally far more support if they'd communicate, directly and without concession, the fact that the actions of Hamas were morally reprehensible, without concluding that they were ""necessary"" or, in so many words, that ""Israel had it coming."" Unless the majority of Pro-Palestine individuals *are* indeed Pro-Hamas (which I don't want to just assume flippantly because I have no way of knowing whether or not that's true) I don't understand why more people don't condemn Hamas explicitly instead of responding to the attack on Gaza with Pro-Palestine sentiments.

17kkff5,CMV: men should offer women their number instead of asking them for theirs.,"So in our current society we have a few gender norms that are pretty dumb and downright destructive. One of those is that men are supposed to chase and be active while dating. Women on the otherhand are reactive. Pretty much everyone would benefit if we got rid of this dynamic. 

A common issue men face is that women often times give out their number when asked, even if they aren’t actually interested. That means they either never text back or they only text back to be polite. And men are often seen as overly aggressive if they keep texting. 

So here’s my solution; When you approach a woman and want to get to know her, don’t ask her for her number. Offer her your own. That way, she has more agency and it avoids weird situations. If she does text, it’s clear that she’s interested. No games. No weird chasing. Should become the norm honestly. 
Its also in line with empowerment for women.

The important items that seem to always get conflated into Socialism and Capitalism are checks on power and free and democratic elections. Without strong institutions in these two aspects, the state will soon lapse into dictatorships, authoritarianism and/or totalitarianism. I'm not an expert in either of these areas, so I'm happy to enlightened here, but these Capitalism vs Socialism arguments always seem strange to me. Proponents on both sides always seem to feel like the other system is inherently evil when it seems obvious that there has to be some kind of hybrid model between the two.

Conservatives have been the ones banning books from libraries. We all know conservative parents (especially religious ones) who cannot tolerate their kids having different opinions. Conservative subs on Reddit are just as prone to banning someone for having opposing views as liberal ones.  Conservatives were the ones who got outraged about athletes kneeling during the national anthem, as if that gesture weren't quintessential free speech. When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he promptly banned many users who disagreed with him. Conservatives have been trying to pass ""don't say gay"" and ""stop woke"" legislation in Florida and elsewhere (and also anti-BDS legislation in Texas to penalize those who oppose Israel). For every anecdote about a liberal teacher giving a conservative student a bad grade for being conservative, you can find an equal example on the reverse side.

Firstly, bottled water companies upcharge massively due to the cost of producing plastic bottles, so bottled water costs hundreds of times more than tap water. It would be like paying $300 for something you can get for $1.

It was upsetting to see somebody who, based on the comments, really hadn't done anything bash themselves over and over again for not being good enough. And this is by no means the first time I've seen this behavior. I think many on the left see it as a good thing, that if society can shake white men's core sense of self they'll be open to learning about other perspectives. 

I think the opposite is true.

17mtqet,CMV: the United States government should pay teachers similar to military service members relative to experience and education,"I served in the US Army and my final rank was Sergeant (E5). I am currently a math teacher with a MS in Math plus an additional 30 graduate credit hours and 14 years of teaching experience. 

My current salary is $68,000 and I live in a rural area in Northern Georgia. While cost of living is low here, I can't help but look up what my pay would had been had I stayed in the military - even if I stay as E5, with my wife and kid, my base pay plus BAH would put me at around the same as my current salary, without the degrees and I am not even counting my qualifiers that would net higher pay. 

Both teachers and military are performing vital public services, so why is pay gap this enormous? Objectively, my job in the Army was far easier - I only need to focus on my mission and manage fewer than 5 personnel who have to complete basic training/AIT, so in a sense, self-selected. Whereas as a teacher, I am responsible for the learning outcome of 30+ young people who often do not want to be here.

I have to complete 6 years of higher education in STEM program to even get started in my teaching career for my current pay track (I would get paid even less if I only have a BS) plus it took me years in teaching before I firmly grasp the craft of education; whereas I enlisted in the Army when I was 17 with just a HS diploma, promoted to E5 after 2 years in services (I joined as E3 due to JROTC, received a waiver for E4 at 18 months TIS, then promoted to E5 in secondary zone), I know that is a bit faster than most, but I didn't really need to have much qualifications for my enlistment and promotions. 

As an E5, I was highly expendable. I get it that recruitment number are low but someone else could have easily done replaced me. Yet, as a math teacher, it is next to impossible for me to be replaced. Our department have been operating with 
 less than 75% faculty due to multiple people leaving within the past few years and we simply failed to attract new hires. As of the past 4 years, I am the only person in my department who is qualified to teach Statistics, all of us are teaching more students, committing more tutoring hours... The point is, the military recruitment shortage isn't due to low pay, but teacher shortage is.

My view is that Americans should commit to paying teachers just as much as paying military service members, after all, one cannot function without another.",JianJiaHei,479,0.8299999833106995,576,1699013799,2023-11-03 07:16:39,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17mtqet/cmv_the_united_states_government_should_pay/,11,2023

17now0j,CMV: Leftists/LGBTQ+ people who support Palestine doesn't make sense.,"I'll start by saying I'm from SEA, so my perspective may be incomplete and I may have missing information, but I'll start with what information I think I know:

My understanding is Israel was formed after WW2 to give surviving Jews their own nation. This displaced the Palestinian people and while some do integrate into current Israel, a large number are in Palestine and over several years Israel has treated them badly and displaced them from their homes.

A few months ago Hamas, which my understanding is a terrorist group but is also supported and elected by the majority of Palestinians, launched a cowardly terrorist attack that killed many innocent people.

In response, Israel has acted like the US did after 9/11 and has attacked Palestine relentlessly. 

Since then, I've seen a large population of left leaning and LGBTQ+ people supporting Palestine, as well as rightist nazi 4channers. This confounds me. I expect the nazi 4channer types to support Hamas because they hate jews and Israel, but the other side confuses me.

My understanding is a large amount of palestinians support the terrorist attack, and also a lot of muslims hate LGBTQ+ people and would kill them if they could.

So I don't understand how anyone part of those communities could support people who hate them and would kill them, just because Israel is taking revenge.

I feel like if you do a terrorist attack, you're now in the ""find out"" phase of the ""fuck around and find out"" phase.

Looking for some perspective on why so many leftists support Hamas/Palestine on this. What do they honestly expect Israel to do in response to this attack? If the attack leads to Israel bending the knee, wouldn't that encourage more muslim terrorists to attack Israel? they can't afford to look weak.

I'm open to having my view changed but I do strongly think it's foolish and a case of ""living in an ivory tower"" if you're part of these communities and pledge your support of Palestine/Hamas.",fexterslab,825,0.6100000143051147,3365,1699114064,2023-11-04 11:07:44,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17now0j/cmv_leftistslgbtq_people_who_support_palestine/,11,2023
17nqvow,"CMV: Any ethic group (including whites) can experience racism, it is just that the defenition of racism has changed to only include ""structural"" racism.","Hello,

My place of work has recently been running workshops on ""anti-racism"". I myself have been trying to engage with it as much as I can to try and better myself. 

One aspect that I find difficult is the idea that racism has to have a power inbalance. In my own country (the UK) a white person cannot experience racism as they hold more structural power. They can be *discriminated* against but that is not racism. 

I find this idea difficult for two main reasons:

1. I always thought and was taught growing up that racism is where you disciminate based off of the colour of someones skin. In that definition, a white person can experience racism. The white person may not be harmed as much by it, but it is still discriminating agaist someone based on their race. 
2. In my place of work (a school), we have to often deal with racist incidents. One of the most common so far this year is racist remarks from black students towards asian ones. Is this racism? I can't confidently decide who has the greater power imbalance! 

I promise that this is coming from a place of good faith!

17p10mg,CMV: democracy cannot tolerate ignorance. Sovereignty for the undereducated is bad for democracy.,"Democracy requires a highly educated electorate; democracy collapses if the people lack advanced education.

It sounds elitist sure, but I strongly believe that it’s true. Popular sovereignty is a nice idea, but an extremely bad one. Literacy tests were certainly abused during the Jim Crow era, but they have well-founded reasoning behind them. 

Demagoguery can really only occur if the population is ignorant enough to believe that the would-be tyrant isn’t lying; or that history repeats itself. 

Take Trump for example. Those who haven’t read primary sources reflecting the rise of the German National Socialist Party might not see the parallels between American populism and German populism. Or at worst, people might not even know what populism is. 

From a policy perspective, the ignorant might think a bunch of government stimulus is a good thing and will never have any negative consequences. Whereas anyone who took high school economics could tell you that inflation will rise as a direct consequence of free money injected into consumer wallets. 

In countries where dictators or oligarchs rule, there is no need for a wise population. In fact, the stupider the better.

17q0cl6,CMV: There is no compelling reason to be angry about diversity in media,"Do you ever see those articles or videos of people complaining about ""wokeness"" in media, but they never quite describe what that is? Based on the context, it sounds like they're just complaining about diversity. I think more diversity is a good thing, because the world is diverse. That's just reality.  
  
I love the show Friends, but I'm going to pick on it a bit just as an example. It takes place in New York, and all the main characters are straight white people. Almost all the supporting characters are white people. It isn't very realistic in its portrayal of New York, because the city in reality is not 99% white people.  
  
My point is-- having more diversity makes sense and is more of a good thing than a bad thing. It's a net positive.  
  
Now let's look at some of the arguments these people make:  
  
**""Executives are forcing diversity just to pander.""**  
  
Probably. But executives have always pandered. Their job is to appeal to people in order to maximize profit. Why zero in on diversity as the main cause of this? It's a broader issue of studios chasing the dollar. At least in this case, the result of having more diversity isn't really a bad thing.  
  
**""They sacrifice good writing for diversity.""**  
  
Once again, these are two separate things. I agree that telling a good story should be the focus. Why would diversity have anything to do with this? Why pick out diversity as the thing that is making movies forget to tell a good story? There have always been poorly written movies long before diversity was encouraged.  
  
**""They make unnecessary changes to things we love.""**  
  
Anytime something is brought back for a reboot or new adaptation, there are going to be changes. Not all of these changes will be strictly ""necessary"". As long as you don't have an attitude of being resistant to all change, I don't see why changing something just to be more diverse is a bad thing. Why not instead just blame the changes that actually harm the story and characters? A minor change like a character having a different skin color does not sound harmful to me. It sounds like a very minor change.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
To bring it all together, let's suppose they rebooted Friends with entirely new actors playing the same characters. And none of the acting was good. And they changed the race of one of the the main characters. And the writing was terrible. What would you think of all this? What would you mention in a critical review of it?  
  
I would think rebooting it in the first place is a completely unnecessary cash grab. I would be irritated by how bad the writing is. And I would point out how the new portrayals are not nearly as good as the original cast. So I'd have a lot of criticisms of the reboot, but none of this has anything to do with diversity or being ""woke"". If they decided to make Rachel black, I wouldn't care that the character was black. I would care that the new actor doesn't do as good of a job as Jennifer Aniston.  
  
Am I missing something? Where does this anger towards diversity come from?",Hal87526,1022,0.6800000071525574,1494,1699380369,2023-11-07 12:06:09,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17q0cl6/cmv_there_is_no_compelling_reason_to_be_angry/,11,2023
17qex82,"CMV: The narrative that ""a voice actor should only voice characters of the race they belong to"" is not only nonsense, but has the potential to horribly backfire on the people promoting it if applied to them without excuses and compromises.","Let's deconstruct this narrative. It's very straightforward. A voice actor of race X, should only voice a character also of race X. If character is of race Y, then only a voice actor of race Y should play that character.  
I disagree with this. To me, voice acting comes down to the quality of your voice, your ability to take on the role and voice it. To me the narrative being put forward is nonsense, because what it is pushing goes against what I see voice acting as. It promotes the disqualification of a so many talents, based on solely on their race. We demote ourselves from choosing quality to now choosing skin color.  
Now to be clear, I am not saying people of a race are not good at voicing certain races or their own race. Rather, I am arguing that we are making quality less of a priority. And to illustrate this, let me entertain two scenarios:  
1. A white voice actor is chosen to voice a person of color because they are better at voicing the \*\*character\*\*, than the voice actor who is of the same race of the character, \*\*but\*\* is not as suited to the character as the people making the content desire.  
2. A \*\*non-white\*\* and \*\*non-Japanese\*\* voice actor, is chosen to voice a \*\*Japanese\*\* character in an anime, even though the character is not their race, because their voice acting ability is better suited to that character than the available Japanese voice actors who are the character's race, but not as suited for that character.  
I support both of these scenarios for being reality, because in both cases the \*quality\* of the persons ability to voice the character is what took priority. If the voice actor is chosen for a character who is also of their race, it should be because they had the talent to voice a character, who is not just defined by their skin but their way talking, the \*personality\* of their voice, which the actor was able to bring out better than other actors. Not because they were the same race as that character.  
Now I also made the claim in my view that the narrative has the potential to \*backfire\* on the people promoting it. And to explain it quite simply I need only point out that the people promoting these views... A themselves voicing characters not of their race. I don't even mean voicing non-human-like characters. I mean human beings or human equivalent characters who are of a certain race/ethnicity, being represented by voice actors who are not that race/ethnicity.  
For example:  
Mr SungWon Cho. Ethnicity: Korean.  A prominent promoter of this narrative.  
His roles include:  
Vice Admiral Legrange - Anglo-French ([86](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24481))  
Kajinosuke Tanikaze - Japanese ([Records of Ragnarok](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24643))  
Koutaro Tatsumi - Japanese ([The Honor Student at Magic High School](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=23898))  
This nice video reel of his roles [on his Twitter (X) account](https://twitter.com/i/status/1717961644331208749). Plenty of non-Asian, let alone non-Korean roles there  
Ms Shakyra Dunn. Ethnicity: Black as per her twitter. An example I wish to put forward of who this would backfire on.  
Her roles are all compiled her by herself which saved me a lot of trouble:  
[On her instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx5yR18uKwW/)  
Now if we were to apply this narrative upon them, then they would have to relinquish a great number of roles, not because they can't voice them well, but because they are not the same race/ethnicity. And I am willing to bet that a good number of the voice actors who promote this narrative would also lose a large portion of their roles, because they do not fit the race of the character. In other words, it would backfire on them.  
The only way to avoid this backfiring would be to make exceptions and compromises. To say ""Oh well but this is different...."". No if we are going to go with this, then we need to go all the way. If this narrative is going to dominate voice acting then everyone should face the consequences that come with it, regardless of their race. And that would be the biggest backfire for the entire voice acting community for what I believe is absolute nonsense.  
It would reduce voice acting to be a race based profession first and talent based profession second. The mighty Kratos from God of War (Norse) is voiced by Christopher Judge, a man who has my favorite voice for Kratos in the series. But Kratos is Greek. And since voice acting is supposed to be done by the matching race.. Oh well I guess Christopher loses his job huh?  
I hope I have properly illustrated my view. And hope to see if anyone can find a way to change my view. You may change it by convincing me that voice acting should be about race first and talent second and that this would not backfire on the people promoting it.",Delusional_Gamer,805,0.8799999952316284,324,1699421910,2023-11-07 23:38:30,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17qex82/cmv_the_narrative_that_a_voice_actor_should_only/,11,2023

1) national debt. American interest is at ...like almost a trillion dollars today. That didn't just ""happen"", obviously ""hey do you want to borrow money somebody else will have to pay""... who says ""no"", right? not america or canada. 

2) constantly increasing minimum wage throughout their working life, while engaging in free trade deals to make it easy to outsource work for cheap products. then, engaging in mass immigration because foreign workers will accept jobs for passports that kids just wont do that cheap.

3) underfunding education once they or their own kids had graduated. They increased class size, started giving university spots to foreign students, and allowing raising tuition to make it less accessible/more daunting. they also removed or reduced public childcare programs in many places.

4) sending cities and other governments into debt with spending that increases the value of their land,    and not raising property taxes like other taxes.

First of all, if high schools actually taught classes like taxes and personal financial literacy nobody would pay attention anyways. Second of all most people don't understand that subjects like math and science are like weightlifting for your brain. When do you ever see a football player ever do a squat on the field? Never, but doing squats builds up a level of strength in the legs that is vital to being a good football player. Same thing with school.

17ugk46,CMV: The majority of people who think the economy is doing poorly dont understand inflation and the process of getting it under control and instead think they would be better off in a recession,"A large percentage of people currently believe that Biden is doing terrible on the economy, largely due to inflation and difficulty affording things. I think that is entirely because they do not have an understanding of what inflation actually is and dont realize that this is, in fact, the ideal scenario. 

When Biden was inaugurated, inflation was at 7.7% and is currently down to 3.7%. While still elevated, this is a remarkable improvement and the fact that we are slowly approaching the ideal rate of 2% without entering a recession and having people continued to be employed is remarkable. I think, what people dont understand, is that inflation is cumulative and the numbers will never go back down without major things happening and I would like to use the example of food to illustrate this. There are two things that will cause the price of food to largely return to where it was, either a technological breakthrough that doubles yields (not happening) or, the more likely scenario, a drastic decrease in demand because people are out of work and are no longer able to afford anything because the economy is in a recession. I think this later scenario is what many are naively arguing for! 

In addition, I dont think they really understood the 3 paths that we were facing at that time. The first path was runaway inflation, second path was slowly decreasing the inflation rate to 2%, and the third path was entering into a recession. I think we are currently on this middle path and seem to be doing it really well, but if you look at posts all over reddit, people will say, ""the economy isnt doing great, I can barely afford my rent and groceries when I used to be able to"". I am not saying that isnt true, but they dont realize that that is the goal. Would they rather we have entered into runaway inflation?

17v10la,CMV: Trump’s odds of winning in 2024 are significantly overstated in betting markets (currently a 50/50 on predictit),"I feel that giving trump 50/50 odds of winning the 2024 presidential election is overly generous. 

Ever since Trump initially won in 2016, Republicans have failed to win at a national level. 2018 was considered a disappointment for them, trump lost in 2020, 2022 “red wave” never materialized, and now suddenly we’re supposed to believe that 2024 will turn things around. 

For Trump to win, he needs to pick up 3 of the 6 below states- 

- Georgia
- Wisconsin
- Arizona
- Pennsylvania
- Michigan
- Nevada

Georgia went blue because of the growth of Atlanta, which has only continued to grow. The population has gone up by 300,000 people since 2020. The whole j6 and Georgia lawsuits has only served to hurt Trump’s image in that state. I consider his odds of flipping that state very poor considering his position is weaker than the last time he lost.

I consider his odds to win in Pennsylvania incredibly poor, considering how his endorsement of Oz couldn’t beat a disabled candidate in the senate. PA is getting bluer. 

Michigan is a lost cause for the GOP considering how Tudor Dixon performed there. 

I almost didn’t include Nevada in this list because it has always felt like a stretch for the trump campaign. It’s a state that has very slowly started to shift red, but Trump needs to find 30,000 votes to flip there in 24 to win it and I don’t see where they will come from. 

Arizona is like 60/40 for Biden because of the continued growth of Phoenix and the unpopularity of trump there due to his arduous history with John McCain. 

And finally there’s Wisconsin, which was incredibly close and I guess he could win in 24. They had a winning gop race I recently. To be nice to him, let’s say that one is 60/40 for trump.

So that’s 1 state that he is 60/40 likely win (Wisconsin), 1 where he’s a 60/40 on the losing end (Arizona), and 4 where I consider his chance of victory to be very poor. I’ll assign them 25% chances of winning each. 

Plugging those odds into a calculator online, I see that his odds of winning would really be 11.27%, rather than 50/50. 

I believe that my estimates make sense given the current environment and issues like abortion making republicans have a very difficult uphill battle with voters. I’d be curious as to things I’m missing with my estimates that would require I shift my view.

17vzoxn,CMV: People who plan not to vote for Biden because of his handling of the Israel-Palestine conflict are damaging their own cause,"I understand that there are a lot of emotions about the current conflict, but the other day there was a pro-Palestine rally in my very liberal neighborhood and people were chanting “Fuck Joe Biden!” 

I was shocked and have since read that, among those who support Palestine, some are saying that Biden’s trip to Israel, his plan to send economic support for their army, and his speeches supporting them have cost him their vote in the 2024 presidential election.

Meanwhile, Trump is the one who recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, called for a ban of all Muslims immigrating to the United States and has recently suggested that we should ban anyone from Gaza from entering the United States. I read a quote from him stating that, if he were elected in 2024, “Israel would never have to be prepared” against future attacks, implying he would completely destroy Gaza to remove that threat. In short, Trump’s position is much more strongly pro-Israel and virulently anti-Palestine than Biden.

Additionally, although Biden has supported Israel, he has also reportedly urged caution about the scale of the invasion, voiced disagreement with Israel’s handling of the war, and insisted on humanitarian pauses and delivery of aid to the Gazan people. In short he seems to be a voice of reason and advocating for civilian safety.

Granted that some progressives in deep blue states abstaining from voting for Biden may not swing the election to Trump. However, if it does and Trump assumes power, I think many of the people who support Palestine will be sorry with their decision.",Advanced_Piano1062,398,0.7400000095367432,505,1700071778,2023-11-15 12:09:38,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17vzoxn/cmv_people_who_plan_not_to_vote_for_biden_because/,11,2023
17wqbsc,CMV: an engagement ring should be given back if the engagement is called off.,"I was watching a Netflix show where a woman decides she’s no longer attracted to her fiancé so she breaks things off. When he asks for the ring back she refuses, he hesitates then agrees that she can keep it and angrily claims that every time she sees it she’ll think of their short lived relationship. 

This got me thinking of my ex fiancé, and how I broke things off, I did pretty much the same thing and she claimed it was so pretty so I gave in and let her keep it, eventually I got it back but there was no reason for her to keep it in the first place as an engagement ring represents a promise, it’s usually expensive, and it basically turns into a trophy celebrating how I got this person to propose to me, it seems almost greedy or narcissistic to keep.

There is no valid argument given as for why certain animals should be ethical to consume as meat and others should not be (other than, perhaps, that certain animals are killed in more inhumane ways than others, but the objection has often persisted even *if* they were all to be killed the same way.)

**Cuteness:**  The argument is oft-given that dogs and cats are cuter than pigs and chickens, and hence should not be consumed. But this is highly subjective. What if I find chickens to be cute, but don't think cats or horses are cute?

**Intelligence:** The argument is oft-given that dogs, dolphins, monkeys are more intelligent, and hence should not be consumed. But the octopus is a highly intelligent animal, yet people don't object to it being eaten.

**""It's gross"":**  This is also highly subjective. One may think it's gross to eat horse meat, but then again many cultures consume pork while Muslims think pork is despicable. So if I think it is gross but you think it's okay, why should my preferences overrule yours?

17xur4t,CMV: Vegan “leather” is dumb,"Alright first off I would like to make it clear that this is not an attack on veganism; its a noble cause to minimize the suffering of animals but vegan leather in particular is a terrible alternative. Although I am not vegan because meat tastes too good.

Firstly its simply lower quality that real leather.
Leather fibrous structure is much more durable than faux, leading it to last longer. Even if its for something that doesn't need to be resilient, leather patinas beautifully as it ages, while faux just breaks down and cracks. Because of this vegan leather is replaced more often than produced more waste.

Not only does faux create more waste but it also is much worse for the environment. Leather is biodegradable because it obviously comes from animals. 90% of vegan leather is made of plastic which cant say the same. There are some alternative vegan leathers made of cactus and other stuff but they are uncommon and still mixed with synthetic materials which also do not biodegrade.

So vegan leather produces more waste, and is more environmentally taxing but at least its free from animal suffering right? Well yes, but you can make an argument that leather is too. Almost all leather is a biproduct of the meat industry, meaning cows aren't being killed for their hides. If we all stopped buying leather it wouldn't have a major effect on the quantity of cows being slaughtered, we'd just use less of the cows. I view it like the Native Americans and the buffalo. To show respect for the buffalo they used everything. Nothing went to waste. Their hide is better as a pair of boots than rotting in a landfill.

Anyway if anyone feels I am misunderstanding why people prefer vegan leather, change my view. Thanks",SennheiserHD6XX,804,0.7599999904632568,516,1700270417,2023-11-17 19:20:17,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17xur4t/cmv_vegan_leather_is_dumb/,11,2023

But I’m disappointed in F1 and feel bad for their Vegas fans. From what I heard, the race really affected the locals and used local taxes.

Now, IMO I feel like because of this cities should give the residents a voice in if these sorts of events take place in the city. Because from the way I see it, all this race did was take tax dollars from the residents, then spit at their feet by using those same tax dollars to put up barriers just so the people couldn’t see. 

By having a vote, people could choose if they’d want their city to do something like this.

17zm3f0,CMV: people that don't opt-in for organs donation should go bottom of the list when it comes to become recipients,"This post is on the back of yesterday's post about how the default for organs donation should be opt-in and people should explicitly state that they want ot opt-out.

I was quite shocked at how many replies were against it, some people talked about ""tricking"" people, I'm not sure why, informative campaign could be done, is not some complex concept that the average person in the street can't understand. Also I'm not going into the debate on why people would rather have their organs rot in the ground instead of helping a fellow human being, but here's a proposal that I think would reconcile these views:

We keep the system as it is, but if you don't opt-in as an organ donor you go to the bottom of the list if you ever need one. Here are some points that got me to this idea:

* We already give priorities to organ recipients: age, medical history, etc (basically chances of survival) are already taken into consideration when lists are compiled, it's not just first come first served.
* It totally respects individual freedom
* It incentivize much needed organs donation  
* it's fair to people that opted in 

Just to reiterate: I'm not saying that people that are not organ donors DON'T get an organ ever, only that they get a lower score compared to people that opted-in, that's only fair, if you think your organs are too precious to donate even when you're dead, surely you can't expect others to do any differently. Otherwise you're just an HYPOCRITE. It's all about FAIRNESS. 

Now, I'm bias to the argument, my other half has received a kidney and is one of those things that people that haven't been through can't understand what it means to see a loved one getting sick, going through dialysis, going through the long process of getting into a recipient list and finally the long wait. 

Final couple of points: 

I'm sure there're super rare occasions where my POV may create some contradictions, we can discuss them and (as a society) find a solution, I don't believe in discarding good ideas just because they are not so good in the 0.1% of cases.   
Different countries have different protocols for organ donation/transplant. So pointing why it wouldn't work due to a specific law/regulation is a bit of a weak argument. I believe in principle every modern democratic country could implement this idea.

17zz6u2,"CMV: Only Individuals, NOT limited liability entities, should be allowed to legally own real property zoned for single families.","There has been a housing crisis in the United States since the turn of the century. The damn broke in 2008 when large financial institutions violently awoke the nation from her American dream of homeownership. There has been a wealth “crisis” developing since the turn of the 19th century where individual wealth has depleted while corporately owned wealth has skyrocketed. Even the richest billionaire is but a worthless pauper compared to average multinational corporations. These two crises are related. The monumental wealth of large enterprises and the increasing poverty of the bourgeoisie has caused the prospect of owning a parcel of the planet earth ever more illusory each decade. 

We almost forget that *American* society exists to protect the citizen against the collective. This is *not* a socialist state, the rights of the individual are paramount against the rights of the group or the state. The citizen serves themselves, the citizen does not serve the state nor the corporation. To paraphrase, the Declaration of Independence holds that once a government no longer permits the citizen to live and die according to their means and abilities, the government must be dissolved by any means necessary. 

I am not saying that the US ought to collapse because of modern social inequalities like many radicals on the far left/right. Instead, I think a sensible solution to the dual problems of inequality and the lack of owned real properties is a simple change in national policy. It should be law across every jurisdiction that areas zoned for “single-family” homes can only be sold to individuals born of woman. No entities may own real property zoned like this, unless such an entity exposes their owners to unlimited liability. 

I mention all the stuff about American culture/law to undermine the argument that prohibiting corporations from purchasing would violate the “freedom” of a corporation to engage in the market. Individuals have freedoms under the Constitution, and individuals may associate freely. But such associations should not have the same claim to rights/freedoms that individuals have. This argument is unavailing because society serves the individual, not the collective. 

Another counterargument I can imagine is that the economy might suffer because (1) housing prices are inflated; (2) the only entities that can reliably pay inflated prices with ready cash (or favorable financing) are corporate entities; and (3) if the wealthiest entities in the market are banned from buying, housing prices would dramatically collapse. Last time housing prices collapsed, Obama had to give billions to banking executives lest their feelings got hurt. /s (kinda). To this argument, I say the ends would justify the means. Billions in home equity would evaporate so that future generations could have a justifiable hope in affordable home ownership. 

TL;DR: Perpetuating the American dream for current and future generations of homebuyers is more important than big business profit and the retirement plans of current homeowners. Therefore business should be unilaterally banned from owning single-family owned property, any business currently owning such property should divest ASAP.",Ok-Story-9319,1134,0.9200000166893004,741,1700514881,2023-11-20 15:14:41,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17zz6u2/cmv_only_individuals_not_limited_liability/,11,2023
180kyd2,CMV: I don't think the Marvels failed because moviegoers are sexist and racist,"As somebody who enjoys writing, I can empathize with the director Nia DaCosta. I would be heartbroken if a story I'd poured blood, sweat, and tears into was shunned by so many people and, going by any metric, the Marvels has failed to attract audiences. 

Nia DaCosta herself did an interview in which she said ""There are pockets that are really virulent and violent and racist — and sexist and homophobic and all those awful things. And I choose the side of the light. That’s the part of fandom I’m most attracted to."" I don't think it's fair to interpret that as her saying superhero fans in general are these things or the movie failed because of these things as some people are. 

But there are others who are convinced bigotry is responsible for the failure of ""The Marvels"" or at least primarily responsible. Based on the data I've seen, I don't think this is the case. It's true that white people and men didn't turn out in large numbers which could suggest bigotry was a major factor. But nobody else did either. 

So why did the Marvels perform poorly? In my view...

The Marvels itself does not score particularly well with critics. This is probably the biggest factor. A movie can have legs if it gets good word of mouth from viewers and critics. Elemental is a great example. Bombed initially, but came roaring back. The A cinema score no doubt helped it. And elemental touched on racism and discrimination too.

182fd42,CMV: Nobody has the inherent right to any territory,"Nobody has the inherent right to any piece of land

I often hear the idea that certain groups of people have the inherent right to any group of land because ""they were there first"", and I hear this regarding many groups like native Americans, the Jewish state, or others.

But the reality is that nobody has any inherent right to a piece of land. Maps are drawn through war, and territory belongs to whichever group can conquer it. Some people may be forgetting that because the borders of western nations haven't been redrawn for a while.

Just as the Comanche conquered land in America's southern territory and took it from the Apache, the American government conducted a series of wars against the native Americans and took land from them.

Japan used to be numerous states but a man by the name of Oda Nobunaga led a series of conquests in order to unite Japan into a single nation. He died, but his goal was fulfilled by some other individuals.

We see the same thing happening right now in Ukraine. If Russia can take it then it's their territory. But Ukraine seems to be quite capable in defending themselves, so they get to keep ownership of the territory. And the same thing is happening in Gaza right now. If Hamas can defend the territory then they can keep it, but otherwise they might lose it.

This might sound insensitive but this is just the way the world works and is how it has always worked. Your right to a piece of property is upheld by the laws of your country. The laws are upheld by the government, and the Sovereignty of the government is upheld by the military establishment. Even countries without militaries are defended by (other) militaries.

183wtc2,"CMV: Female superheroes are ‘failing’ because they have no character arc, not because of PC culture","Seen a few posts on this topic recently, and I disagree with all of them. 

The reason female superhero movies are doing less successfully is primarily because their character arcs deviate from that of the standard superhero. The standard superhero starts off as weak person with low status in society (or a rich playboy with pain on the inside), acquires powers in a freak accident, goes through formative trials that test their abilities and their values, and then hones both of these just in time to fight the main villain. Female superheroes don’t have this same character arc: they start off every movie all powerful, like a literal invincible god. Their character arc tends to be, really, I don’t know, nothing… In essence, every single female superhero is Superman, except without kryptonite or Lois Lane. 

Take Wonder Woman for example. She starts off as a literal Amazon Goddess. Her only character arc is that she has to be taught by a man how to function in human society (sarcasm to point out that it was actually kind of a sexist movie). 

Take Captain Marvel for example. The most powerful Avenger who literally couldn’t be involved in all the movies or she’d break the story. She started off her first movie all powerful, just minus her memory… I’ll leave out for spoilers. Needless to say, she doesn’t really have significant personal growth, or growth in her powers. Wonder why her second movie bombed so hard.

Why can’t they just treat a female superhero like the first Spider-Man? Nerdy person gets superpowers, gets confidence, gets love interest and fights bad people? Is it maybe because the directors themselves are sexist and think people won’t take a female superhero seriously unless they make them incredibly powerful?

It’s not the fact that people don’t want to see a woman beat up men. People love superhero movies.

I live in Germany as an immigrant, and I have friends from all across the world. I am European. 

Across the bank, the majority of friends I have met that were from outside of Europe had a very specific set of prejudices against me, that never really bothered me too much and just calmly explained this was not a thing in my country. 

I have noticed, however, that some things always repeated although being absolutely absurd. Here are some examples of the things I have been told/ were expected of me.

- I am Italian. We have very simple cuisine but it's good. The same friends who tell me this about ""white people"" love my cooking and ask for my recipes/ to make their favourite dish again. 

2) Not having an own culture

- A friend of mine said something along the lines of ""White people appropriate other cultures and festivities because they don't really have their own"". I believe we were talking about Dia de los Muertos in that regard. But all European countries have their own very different cultures. 

In general, I don't think ""black culture"" and ""white culture"" apply to Europe the same way they do to the US. While there may be an african american culture across the U.S., my Ethiopian friend and my Tanzanian friend have just as little in common as a Russian and a Spanish person. They don't share one culture, they each have their own, which may overlap in some parts of life. 

3) My culture was never oppressed

I come from a part of Italy that used to have it's own language and traditions. When Italy was formed in the 19th century, people were forced to stop having their own customs and speaking their own language, or call themselves anything other than Italians. 

My grandparents still spoke the language, but I was never allowed to. I was expected to behave like an Italian so that I would have better chances in life and people would not know my background, which was considered lesser. 

I am not an exception. There are many ethnic groups in Europe that are considered white and still suffered oppression and sometimes persecution. I hate to see these stories devalued by someone saying a blanket statement.

4) This is silly, but the sandal

""White people will never understand how scary it is when your mother picks up the sandal"". But we do have the sandal in Italy. And when I pointed this out, I was told that that was cultural appropriation. 

5) Beige

""White people love to have their walls painted beige and all interior decor has to be beige.""

This was just yesterday. I talked about how houses in my region are not like that at all. And then I thought about it and described how Swedish houses are not like that. Nor are russian houses. Or French ones. Or Spanish ones. Or German ones, at that. Even my German friend, who initially agreed (in shame) that all white houses were just beige, did so while sitting in her perfectly colourful apartment with no beige in sight. I asked her if she had ever seen such a beige home in real life. She has not. Neither had anyone else, when we thought about it. 

To be honest, I don't even think most American white people live like that. I think it's just a social media fad. 



And that brings me to the reason why I am here:

As much as I am not upset at people when they make assumptions, it can be tiring when you hear the same things over and over again. I am upset that European people have to be culturally associated with North America just because we look similar, even though culturally we are so far apart. Social media paints a picture where every white person is from a Florida suburb, and people choose to believe it.

184bs54,"CMV: creationism should not be taught in public schools at all, even alongside evolution.","I was watching the Simpsons episode where they start teaching creationism alongside (later instead of) evolution in Springfield elementary. It was goofy, but while watching I remembered that my high school did the exact same thing. I went to a decently well-funded public school in the Midwest during the early 21st century. 

At the time I didn’t care all that much, I was raised Christian but I was always a curious kid so I already knew about and believed in evolution. Actually, I did care a little bit because, while on the debate team, I *lost* a debate regarding whether creationism should be taught in schools. So maybe you could say the episode reminded me of some embarrassing high school moments. 

I agree with the Simpsons: creationism should *not* be taught in school because there is no scientific merit to the book of Genesis. Schools are institutions of science and evolution is science. Churches are where children should learn about creationism and how religion squares with our contemporary world. 

Still, as an adult I don’t care all that much, so my opinion can still be subject to change. I lost the debate arguing that creationism should *not* be taught in public schools, so obviously there are valid arguments as to why creationism *should* be taught in schools. 

I should also note, I chose the words in the title carefully. Creationism should not be taught *at all.* In my school it was an option, you could learn about evolution and creationism in tandem. I’m taking a rather extreme position that creationism shouldn’t be taught at all. So maybe change my view so that I can see the merit of teaching them both and giving the option for students. Or change my view that creationism should be taught instead of the evolution hoax.

1858lk8,CMV: Not voting for Biden in 2024 as a left leaning person is bad political calculus,"Biden's handling of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts has encouraged many left-leaning people to affirm that they won't be voting for him in the general election in 2024. Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively.

Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest.

To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.

185skh3,CMV: I think it's insecure for people to try to control whether or not their partner watches p*rn,"I'm genuinely opened to have my opinion changed on this.

I think the porn industry is exploitative as hell. I think using porn on a daily basis is bad for your mental health and how you view relationships with people.

I definitely see the ethical concerns with porn consumption itself.

What bothers me is the insecurity people have with it.

I view myself as an inherently non-jealous person. It takes an awful lot for someone to make me jealous with my partner.

I think, I could see myself getting jealous if my boyfriend was getting nudes from another girl directly or sex tapes.

I can't understand why being interested in seeing another person naked would be an issue for someone. Isn't that just biology? Especially for men who are much more visual.

I think that having to shut that off to cater to a partner's insecurities is unreasonable. It's like asking someone to become asexual for anyone but you.

I genuinely don't understand. I've seen so many people talk about their partner's pornography use or even finding other people attractive on social media and becoming jealous over it.

Why is it ok to cater to that insecurity? Isn't that unhealthy in a relationship?

I also think men have different biological urges than women. Like, alot of men will get physically uncomfortable if they go too long without ejaculating. If they don't do it while awake, they'll do it in your sleep. I view it as a regulation like peeing or pooping, and porn just making it simpler.

I think it becomes an issue when it interferes with your sex life or you expect your partner to fill the void pornography does for you.

18624kk,CMV: far-right Muslim extremist organizations like Hamas should be treated the same way we treat far-right Christian extremist organizations.,"Progressive intersectionality has been a net asset for many causes including the struggle of oppressed minorities, women, LGBT groups, etc...

However, in recent times, it has lost its focus by trying to include supporting far-right religious extremists such as Hamas, a terrorist organization, all in the name of intersectionality.

It is mind-blogging that many progressive activists to this day still refuse to condemn Hamas' rape, torture, and beheading of innocent civilians. Some even go so far as to deny that rape and gender-based violence even took place.

**It shouldn't be difficult to stand with innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians while still condemning Hamas' terrorist attacks.**

If a Christian Copt Terror group in Egypt, started to rape, torture, and behead innocent Muslim civilians in the name of Jesus Christ, you can be sure that these same progressive activists would condemn them.

They would ignore the context of the oppression that the Copt minority has suffered at the hands of Egypt's Muslim majority Government and instead, they would only focus on ""Christians killing Muslims"".

But when Muslims kill Jewish people or Christians, many progressive activists refuse to condemn Hamas all in the name of intersectionality.

186krbt,CMV: hell is a horrible concept morally,"This post goes for anybody who belongs to the abrahamic religions or any other religion that believes in hell 

Many people have made the argument I’m gonna make here against religion but I’m asking it because I’ve never heard a good refutation and it is one of the biggest points of argument for me that these religions are fictional

So hell is universally considered to be a place of eternal torture, involving burning for the unfortunate beings who end up there. This goes on for eternity. Can you imagine what somebody would have to do to you for you to want them to burn *for the rest of eternity*? Our minds can’t even comprehend a timeframe that long. It will never end. Imagine if we kept prisoners alive permanently somehow and kept them in a cell for the rest of the universes existence. And that’s only a cell, that’s not burning them the entire time it’s happening

And worse yet, this doesn’t just go for somebody who mercilessly rapes then murders an innocent child, this goes for me, and most of the people who have ever existed and exist today because we either reject God or worship the wrong one. Why should a Hindu who is born in India and spends their entire lives only knowing Hinduism be tortured for the rest of eternity? Why should an atheist scientist be tortured for the rest of eternity for simply learning about science and realizing that fundamentalist abrahamic religions don’t work well with it? 

This honestly seems like one of the most evil beliefs one can have to me, given that the religious person believes it literally and not metaphorically. I can see believing that people will go to a metaphorical hell for not adopting certain beliefs, though even that I disagree with cause it doesn’t apply to everyone

I’ll give Muslims a bit of leeway for this cause at least, according to what I’ve been told as I was converting to Islam, a persons exposure to the religion is taken into account and for some I guess there is another challenge after they die if they don’t make it to jannah. But even then, many ex Muslims go on to be perfectly decent people so this is still morally reprehensible

For Christians from what I know this is a hard set rule that if you reject Christ, you burn for eternity

186p36m,CMV: a Trump 2024 presidency would irreversibly alter United States politics & partisanship as we know it,"Loaded post, I know and this is a bit heady, but please let me explain. I’m from the Midwest and Trump supporters are everywhere. They frequently claim that Trump is being hit with “political” legal attacks during these court cases. They claim this like they’re saying something outrageous. They also act like Trump wouldn’t do the exact same thing against his opponents, or worse if re-elected. 

First off, obviously the cases against trump are completely political. He’s the former president, and I don’t see any republican plaintiffs. However, when I mention politics, I’m looking past the superficial ideological divide and I’m analyzing the actual mechanics and science behind “power” and mass influence. The study of politics is just that, the discipline studying the application of power and exercise of authority. Any system with more than one individual is political because there will be a power imbalance. There cannot be two chefs cooking the same meal unless one delegates. This is power and its political. 

In my view, systems of power become contentious when you have powerful individuals supported by other powerful people, institutions, or undifferentiated masses. Such as a political party. 

Trump is currently being tried for many different alleged violations, both civil and criminal. Trump was a former and recent president of the United States. This dynamic is completely unprecedented in the balance of Anglo-American politics. Trump could have murdered 3 people with a knife on camera and admitted to it and prosecution of him would still be political. It’s inescapable that the act of exercising government power against trump in the form of judicial oversight is an act of political power. It’s irrelevant how much or how little Biden, or any democrat, has to do with any prosecution. Its political no matter what.  Submission to any court and its laws, under any circumstances, is a recognition of political sovereignty. The very act of Trump, an important political figure, being accused and called to answer for his crimes is political. 

Therefore, if Trump somehow wins in 2024, as a felon or otherwise, it is unthinkable that he would be able to restrain himself from challenging the political systems that tried to hold him accountable in the first place. Even if he wanted to restrain himself. Again, it’s politics, if he is in power he will exercise it, his supporters would command him to do so regardless, right? Given the inherent political nature of the proceedings against him, it seems obvious to me that Trump would use government power to do something equally political. 

Since the nation is already in uncharted waters trying to prosecute a former, contentious president, if Trump wins in 2024, there is an incredibly likely chance that Trump would respond in kind and legally prosecute his enemies or otherwise exercise political power in ways unseen in American political history. 

This post is a prediction, one that I feel many Trump supporters are either ignoring or they want it to happen. Either way change my view and make it easier for me to live in TrumpTown and not be so cynical of US politics. Please poke holes in my appraisal of the situation. Please give me a reason to change my view and expect a boring election cycle in 2024. 

TL;DR: Trump is being accused of felonies and other crimes. Political or not, it’s all politics and it’s unthinkable that if re-elected, convict or otherwise, Trump will launch legal actions against his perceived enemies and a dramatic political battle, unprecedented in scope and scale, will erupt if he wins 2024.",Ok-Story-9319,1024,0.7300000190734863,1186,1701263573,2023-11-29 07:12:53,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/186p36m/cmv_a_trump_2024_presidency_would_irreversibly/,11,2023

Even the Catholic Church has to kowtow to religion when the evidence is so incredibly overwhelming that you just make yourself look aggressively unintelligent arguing against it. There would probably still be people that doubt heliocentrism if the church hadn't publicly (and posthumously) apologised to Galileo.

People that believe in the entirely of for example the bible or the quran are just eventually going to be left behind in science, maths, biology and so many other important fields of study. They're almost modern day luddites.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates.

18bcyto,"CMV: The best time to let a child know that they were adopted is at a very young age, not waiting until their teens or 20s to do so.","*Note: All of this assumes, of course, that the child resembles the adopting family closely enough that he/she might have believed/assumed that the parents were the biological parents. If the child is of a different race, then obviously there is no need to have ""the talk"" since the child couldn't possibly not know.*

If a child is told from as early as they can understand that they were adopted (as opposed to the parents being the biological parents) then they will have less adjustment issues. They will have known all along, and it will have been their reality all along.

By contrast, it can be devastating when some well-meaning parents wait until the kid is in the teens or 20s (or even later) to reveal the news that they were adopted. The rationale that is often given is something like, *""Well, we wanted to wait until he/she was of a mature enough old age to understand, to break the news.""*

The problem with waiting that long to break the news is that by that point the kid has long built up a foundation of concrete assumptions - believing all alone that the parents were the real biological parents - and then, when they've lived with that basis/assumption for so long, you suddenly kick out the foundations from underneath them and make them realize that they'd been on the wrong assumption for 16, 17 or 20 years, causing them to question everything.

18bff6l,CMV: I don’t think cops deserve automatic respect.,"I feel like most cops were kids that were bullied in high school, have a chip on their shoulder, and enjoy exercising their authority of everyone else. Everyone who loves cops unconditionally has Stockholm syndrome. I feel that by willingly choosing to do a job that for the most part oppresses people and makes money for the government, you are a terrible person. Oh you accidentally made a right turn when you didn’t see that the no right turn sign was on? Fuck you, pay me, even though you probably can’t afford it. I don’t need some cocky 24 year old with an ego problem to come “save me”. Human being should be able to take care of themselves. A wise man once said “whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward. Whoever cannot take care of himself without that law is both.”

 I have never had a cop speak to me with respect, so why should I respect them? If they really cared about saving lives and protecting people, they would have become a doctor or a paramedic or a fire fighter.

18cacyg,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,"I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating.",wettigingss,403,0.5600000023841858,2949,1701886825,2023-12-06 12:20:25,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18cacyg/cmv_dating_is_objectively_harder_for_men_than_it/,12,2023

First off dreads originate from African regions dating back thousands of years and hold a religious and cultural significance, furthermore Buddhist, Christian and Hindu religions wore dreadlocks. Moving forward in time vikings adopted this hairstyle and at some point through time most cultures/ethnicities used this hairstyle. So dreadlocks aren't just subject to black culture there subject to most if not all cultures.

There is discrimination against East Asians. Some of it is the black on Asian violence you see on TV.  But most of it again is hidden where Indian educators discriminate against East Asians by singling them out in school between Kindergarten and College.

East Asians discriminate against brown people and black people. Some of it is blatant like suspecting black customers of stealing. Most of it is done silently, by purposely avoiding black and brown communities, and they do not get called out in the same way white flight does.

DEI programs at companies are disproportionately run by black executives and focus on BIPOC, a term that has come to exclude brown and East Asian people.

Chinese and Koreans and Japanese are in a three way hate triangle. East Asians look down on Southeast Asians and consider them second class.

I would argue that the 1960s were way more radical than 2023. It was at a time when most student papers were openly Marxist/Communist. 

It was a time when students were taking over academic buildings, burning ROTC centers and literally getting shot.

You also have stuff on the fringes like the Weather Underground.

My student paper here in Michigan feels more like the New York Times. You see good articles, and a lot of stuff about sports.

You can walk around campus and not really see much of anything. It's business as usual.

18enrh2,"CMV: The criticism of Hitler's paintings as ""ugly"" is not based off of the quality of Hitler's art itself, but rather, the critics' dislike of Hitler as a person.","You would be hard pressed to find a single art critic who holds a neutral or positive view of Adolf Hitler's paintings; they near-unanimously criticize his paintings as *ugly, lacking talent, lacking merit,* etc.

Now, whether one likes Hitler's paintings or not is entirely subjective (you can Google them for yourself and see what you think of them. Most of them are sketches or paintings of buildings, architecture, mountains, scenery, etc.) But I can't help but suspect that the real reason Hitler's art is criticized so heavily by art critics is because they are afraid of the political consequences of saying anything remotely positive about it, especially in the era of social media and cancel culture.

To put it another way, if, say, Barack Obama, Greta Thunberg or Martin Luther King Jr. had painted those **exact same** paintings - or if you showed Hitler's paintings to some art critic without that critic knowing who the painter was - I strongly suspect those same art critics would either hold a neutral/noncritical view or be praising the paintings/sketches as *artistic, beautiful, well-drawn,* etc. 

Whether Hitler's paintings are good or not has absolutely nothing to do with him being a genocidal tyrant.

18ff9s9,"CMV: As a person on the autism spectrum, it is valid for someone to not date a person with a disability due to concerns of baggage and burnout associated with dating a person with a disability","So I am a man on the autism spectrum and while I never had a woman reject me because of my diagnosis, I know that there are some women who do not want to date a man with a disability *that has nothing to do with societal prejudices and biases against people with disabilities*. Now there are people on YouTube who made videos back in 2016 stating that if you are not attracted to or do not want to date a minority because of something related to their status as a member of a minority group, then you are somehow hold prejudiced views against that group of people and have implicit biases instilled from a society that doesn't fully embrace diversity and inclusion.

&#x200B;

Now while I concede that there are **some** people who never want to date a person with a disability either out of implicit biases from an ableist society or the person outright hates people with disabilities, most people who do not want to date a person with a disability do so because they do not want to be burdened with the hassle of caring for a person with a disability.

Disabilities come in all forms and can be physical, mental, or both. Being in a romantic relationship with someone means sharing your life with another person and when it comes to disability, that often means the able-bodied partner is adversely impacted by their disabled partner's disability. Some people do not want to deal with the baggage of being a partner and a caregiver for a person with a disability, or having to deal with social awkwardness, communication issues, and mental health problems. Now, there are some nice people out there who do not mind dating a person with a disability, even if it means being a caregiver and having to live with their partner's disability. 

That said, there are some SJWs (social justice warriors) who feel the need to shame people and call them ""ableist"" for not wanting to date a person with a disability. Dating is a personal choice and nobody is entitled to a date, regardless of what minority group they are part of. Being a caregiver for a person with a disability can lead to ""caregiver burnout"" and anxiety. Those are valid concerns and reasons not to date a person with a disability. I know it is not fair that some people do not want to date me because of my autism, but it's their prerogative and I would rather find someone who is fully willing to date me despite my quirks than deal with someone who is being a poor partner and is dating me out of fear of being called a bigot and being canceled on social media for having ""ableist dating preferences"".

Again, there are always haters who choose not to date people with disabilities out of outright hate, but not all people are like that. Concerns about caregiver fatigue and the time spent caring for a person with a disability is a valid point not to date a person with a disability that has no basis in ableism and bigotry.",Prudent-Reporter-400,396,0.8600000143051147,191,1702247380,2023-12-10 16:29:40,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ff9s9/cmv_as_a_person_on_the_autism_spectrum_it_is/,12,2023
18ffduw,CMV: Afrocentrism is a growing problem that needs to be publicly addressed in the school system,"Particularly African-Americans, I’m seeing this start to pop up all over my social media and real life. I understand where African-Americans come from when they say they weren’t taught about African history, empires, and world changing events, so they feel left behind when compared to how other societies and empires are taught in America; particularly Britain, Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and the Aztecs even, but this Afrocentrist idea of “they were all black before the modern people invaded and stole from our black ancestors” is becoming increasingly problematic social media issue and seeping over into real life. 

This all may seem out of the blue but as an Italian man, I’ve been seeing that “the original Italians were black” popping up across my feed, after seeing countless “the Greeks were black”, “the Egyptians were black”, “the Chinese were black”, “native Americans were black”. 

After getting into the classic instagram comment argument, the common argument is that, at least for European people and societies like the Greeks, Italians, and even the British; claiming that since Western Hunter Gatherers were darker skinned people than modern European populations, that these African-Americans can claim these people and societies as their own despite not being genetically, linguistically, culturally, historically related to them in anyway.

To sum it up. I think that this needs to be addressed either by better education on who these people, societies, and empires were and their modern descendants, and that sub-Saharan societies, people, and empires need to be better taught in the American educational system to combat against “claiming the next best thing as our own since we don’t know our own”.

18fx9i0,"CMV: Biden / Dems have failed immensely by not raising taxes on the wealthy, which would be beneficial to the United States economy","Dems campaign heavily on taxing the ""rich"" and reducing wealth disparity.  However we have seen basically none of that.  I think taxing the rich would reduce wealth disparity, reduce inflation, and lower the deficit, and would be overall a boon to the US economy at large, and that Dems have totally failed to implement any laws to do this in spite of their promises to do just that.

I am not necessarily talking about anything like the 90% taxes like we've seen historically, or even necessarily a ""wealth"" tax.  Even something like increasing capital gains tax to match income taxes would be reasonable, and increasing the top brackets / creating new brackets for people making 10s of millions.

To clarify my points: taxing the wealthy:

A. Would reduce the deficit

B. Would reduce inflation without taxing the poor/middle class

C. Would reduce wealth disparity and many of the negative symptoms of it

D. Could be implemented in a reasonable, measured way

E. Is something the Dems have routinely promised and failed to deliver, and these days they fail to even bring up the topic

F. Fiscal policy is extremely important and the Dems are at best clowns and at worst immoral in failing to address it.

At the risk of getting away from the subject, I would also argue that many of the topics Dems focus on pale in comparison to the importance of good fiscal policy, and Dems pander with social issues instead of fixing economic issues that would have magnitudes higher benefit to the poor and middle class they claim to champion.

I would also argue Trump failed by slashing taxes during a booming economy prior to the pandemic.  The Republicans are obviously don't even pretend to want to raise taxes on the wealthy, which is why I didn't bring them up.

18fx9zx,"CMV: If switching the gender/race/any demographic group in a statement makes that statement sound bigoted, then it was bigoted in the first place. Always.","EDIT: I was wrong to use the word ""sound"" in the title. I meant to make it more understandable, but it detracts from my point. Let me rephrase: If switching the demographic group makes it bigoted, then it was bigoted before the switching too. I used ""sound"" because a lot of people can instinctively recognize some forms of bigotry as bigotry but are blind to the exact same reasoning with just a different demographic group swapped in. I used ""sound"" because, these people blind to bigotry again some groups, they will think ""hey, if you switch the demographic groups, it SOUNDS like bigotry"". As a matter of fact, it IS factually bigoted in both scenarios, both before and after the switching - the ""sound"" was purely relating to the ability of people to recognize bigotry as what it is.


For context, I am a gay, black, Senegalese man. I was born and raised in Senegal, then went to university in France and now I live and work in the USA. The observations that follow have all been made in the USA or online in US-centric spaces.

I have personally witnessed a staggering number of times when someone makes a statement that, if made about women/queer folk/PoC, would be decried as abhorrent and bigoted, but since it's made towards men/straight folks/white people is considered ok, even funny and ""progressive"". There is a whole genre of ""humor"" (and multiple big subreddits dedicated to it) about mocking heterosexual people; I have seen PoCs straight up saying that the opinion of a white person is invalid purely because they are white, etc. Generally, those attitudes seem to come from an utter lack of empathy towards those demographics and every time I see it, I cannot stop thinking that the ""progressive"" people acting in this hateful and discriminatory way would themselves happily be MAGA if they weren't themselves PoCs, queer or women. It is the exact same mindset, casual cruelty and refusal to see ""the other"" as a human being that I see in the worst ""traditional bigots"", just with the demographics switched around.

To get ahead of people pointing out systemic disadvantages: Yes, I know that, in the US of A, white people have more institutional power, men are generally better paid and better considered in the workplace, and het people's human rights are largely secure compared to queer people's rights. All of that is correct. However:

- It does not excuse interpersonal hatred or discrimination. Plainly, if you are hateful towards someone you do not know purely because of their birth-assigned characteristics, you are a profoundly terrible human being, NO MATTER what systemic forces are in place. To use a fictional example that won't lead to people jumping at my throat while refusing all rational discussion: Take Scar from the anime Fullmetal Alchemist. He is a survivor from Ishval, member of a racial minority that was slaughtered by the richer Amestrians. Scar's reaction is to go on a murderous rampage during which he kills, among many others, two innocent Amestrian doctors who were healing Ishvalans on the battlefield, then he tries to murder their even-more-innocent underage daughter. Just because they have blonde hair, which is a sign of Amestrians. Scar associates the entire demographic group with evil people (due to trauma, and he has every reason to), yet his blind hatred of all Amestrians IS wrong, because there are many innocent Amestrians.

- The systemic issues present in the USA are really only present in the USA. I have lived on three different continents, including Africa. I have been told time and time again that ""white people have all the power everywhere"" and that ""there is not one place where PoC are systematically advantaged."" I am strongly convinced that those arguments are born from extreme ethnocentrism from Americans who are not even aware that there exists a world outside of the USA. In MOST countries in the world, white people are a minority, and while they are often seen as a ""model minority"", they don't have more power in my native Senegal or in China or Japan or India than Asian-Americans have in the USA.

- The systemic issues in question, even if only look within the USA, were not born by accident. They are the result of the fact *the majority of the population held bigoted beliefs* for long enough for those beliefs to become ""mainstream"". That's really all it takes. If the ""white people are all trash"" and ""kill all men"" mentalities were to become more popular, they WOULD absolutely shift the systemic imbalances to cause systemic discriminations against white people and men respectively. I'd argue that, on a small scale and in some specific contexts, this is already happen.

I think this was a silly protest, who was going to change there mind about what they were going to do having already driven there and paid for parking and possibly already bought tickets. 

The COVID protesters were another big example to me, like who believed that a few angry people hanging out on a street corner were going to stop state level vaccine mandates. The mandates decreased over time because that is how they are supposed to work and people screaming at street corners were like toddlers through a tantrum for attention.

Last and I think the worst is some of the current environmental protest. Closing a road or gluing yourself to a highway will not stop massive multinational corporations from doing business.

18h1wdx,cmv: I am against all Religious states- Separation of Church and State is essential,"The separation of Church and State is not an attack on religious beliefs but a safeguard for the diverse and pluralistic nature of modern societies- Countries should NOT alter or add laws to cater for any religious beliefs.   


Mandating secular governance, especially in the context of religious law, protects individual rights, and is necessary in society. Any religious  law is based on the interpretation of religious scriptures. Governments cannot be founded on a subjective belief. The lack of a standardization in interpretations is bound to result in ambiguity and inconsistency in legal rulings, making it impossible to establish a cohesive legal framework.   
Mandating adherence to a specific belief inherently restricts peoples agency and free choice. Every individual should have the autonomy to form their own beliefs, values, and moral convictions without coercion from the state.

18hsqgi,CMV: Bitcoin is a Ponzi and currency for questionable purchases and any promised utility is only used to inflate its price.,"I’m all for blockchain technology. I think it’s neat and I do understand crypto, I’ve been using Bitcoin since 2010, and I have researched all of it almost obsessively during the Covid bull run and ultimately keep coming back to the same conclusion.

Bitcoin is worthless.

Sure, some countries with unhinged leaders are trying to switch to it, and yes, it does help some people in Africa who don’t have banking access still have a currency to use, but those are extremely niche examples and don’t work well with something as volatile as Bitcoin in the long run.

It’s also incredibly deflationary by nature which only sounds good in theory but every lost wallet is just Bitcoin that is removed from the supply forever. No one can add more Bitcoin to the network to stimulate any type of economic growth.

The network is slow and relies on WAY too much energy to run. It’s impractical for day to day purchases and it can’t be a real currency until everyone accepts it, which is highly speculative.

As a worldwide store of value, the entire world would have to agree that it is worth something. I agree it’s easier to store than gold but it’s still reliant on a functioning network to run. If some apocalyptic event knocks out the grid, your bitcoin will still technically be there, but accessing it or trading it will be impossible.

You can use it to buy questionable shit on the internet, but that’s about the only purpose it ever had for me.

Every single crypto investor is doing it for one reason. They think it’ll make them rich. Which means they are buying it now, to sell to someone for more later. That makes it a Ponzi. Eventually someone is going to get stuck with the hot potato.

Big institutions are buying up the lions share of it. People like Michael Saylor and the Winklevoss Twins will be trillionaires if it actually takes off and everyone will have scraps of scraps. That’s not the economic equalizer. That’s the same wealth hoarding we already have amplified by a million.

My theory is big institutions are making their bitcoin plays and creating hype just so they can cash out on retail investors leaving the casuals high and dry. Or just keeping it going forever as a Ponzi they can manipulate whenever they need to generate wealth for themselves.",donniedenier,349,0.7599999904632568,445,1702505587,2023-12-13 16:13:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18hsqgi/cmv_bitcoin_is_a_ponzi_and_currency_for/,12,2023

While not *real* children, the designs for these children are clearly and undeniably derivative from real life human children. I.e. Kobato Hasegawa, a popular loli that has a very clear child’s body proportions and behavior. 

This is why anyone, even someone who doesn’t watch anime, can watch a lolicon anime and recognize that these characters are human, and which characters are children - without having to be told. 

It’s visually apparent to everyone because it clearly derives from real human children and everyone knows what that looks like. 

The sole defining characteristic of the genre is the sexualization of specifically prepubescent girls. The fact that this aspect is the defining feature of the genre is because prepubescent anime girls make loli fans aroused. As I have shown that lolis are based off and designed to resemble human children, this is pedophilic. 

Their is no good reason to be turned on by prepubescent girls, and just because it’s a drawing does not mean they don’t represent pedophilic fantasies.",HeartOfCoald,705,0.8500000238418579,469,1702746950,2023-12-16 11:15:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18jvs4y/cmv_lolicon_is_rooted_in_pedophilic_fantasies/,12,2023
18kajht,CMV: Blaming Bad Policy On 'White Men' Is Wrong And Politically Stupid,"I've been mulling over a topic [after reading it here](https://www.nationalmemo.com/ken-paxton-2666596245) and I think deserves our attention: the counterproductive and politically naive trend of blaming complex societal issues solely on 'white men'. This isn't just about being politically correct; it's about understanding the deeper, nuanced factors that contribute to policy decisions and societal changes.  
  
Consider this: Blaming 'white men' as a homogenous group for the challenges in reproductive rights or other social issues oversimplifies the problem and alienates potential allies. It's essential to remember that characteristics like gender, race, and age aren't opinions or ideologies. Yet, we often see this generalization, especially in certain left-leaning circles and media. For instance, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski repeatedly criticized Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, focusing on his race and age rather than his actions or policies.  
  
Let's take a step back and think about this. When we reduce individuals to just their physical attributes, we miss out on engaging in more meaningful, policy-focused discussions. It's easy to forget that people of all backgrounds can hold a variety of views. Texas Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar, for example, votes against abortion rights. Would it be fair or accurate to reduce his stance to his ethnicity? Certainly not.  
  
This trend isn't just unhelpful; it's politically harmful. By alienating groups, we risk pushing them towards opposing political agendas that may not align with their interests. Remember, the Supreme Court justices who established Roe v. Wade were predominantly white men. It’s about perspectives and policies, not just physical attributes.  
  
Moreover, this kind of rhetoric can be easily weaponized by political opponents. When we engage in this oversimplification, we inadvertently provide ammunition for figures like Donald Trump to rally against us, further polarizing the political landscape.  
  
So, what should we do? It's crucial to focus on policies, actions, and ideologies rather than resorting to broad, unhelpful stereotypes. Complex issues demand complex discussions, not reductive blame games.  
  
What are your thoughts on this? Have you noticed this trend, and how do you think we can shift the conversation to be more inclusive and productive?  
  
Looking forward to your insights and discussions!

18kj9d0,"CMV: We should spend more time helping people who are poor, than obsessing over race & identity.","By ‘poor’, I am encompassing anyone who is struggling, or living hand to mouth right now. Mainly for the sake of brevity. 

For the past 10 years the rhetorical focus of governments, charities and corporations alike has been on race/gender/sexuality. And poverty has taken a back seat in the conversation.

A cynic might point out that ‘fighting’ some amorphous spectre of ‘racism’ with a few D&I schemes is much cheaper for the Goldman & Sachs’ of the world than actually trying to solve wealth inequality.

The best argument for the focus on race has been to look at outcomes. Minorities tend to have disproportionately worse health care outcomes, education, incarceration etc. 

But in the U.K. at least, when you control for socioeconomics, these outcome gaps disappear almost completely. With white children even fairing worse than minorities with respect to education outcomes.

It would seem that the racial inequality we see today is largely the result of wealth inequality, rather than deliberate racism - institutional or individual.

Instead of focusing on helping the poor, we spend our time teaching wealthy kids they are ‘oppressed’ because of the identity group they belong to. Creating a atmosphere of paranoia, assuming every other person is a secret racist/bigot. 

By focusing on wealth inequality not only would we materially help the same minorities we want to support (as they are status more likely to fall into that bracket). But we would also help millions of white families who are struggling, and reduce social division.",Fando1234,762,0.8199999928474426,353,1702825593,2023-12-17 09:06:33,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18kj9d0/cmv_we_should_spend_more_time_helping_people_who/,12,2023

18lnxlf,CMV: Incels cannot influence movie box office numbers and cause flops in the way that is constantly claimed on social media,"I want to start by saying that I completely understand that incels exist, and that they can cause many issues for everyone; not just for the women they target, but also for men that get in their crosshairs.

One aspect where I am not believing that they have any meaningful influence as portrayed on social media: **movies and box office numbers**. Every time a movie comes out with a female lead and/or majority female cast, or a ""diversity casting"" as they constantly complain, if that movie flops, you have people screaming ""incels didn't watch the movie because they are scared of women, so of course it became a box office flop! But it's a great movie!"". If a movie is cast with a male lead and it flops, we usually do not hear the same rage from social media that ""<insert group name> did not like this movie because <reasons> and that's why it flopped"", as compared to when incels are brought up.

We have had some stellar box office numbers from female-led movies (e.g. Barbie, great film, loved it) and we've had some flops (from both male and female actors). Notable recent flop that made me want to bring this up: The Marvels. I saw the movie in the cinema when it first came out, really enjoyed it, but it was not a packed room on the opening weekend. Every time someone brings up ""incels are to blame!"" I usually answer ""why didn't women go to watch this movie since they want to support women in movies so much?"". Zero meaningful opposite responses, every time. The movie had decent Rotten Tomatoes scores, and was reviewed mostly positively elsewhere.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe that the number of incels that exist, that can influence movie box office numbers, is a statistically meaningful number. Not men in relationships (since incels are not in relationships), just incels that get constantly blamed for movies flopping. Even if incels complain on social media to try to ruin a movie by review-bombing it, it is pretty obvious when that happens; I have yet to see proof that review-bombing even works with these box office flops.",sinayion,608,0.8199999928474426,446,1702944720,2023-12-18 18:12:00,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18lnxlf/cmv_incels_cannot_influence_movie_box_office/,12,2023
18m9szu,"CMV: If trump wins it won't be the fault of the left or of young people for not voting, it will be the fault of moderate liberals and centrists for choosing bad candidates in the primaries.","1.  The left and the youth always get blamed whenever republicans win but most if not all of the time it's because moderates force through corporate democrats under the guise of ""electability"" even when that claim is verifiably false (ie: bernie being a stronger head to head matchup against trump than biden was in the polls) even against the complaints of the same people they always accuse of not turning out to vote.
If they want those groups to vote they need to be willing to make a sacrifice and support legitimately good candidates in the primaries even if it makes them uncomfortable, ""vote blue no matter who"" can't just be a slogan to browbeat the left with, it cuts both ways, they need to suck it up and vote blue no matter who even if that blue is a leftist candidate. The best way to get the leftists in your party to show up for the election is to be willing to compromise and support a candidate they can actually get excited about.

2. There is a disparity of motive between the moderates and the left. The left has legitimate moral reason to hate the candidates moderates push through the primaries due to the massive harm and loss of life their foreign policy inflicts upon helpless people abroad as well as the concessions they make to corporations, this is especially prevalent this election cycle with biden overtly funding and vocally supporting the genocide of the Palestinian people in gaza as well as admitting that he himself is a zionist, zionism being an inherently imperialist/fascistic ideology which supports the creation and expansion of an ethnostate.
The moderates however, have no such moral complaints against left leaning candidates and instead base most of their complaints in emotion and fear; making vague statements about them being ""too far left"" or ""not electable enough"" and repeating talking points from McCarthyism/the red scare which have no backing or basis in reality especially seeing as leftist candidates tend to support policies that have much broader appeal than the moderates do on a policy by policy basis and often fare better in direct match-ups against the opposition. This has been proven in real world scenarios as well with left leaning candidates winning in deep red states against republican candidates where the democratic party routinely takes losses when putting forth centrist/corporatist candidates. Essentially the left has a legitimate moral justification whereas moderates are acting out of fear and discomfort and tend to push through candidates that make them feel comfortable even if those candidates are monstrous human beings who shouldn't be allowed anywhere near power.

3. Moderates in the democratic voter base have forced this choice on the left for decades and it always results in a back and forth fight with the party in power switching every few years as things slowly get worse. Whereas in those locations where further left leaning candidates win, those areas tend to stay blue much longer as a result of the people living there seeing the positive effect of the policies left leaning candidates put into place.


4. All this to say that If moderates want to actually win elections, they need to stop supporting candidates that are widely unliked by both sides of the political spectrum and stop blaming ""the left"" when it is observably their fault that this is happening. ""The left"" can't be logically blamed when their candidates are consistently more successful when given the chance in real elections. It's moderates that are costing us elections and it's moderates that will be at fault for the US slipping into a full blown fascist dictatorship if they hand the presidency to trump by putting forth a nominee nobody likes.


Things that won't change my mind:

1. ***""It's actually conservatives fault""*** Yeah, sure I agree, they're bad people and ultimately to blame, but it's a waste of time and effort to try and change their minds. We should focus on groups that actually can change. Those are leftists and moderates and of the two moderates don't have a real justification for continuing to impose their bs on others.

2. ***""but biden did (insert good thing here)""*** Biden/any centrist doing good things on occasion, or even often does not outweigh the lives they take with their foreign policy and it certainly doesn't outweigh outright genocide.

3. Appealing to me personally to vote for him. This isn't about my vote; it's about how if he loses I won't blame leftists/the youth, I'll blame moderates who constantly saddle us with unappealing nominees that are so bad it's more surprising when they win than when they lose.

4. ***""biden doesn't actually have control over what happens in gaza/biden is already trying to stop it""*** This one I've heard a lot recently and the first part is dubious at best, israel could not do what it does without the funding the US gives it and biden has control over that the second part is easily disproven with his own words and actions.",Aberration-13,854,0.6499999761581421,2186,1703013121,2023-12-19 13:12:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18m9szu/cmv_if_trump_wins_it_wont_be_the_fault_of_the/,12,2023

18nxu13,CMV: The concept of cultural appropriation is very toxic since it prevents religious and cultural innovation much like intellectual property,"When I mentioned that I (a gentile) read the Zohar to see if I could learn something from it. I received about a dozen death threats from Jews and Native Americans claiming that Gentiles could not practice Kabbalah since it was cultural appropriation. I think this behavior is very wrong, and if it is successful it will make people see the group as uninteresting and dangerous.   
  
Uninteresting and dangerous is not what a cultural group should be aiming to be perceived as. This makes it a lot easier to dehumanize such a group. In fact I'd even go as far as to say cultural appropriation mobs are actively inviting dehumanization. I believe there is a sizeable portion of the population who would as an outsider perceive Judaism and Jewish people positively and defend Jewish people from antisemitism, but after receiving enough death threats from Jewish people over their expressed interest in Judaism would no longer act to prevent a hate crime or worse.  
  
I don't think this behavior would ever turn someone into a raving antisemite, but I do think it will make people indifferent to the plight of Jewish people, or any other ethnic group which engages in this behavior. It is basically soft power suicide.  
  
I think the most reasonable position is to treat this issue like intellectual property today. Jews should not be able to do a DMCA takedown on all of Christianity and Islam for the Old Testament, and Jewish literature that is legally considered in the public domain should be considered socially acceptable for anyone to read. The Zohar is either from 1240, or the second century, either way it is in public domain at this point.  
  
Most Kabbalistic literature is in the public domain.  I think people should be able to read it freely and learn what they please from it. Not saying all Jewish people need to be happy about it, but I think they should accept it on the basis that these books are out in the public, and accepting people reading them is a worthwhile soft power tradeoff.  
  
I do believe however that using names and titles that may cause brand confusion is more of a problem, and this may apply to some extent to symbols and iconography. I consider Qabalah and Cabala as sufficiently differentiated terms due to their centuries of historical usage outside of Judaism, but a gentile claiming to practice Kabbalah might be something that is worthy of civil lawsuits or criminal charges. Kabbalah Centre is a bit weird because it is Jewish-run, so I don't think it could reasonably be called cultural appropriation. However things like deity names should not count in this since they are deities not brand names.  
  
Likewise, I think this applies to other groups too. People should be free to read public domain books on Native American religion and learn from them. If a white person wants to worship Quetzalcoatl they should be free to do so and not face criminal charges or death threats, but they should not be able to say they are practicing ""Aztec religion"" since they are not Nahua, they are just a white person worshipping a common deity.   
  
I believe this cultural influence leads to long lasting soft power, as even if the ideas are quite transformed, their cultural presence will lead people towards respecting the culture they originated in, even if it sometimes doesn't immediately translate into the short term.

This also limits the ability of new cultural and religious practices to be developed which is detrimental to society as a whole. We should want a dynamic culture that develops new ideas, and enforcing strict ownership rules over cultural ideas is harmful to this.",their-holiness,403,0.7699999809265137,326,1703194099,2023-12-21 15:28:19,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18nxu13/cmv_the_concept_of_cultural_appropriation_is_very/,12,2023
18o0ha9,"CMV: Censoring a non-crude word pertaining to a difficult subject, like 'rape', is ridiculous and a category error.","I very recently saw an infographic about abortion laws in Europe by country, describing the permissibility of abortion and in which circumstances. It was a broadly informative or at least serious and non-frivolous infographic. And yet the word 'rape' was censored to 'r\*pe' in the legend -- in the context of 'abortions allowed in case of rape'.  
  
This is very far from the first time I've seen this sort of thing; in fact, it seems to be everywhere these days, and I'm mystified by it. What is going on with the censoring of normal words that pertain to difficult subjects? And how has it gotten to the point that in informational charts that's seen as an acceptable thing to do?  
  
I understand censoring words deemed to be crude or offensive, like 'fuck'. I understand as well that if I were writing a blog post and I thought my audience might be triggered by difficult concepts, I might give a trigger warning that rape will be discussed.  
  
I don't understand in the least who is being served by censoring the word itself. The word 'rape' is not a bad word. Rape, of course, is abominable. But the word 'rape' is not -- i.e, it's not impolite or crude to say the word.  
  
I see this all over the place now, but only very selectively applied. You never see 'murder' censored to 'm\*rder' or something, though I'm sure we all agree murder is abominable as well.  
  
And if the idea is indeed to censor the word so as to avoid someone being 'triggered' by it in some way -- well, censoring one letter of it won't achieve that at all, will it?  
  
There seems to be a category error going on, in which people are **censoring** the normal and accurate word in lieu of **censuring** a very terrible act. But that's completely bonkers, in addition to being infantilizing!

There's a real danger to the idea that one ought to censor a word pertaining to a difficult topic, instead of censoring crude words meant to degrade or be offensive. 'Rape' is not a word meant to degrade or be offensive (though of course the act is infinitely offensive -- obviously no argument there); instead, the word is a normal, accurate descriptor used up to and including in legal terminology to describe a heinous act. Censoring such a word is madness, not least because if it becomes the norm to do so, one might well be censured themselves for using the word uncensored. What irony.

18p9saa,"CMV: If you are an ugly woman (like myself), you will not have it easy in society, and will have to make up for it in different ways","It is often said that men have lower standards than women, and that women don't have as much to worry about when dating. Growing up I've always heard that men have it harder because nobody will take of them, whereas men will almost always take care of woman (regardless of traits, employment, income).

Which I do mostly agree with, until looks are mentioned. Most men will not date, love, or take care of a woman they consider to be ugly. Being traditionally feminine, showing vulnerability, anxiousness, or being shy is are traits that are not afforded to me or other women who are considered 'ugly'.

In my personal experience, men have always treated me as if I were invisible or nothing. I have been called ugly, made fun of, and many guys have played me.

Furthermore, I've found that I've had to make up for where I lack in looks with bettering myself as a person. Raising my self esteem, not being sensitive/developing a thick skin, being more blunt, and being aloof. I also fully acknowledge that these changes will not guarantee that I will find love, as many of these traits don't matter to men at all.

18q5tdv,CMV: The Romani Holocaust organised by Nazi Germany is not talked about nearly as much as it should,"Alongside Jews, the [Romani people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people) were treated as sub-humans. As a result, they were persecuted and put into death camps the way Jews were under Nazi rule. It's estimated that [250,000 to 500,000 Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_Holocaust) were murdered, about 25-50% of the Romani population at the time. A scholar even estimated that 1.5 million Romani might have died out of a population of 2 million. 

I did not learn about this until recent months, and I'm sure many reading this post aren't aware either. Their Holocaust was only recognised by West Germany in 1982, and many official recognitions only came about in the 2000s. The reason for that is complicated but probably due to a combination of strong anti-Roma racism in Europe, especially Eastern Europe, the lack of collective memory and the lack of documentation.

I think that every time we talk about the Holocaust, we need to recognise that it's not only the Jewish people that were genocided, the Romani people were too and need to be addressed together.",GoSouthCourt,874,0.8600000143051147,273,1703458272,2023-12-24 16:51:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18q5tdv/cmv_the_romani_holocaust_organised_by_nazi/,12,2023

I have also tried doing these things without making other people feel excluded and explaining ideas in a simple manner, but seems like most people just care about surface level discussions and somehow think discussing anything in depth makes you a pretentious narcissist.  
And this is not just limited to personal experience. In most scenarios, people club anyone bringing up anything remotely intelligent as pretentious and feel the need to one up the person by clubbing him/her into categories like r/iamverysmart or something similar. Its such a disgrace. I also feel like this stems from an anti-elitist mentality but even that is harmful for us as it hinders innovation and lateral thinking.  


However I agree that I may be wrong, so please feel free to give reasons as to why this kind of behavior is justified.

18qsasj,"CMV: The Israeli settlements are illegal and unjustified, and the USA should condemn Israel for it","In the Geneva Convention, it's illegal to transfer your own civilians to occupied territory, stating that ""the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies."". In a [document](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-199015/) prepared by the UN in 1999, it says:


>Article 49 of the 4th Geneva Convention is very specific in its reference to settlers or civilians of the occupying Power and states explicitly that ""the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. ""This article prohibits settlements in broad and unequivocal terms without regard to the purported purposes of the settlements and was created specifically to prevent the colonization that inevitably ensues with such population transfers

The General Assembly, including the UK and many in the West, has condemned the illegality of these settlements numerous times, the Security Council [passed a resolution](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/1696?ln=en) in 1979 declaring that these settlements have no legal validity, and the ICJ has [ruled](https://web.archive.org/web/20200913105418/https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/131/131-20040709-ADV-01-00-EN.pdf) that the settlements violate international law, rendering them illegal. 

If anyone wants to argue that the West Bank is not occupied territory, both ICJ and [UNSC](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/SCRes242%281967%29.pdf) have ruled territories East of the Green Line to be occupied territory, and the rulings in the paragraph above presupposes West Bank as occupied territories too.

There is also [settler violence](https://www.btselem.org/topic/settler_violence) that Israel has failed to properly address, [doubly illegal settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_outpost) (illegal in Israeli law and international law) are not removed promptly and sometimes protected by the IDF. 

These are all unjustified because they come at the expense of Palestinians, forcing them into an apartheid-like state, an obstacle for peace (as described by the US), and often leads to unnecessary arrests of Palestinians for retaliating against settler violence.

If the USA doesn't want to be hypocritical, they must unequivocally condemn Israel for illegal settlements, just as many countries in the West have done. It's not like it will hinder their ability to send military aid to Israel anyway because the UK have also made military deals with Israel.

Edit: To clarify, declaring something illegal is not the same as condemning. Looking at the annexation of Crimea, many non-align countries declare the annexation and referendum illegal, or saying Ukraine's territorial integrity must be respected, but stop short of condemning Russia for it, because condemnation means something in diplomacy. If US condemns Israel tomorrow, for literally anything, it will permanently shift US-Israel relation because US has crossed a line that Israel didn't think they would cross.",GoSouthCourt,352,0.6399999856948853,435,1703542046,2023-12-25 16:07:26,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18qsasj/cmv_the_israeli_settlements_are_illegal_and/,12,2023
18rjb74,Cmv: One of the worst things that could happen to a person is being born in a third world country.,"So I’m from Nigeria and I moved to the USA years ago with my father and based on my experiences I believe living in a third world country is one of the worst things to happen to a person. I’ve seen how much my parents have sacrificed just to be in this country. I know how much money my father has paid to get us papers in the United States. I honestly couldn’t even believe he had spent that much money. My dad studied industrial engineering in Nigeria and it didn’t even help him in the United States because most employers see that degree as worthless because he got it in a Nigerian university. He never studied here and so now he has to settle for low wage jobs. My dad works so hard, six days a week and we basically live paycheck to paycheck. It’s tough ngl. I just feel like our lives as a whole would be so much better and stress free if not for the fact that we were born in Nigeria, can see our country falling apart and so now we were forced to make this hard journey here. I was also in Nigeria this summer and the country is rife with so much poverty. This are getting worse every day and the basic amenities I enjoy in the United States are like luxuries over there. While I was in Nigeria, there was a time my electricity went out and we had no electricity for almost an entire day. As a result our water went out and we had to fill up buckets of water at someone else’s house just to be able to wash dishes and flush the toilet. I once spoke to my dad and I asked him “so how does a person in Nigeria live a decent life and fulfill something for themselves” and he told me he doesn’t know. Degrees in Nigeria are almost useless now as there are no jobs whatsoever. 
So in conclusion I feel like being from a third world country is on of the worst things to happen to a person because the struggles of living in one in the first place is stressful,draining and horrible, while the struggles of leaving one is also horrible as you have to endure and sacrifice a lot so either way you will suffer, unless you’re rich I guess.",Various_Beach_7840,1951,0.8999999761581421,743,1703627587,2023-12-26 15:53:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18rjb74/cmv_one_of_the_worst_things_that_could_happen_to/,12,2023
18rl1qx,CMV: It's really weird that the Holocaust has been completely claimed by Jews,"Just a few to things to make 100% clear. I am absolutely not denying that 6 million Jews were killed in an attempt of genocide by Nazi Germany. This is not an attempt to revise the Holocaust or deny any part of it. Quite the opposite, actually. I am also not saying in any way that Jews cannot or should not claim victim hood. They were massively victimized and are still today. These are not part of my point at all.

Something that's been bothering me for a while is that the Holocaust has been broadly accepted and talked about as purely a genocide against Jews. Most people I know who I've talked to about WWII or the Holocaust think that there were only (relatively speaking, of course) 6 million Holocaust victims. This is not true. There were 6 million victims who were Jewish. There was another 5-6 million who were not Jewish, but disabled, LGBT, and non Jewish ethnic/racial minorities. Anyone ""degenerate"" or ""inferior"".

You may be wondering why it matters. Here's why it bothers me:
1. Nearly half of the victims of the Holocaust are practically erased by only focusing on the 6 million Jews. It's not right to suggest 6 million is inflated and it's not right to only speak on half of the victims of the Holocaust, in my view.
2. Fascism of all kinds have similar strategies and talking points, but the Nazis and Hitler gained a special level of hatred among the general population, seemingly globally. Only focusing on the anti-Semitic propaganda and tropes causes us to miss propaganda and tropes of other groups from the same source. This is happening in the US towards several minority groups, but the parallels are ignored because we're not educated on ALL of the trash Nazi Germany pumped out and perpetrated.

To change my view, you need to explain why my concerns are moot and/or that the other 5-6 non Jewish deaths are not as ignored as I feel they are.

Also, I'm an American speaking on what I experience in America and online in mostly American communities. I don't know how Holocaust education or discourse is outside of the US.

Edit: I figured this wouldn't take too long. I had assumed that other groups were treated just as bad as Jews were, but that was incorrect. There's also the fact that the Jewish population is the only group victimized that did not significantly recover from the same event. Also, I didn't realize that ""Holocaust"" is literally a term used for the Jewish deaths exclusively and the other murders are considered separately. These things have changed my view.

This is a large part of the reason why i loved Obama despite not being a democrat. He was the perfect leader. Physically and mentally strong, brilliant and charismatic to a fault. He was a damn near perfect human being, regardless of his policies.

18t5hpd,CMV: Homeschooling should be way more heavily regulated if not outright illegal,"Homeschooling can sound like a good option to some people. Parents know their kids best, and can give their child all the attention they need and not be split among a whole class like a teacher is. That’s the idea at least. But in reality, that is not what happens most of the time. 

In most cases homeschooling is just a way for parents to have complete control over their kids lives and abuse them more easily or indoctrinate them into their own religious/political beliefs. We’ve all heard the horror stories of kids being unschooled and unable to even spell their name even as a 10 or 11 year old. Obviously cases this bad are not common, but the very fact that this is allowed to happen in the system AT ALL is a sign that it needs to be reformed. [Of parents who homeschool 75% say they do so to provide moral instruction. 59% do it to provide religious instruction.](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/tgk/homeschooled-children). Now you can criticize public schooling, but it certainly doesn’t fail to provide a moral backbone to kids or equip them to think critically about their own moral views and expose them to many different ideas. This makes me believe that these parents aren’t dissatisfied with public schools because of good faith criticisms of its curriculum, but because they don’t teach their own religious or political views as fact. Kids are not the property of their parents, they have a right to a good education, not an indoctrination into their parents’ ideas. Homeschooling often does not provide the wide variety of people and worldviews that defines public schooling and creates kids who cannot think for themselves as adults. 

Homeschooling also often fails to provide kids adequate social connections to other children. This is important not just for their own personal growth, but for them to learn what a “normal” childhood is like. It’s a lot easier to believe that parental abuse is normal if you don’t meet many kids who don’t experience it. It’s another form of control given to parents who usually are not trustworthy.  [Parents who engage in child neglect or educational mistreatment are more likely to use homeschooling as a guise.](https://digitalcommons.cwu.edu/source/2013/oralpresentations/137/). 

I am aware that academically homeschool kids tend to do a little better on standardized tests. But this only makes me more concerned, as based on the other data  it seems like parents are teaching for the test and not the actual skills the test is trying to measure. The point of social studies classes is not to know in what year Columbus crossed the ocean, but rather how to think critically about history, parse through information and different sources, and synthesize information to come to their own conclusions. Public school doesn’t do this perfectly, but it is at the very least the goal, unlike homeschooling for many people.

On the other hand, there are a significant minority of homeschooled kids who are due to having special needs, or from having suffered some negative experience at school that makes them feel unsafe. I do think this is a legitimate reason to homeschool, but I’d still like to see these types of kids returned to public school once the system has found better means to teach these kids and prevent abuses.

Ultimately I think this comes back to control. I think homeschooling gives parents way too much control over their kid’s life. Traditionally, kids were raised by and taught by the entire local community. We evolved to learn that way. Modern schools allow for kids to learn from a wide variety of people and curriculums are influenced by the entire community or nation. But homeschooling gives all that power to one or two people, who even at best are flawed human beings with blind spots. If you have a bad teacher at a public school it won’t be long before you’re in a different class with another teacher, and you have some mechanisms to remove that bad teacher. If your homeschool “teacher” is bad, there is almost nothing you can do and they teach every class. That’s just a bad system to put the future of humanity into.",LineOfInquiry,394,0.7099999785423279,430,1703799916,2023-12-28 15:45:16,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18t5hpd/cmv_homeschooling_should_be_way_more_heavily/,12,2023
18t6eoz,Cmv: The majority of people supporting Palestine in the west don't know what they are really supporting.,"I will start out by saying the Palestinians have been mistreated by Israel and surrounding Arab states and need a state but I believe Israel has a right to exist. A 2 state solution which I think is the majority view of people in the west not involved directly in the conflict.

When the college presidents were before Congress being wishy washy about the calls for genocide being a violation of the code of conduct I really believe one of the reasons was to protect there students. With the river to the sea slogan when used in the past and to certain extent today by Palestinians means a call for all Jewish people to be removed from the area and I dont think students really are aware of that so I don't think the majority of them chanting it were actually calling for genocide in their eyes even though through a lot of peoples eyes they were. I don't think students should be exspelled for not understanding the full context of a slogan and I think the college presidents understood that. A lot of students had no idea what river and what sea it was even referring too.

Another big thing I see is the right of return and a call for democratic state where both people live together I personally don't see how this doesn't end horribly for everyone involved if you snapped your fingers and made this a reality tomorrow. Even a structured right of return not overnight would end in escalation in hostility between both groups that would be a net negative for both people in my opinion. This is an amazing dream for well into the future but this is not a reality now. To give an example imagine if Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi people all returned to there homes from before partition and they were all one state do you think that goes well at all? I wish in perfect world it did but that's not the reality. I really don't think a lot of people protesting in the street realize the consequences that full right of return would have with tensions being so high.

My last point is some people portraying Israeli's as white and Palestinians as non white. I think most of the people in general would not be able to pick out who was Palestinian or Israeli in a line up. This I think comes from Americans ideas on race which don't really apply to this conflict and makes me think a lot of people saying this have never actually met a Palestinian or Israeli or even read up or watched anything longer then a Instagram story on it.

They’re wasting time on their phone accomplishing nothing other than increasing their jealousy and anxiety while they can be spending that time being productive. All independence and privacy has gone out the window to oversharing and following meaningless trends. 

TikTok is the worst iteration of this. The algorithm is specifically made to influence young people’s worldview. From the moment you create an account you’re bombarded with dangerous messaging. Gen Z is completely addicted to this, and the platform is now where the youngest generation is receiving their news. Why does China have a different version of TikTok?

18tm874,CMV: Disney Plus will go down as the worst financial decision Disney has ever made.,"In 2019, Disney released a bunch of movies that all did really well in the Box Office, including Avengers Endgame, Frozen 2, Star Wars 9,  Toy Story 4. The 8 highest grossing films in the US/Canada that year were all Disney films. That was done intentionally to bring people's attention to Disney Plus, their new streaming platform. As it grew quarter to quarter, this product did really well over the pandemic. There wasn't much box office revenue either so this streaming platform became an important lifeline for Disney.

Unfortunately, the content Disney was releasing just wasn't good, probably due to a more significant budget constraint. People got tired and exhausted with Disney content, even in their flagship like Marvel. This resulted in 2023, the year of the flops. Disney can only claim financial success in 2 films this year, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and The Little Mermaid. Everything else was a flop. It wouldn't be a surprise if Disney reports a net loss of $1 billion at the box office this year. Their audience is conditioned to watch Disney content on their platform, and worse yet, conditioned to think that all Disney content is bad, in cinemas or not. It's also this year that their subscriber numbers have plateaued, in combination with an announcement to release ad-tier subscriptions and cut content.

I chose not to censor the language partly because despite every other major subreddit that I'm aware of doing so, the mods here do not censor language, something that I view favorably. I also had used these words on this subreddit prior in a similar context (speaking about censorship) in a comment that was well-received. I truly was not expecting the initial reaction I received and I was not trying to offend anybody.

After a conversation with the mods, it would seem the best course of action is to separate my two topics of conversation entirely. I'm still choosing not to censor the language. If my language offends you or makes you uncomfortable, that is indicative of exactly what I am speaking about.

While I'm not one to phone the internet police, the mods here are pretty anal about keeping their threads clean so please keep Rule 1 (top-level comments must challenge my view) and Rule 2 (don't be a dick) in mind in your responses.

There are several replies of mine that can give you a decent idea of where my head's at and you can even bring quotes of mine from that thread in here to use in your replies if you like.

I have been alive to witness at least a bit of the evolution of the word faggot. When I was growing up, it was essentially used synonymously with asshole or douchebag. I remember vividly an interview Eminem gave about the Marshall Mathers LP (2000) when I was 13 in which he said ""When I say 'you faggots keep egging me on' I don't mean 'you gay people keep egging me on'"" and I remember thinking 'I can't believe he just had to explain that.'
 
Now faggot is just as derogatory as nigger and it would seem retard is fast approaching if not there already. There was also backlash against both [Lizzo and Beyonce (and Weird Al!)](https://slate.com/culture/2022/08/beyonce-renaissance-lizzo-spaz-ableist-slur-lyrics-history.html) in recent memory for using the word spaz.

Even this website has evolved. When I first arrived (2013), both faggot and retard were commonly used in various memes, and while I can't remember ever coming across nigger (worth noting that it may have been auto-removed by most subreddits since the site's inception though I can't know that) I do recall people casually throwing around nigga now and then. Now this subreddit itself is the only major subreddit I'm aware of that does not censor language and have all posts that contain any of these words removed automatically.
 
The N-word has been the N-word since I've been alive. I was not present to witness its evolution but I would have to imagine it went through something similar. I never questioned it because for me it had always been part of my established reality. But having now witnessed this evolution happen myself a couple times along with the threat of it continuing to happen more, it does give me cause to question if words evolving to have so much power over us that they're unacceptable in any context and being essentially forcibly removed from our vernacular is the correct direction. Something about it gives me '1984' vibes.",Aggressive-Carob6256,396,0.6800000071525574,530,1703950826,2023-12-30 09:40:26,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18uib7l/cmv_the_rate_at_which_words_evolve_to_be/,12,2023

And I think its kind of true  I've tried experiments. With older profiles and younger ones. I look the same and yet the younger age gets more matches. Its a scary thought that men, no matter how old THEY are dont want older women with experience.

190573g,"CMV: As an Asian American, voting for the Democratic Party is the only viable option for me, as they are the lesser of two evils","As someone deeply engaged in the upcoming election, I remain aligned with the Democratic Party as an Asian American, especially considering I reside in California. This state is the wealthiest in the nation and holds a remarkable economic standing, with a GDP that, if considered independently, would rank among the top 10 globally.

On top of that, the GOP has this habit of throwing around racist remarks, which just doesn't sit right with Asians. It's the kind of stuff that could be used against them, especially when we're talking about the surge in hate crimes against Asians.

While Asians encompass a rich tapestry of ethnic diversity, I want zero in on the ""holy Asian trinity"" (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) due to their numerous and influential representation among the Asian community. Democrats tend to lean towards supporting social safety nets and regulations, and this tends to resonate more with educated minorities.

Education holds immense significance in Asian culture, exemplified by phenomena like cram schools in East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan, where students attend supplementary classes to gain a competitive edge in entrance exams to some of the most competitive colleges in their respective country.

Drawing a comparison within the U.S., states under Republican governance tend to exhibit lower academic achievements than their Democratic counterparts. This discrepancy is often attributed to the Republican Party's inclination to reduce funding for education, resulting in lower academic outcomes.

While there is a consensus that schools could benefit from increased cost efficiency, the solution does not lie in defunding education. 


To change my view:

190cmeb,"CMV: The Democratic Party platform of ""vote for us or lose the right to vote at all"" is not the strong ""saving democracy"" platform that party leadership seems to think it is.","Note: in this post I'm using ""democracy"" to describe any system of government where power is derived from legitimate elections. The debate about whether our representative form of government was ever a true ""democracy"" is another topic entirely.

The US has long had a two-party democratic system. Now, one of the two parties is openly un-democratic. They support a candidate who already attempted one coup to overthrow an election, and who openly wishes to be a dictator. So from my perspective, that party is no longer participating in the democratic process, which leaves us with a... one-party democracy? Is that even a democracy at all?

In 2020 Biden ran on the premise of saving democracy from Trump. Now, entering the next election, democracy seems *even farther* from ""being saved,"" and Biden is running on the same premise again. Frankly, it seems a lot like the rhetoric from self-labeled but widely accepted to be undemocratic regimes like Russia and China; ""you must vote for THE party or doom us all.""

It seems to me that the only way out of this situation is to create a viable third-party (or rather, 2nd party, if you assume that the Republicans are not participating in democracy). If the Democratic Party is serious about ""saving democracy,"" then they should be acknowledging the vast differences between their constituents (currently, anyone who still wants the US to operate as a democracy), dividing themselves into factions (sub-parties or new parties altogether), and forming a coalition of those factions to elect leaders through a democratic process (e.g. serious primary elections for president).

Is there something I'm missing?

190eajj,"CMV: Anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic, though both Zionists and Anti-Zionists can be antisemitic","From the Jewish Virtual Library, Zionism is defined as the national movement for the return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. It is NOT just the self-determination of the Jewish people. To disagree with Zionism is not to deny Jewish people of their right to self-determination, but to resist the maintenance of **Jewish sovereignty** in **Israel** and maybe Palestine depending on which form of Zionism one is talking about.

It's not anti-Kurdish to say that Kurds shouldn't have their own state, or anti-Scot to say Scots shouldn't be independent in Scotland, or anti-Roma to say that Roma shouldn't be granted a state. Therefore it is not antisemitic to say that the Jewish people shouldn't have their own state. If, however, Zionism is PURELY the self-determination of the Jewish people, then anti-Zionism can be associated with antisemitism, but that's not what Zionism is.

Furthermore, saying that Jewish people shouldn't have their own state is not the same as saying Israelis shouldn't have their own state, just as saying Whites shouldn't have their own state in England is not the same as saying the English shouldn't have their own state in England. There is a leap of logic that Israeli == Jews for that equivalence to hold true. One can hold anti-Zionist position while believing that Israelis living in modern-day Israel deserve a state, which is also my position.

On top of that, it's not antisemitic to say that a people shouldn't have inherent sovereignty in a country. If someone says ""There should be White or Black sovereignty in America"", you are not a racist to criticise that person.

Lastly, no group is entitled to return to their homeland. Americans of German descent are not entitled to anything in Germany, the Romani people are not entitled to anything in northwest India. Chinese diaspora in Singapore are not entitled to anything in China. Singaporean Chinese can't just move to ShenZhen and start claiming the city belongs to them. I am not anti-German, anti-Roma, anti-Chinese for pointing all of these out, so why am I antisemitic for pointing this in Zionism out?

With that being said, there are anti-Zionists and Zionists that are antisemitic. On one hand, it's not uncommon to hear things like ""Zionists control the media/the bank"", ""Zionists are too rich"", etc. in the anti-Zionist camp, these are antisemitic statements and should be condemned. On the other, many neo-Nazi parties and fundamentalist Christians are vehement supporters of Zionism yet they hold some very antisemitic views.

191zd8y,CMV: Barbie will have a much bigger impact on female lead blockbusters than The Marvels.,"A lot of people point to the marvels as a example of why female lead blockbusters fail and why disney will stop making ""woke content"". I felt this was very far fetched the marvels had a lot going against it. Its the latest in the line of marvel films that were already mediocre its also very generic and paint by numbers. Thor Love and thunder Ant Man Quanamanium and Secret Invasion really destroyed the general audiences desire to see more marvel movies. 

I also don't the Marvels is a particularly ""woke"" movie sure the leads are all women and the villain is a woman but does it have a feminist message or anything particularly to say about the female experience? 

Not really maybe there is that line about ""black girl magic"" but other than that nothing in the movie seemed very offensive to the average male movie goer.

If you contrast that with Barbie that has a explicitly feminist message and said the word ""patriarchy"" which obviously should turn off antifeminist viewers despite all that it was a success.

Now I see disney hiring a basically unknown female feminist female director to make a new star wars movie and I can't help but think they are trying to copy barbies success.

But these parents were the parents who would force their kids to go to church on Sunday, force their kids to read the Bible, force them to pray, force them to go to religious summer camps, shelter them from outside influence, etc. - in many cases, also heavily censoring what their kids were allowed to read or watch. If anything, the upbringing that they raised their kids was even more focused on instilling a certain message or agenda of the parents' preference in the kids' minds than anything the schools did. Somehow all of their raising of their children this way didn't count as ""indoctrination,"" but the schools or media promoting a pro-LGBT message was ""indoctrination.""

192eqb6,"CMV: It is now in men's best interests to stop using dating apps, disconnect from them entirely, and force society to find a new way for people to meet and date.","39M here, FWIW. The culture of dating apps has established itself in such a way that men have arisen as the unequivocal losers in this game, basically like playing a football game where you start being down by multiple scores and it's already the final quarter of the game. 

We all know the statistics: men get about [1 or 2 matches a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/11btxok/men_how_many_matches_do_you_get_a_day/?rdt=52564), across all dating apps. That's going to be roughly equal to the number of LIKES they get since most men are liking the vast majority of profiles they see, a strategy they are probably justified in using since there's no point in being selective with so little working in one's favor. Women, on the other hand, get [hundreds of likes a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/163amr9/how_many_matches_for_women/?rdt=42121), all of which can translate into a match if they so choose. If I conservatively pick the number as 200 matches a month, that means women are having ONE HUNDRED TIMES THE SUCCESS THAT MEN ARE HAVING. One. Hundred.

That's clearly a losing game for men. So why should we continue to participate? Clearly it is in the best interests of men to collectively agree to stop using dating apps, to delete each and every one of them from our phones and, I dunno, at the very least force us to meet people the old-fashioned way, by meeting people at bars, getting set up with a friend of a friend, asking out your cute coworker, etc. These options are all on the table right now, obviously, but a lot of women aren't even leaving themselves open to the opportunity because they know they've got their ace-in-the-hole on a dating app somewhere. So why risk things with your coworker or do the socially awkward thing of approaching that dude at the bar when you can just rely on these dating apps to do the guesswork for you on whether the dude is even available and if he's interested in you?

It's a losing game for men and we men should collectively agree to stop using dating apps completely. Keep in mind that my viewpoint is not so concerned with how FEASIBLE it is to suddenly get all men to stop using dating apps; it's more about what I think would happen if we could snap our fingers and make it happen. But also, I don't consider it to be completely NON-feasible, since generally it is easier to not do something than it is to do something, right? If I can do my part to do my fellow men a favor, of course I will do that, and I think this move right here is in our best interests.

194axin,CMV: It Should Be Illegal for Politicians to Tell Blatant Lies,"This is Trump-inspired. I was just listening to Trump speaking to reporters not five minutes ago after coming out of his civil trial in New York where he has already been found guilty of massively inflating the value of many of his properties and holdings and they are determining what the punishment/fine should be. He stood in front of reporters and stated, time and again, that ""this was the new way Democrats were stealing the elections"" and repeatedly said that all of these trials and charges he is facing are being coordinated by Biden. 

I understand that the news media can rebut these claims and can follow-up his conferences with fact-checks, but I don't think that is sufficient as he is consistently allowed a megaphone in which he can state huge, incredibly damaging lies that hurt our country and there is no reprecussion for doing so. 

I do not believe that politicians should be held liable/that it should be illegal for them to tell lies in that for example, they say they will do ""X"" for their constituents but then that doesn't happen. What I mean is it should be illegal to make such incredibly damaging and damning claims when there is literally no evidence to support it. This is because the types of claims Trump is making are the type that can lead to true disarray, hatred, anger, and potentially even civil war if allowed to carry on unpunished. 

When Trump tells people that Biden is coordinating charges against him when there is literally no evidence of this his supporters believe it. And this type of claim is the type of claim that angers and infuriates his supporters. They truly believe that the election was stolen (even though he had many, many chances in court to prove his claims and failed in every single one) and they truly believe that Biden is somehow coordinating an effort to put Trump behind bars.

The simple fact is, Trump clearly was told by many, many individuals that there was no evidence of fraud in the election but he plowed forward with ""stolen"" claims anyways. He called the Georgia secretary of state and asked him to find just enough votes for him to win. He did all these things and there are consequences. He brought this upon himself, not Biden. 

Why shouldn't it be illegal for candidates to tell these types of lies? In a world where gaslighting the public leads to true national division, can we really continue to allow such dangerous lies to be legally okay? What is the end of this type of lying? Where does it lead? It can't lead anywhere good and it infuriates me that he is allowed to just straight-up lie without consequences.

That being said, I feel as though it may be earlier to survive one than people make it out to be. When pictured, people usually think of a post apocalyptic world but I think we could go about life pretty normally.
For starters, if this disease eats away at the host like it portrays in some media’s, it’s going to eventually get rid of their ability to see, hear, touch and even bite meaning they’re not really all that dangerous. Even if it doesn’t, and it only starts to infect the dead the only real threat are really only people who have recently passed away as their body has not been corroded yet, and likely still have full functionality. But I feel like this doesn’t make things all that harder because everyone would steer clear of the zombie once it first becomes infected, hence creating less infected and making it easier to contain. Again, the zombie is slow so you have plenty of time to react.

Well I live in a town with an obscene homeless population, one of the largest in America. 

Anti homeless architecture does not reflect how hard a city is trying to help their homeless people. Some cities are super neglectful and others aren’t. But regardless, the architecture itself isn’t the problem. I know that my city puts tons of money into homeless shelters and rehabilitation, and that the people who sleep on the public benches are likely addicted to drugs or got kicked out for some other reason. I agree 100% that it’s the city’s responsibility to aid the homeless.

But getting angry at anti homeless architecture seems to imply that these public benches were made for homeless people to sleep on…up until recently, it was impossible to walk around downtown without passing a homeless person on almost every corner, and most of them smelled very strongly of feces. But we’ve begun to implement anti homeless architecture and the changes to our downtown have been unbelievable. We can actually sit on the public benches now, there’s so much less litter everywhere, and the entire downtown area is just so much more vibrant and welcoming.

1991b9g,CMV: The trouble young men are having with dating right now is exaggerated and mostly caused by stunted social development rather than anything young women are doing.,"It has become common in certain online circles to complain about how many young men are single. It does seem to be true that singleness among young men is particularly high right now, but the reasons for this are not what many dejected young men say they are.

Those in the so-called ""manosphere"" or the various ""pilled"" communities generally blame women for their singleness. They accuse women of ""hypergamy"", IE dating men of higher social status than themselves. They accuse women of having unrealistic standards and say most women will only date a man who is over 6 feet tall with an income above 100,000 dollars. Some end up just hating women in general. 

I do not think these people are correct. What I see is a generation of young men who, relative to previous generations, rarely go out of the house and rarely socialize with women in real life. So many young Gen Z men are socially and even physically under-developed because their primary sources of recreation and socialization have been virtual for their whole lives. When you talk to these young men in real life it is clear that they have not developed the social skills and hobbies necessary to interact normally and healthily with women they're attracted to. Moreover, the way these young men talk about women online makes it absolutely clear that they do not regularly interact with a variety of women in real life and do not have a realistic understanding of women.

To put it simply, most women are not interested in dating socially awkward and physically under-developed men who spend all day on the Internet. I think we can all understand that and accept it as normal.

How big is this problem really? Online, it's huge. In real life, I don't think it's all that serious. The great majority of these dejected young men eventually grow up, acquire real life jobs and hobbies, and learn to interact with women like human beings. Once they do that, they generally find women much more interested in them and live a perfectly normal life.",Grandemestizo,682,0.6800000071525574,1383,1705510461,2024-01-17 10:54:21,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1991b9g/cmv_the_trouble_young_men_are_having_with_dating/,1,2024
19a0ir3,"CMV: My teen spends much more time Online than IRL, and I believe it's an unhealthy balance that will impact his future relationships.","As a parent, I'm concerned about my 13yo son's social engagements, which is mostly online, through gaming. He has friends from school, but rarely sees them after school or on the weekends outside of school. I worry about the long-term effects on his social and emotional development as a person spending so much time online.

I'm in my late 40s, and grew up in a time before smartphones and online communities. In my experience in-person interactions benefited me greatly: getting a deeper understanding of friends through nonverbal cues, a sense of true connection with friends when you're just hanging out, and the opportunity for more meaningful conversations when there are fewer distractions around.

These things seem to be missing in my son's online interactions, which are often limited to in-game discussions about strategy, or even which game to play next, and then lack any in-depth (or even mundane talk) that happens naturally when you spend time together face-to-face. Also, he ends up meeting a variety of online-only friends and those relationships are more fleeting and never get that deep and real. I think spending more time with fewer, but real in person friends would be better for his social development. He'd have more opportunities to learn social skills - listening, empathy, resolving conflicts, social cues, etc.

I advocate for a much more balanced approach, ideally splitting his social time equally between online and offline. We already don't allow him to play games during the weekdays when school is on. And I'd do more to encourage and allow him and his friends to get together in person more.",blueandyshores,437,0.8799999952316284,231,1705611196,2024-01-18 14:53:16,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19a0ir3/cmv_my_teen_spends_much_more_time_online_than_irl/,1,2024
19a7yjm,CMV: voters can and should be blamed for the horrible policies they enact by voting for certain parties politicians and policies,"I know this post will be controversial but I've been thinking about it for some time. There seems to be a disconnect over how politicians and law and regulation is overall started in the United states. Many people will give a pass to a person who voted for a politican who enacts a bad policy for their state country or city. It all starts origin wise with a vote by the people for a person or proposition to enact a law. 

For example the people in states like Texas and Idaho and other states with complete abortion bans (even the life of the mother is really just on paper) if you are a conservative person who has been voting republican your whole life and saw the extremist pro forced birth laws creep in your state year after year you can't be surprised by your state now post dobbs going full abortion ban. Many will say it's counter productive to do this as it could drive people away from changing their beliefs and voting for another person party or policy. But I believe that confronting someone with that fact that these polices that are enacted are in fact started by a vote. Many people feel that their votes are not causes for bad policy and can divorce their responsibility for their vote for harmful policy. Many ""left wing"" Podcasters claimed this about blaming Trump voters in 2016 by saying you couldn't blame them for voting for him. 

And so people don't think I'm leaning politically one way or another I think that way about a voter in the south side of Chicago who bemoans gang violence but won't vote for another alderman or state representative or voters who are upset about rising crime yet vote for people who support cashless bail or abolishing bail altogether.",SnooPeripherals2455,272,0.7699999809265137,196,1705630687,2024-01-18 20:18:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19a7yjm/cmv_voters_can_and_should_be_blamed_for_the/,1,2024

19apxuf,CMV: plastic surgery is largely unnecessary and people need therapy more than plastic surgery,"Excluding outlier cases such as deformities or deformities caused by accidents, or anything pertaining to health. I think plastic surgery has a place of usefulness.

I am talking about the casual pursuit of more and more plastic surgery + fillers + Botox - particularly in young people who spend a lot of time on social media.

Social media has caused an unhealthy obsession with appearance. There are communities on Reddit where people exclusively pick each other apart, tell them what kind of plastic surgery they need, then encourage posters to come back and update with their new look.

This is kind of nuts. Changing your face to look more like everyone else in pursuit of a beauty ideal (and those ideals change) makes me think people need therapy to help them feel comfortable in their skin more than they need to change themselves to fit the ideal.

I don’t think it’s “acceptance” to accept that people get plastic surgery to fit some societal ideal. Acceptance would be just accepting people as they are and not placing such an insane value on being “attractive” (a shifting goalpost tbh).


Edit to clarify point: 

I think I need to clarify - I am not saying it should be illegal, that people who get cosmetic surgery should be judged, or that they shouldn’t be allowed to get surgery.

I’m saying my view is that a lot of the demand for cosmetic procedures is inherently unhealthy and driven by social media and looking at images of ourselves more than we were ever meant to.

I am not referring to necessary plastic surgery to correct issues, fix real deformities or problems that would affect how someone is treated (that includes cosmetic surgeries!!)

19brluv,CMV: Sex offenders with more then 10 victims should be chemically castrated and sterilized for the betterment of society,"As harsh as it sounds I really do think it’s necessary. Nobody stumbles into the life of being a serial rapist. It’s not like some sexual assault cases where there’s some, if not nuance, then grey area. To be clear, the assault happening is unjustifiable and wrong no matter what, but the college frat boy who rapes a girl while she’s passed out at a party is different from a predator following a woman to her job, her gym, her house, waiting for a moment to kidnap her and get his rocks off. More time, planning, obsession and in some cases violence go into the latter type of offender.

The frat boy, in most cases I’ve seen, is opportunistic. They want sex. They’d prefer it consensually but if the girl is drunk and too fucked up to say “no” they’re fine with that too. Serial rapists however, they get off on the lack of consent. They get off on the resistance. They want the person to scream, fight and try and run. Domination is inextricably bound up with their sexual desire. 

Did anybody watch The Last of Us on HBO? Well, there’s a character just like that in the show. Someone that gets off on resistance. Someone like that can’t be reformed, retrained or redeemed. They’re wild dogs. And even if you could “tame” them, it’s still too risky in my opinion. A drunk who relapses will likely hurt themselves, either via alcohol poisoning or just your run-of-the-mill self-destruction of their lives. A junkie will likely be the same. Though the risk they betray a friend or family member and rob them for a quick fix is also a factor. They too are more likely to just OD and die.

A serial sex offender though? If they relapse someone is getting raped.

That risk is too much for me. Humans are animals, no? If an untrained/abused/mentally ill dog bites two or three kids, not matter how much their owners might love them, they’re getting put down for the benefit of society according to the state. Even if you could put them on meds or put them in a different environment there’s always the risk that down the line something could set them off and then it might not be a bitten kid you’re dealing with but a dead one. I feel like this is a happy medium for the criminal justice reformers and the tough-on-crime crowd. Because when the offender is “fixed”, we release them from prison free of the “urges” that would make them want to attack someone again, we save billions of dollars that would be otherwise spent on feeding and housing them, and the “law and order” crowd can sleep soundly knowing these guys are castrated and, though they’re free, will remain on a list for the rest of their lives.

But it's not solely money -- dating apps will give only the extremely attractive men every option to date and find love. It will give attractive women too many options. But it will give less than near perfect standard people nowhere near as good an option for dating and marrying, because 90-95% of matches goes to an absurdly small % of people on these apps. In this case, it didn't democratize anything because human choice and preference maintains the same, making the apps pointless. 

Looking to social media, our likely online third spaces, we see the same. Many of us post videos and photos, but only a small % of people get the opportunity for a bigger community.

19dyanb,"CMV: The ""Free Market"" doesn't work with goods and services that are necessary to sustain life. An choice of purchase or die is not a free and voluntary exchange entered into by equals, its an ultimatum.","I think the free market, such as it is anyway, works pretty well for about 90% of the normal consumer good related market activity most of us engage in.

The ""free market"" breaks down, it's internal check and balance mechanisms, become self destructive, when the good or service is one that cannot be refused on pain of death or substantial material deprivation. 

This is why healthcare, housing, and food are so often the ones that require the greatest government intervention to stabilize and are most prove to radical exploitation is left to their own devices. Everyone needs to live somewhere, and everyone is eventually gonna need a doctor, everyone has to eat, and one cannot freely opt to refuse these services, well you can, but in the same way you can freely choose to not give a mugger your wallet and get shot. It's not a ""free"" choice, it's a coercion and an ultimatum. It is widely accepted that a choice made at spearpoint isn't a free choice. Whether that spear it literal or in the form of not being able to afford insulin.

Without the consumer being a free agent, able to enter into an exchange with the purveyor as equals, able to arrive at a mutual beneficial transaction, the inherent self-correcting mechanisms of the ""free"" market break down, because at that point the market, at least the market for that good or service, is not free. It is obligatory. 

When a good cannot be refused, on pain of death or severe material deprivation, the purveyor is free to jack up the price as high as they wish, they are free to price a large swathe of people out of the market entirely, accepting their demise as chaff if it means the profit they pull in off of the substantially higher price on fewer transactions still proves more fruitful than lower profit on more transactions.   


There are only two ways to address this. At a certain point, people, as in the bulk of the people, the mass of the people, will not merely accept dying cause their job doesn't pay enough. That state of affairs will eventually lead to civil unrest of uprising. Which of course will see a breakdown of the market. To avoid this happening, an institution, usually the government, must put their hand into the transaction in some way to ensure the populace has access to the service, either by subsidizing the purchasers or placing price controls on the purveyors. 

&#x200B;

But long story short, in the case of an obligatory good or service, the market can never be free. The choice is coercive to the buyer by default, and can only be corrected by institutional intervention, or dismantling the market entirely (usually violent revolt).

* ""The Algerian government is corrupt, sexism, homophobic and authoritarian, but it´s not their fault: they have generational trauma from colonisation"", said by a human rights lawyer

These are not isolated opinions. These are not a few random crazies on the internet. This is what the discourse is now in spaces visited and influencing dozens (hundreds?) of millions. This is not an anomaly you can ignore and wait until it goes away. And it is getting worse.

This way of talking about trauma and oppression has only been really popular for 3-4 years, and already it has gone so far. 

Add onto it the increasing spread of self-diagnosis, and the idea that these feelings HAVE to be affirmed as the default, and you are creating an epidemic of horrible people being excused of their behavior, and even being treated as the victim.

19fctws,"CMV: ""Victim syndrome"" has pervaded almost every group around the world over the last 30 years","The idea of the echo chamber isn't new. Nations and political groups have always used it to coerce people into action. 

However, the last 30 years of increasingly ""personalized"" news and social media has created more and more self-contained echo chambers that deeply benefit from hyping their specific audience's particular fears and concerns. They rely on the age old technique of blaming reliable ""boogeymen"" that are out to get them.

As the increasing economic distortion field of social media makes us feel more and more insecure about our own social and economic standing, these echo chambers tell us that we, too, would be rich and powerful if some other group hadn't wronged us or wasn't trying to destroy us. 

In many (if not all) cases, there is some real injustice and, possibly, genuine concerns that ought to be addressed. However, the echo chamber serves to amplify the scope and scale of those concerns and discount or dismiss the concerns of others. 

The facilitators of the echo chamber profit from their enablement leading people to go deeper and deeper into the victimhood rabbit hole. 

People occasionally peek out of the rabbit hole and see that their victimhood is not validated by others or see other people's sense of victimhood as a threat to their own desire to be the ""true victims"" who deserve attention and restitution. 

Any denial of their ""true victim"" identity only serves as proof of the threat from the ""other.""

There is no truth unless it agrees with us. Facts are replaced with varying sets of ""alternative facts."" We are told not to trust our eyes or our feelings if they counter our narrative. They claim that the conspirators of our destruction are rooted deep in every institution and they are continually working towards our demise. 

There is no nuance. There can be no compromise. Every person who disagrees with us is ""in the pocket"" or ""under the control"" of ""the other."" Every fight is another step in the existential struggle. Every slight is proof of the other's intention to destroy. Every victory is a sign of righteousness. All damage done in the name of the cause is excusable. 

So... deeper and deeper we go until the only option left is the complete suppression and silencing of others who do not acknowledge our absolute and unarguable right to be validated and for our perceived wrongs to be made right. 

This, to me, seems like the template for each group I interact with and I see no sign that this will change given how the echo chambers are being reinforced by the increasingly ""personalized,"" click-driven media landscape.",ExtinctLikeNdiaye,270,0.7400000095367432,112,1706198995,2024-01-25 10:09:55,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19fctws/cmv_victim_syndrome_has_pervaded_almost_every/,1,2024

What I am seeing though is that since Biden is running for his second term, the Democratic party is not going to have a primary election inside the party to see who should go running against the Republican candidate. 

Just because it's expected / agreed that the sitting President will do it? Why? If the first term of the President was really great then he would get the nomination anyway - but shouldn't it be an honest election?

Personally (and also I think indicated by the the latest data) it just seems like a recipe for a loss. Since there are people who just just really might dislike the current President. 

Is it not as obvious as it seems or what am I missing?

19fhzm8,CMV: No drug should “be tried by everyone at least once”,"I’ve heard it plenty of times by users, mostly referring to psychedelics but marijuana as well. I’ve tried these substances and experienced how potent they can be and alter your perceptions and outlooks for the better, but to say EVERYONE should give them a try is simply absurd.

Abusing psychedelics can lead to psychosis, HPPD, schizophrenia, worst case scenario a psychotic episode leading to death of the user or those around them. There’s a news article I saw getting popular recently about a woman having a psychotic episode off of marijuana and stabbing her boyfriend over a hundred times. 

Of course cases like these are relatively few and far between. Responsible users would take all of the necessary precautions to ensure the risk of an event like this happening is as minimal as possible, but not everyone is a responsible user. Even if you include controls like being of a mature age, having no history of mental illness in yourself or family, being in a safe environment at the time of effects, etc., the risk of mishaps is higher than 0% and must be considered.

I believe psychedelics and marijuana have the potential to give wonderful experiences and alleviate some of the stress that life carries, but these are powerful substances that must be respected, and the potential risks of everyone trying them just once outweighs the rewards.

My buddy and I will die on this hill. My argument is that if you went to a restaurant and ordered boneless wings and chicken nuggets, you would always get two distinctly different dishes. If you went to a restaurant and ordered boneless wings and you received a plate of chicken nuggets covered in sauce you would think to yourself, “hey these are chicken nuggets, not boneless wings.” And you would not be happy that that’s what they served you. 

Chicken nuggets have always been ultra processed shaped “nuggets” and boneless wings will never be processed to the degree that nuggets are. Another part of the argument brings in chicken tenders. If you call boneless wings nuggets, you have to call chicken tenders nuggets too. Granted, boneless wings are not deboned wings. That’s just the name that restaurants have adopted to please people and give people a “boneless wings option.” Change my view.",GardenOrca,256,0.7900000214576721,119,1706371671,2024-01-27 10:07:51,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ace5gs/cmv_boneless_wings_and_chicken_nuggets_are_two/,1,2024
1acfvhn,CMV: Men are becoming more conservative because progressives refuse to talk about men's issues.,"The way I see it. There's few people who want to speak to men about the issues the face in a way that doesn't either center women or blame men. I took multiple feminist studies classes in college and something I noticed as the only man there was that how patriarchial standards harm men was also said as a footnote, minimized, or implied that men were holding the boot on their own heads. 

As a man born in 2001 who has literally no political or socioeconomic power other than my own ability to vote, I could easily see how this would be frustrating. I feel there are issues I have to deal with that women do not have to. I also feel that it's not other men that cause 100% of those issues 100% of the time. A lot of women who believe they are feminists don't want to acknowledge this because they feel conceding any point to women having any aspect of life easier than or playing into certain patriarchial roles anti-feminist and pro-men.

Men are struggling to date more and more. I mean I saw some statistics that men age 18 to 30 were twice as likely to be single than the same age group. Many young men are struggling to find romantic partnerships. The ""feminist"" view to that is to tell them that they're not entitled to romantic love. The Petersonian view is that men are struggling and they should be allowed to feel what they feel and it is a problem that so many men are lonely. g that hates you.

With this I think there's been a bit of an overcorrection to casual misogyny that women specifically in my generation do where they call for an end to casual misogyny (valid and correct) while combating it with casual misandry. Again, seeing both of these views perpetuated by what you believe feminist are and by someone who calls themself a feminist, you're not gonna want to look into it. You'll view it as something counter to you and something that hates you.

This is such a common belief that the average man's exposure to ""feminism"" is likely going to be from social media and turn him off from feminist ideals. I mean why would he? If some 19-year-old dude keeps seeing online that not only is he oppressing women but he's also the cause of his issues, he's not gonna see feminism as a positive thing. st, you're not gonna want to look into it.

In reality, teachers only say that because of how easy Wikipedia makes assignments. And any smart person *still* used Wikipedia for assignments.

You simply scrolled to the bottom and clicked on the sources that were linked, then cited those in your work, even if you just got the info from Wikipedia.

As a website developer myself, who even once put up a fake news website to humor my friends, anyone can make a website. So nothing is really reputable if it’s not peer reviewed.

Teachers accepted non-peer reviewed articles, and articles listed as sources on Wikipedia, but not a Wikipedia link itself. Simply because they knew it was too easy.

The admissions process works by taking an unbiased entrance test, after which candidates are ranked, based on how they did on that test. 

I'm cases where the admissions process works by interviewing candidates, I could potentially see the use for quotas (because when men are in positions of power, they might be more likely to accept men), but in cases where the admissions process is entirely skill-based, it does not make sense to me.

1adsjhe,CMV: Black-and-white Us-vs-Them thinking prevents us from resolving most social issues yet is impossible to avoid,"*I am starting this one with a genuine hope that someone can change my view. Please, change my view, I really hate having it.*

This problem comes up everywhere, but I'll explain on the example of gender debate as it's what I'm most embedded in. I realise it's massive in politics but it's not what I'm focusing on here.

The one thing I battle with the most is the tendency to paint all men or all women as being this or that, and using it to justify dismissing them and their problems, saying they're not deserving of something, justifying being mean to them, discriminating against them while claiming they asked for it, punishing an individual for the sins of the group, and so on.

Very often B&W thinking is underlined by some painful personal experience with one person or more, which is then generalised to the entire gender. Sometimes it's super overt, like [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0g2drvCUYj/) (men think of their families, women only about themselves) or [here](https://medium.com/@donna.gratehouse/society-does-include-men-but-whenever-society-is-being-called-upon-to-address-mens-problems-it-s-6ea30fe2f4ac) (women want to help men but all they ever get in return is violence). Other times it's by implication, like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiDpvn77eqE&lc=UgyZ5Bm0GnM23wIQ5wR4AaABAg) (highlighted comment implying that all women want marriage and will make it a disaster for men) or [here](https://medium.com/@lelper/10-things-for-guys-not-to-do-on-dating-apps-5680ce34ffd9) (men are shit at dating, listing 10 sins which are hardly things only men do). I'm literally just picking a couple examples I've got fresh in my mind, but there are millions around. 

It's usually examples of the [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error). 

* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the good ones and everything **we** do is good or, if it's bad, it's because **They** provoked us or deserved it anyway. Meanwhile, when **They** do something bad, it's proof of their wicked evil nature.
* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the innocent victims and underdogs and **They** are the perpetrators in power.

Those basic narratives are so powerful and play so hard to the tribal thinking we evolved with, that it's incredibly hard to break out of them. The simplicity of this heuristic just makes it win with the complex truth that the world is not B&W but all shades and colours, that everybody is different and you can't just treat groups as monoliths. They might have power in this domain but we have power in another, many people in the group might have power but not necessarily this person, some of us are also pretty shitty sometimes while some of them are actually great, and so on.

Of course, there are many who know this. When you explicitly ask people about it, many will say this. But in practice, most still act and overwhelmingly think in terms of black-and-white. And it's a constant in human history - it's as much of a problem now as it was in Ancient Greece, we have evolved nothing.

What does this mean? It means that it is just such a bloody pain to get through to people! To help them stop spending so much energy on fighting each other and instead use it on making the world better for everyone. We keep fighting culture wars with imagined enemies and make everyone's lives miserable, while all it would take is to just stop and admit that there is in fact no us and them. That we're just all people who make mistakes and can get better.

But so I go, trying to promote this view, yet every time I feel like I succeeded on some small scale, I just see more and more of that everywhere else. It seems so inescapable. Can you please change my view and show me that it's not?",Simon_Fokt,436,0.8799999952316284,414,1706525378,2024-01-29 04:49:38,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1adsjhe/cmv_blackandwhite_usvsthem_thinking_prevents_us/,1,2024

1ae4b6a,"CMV: No group of people in history would willing allow the enactment of anything like the Zionist project on their own land, and no group of people would, in the Palestinians' place, respond to Zionism with anything but hostility.","For me, the most frustrating thing about the discourse surrounding Palestine-Israel is the way in which the Palestinian people are routinely portrayed as irrationally extreme, violent, or anti-Semitic, when in fact their deep hostility to Zionism (and Israel in general) is the most obvious and predictable thing imaginable. I am convinced that **no group of people in history would willing allow the enactment of anything like the Zionist project on their own land, and no group of people would, in the Palestinians' place, respond to Zionism with anything but hostility.**

Imagine the following scenario in *your* country:

* A group of people are immigrating into your country in massive numbers, and *they have made it explicitly clear they want their own state on your land*. They go from a trivial percent of the population (\~2%) to almost a third of the population in around a generation. A foreign power retains control of your immigration policy and doesn't allow you to stop the influx
* As soon as this group arrives, they begin lobbying foreign powers to grant them their own state on your land. They'd love all of it, but they'll take as much as they can get for now
* They buy up land from absentee owners and kick off native tenants. They enact terms on the land that makes it illegal for it ever to be owned or worked by anyone but them ever again
* Eventually they succeed in making their case to the reigning superpowers: despite representing less than one third of the population and being mostly foreign-born, they are granted over half of your land — including half the coast and virtually all of the best farmland. Additionally huge numbers of your people will now have to live in their ethnostate, while none of them are expected to live on your side.

Given this history, the Palestinians rejected the 48' deal. Can someone seriously tell me that they are surprised? How do you imagine *your* people would respond? Do you really think that your people would have accepted that deal? 

Or, to put it differently, if the Zionists had wanted Connecticut or Cornwall for their state, do you think the US or UK would have considered that proposition for a single second? Do you think they would have handed over a single acre of their territory for a Jewish state? And if not, why should the Palestinians have been expected to?

Here is some additional evidence:

* The 30s and 40s were a massive litmus test of the Western world's decency toward refugees, and virtually everyone failed. There *were* hundreds of thousands of Jews looking for a home then, due to Nazism, and every single country turned them away. As an American, I think it is to our eternal shame that we did not go out of way to take in the whole of European Jewry, but if the US — a far larger and richer country with a much, much larger Jewish population (at the time) — was unwilling to open its doors, why are we surprised that the Palestinians weren't crazy about Jewish immigration, when it clearly meant the death of their society?
* I was once arguing with a Zionist about the right of return. And he said: ""Of course we can't offer them a right of return. It would mean the end of the Jewish nature of Israel."" He was right of course — that would be the result. He was also right to imply that *obviously* Israel is going to implement policies that protect it from being overwhelmed demographically; obviously, Israel is going to behave with the instinct towards self-defense that all functioning societies do. But to him the Palestinians were simply not human enough for him to have to consider the obvious: the entire existence of Israel is predicated on the Palestinians having been denied the right to do this very thing, to protect their society's integrity
* Far smaller rates of immigration create tremendous controversy throughout the developed world. Think about how controversial Muslim immigration into Europe is. Right now Muslims represent around 7.5% of France's population, after 80 years of immigration. In Palestine, in less time, Jews went from 2% to 30% of the population. And it's funny: most of the folks that are pro-Israel are also anti-immigration. They would absolutely lose their minds if they were made to tolerate the rates of immigration the Palestinians had to, especially if their immigrants were making it known they wanted their own country!
* In fact, I cannot think of a single country that currently allows the rates of immigration seen in Palestine in the early 20th century.
* I cannot think of a single people in history that has willingly allowed such a massive demographic change to take place on its land. If you can think of one, please, by all means, share.
* I cannot think of a single people who have willingly traded away any of their land for the sake of others' national aspirations
* I expect to hear the common Zionist talking point that ""There never was a Palestinian state, and Palestinian identity only goes back to the early 20th century."" This is undoubtedly true, but, for the life of me, I cannot understand what the implication of this is supposed to be. Are they saying: ""because the Arabs of the land of Palestine never had a nation state, it's okay to swap out their society for another one""? This logic looks remarkably like that used to colonize the Americas and Africa: they don't have a state, so they don't count politically. If this means something else, please let me know.

My experience proves that this is absolutely untrue. The average Brit knows very little about continental Europe, let alone the world. I was shocked when cca 80% of people I interacted with confused my home country of Serbia with Siberia (not a country, not in Europe) or with Syria (not Europe). Yes, it’s a small country, but it’s the same continent! They have expressed similarly ignorant attitudes towards other countries in ‘eastern’ Europe - confusing Lithuania and Slovenia (?!), thinking Prague was a country, saying how ‘it’s all Russia’, ‘the funny moustache guy was Russsian’ etc. 
And bearing in mind, some of these were said by students at top Universities.

In fact, their attitude is quite embarrassing since they do not know about their own continent. Not to mention the rest of the world (a man convincing the other that the Taj Mahal is in Abu Dhabi, which also happens to be the capital of India apparently). In fact, the only thing Brits might know more about is the US, since they seem to align themselves more closely to them.

They might know something little about western Europe, like France bc of proximity or Spain bc of holidays, but that’s about it.

1aeuoo0,"CMV: A major reason the Trades are dying is not because younger people are lazy, but because the work culture is awful and no one is willing to train apprentices.","When between jobs previously, I had occasionally considered working in the trades. I enjoy working with my hands, and I think some trades such as electrical work sound very interesting on top of that. However, one thing always stopped me. When I was younger, I used to work security on a few construction sites and noticed something that put me off the trades permanently.

The work culture was just beyond awful. Plenty of verbal abuse (screaming curses, insults, and slurs) from bosses towards the apprentices, plenty of racist, sexist, and homophobic talk, and plenty of generally nasty behavior across the board. It didn't matter which site I was at, or which company was working there, there was a similar trend.  This was only half the issue though - the other half I noticed is that for all these construction companies and tradespeople complain about their dying industry, none of them are even willing to train anyone as an apprentice unless they're a family friend or paying for it through school which presents the same issue of accessibility as university. Half the people at those sites were perfectly competent men who were working for total peanuts as temp laborers in the desperate hope that they'd get chosen as an apprentice.

And, you know, who honestly wants to do any of that?

You can call me weak or a snowflake, and that's fine, but the fact of the matter is that younger generations overwhelmingly don't want to deal with that kind of work culture.

1afie1j,"CMV: The Palestinians' fear of getting ethnically cleansed is very real and valid, and it needs to be taken seriously.","It was reported yesterday that 11 cabinet ministers and 15 coalition members of the Knesset attended a conference calling for a ""voluntary migration"" plan of Gazans. Let's call a spade a spade, this is textbook ethnic cleansing. It's no different from when the US ""asked"" Native Americans to move to reservations, or when Soviets conducted population transfers in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. There's no ""voluntary"" here when their homes have been destroyed by the IDF.

The people attended this conference were not some fringe figures as well, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich were both there, they are the Minster of National Security and Minister of Finance respectively. They are also in the war cabinet. Despite the fact that the government has denied these plans, it remains true that these people have real power and real influence in the government. 

When it comes to public perception, the plan is not deeply unpopular or fringe as well. 33% of Israelis support the resettlement and annexation of Gaza and 56% oppose it. Governments all around the world have implemented policies much less popular than 33%, just ask Netanyahu's protestors last year. A proposed policy that only a slim majority of Israelis oppose has a very good chance of becoming actual policy if the political climate changes, even slightly.

If you're a Palestinian, I think it's valid to have fears of being ethnically cleansed from your homes when the climate in Israeli politics is so in favour of such a policy. We need to recognise that and take concrete steps to reaffirm that that's not going to happen, by drawing red lines, or punishing problematic officials, etc.",WheatBerryPie,1063,0.6499999761581421,1608,1706709332,2024-01-31 07:55:32,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afie1j/cmv_the_palestinians_fear_of_getting_ethnically/,1,2024
1afqnkw,CMV: There is no legitimate reason D.C. shouldn't be a state or at least absorbed into a neighboring state,"For those who are not American's, the capital of the USA is Washington D.C. which is not itself a state nor is it part of any state. It is a federal district which offers those citizens living within it little benefits and many disadvantages. I care not for the historical reasons it was not originally created as a state, I only care the facts as they stand today.

* D.C. is just over 60 sq miles which is quite a bit smaller that the smallest state, Rhode Island at over 1,200 sq miles.
* It has a population of 690,000 which is larger than two states.
* The nearly 700k people living in D.C. have no federal representation in congress besides a non-voting member (who aggressively advocates for statehood).
* Despite not having representation, they still need pay federal taxes like any other citizen.
* Over 80% of D.C. citizens want to become a state.

As far as I can tell, the arguments for D.C. statehood are sound and comprehensive. The only argument against D.C. statehood I know of is that it's citizens lean heavily democrat and the republicans don't want more democrats in congress (which I do not find compelling).

1afvqlm,CMV: America is both overhated and underrated,"When America helps people or helps the world, nobody really shows any gratitude. And if we help in *too* much or in the wrong ways we get called cultural imperialists sticking our white noses into brown/black people's business and messing up their countries. If we don’t help enough, as the case shows in Rwanda or the current Latin American refugee crisis, we’re a callous, settler-colonial nation who couldn’t give two shits about the plight of the black man or the brown man suffering just beyond our borders.

The history of human life on earth is in large part a study of the various empires we created over thousands of years and based on our predecessors, I’d say if America is an empire, we’re by far the most benign and just the world has yet seen. We’re grading on a curve of course but does anybody else here reasonably think we’d be better under a Pax Russia? Pax China? Pax Britannia? How about the slave empires of the antiquity such as Rome, Greece, or any of the Islamic Caliphates? 

There should be some middle ground between giving the appropriate credit to countries that have made enormous strides in terms of lifting their citizens out of poverty, ending hunger and raising the standards of living while also acknowledging the role, where it’s appropriate, of the US in facilitating it. For example, China lifting hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty is a major humans rights achievement. China is/should be very proud of it. But it never would have happened with out the aid of US markets, US credit, and US help. And we should take pride in that as well. But liberals think they’re above the low hanging fruit of patriotism, “why do we even need to be proud of our country? That’s weird.” — because it’s so associated with the political Right. 

So they go the opposite direction and constantly harp on all the wrongs America may or may not have done.

1agdy9r,CMV: Humans are inherently cooperative and egalitarian versus the violent and selfish brutes that modern civilization has made us out to be.,"Buckle up - this is going to be a long one.

I know this might seem counterintuitive to what is being observed in modern day societies. We have murder, rape, wars, genocide, slavery, hate crimes, and large disparities between classes of people. There’s so many examples of people hoarding resources from needy underserved populations. There’s many examples of corporate greed in which they know they’re poisoning the world (see: forever chemicals such as PFO/PFAs pushed by companies like DuPont and 3M that’s now in everyone - and I do mean everyone’s - blood streams) but fail to act because it would hurt their shareholders bottom line. 

Personally, I am a professional ecologist who works in the private sector in America and knows first hand how governments write and re-write laws to help bolster business profits at the expense of the environment. I am not naive to the throes of how every major system (social/racial/environmental) is basically fucked and in need of a major upheaval to get things back on track - if they were ever on track in the first place.

All of this can be chalked up to greed of the few at the expense of the many. This greed seems to trickle down to the everyday person because if you’re not looking out for number one you’ll get left behind in the poisonous dust, polluted air, and contaminated drinking water. You’ll be poor, uneducated, and forever stuck in the cycle of being exploited for what little you do have by those who want it all.

However, I am currently in the process of writing a book about how f*cked humans are, how we got here, and what we can do about it. Through my interdisciplinary research I have discovered surprising theories contrary to what is obviously happening to us all. Which has changed my pessimistic POV of what being human really means.

Richard Dawkins might be the proponent of the trickle up theory of how our genes are selfish which equates to us as humans being selfish but I have come to the conclusion that he is ultimately short sighted in his argument.

To begin let’s get some dates straight - humans (Homo sapien sapien) first appeared 200,000 years ago. The beginning of modern civilization was only birthed 10,000 years ago with advent of agriculture (the Neolithic Revolution) which changed the way humans lived from migratory hunter-gathering to a more sedentary lifestyle. The sedentary life style that agriculture required is what has done us in, not our biology.

We are taught that our selfish brutish behaviors are inherent to our biology because if we just look to our closest ancestors - the chimpanzee - we will see that they too are violent creatures that live in cyclical harmony but are fraught with war, infanticide, resource hoarding, and rape. We share 98% of our DNA with them, so this must be true. But what is frequently over looked is that the chimpanzee is not our only closest relative there are also the bonobos. 

Bonobos also share 98% of our DNA and they are free of war, rape, infanticide, and resource hoarding. They’re cooperative, have sex for pleasure and conflict resolution, and are matriarchal. Historically, pre-agriculture, we share more with bonobos than we ever did with chimpanzees. In our natural environment which we evolved for, not the current one we are living in, we share more with bonobos than we ever did with chimpanzees.

Anthropological and archaeological investigations into hunter and gatherer tribes of the modern day show that the predominant themes between them are that they are egalitarian, cooperative, friendly, and easy going. This can be extrapolated to pre-modern humans due to the fact that these tribes, as seen in aboriginals or the Inuits to name two, have lived a traditional lifestyle up until very recently. 

Hunter-gathering tribes consisted of up to approximately 150 individuals. Which means that everyone knows everyone which then equates to social accountability. These tribes, while there are always exceptions to the norm, shared resources and didn’t praise anyone above anyone else as everyone was doing their part in supporting the tribe. Those who might have been too aggressive, attempted to resource hoard, or were disruptive in any way were ostracized, isolated, or even killed when other means didn’t work so that social cohesion was maintained.

Agriculture, on the other hand, ballooned populations due to increase fertility of women (not really a good thing) to levels where no one could know everyone which led to decrease accountability. Agriculture invented property, first with land and water, and then people were seen as resources by those who needed more workers to plow their fields. Agriculture birthed the patriarchy and made women and children into property. Agriculture created classes of the have and have nots and that led to disparity. Agriculture invented slavery as “civilized” societies captured and drug in hunter and gathering societies by their feet into their communities for cheap labor. Agriculture caused those in power to hoard resources from the greater collective. Agriculture led to wars between societies looking for more resources. Agriculture is the root of zoonotic (influenza, SARs, chickenpox etc) diseases to spread through our species. Agriculture led to famines as climate patterns changed. Agriculture led to the balloon of mental health problems. Agriculture is what destroyed our egalitarian ways.

We lived for approximately 190,000 years as hunter gathers amongst our family and kin. We lived in an environment which we were evolved for and we as a species were better for it. As Darwin points out, altruism and cooperation was naturally selected for because it was better for the species and as social animals because protecting our communities was as important as important as protecting oneself.

So, no we aren’t inherently selfish like Dawkins tries to claim nor are we naturally violent as our chimpanzee cousins. These are both symptoms of a sickness caused by living in an unnatural system. Just as birds who are kept confined that pluck out all their feathers, we are losing our minds and what it means to be truly human because of modern society - something we are not evolved for.

TL;DR humans are not naturally violent and selfish as modern day evidence has led us to believe. We lived as egalitarian altruistic communities for 190,000 years before the invention of agriculture. Agriculture and the sedentary life style that it required is what has caused us to become who we are today and is not a true reflection of the human species.",notmepleaseokay,348,0.7699999809265137,247,1706802279,2024-02-01 09:44:39,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1agdy9r/cmv_humans_are_inherently_cooperative_and/,2,2024
1ager2s,CMV: hunting meat is more ethical than buying it from a grocery store,"Inspired by someone talking about how hunters creep them out because ""why do you want to kill an animal/ watch it die when you can just buy it from the store?"" and they were implying that its like something psychopaths do. I don't hunt but honestly I think its way less ethical to buy from a store than to hunt for yourself. The meat industry has a huge impact on global warming, it takes up massive amounts of land, and most animals live and die in horribly cruel circumstances. I am not innocent of buying meat from the grocery store, but I only eat meat about once every two weeks and try to treat it like a luxury instead of an every day food.  

I mean, even from an animal rights standpoint, what is better? an animal living its life in nature, with plenty of land to roam, or stuck in a tiny poo covered pen and only fed corn? It reminds me of that Parks and Rec episode where Ron brings a pig to slaughter for a family BBQ. There was gonna be a dead pig either way, slaughtering it in front of you only reminds you that at one point it was a live animal. 

I don't think trophy hunting is really justifiable. But hunting for food is a lot more ethical than buying it at a grocery store.

1ah5ccs,"CMV: For under $50, the single best piece of home gym equipment you can buy is a kettlebell.","This isn’t a big, intense, charged societal CMV. I’m genuinely looking for other thoughts here. But I do think the humble and versatile Kettlebell will be hard to beat.

The Kettlebell and the myriad associated exercises can do cardio or strength. It can be dynamic with swings and snatches, or low impact and static.

It has no moving parts and is incredibly sturdy (I’m talking the proper iron ones, I know the cheaper sand/plastic imitations aren’t as reliable). It takes up a very small footprint.

The big downside would be that you choose a specific weight and live with it for a while. I could see a user hitting a plateau after a time.  But even there I think the kettlebell is dynamic enough where you can feel a certain amount of mastery and fluidity, which will give your workouts greater depth.

**Defining ‘Single Piece of Home Gym Equipment’:** We’re talking about something that is reasonably one ‘thing’ used in a workout.  

So a ‘set of dumbbells’ is pushing the concept, but I’d listen. Because you do sort of need two dumbbells to do alternating curls or other sorts of established dumbbell workouts.

An attachment for an existing workout station or squat rack you may have doesn’t work. But a standalone doorway pull up bar type attachment would.

1ahyd7d,CMV: The sentence of Bryn Spejcher for stabbing her boyfriend to death was ridiculous.,"I'm refering to the California woman who stabbed her boyfriend 108 times after consuming cannabis and only sentenced last month to 100 days of community service.

This case reminds me of Sarah Halimi's one in France where an elderly lady got thrown off a window by a man who had just taken cannabis before his rampage and was considered not criminally responsible penally.

Although, contrarily to that other murder I do think that Bryn was indeed in a serious state of psychosis as she not only stabbed her boyfriend but her dog, and herself. And when the police intervened, even taser and baton strikes were not very effective at stopping her.

That being said I do believe that the sentence she received was highly problematic (way too low) for these 4 reasons:

* Even if marijuana frenzies can potentially happen on rare occasions, I just don't believe a mentally stable person could reach such violence with only marijuana. This led me to believe that she either consumed other additional substances or that she has some sort of mental instability that can lead her to become violent in some instances. And if that second hypothesis is true, then she needs psychiatric treatment (which was the decision for Sarah Halimi's murderer)
* Maybe the most important of my 4 points: Her not being aware during the killing doesn't mean she isn't responsible for it. The fact that she willingly decided to take psychotropic drugs that could potentially cloud her judgment meant she was responsible for putting herself in that state. Correct me if I'm wrong but if a person after consuming alcohol becomes violent a attacks others, he will be convicted. Removing all responsibility for marijuana sounds like encouragement for murderers to use this excuse and be cleared of charges.
* Receiving only 100 days of community service after brutally killing someone is shameful and a total disrespect for the deceased and his family. It just isn't right.
* Let's not fool ourselves, she only got this miraculous judgment because she was an upper-class white woman. If it was a man, poor or of color that sentencing would have been different.

And for these 4 reasons are believe that Bryn judgment was not only unfair but dangerous.",vuzz33,544,0.8299999833106995,621,1706973492,2024-02-03 09:18:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ahyd7d/cmv_the_sentence_of_bryn_spejcher_for_stabbing/,2,2024
1aj04n2,"CMV: The USA's foreign policy is not to promote democracy, but to secure its own economic interest","A common thing that I keep hearing Americans say is that ""The USA is the great promoter of democracy"" or something along those lines. It usually assumes that democracy is more moral than authoritarianism (which I agree with to a certain extant), therefore the USA's foreign policy is broadly moral.

But that's just not true.

America allies with undemocratic states all the time, most notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia today, but also in the past. South Korea and Taiwan were dictatorships until 1987. Pakistan has shifted between democracy and military rule numerous times. The USA has often directly propped up dictators in other places as well like South Vietnam and Indonesia to secure their economic interests. Sometimes they even toppled governments that were elected democratically or were in favour of democracy, like in Iran and countless times in Latin America.

This pattern in foreign policy cannot be explained by the USA's willingness to protect democracy, but its willingness to secure its own economic interest. Egypt controls the Suez Canal and Saudi Arabia controls the oil. The USA must work with these authoritarian countries to ensure control over its own economic interests.

Therefore, the birthrate per woman in an urbanized liberal society will always be below replacement. Case in point: not a single Nordic country has managed to get to replacement level fertility despite their heavily subsidized childcare as well as other welfare programs.

The ugly truth is that replacement level fertility in urbanized populations can only be the result of society-wide cultural and/or economic coercion, so, for example, European countries' only choices are replacement migration and regression to a pro-family culture that would by definition stigmatize childlessness.",KitezhGrad,269,0.6800000071525574,830,1707249228,2024-02-06 13:53:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1akitl9/cmv_replacement_level_fertility_is_impossible_in/,2,2024

1aktlq9,CMV: talking about politics early in a relationship (even on the first date) is healthy and shouldn't be frowned upon especially in the United states,"I was inspired to post this here after reading an article in late 2022 early 2023 after the Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion (the Dobbs decision) that overturned roe v wade. 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/29/relationships-post-roe/&ved=2ahUKEwif6JzHkZiEAxXsm4kEHQ-1AmQ4ChDF9AEoAHoECAsQAg&usg=AOvVaw1d0y_ODgBmhuXN63xJR_KK

It says that more and more couples are reevaluating their long term relationships with their partners or spouses over the controversial dobbs decision in June of 2022. Many hadn't had that conversation with their partners or considered their partners postions at all. In the article it states how many are asking new partners or dates how they feel about it early on to see if they would be on the same page or if they should end the relationship before it gets more serious.

Now that got me thinking. I believe that it's extremely healthy for dates and new couples to talk extensively about politics in the beginning of relationships. When you think of it politics controls alot of out lives whether its a supreme court decision like dobbs or roe or a local issue like the town council expanding a local park both those issues involve politics. So how does not talking about politics early in a relationship not benefit people really by seeing if a potential spouse and you have the same values in life. Even ben Shapiro agrees with this 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dr1cK1WoL2HE&ved=2ahUKEwi59cuplpiEAxU_jYkEHc4ZBzIQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2QWbRsuE0M6ksLhrHZza3O

Now many will say politics doesn't equal values and that you shouldn't limit yourself or not want to date people bases on their political opinions. A famous couple who are in a relationship like that are democratic strategist James Carville and his wife republican strategist Mary matalin make it work (despite her joining the libertarian party with the rise of trump). I argue relationships like that came to be in an Era when Americans weren't ""political"" in a sense but since 2016 America has become a very political nation like European counties. Which can be shown with this study from the United Kingdom 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dating-relationships-tory-politics-b2095705.html&ved=2ahUKEwjNkr78pZiEAxXsjIkEHXkgDkcQFnoECBQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0Q6gE6zFYeFPiTgHYYsdoN

So I think debating and learning someone's politics early in a relationship is a healthy thing to do. Why would I want to invest time and energy in a relationship with someone whom I don't share my values (this is especially true if your non religious) why would I want to buy a house with someone who doesn't think climate change is real and wants to buy a beach house because nothing will happen. Why would I want to date someone who treats a homeless person with disdain if I value empathy and especially with bodily autonomy why would a woman want to date a man who doesn't value her bodily autonomy and why should I who might value euthanasia and ""pulling the plug"" want to date someone who doesn't belive in that either. Americans have (albeit an increasingly less) interest or stomach for giving their political opinions in public especially in the dating world and I think that in order to not waste either parties time that should and need to change.",SnooPeripherals2455,511,0.8199999928474426,510,1707277436,2024-02-06 21:43:56,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aktlq9/cmv_talking_about_politics_early_in_a/,2,2024

We’ve tried. Look at the NYC public school system. We’ve shoveled dump trucks worth of money into their pockets and, while seeing some *marginal* improvements among some elements of the student body, have gotten nothing for it beyond more debt. America can’t wipe our asses for us, it’s not our mommy/daddy and we need to take responsibility for our lives and the lives of our children. And that means buckling down and making sure your kid is studying, doing their homework, **going to class** and in general giving two shits about their academic performance. No amount of money from the nanny state can fix that. Unfortunately, this problem is so deep and widely rooted I don’t know how the government *can* fix it.

In addition, the racial climate in America right now is just not conducive to discussions on a child’s poor performance. 69% of urban public schoolteachers in the United States are white. Using the New York state example, [https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/12/10/americas-public-school-teachers-are-far-less-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-than-their-students/ft_21-11-17_studentteacherrace_3/] (black and latino students are more then 40% more likely to have a white public-school teacher then one more congruent to their skin color (though how this takes into effect mixed race schoolteachers and mixed-race students I have no clue.). To be clear, I’d rather slam my hand in a door then get between *any* parent and their child. But it gets even harder when you’re a blonde, white woman telling a black parent/parents “hey x kid is a real shithead in class and doesn’t work hard, study, or in general attend.” without immediately losing the parents or at the very least, raising severely their hackles.

Parents are already extremely defensive about their children and then if you add the ugly history of race relations in America on top of it? Not a conducive environment for early interventions in troubled students lives. It’s the sad truth but you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. If the kid don’t care about reading, writing, or education in general you can’t force them to care. It has to come from the parent or guardian.

1ano790,CMV: Someone should leak “Coyote vs Acme” on the internet,"Warner Bros Discovery produced a Looney Tunes “Coyote vs Acme” film, produced by James Gunn and starring John Cena. In test screenings, the reactions were overwhelmingly positive by the audience. 

But WBD CEO David Zaslav decided that it would be better to never release the film for the company to get a tax off in its earnings. The movie is already finished and it’s just there, getting dust. 

My view: WBD doesn’t want to release the film themselves nor sell it to other studios. With that, it would be perfectly ok (although illegal) for someone to leak the film on the internet, just like they did with “Scooby and Krypto”, a movie that would have had the same fate if not for a leak. 

What would change my view: arguments that don’t revolve around the illegality of leaking and arguments that don’t revolve around “the film is WBD’s property and they should do what they want”.

they are CLEARLY a child or at least trying to portray a child and are attracted to children, fictional, anime, cartoons, dolls. is WEIRD. 

I don't think these people are going to go out and hurt real children or look for real cp.

1apbsy8,"CMV: Within 15 years, universal basic income will be a necessity as AI replaces the majority of jobs","We all know that AI usage has exploded in the last few years. While there is an undercurrent of fear regarding the eventual sentience of AI, the more practical and current concern is how AI will eventually change the job market.

Companies are now laying off employees and replacing them with AI, like [Google firing 30,000 employees](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-plans-layoff-30000-employees-fight-between-ai-humans-nath-esj8c/). While some have speculated that AI won't take over the majority of jobs, only improving workflow, I find this thought to be naive.

AI is not the printer press, the cotton gin, or the automobile. While those innovations did replace certain industries (the automobile made blacksmiths and ferriers unnecessary since everyone eventually stopped riding around in horse and buggy), they also created new industries that increased production within the overall job market.

This is not what AI does. AI does not simply make one or two industries obsolete; it has the potential to make the *majority* of human workers in most industries obsolete. It does not have the means to increase production beyond what it takes away from the job market.

This isn't simply, ""Oh you lost your job due to innovation? You should find new skills."" Because beyond labor workers (construction, trade skills, military, etc.), *all* skills can eventually be done by AI and done better.

And people are skeptical saying, ""Well, it can't write code write now."" or ""The blogs it writes are terrible."" While that may be so, the exponential growth means that AI will eventually be good enough to replace the majority of white collar and creative jobs.

It's not simply a new innovation. It will eventually be (and I presume very quickly) an entire restructuring of work. Why should companies pay actual humans that are falable when they hire however many workers to run the AI and produce whatever the organization needs for exponentially cheaper?

Eventually, and I'm guessing within 15 years, AI will reshape the job market to the point where universal basic income will become a necessity for people to simply get money and survive.

I'm hopeful that someone can change my view on this because I certainly don't want this to happen. I would like the majority of people to keep their jobs, but I currently don't see a future where one of three things happen:

1. UBI is mandated.
2. Laws are passed that require companies to have X% of human workers.
3. A combination of the two.",MiltonRoad17,336,0.7400000095367432,533,1707773885,2024-02-12 15:38:05,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1apbsy8/cmv_within_15_years_universal_basic_income_will/,2,2024

There's also a racial aspect to this. With the naacp launching a lawsuit against one school district who kept passing a student, all the way through getting a diploma, while the student was functionally illiterate. The case claimed his civil rights were denied because he was not given an education.

https://edsource.org/2022/the-right-to-read-it-took-a-lawsuit-against-california/678069

Worth noting, students in predominantly white districts are often held to very different standards in the same state. Certain behaviors are tolerated and worse yet, actually getting worse grades is considered passing. This creates two tiers of an education system that's also based on race to a degree. 

But it gets worse. Because these students then come out of high school knowing less, but they go on to college, often going into debt, and then they quit after realizing they're nowhere near the level which it takes to pass a college level course. This sets up these students for even worse prospects in life. Worth noting, this is also why California quietly ended affirmative action admissions years ago  at many state universities. It was having negative repercussions for students of color. 

https://www.npr.org/2023/06/30/1185226895/heres-what-happened-when-affirmative-action-ended-at-california-public-colleges

Students who have learning disabilities or need special help can also request it in this system. It's called an IEP and this allows for accommodations for their disability. So a student can get extra time, or individual tutoring should they fall behind. If they really want to, they're going to pass. 

And this isn't even touching on the grade inflation we've seen on the last couple decades. C level work is now considered A level. Curriculums have been dumbed down to the point where showing up and doing the bare minimum is enough. Well, fsr less than the bare minimum. The numbers themselves are pretty shocking. Whereas it's common for predominantly white school districts to have around 85% on grade level, in many cities across the us this drops to just 25% of black students in cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland. 

https://www.realcleareducation.com/articles/2022/11/24/large_racial_reading_and_math_performance_gaps_persist_as_children_age_110794.html

The answer isn't to continue to just pass everyone with a heartbeat, but have actual repercussions for students. Of course some accommodations should be made and in some instances students should be able to retake certain tests, but overall as it currently stands, there's not much a school will do to a student who is far below grade level, and also having multiple absences. The approach now is just to push them along. This creates a situation that's worse for everyone.

Some of these statistics show that in some places Islamic people are more likely to advocate Sharia.

This is in discourse around gender based violence, where the statistics show that men are responsible for the majority of rapes, sexual assaults etc.

However, basing your view on men as a group on statistics is as flawed as basing your opinion of Muslims, blacks, and anyone else on statistics. It's by definition prejudice, and shoobe called out.

Ignoring the fact that the US government would never in a million years even attempt this in the first place, even if they did, there are millions of unregistered guns that would just stay in the owner's possession and we'd never know.

Then you end up in a situation where all the registered gun owners have now given up their guns, but also know that most of the people they wanted to protect themselves from are still in possession of their unregistered guns, so the now gunless people will just find a gun via illegal means, and just keep it hidden at home.

It's almost like Neil expected an ""obviously no I wouldn't"" and was surprise that that wasn't the answer.

Honestly it's a bit ridiculous that not only was he expecting the answer to be no but also was surprised by the possibility of the answer being yes.

Like yes Neil, some people don't like the idea of being dead. That's surprising to you?

If anything it should be the more expected position for the average person until they say otherwise.

Anyways, I'm full on board with Larry here. Rip to him he died a while ago btw. I, like him, can't stand the idea of not being alive.

But I want to adress Neil's argument more here.

He says that the absence of death means a lack of urgency and why would you even get out of bed because there's always tomorrow.

I believe this is a dumb argument. If I lived forever I would maybe stay for longer in bed. But that means because I have more time I can relax more which is not a bad thing at all.

I don't think Neil would say this is a bad thing which means it's more likely he meant you would have people stay in bed for... ever?

Like never get out of bed? Spend all day eating popcorn and watching TV?

Ummm no Neil, people would still want to improve their lives today rather than tomorrow.

But perhaps it would be this year rather than next.

Like sure it would he easier to put things off but that doesn't mean I still wouldn't want to get things done. 

Besides if I do more per day with a finite life, that doesn't mean a finite life is going to make you do more.

An infinite life you could still do more if you work only 10% as hard, which again I'm not suggesting people will do.

So why the hell is a finite life better?

Infacy with a finite life your appreciation of your accomplishments will come to an end when your life is over.

With an infinite you can appreciate your life achievements for longer and you'll have more to appreciate.

1armn1r,Cmv: Kids are disrespectful toward the school system because it's disrespectful toward them.,"When I was in school I remember clearly, the overarching message coming from the teachers, staff, the entire school system in general was this: ""We don't care how you feel, we don't care what you think, you're here to do what we tell you to. If you don't do what we want, you're worthless to us."" 

Students who did poorly were often singled out and mentioned by name as examples of what not to be. Students who obviously came from neglectful homes were given no extra help or leniency, they were just treated as failures when they were clearly suffering and not allowed basic hygiene at home. How can you expect someone to get their work done when they don't even have a clean table at home? The students who were treated fairly were the ones who lived in the same subdivisions as the teachers, the ones who live in the neighborhood and who's parents hang out with the teachers as friends. 

There was a clear rift, if you could afford to live in the middle class subdivisions you were worth something and the teachers treated you like a person, if you couldn't afford to live there you were treated with disrespect. Poor kids were seen as a bad influence on the middle class subdivisioners, and so didn't deserve respect. They were always bad right from the start to the teachers. 

There were times I walked up to the teacher to ask for help, and they would stop and make me go away when one of their preferred students would come ask for help, or sometimes refuse to help at all. 

When I see teachers talk about problem students online they don't talk about the factors that cause them, and chock it up to ""lack of discipline.""

1arpifv,CMV: Leaving NATO would be one of the worst foreign policy decisions a President could make,"In case you haven't seen it, Reddit's favorite President, Donald John Trump, has been teasing the US stepping back from NATO, [telling his aids he's considering withdrawing America from the alliance](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html). It seems that MAGA conservatives and left-wing radicals alike are open to isolating the US from our NATO allies, which I think would be a generationally awful foreign policy blunder, ultimately resulting in bloody war in Europe. 

While this may have been a different discussion in early 2020, Putin has now made his imperial ambitions and willingness to wage war clear. His invasion of the sovereign state of Ukraine was an unprecedented violation of all the laws and norms of war Europe established after World War 2. Putin has made his ambition to recapture other former Soviet Republics clear, and it seems self-evident that the only thing stopping Putin from eventually invading NATO allies is his fear of triggering NATO's Article 5 and falling into a war with the United States.

While other NATO members have their own armies, they suck. [All other NATO allies combined have a smaller fighting force than Russia or the US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/584286/number-of-military-personnel-in-nato-countries/), and their technology and training are generally regarded as woefully inadequate. Turkey is the only other NATO ally with a decent army, but they're also the most unreliable in the alliance (along with Hungary). Without the guarantee of US mutual defense, I don't think that the threat of European NATO allies alone would be enough to deter further Russian expansion once they finish the war in Ukraine, and have the time to rebuild their army.

As always, I'm open to genuine folks trying to change my mind on this assessment. ",LilSebastiannn,700,0.8500000238418579,422,1708029453,2024-02-15 14:37:33,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1arpifv/cmv_leaving_nato_would_be_one_of_the_worst/,2,2024
1arqgnj,Cmv: People of colour absolutely can be racist,"The notion that black people and POC can’t be racist has become more prevalent in the last few years, usually explained by saying that racism is a system of oppression and because white people have not been traditionally systematically oppressed, they cannot be subject to racism.

My issue with this is that I believe people are mistaking racism with systematic oppression.

Racism as a word, to me at least  simply means prejudice based on race. Any prejudice that is based on someones race or ethnic background is an example of racism.

Systematic racism is a form of oppression based on racial characteristics, and it’s true that white people have rarely been held under these systems.

So the mistake people make is claiming that POC can’t be racist full stop, which is untrue, and actually a racist claim in itself. 

If somebody dislikes white people based on the colour of their skin or the acts of their ancestors that is racism in its rawest form, just like any other.",serialrimmer,606,0.7400000095367432,1211,1708031776,2024-02-15 15:16:16,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1arqgnj/cmv_people_of_colour_absolutely_can_be_racist/,2,2024

I am a current Criminal Justice student and I interact with a lot of police content, both from the pro and anti side. I've seen enough horrible things to fully support police reform in this country, especially in rural departments that still operate like it's 1960.

The view that I hold is that 6-8 weeks of training is NOT enough for law enforcement officers, period. This is my second semester and we are barley scratching the surface. We spent an entire week on Search and Seizure case law and that was just the intro class, there is way more to learn in Constitutional Law and Legal Ethics.

The concepts we're just starting to get into this semester are very complicated and nuanced and require vast amounts of context to fully understand. I can't fathom how a police officer can learn enough at the academy when most of the training hours are spent on tactics and police operations.

Is eight weeks enough time to learn how tactics, firearms, and operations? Yes!

Is there enough time left over after all that to get even a baseline understanding of the law? NO

1axovtd,CMV: For American Jews there is a de facto loyalty test to Israel to participate in vast majority Jewish spaces,"I'm an American Jew who was raised in the reform tradition. Been more and less connected to the broader Jewish community at various points in my life. As a grow older with a son of my own I would love to be more connected to the Jewish community, but I'm really turned off by the intense social pressure to uncritically support Israel. 

I don't agree with Israeli government policies both around Palestinians and the fact that Netanyahu is extremely right wing on many other issues as well. As a public school teacher my school is facing budget cuts because the government has ""no money"" but is sending Israel millions and millions of dollars every day. 

Besides that I'm an American citizen, I fail to see why my Jewishness should be contingent on my loyalty to a foreign country.  

When I go to mainstream Jewish spaces I feel intense social pressure to keep my mouth shut. If I were honest about my views I feel I would be ostracized. Mainstream Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation League have called Jews who dare to criticize Israel as ""self-hating""

I try to imagine this situation in any other ethnic group. Just imagining Chinese-Americans being called ""self-hating"" for not supporting the CCP. That would be insane. So why does it happen to Jews?

It was Hitler's viewpoint that Jews were secretly loyal to a foreign government. It's wild to me that mainstream American Jewish organizations have come around to essentially the same view - American Jews must support Israel or they are ""bad Jews.""

Anyway, I'm sad about what is going on Gaza - but also sad because I want to raise my child within the Jewish community and feel very disconnected right now.

1ay1eu3,CMV: Ned Stark should have told Catelyn Stark about Jon’s true parentage,"I get that it largely, widely, needed to be kept a secret for the stability of Ned and Robert Baratheon’s friendship, and the Stark/Baratheon alliance.

But Ned sort of tortured his wife with this lie, which lead to a shitty situation for Jon and Catelyn.  I feel like if Catelyn were ‘in on it’, she could have better endured the ‘indignity’ of The Honorable Ned Stark’s Bastard in her home. Catelyn wouldn’t have held so much venom towards Jon (a true innocent) for his whole life, and they may have even come up with a better plan for Jon than to simply ship him off to the wall.

I think Ned was not a shrewd operator, and emotionally stunted. But by sharing the burden of this massive, realm-shattering secret, he and Catelyn could have done better by Jon for Jon’s whole life.

So what was the downside? That Catelyn simply couldn’t be trusted? Would Catelyn have let the information slip in some way?  

Because I think Catelyn would have held the secret closely out of respect for Lyanna and love for her nephew. I think Catelyn would have raised Jon much more like one of her own, and been happier in doing so.

Is that the downside? That Catelyn would have been suspiciously warm to her husband’s bastard?

1az7dqj,"CMV: Trump'ism didn't manifest out of nowhere. The American people were conditioned, and ready to receive it.","I often hear talking heads trying to figure out the rise of Donald Trump, or try to explain his phenomenon. As if he simply arrived and corrupted everyone… a sweet innocent public.

My post is probably going to sound like a screed from the John Birch Society, but I have a lot of loose thoughts here.

There was a meanness and sickness to the culture at times, that we simply might have forgotten.

As someone who has followed politics, I can't stress how wild and nutty the Obama v. McCain election cycle was. Those McCain/Palin rallies were full of unhinged and crazy people. It's true that McCain was a relatively measured man, but the lines of people outside his rallies were pretty much the same MAGA people without the label yet. They were the eventual “tea party” people. I've never believed the myth that rank & file MAGA loyalists were non-political and simply got woke up in 2016.

It's the same usual suspects. They have just put their former campaign accouterments in storage.

There was a nastiness in popular culture for a while. 

All those daytime talk shows like Jerry Springer were common on all the networks. Go back and watch clips of these shows. Audience members take the microphone and call people on a panel, “BIG FAT SLUTTY PIGS!” to the roar of the crowd.

I was a massive Howard Stern radio show fan. An era where he would get disabled people to fight with the Klu Klux Klan, or openly use the “n-word” on terrestrial radio. Trump was a frequent guest.

There were just a lot of sleazy things that wouldn't be around today. A popular television commercial was for “Bum Fights,” a mail order VHS where someone got homeless people to attack each other.

Never mind Tucker going to Russia. Late '90s and early 2000s political media was horrendous. Anyone remember MSNBC's Michael Savage? He was telling people to get AIDS on TV.

This was the tone of the media. Bush v. Kerry was a wild and crazy election cycle, too. I remember Zell Miller challenging Chris Mathews to a duel on live television, or Ann Coulter calling Al Gore a ""f*g"" on TV, without much notice in pre-Twitter world.

Trump comes from celebrity popular culture. My first board game as a child was a Donald Trump one. He comes from this world.

He was a character. Comedy Central did a celebrity roast for him right before he became a candidate. They've never re-aired it, and simply pretend it never existed. Most of the jokes were about how he could grab any “pussy” he wanted because he was rich.

Trump was a long-planted seed that finally produced fruit. I've known that some populist crazy celebrity was going to eventually arrive. WWF wrestlers were becoming Governor in Minnesota.

I can't feign my poor virgin Puritan eyes and ears weren't ready for Trump, and it shocked me.

1azmbbp,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,"
I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating.",GorrilaRuffy,308,0.5699999928474426,1619,1708862489,2024-02-25 06:01:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1azmbbp/cmv_dating_is_objectively_harder_for_men_than_it/,2,2024

1b1i1rf,"CMV: The Palestine supporter who killed himself was a father, and for that reason I believe his act was selfish ","I am referring to the man who lit himself on fire while proclaiming “free palestine”. 
   
When I heard he left behind a child I really felt he acted selfishly.
   
I do believe a father can lay down his life for the greater good in a worthy circumstance. But the bar is very high. 
   
I dont believe his act will affect the status of Palestinian freedom. And I believe it would be reasonable for him to conclude this assuming he wasnt wrapped up in self righteousness or delusions of grandeur.
   
Another thing - the Israeli Palestine conflict was already mainstream global news. He hasnt shed any more light on an obscure story. Its already covered and saturated by awareness.
   
As for your children… Its one thing to leave behind loved ones - that hurts them and leaves them less than they were with you in their life.
   
Its another to leave behind children. You have a responsibility to your children to take care of them and provide them love and a knowledge of how to make it in the world.
   
There are ways you can improve the world without abandoning the most vulnerable kind of person possible that needs you - you directly. 
   
Ultimately the act becomes a shock symbol of how much he values his opinion on the conflict. We all get to stand back and admire how much conviction he had - how far he would go to make a statement about a current event - which will ultimately do nothing but rob his child of a parent.

1b1m9yc,CMV: unconditional love is an impossible goal,"Context: I've recently had a conversation about this topic with an acquaintance. She seems to have very impossible standards for relationships (think of that awful quote that goes ""if you can't handle me at my worst you don't deserve me at my best"" type of thing), and is struggling to find and keep relationships. I tried pointing out some of her unrealistic expectations and she wasn't having it.

That got me thinking about the phrase ""unconditional love"" and that I really think all love is conditional. I think a lot of people would be happier and less frustrated if they accepted this as a fact. 

Additional context: I'm happily married and have a child. I love them dearly and they love me. However in my wildest, darkest imagination, I'm sure there are horrible acts and situations that could cause them to stop loving me and vice versa. I plan to never get into one of those situations but I think everyone has their limits. In fact, I think I act like a better partner when I acknowledge that my actions could negatively affect my partner to the point that they may no longer want to be with me (again, not planning to ever get to that point). 

I also think pushing for unconditional love can lead to pushing for unhealthy relationship dynamics. Like a person is allowed to make mistakes and not be  perfect, but they also have to take responsibility and make real changes to their behavior, if it's a serious and/or ongoing issue.

Perhaps I am too cynical or missing some other perspective, so there is a chance my view could be changed there. I do feel like I might be seeing this a bit pessimistically or maybe I'm focusing too much on my friend's personal issues.

1b2o53w,CMV: it is impossible to ethically accumulate and deserve over a billion dollars,"Alright, so my last post was poorly worded and I got flamed (rightly so) for my verbiage. So I’ll try to be as specific in my definitions as possible in this one.

I personally believe that someone would hypothetically deserve a billion dollars if they 1. worked extremely hard and 2. personally had a SUBSTANTIAL positive impact on the world due to their work. The positive impact must be substantial to outweigh the inherent harm and selfishness of hoarding more wealth than one could ever spend, while millions of people starve and live in undignified conditions.

Nowadays there are so many billionaires that we forget just what an obscene amount of money that is. Benjamin Franklin’s personal inventions and works made the world a better place and he became rich because of it. Online sources say he was one of the 5 richest men in the country and his lifetime wealth was around $10mil-$50mil. I would say he deserved that wealth because of the beneficial material impact his work had on the people around him. Today there are around 3-4 thousand billionaires in the world, and none of them have had a substantial enough positive impact to deserve it.

Today, there are many people working hard on lifesaving inventions around the world. However, these people will likely never make billions. If the research department of a huge pharma company comes up with a revolutionary cancer treatment, the only billionaires who will come out of it are the owners and executives. If someone single-handedly cured cancer, and made a billion from it, I would say that is ethical and deserved. But that is a practical impossibility in the world today. Money flows up to those who are already ultra-rich, and who had little to do with the actual achievement, in almost all cases.

On entertainment: there are many athletes, musicians, and other entertainers who have amassed billions. I recognize that entertainment is valuable and I do think they deserve to be rich, but not billionaires. That’s just too much money and not enough impact.

Top athletes are very talented, hardworking, and bring a lot of joy to their fans. I don’t think they bring enough joy to justify owning a billion dollars. If Messi single-handedly cured depression in Argentina, I’d say he deserves a billion. There’s nothing you can do with a sports ball that ethically accumulates that much money.

Yes, a lot of that money comes from adoring fans who willingly spend their money to buy tickets and merch. Michael Jordan has made over $6 billion in royalties from Nike. But I would argue that there is little ethical value in selling branded apparel or generating revenue based on one’s persona or likeness. It’s not unethical, but it doesn’t change the world for the better. MJ deserves to be rich but doesn’t deserve billions. I’m open to debate on this.

My general point here is that if you look at any list of billionaires, the vast majority are at the top of massive companies and profit directly or indirectly off of the labor of others. You could say that’s just how to world works but that doesn’t mean it’s right. I don’t think there is any person who has individually contributed enough to the betterment of the world in their lifetime and has also amassed a billion dollars. I am open to any particular billionaires and their work that might change my mind. I also should say that this is a strongly held belief of mine so I would be hard pressed to offer deltas but I absolutely will if someone provides an example of one person who has made a billion that deserves it.",champagne_papaya,687,0.7200000286102295,945,1709171094,2024-02-28 19:44:54,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b2o53w/cmv_it_is_impossible_to_ethically_accumulate_and/,2,2024

1b47poh,CMV: At will employment should be illegal. ,"Unless you're independently wealthy, most of us are one lay-off/firing/workplace injury away from living on the streets and having our lives absolutely turned upside down by a job loss.

I've been working for 40+ years now and I've seen people get unjustly fired for all kinds of shit. Sometimes for even just doing their jobs. 

I’ve done some human resources as well, within a few of my rules, and I’ve been asked to do some very unsavory things, like do a PIP plan for somebody they just don’t like, or for other reasons I won’t mention. If an employer doesn’t like you for whatever reason, they can just do up a PIP plan and you’re out a week later. And you’ve got no leg to stand on. You could even be doing your job, and they will let you go.

America is the only country that has Atwill employment. We are so behind and we favor the employer so much, that it puts everyone else at risk. Fuck that.

Unemployment only lasts so long and getting a job with the same salary as your previous one can take some time (years for some people).

The fact that you can get fired for sneezing the wrong way is bullshit. If you live in a state with at will employment laws you can be terminated at any time, for any reason and sometimes no reason at all. I live in Texas, and they can fire you for whatever reason. Even if the boss is sexually harassing you, even if they don’t like the color of your skin, no lawyer will help you at all and it will cost thousands and thousands of dollars even begin to sue the company, and most of the time you just lose, because you can never prove it.

Don't get me wrong, I've seen this go the other way too, where company's are too lax on problem employees and let them hang around. I just don't think with how much most people dedicate their lives to their jobs that they can just be let go for no reason and pretty much no recourse.

I think there should be an independent employment agency that deals with employee lay offs and terminations. For example, it would be like civil court, where a judge/jury looks at the facts from both parties (employer and employee) and then makes a decision from there. I know you can sue in civil court for wrongful termination, but having an agency strictly dedicated to employment issues would be more helpful for the average person (you have to have deep pockets to sue, and most people don't have that).

Side unpopular opinion: You shouldn't have to give two weeks notice before you move on from your job. If your company can dump you at any moment without telling you, the social expectation should be the other way as well.

1b56cgq,CMV: climbing Mount Everest is worthless and shows a level of narcissism and selfishness,"Climbing Mount Everest is a useless accomplishment and also shows a level of narcissism and selfishness, that people need to recognize. 

Basically, climbing Mount Everest achieves nothing practical. If people went up to Mount Everest to research things or collect things I could respect it more. I get that it is technically an achievement since it's hard, but it's such a ridiculous risk to your life and well-being. I think the main thing that bothers me is that you are risking your life for something so worthless. If you are going to risk your life for something, go become a firefighter or donate your kidney.

Things like: writing a book, completing a degree, knitting a shirt, cooking a meal, or getting a driver's licence have an end result. You've either made something or learned something. 

Whereas climbing Mount Everest is just literally going up somewhere and then coming back down. It's about as practical as going up the stairs, standing there for five seconds and then coming back down, and repeating the process ten thousand times. Except by doing that I don't risk dying.

I can sort of appreciate people who run marathons. I mean, it's equally useless, but it's far more safe I'm not necessarily against people doing something useless for fun but I'm just  wondering if it is the best use of your time. 

Mount Everest has a death rate of between one to five percent of all climbers. That is just the number of deaths of people who attempt to climb at all. Of the people who manage to make it past 8000m, 14 % die. 

For comparison:

running a marathon kills 1 in 259,000 of all who attempt it. 

Skydiving kills 1 in 500,000 of all who attempt it. 

Boxing is the second most deadly sport at 1 death per 7000. 

Climbing Mount Everest has a death rate of 1 in 50, and it increases to 1 in 10 once you approach the summit. 

The risk vs. reward does not pan out. A 1 in 10 chance of death just so you can say ""I climbed Mount Everest.” IT’s narcissistic and selfish and should not be rewarded.

1b5p0bh,"CMV: All video games should have an easy mode, and those who use it shouldn’t be embarrassed to do so.","Don’t get me wrong, I love a hard game. I am a big fan of games like Hollow knight and have been trying for quite a while to beat Baldur’s Gate in Honour Mode. But…

I think all games should have an easy mode/setting and you’re a bit of a dickhead if you make fun of people who do use easy mode. 
Video Games should be available to everyone, when the mechanics of a game are too hard for someone they should have the option to make it easier so they can at enjoy the other aspects of a game like the art and storyline.
On the flip side I also think there should be an option for a “Hero Mode/Hard Mode” for the people who want an even harder experience, and would still allow for that badge of honour for beating the game still an option.
 
I’ve heard from people about how they didn’t play Dark Souls or Eldin Ring (aka any “souls like games”) because of the game difficulty and that just seems like such a shame to me that so many people miss out on the rest of the game because they can’t enjoy the combat. Not only is that a loss for the player but for the people who worked on those aspects of the game.
May it be the casual gamer, a beginner, a child, people with disabilities…etc. they should have just as much of a chance to enjoy a game as the seasoned gamer.

I don’t really think I need to explain why I’d call someone a dickhead for making fun of people who do use easy mode, but I’ll say it anyways. Lots of people don’t have the time, abilities or want to be good at video games and that doesn’t make them any less than anyone who is good at games. Different people, different hobbies. Don’t discourage people from enjoying the art form of video games just because you have mastered the combat and think you’re better because of that. Yeah yeah, I get it you’re the master at Sekiro but at least John who plays Stardew is actually fun to talk to. 

So in conclusion, I think every game should have an easy mode. It would be decently simple to change without having to uproot the entire gameplay by changing player and enemy HP, starting weapons/armour, more save points… etc. 
I don’t think we should be making games easier in general, it should still be a source of pride for people who finally get past the challenges of games but that shouldn’t be reason to not have a mode for those who still want to enjoy the rest of the game. So have a Easy, Classic and hard mode in games and have them be open and fun for everyone.

1b6pvbf,"Cmv: The biggest reason why people think of Vanilla ice cream as basic is because how it looks, not how it tastes.","If vanilla ice cream wasn’t a plain white color, people would not call it basic. Strawberry and Chocalate are arguably more basic flavors, but people don’t say that because of their colors and them not being plain white. I guarantee that if vanilla ice cream was purple or something but it had the same taste, it would not be called basic.

Strawberry within itself is a pretty basic flavor too. There are a million things out that are strawberry flavored, and strawberry ice cream doesn’t taste that differently from a lot of those, making it by definition pretty basic and not really standing out much. Vanilla isn’t as common as a flavor, especially not outside of desserts, so it’s less basic than strawberry in that aspect. The same thing can be applied to chocolate flavor (I am aware of many different variations of chocolate ice cream such as mint, caramel, etc but chocolate in itself is not considered basic).

Because of this, I guarantee that if vanillia ice cream looked more pretty and not as plain, it wouldn’t be considered as such especially when taking into account that other more basic ice cream flavors aren’t treated the same.",NewRedSpyder,514,1.0,145,1709595129,2024-03-04 17:32:09,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6pvbf/cmv_the_biggest_reason_why_people_think_of/,3,2024
1b7dge6,"CMV: A racist action does not need to be a product of systemic racism to still be racism. ie: racism against white people is racism, just not systemic.","Some context: I am a white man, my girlfriend is an indigenous women earning her master's in indigenous governance. This is a heated discussion we have had a couple times. This post will not be used as a defense of my stance, just an alternative view point for me to learn her view point.

I believe that racism, on its own is described as any judgement of a person solely based on their skin color, ancestry, race, etc. This does exclude white people.

I understand that racism for many people is systemic. I am aware of redlining, residential schools, generational trauma, racist school funding practices, and so forth.

I try to convey that the viewpoints I hear on systemic racism being a product exclusively by white people are extremely north american centric and that these arguements fly out the window the moment you land in Japan or Iran or many other countries. To be clear, that does not invalidate that white people are exclusively at fault for north american systemic racism.

I believe that racism and systemic racism are not synonymous but rather that systemic racism is a further defined type of racism. It just happens to be much more prevailent than plain racism. 

I also want to be clear that though there are people arguing that white people are victims of racism en masse, that is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about solo white kids at a black school getting bullied. I'm talking about a white guy working for an indigenous company having his co workers belittle his work.

1b7hpk5,CMV: Prostitution is not immoral. Prostitution should be legal.,"CMV: Prostitution should be legal. Prostitution itself is not immoral. 

I’ll start this by saying there is a difference between a willing prostitute/escort and a sex slave/human trafficking victim.

The whole prostitution industry should be legalized and regulated for harm reduction. I don’t think either side is evil just because the law states it is. At one point there were laws that were horrific and immoral but still the law-doesn’t mean they are right. If it was legalized, there will still probably be a black market and nefarious players in the game but legalizing it and having safer alternatives to the current situation is ideal and would reduce harm.
Pimps would have less leverage and escorts would be safer and could make a living in peace. 

A common argument I see people make is that prostitute addicts are using the money to score drugs so it’s wrong. 

1.) Not all escorts are addicts. Some of them just want money, new designer bags and material expenses to be covered. They can use their looks and sexuality because it has value. Much like how a beautiful actor or model can cash in on their appearance they should be able to do the same without the same ridicule and law enforcement threat.

2.) This common argument falls flat because there are addicts working 9-5 construction jobs, working as strippers, bartenders, bankers, lawyers and none of those professions and employers come under the same scrutiny the same way for “feeding an addiction. Addiction is a brutal lifestyle that effects everyone from every industry and all walk of life but it is on people to not do dope and if they are already on it, it’s their sole responsibility to get clean. Addiction is often rooted in trauma and I do have empathy and can understand that and feel bad for people in grips of that life but I do not think it warrants keeping the sex industry illegal. I don’t see the correlation. 

You can have sex, that’s fine.
You can pay people to do stuff, that’s also fine. But the second you pay someone to have safe sex it becomes wrong and illegal in societies eyes. The buyers and sellers of this industry should be protected.

It’s somehow legal to pay people to have sex but only if you’re recording it and making porn? The rules around it are not sound is what I’m saying therefore it should be updated and legalized for the safety and wellbeing of everyone involved. Is it the best thing you could be doing? No. But neither is drinking alcohol, smoking, gambling etc. We’ve legalized many vices that are arguably more harmful. I’m open to having my mind changed but as of right now I don’t really see a big issues with sex work.

Why do you move to let’s say Norway and you’re an extreme Orthodox Jew, Sharia supporting Muslim and want to imply your rules and living standard to that country? 

Why can’t you adapt since you want to move elsewhere, you can’t move to a not so religious country and then want certain areas to be for different genders, have different clothings etc and create a whole different culture in that country, why don’t you just move to those countries that allow such things?

Like for example in Iran there’s tons of women who want to get the fuck out because of the discrimination towards womens freedoms and rights, yet people want to imply those rules in other non religion countries.  

There’s people who are sadly born into these extreme religions and are brainwashed into thinking it’s ok and normal to for example hide your whole face, not being in the same room, area or restaurant with the opposite gender and now we’ve created a bigger segregation between the ethnic group and those people (when I saw ethnic group I include those who have immigrated but have adapted to the country’s culture and values)

Like for example here in London people want sharia law and that for example says that if a woman gets raped then there needs to be 4 male witnesses or else it’s invalid. There’s people who are born in a country who doesn’t have these values but are still brainwashed into thinking it’s okay and I think you should move to that country that allows it and let those who want to escape such living situations escape it. 

I can’t tell you how many people have been killed in non religious countries because their sister had a boyfriend or because they didn’t cover their knees like are you serious.

To be honest I think you should only be allowed to practice your religion behind closed doors and not bring it to the public, and if you don’t like it why not move? I don’t want to hear prayers, see discriminatory clothes and eventually dangerous laws.

It's well known that these settlements are a major roadblock to a cohesive Palestinian state and a significant detrimant to any kind of peaceful solution in the region.

1bapzpn,CMV: Most people in the US are completely deranged about sex and nudity,"The title speaks for itself really, but to elaborate:

* Most Americans have negative overreactions to sex and nudity that are disconnected from any potential harm.
* While sex and nudity can cause harm, e.g. a flasher is sexually harassing people, not everyone who is nude is a flasher. Being able to differentiate nonsexual nudity from sexual nudity and from someone using nudity to harass is a skill most Americans lack.
* This lack of differentiation then gets scaremongered into overreactive policies and everyone being accused of being a sexual predator, in a similar way to 9/11 lead to random innocent people being accused of being terrorists and security theater becoming the norm, with the usual preoccupation with protecting 'normal Americans' from outsiders via norms and propriety - ""we don't do that here"" - rather than real harm reduction focused on real threats.
* Children are as usual weaponized as an excuse to police the actions of others, instead of teaching children age appropriate lessons about sex and nudity to prepare them for public life.
* Not talking openly about sexuality nor educating people beyond the mechanics of sex leads to many Americans not understanding what their own sexuality is and being unable to understand sensual, sexual or romantic expression and how these interact with the public realm.
* This becomes a cultural vicious circle: people are told nudity is bad, told that it's not normal, so they don't expect it, so they feel surprised and scared by it, so they feel it's bad.
* Younger Americans are often additionally hamstrung by absorbing discourse around private sexual consent that does not include the public sphere, leading them to think that they can 'not consent' to other people doing things they don't want to see. Combined with young people's general distaste for older bodies, this becomes ""that old person is creepy"" as code for accusing them of sexual harassment.
* Some in the US kink communites have tried to assuage the fears of the average American, unfortunately lending them further confidence that they are correct because the kink community 'agrees' with them, ignoring that this came from pragmatism.
* The US rightwing are even more poisonous with their fears about sexuality, even going so far as thinking dancing in public is evidence of pedophilia if they think the dancing is too sexy (or black).
* People in other countries are also just as bad as the US or worse; this post isn't saying *only* the USA has issues with puritanism.

If that's the case, then individual white people can't be racist either. White person hurling racial slurs at ethnic minorities? Not racist, because an individual is not a racist! In fact by this definition, racist hate crimes can't exist, period, because they're perpetrated by individuals, not institutions.

I say this as a very left-leaning person who wholeheartedly believes that institutional racism is very real, and white people absolutely do not have to deal with some of the difficulties that brown people do because of it.

Considering the amount of close contact between humans, especially hunters and deer, a human contracting this disease seems like a matter of time. Human to human spread would be apocalyptic.

1bde6ww,CMV: It's not unreasonable to be sad or even depressed over a lack of sex.,"So hear me out, human's at the end of the day are animals with a drive to get that special serotonin boost that comes from sex. When someone is unable to get sex, they are doing something that goes against every evolutionary imperative we have. 

Aside from that being able to create and maintain relationships with other human's is a normal social skill that if you are lacking it makes you abnormal. No matter how you slice, it, it is not normal to be unable to form relationships. If this applies to friendships, it should make sense that it apply to romantic relationships as well. 

Romantic relationships are considered a normal part of social development that starts at youth. There's a reason why if someone is a 40 year old man who's never dated or had sex (exculding celibate or asexual people) they will get weird looks. Relationships, and by an extension sex is something that most humans expect to have at some point in their life, and it's a decently reasonable expectation. When you are say 20 and all your friends have dated and had sex, it can be distressing as you see the people around you progressing in a way you are failing to.

You begin to question what is wrong with you and why women don't like you in that way. I know some people say ""if you can't get laid it's 100% your fault 100% of the time"" but some people are just genuinely unlucky. If you believe it's possible for bad things to happen to good people, it's not consistent that someone unable to date is 100% at personal fault. 

Anyways, like I said earlier, you question why and what's wrong with you. Your self esteem takes a hit because it's literally a judgement of you and your attractiveness. It also get's worse as years go on. I'm a 23 year old virgin, I felt a lot less distressed about my inability to attract a woman at 18 than I do now. It's like interest, but sadness.

1bdtc23,Cmv: I don't believe a friend cheating on their partner means I should cut the friend off,"I saw a post this morning on AITA regarding someone asking their partner not to allow their groomsman to bring their affair partner to the wedding. I totally agree with that because the woman who was cheated on was in the wedding party as well.
The part I don't agree with is the many comments stating that the soon to be husband should reconsider his friendship with his friend because he cheated.
In my opinion being a bad partner does not automatically equate to being a bad friend, father, sibling etc. Cheating is horrible and I am not trying to excuse it but I couldn't rationalize cutting off a friend for it, unless they roped me into it or had me cover for them unknowingly.
Edit: So far in this thread cheating has been compared to murder, kicking a dog, domestic/child abuse, and rape. Basically if your not ostracizing a cheater you might as sell support all of that as well. Also your partner will probably end up cheating on you.

1bfeuhy,CMV: Some of the differences between men and women in gymnastics are outdated and should be changed,"While I understand that men vs women gymnastics are different sports that focus on different types of physicality, there are still differences that I think are outdated:

1. I think that all gymnasts should be given a much wider range of attire choices. Male gymnasts should be allowed to wear leotards/unitards, while female gymnasts should be allowed to wear pants/shorts. It's especially important for women because often female gymnasts in leotards are sexualised, or couldn't perform if they are on their periods.

2. Remove the need for music and dance elements for women's floor apparatus. I think it should be optional for both men and women to include music or dance elements. Some people enjoy the choreography element of gymnastics while others don't. I don't see how that's relevant to how good a gymnast is.

3. Men should have rhythmic gymnastics, like this [video here](https://youtu.be/EQ-sorX193g?si=TBp0TftKxo3CYqmQ). I think it'd be a great addition for men to showcase the more artistic side of gymnastics. The physicality focused and the apparatus used will likely be different, but that's okay as it suits the appeal of a different set of athletes.

4. I don't know if this is doable, but I think men and women should have the same number of apparatus, probably five. I don't know how appealing this is but I think it's an outdated notion that women can only use 4 apparatus while men can use 6.",WheatBerryPie,403,1.0,142,1710511849,2024-03-15 09:10:49,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bfeuhy/cmv_some_of_the_differences_between_men_and_women/,3,2024
1bgdwgz,CMV: Israel is responsible for providing and allowing sufficient aid into Gaza,"1. When a party occupies the territory of another party, the occupier has the responsibility to provide aid to the civilians. Israel is no exception. They have air superiority and significant IDF presence in Gaza, they are occupying Gaza and therefore they have the responsibility to provide aid. America provided sufficient aid to Afghanistan and Iraq when they invaded those countries, and Israel is no exception.

2. The only reliable way to let aid in is through the land crossings, which Israel has a monopoly over. Even though Egypt technically controls the Rafah crossing, nothing can go through without Israel's green light. It's Israel's responsibility to make sure aid from other countries are allowed into Gaza.

Does Hamas has some responsibility too? Yes, but it's unlikely that they have enough aid to provide for millions of Gazans, and they don't control the land borders like Israel does. 

The situation on the ground is absolutely dire and desperate. Not providing or at least allowing sufficient aid into Gaza is immoral and inhumane. It amounts to at best collective punishment, at worst genocidal (a word I don't use lightly).

1bgrusp,"CMV: As a left-winger, we were wrong to oppose nuclear power","This post is inspired by this news article: [CSIRO chief warns against ‘disparaging science’ after Peter Dutton criticises nuclear energy costings](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/15/csiro-peter-dutton-gencost-report-nuclear-energy-renewables-cost)

When I was in year 6, for our civics class, we had to write essays where we picked a political issue and elaborate on our stance on it. I picked an anti-nuclear stance.

But that was 17 years ago, and a lot of things have changed since then, for the worse:

* [Australia became the first country to vote in a government to remove a carbon tax](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/17/australia-kills-off-carbon-tax) \- illustrating that progress on climate action can be reversed
* [Germany is expanding coal mining](https://euobserver.com/green-economy/157364) because of a shortage of Russian gas - illustrating that many countries are not yet ready to completely switch to renewables
* The recent wave of climate protests in Australia [only backfired because it led to us losing our right to protest](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/05/30/australias-crackdown-climate-activists)

There are many arguments to be made against nuclear power. A poorly-run nuclear power plant can be a major safety hazard to a wide area. Nuclear can also be blamed for being a distraction against the adoption of renewable energy. Nuclear can also be criticised for further enriching and boosting the power of mining bosses. Depending on nuclear for too long would result in us exhausting our Uranium reserves. 

But unfortunately, to expect a faster switch to renewables is just wishful thinking. This is the real world, a nasty place of political manoeuvring, compromises and climate change denial. Ideally, we'd switch to renewables faster (especially here in Australia where we have a vast surplus of renewable energy potential), but there are a lot of people (such as right-wing party leader Peter Dutton) standing against that. However, they're willing to make a compromise made where nuclear will be our ticket to lowering carbon emissions. What point is there in blocking a ""good option"" (nuclear) in favour for a ""best option"" (renewables) that we've consistently failed to implement on a meaningful scale? 

Even if you still oppose nuclear power after all this, nuclear at worst is a desperate measure, and [we are living in desperate times](https://theconversation.com/climate-tipping-points-are-nearer-than-you-think-our-new-report-warns-of-catastrophic-risk-219243).

1bgukwq,CMV: Dating has become more of a chore than it supposedly being fun ,"Note: I am not American, so I am not basing culture culture off dating in America, but just generally about dating. 

Take a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/s/Eg6c0W7LEn) and you will see how taxing dating has become. 

Dating apps are basically useless for men, even for men who get some matches because women on dating apps aren’t even exactly looking to go on dates, at this point it seems like women are seeking validation and an ego boost from the tons of matches they get. 

The dating standards have become ludicrous at this point, and no, it is not “incel” to point out how the extremely high standards that a lot of women are holding for men is ridiculous. 

That’s the equivalent of me wanting a super model who vibes with me but I can’t even give anything in return. Thats exactly what dating has become now. Women seek men who are in the ‘top percentages’, but what do they provide in return? 

They are problematic and want to be treated like ‘passenger princesses’, and expect men to be both “modern and traditional” at the same time. 

Dating would have remained *simpler* if dating apps didn’t exist, but these dating apps and even social media has completely warped women’s minds because of the tons of attention women get from DM’s, and likes on Instagram and those sort. 

And a lot of the older men who will probably read this post will never understand the struggles of younger men today who are trying to date, because you never grew up in an era where women hold men to such ridiculous standards and even the average men are being seen as disposable and useless. 

At this point why even bother trying to date? Might as well stay single forever, focus on my career, take care of my parents and get a dog.

Change my view and tell me why dating isn’t a chore in today’s age, especially for younger men.

That being said, I think men need to come together a bit more and support each other. Women like confident, ""sunny"" men, right? How does a sad ""loser"" guy develop this personality? He can do this my hanging out with more male friends, and then as he gains confidence also expand his circle to include more female friends.  


Yeah, I know dating apps are terrible. I know there is some kind of ""loneliness"" epidemic. But many men are way too tunnel-visioned on sex or even dating, when I think they are neglecting how awesome they would feel if they had a bunch of best bros backing them up.

1bik8yd,CMV: Arabs/Muslims are the colonizers and privileged group throughout the entire Middle East ,"So in the west we see white Christian’s hold this status of power in society. 

We see the same in the Middle East with Muslims/arabs. There are so many minority groups that have been persecuted and simply exterminated throughout the Middle East through Islamization and arabization. Assyrians, Kurds, Christians, Zoroastrians, bahais, coptics, Druze, etc. 

We see these groups having to hide their identities

It’s interesting because we often paint the Arabs/muslims with the same brush as people of color and oppressed minorities. We also say that Arabs lived in peace over there until the west got involved, but cmon that is so far from the truth. There has been war and ethnic cleansing in the Arab world since forever. Christianity was the main culprit for awhile until Islam took over then Christianity again then Islam again. And now it’s mainly Muslim. Except for one controversial state (Israel) 

Arabs have been colonizing the berbers in North Africa and Kurds in Iraq, Syria and Iran. 

So although the onset and creation of the state of Israel is controversial, it is interesting to see how many minority groups in the Middle East actually support Israel, unlike the average Muslim/arab in the Middle East. Sure, Israel was made by Ashkenazi Jews, but many many Jews all over the Middle East found refuge in the state of Israel. And why is it through out the Middle East we see Muslim controlled countries. They are not democracies, and if they are, they severely restrict rights and Islam is very much the ruling power. (Albeit a few) 

You may argue and say “that is their culture and we should respect it” but that is the majority (now) culture, that isn’t the only culture/religion/ethnic group.

Arabs have a history of brutal slavery and colonization. So why do we often group them in with oppressed group? 

(Gaza is a different scenario, as they are clearly oppressed today. But again, they were used as pawns by the Arab world to prevent a minority group from gaining any power … the jews) 

And let’s not forget about dhimmi hood in the Islamic religion, anyone who ain’t Muslim is seen as a second class citizen and isn’t represented, pays jizzyah tax, etc.

1bioj6s,CMV: Libertarianism is perhaps one of the most naive viewpoints a person can have.,"To me it's pretty simple: people are selfish. If you know anything at all about human nature, you should know that humans are selfish people, that powerful people will use their power for their own ends if they can.

Libertarian belief is built around the assumption that if you allow people the freedom to regulate everything on their own, without any government intervention of any kind, we'll all be way better off. Blow away all regulations, any attempts by a greater entity to stop people from exploiting each other, and the end result will be a much better society where free markets have properly calibrated the value of everything and nobody will be exploiting each other at all!

Like, come on. You really don't think that someone's going to figure out a way to fleece you out of your money? We talk about roads a lot in reference to libertarianism, how ""we don't need the government to build roads for us"". Okay, let's say we leave road-building entirely to citizen-owned businesses. One particularly savvy roadbuilder figures out a way to convince people that HIS roads are better than everyone else's, and he succeeds. How / why? Because who gives a fuck about roads? Who is going to do their due diligence to know whether it's really true when a guy says ""well my road is made of 325X multi-plastinate gloobablop which is a far superior material""? Salesmen are great at convincing people that things are true when they probably just aren't, but if they succeed, voila, now they dominate the industry, and now that they've got all the money, they can probably use that money to shut down everyone else, out-advertise them, establish their monopoly, and now they can charge as much as they want to build their roads. You say that some other company can slide in with cheaper prices, but you're forgetting some really well-known things about humanity: people are stupid, people are lazy, people are suckers. The big monopoly company can easily push their own propaganda that their own material is superior and still have a stranglehold on the business.

I feel like anyone with the most basic understanding of humanity would understand why libertarianism would never work. That's why I've always viewed any libertarian as extremely naive and just not very smart, certainly not the least bit aware of how the world actually works.

1bissk6,"CMV: most people who dislike centrists/moderates don’t want them to pick A side, they want them to pick THEIR side.","I want to start this off by saying that I would not call myself a moderate, I probably fall more in the classical liberalism camp. I believe that a lot of times whenever people criticize centrists/moderates they don’t even know what they are talking about, thinking that centrists want a compromise on every issue ever. This is not what a centrist is. 

While a centrist may indeed be more likely to admit that they don’t have enough information on a topic to form an opinion (that’s an incredibly wise thing to do, by the way, much better than just picking a side and not knowing what you’re talking about), that’s not what centrism is.

Centrism is having political positions on different topics which could be either considered liberal or conservative, putting their median position in the middle. For example, if you ask a centrist about abortion, gun control, higher taxes, and about universal healthcare, they might be pro-life, anti-gun control, pro-universal healthcare, and think we ought to raise taxes, that would make them, on average, in the middle. Centrists aren’t centrist on issues, they’re centrists on average.

I think most people understand this but pretend not to. It is perfectly fine to dislike centrism on that merit, but it seems that most people tend to distort what centrism is, turning it into a strawman. As seen in a popular comic which I am sure you have seen, a centrist is inbetween the KKK and members of the civil rights movement holding a sign that says “compromise?”

People on the left have used this comic to say “the kkk is the right wing and the civil rights movement is the left wing, and so they’re letting it happen!” Which is multiple straw men in one argument. The fact that this is such a repeated argument shows that they don’t hate moderates because they are moderates, they hate them because they’re not leftists. Same thing goes for the right wing.

1bivpa0,CMV: There's nothing wrong with schools teaching kids about gay people,"There is a lot of controversy nowadays about schools teaching about homosexuality and having gay books in schools, etc. Personally, I don't have an issue with it. Obviously, I don't mean straight up teaching them about gay sex. But I mean teaching them that gay people exist and that some people have two moms or two dads, etc.

Some would argue that it should be kept out of schools, but I don't see any problem with it as long as it is kept age appropriate. It might help combat bullying against gay students by teaching acceptance. My brother is a teacher, and I asked him for his opinion on this. He said that a big part of his job is supporting students, and part of that is supporting his students' identities. (Like, he would be there for them if they came out as gay.)

1biwpvb,"CMV: Progressives often sound like conservatives when it comes to ""incels""—characterizing the whole group by its extremists, insisting on a ""bootstrap mentality"" of self-improvement, framing issues in terms of ""entitlement,"" and generally refusing to consider larger systemic forces.","Married guy here. Happy relationship, sexually satisfied, father to a compassionate son, and I find fulfillment in my career.

I don't have a personal stake in the ""Incel Debates,"" but I do know a few loved ones who fit the term and I do spend way too much on the internet readings posts and articles discussing the topic.

Now, nothing in this post is intended to deny the reality that some incels are absolutely shitty people. I would say that I know four younger men who fall into this category and one of them (my youngest brother, actually) is someone I am deeply concerned for as he is now genuinely consumed with bitterness towards the world and women. However, the other three are genuinely great guys. They aren't 9s or 10s pulling down $200k while flexing their six-packs, but they're solid. **I'll put it this way:** I met my wife, dated, and got married in the late 2000s—before the rise of dating apps and the death of Third Spaces. ***If any of these three guys had been single during those years, they would have easily been able to strike up relationships.*** 

And yet I've seen these guys 1) get unfairly tagged with the ""incel"" label and its stigma and 2) listened to their sincere emotional pain over having very few outlets for discussing the loneliness and relational hardships they face. That's really what has prompted this post.

So as someone who grew up in a deeply conservative Southern community and left it for more progressive communities, why am I seeing so many ""conservative"" arguments made in attacking single men who feel like the deck is stacked against them?

**Someone CMV because what I'm seeing is:**

* ""Incels are dangerous misogynists and even terrorists."" This sounds like my conservative hometown talking about Muslims after 9/11. When is judging a whole group by its worst elements ever justified?
* ""Incels should focus on improving themselves instead of complaining all the time—then they'd get dates."" This sounds like my conservative town talking about poor people. Is ""picking yourself up by the bootstraps"" ever the solution to something that is affecting millions of people?
* ""Incels feel like they are *entitled* to sex. No one is entitled to *my* body!"" This sounds like my conservative hometown decades ago when it fought against the end of segregation or today when they cheer for the dismantling of affirmative action. ""No one is *entitled* to a position in my company, so I don't have to hire gay people"" or ""No is *entitled* to admission to Harvard, so they should be free to only admit Whites and Asians.""
* ""Incels just have a victim mentality. No one is oppressing them."" This sounds like my conservative hometown refusing to acknowledge that it things like marginalization and systemic injustice don't rely on mustache-twirling cartoon villains—they come about and perpetuate themselves through our inaction and refusal to consider how even our seemingly benign actions could be causing harm to someone else.",Sbis31,758,1.0,1847,1710885682,2024-03-19 17:01:22,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1biwpvb/cmv_progressives_often_sound_like_conservatives/,3,2024
1bjjd5t,"CMV: jobs requiring constant physical labour deserve to be paid a lot than they currently are. Especially when comparing to the pay of other jobs, that don’t require physical labour, like a desk job. ","I don’t understand how people breaking their backs everyday, putting their bodies through hell, can get paid minimum wage. The future impact this sort of work has on your body after decades of wear and tear is astonishing. 

The medical bills and terminal pain that physical labourers experience in their old age is NOT worth getting paid minimum in their youth. Minimum wage is not worth the cost of the medical bills they will be experiencing in the future.

I have the opinion that people working on the loading dock and busting their butts deserve to be compensated the same as someone like a banker, a lawyer, or even a neurosceintist. It’s not fair that physical labourers get paid insanely less, but then also have to deal with expensive medical bills in the future. I can see why Lenin or Karl Marx had the opinions they had, it’s because their way of thinking is a lot more fair for **EVERYONE** . I can imagine people being against a communist system if they were born into privledge, and don’t want to share their wealth.

I happen to work at a loading dock for Walmart and this job is nothing like I expected. When you receive a job offer from the #1 company on the Fortune 500 list, you expect the job to be at least decently cushy, and to compensate well. That’s not the case. My co-workers recently informed me that we make the absolute bare-minimum income that they can legally pay us in this province. It’s a living heck hole in that loading dock area and most of my co-workers are at the bottom of society, barely scraping together a living. Tell me how the CEO can make millions of dollars while we’re working harder than him?! How does that make sense. This isn’t happening just with Walmart too, this is many billion dollar companies around the world.

I want to abolish the far-right economic system we have right now, and I want to bring in more aspects of communism. That doesn’t mean I want to be full communist but I do want workers to be compensated like it is a communist society. There is no way that you can tell me a banker works harder than I do, when I’m sweating my balls off carrying 50-100 lb boxes, **MY ENTIRE 6 HOUR SHIFT** . Professional athletes get paid millions for training everyday and there’s an argument that me and my co-workers are arguably putting our bodies through much much worse, but get compensated so much less. 

Lebron James makes $45 million a year. He plays roughly 100 games in a season (including playoffs), and each game is 48 minutes. 100 x 48 = 4800 minutes. 45 million / 4800min = $9374/minute.

$9375 x 60 min = $562,500/hour

That’s how much Lebron gets paid. Now let’s calculate how much I get paid per hour compared to him, and why don’t you capitalistic, fantastical economic ‘geniuses’ explain how that’s fair. Spoiler alert, #ITS NOT . But I digress. 

$15/562,500 x 100 = 0.00266%

**Let me say that again for the neoconservatists in the back** . My salary is 0.00266% of Lebrons. And all he does is throw a rubber ball through a metal ring… it’s complete bush league.

I’d like someone to argue against the fact that physical labour jobs need a LOT more compensation, and that a communist economic system is a lot more fair than a ‘free market’ one. I’m not saying we should be getting paid the exact same as Lebron James or a neuroscientist but it shouldn’t be anywhere near what it is now, and it frankly shouldn’t be anything past double our salary. Because there is no argument for them working double as hard as me, when I’m working as hard as I possibly can every day. I work so hard that I have been taking adhd pills from my coworkers every shift just to get through it. 

P.S. it’s funny that they call it a ‘free market economic system’ when I’m literally a slave to the system, sacrificing my youth and body for chump change. Us physical labourers are anything but free.

1bjx989,CMV: my ancestors owned slaves and I don’t really care. ,"So I’m talking about US slavery here in case that needs to be said. I grew up always knowing this, but I was confused why my mom seemed particularly ashamed of the fact that one of her ancestors owned slaves. 

The matter came up in conversation recently and some peers were kind of astonished that this isn’t something I feel a need to “make right,” or feel really anything about whatsoever. My ancestors owning slaves is a statement of basic fact that I don’t feel any real connection to whatsoever.

The idea that I’d even consider this to have any connection to or influence over my life is frankly absurd to me. One of my friends was even saying how like his brother in law or something found and reached out to descendants of slaves his family owns, I can’t even bring myself to explain the violations of privacy and just general pointlessness I see in this action. 

I am going to make the following general statements, which I hold to be true, to help clarify some things. The first two shouldn’t need clarification but I don’t want to have to type them out later:

1. My ancestors committed a horrible crime.

2. Slavery is evil. 

3. Modern black people in America suffer from lingering effects of centuries of slavery. 

4. “Slaves” is plural in the post, we are talking about a lot of slaves. This was a southern aristocratic family whose name is on the constitution, several people have Wikipedia articles and were involved in state government. Big time slave owners. 

As for why I don’t care: I cannot point to any direct influence this has had on my life. As far as I am aware, my specific lineage was disinherited. I grew up in a rather typical middle class family. The slave owners’ nonexistent influence over my life obviously dwarfs the influence I ever had over their actions. 


If one could assign an exact dollar amount to which I have benefited then I’d be willing to have a more serious inquiry into whether I owe anything to anybody. Any “debt” I have is basically completely speculative, and I really emphatically doubt any action on my end would ever be viewed as a complete atonement anyway. 

Moreover, I really doubt that anyone’s lineage is really completely perfectly morally upstanding by modern standards if you start going back 5 generations anyway. Two wrongs don’t make a right, but the history of mankind is really a history of oppression and exploitation. I don’t view this as anything terribly different than what groups have done, or would have gladly done if given the chance, throughout all of human history.

1bk2irj,CMV: Netanyahu Never wanted Peace,"\>!DISCLAIMER: This post is only a conversation with the decent people left within our society who just want peace.!<

  
So the Prime minster of israel, and the rest of his extremist cabinet, just want the war to rage on, as long as they get their paychecks, and as long as the people they dislike are dying. Doesn't matter if it's at the cost of kids, elderly, pregnant women, hostages.. They just pretend to have a mission.  
So let's talk about the supposed mission of ""Eliminating Hamas""  
The israeli gov will claim they are only targeting Hamas..  
But, for years, Netanyahu was reported to be helping fund Hamas (as per [TimesOfIsrael](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) & [NyTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-money-prop-up-hamas.html)), and in 2019, He himself said and i [quote](https://twitter.com/haaretzcom/status/1711329340804186619?lang=en); ""Whoever wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support the strengthening and financing of Hamas.""  
On top of that, The current finance minister of israel, said in 2015 and i [quote](https://twitter.com/rulajebreal/status/1720923597873549554) ""Hamas at this point, in my opinion, is an asset.""  
So how can you eliminate your asset?  
Here's the government strategy;  
Keep Hamas in power. Offer anything except a sovereign Palestinian state ""for security reasons"", and disrupt any real effort for Peace ([Osslo accords](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine)). Ignore the illegal settlements ([condemned by the UN](https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15424.doc.htm)), and the killing of Palestinians in the israeli controlled West bank.  
Make life unbearable for Palestinians, Facilitate unemployment [conditions](https://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/20190606_forced_unemployment), cut the water sources ([documented](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/)), introduce bills to control the [courts](https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-supreme-court-overturns-a-key-component-of-netanyahu-s-polarizing-judicial-overhaul-/7420408.html), destroying the biggest buildings in Gaza to displace civilians, killing and arresting civilians who protest or show any contempt of past actions, Hamas attacks you, literally do whatever you want (Defending yourself).  
5 months after Oct the 7th, Gaza flattened, at least 30k civilians dead (most are women and children as reported by the pentagon), israel killed more hostages than released, Hamas still around.  
The goal was clear, even before Oct the 7th, they never wanted Peace, or a Palestinian state.  
2023 was reported to be the deadliest year in the history of the West bank. It got to the point where Biden himself had put a ban on individuals committing atrocities there, and that's not mentioning the uncontrolled army killings, because they see no consequences, they act as if the Palestinian lives do not matter.  
As cited in South Africa's [case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOW_1exsHE8), the army led by Netanyahu believe everyone in Gaza is complicit, as Netanyahu cited the biblical term ""Amalek"" at the beginning of the offensive on Gaza, he said ""Remember what the Amalek has done to you.""  
The biblical scripture regarding Amalekites reads ""I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'  
The IDF soldiers later filmed themselves shouting ""There are no innocent civilians"". They also have filmed themselves celebrating destruction, burning aid, looting homes, posing in women's underwear, mocking traumatized people, the list goes on..  
Currently, famine is looming on many in Gaza, as reports confirm israel have been blocking aid to the entire north, for three month, till two days ago, when they got pressured into letting 13 trucks in, which is way short of what is needed (500 trucks per day as estimated by UN).

  
Earlier this week, The US Senator Chris Van Hollen admits after crafting the national security memorandum, and after the reports, that israel is not in compliance with international law, they are blocking aid such as maternity kits, water purifiers, from entering the Gaza strip, sending back a lot of the of trucks, not to mention letting civilians block aid entrances..  
He also stated that, “There is no doubt that the claims that Netanyahu made that UNRWA is a tool of Hamas are ""flat-out lies,"","" The person who runs operations on the ground in Gaza is a 20 year U.S. Army veteran”, he added.

  
Earlier, The israeli gov claimed 12 UNRWA (Aid agency) members were affiliated with Hamas, without providing evidence, and the US cut aid to UNRWA, so did the EU, amidst famine. Now amidst investigations, there is no evidence of such affiliation, even UNRWA stated that personal were tortured to admit such links. The EU have restored funding, and the US is still pending..  
It has become evident that the Netanyahu's government, and those with extremist ideology (Zionism), never wanted peace in the middle east (as stated in the Likud party charter) they want all the land from Jordan to the sea, and they will abuse the power given to them without oversight  
As history shows, if we really want to achieve peace, we must deliver justice, prosecute criminals, and figure out democratic solutions, without malicious intent from fascist governments.

&#x200B;

And before you go,   
Here are my 3 main questions/concerns to be answered thoroughly for you to change my mind;

&#x200B;

1-  Why would the israeli army [bulldoze](https://twitter.com/i/status/1748013404663537974) trees in the middle of the roads, render all water treatment plants nonfunctional or [destroyed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/middleeast/gaza-water-plant-photos.html), blocking aid trucks from entering maternity kits & water purifiers?

  
2- According to all humanitarian fronts ([UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147656), [IRC](https://www.rescue.org/press-release/famine-imminent-northern-gaza-children-are-being-starved-israels-blockade-and), [ICP](https://www.care-international.org/news/ipc-report-half-gaza-experiencing-catastrophic-hunger-famine-imminent-northern-governorates) and more), 1 million civilians in Gaza right now are facing stage 5 of famine (the highest), why would the israeli gov still blockade the aid when they can control how it is distributed and got the armed forces to secure that?

&#x200B;

3- Some people are yelling ""release the hostages"" on posts of dying kids (as if these kids got them), do you think it's acceptable for the isreali gov to starve kids/innocent civilians to death if Hamas can sort themselves out and not surrender?",HourDrive1510,673,1.0,830,1711013344,2024-03-21 04:29:04,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bk2irj/cmv_netanyahu_never_wanted_peace/,3,2024
1bk7l5z,CMV: Apple stuff is overpriced and students have no real need for them,"I admit iPhones aren't a bad idea nowadays, but most everything else that Apple makes is overpriced to oblivion.

People keep recommending Macbooks to students, but honestly I feel like students are the last people who should buy a Mac. The cost of the 13 inch Macbook Air is already inflated at 1100 USD for a machine with 8 GB  RAM and a measle 256 GB of storage, and the second you start upgrading the specs Apple dials the bullshit up to 11. increasing system RAM by 8GB is 200 dollars and going from 256GB SSD to 1TB is a whopping 400 dollars. Outside of battery life, this thing would get destroyed by a thin and light Windows machine of around the same price like the Legion Slim 5 or Asus G14. Plus both of these 2 examples have far better displays and a discrete GPU.

The Apple watch is meh at best considering the poor battery life and ugly tiny spiderweb app drawer thing that's pure eye torture. But I guess the regular Apple watch 9 is a bit understandable. The Ultra is a huge dumpster fire though, it's advertised as an outdoors watch but it still has sad battery life at 36 hours which is a joke compared to established outdoors nav watches like the Fenix 7 pro series with up to 37 days of battery life. Worse yet it's supposed to be used by divers but it requires touch interactions for most things... For a watch that you're supposed to use underwater...

Apple's products aren't competitive at their respective prices at all, which makes it  extra strange that people recommend them to students.",Core2score,986,1.0,719,1711030669,2024-03-21 09:17:49,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bk7l5z/cmv_apple_stuff_is_overpriced_and_students_have/,3,2024
1bkcjwv,CMV: Russian propaganda machine holds a major role in the pro-Palestinian movement,"**To start with, this is not a debate praising or critisizing any faction belonging to Palestine, Israel, Russia or the West.** There is a lot of misinformation circulating on all sides and I'm trying to avoid sourcing any unfounded statements/articles.

 My argument is that it is in Russia's leadership's interest to desguise their attempts of destabilization of Western leadership by disguising their propaganda in criminalising Western support for Israel. 

Let's take the US as a first point of discussion. A good portion of the left wing leaning people who would likely vote for Biden are reconsidering their vote accusing him for complicity in what they call genocide commited by Israel against Palestinians, since the current US administration has been maintaing the strong military cooperation with Israeli Defence Forces. Despite the financial contributions the US along with its European partners pay to the Palestinian territories ([US gov fact sheet](https://www.state.gov/u-s-support-for-the-palestinian-people/) from 2022), this hardly gets mentioned in the media, be it mainstream or the independent sources that make it to the wider public. While the Biden administration loses credibility among the demographic that supports him and often seems to take action or at least make statements responding to this political pressure in a way to keep his electorate, Trump is out there telling the public that he is a man of peace and that all wars will end the day he takes the presidential office. It goes without saying that Trump holds the more NATO-skeptic view of the two presidential candidates, especially after statements such as only defending countries that meet a budgeting criteria and continous efforts to stop aid to Ukraine which plays in Russia's benefit. 

Same goes in the UK (where I live). I know a lot of people who are promoting boycotts on companies that are in any way related with either Israel or the United States and are criminalising the current conservative leadership for their support for Israel. Despite the internal power struggles, the British Conservative Party has maintained its role as one of Ukraine's closest partners since the 2022 full scale invasion of Ukraine, so once again the public losing trust in the leadership could potentially lead to a change in the UK's foreign policy that might affect Ukraine negatively and thus, Russia positevely.

As for Russia's position on the Israel-Hamas war, we have Sergey Lavrov (Russia's foreign minister) taking [a clear stance](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FEoobEVZfRY) way before Oct 7, we have a souring relationship between Israel and Russia, and we have a [peace convention](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/29/palestinian-unity-on-agenda-as-hamas-fatah-leaders-to-meet-in-moscow) between Palestinian factions held very recently in Moscow.

My last argument is a clear record of Russian propaganda diguising itself in various forms of activism. In my home country (Romania) there is a popular far right party called AUR (Alliace for Union of Romanians) whose claimed main objective is the unification of Romania and the Republic of Moldova to regain historical borders. However, their leader (George Simion) has interdiction to enter both the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine (both have territories under Russian military occupation) because authorities from both countries deemed him as an asset of Russian propaganda. Members of AUR have claimed that Romania should set as an objective to take the territories from Ukraine that host Romanian ethnics. Despite AUR's claimed ideology, their actions align more with Russia's interest and they even got themselves the nickname 'Alliance for Union with Russia'. Also, there have been multiple claims of Russian involvement with environmental activists and NGOs to shift public view in their favour, such as [influencing European public against internally sourced gas exploitaitions, in order to keep Europe dependent on Russian gas.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/19/russia-secretly-working-with-environmentalists-to-oppose-fracking) Therefore I believe Russia will hide behind any side of the political spectrum to manipulate the people in the West.  


This is not to say that people who express their support and concern for the Palestinian cause are ill intended, however I think at least some of the information on the they are receiving and forwarding is playing in Russia's interests and it makes sense for Russia to invest into this information/misinformation capital.   


As a sidenote, I have travelled to both Israel and West Bank zone A (full Palestinian Authority control) a couple of weeks ago. While the main focus of my visit was on historical/archeological sites, the subject of the current conflict was unavoidable. The views on the conflict that were shared with me by Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs and Palestinians do not reflect anything that I have read or heard in the West, no matter from what side of the dispute. It was as if here in the West we are talking about a different conflict and it made me even more skeptical about how I read into news regarding external affairs. However, my CMV is about what gets to the wider public rather than debating on the actual tensions, therefore I kept my views and experiences on the matter out of my arguments.",motoci,420,1.0,732,1711043129,2024-03-21 12:45:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bkcjwv/cmv_russian_propaganda_machine_holds_a_major_role/,3,2024

Why does the worker also not get a two week notice to find employment? I mean a business is not as hurt by someone leaving as a person is if they suddenly end up thrown out of a means of income.

The company size may make the situation more similar for both, but even then, equality in this would still be fair.

Is there something from the Company's perspective that I'm missing?

Sex was a right of the husband and, whether they planned it or not, pregnancy was a common side effect of that right. Hence the families with like, 14 kids. That meant at minimum the husband and wife had sex 14 times. Maybe the only sessions in their marriage and each session produced a child. But it was a given that the risk was always there.

Healthcare in America an expensive disaster?  Always the ""hard choice"" to privitize more, cut funding, ensure insurance companies keep making lot of money.

Any time you hear someone saying they are willing to make the ""hard choice"", you should \*immediately\* go shields up and pay very careful attention to what they are saying and (more importantly) what they are doing.

1bmthzg,CMV: Insecurity is a perfectly valid reason to not want to date someone with an exceedingly high body count.,"I see this mentioned a lot when it comes to debates of whether or not a guy wants to date a woman that's been with a lot of men and had a ton of hookups, and I don't really see how that somehow makes it invalid to not want to date a woman over it. In fact it's pretty self aware and logical.

Insecurity is not a bad thing and it's something that all people have. Sex is an incredibly intimate and vulnerable act and men have the added factor of sexual performance is something that men are mocked for pretty regularly. This included getting mocked in a vacuum or getting compared to men your partner has been with before and coming up short (no pun intended) so it's not really a suprise that lots of guys would choose to be in a relationship where this isn't as much of an issue. 

Another aspect is that the types of guys that are able to have casual sex with women are typically incredibly conventionally attractive guys. Lots of average guys don't want to feel like they're being settled for when it comes to how sexually attractive they are to their partner, so if a woman doesn't have a sexually history that implies that, there's less of a reason to feel insecure.

If you as a man are deciding to not date a woman for one of these reasons you're not doing anything bad. You're not viewing a woman as less than for her sexual history, you're not taking out your feelings on your partner, the only thing you are doing is looking for a relationship you are comfortable in. I guess worst case scenario, you could be hypocritical if you have a high body count, but the guys that have 10+ body counts are the super conventionally attractive guys who I doubt are insecure and using more misogynistic reasons to justify not wanting to date a promiscuous woman",Tall_Promotion_7160,429,1.0,968,1711309492,2024-03-24 14:44:52,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bmthzg/cmv_insecurity_is_a_perfectly_valid_reason_to_not/,3,2024
1bn9s9z,"CMV: Permabanning is useless, nonsensical and overly punitive (this is NOT a meta about this specific subreddit)","With a permaban, we are talking about a *lifetime ban* from a community. And most often, it isn't for heinous things. If someone was sexually harassing or threatening violence in a community, I can understand why the mods would want them permanently exiled. But often we're talking about getting banned for some minor rule infraction.  
So some teenager says some edgy or thoughtless comment in a community, or fails to read the rules properly. They're banned. Two decades later, they're a completely different person. Different political beliefs, different outlook on life, a whole ass career, a spouse and family maybe. Point is they probably no longer hold the same opinion that got them permabanned in the first place. And yet, 2 decades of character development and they are still banned. If they want to rejoin the community, they have to use another account, and if they do that, it's ""ban evasion"".  
I don't see what permabanning achieves that a 2 year or even a six month ban doesn't. Except aggressively punish people for minor infractions.  
Is it meant to exist as a threat, so that people behave themselves? Then why are so many people permabanned without so much as a warning?

1bnolej,CMV: Russia cannot win the war in Ukraine at this point.,"So by victory I mean achieving objectives, which we should consider at the start of the invasion, when the intention was to take Kyiv and install a puppet government, and to take much of Ukraine. 

But to expand on that, long term what could Russia's reduced goals be considered? A smaller area of Ukraine? Slowing the spread of NATO? ""de-nazification?""

I contend that in the long run none of these will happen in a way that Russia desires. To change my view on this you will need to convince me that Russia can achieve their military goals in Ukraine.

Don't come at me with Russia adjusting their goals and claiming victory, like ""well we didn't want Ukraine anyway, and our goal was to cause NATO to expand"", I am not buying that.

Here goes:

Russia on offense:

* Russian military doctrine is terrible at projecting power. Russia uses old soviet military doctrine, which is to defend the homeland on the cheap. More lower end tanks, more lower end artillery, more lower end aircraft, etc. Fewer support trucks per battalion, instead moving men, machine and supplies by rail inside Russia, And not going for air dominance but airspace denial. Using robust SAMs to deny airspace once the ground has taken.
* Russian logistics are worse than Russian military doctrine. This is the ability to provide reinforcements, ammunition, food, and other supplies to those fighting the war. Omar Bradley once said amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics, and he was correct. Keeping the war machine moving takes good logistics, and Russia is garbage at it.
* Russian maintenance practices are marred by corruption and inefficiency. Corruption has caused needed maintenance not to happen, or to be underfunded after theft of funding. And this has caused Russia to have more failures than expected in ordinance (at one point 60% of Russia's guided missiles failed to launch, target or detonate) or in equipment. (Russia has had a staggering failure rate on vehicles and aircraft. You have to do the wrench work, and Russia doesn't do it well.
* Russia's losses have been severe. Not just in human losses, having lost more soldiers to being killed or wounded, having lost perhaps 400,000 soldiers to being wounded or killed. (now more than the USA has lost in all wars going back to WW2, and now they are going into WW2 in terms of US losses) and Russia has endured. In terms of vehicles the losses are perhaps more damaging, as replacement is not as easy as another round of conscription, where we now see Russia sending T54/55 tanks into Ukraine, tanks built in 1948. Russian losses so far, per Oryx, who verifies losses via images or video:

2856 tanks  
  
1273 armored fighting vehicles  
  
3677 infantry fighting vehicles  
  
418 armored personnel carriers  
  
3175 trucks  
  
353 towed artillery   
  
706 self propelled artillery  
  
361 multiple rocket launchers  
  
106 aircraft  
  
135 helicopters  
  
21 naval ships and submarines

That is a large amount off loss for Russia, a country not able to replace their losses.

https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\_of\_the\_Russo-Ukrainian\_War

So militarily, Russia cannot project power well, and has gone about as far as they are going to go in terms of offensive actions. Russia will struggle to go any farther, and the harder they push the worse the losses will be. Will they run out of soldiers? No, but they will run out of equipment for those soldiers. As much as it was a shock to see two US sourced Bradley's kill a modern Russian T-90, a Russian T62 or T54/55 has no place on a modern battlefield, they will not last long in combat.

So that is the ability for Russia to go on offense, now let's talk Russia on defense:

* Russian defensive ability is better than their offensive ability, and it isn't close. Now their artillery and their mines have much more value, and the S400 and S500 systems are quite good, and they can deny the airspace near the front to non-stealthy Ukrainian aircraft.

If Ukraine attacks these defenses, Ukraine will take much larger losses than when defending against Russian offenses. They can and should keep fighting, but carefully, as to prevent as many losses as possible.

But in the long run, the Russian defensive ability wont save them. First, Russia hasn't achieved their goals, right now if it all ended Russia didn't achieve their goals and lost a staggering amount, right now it would be a loss if Russia didn't go back on offense...and if they did it would be a terrible idea for them.

Why wont Russian defensive capability save them? Let's talk some reality. First, if Ukraine can destroy the Kerch Strait bridge, they probably take Crimea through siege. Russia feeds and arms their forces in Crimea using that bridge, and without it their ability to continue that (bearing in mind poor Russian logistics) are compromised. Sending those supplies across the water cannot possible support their forces there and can also be targeted, and sending them through contested Ukraine is quite a lot farther and more costly, and is also in danger in the parts of Ukraine it would have to drive through.

That is Crimea eventually falling. It is a matter of when, not if.

Now the parts of Ukraine with a direct land connection to Russia? That is much more problematic. For Ukraine to take that would take military capability Ukraine, but in the end if those areas are returned to Ukraine (and again, keeping those areas is not a victory for Russia, I am speculating in what a full victory for Ukraine would look like) it will not be because they were lost militarily.

Why? Let's talk sanctions:

The sanctions are doing more than you might think. Russia is hurting. Russia is buying artillery shells from North Korea and drones from Iran, nations Russia used to supply, now they are a customer. That speaks to Russia's military industry. Russia cannot build Armada tanks to send into war, they are sending T54/55s built in 1948. And Russia cannot build more SU-57's, an aircraft not seen over Ukraine. 

Russia is mainly selling gas and oil to China and India, and they are selling it for currency that only buys goods and services from China and India. That will not help them to win the war. 

So as long as the sanctions continue, Russia's clock is ticking. They can put off the inevitable, but in the end Russia will have to abandon this war that they started. Economics demand it.

Will the sanctions end? No, not until the war ends, and not for a while after that. So the west will keep the sanctions up for as long as it takes, as that serves the interests of the west. 

Will the military aid end? No. It will slow, but we are still talking about spares, older weapons systems and ammunition which is not front of the line for NATO. This is an investment for the west into Russian defeat, and the harder Russia loses, the more secure the west is when this war is over. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, lets talk about the reality of the situation for Russia:

Russia is sending T54/55s into war, Ukraine is now sending Abrams, Leopards and Challengers. Russia cannot take steps forward, their ability to project power is a joke. Russia is getting hit at home by Ukraine, and now by terrorists. And now NATO has expanded, now closer to Russia than ever, now covering both sides of the exit from St. Petersburg, making getting submarines out in a stealthy way more difficult for Russia. And in the end Ukraine has kept fighting, and the west has kept supporting them.

Russia has succeeded to the greatest extent that they are able to militarily and economically, and can go no further, and cannot be said to have won this war.   


And the future is more bleak for Russia than the present.

&#x200B;

So please, change my view on this if you can. Convince me that it is possible for Russia to achieve their military objectives in Ukraine.",TheMikeyMac13,487,1.0,683,1711399767,2024-03-25 15:49:27,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bnolej/cmv_russia_cannot_win_the_war_in_ukraine_at_this/,3,2024

This starts with the claim that being homosexual is fin, but acts of homosexuality are a sin. This is homophobia presented to be less offensive. The view still wants homosexual people to whole up and hide themselves from society. It wants them to be romantically unhappy for their entire life. Anybody that holds this view is trash in my view.

For misogyny, a good example is authority. People will say women aren't lesser, they are just different and get different roles. And then completely ignore that those roles blatantly favour the man, give him all the power and authority and then pretend this isn't sexist.

1bp73vl,CMV: Online dating is dead.,"I feel like I tried all sorts of apps for about two years - Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, OKCupid, CoffeeMeetsBagel, and even FaceBook Dating. But the results were consistent regardless of the platform, where likes/matches were so rare, I never even got to plan a date. Furthermore, I've grown more and more doubtful that it's just me. I've been hearing many anecdotes, for what those are worth, that suggest that online dating in general has been downhill.

Plus, most apps have been bought out by MatchGroup, a publicly-traded company that's lost over 75% in stock price value since the vaccines rolled out in 2021. Indeed, when a company is ostensibly offering a service that's suppose to help people connect even in a basic way, but then rolls out a fourth paid subscription tier for Tinder that costs $500 per month, then I'm not sorry for thinking that they may not have my social/romantic interests in mind.

So, I've personally written off the whole concept, even though I do have at least three relatives that've met their partner via an app, albeit years ago. But this year, I'm ready to try other ways of meeting people, like volunteering, checking out events held at art galleries, film festivals, and more.

Now, if you can convince me that online dating is still alive in some way - or at least somehow hasn't gotten worse over the last three years - then I'd be genuinely impressed. I also don't want to hear any gaslighting that claims that I'm overrating my attractiveness; even if I was in denial, is attractiveness not subjective, at least to some degree? Now, I'm not gonna claim I'm as attractive as a Hollywood actor, but I feel a solid bit above average, too, and I've got a close female friend that's called me charming, respectful, and brilliant. Meanwhile, in online dating, I find it very hard to convey those attributes, at least in the very initial stages - but I digress.

I'm also not incapable of blaming myself and taking on personal responsibility. But I think we need to admit that sometimes, when you don't get the results you're hoping for, it's not always your fault.",Bifocals_of_Argus,355,1.0,507,1711559282,2024-03-27 12:08:02,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bp73vl/cmv_online_dating_is_dead/,3,2024

An argument for casual sex being superficial is that it doesn’t last long. But I don’t think that only long-term connections are valuable. We wouldn’t say that of a friendship or romantic relationship after it ends. 

The other argument may be that it has to be superficial because if it’s not, then you catch feelings and want more. But we don’t say that of say friendships, although it also may and does happen. But we don’t tell people not to connect too much with their friends lest they catch feelings.

My problem is not with sex work in and of itself, however, when this hustle is played off as something that's supposed to be liberating or empowering in any way shape or form is where I have to roll my eyes and draw the line.

I'm sorry, but there is nothing ""empowering"" about competitively capitalizing on how effectively your physical appearance can be fetishized and marketed in accordance with stringent hierarchical beauty standards.

Is it not ""cruel and unusual"" to force a dying animal to stay alive just because you dictate it should, and because it would make you personally more happy? It is. So, why is it different for people?

That and there is no government mandated 100% safe and certain way to end your life. You're forced to take matters into your own hands with a large margin of error.

1bu11sl,CMV: I believe society let female harasser and predators get away with things lightly just because people find it hard attributing such behavior to women,"
I work as a male stripper , and I encounter a lot of evil, manipulative and predatory women in my line of work. They are more common in the rich and “high profile” parties/clients . 

And I find it odd how no one talks about it. And how it’s low key rewarded by society.


When I first started modeling and dancing, I was good at my job where I ended up being invited to more high profile parties to just perform. I was in my early 20s. Perform to rich , famous people sometimes even.

And my first encounter with sexual harassment was in one of these parties by one of these rich/popular women.

I froze and let it happen. 

But then when I told my manager and colleagues , I was always told to “man up” or “you should feel lucky” or “many guys would pay to be in that position” and so on.

I guess it didn’t help that these clients held a lot of power in terms of money and influence that the managers would side with them and just train us to let it happen and enjoy and shut up about it . 

Being a nobody who was young , being paid good and peer pressured into it being a good thing . You get used to it. 

Because to society , when a woman is the predator , it’s seen as hot.

And it’s not even about me being a man , it happens to female dancers as well , and the response is very different when its a woman taking advantage of her power compared to men. 


I just find it odd . Maybe I’m wrong but I just felt like sharing my point of view

1bvtplk,CMV: Anyone who sacrifices 40 hours a week of their life deserves to make a living wage,"I will define a living wage as enough money to cover food, housing, internet, phone, electricity, and necessary travel to and from work. Pretty basic, and far from lavish. 

40 hours a week is 24% of one's life. That amount of time should be valued enough by society to grant someone dignity and the ability to cover their basic needs. 

Looking at minimum wage jobs, a worker at McDonald's works harder than many high earning professions, doing a job not many others are willing to do, to provide a service that society would miss if no one was willing to work it. Even low skill jobs, apply stress, exhaustion, and sacrifice of time out of their lives. 

I would also argue that many minimum wage jobs are more important to daily functions of the public, than a lot of cushiony mid to higher level experience jobs, otherwise these jobs wouldn't exist.

People often use the example that a teenager in school doesn't need to make a living wage, however if they are working full time, perhaps they do. Regardless, their effort and the time committed to working said job should warrant the same pay, if they put in the same hours.

1bx9zvu,CMV: western young men are becoming more conservative in terms of their views on sexuality,"One thing parallel between my muslim home country and western world is the unpopularity of feminism among men. Indeed, I observed in every country around the world, men are far more likely to hate feminism than women. 

But there is another thing that is increasingly becoming popular among young male western audience, that is emphasis on low body count which seems to be some kind of revival of purity culture. It’s more pronounced online. A lot of posts here on the topic of body count attract hoards of men trying to assert not just how it matters, but how it matters more for women than men. It’s not only on reddit. Take instagram, X, facebook and tiktok as well. 


I’m left rather confused regarding what these men precisely mean by low body count. Back in my home country, the consensus is that a woman should be virgin before marriage. With western male audience, I do find a lot of men saying they want or prefer virgins, but the majority seems to be drawing arbitrary lines. The benchmark is sometimes 3, and other times 5. Some move it even further as well. 


I’m skeptic of claims such as men ideally prefer virgins, since past research has shown decreasing value of chastity among men in the western world.

1bxh1yb,CMV: The average person in the United States should not trust the police.,"I’m coming from this from an American perspective but this may or may not be true in other countries. I suspect it is similar in many countries.

The view is simple. The police have a specific job and that job has nothing to do with serving the average person. Police work for the government and enforce the government’s laws and prioritize what the government wants them to prioritize. This mostly ends up meaning they protect rich people’s property and persons from poor people because the government primarily serves the interests of rich people.

The average person simply is not a priority for the government/police until they break a law. It has been ruled by the Supreme Court that the police have no obligation to protect you and it is standard procedure for police to lie to you if they think it’ll get them what they want.

To get ahead of the straw man arguments, no I am not saying the average person doesn’t benefit from the police in any way. I’m not saying the police are necessarily out to get you. I’m not saying your cop brother is an untrustworthy person. I’m specifically saying that the average person should not trust the police as an institution because the police are not necessarily on the average person’s side.",Grandemestizo,414,0.7300000190734863,423,1712424428,2024-04-06 12:27:08,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bxh1yb/cmv_the_average_person_in_the_united_states/,4,2024
1bxoafx,CMV: Labeling sexual/romantic orientations has gotten out of control and is now leading to more problems than solutions,"Hear me out bc ik This is a super hot topic but I asked a mod and its alright as long as this is not about gender identity which I understand and it is not

Please note:

I labeled it 18+ as im sure triggering stuff will be mentioned

Also i swear i don‘t mean to be offensive, I am sure that my argument is missing others povs hence this sub so keep that in mind

And I am specifically talking about romantic/sexual orientation, not gender identity. That is something way different and should not be discussed here at all.

So:

I will always stand for peoples right to exist in peace, surrounded by love and care regardless of your sexual/romantic orientation. I myself am in the pride community.

But I am genuinely so annoyed of reading on forums and subs, ‚i like this person, does that mean I am x orientation?‘

I understand that giving yourself a label is important because it helps you understand yourself. And I understand that back then when not much was known in the mainstream world, labels helped with identification and explanations

But I also see it as just being very limiting and honestly just leads to more confusions than solutions

For instance me:

 I am (i think) asexual and aromantic, I have never once been properly attracted to anyone and honestly find sexual/romantic intimacy to be a no-go. But then there are few moments where I do get to know someone and I do envision a life with them, and so now im here like…wtf am I

And so I googled all the possible labels for my feelings and found out sapiosexual is a thing, and demisexual and so on. That too me is soo damn confusing now… because why do I need a Label that says ‚attraction for me starts when i gained an emotional attraction and such‘. I actually had people argue with me and say ‚if im ace then I can‘t feel sexual attraction period‘ and then others say ‚well no bc xyz exceptions exist‘ so which oen is it? We don‘t know, these labels habe created this divide now

Now im sure the first counter argument is going to be, you don‘t need one but let others have one if they want to

But i say: how do we know if they want one? Maybe they are surrounded so much by labels that they think they need one. Maybe a world can exist where you are who you are and love whoever you want (plz dont bring up nonsense like peddos i ofc don‘t mean them) and thats that.

Like i feel like it is these labels that brings up so much conflict, because labels then come with stereotypes and being boxed in.

And as I mentioned before in my case, I see the pride community struggle with this actually bc we now not only have gay or lesbian and such but we now have graysexual, semisexual etc. because we came to the realization that humans are all on a spectrum, and instead of leaving it at that we feel the need to label everything

I guess for my point to stick, we would have to agree on us being on a fluid spectrum which I understand not everyone agrees on. But if we (those who support it) know there are people who like x person of one group but also sometimes y person of another group, then why do insist on creating new labels rather than just saying ‚ ok this person likes this one but also this person‘ and thats that.

I hope my point is clear, feel free to ask for clarifications.

X instead asked Y about her thoughts on abortion. Y rejected that topic and said it was private. X pressed the issue, but Y refused to participate, saying she was uncomfortable to reveal her stance

X became upset, saying that a refusal to reveal her stance on such a polarizing topic was itself a political statement, and to be neutral is to stand with the oppressors (I am paraphrasing)

Y became noticeably angry and left the table

1byxjde,CMV: Israel is showing extreme callousness towards civilian casualties in their war in Gaza,"5 days ago, [+972 Mag](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/) published an article that focuses on Lavendar AI technology and the IDF approach to civilian casualties. A few other outlets have already reported on this story, so it is likely that the sources have been corroborated and +972 Mag is generally seen as [reliable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/972-magazine/). While most of the focus of the +972 Mag's article is on the AI, there are a few other things that really caught my attention:

>it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians; in the past, the military did not authorize any “collateral damage” during assassinations of low-ranking militants. 

This ratio of 15 to 20 civilians is _absurdly_ high for a low-ranking militant. According to [this article](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/assessing-israel-s-approach-to-proportionality-in-the-conduct-of-hostilities-in-gaza) on proportionality analysis, the US Army generally accepts _ZERO_ for low-ranking militant, anything in the realm of 14 to 15 requires approval from the Secretary of Defense, and for Osama bin Laden the figure is 30. I don't understand how the IDF is permitting its commanders to approve a strike themselves if it kills up to 20 civilians per low-ranking militant.

>they would personally devote only about “20 seconds” to each target before authorizing a bombing — just to make sure the Lavender-marked target is male. This was despite knowing that the system makes what are regarded as “errors” in approximately 10 percent of cases, and is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose connection to militant groups, or no connection at all.

I'm not sure about you, but 10% is a crazy high error rate, because this is additive to the error rate that humans make. This is not some sort of error rate for a sorting machine, this is an error rate of killing people with weaponry. Using this and the information provided above, there's _at least_ a 10% chance that up to 20 civilians will die because of a Lavender error. 

>the commander laments: “We [humans] cannot process so much information. It doesn’t matter how many people you have tasked to produce targets during the war — you still cannot produce enough targets per day.”

This is incredibly dystopian. It feels like the commanders have a target number to hit every day, and because humans aren't capable to hitting that target by ourselves, an AI tool is used to speed up that process, a tool that has very little oversight.

>the Lavender machine sometimes mistakenly flagged individuals who had communication patterns similar to known Hamas or PIJ operatives — including police and civil defense workers, militants’ relatives, residents who happened to have a name and nickname identical to that of an operative, and Gazans who used a device that once belonged to a Hamas operative. 

This is not just a problem that runs deep in Lavender, it runs deep in their training set as well, which means the IDF consistently flag non-Hamas civilians as Hamas members. It puts the number of ""Hamas militant killed"" into question because that figure reported by the IDF must've included a lot of false positives like militants' relatives, nurses, etc.

>We were constantly being pressured: ‘Bring us more targets.’ They really shouted at us. We finished [killing] our targets very quickly.”

This speaks to a more top-down approach and systemic problem to killing Hamas militants. Because of the pressure from higher ups to rake up Hamas death toll, the lower level officials feel pressured to kill without proper oversight or check on intelligence. It feels like someone clocking into work, being demanded to hit some x targets a day, and clock out. There seems to be little consideration for what is the actual threat the targets pose to Israel or IDF. 

>“In the bombing of the commander of the Shuja’iya Battalion, we knew that we would kill over 100 civilians,” 

It's insane to me that a target like Osama bin Laden has an acceptable civilian death ratio of 30, but a commander in Gaza has a ratio of 100. I don't know, this seems very callous to me.


I can go on and on and I can bring up other incidents too like the WCK drone strike, but the point I'm making here is even if the IDF doesn't have a policy to target civilians, they sure as hell ignore civilian casualties in their policy-making. I don't know how this does not amount to a systemic enabling of war crimes. Also, the IDF response (which we have no reason to believe is true) does not deny the claims made by the sources I quoted. They denied some of the interpretations/extrapolations by others, and some of the minor details, but not the central claim of the article or the quotes I put above.",WheatBerryPie,394,0.6600000262260437,856,1712581987,2024-04-08 08:13:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1byxjde/cmv_israel_is_showing_extreme_callousness_towards/,4,2024
1byyvoa,CMV: The abortion debate should not be framed as men vs. women,"I’m not here to argue about whether or not abortion should be legal. However for reference I am pro-choice and a man.

I fully acknowledge that women are more affected by abortion restrictions than men. That being said, as a man I’m don’t benefit from stronger abortion laws at ALL. If I unintentionally get a girl pregnant that I’m not in a relationship with, I have to pay child support for the next 18 years. Yes it’s much harder on the woman since she has to carry the child and breast feed, but my life would get worse as well. 

Polls in the United States would also show that women aren’t that much more likely to be pro choice either. 55% of women identify as pro choice vs. 48% of men. 

Really the debate should be framed as religious vs. non-religious since religious people feel that abortion is evil and killing an innocent life, while non-religious people don’t see it as a life and don’ think the government should interfere what someone does with their body.

At various points in history Muslim men have married Christian, Jewish, Confucian and even Hindu women. And were never seen as “less” Muslim for having done it. 

Not so for Muslim women. 

Miss me with the “the religion is inherited from the mother” boloney, there’s no quantifiable, genetic “muslimness” that’s passed down from mother to child. Men and women give the same amount of chromosomes to their kids and the same amount of religion too, which is none. 

There’s no reason a Muslim woman and a Christian man, who worked it out with each other prior to marriage, acknowledged that the children they’d have will be taught the values and tenets of Islam. That way the faith is preserved in the family if that’s so important to her.

1c05z7f,CMV: Religious fundamentalism leads to bad people,"Recently, I’ve been doing a bit of research into altruism and religion.

Correcting for errors in data collection showed that actually, children from more rigorous religious households are more likely to be mean to non-members than children from less rigorous religious households. So, right out the gate, fundamentalist children are bigger jerks to non-members. I’m sure this comes as no surprise to anyone on here. We all know the feeling of being looked down on by a religious fundamentalist; they often believe that all non-members are totally doomed, as well as foundationally evil.

I can extend this argument a bit further too. As far as I am concerned, killing any animal is as bad as another. There are certain obvious exceptions: 

1. Humans don't count in this list of ""animals"". I may not be able to currently make a completely coherent argument for why this distinction is so obviously justifiable (to me), but perhaps that is irrelevant for this CMV.

1c40sa9,"CMV: I struggle to understand why the crisis of masculinity is even a thing, why so many young men listen to the manosphere or influencers in general, etc. I think it is a case of crisis of independence rather than crisis of masculinity.","The current conversation about masculinity (in the US) confuses me very much, and I say this as a man. I grew up in a fairly stable middle class household, parents divorced in my early teens. I joined the US military at 18, served for a few years, and travelled around the country. After my service I started college and am soon entering my senior year. Why am I telling you all this?

I've always considered myself a highly independent person. I've also figured out a lot of things in my life on my own, to include how to rent an apartment, saving for retirement and amassing decent wealth for my age, entering and being successful in school, having a fair number of romantic partners. By many metrics of modern masculinity, I've done well for myself. But this also leaves me confused as to what men are missing from their lives or what they're having a crisis over.

I've never felt the need to have someone validate my masculinity (as it seems that needing someone else for that kinda defeats the point). Truth be told, ""being masculine"" has never really mattered to me much because its always seemed to be buying in to what someone else thinks is a necessary way to live your life--which returns me to my independence point. The rise of influencers and the manosphere has also seemed to be a weird proxy for mentors in many men's lives, which has always seemed to be a case of being far too online for too long in my opinion. I've also never really leaned on many mentors in my life, but that is probably by own bias showing, I'm sure many people get a lot of guidance out of mentor figures.

This altogether is to say that it seems that this crisis of masculinity is at its core a crisis of independence and men unable or unwilling to figure out their lives for themselves. Perhaps it was the military that ultimately gave me this independent foundation, but I think that proves my point--that it is independence and what it gives you than anything that masculinity is doing for people. The point is not that masculinity is failing or unstable, but that men are unable to be independent and take charge of their independence for themselves. Why, I'm not sure exactly--rent is high and wages are low, but women seemingly aren't having as much of a crisis about themselves these days.

And I think it's because social media and the internet have given us access to unbelievable amounts of information that simply didn't exist before. Not just information such as research papers and what not which have existed for a long time, but with tiktok we literally have millions of people giving their life experiences and how it's made them feel every day. We are getting to see how individual people perceive life and society at rates that we never have before.

Society essentially cannot handle this. Historically, different people and cultures have been taught and brought up on different narratives. Today, the narratives are being challenged through this mass sharing of experience and information. It's as if the essence of society is imploding on itself.

1c4wp1m,CMV: Dating apps massively contributed to the rise of manosphere/incel ideology,"I've been reading a lot of posts from those subscribed to manosphere stuff here, and I've come to realise that a huge part of why this is happening is the use of dating apps to get dates. The apps basically force everyone to judge a person by a few pictures and a short prompt and give the impression that how you look is all that matters in a relationship, when often people fall in love after knowing and talking to someone. Given that men outnumber women on these apps, it's not surprising that men would find themselves in a highly competitive environment when in reality it's much closer to 50/50. This imbalance left a lot of younger men disappointed at themselves and, worse yet, women for not getting dates. I have this sense that dating apps market themselves as a way to find love, but for a lot of men it's just something that they find upsetting and disappointing. And when someone doesn't have the right support and structure, they would find the manosphere ideology appealing because it feels like their failures have been answered, even though obviously the ideology falls apart at the smallest scrutiny.

I'm sure some people will attribute this to patriarchy, but this manner of demeaning women hasn't been mainstreamed for many many decades, and patriarchy certainly wasn't any weaker back then, so in my view the best explanation is the perception that dating apps is the only way to get dates.",WheatBerryPie,1646,0.8899999856948853,498,1713213042,2024-04-15 15:30:42,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c4wp1m/cmv_dating_apps_massively_contributed_to_the_rise/,4,2024
1c5lpos,"CMV: Saying ""I hate all men"" doesn't make sense","Firstly, to be clear, I understand that I may be in the wrong for this one.

A couple months ago I was hanging out with a bunch of friends (mostly women, two men, not including me) and one suddenly started talking about how she ""hated all men"" and went on about how much she hated all men and how all men should be killed.

While I understand that there are a lot of bad or evil men, and a lot of/all the men she had interacted with might be part of that group, but that can't mean everyone is.

I then said, confused, ""isn't that too much of a generalization?"" and ""there's gotta be, you know, an adjective before 'men' right?""

She didn't answer then, but one of the other girls sent me a message after, saying that the girl was furious about what I said.

Another thing is when I said, at a later time, that ""for example, what if I were to say: Women are bad drivers and get into car crashes all the time, therefore I hate all women"" (not that I believe that, of course)

She then replied ""It's not the same thing"" which also confuses me.

For short: I think it's ok to hate a group of (in this case) men, but grouping everyone with the people that rob, attack or rape people and therefore saying that you hate them doesn't make sense to me.

1c5mgu1,CMV: Everyone would be better off if women were the ones who were expected to make the first move.,"Attention from the opposite gender is like water. Men are desperately thirsty for it, while women are drowning in it.   
Most women don't like being approached randomly in public or being confessed to, while I don't know a single man who wouldn't appreciate being approached. The ""men remember compliments for years"" things is true for a reason. 

On top of that, there is also the aspect of safety, and the current societal expectation of men approaching women has resulted in women being seriously hurt or even killed due to rejecting a man. Women basically have to fear for their safety every time a man approaches them. Again, if women were the ones to approach, this wouldn't be an issue. 

If women were expected to approach, they could go out and not worry about guys hitting on her, and men can finally take a break from always having to be the initiator. Everyone wins.

Haircut prices are way too inflated these days at least in my area. Most of these barbers make these “transformation” videos on social media, where they intentionally make the ‘before’ look like shit and do a basic haircut at best, using fake enhancement like black pens to fill in hairline and beard patches. The video gets viral and they become ig famous because of young teenagers, which is the main audience of these barbers. And these barbers start charging (scamming) 80-100+ dollars for a haircut. They usually get these cuts done under 45 mins as well. As a result, the ego of these barbers is massively inflated too. This ego boost has somehow spread to the average barber and they have started charging 50+ dollars for average cuts at best. So a reasonable adult has no choice but to at least spend 50+ dollars on a simple haircut. Other option is cutting your own hair which is not very viable for many.

1c6swqd,CMV: The Tipping Culture In The US Has Gotten Ridiculous ,"I am going to get a lot of hate for this one but I’m already prepared lol. 

Tipping Culture in the US specifically has gotten way out of hand I mean it’s ridiculous at this point. I am not some stingy individual and I have no problem with giving people tips for their service and time. But nowadays there seems to be a weird vibe that you have to always tip, and if you don’t you are a scumbag or something. 

I grew up learning and understanding the value of tipping for GOOD service, not shitty service. If I go to a car wash and after my car still has visible stains and missed spots, I should not be forced to provide a tip for that service. 

And I know what you are thinking right now no one is forcing me to give anyone a tip. The issue is looks of shame and disgust that people in the service industry will give you, as well as the overall peer pressure of how others perceie you. 

And let’s not get started about when you give someone a tip and they feel like it is too small of an amount. A recent example is I gave my DoorDash driver a $10 tip for a $15 order, and he told me that it was disrespectful because it was not enough to cover his gas for driving to me. 

It’s little instances like this that make me feel the service industry in America have literally lost their minds when it comes to this whole tipping thing. 

Again I am not a stingy person, I just do not believe that I always have to leave a tip, especially when it comes to bad service.

1c7fp7w,CMV: Many of the Gulf States that are allied with the United States are as morally reprehensible as Iran,"American and British politicians love to paint Iran as a great evil of the Middle East, as if it's the only bad actor in town, but I think that a lot of the Gulf States like Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar are just as evil as Iran is. Just like Iran, these countries are authoritarian regimes that heavily restrict the freedom of their people. 

Saudi Arabia is a theocratic monarchy, and it's dominant from of Islamic interpretation, Wahhabism, is notably conservative amongst all Islamic interpretations. Women are only allowed to drive in 2017, and today women are still under the male guardianship system despite improvements over the years. In the Yemen Civil War, Saudi Arabia has been criticised for indiscriminate bombings and intentionally worsening the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. When it comes to suppressing dissent, they famously assassinated Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul because he was a known dissident of Saudi Arabia.

Qatar is also a monarchy and it's known for abusing it's foreign workforce and can be constitute modern slavery. The relationship between them and their employers opens them to be victims of human trafficking and forced labour. If we want to criticise the Iran-backed Houthis for modern slavery, let's not forget our goverments-backed Qatar for the same crime. 

You may then point out that at least they don't fund proxies. Well, they do! Saudi funds their proxies in Yemen, previously in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain and Lebanon to contain Iranian influence in the region. Today the UAE is the biggest supporter of RSF, a genocidal militant force in Sudan that is responsible for numerous massacres. 

The point here is American and British governments only call Iran a ""destabilising force"" or an adversary because of their refusal to align with the West, not because of their immoral or evil actions in the Middle East, because if that's the case we won't be aligning ourselves with most of the Gulf States.",WheatBerryPie,438,0.7699999809265137,385,1713476967,2024-04-18 16:49:27,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7fp7w/cmv_many_of_the_gulf_states_that_are_allied_with/,4,2024
1c7ibn3,CMV: Housing should not be an investment ,"I don’t believe that it’s good that housing is viewed as an investment. The problems I see from this are that: 

1 - this makes housing artificially more expensive than it should be and leads to homelessness and people spending too much money on rent/mortgage.

2 - housing as investment provides an incentive for home owners to be nimby’s. A class of people is created that now oppose the construction of new housing because this makes their homes less valuable.

3 - it’s a poor place to store wealth. Having wealth tied up in housing isn’t economically productive. Would it be better for the economy if your house cost $50k or 500k? If it was only 50k, you could diversify your wealth. You could buy bonds to help fund companies or the government. You could buy stocks. You could just spend it and put it right into the economy. 

I’m not saying that all housing should cost the same. A 4,000 sq foot apartment in NYC is always going to cost way more than a 700 sq foot apartment in Oklahoma City. But I don’t believe the price of housing (rents or home prices) should be expected to rise faster than inflation. 

How would it be achievable? Simple - build more housing. Tons of it. And most of it should be non-profit housing. This is housing - ideally apartment buildings - that is deed restricted to not increase rent above costs of the building. 

This would be a huge net benefit for society. ",eriksen2398,268,0.7400000095367432,501,1713483672,2024-04-18 18:41:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7ibn3/cmv_housing_should_not_be_an_investment/,4,2024

1c8rxy4,CMV: Polyamory is just a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal.,"Three years ago, my ex partner unilaterally demanded we open our marriage during a trip with friends where I couldn't escape or even have a healthy conversation about it, then threatened to leave if I didn't comply when we came home.   
  
I begged and pleaded, but eventually relented. Then, after a few months I began to explore the literature and rules of polyamory in online support groups and became curious about finding my own relationships outside of our marriage (I realised later that this was mostly to escape the abuse I was still putting up with at home, which had persisted for for years).   
  
When I told my partner that I was also curious to find other people, she exploded in a terrifying rage that I am still struggling to understand. She accused me of just taking advantage of her 'coming out polyamorous first' in our marriage, insisted that I couldn't possibly be polyamorous because I am autistic, and finally demanded I 'prove' to her (somehow) that I ever felt love for another person other than her. 

When I couldn't come up with an example other than the one other crush I had before we began officially dating six years prior, she again threatened to leave, screaming at me for being a misogynist, and all I could do was beg for forgiveness and cry myself to sleep. 

She apologised days later, but halfheartedly and still accused me of being both a misogynist and narcissist who needed therapy and we scheduled couple's therapy together with a poly-friendly therapist. 

Two months later--and four days before our appointment--she cheated on me. 

She came home and confessed while begging for forgiveness in another whirlwind of pain, and again I gave her a pass as I was now terrified of being abandoned--only for her to buy a one-way ticket to Portland the next morning. 

I never saw her again. 

She filed for divorce 1,000 miles away, leaving me with our two cats and a whole heap of debt. I still went to our therapist appointment somehow, but alone. She was incredible. She helped me understand the full extent of the abuse I had been suffering for years and convinced me that polyamory and narcissism often intersect--but don't necessarily have to. 

But it still didn't help, and I checked myself into an emergency outpatient facility after a suicide attempt.

Things stabilised, but I left the country and am now struggling with severe mental illness and barely making ends meet while having to deal with the constant aching pain of having lost my best friend to what still feels like a relationship system defined by 'what you can get out of life'--not on forming a unique, stable, honest, and committed partnership. 

Please help me change my view.

I'm left grappling with deep emotional scars, questioning whether polyamory is inherently flawed or if my experience was an outlier.

I acknowledge that my ex-partner's behaviour was manipulative and abusive, but I'm struggling to reconcile how polyamory could be anything other than a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal. However, I'm open to reconsidering my perspective, as I don't want to let one traumatic experience colour my understanding of an entire relationship dynamic.

I'm seeking insights from the community to challenge my current view. Can anyone provide examples or arguments that showcase healthy and fulfilling polyamorous relationships? How can I separate my ex-partner's toxic behaviour from the broader concept of polyamory? I want to believe that love and honesty can coexist within non-monogamous relationships, but I need help reconciling my pain and trauma.",Ronald-Obvious,1002,0.7900000214576721,357,1713625010,2024-04-20 09:56:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8rxy4/cmv_polyamory_is_just_a_breeding_ground_for/,4,2024
1c8si60,"CMV: The reason there’s so much loneliness in America today is because we’ve replaced the traditional institutions of community in America with social media and the internet, which are half-measures at best and actively harmful at worst.","Humans are, in my opinion, naturally lazy creatures who will always choose the path of least resistance in almost anything. This includes communication. Throughout most of human history our sense of community was connected to our ability to travel to meet other people or other peoples ability to travel to us. 

The postal service, mail, letters, tv radio shows and phones all altered the equation but none more fundamentally then the internet did. The internet offered something unique. The *closest* simulation you could get to having a person/people in the room with you while also being alone. It has the trappings of community but none of the soul. 

In addition to that, and this isn’t me blaming women it’s just observation, feminism. The increased freedom of movement allowed for women, the loosening of divorce laws and attitudes toward it, the slow, uneven elaxing of standards and expectations for women in general hurt it. 

Men in American aren’t socialized to be vulnerable and needy except when it comes to women. Women are far more comfortable openly expressing a want to be wanted by other women. Men, while still feeling the same things, just don’t do that for other men. Not openly at least. Because of fear of judgment etc. all this to say, women are socialized to be more…well, social. 

As wives and gfs and mothers they’re often responsible for organizing birthday parties, family reunions and holiday events. They’re the ones keeping in contact. Men are socialized and allowed to be more self centered in how they interact with women but especially other men. We just don’t care to ask each other deeper questions about our lives and society enables this in part by women taking up that extra burden and encouraging or scheduling actual events for us to take part in. 

And as birth rates have gone down, social institutions have declined, and women have more choice and higher standards for their partners, on a macroscopic level we’re seeing community tires fray and drift more. And what’s replaced them is so low effort and low investment that the very reasons we’re attracted to them are the reasons they fail to feed that spiritual and communal void within us that *needs* real, in-person interaction",makeyouamommy177,239,0.8399999737739563,180,1713626451,2024-04-20 10:20:51,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8si60/cmv_the_reason_theres_so_much_loneliness_in/,4,2024

1cadgf3,CMV: There has never been a good representation of Arab people in American media ,"I am Lebanese-Canadian and I struggled so much as a kid never seeing my Arab culture represented correctly or even just seeing Arab people always play the villains or terrorists in movies and tv shows. Still to this day I think any Arab character I’ve ever seen in popular media has been incredibly inaccurate or racist.  I think people veiw the Arab countries as too much of a controversial subject to put into media as a main character hero or protagonist. Anytime Americans see depictions of Arab culture their brain Immidiatly associates it with war, terrorism, and Islamophobia. No positive depictions of Arab people in popular media is only continuing the anti Arab narrative. When I was in middle school I had people classmates asking me and my siblings if we were a part of ISIS. Positive Arab representation would help squash this racism so fast I feel. I want to have my opinion changed because I would love to see some people say examples of accurate Arab representation that I’ve never seen before. But I have never seen any therefore it’s my opinion. 

Some caviats: 

1. I am specifically talking about popular western media so projects made by the USA/canada/europe not films that were made in Arab countries
 
2. I am not saying I hate the original Alladin but as much as I loved it as a kid it is incredibly flawed and their “representation” is just racist stereotypes. I have a lot of beef with the alladin live action remake because they put no effort into making it actually representative of Arab countries and cultures and characters so I just count that movie as a tasteless cash grab with no actual attempt to do any proper representation.

3. Indian/East Asian films and shows don’t count. I am specifically talking about Arab countries like Lebanon, Iran, Egypt, Morocco for example. I want to give Ms. Marvel kudos for being really good Muslim and Pakistani representation but I can’t count it in this because I’m talking about Arab in particular. 


The closest thing I’ve seen of popular proper Arab representation is Moon Knight. The main charachter isn’t Arab just the setting so I don’t count it. But the Arab music is fire so it gets kudos from me. The work they did to make the setting accurate was enough to make me happy. I want my opinion to be changed because I would LOVEE to see some people put from good Arab representation media in the comments and prove me wrong. In order for it to count, the main character, protagonist, or hero has to be an accurately represented Arab character, preferably in an Arab country or setting. Side characters can also MAYBE change my opinion depending how relevant they are to the media. The whole point is it’s proper representation not just a token Arab character that has zero depth.

1cbrfoe,"CMV: American Jews on the Left are expected to tolerate a level of blatant antisemitism from POC, both personally and more broadly, that would be inconceivable if roles were reversed.

Or, if they do think it’s antisemitic they think it takes a backseat to their own struggles against discrimination. Because — most of them — are white. If they think about it at all.

This isn’t to say that there isn’t *lots* of work to do in the “white” community still when it comes to race relations *and* antisemitism or that this discrimination cancels out the other, it’s just to say that this is a real problem in the black community.

And if you agree protocols of the elders of Zion is antisemitic book, then you’d agree that an organization that takes its cues on the topic of Jews from such a antisemitic book would likely be, by extension antisemitic. Well early NOI was very much such an organization. And if that organization had deep roots in certain segments of black America it would probably be somewhat worthwhile to consider its effects.  

All this to say, there’s a reason Kanye West — who coincidentally also defended Louis Farrakhan from correct accusations of antisemitism — is still embraced by hip-hop fans and rappers today and if anything seems to be making a comeback of sorts.

Not that me saying this really matters. The people whose opinion this would change don’t read this and they’d only listen to people they respect within their local community. But it does look, to the outside viewer at least, that there’s a lack of reciprocity. 

During the George Floyd protests the arguments for taking to the streets to demand justice and reform society o prevent antiblack racism from killing more Americans or destroying more lives, were rooted in appeals to fundamental appeals to human rights to God. You can’t use that as a cudgel to motivate and shame people into action then turn around and ignore it or say “why they gotta drag black people into it”. Especially when it’s your fellow countrymen.

Nuclear takes much less area of land, whislt surely It is very expensive at First, It can pay itself within years operating and It can last for decades until major refurbishment is required.

1cdcbrh,CMV: I believe that forced Conscription is akin to slavery and never justified. A society unwilling or unable too generate enough volunteers for its armed forces is not worth defending.,"Conscription is one of the worst infringements on personal life and liberty: First, young people (usually only men, which is a great injustice) are forced to perform forced labor for their government with very little compensation.

People who refuse to perform that forced labor usually are imprisoned for multiple months (if alternative service is available that does not change anything because it is still forced labor and refusing alternative service too usually will mean imprisonment too).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Secondly, it is even worse if that country is at war: Then the infringement upon the rights of the young people is even greater, because now thy are in massive danger to their life. It is also worth noting that conscripts in almost all circumstances very quickly turn into chess figures that is at the government's disposal for their own politics.

The best instances for this are: The Vietnam War (North Vietnam did not attack the U.S. and did not pose a threat - in fact, after they won in 1975 they did not retaliate).

Even Israel's Gaza War, while in principle justified, could be considered to be prolonged by Netanyahu for ulterior motives.

Similarly, the Ukraine-Russia War, while Ukraine is defending itself, their government refuses to even consider accepting giving any territory to Russia, preferring to sacrifice hundreds of thousands young men on the battlefield. The same applies to Russia, which is also willing to send their people into battle as cannon fodder.

Both countries have instituted measures to ban men from leaving the country. Ukraine deployed tens of thousands of soldiers to their borders with Nato countries with orders to shoot anyone trying to leave the country. Hundreds of men have perished trying to escape Ukraine.

This reminds me very sadly of the criminal activities by communist East Germany, which also shot people at the border who tried to escape the country.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In my opinion, these massive infringement upon the rights of individuals bears no justification whatsoever. While I do see the need to ensure national defense, I do not think that if the government, the society as a whole, is not able or willing to institute the necessary measures relying solely on volunteers, then this country and its people are to blame for themselves if they get conquered - because apparently, there were not enough people voluntarily defending it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I would also stress that in modern military technology, there is no real need of conscription because, for example, a strong air force of hundreds of modern fighter jets, as well as drones, plus an army with many tanks, artillery pieces, rocket artillery and similar technology, will beat a large army of men armed with rifles.

The farthest I would be willing to compromise on would be to formally have conscription (for all genders, of course), but if one refuses they will only face a fine, for example $ 1,000, and no other consequences at all. This way, some people who would not join the army on their own iniative, but are not actually opposed to it, would enlist because they formally have that duty. On the other hand, anyone really opposed to conscription would not be held to forced labor nor harshly punished, but basically giving a small contribution to national defense with their money.",dwujd,312,0.6200000047683716,597,1714105491,2024-04-25 23:24:51,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cdcbrh/cmv_i_believe_that_forced_conscription_is_akin_to/,4,2024

1cde8zg,CMV: Red Flag Culture is overreaching,"
I want to set the tone that I'm a Single Black Male 30-35. 

I've had some recent run in issues with my dating life that I feel as though it's backwards over the past 5 yrs or less. I'm heavily independent. I work two jobs (medical and restaurant). I can cook. Clean. Pay my bills. Have great sense of style. Well mannered and self caring in the best way. 

My issue is that some of my activities I've been told are red flags in the dating world. 

Said things are:

My closest friends are women. They have men. They have families. I have not had sex with them. We respect each other greatly in high regard.

I do ""couples"" activities by myself. I grocery shop. I got to local mall. I go to the movies by myself. I take long drives my myself. I travel to tourist attractions by myself. I go to farmers markets and local fairs and events by myself. 

I don't lock my phone??? Or I put my phone away when they are in my presence and use it less. (this one I've explained as a matter of focus and I'm not hiding something)

Im comfortable with them not texting me, or I text them for 24-48 hours. We all have a a life to live. It happens, life goes on. 

Low social media presence. I have a Facebook for friends and X for hobby groups. 

Going to restaurants by myself or even high end restaurants by myself. 

You get where I'm going with this. 

Now I didn't realize it had became an issue until a recent FWB came in contact with me again and wanted to offer an apology. I accepted to meet up and she explained that she was a Tik-Tok user and she came across videos that covered many things that I do as ""Red Flags"". My face must've spoke for me because she said ""let me explain"" and proceeded to tell me that she watched these videos over a few weeks and came to the conclusion that I was a big walking red flag. I followed up with the fact that we had flawless communication about everything in our lives so I don't see how she reached that conclusion when she knew everything. Needless to say, she felt ashamed. It was only after we stopped talking for a few months and she talked to real women in real life with boyfriends and husbands and etc that she realized she fucked up in her way of thinking. We finished, I accepted, and we went our separate ways. 

Since then I've seen it everywhere. It was like my eyes were opened. Facebook. Reddit. Twitter/X. Instagram. I've even heard some in person. Normal every day stuff that I thought that men were being men, is getting marked as a red flag in dating culture. I don't mean obvious red flags.

 I feel as though it's turning into an escalating issue that's taking away from what real red flags are and what you be keeping your eyes open for. Yes, red flags are a very real thing. I do personally think that it's over reaching in many ways. I think that it sets men up for unknown failure. I also think it's gives new and young Men and women unrealistic expectations and skewed views on what to look for in a partner.

1cdekyt,CMV: violence against Asian-Americans does not receive enough media coverage.,"CMV: Asian-Americans are being attacked but nobody cares unless the perpetrator is white. 

I've seen dozens of videos of Asian Americans being killed, assaulted, and robbed. I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not. It's very sad to see people that look like my parents or grandparents being attacked or killed. Not to mention the thousands of incidents where Asians are victimized without violence, or the ones that are not caught on CCTV or cellphone videos. Asians are being attacked and it is not being acknowledged. The media will not report on these incidents unless it is a white person, as evidenced by the coverage of the Atlanta murders compared to violent crimes committed by other minorities. 

Just a few that come to mind when it comes to violence that is recorded:

- elderly Asian man picking up cans and being assaulted by a group of young men in the bay area
- elderly Asian woman being set on fire in New York
- elderly Asian man being violently shoved and later dying of his injuries in the bay area
- elderly Asian woman robbed and killed in the bay area
- elderly Asian woman in New York being punched and kicked 60+ times 
- asian woman in Houston being slammed and paralyzed
- asian woman dragged by a vehicle after being robbed in the bay area
- asian woman being ran over and killed in Las Vegas
- gangs specifically targeting asians and their businesses

And there are many more that I have forgotten to list, and those are just the incidents that aren't recorded or reported. 

People often mention the LA riots in conversations about Anti-Asian violence, especially when it comes to the murder of Latasha Harlins, but they fail to mention the constant victimization of Soon Ja Du, she had visible injuries from that day. She was thrown under the bus by the media and it became the justification for hundreds or thousands of Asian businesses being destroyed along with the countless Americans that it impacted. This is just the most extreme example. 

There has not been enough media coverage on these specific incidents. There has not been the type of movements that were evoked when other injustices are committed. There is no real action that has been undertaken by the the government in stopping the violence against Asians. And there is a general disdain for Asian people that is not being addressed. 

I get that there is a lot of intersectionality that is in play, asians inhabit the same spaces as other marginilized people, but that doesn't mean that they should be left out to dry. 

There is a lot more that needs to be covered, these examples are only the recent ones, but historically speaking, there are many more examples that are being ignored, not just by me, but in general. 

And I will acknowledge the racist sentiments that are held within the Asian community, it does exist, and it has led to discriminatory actions against other minorities. 

Conclusion: I believe that Asian Americans are being attacked, but it is not being acknowledged by the media or general populace when it is done by other visible minorities/marginilized groups. There is a media bias to protect certain groups, and an emphasis on when the crimes are committed by white people.

1cdrc81,"CMV: we should ban entirely the use of ""your honor"" in reference to judges of any kind in a courtroom","Disclaimer: I'm American and have no idea what customs are in courtrooms elsewhere. 

At the founding of the US, there was some question of what to call the executive, George Washington. 

Some had floated ""your highness"" or ""your grace."" Washington rejected these titles, settling simply on ""Mr. President,"" which at the time had very minimal prestige associated with it (for example, a head of a book club). Happily, this trend has continued. Mr. President has stuck.

How on earth do we call even traffic court judges ""your Honor"", including in second person (""your honor mentioned earlier ________"" instead of ""you mentioned earlier"")? I'm watching the immunity trial and it seems absurd.

Not only is it an inversion of title and authority, it seems like blatant sucking up to someone who will presumably have a lot of power over your life, or your case. 

We don't call bosses your honor, we don't call doctors that save lives your honor, we use the term *only* for people who could either save or ruin our lives, or at a minimum give us slack on parking tickets.

I would propose that a law be passed to ban the term in all courts, federal and state, and henceforth judges should be addressed as ""Judge _______"".

1cef383,CMV: The police crackdown on campus protests is a gross violation of 1st Amendment rights,"America is a place where anyone has the right to assemble and voice their opinions regardless of how hateful or bigoted they are. Unite the Right rally was a blatantly antisemitic neo-Nazi rally but it was allowed to take place because of 1st Amendment rights. The Jan 6th protests were fine up to the point where the protestors decided to storm the Capitol building and launch an insurrection. However, these campus protests have been cracked down in a manner similar to the Civil Rights Movement back in the 60s. Riot police were deployed before the protests started, peaceful protestors were man handled, some were pushed by the police onto the highway so they would be arrested, some were tasered while handcuffed, it's a violent crack down on peaceful protests. I mean, seriously, how is it okay that [a sniper](https://redd.it/1cdfbux) is deployed on a university campus?

Were there antisemitic chants in Columbia? Yes, I don't doubt that, I have seen the videos, but so were the Unite the Right rally that was much more antisemitic than the ones we see in the past week. There wasn't much violence from the protestors either, and even if they were it wasn't the case in all the campuses that faced mass arrests.

But, as I consider what that would actually mean, I’m struggling to think of a crime that I think a president should be able to commit as part of an “Official act.""

Here’s how I’ve though about this: If I’m going to accept the proposition that a President should be able to commit crimes with impunity in the commission of their “official acts"" because the president would otherwise be too constrained, I should be able to identify hypothetical situations where the most desirable outcome would require the president to knowingly (or recklessly or negligently) order a subordinate to do something criminal.

1ch2b60,CMV: Religious people are excessively accomodated,"I believe that the fact that these accommodations must be recognized often amounts to discrimination against those who are not religious as it implies religious beliefs to be more important than non-religious beliefs. To give an example in parts of Canada and in the UK Sikhs are permitted to ride a motorcycle without a helmet despite it being illegal for anyone else to do the same.  By doing this the government has implied that Sikhism is a more virtuous belief than any other than could involve one choosing not to wear a helmet. Another non Sikh could choose not to wear a helmet simply because they believe that 'looking cooler' on the bike is worth the health risk of not wearing a helmet and by not allowing this the government is implying that the Sikh principles are superior to the principals of maximizing how cool one looks. It is also unfair that taxpayers in the countries will be forced to pay the excessive healthcare bills stemming from the more severe injuries caused by the lack of helmet. A more reasonable solution would be that anyone who chooses not to wear a helmet must pay an extra annual fee to cover the added healthcare costs.

&#x200B;

Another better example would be the fact that Kirpans (knives) are allowed to be carried onto airplanes by Sikhs but not by anyone else in Canada. The religious reason for wearing a Kirpan is in part self defense yet if any other Canadian chooses to carry a knife for self defense reasons it is a violation of the law and they would rightly be denied permission to bring one onto an airplane. Therefore self defence as a principle is honored by the government when it is packaged as part of a religion but not when it is just an important belief held by an individual. The Supreme Court of Canada even went so far as to say this about a kid bringing a kirpan to school

>Religious tolerance is a very important value of Canadian society.  If some students consider it unfair that G may wear his kirpan to school while they are not allowed to have knives in their possession, it is incumbent on the schools to discharge their obligation to instil in their students this value that is at the very foundation of our democracy.

this is a perfect demonstration of the mindset I described. As a non-religious person none of your personal beliefs are required to be taken with the same level of seriousness as a religion's beliefs. I fail to see why this mindset should be held as it is not a fact that religion is some kind of objectively good thing.

1cis8r4,CMV: Standing in solidarity with Palestinians does not mean endorsing or supporting everything Palestinians believe in,"When I discuss with people here about Israel/Palestine issues, I will always get accused of supporting Hamas or condoning the Oct 7th attacks because many Palestinians do, but this is a line of reasoning I don't follow. When Nat Turner rebelled and killed more than 50 White people, abolitionists did not stop supporting abolition, in fact he is viewed quite favourably today by African Americans. Or when ANC bombed Church Street which killed 19 people and wounded 200 more, many South African Blacks saw that as justified yet it doesn't mean one should stop opposing the apartheid. Similarly, just because many Palestinians believe that the Oct 7th attacks are justified, it doesn't mean that I think they are justified and, more importantly, that I should stop supporting them in getting their right to self determination.  

The other accusation I get a lot is that I am homophobic to support the Palestinians, which is strange given that I am bisexual myself. Truth be told, when considering all matters in politics, I probably have more in common with the average Israeli than the average Palestinian, but the right to self-determination, the right to safety, and the right to basic necessities are not and should not be conditioned on someone having political beliefs that align with mine. If that is the case then I would not support most self-determination movements in the world because I am solidly on the left on most issues.

I think the converse is true as well, if someone is standing in solidarity with Israelis, I do not immediately assume that they support Bibi or the Israeli settlers (in fact odds are they don't). I am very well aware that someone can simply believe in Israel's right to self-defence without taking Bibi's actual political positions into account.

So I would like to hear why standing in solidarity with the Palestinians necessarily means that I endorse or support political positions that are mainstream amongst Palestinians.",WheatBerryPie,688,0.6700000166893005,1354,1714687498,2024-05-02 17:04:58,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cis8r4/cmv_standing_in_solidarity_with_palestinians_does/,5,2024

In the Palestinian narrative, this is seen as the ""Nakba"". They conveniently ignore the significantly larger number of Jews who were expelled from Middle Eastern countries immediately after this.

Regardless, let's say that this narrative is entirely correct. That Israel is an illegitimate state because of their acts of ethnic cleansing justified through Jewish nationalism. Then it should also logically follow that Turkey is an entirely illegitimate state.

Turkey emerged from the remnants of the Ottoman Empire after the Turkish War of Independence (1919-1923). The establishment of Turkey happened as the result of significantly worse levels of ethnic cleansing and genocides against ethnic minorities. The most obvious example being the Armenians. 1.5 million of them were systemically exterminated in this war. The ideological justification of this is fundamentally identical to that of the State of Israel, Jewish Nationalism or Zionism. Following the war, the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne created a compulsory population exchange involving 1.2 million ethnic Greeks from Turkey and 500,000 Muslims from Greece.

This was explicitly endorsed and enforced as state policy to create an ethnically homogeneous nation. If Israel had the same intentions, they failed. This is not, and has not been reflected in the ethnic makeup of the State of Israel.

The only *possible* difference between these two circumstances that would make Israel illegitimate and Turkey legitimate, is that many Israelis came from Europe instead of the Middle East. However I fail to see how this is relevant to the actual act of ethnic cleansing and population swaps that makes Israel illegitimate in the first place. 

Out of consistency, all pro-Palestinians who think that Israel is an illegitimate state per the principles of its founding should also apply this standard to the State of Turkey and many other states around the world.

All 'anti-zionists', who want the destruction and/or dissolution of Israel entirely (not just them to stop their actions in the West Bank or Gaza and implement a two-state solution) should also be in favour of the destruction/dissolution of Turkey and right of return for all displaced Greeks (and Muslims) from both countries.  
  
The fact that Turks happened to *also* be in modern-day Turkey for a very long time is irrelevant to the question of whether or not ethnic cleansing (or 'population swaps, as it was called') makes the state that did it illegitimate. Saying that Israel is a 'European Colonial Venture' has nothing to do with the logic presented nor do I particularly care about the recklessness of the British Empire in the dissolution of their mandates.

I think I've seen at least ten posts a day about this with the same messages. But I do feel that as someone with barely any personal ties to these conflicts, I feel I just don't really think I can say who is right. Plus having a wide variety of friends and my knack for researching tons of information has exposed me to different views which has made it only harder to truly pick a side of sorts. The only opinion I really have is that I don't want the civilians of the region to suffer any longer, which isn't really that disagreeable. I have several friends who protested and while most of them didn't see too much fighting (their schools mostly just had a two hour rally and everyone left afterwards), the ones who did see battles like at UCLA or Columbia were much more distressed and I did spend some time comforting them as a friend even if I had told them I was more or less neutral, which they understood and had no problem with.

1clrqw2,CMV: future of Islamism in Europe is not promising ,"
I'm ex-muslim and I was worried about what's happening in the last few years where people in the UK chanting for implementing Sharia as well as Germany 

I don't have problems with Muslims just if you want to say I'm islamophobic but I don't want my head to be chopped off because I left my faith for the scientific errors in the Quran which is the word of God 

But I truly believe that stoning to death, killing apostates, cutting hands and doing jihad which is militarily fighting other countries to worship allah and enslaving their women and children and kill men if they defend their land and implementing jyzia to humiliate non-muslims is something bad and inhumane and terrorist 

I think that 1 scenario will happen in the future out of 2 

1. The good scenario 

Europe will organize the immigration policy and the next generations of Muslim will be less conservative and many of them will leave the faith and everything is gonna be fine (most of the ones who want sharia are either 1st generation or 2nd at most) a


2. The bad scenario 

UK will face a civil war from people who wants to implement the Sharia (and yes that's what literally in the Quran, Muslims are ordered to jihad) and eventually the UK will win but after many casualties 


Sorry if that's sounds very extreme but I'm genuinely worried because I'll encounter many persecution if people in my country knows that I'm atheist and maybe I'll be killed if they know and I'm willing to go work in the west and I -for obvious reasons- don't want to be killed there too

The common factor is that all these people did not know about the reality of the job market before choosing the degree that they painfully regret.

1cm7v5h,CMV: There is no valid aviation-safety-related reason for airplane mode in modern airliners,"Airplane mode makes little difference to the navigation or communication capabilities of a modern airliner. First, the bands that a mobile phone tranmit on (800MHz upwards) do not overlap with the coms radio of airliners (100-300MHz for VHF and lower for HF). Second, they largely do not tranmit on the same bands as what’s used for navigation either, and either way ground based navaids are going the way of the dodo, and what’s left that’s commonly used is only ILS systems. One could argue that they may interfere with GPS since they both use GPS, but that’s neither here nor there or else GPS would break down in a slightly more crowded area.  

The simplest way to explain my point would be, if having mobile phones off airplane mode is so dangerous, then terrorists wouldn’t need to go to the trouble of bringing a bomb or some such, they merely need to turn on their $200 phone and that would be enough.  

Finally, to clarify, I am narrowing the scope of this to aviation safety related reasons. I don’t care if your phones might impact cell towers which might just happen to make an emergency call be delayed. And I don’t care if it’s because the law tells you to.

1cm9hsf,CMV: We're losing more and more opportunities for real human contact and that's a bad thing,"First of all I'd like to say that I'm actually quite a shy person in real life and on a personal level I actually probably prefer less human contact but I'm trying to change that and I also just acknowledge that overall it's a bad thing. 

Let me explain what I mean by ""real human contact"". I mostly mean interactions with people you don't know and aren't in your social circle. Here's some examples of this kind of real contact that existed a while ago but are getting reduced. I'm not saying that there's no more human interaction at all and for most of these things the majority remain ""human based"". I'm just saying that there's a trend in this direction.

\* Supermarkets -> more and more cashiers replaced by self-checkout

\* Movie theatres -> more and more tickets being sold online or at self-checkout machines

\* Passport control -> often you go to the e-Gates and no longer interact with anyone

\* Airline check-in -> often done online and you can even drop off your bags without an operator in many places

\* Taxi drivers/Uber -> this is still years away but replacement with self-driving cars

\* Video stores/libraries -> replaced by streaming services and Amazon for books

Of course there's benefits and efficiency to self-checkouts and I'm the first to use them. I just feel like we're losing something by replacing people with automated processes, and it makes people feel less connected to their community or to other people. Yes people can still talk to strangers on social media but that's just not the same.

1cmfr1l,CMV: Dropping birth rates isn't an actual problem. ,"I've seen more and more headlines and news outlets in the last year talking about how horrible it is more people aren't having babies. Everything from blaming selfish millennials to focusing on how our economy can't be sustained without more kids. 

I have so many problems with this. But the main is that it's such a waste of time to keep circling around ""we need more babies"" mind set for our economy. 

We have advanced technology, brilliant scientists, more knowledge at our fingertips than ever before. Why are we STILL so reliant on an economic model in which human population MUST grow or society will collapse one day? Really? No one can problem solve some and spearhead some solutions here? 

Not to mention, we can't just grow indefinitely. Truly, we can't. We've already wreaked havoc on the environment and our natural habitats. We're practically an invasive species. 

Less people in the future means less cars driving to pollute the air, less consumerism, less suburban sprawl to ruin beautiful land with strip malls and mcmansions. It'd also mean cheaper homes in better locations. 

Of course, there are issues with having less young people. The older generation needing to be taken care of seems to be the biggest fear I hear echoed, but again, there could be a solution for that. For example, actually PAYING nursing home workers better and providing benefits so more people flock to the field? Maybe we'll need less schools in the future if there are less kids. Funding and resources can be allocated to the elderly. I'm not even saying that's a great idea. I am not a brilliant scientist or someone with political power. But even stupid me can see that there are ways to problem solve some of the issues rather than blaming the younger generations and forcing women to give birth. 

I'm tired of hearing it talked about. Because at the end of the day, it's a mute point. Women have birth control (for now), and we have a sense of self and the right to choose. We aren't the generations of the past who had 10+ kids. And we probably never will be again. We have to move on and focus on new ways to live rather than trying to boom a population growth spurt when it simply will not happen.

This trend shows just how normalized it's become to generalize all men as potential predators, like we're guilty until proven innocent.

But how is this generalization attitude any different from police who profile black people? Or a TSA agent profiling someone with a turban?

1cneckr,CMV: Ghosts aren’t real and our cultural ideas about them make no sense anyways.,"I believe that ghosts are not a real thing, and that we have very good reasons to be certain that people aren’t really seeing them. A few things that make no sense about common reporting of ghost sightings are:

1.) The ghosts are clothed. But why? Did the dead person’s clothes also have a spirit that hung around lol?

2.) Ghost reportings are always of humans, dogs, cats, or some other animal people like. Where are all the ghost bugs, birds, armadillos, snakes, etc.? No one sees these, but there is no good reason why.

3.) A ghost is a spiritual being without a physical body. Our sense of sight works by photons of light literally bouncing off of the physical matter comprising an object and reflecting back into our eyes. If there was no physical matter (there isn’t in a spirit) then there would be nothing for the photons to reflect off of and you couldn’t see the object. Hence, a ghost wouldn’t be visible to human eyes and so people are not really seeing ghosts.

I believe that most claims of ghost sightings are just people either making stories up (which is why they are often very formulaic and informed by horror movie tropes) or people being mistaken (which is why the sightings mostly happen in the dark, late at night, when someone’s senses are at their least sharp).

I welcome any attempts to try to change my view and make a good case for why ghosts do exist and especially anyone who could explain why my 3 issues above shouldn’t be considered a real problem for those who claim to see ghosts.",Sonnyyellow90,266,0.7799999713897705,321,1715199620,2024-05-08 15:20:20,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cneckr/cmv_ghosts_arent_real_and_our_cultural_ideas/,5,2024

I think the most disastrous outcome for Biden is neither side doesn't feel like they can vote for him anymore in the election, handing Trump a victory.

However, most Muslims do hold those views. My friends in Belgium and France say it's worst there.  In these first world, Western countries Muslims already hold regressive views.

Or racist. Arabs are fine. Islam is not. I hold all 3 religions in nearly equal contempt. However the other two are in the 21st century at least. There are a frightening number of radicals worldwide. The religion itself was built on conquest and spread by the sword. Muhammad was a pedophile. And Islam actually got better for awhile. Then I want to say around the 1700s/1800s you started having these different schools of thought. Then you had Sayyid Qutb come along in the early 1900s. He’s basically the father of modern day Islamism. Let me explain two different kinds of people. 

There is a difference between radicals and terrorists. A small minority are terrorists.

15-25% of all muslims are radical in their beliefs, meaning they believe one or a combination of the following:

1.	⁠Being gay should be illegal.
2.	⁠Honor killings are sometimes justified.
3.	⁠Apostates should be killed.

Even now, it would be easy to identify your fighters and go to war as known combatants, but they refuse and hide. Hamas leadership could surrender and turn over weapons and funds to end the war, but they dont. These things won’t happen because it doesn’t achieve the effect that Hamas desires. 

If Hamas surrenders, Israel looks strong. If they continue playing cat and mouse amongst the local populous, Israel looks evil. Both sides have the ability to stop what’s going on.

Given we're not close to ending capitalism anytime soon politically, the only thing these people can do to end the exploitation is become the business owners and pass on more or all of the value of their employee's labor to their employees. Because they're not greedy, they could get the best workers because they pay more and thus they'd be able to easily wreck their competitors because they don't have that greed factor. The more people who did this, the better for workers and the working class, as more people would be able to work for a company that wasn't focused on greedily taking as much of their value for themselves as they could, and instead focused on fairly redistributing all the company's gains to the workers who created the value.",BoysenberryLanky6112,278,0.6700000166893005,552,1715630184,2024-05-13 14:56:24,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cr8qdc/cmv_for_people_with_an_anticapitalist_worldview/,5,2024
1cs557z,CMV: Disparity in any system is not automatically evidence of discriminatory practices,"This seems to be a common sentiment for a lot of people and I think it's a projection of their ideology, which is one not of equality, but equity.

For the purposes of this post I use the definition of equity as meaning ""Equal outcomes for all identity groups"". But that is not realistic or rational.

Equity is not natural and for companies/corporations for example, you can't expect the demography of the company to match the demography of the surrounding area, and for larger corporations it's especially unreasonable to expect the corporation as a whole to match the demography of the entire country. I'm talking about America, and in a place like America each state has different demography depending on the state and even the county.

But even so, you can't expect the demography of even a county to match every company in that county. People have different interests and capabilities for any number of reasons and that's normal and okay.

I don't think ironworkers are mostly men because they dedicate energy to discriminating against women. Same with construction workers. Or oil rig workers.

I don't think Kindergarten teachers are mostly women because they dedicate energy to discriminating against men. Same with nurses. Or secretaries.

I think this is just a natural reflection of the biological differences between males and females and our natural tendencies, aptitudes, and personality traits.

This could apply to ethnic groups as well, for any number of reasons. Sometimes those reasons seem arbitrary, and that's okay. But I think usually it's cultural.

In 2006, Joe Biden, remarked that ""you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent"". I guess what he meant is that most people who own gas stations and convenience stores are Indian/Pakistani/etc. I seem to recall he made a similar statement during a political debate.

People bristle at comments like these, saying they're racial stereotypes. But they're true? The statistics back that up.

I hope the anti-AI crowd will forgive me, but I had this funny dialogue with ChatGPT just now. In asking about Biden's remarks, it says:

>This remark was widely criticized as being insensitive and perpetuating stereotypes about Indian-Americans. While the comment was specifically about Indian-Americans, it does touch upon a broader stereotype that certain immigrant groups are heavily represented in the ownership of convenience stores and gas stations.

But then I asked it, ""Which demographic group is dominant when it comes to ownership of convenience stores and gas stations?""

And the answer included:

>""...one prominent group is Indian-Americans, particularly those of Gujarati descent. This demographic has a substantial presence in the convenience store and gas station industry.  
>  
>Other demographic groups, including Arab-Americans, Korean-Americans, and Pakistani-Americans, also have a significant presence in the ownership of convenience stores and gas stations.""

So...reality is insensitive? This stereotype is bad? But the stereotypes are literally true according to the data.

Does this mean that the gas station ownership industry is discriminating against white men? I don't see any reason to think so. Why is it a bad thing that certain ethnic groups dominate the ownership of various businesses? Asian-Americans owning laundromats is another one that comes to mind.

My thought is, who cares? Why is this a bad thing? I just see it as another interesting quirk of living in a multicultural society. There are certain things attributed to various ethnic groups for various reasons and that's just part of the delightful tapestry of a diverse society.

The way I see it, it's okay that we have lopsided representation of various groups in various different fields. There are many different kinds of companies/hobbies/whatever, and they have many different kinds of work cultures, required aptitudes and personality types for the employees, and this results in sometimes unequal representation. And that's okay.

I could expand on the title of this CMV to relate to many other, more ""serious"" topics, but that would make this post much longer and much more complicated.

Anyway, a lot of people seem to disagree with the idea that disparity is not automatically evidence of discrimination. Why is that?

1csag26,CMV: There is nothing wrong with female students helping a male teacher unbraid his hair,"If you haven’t seen the news recently JaQ Lee is a teacher that went viral for making a video with his female students helping him unbraid his hair. He only asked his students to help him unbraid his hair because he had a hair appointment after school that day and he wouldn’t be able to unbraid his hair in time if he waited until after school.

Prior to making this video he had already posted many videos of his students. It is very obvious that he loves his job and he loved his students. However recently he was fired for that video. Many people think it is inappropriate for him to have his female students unbraiding his hair even though it is obvious he had no ill intentions against his students. However I have to disagree.

It is a teachers job to build strong bonds with their students. A strong bond between a teacher and their student is the main way for a student to trust their teacher. A student who trusts their teacher is more likely to listen to that teacher when they teacher and is more likely to go to that teacher if they have any issues. It is obvious that this was just another way for him to bond with his students. 

Also it is just hair. People are acting as if the students were putting lotion on his back or cutting his toenails. The students were just helping him unbraid his hair what exactly is the harm behind that.

In the black community many of us don’t have strong male figures in our lives. When a male role model does enter our life we look up to them and admire them. Majority of his students are black. It is very possible that many of his students may not have a male role model in their life and because of the strong bond they have with their teacher they look up to him and admire him. Helping him unbraid his hair is a way for his students to bond with him and show their appreciation for him.

It is very possible that now since this teacher has been fired that the students in that classes grades will drop. They had a lot of trust and respect in Mr.Lee and it will be hard for a new teacher to gain these students trust and respect. The students may not listen in class anymore leading to their grades dropping. A lot of negative things could happen as a result to this school firing an amazing teacher.

But I think regardless of gender, it’s not an unfair standard to want a partner that hasn’t slept around a ton. A popular sentiment online is that if I found out well into a relationship that my partner had slept with 50 people, any emotional reaction I may have can only be the result of insecurity. 

Is it inherently insecure to not want a person who is willing to let their body be used by numerous strangers? At the very least I think I’m justified in thinking “ew”, and that doesn’t have to be because of my own insecurity. 

I’m no prude. I don’t think sex is sacred or anything.

1csqdpf,CMV: Muting mics during a Biden/Trump debate actually benefits Trump's style of debating.,"Biden and Trump are scheduled to debate ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/15/biden-challenges-trump-to-two-debates-before-election.html)).

A lot of people are praising this as a win generally, but especially for Biden because it will stop Trump from interrupting Biden during his responses. I don't think that's right. In fact, I think muting the mics will benefit Trump much more than Biden.

Muting someone's mic when it's not their turn to respond does *not* stop interruptions, it only stops the audience from hearing it. Consider this: Biden is answering a question posed to him. Meanwhile Trump is talking and rambling over Biden. If Biden gets distracted by this (as any reasonable person would), then this could very easily throw off Biden's response. But to the wider audience who can't hear Trump's interruptions, it will simply look like Biden is stammering, stuttering, or otherwise ""too old"". Especially in an era where sound bites and TikToks drive political perceptions, this could end up looking really bad for Biden.

I realize Biden could also employ this kind of tactic, but it's simply not his debate style. Trump's debate style on the other hand is very suited for this kind of tactic.

There could be ways to mitigate this though. Part of the debate rules could include a requirement that both candidates are visible at all times (like a PIP), or the two can be physically separated (like being televised in different rooms). But I think on its own, the rule to mute mics for the person not responding will mostly benefit Trump in the debates.

1cvfy5u,CMV: We should start moving to a point where it’s more widely taught that race doesn’t exist and only ethnicity does. ,"So the premise of my argument is that the mainstream concepts of race cause confusion and ultimately is the main contributor to bigotry. Because although you can still be bigoted towards someone based on their ethnicity / culture someone is still less likely to make assumptions about you based on your outwardly expressed genetic traits and be forced to talk to you first.

This also comes from a personal point of argumentation. So I am mixed, grew up in a predominantly black community, and ethnically I would say I’m “black”, but when asked what race I am I ussually default to just white or mixed as im pretty light with a looser curl pattern and colorful eyes. So now back to this ethnicity thing I have a problem that there is no better description or identifier for the culture that I am apart of other than black.

And then what about a black guy 2 generations suburbanized in a white community, or a white guy in a black community. Is the black guy white now and the white guy black?. What connects them to the other people of similar skin tones other than well, their skin tones. Like to us an Indian is an Indian or a “south Asian” but they don’t get it twisted they got Punjabi’s, Marathis, Gujaratis, Rajasthani and so on. And there are separate rate ethnic groups there that speak I was just naming the main ones.

Most of the world doesn’t have this problem and I think we should abandon this 1600s style way of looking at someone’s identity and heritage.

I don’t like Vivek Ramaswami but he made a good point after his talk with Anne coulter. I’m which he said regardless of his religion he was born in this country his parents assimilated and assimilated him into American culture and he is more American than many white Christian’s out there. In which he was basically saying he fits in better with upper white society than many white people.

I’m not saying to be colorblind but for logical conversation to be had about how unreliable someone’s features are for determining anything about their life or who they are.

Then my last point will be this, so the way it’s ussually classified in America is this, white, black, Asian, Arab, south/Central American, Native American. None of them give any nuance to the identity of that person and a majority of them are just geographic locations and a large chunk of the would gets left out.

The argument is that committing suicide sounds like they're doing something wrong. Since you commit crimes and historically suicide, or attempts to do so were illegal.

But we don't just use ""commit"" as a crime. It's also just means to pledge, or just carry out. You commit resources. You commit to a relationship. You commit energy.

1cwq65v,CMV: it is perfectly reasonable of the ICC prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for leaders of Hamas *and* of Israel for alleged crimes against humanity,"I’m feeling like the world has gone mad in its general reaction to this move by the ICC prosecutor.

We have Biden and others calling it outrageous to suggest equivalence between Israel and Hamas (which it would be) but that’s not at all what the ICC prosecutor has done - he’s just said ‘name’ is suspected of this list of bad things, and ‘name’ is suspected of this other list of bad things, with evidence, and those allegations are serious enough that there is potentially a case to answer. 

I’ve also seen people on Israeli subs saying although they might hate Netanyahu, the ICC has lost the plot. Like: ‘he’s a criminal but obviously not THAT kind of criminal!’, and saying the ICC should turn its attention to the real crims in Russia or North Korea instead. But, jurisdictional issues aside, why would you not want scrutiny of all leaders responsible for massive loss of life? Even the strongest supporter of Israel’s right to defend itself should surely be concerned about how exactly that defending is done? And there are lots of features of Israel’s warfare that should at least prompt cause for concern (disproportionate fatalities, friendly fire, dead aid workers, soldier misconduct)

Meanwhile Hamas says the move equates victim with executioner. Same point applies as above, that leaders on both sides might have some charges in common, but the question in each case is “did this person do this stuff?” NOT “is this person better/worse than that person?” Also I don’t believe there is any doubt that Hamas ordered deliberate killing of civilians and taking of hostages. The whole point of the concept of war crimes is that it doesn’t matter how righteous or justified you feel, or how nasty war is - you should never do them. 

Are we really so addicted to “good guy vs bad guy” narratives that we can’t bend our minds around the concept that maybe two sides, despite all sorts of legitimate grievances, can simultaneously inflict great evils on one another?

Is it perhaps that it’s such a complex situation the moderates stay quiet so the polar extremes dominate the airtime?

Or am I missing something here? I see no sensible reason for calling the ICC’s (very preliminary) move anything other than reasonable, or anything short of exactly what we should want to see in modern civilisation.

1cyfuom,CMV: Requiring landlords to prove tenant damage is more fair than requiring tenants to prove their innocence,"At every apartment I've rented, the landlord can charge the tenant for any damage or uncleanliness that they find. They don't need to provide any evidence or proof that the tenant was responsible for the damage. In order for the tenant to *not* owe the landlord money for this, the tenant needs to have noticed the damage/uncleanliness within the first few days of moving in and reported it to the landlord.

I think this is unfair, because it is unrealistic for a tenant to notice every minuscule damage or uncleanliness within the first few days. For example, most people probably wouldn't immediately notice dust on top of the fridge, but a landlord could charge a tenant for leaving dust on top of the fridge. Many people wouldn't immediately notice a broken blind, but a landlord can charge for this. Most people wouldn't immediately notice a small dent or scratch on the side of an appliance, but a landlord can charge for this.

I think what's more fair is requiring the landlord to prove the previous condition of anything they want to charge for. If they want to charge for dust on top of the fridge, they need a picture showing there was no dust when the tenant moved in. If they want to charge for a broken blind, they need a picture showing that all the blinds are not broken, et cetera. 

This would not only protect tenants from shitty landlords, it would protect landlords from shitty tenants. For example, a tenant could report ""damaged blinds"" seeing that two of them were broken, and they could break 10 more and pretend the original report of ""damaged blinds"" was referring to 12 broken blinds rather than 2. 

Supposing that landlords are required to provide pictures/video proving previous condition - these must be date-verifiable so that the landlord cannot use pictures from previous tenancies.

The postal service, mail, letters, tv radio shows and phones all altered the equation but none more fundamentally then the internet did. The internet offered something unique. The *closest* simulation you could get to having a person/people in the room with you while also being alone. It has the trappings of community but none of the soul.

Low investment, low barrier to entry. Those are the hallmarks of social media. Yes it’s monetized in variety of different ways but on the whole it’s accessible and easily available at no cost to almost anyone. But it’s this lack of investment that causes the problem. People feel less satisfied, more lonely and more disconnected because the crutches they’ve fallen back on — again the path of least resistance — are empty calories. They provide no real nutrition, no food for the soul, they can aid people in connecting but they’re a tool. Not a solution in my opinion. 

My nephew is the textbook example of social media’s failed promise. He’s probably on the autism spectrum, he’s naturally shy and as a result has almost no friends in school. But with social media, game chats and YouTube to provide nourishment it should be no problem right? 

Wrong. 

He’s almost graduated high school and god love him, he’s emotionally stunted. Idk how he’s gonna meet a man/woman, how he’ll fall in love, how he’ll build a network of friends, how he’ll even hold down a job if he’s never exercised, never developed, the “muscles” you need to form meaningful, longterm connections with other humans. 

It’s not to say people like that are doomed. They’re not. I’m not on the spectrum but I had many of the same problems as he did in school but I was forced/forced myself to develop a personality and learn how to work and be social outside of a screen. 

But if you’ve got a collection of electronic crutches to fall back on, you and by extension the rest of your society is going to splinter into smaller and smaller, more disconnected tribes that happen to share the same town, city or country.

1d1adl1,cmv: The Electoral College should not be winner takes all for each state,"I've seen, over the years, plenty of arguments about the electoral college. Ranging from it being a hallmark of our country, a cornerstone that if changed would lead to everything falling, to being a cancerous stain upon what could otherwise be a democracy.

  
From where I stand, the biggest problem with the Electoral College is that each state is winner takes all. Look at Florida, for example. It is a state which, for the most part, is 50/50. A nail biter of counting, where nobody knows who will get all of the votes. Entire elections hinge upon such counting. And then other states, which are solidly blue or red....they don't matter. Because everyone knows which party is getting all of the votes. 

  
So, where do I stand? If you get 50% of the votes in a state, then you get 50% of the electoral votes. Odd numbers go to whomever get more. Florida, for example, has 125 electoral votes. In 2020 Trump got 51% of vote, meaning he got all 125 electoral votes. I argue that he should have gotten 63. 

  
By splitting it this way, every state becomes in play. Let's say democrats get 40% of the vote in Texas. Usually that would mean absolutely nothing, but now it means 40% of the electoral votes. The same for Republicans in say, California. This makes every state a battleground state, and every vote matters. Candidates can't ignore the vast majority of the country, and nobody would be able to shrug and say that their vote doesn't matter because of the state they live in. 

  
I honestly can't see any downside to this. But when I posted something similar in a different subreddit, I got downvoted with no replies, and that means that there are different points of views. So, I'm posting this here, as  I am willing to have my view changed on this.

1d1h20u,"CMV: Being homeless is a situation that is next to impossible to get out of without financial assistance, and or free room and board for at least a couple of months. This could be from any source. Expecting someone to do it alone is unrealistic. ","Alright, so disclosure, I’m homeless currently. I’ve been homeless for roughly 7 months now. So I have a different perspective on this than probably the majority of people who might see this thread. I also have had the better part of a year to get a closer look at how this really works and what options are available. 

So imagine this scenario: You receive disability income at $900 a month. You do not have a permanent residence. Your disability stipulates that you can earn up to an additional $900/mo before losing benefits. You receive a check on the 3rd of every month for $900. 

Okay, so on the 3rd of, let’s say, June, you check into the cheapest motel you can find. It’s $76/night, or $350/week. No monthly rate. That means a month is $1,400. Already more than you have. The most you can afford is two weeks, for $700. Now you have $200 left. You will need to use this money for food, unless you have EBT. Let’s assume you do, and food is not a cost you have to be concerned with. Your checkout date is June 16th.

Let’s say that on day one you apply at, say, McDonald’s, and they hire you, on day one. And you begin work on the 4th of June. Both of those things are unlikely, but let’s roll with it. 

They have presumably agreed to hire you part time, and keep your monthly pay at under $900. Let’s also assume that you started work at the perfect time in the pay period, and you will be paid in exactly 1 week and 6 days. Also unlikely. You will be paid on June 17th, and will be evicted from the motel the day before you get paid. But you’re tough, you sleep in a park that night and roll with the punches. You get paid $450 before tax, so probably around $400 after taxes, generously. Congratulations, you can now afford another whole 7 days in a motel! 

Unfortunately, you won’t be paid for 14 days, with no reliable or consistent way to bridge that gap. Homeless shelters are frequently full, and rarely near where you need to be to work. They also have strict curfews, and no excuse (even working) will bypass that. You probably also haven’t got phone service, because the entirety of your money is going to your motel. This means you cannot call a shelter before heading to it to see if they have a bed, not that it would matter anyway as they don’t reserve them. So you will waste away your entire day and or night walking around to find a place to stay. 

During this time, you will more than likely be fired, as you have nowhere to sleep, no way to shower, nowhere to put your belongings (whatever they may be) no way to wash your clothes, and ostensibly no food to eat. You will try to show up for work, because you’re not a quitter, but you’re haggard, tired, and smelly, not to mention fatigued from lack of nutrition. 


This is just a taste of the struggle of the cycle of homelessness. You could change my view by demonstrating that my assessment of the situation isn’t accurate, and provide me with evidence.

1d1pqxa,"CMV: If you believe that the 2020 election was 'stolen', then you must concede that voting for Trump in 2024 is a waste of time/lost cause. ","Election season is coming up, and my mostly conservative family who can't stop whining about how the 2020 election was stolen are ramping up their ""you need to vote for Trump,"" rhetoric. However, this doesn't make sense. 

If you truly believe that the 2020 election was compromised by the deep state/George Soros/the Democrats/whoever Alex Jones is blaming this week, in favor of Biden, then it doesn't make sense to even bother voting for Trump. 

Typically when I hear this argument, it follows that there are some sort of vague background characters acting under the eyes of the American public, pulling strings to subvert Trump. Why wouldn't this then occur again in 2024? If you truly believe that, then by the logic of your own worldview, Biden is guaranteed to win again, and you're wasting your time by even walking to the ballots on Election Day. 

I think the only way you could convince me otherwise, is by demonstrating that something about the election process has changed fundamentally for this upcoming election, that essentially limits/disables the unseen actors from performing the rigging again. However, I don't think you could reasonably even scrape that point together, because if anything, the circumstances would only be more against Trump for this upcoming election. In the last election, Trump was at the very least in charge of the Executive Branch. Now Biden and Kamala are in charge, meaning that the 'deep state democrats washington elite cabal' or whatever, have EVEN MORE of an upper hand in playing around with the votes. 

If Trump, while president, had the election unfairly taken away from him in 2020, because the elites rigged the election against him, then it stands to reason that the now only stronger elites would do this again, meaning there's literally no reason for anyone to go cast a vote for him.

Bibi has already called it a [""tragic mistake""](https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/netanyahu-acknowledges-tragic-mistake-after-rafah-strike-kills-dozens-of-palestinians/) and the IDF will investigate the incident.

This is not the first time the IDF has had a high-profile incident that warrants investigation. Others include the killing of 7 WCK aid workers, the killing of the 3 Israeli hostages, and the Flour Massacre that killed more than 100 Palestinians. In the case of the 7 WCK aid workers, the investigation was reportedly [""hurried completed""](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/05/israeli-inquiry-blames-wck-aid-killings-on-grave-errors-by-military-personnel) and was unlikely to be [transparent and honest](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/02/israeli-strike-on-jose-andres-aid-group-prompts-new-level-of-us-backlash-00150245).

1d3jdol,CMV: There is much subtext to the Israel - Hamas war.  But not everybody gets this.   Bad actors ON BOTH SIDES constantly shift between the specific and the general to muddy the waters and make progress difficult,"

I don't think anybody has covered themselves with glory, post 10/7. When Chuck Shumer publicly calls out Benjamin Netanyahu, on the floor of the United States Senate, then it is clear that Israel, under Netanyahus leadership, has gone off the rails. What happened after that? Chuck Shumer was called an 'anti-semite,' and Israel kept barreling down that path.

This is a lot of anger at Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, all of which he has earned, and which he hides behind the Israeli people to avoid, calling any and all criticism of his specific actions just general anti-semitism.

I also think people conflate the Palestinian people with Hamas.  Hamas, ostensibly, is the governing party in the Gaza strip, but Hamas, as an organization, derives from the Muslim brotherhood, is largely funded and fueled by non-Palestinian Arabs who are hiding among and behind the Palestians in Gaza, more than half of whom are under the age of 15.    The October 7 attack was not a legitimate piece of governance, but a specific attack on Israelis and and a continuation of the oppression of the Palestinians.

With specific regard to American protestors I think the fact that this is happening now, when the Shoah fades from living memory, and much history lies between us and World War II, is of interest. I would venture to guess that the majority of people protesting, and most of the younger ones, grew up in a relatively peaceful world with a strong Israeli nation, and don't have the historical context to understand the Jewish state: they may regard it as just another country, acting badly, and protest accordingly. This may, fairly, be regarded as a form of naivete. That is, at least, how I regard it. But there are two, small but vocal groups who have a propensity to hijack the narrative. The first is the amoral pugilist: they just love to fight and will employ whatever dirty tactics necessary to prevail. They will employ anti-semitic tropes to put people off balance and 'stir the pot.' The second is the true anti-semite, who see, in Israels present behavior, an excuse to let their hate flag fly. Both of these groups, I venture to say, take advantage of the naivete of the majority to push their anger and hate and derail any manner of constructive dialogue: call it the Yigal Amir veto, if you will. 

So it is valid criticisms of specific actions, by belligerents, (Netenyahu, et all, and Hamas)  that are then attacked as support for generalities: Pro-Palestianian is equated to Pro-Hamas, and criticisism of specific Israel action is termed generic anti-semitism.  All of this muddies the water and makes resolution of this so much more difficult, which is what the haters, on both sides, want.

1d614o5,"CMV: People are treating mental disorders like they’re zodiac signs or personality tests. It’s dangerous and weird, but it’s the price we pay for lowering the stigma around mental illness.","I have ADD. I was diagnosed as a child and I’ve lived with it for most of my life. My mother has issues with anxiety, depression, and hoarding. My sisters struggle with the former two. None of us, however, *identify* with our illnesses to the extent that we turn it into a personality trait. We’re shaped by it but we are not *it*. This is where I think there’s a problem today. People are becoming tribal around the ideas of mental illness. Autism, ADHD, Bipolar, Anxiety, Tourettes, the more the concepts and language of academic psychology and psychiatry bleed into everyday life, the more people are going to construct their identities around it.

But I don’t think that’s healthy. I’m sure there will be plenty of people who respond to this who will say they’ve found community, connection and understanding through meeting/talking to others who share their illness. But when something as expansive yet also nebulous as mental illness is gets boiled down to 30 second tiktok video, we’re risking over expanding the definitions of illness so that they’re otherwise meaningless. Take a look at r/adhd for example. I’m a member of that group but I don’t frequent it often because the sheer amount of things people attribute to their ADD is ridiculous. People fail to understand the difference between correlation and causation and as a result we get posts like “I don’t like eating cake. DAE struggle with eating cake as an ADHDer??”

That’s a crude parody but it gets my point across. People are associating things to mental illness that are just normal human likes/dislikes. Yes, people don’t like doing laundry or brushing/flossing their teeth. Nobody, unless you love the sensation of floss on gum, enjoys doing chores. That’s why they’re called chores. If they were fun to do we’d call them “fun tasks”. But associating the dislike of chores as something inherent to ADHD is silly but when you take an idea like that, throw it into a lively internet community and combine it with the human desire to understand themselves or find a roadmap to building an identity you begin to the same “trait” adopted by others.

Most “neurodivergent” brains show no major differences from other humans brains. There are no “depression fingerprints” on the brain that allow people to identify a brain that has depression from a brain that doesn’t. The same principle applies to all other mental illnesses. It differs from person to person to person who are in turned shaped by their family, culture, and upbringing. But people want that roadmap so they’ll flatten that wide expanse into a flat binary of “ADHD” and “NON-ADHD”. Take the DSM for example, they tried to eliminate the diagnosis of aspergers and combine it with autism if I remember correctly but when people who’d identified as being “ASPIES” found out, they howled in protest at their erasure.

But, unfortunately, I don’t think there’s anyway to avoid this. The more we talk about something, the more we lower the barrier for entry. The more we lower the barrier, the more people can glom onto it for identity building. Kind of like the kids who, when I was a young, would fake cut marks on themselves to seem edgy and for personality fodder. But now we get it for every mental illness imaginable. To add a final point to this, I think the minute we start making other people’s symptoms iron laws for our own personalities is the minute we begin to limit and create reasons for why we “can’t” do something. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

We constantly talk about how much trauma there is in the world, how easy it is to be traumatized, how sensitive we have to be to other people’s trauma and how trauma trauma trauma can be and now we have high schoolers and middle schoolers claiming they have PTSD at rates combat veterans don’t have. Maybe some of them do, but I don’t think kids in the United States have it harder or that their classmates are any crueler then their grandparents generation before them. Or even my generation now. So either people have a bunch of repressed trauma a la’ the satanic panic of the 80’s that they’re discovering or people are using it as a clay to sculpt a personality from.",nowlan101,1690,0.8600000143051147,300,1717288429,2024-06-01 19:33:49,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d614o5/cmv_people_are_treating_mental_disorders_like/,6,2024
1d6iy5e,CMV: The only requirement to celebrating pride is being a proud LGBTQ+ person or a straight ally with no other political stances unrelated to lgbtq rights being necessary.,"It's pride month. I am a gay man. I'll see posts and such from friends along the lines of ""You can't celebrate pride if you're not against Israel in their conflict with Gaza. You can't celebrate pride if you don't believe in BLM.""

I personally believe both those things. But I think it's dumb to gatekeep pride with sentiments like that. That you're not allowed to celebrate pride if you're not in lockstep with other political causes. I think that logic is wrong. Here is my reasoning. 

1. You can say it's about ""gay people's protest against oppressor so that means you must be against other forms of people protesting against their oppressors"". But there's plenty of examples of people rising up against their ""oppressors"" that I'm sure most western progressive thinking people wouldn't agree with at all. It's not about standing up against oppressors in general. It's specifically and exclusively about LGBTQ+ people standing up to their oppressors, gaining rights, and creating better lives for themselves, and celebrating how far we've come.
2. I believe it holds up an oppressed minority group up to a higher standard. Simply because a person is gay that means inherently that have more of a responsibility to be support of all other causes of inequality? That's dumb. They should be against other forms of inequality because they're a human being, like anyone else should, that has nothing to do with their sexuality of gender identity. I get you can say it's hypocritical, but that's such a naive way of thinking of it. In a perfect world yes hypocrites wouldn't exist. But anyone of any demographic, oppressed or otherwise, has just as much likelihood to be a bigoted asshole. Telling an lgbtq person they're supposed to have some sort of inherently quality because they are lgbtq is exactly the type of stuff we're fighting against. 

I'm open to having my opinion changed, but frankly it's pretty inconsequential for me because I agree with most of the causes I've seen it being compared to and needing to support. The only one I saw that I was a little iffy on was being against fatphobia. I don't make fun of overweight people, in fact I'm attracted to bearish men, and I think it's great plus size people are getting more media exposure.

A lot of parents leave their seemingly healthy children the moment they get diagnosed with incurable deceases.

1d8308p,CMV: Castle doctrine is a good idea. Stand your ground is not.,"With castle doctrine, the point is that you have a right to defend yourself in your home. It essentially says, well, in the home, we don’t know if you’re lying or telling the truth about an intruder being a threat, so we will give you the benefit of the doubt because it’s your property. Also, this includes the fact that you’re unlikely to be able to retreat safely in your home, so you may be even more justified in using lethal force. 

Stand your ground is essentially castle doctrine but just apply it everywhere. But it is that application of it everywhere that is the exact issue in my book. First off, in public, you don’t have anymore right to be there than the person you believe is attacking you, so you should not be able to be the one who decides if your life is in danger or not. Additionally, it is generally much easier to retreat in public than in your home. 

Another thing is that stand your ground can be easily abused. Someone can just shoot someone and tell the police that the person they shot did x or y. 

Now, if someone does retreat and then has no choice, or is unable to retreat, then yes, deadly force is fine but this is true in all 50 states and doesn’t need a stand your ground law.

It makes sense that you can defend your castle without needing to retreat, but the entire world was never your castle.

1d8511u,"CMV: Marrying someone who is straight, while you yourself are gay and hiding it, makes you a horrible person.","Over the years I've watched or heard, of stories involving gay partners coming out further along in life after marriage. 

If you know you are gay and you commit to a heterosexual relationship without conveying that information to your partner, you are a liar and a genuinely horrible person. Both to yourself and your partner.

I would like to clarify that in this post I am strictly speaking about people that know they are gay BEFORE they commit to marriage. If you find out your sexuality later on in life, that's unfortunate for the other person but not your fault.

The single most important factor in a healthy relationship is trust. Withholding something as significant as, ""not being attracted to your partner"" is the ultimate level of betrayel.

Being born into an anti-LGBTQ+ family is not an exception. You have a moral obligation to not marry someone who is hetero and distance yourself from your family. I know that sounds harsh but that's how I feel.

A really popular show that addressed this was, ""Grace and Frankie"". A Netflix series about two middle aged women finding out their husband's have been together for the majority of their marriages and the fallout afterwards. 

On twitter I saw that people really liked both the gay husband's but I just couldn't bring myself to. When I looked at them I felt anger and frustration that they would do something so backhanded and disrespectful to their partners. In the show they even said they, ""loved them"" but you don't lie to someone you love for 30+.

1d8ys0n,"CMV: The popular refrain in American politics that ""both sides are equally bad"" is really just a refuge-seeking device for conservatives who are embarrassed by the GOP but plan to vote for them anyway","You hear some variation of this all the time when engaging in political discussion:

- Both sides suck;

- All politicians are crooks and cannot be trusted / I hate all politicians;

- The whole system is broken and needs to go;

- Etc. 

However, I've yet to come across someone who says this and votes liberal / Dem. It's ALWAYS people who vote GOP / conservative saying this. After all, if it were actually true, you'd see more of a 50/50 split among people who say this and the way they actually vote. 

A careful distinction is the word ""equally"" - the premise held by utterers of this phrase is that both sides are THE SAME level of bad; that they're six of one / half dozen of the other. In other words, this would not account for someone saying something like ""yes, the Democrats are far from perfect and have their issues, but their awfulness does not begin to approach the awfulness of the GOP."" In that way, someone is saying ""both parties have their flaws, but they are not *EQUALLY* bad."" 

My theory is this line of reasoning is merely refuge-seeking for the minority of well-adjusted people who recognize that Trump is a uniquely horrible human being, and that many GOP policy positions are reactionary and retrograde, but for whatever reason (the way they were brought up, peer pressure, their financial position, etc.) nevertheless are looking for a way to rationalize and justify their decision to continue voting for Republicans. If you can convince yourself that the other side is ""equally bad"", then it causes less cognitive dissonance & shame & embarrassment when you ultimately pull the lever for the side that's demonstrably worse.

1d90fx9,CMV: Arabs never criticize other Arab countries. However when it comes to Israel it's the polar opposite.,"First off I'm not posting this to shill an agenda in favor of anyone, I will try to be as apolitical as possible.

As someone who has a North African heritage. Most of my family members hold strong grudges against Israel. But I didn't see any signs of grievance or complaints when other Arab leaders/countries do some sorts of violations. And it's not just my family plenty of Arabs in the Arab world keep their mouth shut when it's another Arab but when it's Israel it's the complete opposite.

Just for context, here's a list of violations and mistreatment Arab countries have done:

\- Al-Assad regime killing his own civilians during the civil war and the casualty count trample the one seen in Gaza. The regime literally used chemical weapons against its own citizens.

\- The Saddam regime in 1). Invading Iran (with the help of the west) in a brutal war where some wild warfare practices were used. 2). Invading Kuwait. 3) Repressing his own citizens and especially Shi'ites and Kurds minorities (Yes I know that Iranians and Kurds in other countries protested Saddam) but the Sunni's in other Arab countries just kept silent.

\- Speaking of Kuwait? How many of you knew that there are actually people indigenous to Kuwait and the government refuse to grant citizenship to. [The bedoon of Kuwait as documented here](https://bit.ly/3yHhhbh). Why don't Arabs protest for their self-determination like they do for Palestinians?

\- The countless Human Rights violations in the Gulf countries starting from the Kafala system (that Qatar rightly abolished after plenty of FOREIGN complaints) to the numerous inequalities women face. I can go on forever here

\- The war in Yemen that caused the biggest massive humanitarian crisis and was instigated by both Saudi Arabia and Iran, again no massive protests was seen in the Arab world to reach a ceasefire.

It seems to me that the only consistent thing here is that when the aggressor is not Arab/Muslim the protests are massively launched, even though Arabs have violated themselves to an arguably greater degree.

Another thing noticed inside the Arab discourse is that the holocaust existence is taken with suspicion and never embraced, same with the Armenian Genocide. Compare this with the war in Gaza where in most mainstream discourse it is referred as an unfettered genocide in Gaza.

Tell me in one instance a sizeable group of Arabs disapproved another Arab country/leader for a particular violation. I'm not talking about government officials, I will change my view if this instance pertained considerable members from society.",holamifuturo,442,0.6600000262260437,337,1717620454,2024-06-05 15:47:34,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d90fx9/cmv_arabs_never_criticize_other_arab_countries/,6,2024

Yes, even if you are a parent.","I am a parent of two very energetic young kids who, like most kids, would happily walk into traffic if I wasn’t holding their hands.

Recently there was a viral video of a woman who went on a long diatribe on why she doesn’t return shopping carts and implied that society asking parents to do so is unreasonable.

I think she’s being incredibly selfish and privileged. There are lots of parents out there, and if all of them followed her example, parking lots would become *much* more chaotic and dangerous places for cars and pedestrians alike.

Here are my very simple instructions for her: Put your kids in their car seats (or lock them in the car if they aren’t in car seats), pump the A/C if it’s too hot, and then take the 15-20 seconds to return the cart. There will always be edge cases like emergencies, people with special needs and not feeling safe if it’s an isolated parking lot, but to not return a cart as a matter of course is just wrong. If you do just a few seconds of planning it’s not that hard. I know because I do it nearly every day, by myself with two crazy kids in tow. I’ve never even considered not returning the cart unless I truly couldn’t, and then I’ll make sure it’s on a curb or something so it doesn’t roll away.

1dbv1el,CMV: The latest IDF raid to rescue four hostages debunks the “targeted operation” myth,"In the Gaza War, the IDF recently rescued four hostages. The operation was brutal, with Hamas fighters fighting to the death to prevent the hostages from being rescued, and civilians caught in the crossfire. Hundreds of civilians died and Israel was able to rescue four hostages. Assuming the 275 civilian death number is accurate, you get an average of 68.75 Palestinian civilians killed for every Israeli hostage recovered. 

This strongly debunks the myth of the so called “targeted operation war” that many on Reddit call for. Proponents say Israel should not bomb buildings that may contain or conceal terrorist infrastructure, instead launching targeted ground operations to kill Hamas terrorists and recover hostages. This latest raid shows why that just isn’t practical. Assuming the civilian death to hostage recovered ratio remains similar to this operation, over 17,000 Palestinian civilians would be killed in recovering hostages, let alone killing every Hamas fighter. 

Hamas is unabashed in their willingness to hide behind their civilians. No matter what strategy Israel uses in this war, civilians will continue to die. This operation is yet more evidence that the civilian deaths are the fault of Hamas, not Israel, and that a practical alternative strategy that does not involve civilian deaths is impractical.

1dcajfe,"CMV: There is no reason to ever allow ""religious exemptions"" from anything. They shouldn't exist.","The premise here being that, if it's okay for one person to ignore a rule, then it should be okay for everyone regardless of their deeply held convictions about it. And if it's a rule that most people can't break, then simply having a strong spiritual opinion about it shouldn't mean the rule doesn't exist for you.

Examples: Either wearing a hat for a Driver's License is not okay, or it is. Either having a beard hinders your ability to do the job, or it doesn't. Either you can use a space for quiet reflection, or you can't. Either you can't wear a face covering, or you can. Either you can sign off on all wedding licenses, or you can't.

I can see the need for specific religious buildings where you must adhere to their standards privately or not be welcome. But like, for example, a restaurant has a dress code and if your religion says you can't dress like that, then your religion is telling you that you can't have that job. Don't get a job at a butcher if you can't touch meat, etc.

1dckxpx,"CMV: In the context of American politics, the term “assault weapon” is poorly defined and the proposed “assault weapon bans” will have little to no effect on crime.","The term “assault weapon” does not have a generally agreed upon definition but in practice it seems to refer to anything that looks roughly like an AR-15 or Kalashnikov pattern rifle. It is an occasionally popular position in the Democratic Party to advocate for a ban on these rifles.

There are two problems with this. 1: The term “assault weapon” is so poorly defined it doesn’t ban weapons with virtually identical capabilities to AR-15s and Kalashnikovs, so it’s trivially easy to circumvent. 2: It is a proven fact that rifles are used in only a tiny portion of violent crime, as a matter of fact bare hands are a more common murder weapon than rifles, as are clubs or knives.

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls

So this proposal does not make logical sense. So-called “assault weapons” are not uniquely dangerous, they are not used in a large amount of crime, and the entire category is cosmetically defined.

I anticipate the primary argument in favor of an “assault weapons ban” to be to prevent mass shooting. This is a foolish strategy for preventing mass shootings as a person who is deranged can use almost any modern firearm to similarly deadly effect in the context of a mass shooting. Any typical handgun like a Glock for example would produce essentially the same deadly results.",Grandemestizo,359,0.7599999904632568,922,1718024461,2024-06-10 08:01:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dckxpx/cmv_in_the_context_of_american_politics_the_term/,6,2024

I'm sincerely confused as to why that would be the case though because: 

1. Hunter Biden is not running for President.
2. Hunter Biden is a 50-something year-old man who presumably made his own choices. It's not like this was the case of a minor where the parents are ultimately responsible for his behavior. 
3. Hunter Biden does not write the President's policies, domestic or international. His conviction has no bearing on how President Biden will govern, set policy, make his budget, etc.  
4. President Biden has been convicted of nothing, charged with nothing. 
5. Donald Trump is literally a convicted felon. Shouldn't being a felon be worse for a campaign than being related to a felon?

My view on gender is that men and women are different, but equal and that they should share positions of power equally. I think the model used by many European Green parties (having two leaders, one male, one female) should be adopted by countries in respect to heads of state and other important departments. 

Ok with that out of the way, on to my main point. If you look at that subreddit on any given day their will be posts celebrating concepts such as “decentralising” men from your life which is described as switching all your service providers (doctor, therapist, electrician) to women, prioritising female friends over male ones, abstaining from any sexual or romantic relationships with men, only hiring women if you are in a position to do so etc. 

Can someone please explain how this is not just the white supremacy of gender theory? They’re using all the same talking points and philosophy that straight up fascists use? 

They regularly advocate for what is essentially a gendered apartheid system and will say that males and male characteristics need to be continually devalued and diminished in society. 

I have never heard any of these ideas said in real life, only on that subreddit which leads me to believe it is a fringe ideology on the edge of acceptable thought and should really be looked at more critically. If you speak to people in real life about gender, the overwhelming majority will agree that cooperation and mutual understanding between genders is essential for society and that increased respect between the genders can only be good for society, and this is the view we should be promoting… surely?!

Also the subreddit operates as a massive echo chamber which is don’t think is healthy, I was banned for trying to discuss the intersectionality of class and gender as from the perspective of a working-class man it seems like a lot of their views come from a position of privilege and do not reflect the realities of working-class relationships, social norms and family dynamics.

1dek023,CMV: People shouldn't vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election because he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election,"Pretty simple opinion here. 

Donald Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. That's not just the Jan 6 riot, it's his efforts to submit fake electors, have legislatures overturn results, have Congress overturn results, have the VP refuse to read the ballots for certain states, and have Governors find fake votes. 

This was bad because the results weren't fraudulent. A House investigation, a Senate investigation, a DOJ investigation, various courts, etc all have examined this extensively and found the results weren't fraudulent.

So Trump effectively tried to overthrow the government. Biden was elected president and he wanted to take the power of the presidency away from Biden, and keep it himself.

Very simply for one single fact: would you still love your partner if they abused you? What about your child? A family member? The vast majority of you will say no. That is the condition. That is where you draw the line. 
I've seen some articles say that ""unconditional love is not unconditional tolerance,"" but love and tolerance are one and the same. Everyone has little quirks about them that their partners don't like. They tolerate those behaviors because they love them. But that tolerance has an end point. And if you reach that end point and your partner does something you can't tolerate then it has reached beyond the conditions of your love. Because if you had unconditional love for them there would be no end to what you can tolerate.

Simply put, these jokes imply that having a small penis is a very bad thing. That it automatically makes you a disgusting, sexist, egocentric loser. The people who make these jokes claim people with small penises must all be insecure, but then deliberately use this humour to cause that insecurity and alienate. It’s like hitting someone and then making fun of them for being in pain. They want you to be insecure and then use jokes to highlight that insecurity.

This concept must be foreign to a lot of people because it actually is possible to be a decent human being with a small penis, but these jokes imply otherwise and are designed to make people conflate small penises with being a vile, woman-hating, insecure, vain prick. Those who make them clearly do not care if they emotionally hurt normal people with small penises, and when we call out their body shaming, that’s when they say “See? You’re insecure!

I am also aware of a sexuality being a spectrum, strictly bi/hetero/homosexual isn't very common here and sexuality of everyone should be respected, always.

1djs0n8,CMV: Just Stop Oil is a strong net negative for the climate action movement,"A few minutes ago, I saw a video of Just Stop Oil painting Stonehenge with some sort of orange paint. This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it keeps escalating.

I believe that their organization is a significant net negative for the climate cause. They are so counterproductive that it seems like they must be paid actors installed by the oil industry.

I personally support climate action. However, many people around me, especially the older ones, are quite undecided. Every time Just Stop Oil commits an act of vandalism, they become more opposed to the cause because they dislike the activists advocating for it.

I also believe that gatherings and demonstrations are a great way to show discontent to the government. However, I would feel really uncomfortable attending a climate march with groups like Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion, as they escalate the protests and create conflicts with the police. I once experienced this firsthand and felt quite uncomfortable. As a result, I am less likely to participate again. I am sure many others feel the same way.

In my opinion, they also greatly harm the climate movement by pushing other causes under the guise of climate action. For example, by protesting against Israel as an organization, they strongly reinforce the narrative that climate activists do not actually care about the climate but are merely leftists promoting their political goals. This again turns away potential supporters of the cause.

1djza5n,"CMV: The Olympics should not include any competition where the results are ""judged"" rather than determined by a definitive measure","Sports where the results are who can run/jump/throw faster/higher/longer etc are what the Olympics should be about imo. 

Competitions where a bunch of people are deciding who *they think* did a thing the best don't belong there.

I tend to think of competitions where the results are determined by judges as ""performances"" rather than sports, whereas sports are competitions where the results are definitively measured. 

It is of course possible to cheat at all of these disciplines, but the biases, experiences, cognitive differences and huge opportunities for nefarious acts are removed from the results when judging isn't involved.

Yes, this means dropping a bunch of competitions that are popular. Gymnastics is the big one I would think. Whilst there's incredible athleticism involved in gymnastics, it's still an athletic performance that is judged by people. Boxing, diving, dressage, these would all be gone.  It would impact a lot of the new ""x"" type sports that have been added recently as well.

1dkd43z,CMV: Most of the hype surrounding AI massively misunderstands how it works and its resulting limitations,"We are currently living in what seems to be an AI hype bubble, with much of the current stock market being devoted to frenzied hype around ‘AI’. However, I believe that none of the people throwing money after this have any idea how AI actually works, and are going to be in for a rude awakening once they realise they are not going to get anywhere near the expected returns on their investments. Furthermore, even those that acknowledge the existence of a bubble seem to do so in ways that have no relation to the fundamental mechanisms of ‘AI’ (defined here as the sorts of generative AI popularised by ChatGPT and hyped up by the current tech industry). This is an attempt to change that.

As far as I can see, there are three main problems with how AI works. Firstly, the ‘ouroboros’ problem, whereby AI ends up consuming a load of its own content and the quality of outputs decrease - this seems to be one of the most popularly states arguments against AI, and won’t be the focus of my argument. Secondly, there’s the problem of small datasets - a lot of problems concern rather niche areas in which there is comparatively little data and literature on - thus will dramatically undermine AI’s ability to deal with these problems and the quality of its inferences will be significantly worse. This I believe is a more significant argument, and definitely plays into my belief that AI is about to plateau.

However, the main one is as follows: to my knowledge, most of the current innovation in AI is in processes that are essentially just super fancy ways of smashing the middle button of predictive text, albeit on more of a sentence and paragraph level. AI models are fed extremely large amounts of data, and essentially spit out the ‘statistical average’ of said dataset based on a given prompt. Because of the way human language works, so long as your dataset is large enough and the statistical models are good enough, this can approximate human speech and knowledge pretty well. However, at no point during this process does the AI ever ‘understand’ any of what it writes. It is able to approximate understanding by using contextual statistical models, but it isn’t able to translate any of it into actual actions that interact with the real world (or at least, no additional progress has been made).

To use an analogy based on the famous Chinese room thought experiment, imagine an English-speaking man in an enclosed room, who does not speak a word of Chinese. While in that room, he is able to find an enormous library of books written entirely in Chinese, with no English translations. He does not understand a word of it, but as he reads through, he begins to notice patterns, where in certain contexts certain characters are more likely to occur after certain other characters and symbols. He reads more and more through the books, and is eventually able to put together a rough model for the continuous patterns he finds. Now, if someone were to post a conversational message in Chinese, he would be able to ‘respond’ in a roughly accurate way (being more accurate the more books he has on the subject and the better his pattern identifying skills). However, if they were to post him an instruction (eg pass me one of your books), he would be no more capable of being able to carry it out than before he read through the pile of books, as he has no way of being able to relate the characters he sees to actual meaning. To use the more traditional Chinese Room set up, there are instructions on the wall for drawing symbols, but none for performing actions. 

This is essentially my understanding of where AI is at - there have been significant advances in providing the pile of books, and in being able to spot patterns within them, however AI is no better at being able to relate its outputs to reality than it was before the ‘explosion’ (and quite often, there are very few books on the subject they are being asked about). That doesn’t necessarily mean that it can’t, but it means that this aspect has to be done ‘manually’ by humans in a way that has not benefited from recent advances. The problem is, this bit is both the useful bit and the difficult bit. Attempting to translate human language into consistent actionable inputs is exceptionally difficult outside of certain environments - there are arguably entire disciplines such as philosophy and cognitive language theory devoted to it (part of the reason why ChatGPT is so successful is that it deliberately avoids doing it, instead focusing on pure statistics). 

However, if you can’t do this, then you essentially end up with an AI almost entirely incapable of interacting with its environment, and it is precisely this form of interaction that most people expect when it comes to AI. To use another example, customer service is an area many people consider to be obsolete following AI. Certainly I can see that an AI can replicate the advice side of things (“Have you tried switching it off and on again etc”), but as soon as you arrive at a situation in which action needs to be taken (eg something’s gone wrong with a purchase), an AI will be either almost entirely useless at solving it, or be stuck with incredibly simplistic responses such as providing refunds. This may change in future, but there is nothing in the current ‘AI revolution’ that has brought us any a closer to this. 

As it stands then, we have a large group of people hurling money at AI hoping it will change the world, without realising that it is barely even capable of interacting with it and certainly not with any niche, difficult areas. This seems a perfect recipe for a dot com style bust. 

This isn’t exactly the most heartening conclusion, and I’m no computer scientist, so it’s entirely possible my understanding of the mechanisms of AI is incorrect.

At the same time, we exist under an economic system and at a primitive-enough technological level (still reliant on fossil fuels, for example) that we damage the planet irreparably for every year we exist in this state. If the birthrate drops precipitously and the population declines, we slow down capitalism's damage, giving us a chance of still having some semblance of a livable planet when we move beyond it.

The fertility collapse of educated people is one of workers using the one vote they have to speak out on the system, the prospects it has given then, and the opportunities their children would have if they existed. This movement toward voluntary childlessness isn't some epidemic of antisocial behavior; it is an outbreak of rationality and compassion. If we keep populating, we persist in a state of congestion wherein human life is assigned such a low value, our societies become terrible places to live. If we stop, on the other hand, we give the species a fighting chance. Voluntary depopulation might also be the only nonviolent way to overthrow capitalism and set us up to create something better when it finally collapses.

Don't get me wrong. Some of the reasons why birthrates are dropping are horrendous. Korean work culture and European stagnation and American inopportunity are not good things. Social isolation and involuntary celibacy (which, I suspect, afflicts many women as much as men) are signs of severe rot in our culture, and we should try to fix those problems. Not all contributors to the declining birthrates are good; some of these are serious issues that deserve address. Still, the fact itself of a negative net birth rate is something that all of us should be celebrating.",michaelochurch,675,0.6499999761581421,514,1719172825,2024-06-23 15:00:25,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dmusxt/cmv_falling_birthrates_are_actually_the_best_news/,6,2024

1dovp7x,"CMV: Not shooting Vladimir Makarov and his gang during ""No Russian"" in MW2 (2009) is one of the dumbest plot holes in video gaming history.","In the mission, you are walking behind Vladimir and his 3 men who are all not wearing any armor for, or protection on, their heads. They do not watch you. They do not even care if you never pull the trigger to kill civilians in the mission. PFC Joseph Allen could have easily shot and killed them all. He had an LMG with plenty of ammo, and was obviously trained in the military to where he could have handled it well. Makarov is even the one closest to you!!

The in universe reason given by Shepherd to Allen as to why Allen is going in to even do this is, and I quote directly from the game, ""It will cost you a piece of yourself. It will cost nothing compared to everything you'll save.""

In no world was any of the potential info that could have possibly been gained by staying in Makarov's circle been worth more than just killing Makarov on the spot. There was a prime opportunity to do what they've always wanted to do and bad/ignorant writing is the only thing that stopped it. 

I cannot think of any valid in universe reasons as to why Allen could not have shot at least just Makarov. In what world does a common-man military member (who is literally one step above private, which means he basically just completed boot camp) not stop the killing of literally hundreds, if not thousands of innocent people, let alone he actively participates in it???

I would have no issue with this if literally ANY coherent reason was given as to why it could not be done. Here's a few things that weren't written into the game, but if they were written in, it wouldn't be a plothole:

1. Makarov and gang is in full bulletproof outfits, obviously not allowing them to be fragged. This is just a character design change. Wouldn't have even needed to record dialog. 

2. Allen is forced to be in front as they don't trust the new guy, so he has to prove himself. You would be shot if you attempt to look at them with your gun, for example. 

3. The airport massacre and kill numbers weren't supposed to be anywhere close to this bad, in the eyes of Shepherd/America anyway. Whether this be because the target was unknown, or something else. 

4. There was someone above Makarov who they wanted, that successfully doing this would have lead them to.

5. Any piece of anything that would have been more valuable than Makarov and the stopping of his future atrocities if it existed. More valuable to everyone, by the way, not just more valuable to Shepherd.

1dp2whk,CMV: It is more likely that Trump is a criminal than that he is being persecuted,"Trump has been convicted on 34 counts and has several state and federal charges pending. This is after literal decades of accusations of criminal activity in his real estate and casino dealings. Trump himself claims he is being persecuted by political opponents:

>When you look at what's happening, this is a persecution of a political opponent. This was never supposed to happen in America. This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot. So if you can't beat him, you persecute him or you prosecute him.

Trump has a long history of skirting laws and shady behavior. This leads me to believe the current charges have merit, and are not persecution or anything like it. In particular, the documents case seems to be a clear violation of Federal Law.

[This doctor was a podiatrist who rented space from Trump's father. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-vietnam-draft-exemption.html)It has been pointed out that this ailment doesn't seem to have had any effect on Trump's golfing.

He settled with the Department of Justice a 1973 charge that he was [illegally discriminating ](https://www.thedailybeast.com/doj-trumps-early-businesses-blocked-blacks)in apartment rental practices.

In the aggregate, Trump has a lot of close connections to illegal behavior.

This CMV is solely regarding Trump, and whether he is likely to have performed actions that warrant criminal investigation. I don't want to hear about the other guy. 

Things that might change my mind: Compelling evidence that the charges do not merit investigation. Evidence that other prominent New Yorkers were charged with numerous crimes when they were not actively testing the boundaries of the law. Maybe something else that I have not thought of.

1drtg6g,CMV: The worst thing the DNC can do right now is nothing.,"The way I see it, there’s three scenarios, but only two are likely.

The first is what I consider the most likely, it’s the thought that inspired this post, and is by far the worst outcome for the DNC. They wait NC (get it?). Biden’s polling numbers don’t recover enough, and, as November approaches, they realize he isn’t going to win, panic, get Biden to step down, and announce a replacement. With a few weeks or a month or two to campaign, they aren’t able to shake Harris’ deep unpopularity and lose. Or,l they go with a different candidate, don’t get their name out enough because they’re short on time, and they lose.

The second is that they do nothing. It’s the second of the two scenarios that inspired this post. They pretend it didn’t happen, continue as before, and run Biden against Trump in a 2020 rematch. Biden, who wasn’t certain to beat Trump before, at the height of his unpopularity, runs amid his low rating, doubts about his mental ability, calls to step down from his own party, and (at least the perception of) a shaky economy and high prices. He loses.

The third, and the least likely, is the winning scenario. The DNC acts now gets Biden to step down, replaces him with a younger, more virile candidate, and all of trump’s doubtful supporters flock to the younger alternative. With the benefit of three months of vigorous campaigning, they take the win.

There is technically a fourth scenario. The fallout from the debate is minimal, Biden runs normally and defeats Trump. If this was likely, we wouldn’t be hearing calls for him to step aside from his own party and from major media outlets.",Separate_Draft4887,484,0.6600000262260437,1129,1719721951,2024-06-29 23:32:31,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1drtg6g/cmv_the_worst_thing_the_dnc_can_do_right_now_is/,6,2024

When people say “person of color”, they’re basically just saying that “person” by itself means white.

And I also think we should stop saying African-American (or even Asian-American) because they have been in this country for as long as white people have. If we continue saying those terms, we might as well call white people “European-American” and call actual Native Americans just “American”.

People don’t call Dutch or Belgians who have been here since 1870’s “Belgian-American” or “Dutch-American”. So why should we call black people who have been here since the 18th century “African-American” when they are just as American as the rest of us?

1ds8oa7,CMV: It shouldn't be okay for human rights become optional when bad things happen to bad people,"This is the post I'm referring to. [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursedcomments/comments/1drzbnt/cursed_chopped/)

I recently read a post(a photo of a fake clickbait twitter thing to be clear, this DID NOT happen) where apparently some man cut off the genitals of his daughter's rapist, cooked it, and fed it to the rapist. Let me make two things clear.

1. I **hate** rapists.
2. I also support human rights.

These things can both be true.

Now, when you look at the comment section, the people who somehow believed the post was real were calling the man a hero, and saying things like ""jury nullification"". This really confuses me. Rapists are bad people, but does being a bad person mean that people should have the right to do just *anything* to you?

My dislike for responses like these are twofold. First, the whole point of human rights is that they are unconditional. The worst serial killer will still get a fair trial-the judge can't say ""it's really obvious now throw them in jail"" You are not a hero or a good person for torturing people necessarily

Second, it's really hypocritical. I hope I explain this correctly but if I don't please tell me. You cannot say ""its okay to torture people I hate"" and then look at other people torturing people they hate and say ""wait that's bad"". This is \[special pleading\], isn't it? Consider public whippings of gay people in the middle east. The people in the comment section will certainly be okay with someone whipping some rapist or predator, but I would argue based on my experience with reddit that most of them would not be okay with the whipping of gay people. I don't think you can say, ""but pedophilia is ACTUALLY bad"" because the people supporting whipping gay people will say ""being gay is bad too""

I support gay people to be clear(Happy Pride Month)and I hope my message there is coming across correctly. Human rights aren't optional for me. There is no ""opt out program"". You cannot torture people, no matter what, or you should be put in a cell as well. That rapist(even though he doesn't exist) should theoretically just face justice, or the closest thing you can get to it.

So why do people celebrate people like this as heroes? Or is this an isolated incident or a joke I don't get?

1dt030v,CMV: There's no way to punish being homeless without perpetuating a cycle of poverty that causes homelessness.,"I've been talking with a lot of friends and community members about the subject of homelessness in my area, and have heard arguments about coming down harder on homeless encampments - especially since [the recent Supreme Court ruling on the subject](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/28/nx-s1-4992010/supreme-court-homeless-punish-sleeping-encampments). And despite the entirely separate humanitarian argument to be made, I've been stuck on the thought of: **does punishing homeless people even DO anything?**

I recognize the standard, evidence-supported Criminal Justice theory that tying fines or jail time to a crime is effective at deterring people from committing that crime - either by the threat of punishment alone, or by prescribing a behavioral adjustment associated with a particular act. However, for vulnerable populations with little or nothing left to lose, I question whether that theory still holds up.

* Impose a fine, and you'll have a hard time collecting. Even if you're successful, you're reducing a homeless person's savings that could be used for getting out of the economic conditions that make criminal acts more likely.

* Tear down their encampment, and they'll simply relocate elsewhere, probably with less than 100% of the resources they initially had, and to an area that's more out of the way, and with access to fewer public resources.

* Jail them, and it not only kicks the can down the road (in a very expensive way), but it makes things more challenging for them to eventually find employment.

Sure, they may not have moved and acted with military-like discipline and cohesion. They may not have carried assault rifles and hid behind cover like actual soldiers.

They may have been as incompetent as the Wet Bandits, but I think we can all agree that the Wet Bandits' bumblingness didn't make them any less guilty of their crimes when they ultimately got caught at the end of the movie. 

Whereas apologists look at the footage of insurrectionists wandering aimlessly around the lobby like tourists and see them just being a wee bit disorderly, what I see is them running around like chickens with their heads cut off, trying to find something to do in furtherance of their goals. They were likely all thinking to themselves ""ok ... I'm inside the Capitol, so ... umm ... what do I do now?!"" Their end goal was still the overthrow of the government; they just didn't have a solid plan on how to make that happen. Again, that doesn't make them ""not insurrectionists."" That just makes them bumbling idiots. Big difference. 

Then, we have Trump himself. Yes, I'm aware the Supreme Court just declared he's above the law. But as far as my vote this November is concerned, I don't give a shit. The man stood back and allowed the rioters to do their thing for HOURS before finally enough pressure was put on him to send in the troops to stop it. 

And yes, I'm aware that he was never indicted for that part. No immunity necessary, he just never technically committed a crime when he failed to send in the troops immediately. DeShaney v. Winnebago County clearly says that ""failure to enforce"" isn't a crime in and of itself. 

But again, as far as my vote this November is concerned, I'd like you to take one guess as to exactly how many fucks I give about that legal technicality. 

Trump insisted that it was Antifa, not his boys, who were actually the ones doing the right. First of all, I don't give a shit, and second, even if that were true, that only gives Trump LESS excuse, not more, for why he didn't send in the troops immediately. If they weren't his boys, then what was his incentive to let them do their thing?!

So no, Trump can 100% kiss my ass. Change my view!",acerthorn3,467,0.6600000262260437,1228,1720017437,2024-07-03 09:37:17,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dufxg2/cmv_the_jan_6_riotinsurrection_at_the_us_capitol/,7,2024
1dugpl3,CMV: Michelle Obama would easily win the 2024 election if she chose to run and Biden endorsed her,"A reuters pool came out yesterday that revealed Michelle Obama would beat Trump by 11 points. One noteworthy fact about this poll was that she was the only person who beat Trump out of everyone they inquired about (Biden, Kamala, Gavin, etc.) 

https://www.thedailybeast.com/as-dems-cast-the-search-light-looking-for-biden-alternatives-michelle-obama-trounces-trump-in-reuters-poll

Michelle Obama (obviously) carries the Obama name, and Barack is still a relatively popular president, especially compared to either Trump or Biden. 

Betting site polymarket gives Michelle a 5% chance to be the Democratic nominee, and a 4% chance to win the presidency, meaning betting markets likewise believe that she likely won't be president only because she doesn't want to run, not because she couldn't win. Even Ben Shapiro has said she should run and is the democrats best chance to win. 

My cmv is as follows- if Michelle Obama decided to run, and Biden endorsed her, she would have very strong (probably around 80%) odds of winning, as per betting markets. You can add on that I believe that no one else has higher odds of winning than she does.

1duo62a,CMV: The idea that any and all government action is inherently a bad thing is toxic to political discourse and only enables authoritarianism,"It’s commonly said in America that “government is the problem” and many people across the political spectrum believe any or almost any government action is bad or wrong by default. Politicians run on cutting regulations, without specifying which ones they’re talking about. They run cutting taxes, without specifying what tax rates they actually want. They run on states rights but don’t specify what rights they’re talking about.

This means that any sort of dialogue about these policies can easily be shut down. How are you supposed to have a discussion on if a particular regulation is helpful or not when you enter into it with the assumption that all regulations are bad? How do we have a discussion on how a federal state should be structured if the default response is that the federal government is always bad? We can’t, because there’s nothing to discuss, we’ve left the realm of practical politics so evidence doesn’t matter. I could provide you with all the evidence in the world that a law will save money, improve the lives of every citizen, and be a more efficient way of running things but that won’t change your mind if you think laws are inherently bad.

Furthermore, this rhetoric makes it easy for politicians to be corrupt because no one cares as long as regulations are being cut. Who cares that those regulations were only in industries the politicians buddies have companies in, or that a law was stopping bribery from happening, it’s cutting tape so it’s fine! And then when surprise surprise these policies make public services worse and the government more corrupt, the politician can turn around and blame the government in general rather than their own policies. Nothing is ever their fault and so nothing will ever be done to fix their mistakes. It also means that important bureaucracy meant to check government power can be cut as well under the guise of “removing red tape” but all that does is make the government more authoritarian with more power.

This sort of rhetoric also gives people the perception that the government as an institution is separate from them and has a will of its own when this is not the case. Governments do what the people running them want them to do, and in the US those people are elected by us. We decide how the government functions even in this corrupt age. The government is a tool, whether it’s helpful or harmful depends entirely on how those in power use it.

I’m totally fine with having a conversation about what powers should belong to the federal vs state governments or how directly democratic institutions should be or the role of the government in society. But our complex modern world cannot function without some amount of government action and pursuing some libertarian utopia that will never happen is silly and stops you from thinking critically about policy. No one thinks any and all government action is good because that would be stupid, and the opposite belief is just as silly yet millions believe it.",LineOfInquiry,401,0.8199999928474426,219,1720037986,2024-07-03 15:19:46,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1duo62a/cmv_the_idea_that_any_and_all_government_action/,7,2024
1duoxb4,CMV: The Lancet and Andrew Wakefield should be legally culpable for their MMR-autism paper ,"Former British medical doctor Andrew Wakefield, along with a dozen other researchers, published an infamous paper claiming a correlation between the MMR vaccine, colitis, and autism in 1998. It was published in the prestigious journal *The Lancet*. The study consisted of a dozen children, with only eight of them endorsing intestinal distress and developmental disorders. Wakefield used it to conclude it could have an effect on the pathology of ASD and questioned use of the combined MMR vaccine. What wasn't disclosed was the lack of informed consent by parents, the literal selection bias, Wakefield's recruitment by lawyers wanting to sue vaccine manufacturers, and Wakefield's profiteering off the research through a single vaccine patent he held and test kits for a fabricated disorder Wakefield claimed he discovered. 

All of this survived peer review, community scrutiny, and media sensationalism. It was not the medical-scientific community that led to Wakefield's demise, it was an investigative reporter who unveiled what did. As a result of the things I listed coming to light, Wakefield was stripped of his medical license and barred from practicing medicine, and only *after* this did the Lancet retract his paper and repudiate him. Of course, The Lancet itself is not innocent either, as they criticized the medical panel that investigated Wakefield and proclaimed he followed proper peer review and medical ethics guidelines. 

Given the damage this scandal caused to public trust in vaccines, science, and the reputation of peer review as a gold standard, I feel Wakefield losing his medical license isn't enough. I think both Wakefield and The Lancet should be open to litigation for any and all harms standing can be established for. I also believe that The Lancet should be rejected by the research community as prestigious. No, The Lancet isn't the only old medical journal to be marred by articles that aged poorly. But fee of those caused the same level of damage this controversy did. 

Hell, Wakefield is still out there enjoying a modicum of public support. And The Lancet is still prestigious, despite the fact it stood behind the article until after Wakefield lost his ability to practice medicine. Neither party is innocent, and both deserve to be buried in bankruptcy.

1duq261,CMV: Christianity’s decline in the west is largely owed to the fact that a vast amount of Christians are virtue signalers who use their “faith” to excuse being bad people.,"I would like to start by saying that I know the title may seem incendiary, but I honestly couldn’t think of a better way to word my position.

I also think it’s important that I used the phrase “in the west” because Christianity is still growing in areas of the world such as Africa and Asia.

Also, I should preface this by saying that my argument cannot be proven by facts. Calling someone a bad person is obviously a matter of opinion, but I feel as though throughout my lifetime I have seen this phenomenon more and more. One fact I can point out is that Christianity is declining in the US, and i believe it is because of the people who falsely believe they are the “good Christians.” Don’t get me wrong, I 100% believe that anybody should be allowed to practice Christianity if they want to, and nobody is inherently bad just because they are a Christian. In fact, I would still say that if I all I knew about a person was that they were Christian, it would be my immediate assumption that they are a good person, as that is the kind of life the Bible teaches that one should lead. I also believe this transcends any one denomination, although what I’m discussing is definitely more common in more radical denominations such as Baptists.

I’ll be honest, this is an argument that is founded primarily on personal experience. But there are still plenty of examples of this occurring in the public eye. Conservative figures like Nick Fuentes and televangelists like Kenneth Copeland lead, in my opinion, extremely unchristian-like lives yet still use their faith as a shield in many cases. Also, a staggering number of churches have been exposed as being parts of human trafficking rings in the last 10 years. I don’t want to seem like I’m generalizing all christians; I am merely bringing up examples to show how this phenomena is a large contributor to the decline of public trust in Christianity. 

I know that sin is expected of humans, but it seems like some of the largest sinners want to let the whole world know they are Christians and hide behind their faith to excuse their bad actions more than the Christians who keep to themselves.

I’m sure many of you know people in your personal lives that fit into this criteria as well. I think that the growing number of Christians-in-name-only are, to their own obliviousness, causing the decline of Christianity. It makes people lose trust in the organization, because, like with many other discourse groups in America today, the loudest members tend to disproportionately represent the group as a whole. Actions speak louder than words, and just because a person gets up early on Sunday to sacrifice an hour or two out of their day does not by default make them more virtuous or moral than someone who doesn’t. I fear that this post is starting to sound more like a rant than a civil viewpoint, so I will leave it at this.

Anyway, Islam is a terrible religion. Like uniquely bad. Its treatment of women, queer people, minorities, etc is horrendous and should be universally condemned worldwide. I will not respect a religion that stones women to death for not wearing a cloth covering a natural feature of their bodies. I don’t care if it’s Islamophobia, if it is so be it. 

On top of its discrimination and cruelty, no other religion has followers that fly planes into fucking buildings and throw people off buildings in the name of Allah. Every person should be rational enough to put morals ahead of religion. No matter if the person is Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, etc. ISLAM IS THE ONLY RELIGION THAT STRUGGLES WITH THIS. Let me be clear for you reddit intellectuals, there is no other major religion that acts this way. None. No other religion has morals that are stuck in the stone age like Islam.

1dw7szc,CMV: Imprisoning CEOs of companies that hire illegal immigrants would effectively end most illegal immigration. The fact that any policy like this hasn't been proposed is proof that neither American party wants to actually address the issue. ,"Here is how you end illegal immigration in the US. 

You don't build walls. You don't increase border security funding. 

You curb people's desire to come here. 

Why do they come here? Despite being illegal, thousands upon thousands of American businesses hire illegal labor and pay them cash under the table. 


ICE could be converted into a Labor Auditing department (we may already have one but since it's obviously not effective, I'll refer to making a new one) that is funded effectively and whose goal is to audit all business employees to make sure they are legal. Not only will NEW-ICE conduct audits, they can conduct undercover operations on large organizations to find out if they are hiring illegals. 

If a business is found to be employing illegal labor, the hiring managers and CEOs could face 2-3 years in prison. This will encourage business leadership to heavily audit themselves and ensure that when NEW-ICE comes investigating, their books are clean. 

It wouldn't address the illegals that already live here. But when these people can't find work anymore, word will spread and they will stop wasting their time crossing into a country where businesses are too scared of imprisonment to hire them.

Thats my proposal. 

Here's the thing, I don't want you to CMV on why that proposal is a bad idea. 

I know it's a bad idea. It's a great solution for solving the issue Trump brought up after every question during the debate. (migrants flooding in). 

People truly don't understand how ingrained illegal labor is in our society. Do you know how much of the food you get from grocery stores has been handled and processed by illegal labor? It's one of the reasons prices are so low. 

People would freak out if produce prices doubled over even tripled because companies have to pay higher wages to American or legal work visa owners to harvest their produce. 

Both parties know that actually fixing illegal immigration would be a disaster for their reelection chances. As we've seen, rising food prices, gas prices, and inflation are most people's top priority politically. 

Is it right that companies exploit cheap labor? No. But since when has the American voter cared about morals? In our individualistic society, we care far more about our bottom lines than ethics and working conditions for non Americans. 

Nobody wants to fix illegal immigrants coming in because we need them to sustain our 1st world lifestyles. 

And yet, we fight over it and catasrophize it because most people are dumb, uneducated, and do not understand the complexities around it. 

Which is why you shouldn't vote for either party based on their border policies. Look at other policies they propose because they are straight up lying to you about the nature of immigration in this country.

1dx9e4e,CMV: It is wrong to refuse service to Israeli tourists solely due to their nationality.,"There was a video uploaded to r/PublicFreakout and various other subreddits purportedly showing a restaurant in Vietnam having a confrontation with an Israeli tourist. While I agree his behaviour in the video and the context behind it paints him as being a bad-faith actor, I was somewhat and disturbed by the sentiment shown in the comments.

A lot of people in Israel are against the continuation of the war. In fact, there have been constant protests against Netanyahu and his government for prioritising it over other means of freeing the hostages. It should go without saying that not all citizens supp kj
Itbzl
G  ort the actions of their government. This is true everywhere, whether in Russia, China, or any other dictatorship like Iran or Saudi Arabia. Many of which commit even worse human right abuses and are rightfully condemned. Would it be right to discriminate against a tourist from such a country? No, and even if they are in support of their government tons of tourists with objectionable views are served regularly without any problems.

If the tourist was the aggressor and had incited the confrontation it would be right to refuse service to him. But the comments heavily plied that it would be correct to refuse service to all Israelis. I cannot see this as anything other than discrimination based on nationality. It might not be racist as nationality aren’t races, but it would certainly be wrong. And when criticizing someone for their (geo)political beliefs, one should not extend their criticism to all members of a nationality or religion. “Fuck Israel” is often heard due to the actions of Netanyahu’s government, but “Fuck Gaza” is never said even though the comparably vile Hamas is in control of Gaza. To me both would be too blunt.

1dykazg,"CMV: It is completely reasonable for Europeans to be concerned about the influx of migrants from Islamic countries, given the laws and culture of these countries and the beliefs of many of their citizens","I live in the United States, so I'm no stranger to fights over border security. But while I understand concerns about the number of people entering the country and whether we have the resources and economy to give them what they need and also provide for our citizens, I've never understood the concern about the people entering. Mexico and the US are very similar in terms of values and attitudes, so while there may be a language barrier it's not as though illegal immigrants coming in from South America and Mexico are going to try to impose their own vastly different set of laws or rules on others or even believe that should happen. 

But when I look at Europe and the migrants entering Europe, that's completely different. Islam does have its own rules and laws and many citizens of these countries believe that these rules and laws were created by God and therefore they automatically transcend any legal system created by mere mortals. 

I'm not saying most Muslims feel this way. Islam has many different sects, with different views. But if even a small % of the migrants coming in- an unknown number I might add- believe that they have the right to impose their way of life on others because it's the word of their God, I completely understand why people would be concerned.

The window should be large enough for a large party to receive their food and have a reasonable amount of time to eat. Once they are past the cutoff, they cannot order anything other than more water.

1e11r9e,cmv: islam is the most political and furthest away religion from universal truth,"i think that all religions offer fragments of truth, that when pieced together eclectically and viewed figuratively, with an open mind can answer questions like where do we come from, why we're here etc. i know that all religions can serve political agendas but i feel like islam was specifically designed for that and it seems to be the furthest away from the same universal truth that each other religion tried to convey in its way, according to its historical and societal context.

islam positions itself as a correction to all these previous religions and harbors a historical and doctrinal insistence on its absolute truth and finality, which results in a heightened display of agression, defensiveness and self entitlement among many muslims. 

this manifests in a resistance to criticism and further insistence on the primacy of islam even when its principles clash with modern values or other people's beliefs (i noted that many muslims are not respectful towards other people's beliefs, and if they are it tends to be a feigned respect) 

in contrast, i feel like other religions tend to follow the same developmental trajectory and have a certain complementarity to them that allows for flexible interpretation. but islam's distinct approach resists such integration aiming instead to establish its supremacy.

this intrinsic defensiveness leads to intra-community conflicts, and muslims tend to monitor each other's behavior as well (im thinking of the 100 monkeys experiment) which brings me to my next point which is that islam incorporates values that can be seen as mechanisms of control. like the strong emphasis on obedience to parents (which we know can be harmful), the punitive measures for apostasy and blasphemy and the authority of religious leaders and scholars (literally every king of a muslim monarchy claims descendance from the prophet even when it doesn't make sense from an ethnical pov, im from a country like that and i can assure you that it works in maintaining the status quo) and their interpretations are accepted without question, stifling critical thinking and personal interpretation. 

i feel like islam encourages adherence through fear and hate. like i as a child, at school or at home i would get told a lot of scary stories to justify what should and shouldn't be done, and i always lived in anxiety bc i interpreted stuff literally, that was probably due to my autism. but i digress. 

anyways change my view.

1e12cl5,Cmv: Trumps visit to North Korea is overlooked to the point where it helps him gain support,"I don't like Trump at all but I can't deny that his visit to North Korea was a massive foreign policy win that has been criminally understated by the media and political crowd as a whole.

I see this as a similar act to JFK visiting the Berlin wall, or Nixon visiting China. I think it combines some aspects of both these events. Similarly to JFK visiting Berlin, it accomplished little on paper but had a substantial impact worldwide on a social and propaganda level. Many would argue that JFK's visit started/helped along the path to the fall of the Soviet Union and the US winning the cold war. Granted that didn't happen for another 30 years, but I don't think the goal of the North Korea visit was to immediately dissolve the state at that point either. It's similar to Nixons visit as it was a first for any president to enter north korea, and arguably the first real effort from both sides to talk things out. 

I think this also negates what a lot of Trumps critics said, especially before the election, which is that while he might be an experienced businessman, he would be useless at foreign policy. Not only did he set some groundwork for future negotiations with North Korea, Russia didn't try to pull anything during his term, and he didn't have any military blunders, unlike the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Furthermore South Korea largely applauded this action, which speaks volumes. And in researching some more about this topic, I read that some North Korean top brass might look down on Kim if he doesn't play ball with the US after these talks, which might have been part of Trump's plan all along. 

Quid pro quo deals are much more likely to be effective than what other presidents have done, by simply denouncing North Korea at every conceivable opportunity. It worked pretty well with the Soviet Union, and is a great compromise between doing nothing and a military invasion.

I think these lead into my second point, that the medias refusal to acknowledge some of Trump's genuine accomplishments simply feed the fire for people who want another excuse to support him. Now whether that would actually sway people one way or another is a debate in itself, but there is an undeniable double standard. 

The only arguments I see against my point is that 1. Trump has done a lot of bad that outweighs the good. I won't argue that point here, but I think my statement about the double standard from the media isn't helping. 

The other argument many have made is that Trump was the first to in some way legitimize the DPRK. I disagree, if that is the case then JFK and Nixon legitimized the USSR and China respectively too. The fact is that the DPRK does exist and as I stated above, the quid pro quo approach will be the most effective in the coming decades.

1e2aujx,"CMV: I think having women wear a hijab/Niqab/Burka/Etc is sexist, and people defending it for reasons other than religious is illogical","My main gripe with the subject is not over the religious aspect, but rather people defending it as one of ""them cultural things"" Just because something is a part of a culture it doesn't mean it gets a free pass to do anything or makes it right. Black slavery was part of the culture of the time, and it was not right, and I think we can all agree on that. This is something that silently bothers me so I would like to hear the other side to see if I can understand it. If it's religious I could understand it, even when I'm not religious myself, because from a religious person's perspective, it is the indisputable word of God and cannot be doubted.

The argument I see the most often is that some women choose to wear the hijab, I'm obviously not talking about these cases, please refrain from bringing this up. 

I find the idea that women should cover themselves in restrictive clothing in order to ""protect themselves from lewd gazes and abuse"" ridiculous and kinda like victim blaming, why is the victim forced to forfeit her liberties instead of the abuser learning to not...abuse. And yeah I understand the Quran is also sexist with men, but then again, it doesnt make it right.

""It helps control how sexualized women are, and keeps beauty standards down to earth"" Again, the victim shouldnt change for the abuser's sake, and if the natural standard is men so lustful they can't see a woman's hair, I prefer sexualizing women.

""It's like women being required to wear a bra"" It totally isn't. Women, at least currently, \*choose\* to wear a bra for comfort, and sometimes even to make their breasts look better. And wearing a bra is not mandatory.

""It's the same as having to cover your genitals in public"" No, there is a biological imperative, mating instincts, that makes us specially attracted to genitals, also our primary genitals are not only for reproducing but also for excreting, so it's also considered unhygienic. And it can be disruptive.

""You just think that way because of traditional western values"" Yes, yes I do. I don't agree with with everything in traditional western values, but generally I do, and that does not, in any way, affect the validity of an argument, I stand by what I believe because I see logic in it, not because the TV or my parents told me to. And it's why I'm eager to hear the logic in the counter-argument to update my own.

1e2hcyj,CMV: Most Highschoolers and College aged kids are virtue signaling when it comes to the Israel-Palestine conflict.,"Now I don't think supporting Palestinians is the wrong choice. But I think a lot of people have just jumped on the bandwagon and started yelling about it without ever knowing what they really are standing for. 

Most people chanting ""From the river to the sea"" or other phrases like this do not even know the meaning of what they are saying. Not to mention that these statements are usually inflammatory coming out of these people's mouths. People scream these at protests but refuse to acknowledge any other point of view as having a sliver of validity, because a different opinion just equals wrong here. All this does is create more hate between the two sides when both sides can't talk about it without being accused of any number of hateful words. If on average more people were tolerant of people with different views on this subject, and tried to educate, the divide in countries beside Israel/Palestine wouldn't be nearly so bad.

Most people on both sides also don't hope for the possibility of a cease-fire. They want the eradication of a state, one way or another. This has become a war of hate, both in those countries and in others.

Furthermore, the age demographic I am referring to has completely forgotten about the Russo-Ukrainian war. Months ago, it used to be all about saving Ukraine, and now I have not heard a single word about it out of anyone's mouths in months besides during presidential address'/ the debate. Keeping this trend, I would say it isn't out of the realm of possibility that they also abandon this Issue if/when something worse comes along.

1e5e06p,CMV: Standard sheet music is an unintuitive mess that has killed countless people's interest in learning music.,"As some background, I've been making music as a hobbyist for over 20 years in DAWs (mostly FL Studio).  A few weeks ago I began learning piano.  The instrument itself is wonderful.  I love the way it sounds.  I love that you can play chords with one hand and melodies with the other.  Practicing scales is fun.  Practicing chords is fun.

Learning to read sheet music is.... A total nightmare.  You shouldn't have to decipher the Rosetta Stone to figure out which note you're supposed to play, but this is what sheet music asks you to do.  Sheet music doesn't reflect the actual physical layout of a piano whatsoever.  They've decided to map the C Major scale (a 2-2-1-2-2-2-1 pattern) onto a series of alternating (1-1-1-1-1) lines and spaces, which is a totally baffling decision that leads to all sorts of insane notation difficulties.  We need to go through a ridiculous process to figure out what note a symbol on the staff is representing.  Is it a treble clef or a bass clef? OK, bass clef, so now I have to say All Cats Eat Grass... Oh wait, my mnemonic device doesn't extend three lines below the staff where this note is, so now I actually have to count the notes as I move down.  Oh wait, the key signature has four sharps, which is... checks Google... E Major.  Which means this note needs to be sharp.... It can legitimately take over a minute just to figure out what one single note is.  And that's not even getting into the ridiculous way that rhythm is notated, with measures of differing physical widths and all sorts of weird symbols to denote things that would've been obvious if you had just placed them on an equally spaced grid.

I genuinely think this miserable, arcane system has caused many otherwise potentially talented musicians to just give up.  And before you go saying ""Well they couldn't have been great musicians if they couldn't learn sheet music"", I heartily disagree.  Nothing about learning sheet music has anything to do with actual music... It's a terrible exercise in rote memorization and deciphering somebody's ridiculous secret code.

As for alternatives, I've tried reading two other systems that seem to be just completely superior to sheet music in every way.  The first is the hooktheory website.  Now this is a sensible way to notate music.  It gives you the key of the song (I don't need to memorize that four sharps means E Major).  The songs are notated in a piano-roll like format, where the notes are color-coded according to their position in the scale and note names are shown on the left side.  The chords are numbered and named below the melody, and also color coded.  Accidentals are shown on the lines between notes and color coded with stripes of the note above and below.

But even better than that is Klavarskribo.  This is a notation that just lays out the piano on the page.  White notes are shown as white.  Black notes are shown as black.  Measures are equally spaced out and you can just look at the spacing to know when to play things.  I legitimately was able to just start playing songs of any key, spanning all over the piano, no problem whatsoever, in Klavarskribo notation because it's just an intuitive format that matches the piano perfectly.  Weeks of sheet music study, 2 minutes of Klavarskribo study and I'm already better in the latter.  That speaks volumes.

So yeah, sheet music is a mess and there are better alternatives.  I think it's important because again, people are being pushed away from learning music by this awful system.  Things that won't change my view:

* ""I learned it! Many people have learned it! Therefore it's fine!"" No, just because you learned it doesn't mean it's a sensible system or that it hasn't turned many others away from music.  

* ""Well it's everywhere now so you'll just have to get used to it!"" Yeah I know, that's why I'm still learning it.  Doesn't mean it's not an unintuitive mess.  And it doesn't mean we shouldn't try to incorporate other alternatives, especially for beginners to learn.

The one argument I've heard that might make sense is the compactness of sheet music.  But I haven't actually seen any data showing how much more compact it is (or even if it is at all) than other systems.",KimonoThief,406,0.7699999809265137,290,1721208935,2024-07-17 04:35:35,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5e06p/cmv_standard_sheet_music_is_an_unintuitive_mess/,7,2024
1e5q70i,"CMV: Jack Black handled Kyle Gass' comment appropriately and it's silly to call anything regarding the events ""cancel culture"".","Quick context for anyone unaware: Tenacious D is the satirical duo of Jack Black and Kyle Gass.  Black is the more prominent of the members.  A few days ago, during a ""make a wish"" segment at a concert, Gass said his wish was something to the effect of ""that the shooter doesn't miss next time"".

Black went on to cancel the rest of the tour, also stating that future creative plans are now on hold.  Gass issued an apology - not a ""sorry if you were offended"" type, but an outright ""what I said was wrong"" kind.  He knew what he said was inexcusable.  

I do not understand peoples' reaction to this.

*""Oh, so now they're holding satirical comedians to a higher standard that political candidates!""*  Huh?  Who's ""they""?  Black is an outspoken liberal, so he's never been supportive of Trump and similar people.  He's holding his bandmate to the same standards he's held others to, including politicians.  

*""This must be that cancel culture that Republicans 'don't believe in'!""*  Again, huh?  Jack Black himself is the one who pulled the plug.  The promoter didn't cancel the tour.  The venues weren't canceling shows.  The leader of the freaking band made the decision.  

*""What a way to treat your friend.""*  Still confused here.

1e5u7gm,CMV: Trumps' intended economic policies will be hugely inflationary.,"A common refrain on the right is that Trump is some sort of inflation hawk, and that he is uniquely equipped to fix Biden's apparent mismanagement of the economy.

The salient parts of his policy plan ([Agenda47 ](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/reclaiming-americas-independence-by-slashing-bidens-disastrous-trade-deficits)and public comments he's made) are:

* implementation of some kind of universal tariff (10%?)
* implementation of selectively more aggressive tariffs on Chinese goods (to \~60% in some cases?)
* targeted reduction in trade with China specifically
* a [broader desire](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/trump-vance-us-dollar.html) to weaken the U.S. dollar to support U.S. exports
* a [mass program](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/trump-immigration-republicans-explained.html) of deportation
* at least maintaining individual tax cuts

Whether or not any of these things are important or necessary per se, all of them are inflationary:

* A universal tariff is effectively a 10% tax on imported goods. Whether or not those tariffs will be a boon do domestic industry isn't clear.
* Targeted Chinese tariffs are equally a tax, and eliminating trade with them means getting our stuff from somewhere else - almost certainly at a higher rate.
* His desire for a weaker dollar is just an attitudinal embracing of higher-than-normal inflation. As the article says, it isn't clear what his plans are - all we know is he wants a weak dollar. His posturing at independent agencies like the Fed might be a clue, but that's purely speculative.
* Mass deportation means loss of low-cost labor.
* Personal tax cuts are modestly inflationary.

All of the *together* seems to me to be a prescription for pretty significant inflation.

1e5v5gg,"CMV: Even if a fetus were considered a fully-fledged human, abortion should still be permitted for the mother without limitations according to United States law. ","To start: I am not looking for moral appeals here. “It kills the baby” “it’s wrong” “it’s mean” “you shouldn’t have gotten pregnant” are not arguments against my position. I am arguing within the legal theory of the United States, not within a moral framework for this argument. 

Assumptions: I grant for the sake of argument that an unborn fetus is a human being with all rights that should be accorded to natural born citizen. 

As an aside, in an extreme view of this position I would hold that once viability has been reached, the fetus should be eligible as a tax dependent, a co-rider for carpool lanes, and should have a social security number, etc. Please note that personally I do not feel that this is true, but for the sake of a stronger argument, I am allowing the pro-life side a stronger starting position: ie; granting the fetus full-personhood. 

Argument: The fetus is a human being who cannot survive without a birth. This human will die if they do not leave the womb through a medical procedure: ie, birth. 

This surgery is unique in that it requires a medical intervention on the body of the patient benefitting from the surgery (the fetus being born) but it also requires to consent and cooperation of a third party to be involved in and accept the dangers of the surgery: the mother who is giving birth. The fetus cannot be born, and thus cannot live, without being born by the mother, full-stop. The mother, on the other hand, can continue to live quite easily without going through the dangerous medical intervention that is childbirth. Her life is not endangered by the requirement to give birth, only that she is forced into a binary of doing something about the pregnancy, but abortion is significantly safer than a birth or Caesarean section, and in a purely pragmatic sense is the better option for her own health and wellbeing (assuming she does not want a child)

When taking this into account, the closest analogue I can think of would be a sickly sibling in need of a kidney. You are their only match. Without the kidney, your sibling will die, without question. And also without question, donating your kidney is dangerous, and poses a risk to yourself personally. 
But, while it may be morally wrong, or distasteful to not want to put yourself through the danger of that surgery to save your sibling, it is NOT MURDER TO NOT DONATE YOUR KIDNEY, EVEN IF THEY WILL DEFINITELY DIE WITHOUT IT. You choosing not to undergo a dangerous medical procedure that is unnecessary to your own personal medical wellbeing is not murder, even if that has the direct consequence of the death of another. It would insanity to force you to donate your kidney to a match, in the same way it should be insane to force a woman to give birth to a human. 

In fact, even if you had recently died, if you aren’t an organ donor, your rights to bodily autonomy, even as a corpse, trump your siblings need to violate your bodily autonomy in order to keep living. 

Even if all that was needed to save the person’s life was a single drop of your blood, you cannot be compelled to give it if I don’t want to. 

So why, when the rights of living, breathing, tax-paying, spouse-having, kidney-needing adult humans cannot supersede your abilities to make your own personal decisions regarding which medical procedures to engage in, should a fetus, even with the full rights of men, be able to do so?",cudakid210,369,0.6899999976158142,566,1721254769,2024-07-17 17:19:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e5v5gg/cmv_even_if_a_fetus_were_considered_a/,7,2024

A racial slur is a derogatory term used against members of a culture, nationality or ethnicity. The N-word is a derogatory term used against black people. Cracker is a derogatory term used against white people.

Why is it ok to use one, but not the other? Why because of the colour of my skin is it ok for someone to say haneous things to me and make me suffer through it without being able to call it out because ""you can't be racist to white people"" or some other unjust reason?

Racism is discrimination against members of a culture, nationality or ethnicity. If you discriminate against any culture, nationality or ethnicity then you are racist. It doesn't matter what country, ethnicity or community you belong to, it is racist to discriminate based on those factors. You can be racist to anyone.

One argument I have heard many times is that white people can't experience racism because they ""systemically oppress"" other ethnic groups. Ok. Here's a hypothetical:

Let's say that tomorrow we are all transported back to the time where we were cavemen. No society, not system, no government. Nothing.

If a white person calls an Asian person a slur, is that racist? Yes it is because that falls under the definition of discrimination.

If an Asian person calls a white person a slur, is that racist? Yes it is because that also falls under the definition of discrimination. There is no ""systemic oppression"" excuse now. It's the stone age. No society, nothing like that. Just basic human emotions and conflicts.

It is racist to call a white person a slur the same way it is racist to call a black, Asian, Latino, etc. person a slur. And yet white people are forced to endure being called these things and not being able to call out the unfair and unjust treatment we are subject to.

I am so sick and tired of seeing the media pushing this false narrative that it's ok to hate white people. But if a white person said it's ok to hate any other race, they would be harassed to no end. It is really demoralising to see how we've just thrown basic human nature and common sense out of the window because it's a competition of who suffers more.",Calseeyummm,487,0.6899999976158142,989,1721551957,2024-07-21 03:52:37,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e8hzgg/cmv_you_can_be_racist_to_white_people/,7,2024

1. Leadership: husbands are expected to (gently) domineer day-to-day life. As the head of household (according to traditional gender roles), a husband should have the final say in all matters, and every tradwife I’ve seen on social media is more than willing relinquish control and acquiesce to a strong husband’s will.

2. Protection: husbands are expected to handle all threats to tradwives/family units, be it physical, emotional, or financial. Tradwives want a “fixer” - a man who will face all problems head on, shielding them from hardship in all forms.

3. Aesthetics: from what I’ve seen (willing to change my mind here), tradwives want a conventionally “masculine” man who looks the part. A man who LOOKS like they could handle points 1 and 2. Tall, big hands, muscular frame etc.

I know that dom/sub relationships don’t necessarily conform to traditional gender roles. But from what I’ve seen on social media, tradwives just want a burly, strong man to protect them from external danger/obligations/responsibilities. Change my view!

1. Almost all of her merch says Kamala. Clearly that's how she wants to be referenced.

In my opinion, sexism plays zero role in people referring to her as Kamala instead of Harris.

If Joe Biden were to pass away, Vice President Harris would immediately replace him right now. If Joe Biden were to pass away 10 seconds after the election was certified, the Vice President, who at this point, Joe Biden has intended to be Kamala Harris, would replace him. If Joe Biden were not the incumbent, and Kamala Harris was not already the Vice Presidential candidate, there would be an argument because there would be no clear line of succession, but there is in this case.

2. It's fine to not want to be associated with another movement you don't fully agree with. Some supporters of Palestine go fairly extreme with outrigt supporting Hamas or spreading outright antisemitism. Its fair for anyone to not want their flag flying alongside another flag they may disagree with itself, or disagree with elements of.

3. It's fine to want pride marches and events to actually focus on Pride. Attaching other social causes to all of them just kinda dilutes the message and energy.

1edgou8,CMV: Helicopter Parenting needs to die,"I recently saw a stat that 20-25 percent of Gen Zers have brought their parents to a job interview. If true, I don't understand how any parent could possibly think involvement to that level within an adult child could possibly help them land a job. Honestly, you're just doing your child a disservice as we all have to eventually learn how to survive on our own. Kids also need to learn how to fail as that is a learning opportunity as well.

To clarify, I'm not talking about 17-year olds getting their first job, but their first after-college ""real job"".

I'm a Millennial and I encountered some of this in college as well. I was always flabbergasted that parents of students would bug professors about their kid's grade or call campus safety to bitch about their kid's dorm room being too cold or too hot. I told my parents that this was happening at the time and they were both mortified. They wouldn't have interfered to this level and I wouldn't have wanted them to.

The goal of raising kids is to create humans that can stand on their own without this sort of ""help"" from mommy and daddy. I'm totally understanding when it comes to letting adult children live with you - the housing market sucks and rent is astronomically expensive (but that's a whole other issue). However, the type of parental involvement is a serious problem in my view.

Helicopter parenting is a failed parental methodology that needs to die a quick and painful death.

That’s just family right? We learn to live with it. But when Trump’s permanently-grumpy running mate called childless women “cat ladies” , I thought: this type of behaviour needs to stop.

I don’t have anything against having children. If that’s part of your journey in life, then I wish you well. Maybe it brings you immense fulfillment in life, and if so, I’m happy for you.

However, in my personal observation, many more people are less happy than when they were childless. And many more people regret having children than not having children.

So a lot of people, especially my age, are realizing that beyond economic limitations, we just aren’t interested in having children because we’d be less happy if we did. I, for one, would much rather be hiking or biking on my own than changing diapers or watching little league games.

And I don’t see anything wrong with doing what maximizes my happiness if it doesn’t harm anyone else.

So if you’re someone who thinks there’s something so unethical or immoral about this opinion or lifestyle that people should be called “cat ladies” for having them, I’m happy to discuss.",honeyetsweet,543,0.6299999952316284,1043,1722107740,2024-07-27 14:15:40,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1edo50c/cmv_stigma_against_the_childless_needs_to_end/,7,2024
1eem5bf,CMV: Voting should be mandatory and America should adopt the Australian voting model,"My view is thus, America should duplicate the Australian model for voting, which includes the following points.

- Election Day should be a federal holiday or moved to a Saturday.

- Failing to cast a ballot, even a blank ballot should result in a fine. This fine can be gotten out of with demonstrating a good reason you could not vote.

- Employers should be required to give anyone working on Election Day a reasonable amount of time off to vote. 

- Optional, but a part of the system that we should copy, even if not mandated by regulation or law. Fundraisers selling sausages at polling places, colloquial called “democracy sausages” a beloved part of the Australian voting culture.

It seems almost criminal to me that it’s not the norm for everyone in the world’s “bastion of democracy” to vote, and that it’s considered a point of concern to query and possibly fine everyone who didn’t cast a ballot.

My central view is that voting should be mandatory, the exact method by which we do this is not important to me, I was merely offering the Australian model as an option. I welcome being convinced why mandatory voting is a bad thing.

Supreme court reform is Obviously needed, and one common suggestion on how to do that is to pack the court. The concept is quite simple, with a larger court, a small biased minority will have a harder time influencing rulings, among other benefits.

There are issues with this however, the first being why and how the packing would begin. The most common suggestion for expanding the court is for Biden or Harris once she steps up (Assuming she wins) expanding the court to 13 justices, one for each circuit. The implication of course being that all five of the new judges would be young and liberal. This will cause issues down the line however, since republicans will be watching closely. The republicans will likely win at least one of the next 3-4 presidential elections, and when they do they'll be nothing to stop them from packing the court again, say to 17. Then Dems win again, and bump it up to 21. You see where this leads, the court will start ballooning, and justices will be blatantly political. With so many positions opening up, prospective justices may start all but campaigning  for them, hoping to be selected by party leadership on either side.

1eh4u8e,"CMV: The word ""weird"" is going to destroy Trump's campaign","For those who haven't been following the election and the memes, basically the Democrats, mainstream media, and social media are attacking Trump's campaign by calling Trump / Vance and their supporters ""weird."" It's a similar tactic that Trump has used (i.e. Low Energy Jeb, Lyin Ted, Crooked Hillary, etc.). While this might sound like silly playground tactics, we've seen how well this works if the label actually sticks.

Well in this case, ""weird"" has really struck a nerve with the right wing and it's really sticking. The right wing Trump supporters have been getting really mad and angry about being called weird, like it's very tangible that it gets under their skin. Even Trump himself is not handling it very well.

In my opinion, there's 2 reasons why the word ""weird"" is making them so mad

(1) Because, let's be honest, it's true. Trump and his supporters are weird. The whole world outside of the US thinks they are weird. People in the US who aren't part of the core MAGA fanbase thinks these people are weird. Trump himself is weird. 

(2) Conservatives hate the idea of not being normal. This label doesn't work against progressives, because progressives generally embrace people who don't fit into traditional social norms. Conservatives are all about following traditional social norms, so when people start to call out that Trump and the MAGA core are abnormal oddballs, it really hits their ego.

Ok so why is this attack going to destroy Trump's campaign? Because nobody wants to sit at the lunch table with the social outcasts. Obviously the die hard Trump voters are going to vote for Trump no matter what, but basically the election is now framed as Kamala being the option for normal people and Trump being the choice for weirdos. Obviously this is whole thing is very silly and you could argue it's just name calling, but if I'm being honest, it's about time the Democrats started getting mean with their election strategies. I also think Trump and his supporters have acted like bullies for the last 8 years, so it's pretty satisfying to give them a taste of their own medicine.

1ehibx3,"CMV: If you don’t even vote in your local elections, then you have no right to bitch and moan about national/global politics.","I will never comprehend the egregious levels of self-important cuntiness it takes for people (especially on this platform, but elsewhere too) to make political ideology the largest facet of their personality, while taking absolutely zero action within their own sphere of influence.

You are not important enough nor are you educated enough for your perspective on geopolitics / macroeconomics to matter one fucking bit. Don’t flatter yourself. You care so much about these things because you lack a sense of control in your personal life, and pontificating about things much larger than you is simply a mechanism for escapism. Herein lies the truth of your mental illness masquerading as virtue and competence.

You chose to focus on large-scale issues for several reasons. First, the more wide-reaching the scope, the more morally superior you get to feel about yourself for caring about it. More accurately, being *seen* to care about it. To that end, national/global issues have a larger community surrounding them, which is a necessity for placating your narcissism. How else would everyone else know how wonderful of a person you are? And, the biggest reason of all:

You only care about large issues because you know that you have, and will always have, exactly zero impact on the outcome. As long as that’s true, you can skirt any sense of responsibility when it comes to making a difference. You get to have all the emotional feel-goods of being part of a cause, without ever having to contribute any effort. You avoid smaller-scale issues because you could actually do something about them. This would create a sense of responsibility that spoils any and all appeal. Since you have no ability to impact the outcome of far-reaching policies, your opinions and ideas have no need to be based in reality either, since they’ll never be tried. Your ideas don’t have to actually make any sense or have any chance in hell or working. All they have to do is come with some sort of virtuous vibe to get you the sense of moral superiority you crave.

For the vast majority of people (99.999%) your ideas are not novel. In fact, someone more powerful than you probably told you what to think, so you’re not a free-thinking genius either just because you hold some radical, contrarian opinion.

This is not to say that you are not allowed to have opinions on national / global issues. You absolutely can. What you cannot do though, is paint yourself as this bastion of human decency, focusing only on abstract bullshit you have no control over, all the while ignoring the parts of our flawed society that you can influence.

At the end of the day, it does not matter one fucking bit to the average person who is president. Your personal life will be impacted much more directly by the mayor of your town, your county’s board members, and the president of your local school board.

Pedophiles are a group of individuals who are adults or older adolescent that experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.

This misapplication not only misrepresents the nature of these relationships but also dilutes the gravity of actual pedophilia, potentially undermining efforts to protect children from sexual abuse.

The age gap police need to calm down. It's understandable to want to protect younger partners from being taken advantage of, but labeling someone a predator just because their relationship doesn't fit your narrow view of what an age gap should be is unreasonable. This kind of reaction is excessive and unfair.

Two people of the same age can be at different stages of life due to various factors such as career paths, educational pursuits, personal choices, and life experiences.

1ehpzqp,CMV: The way some popular Anime/Manga sexualize women and children is wrong,"Let me be preface this by saying, I love anime. I'm a big proponent of manga and I have read hundreds of completed works. I love the grittiness and emotional complexity that these works can express. Some mangaka are so incredibly talented that every panel they produce is a masterpiece. I don't want anyone to think that I'm coming from a place of ""anti-anime"" because that is not true. I'm making an observation and want an outsider's perspective.

Now that I've made that clear, the crux of today's cmv, sex. For as long as I can remember, sexually explicit material has been synonymous with anime. Big Booba and pornographic material is so prevalent in Japan that many famous mangaka have at one point previously worked as Hentai artists. It seems almost like a right of passage for artists to draw explicit stuff. Anime like, ""Rent a Girlfriend"" or ""My First Girlfriend is a Gal"" are literally just Hentai plots without the sex. Now, that wouldn't inherently be an issue as I am a proponent for sex positivity and sexually explicit material... BUT... the sheer amount of large breasted sexualized women and middle/high school girls is questionable at worst, and abhorrent at best. 

Let's break this down into a couple of digestible points to help make my argument clear.

* Sexualizing Minors is Wrong

As mentioned above, the act of making middle/highschool kids sexually appealing by altering their appearance through large breasts, school uniforms, swimsuits or the like, is just pedophilic. There are plenty of average looking kids in anime that aren't overtly sexualized, but when you see it, you know it. It's not even uncommon to allow these types of physical ""youthful"" appearances to transcend into fantasy canon. ""It's ok for her to be a loli because she's 700 years old."" or ""she isn't actually young, she just LOOKS young"" are common arguments to defend the act of sexualizing characters with the physical appearance of a minor. If you've been on TikTok you might have seen the popular title, ""If my Wife becomes an Elementary School Student"".... this is just a story device to allow the main character to form an intimate connection with a child. Inversely some characters have the body of an adult, but the mental capacity of a child. Llulu and Kanna from ""Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid"" are both excellent examples of almost ALL of these super problematic tropes. Llulu with her loli body, giant breasts, and childlike brain and Kanna with her physical appearance allowing an overtly inappropriate relationship with Riko (who is a child). Let's not forget the fact that Lucoa is canonically a PREDATOR, who is taking care of a child called Shouta... need I say more? It's almost like the show want's you to support groomers. All of these tropes are common place and popular in the current anime landscape.

* Women are inaccurately portrayed

The amount of large breasted ""skinny thicc"" women in anime is staggering. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that we should be leaning heavily in the opposite direction either. I see alot of left leaning people who like to ""fix"" art by adding weight or fixing proportions, and I don't think this is necessarily the correct approach to these issues. Obviously in an Anime setting where everyone works for a secret government organization and have super soldier serum running through their veins, then yeah, they're gonna be ripped. But why does every single person have the exact same body type? Look at Fairy Tail for example, every single main female protagonist is a skinny thicc, massive booba, revealing bikini type character. It's completely fine to have sexual material in moderation, but to have every single female character be subjected to the ""my eyes are up here"" treatment makes them feel cheap and not well written. Not only that, but the characters (lets use One Piece as an example) usually lean towards the male gaze. The main male protagonists (that aren't obviously weird AF) all have rippling muscles and powerful tools to engage with the enemies, even Usopp post time skip is shredded! But the main female characters like Nami are just skinny, big booba, low impact side characters who don't have their time in the spotlight outside of being saved by Luffy. 

There are so many posts in r/badwomensanatomy with anime girls as the subject you'd think they should rebrand it to r/dorealwomenliveinJapan?

* Saturation and Media

Let's be real here for a second. Most of the women in ""Fairy Tail"" and ""One Piece"" (to name a few) have a pornstar body. There's plenty of anime that I start watching where I feel strongly that there won't be any major sex appeal, and then two seconds later we get hit with an unnecessary amount of cleavage. Demon Slayer, one of my favorite animes in recent years, gave Nezuko (14 yrs old) massive tits, as well as Mitsuri and Daki (Daki makes more sense because shes a prostitute but honestly, her outfit was 100% just for sex appeal not historical accuracy to what prostitutes wore during that era). Fire Force had senseless amounts of fan service to the point where they wrote it into the plot as a character flaw so that they could do it more often.

It's not the fact that these character archetypes exist, but that they find their way into EVERY anime. Why does every popular anime in recent years require women to have pornstar bodies? Anime isn't just some small thing in Japan, it's everywhere over there. It's a cultural staple to watch and digest anime. How do you think young girls/women feel about their own bodies when every female character looks like a pornstar? It's no wonder that the rate of plastic surgery in Japan has skyrocketed in recent years. Japan has the 3rd most plastic surgeries in the world while less than half the population of the U.S. The same thing can be seen in Korea due to influences such as Manwha and K-Pop stars. There's obviously a market for it, but that doesn't mean it's right.

There's so much toxicity in anime because it degrades women/children into sexual objects.

1ej4fvu,CMV: China peaked in 2019 and it is all downhill from here.,"There are so many crash circles happening in China. One really important thing to remember is that in 1990, almost 95% of the land in China was owned by the provinces. For 35 years now, the provinces have provided almost all social services and infrastructure projects by selling off land to developers. Now that developers are bankrupt and not buying land anymore, the provinces have no real income. They have no system set up to bring in taxes like a normal regional or state gov't can do... and as they do find ways to tax residents directly, that is putting pressure on consumer spending.

The other real death cycle is the number of middle class people who are paying a mortgage for a home that was never finished. You have a huge amount of people being forced to pay a mortgage and rent at the same time. In some cases it is even worse because the people got multiple mortgages thinking they could rent out their other homes. Having to pay double housing costs means people have far less money to spend in the economy on other things. Which leads to deflation.

Deflation is bad, even inflation under 2% is bad, because it means if you are a consumer, there is no reason for you to buy items today, because you know that in a month the item will be the same price or cheaper. This is why the USA and most EU countries have an inflation goal of 2%. It is low enough that it doesn't really hurt anyone, but it is high enough that it encourages consumer purchases. This keeps the economy churning. Deflation is also terrible for businesses, especially retail items like food, because if you buy an item for your store today, it might sit in your store for a month and have a lower price when you can actually sell it. This is crushing for low-margin businesses like supermarkets and retail stores.

This is all terrible, but equally bad is the covert ' decoupling ' by western companies, which have similar effects on the economy, and the current President Xi Jinping is doing all the wrong moves to save the economy. It's now even more censorsious, and even more authoritarian. 

Youth unemployment is nearly 40 percent, and number of desperate homeless people litter in every street. China's economic miracle is over and it'd be lucky if it can even be in Japan's lost decades, because at the rate things are going, it's going to turn into North Korea's lost decade. 

TLDR: China peaked in 2019 and it is all downhill from here.",asianlovewhite,523,0.7400000095367432,344,1722694744,2024-08-03 09:19:04,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ej4fvu/cmv_china_peaked_in_2019_and_it_is_all_downhill/,8,2024
1ej4z31,CMV: Men and women can have friendships that are purely platonic.,"(I'm not sure if NSFW is really needed here, but I do think this is sort of an adult issue).

Ok, this debate has been had online over and over, and I just saw another instance of it today. It blows my mind that people seem to think men and women cannot have platonic relationships. I personally am friends with multiple women in a purely platonic way. Several of them have gotten married in the last few years, and I've attended at least three of their weddings on my own, and a couple more with my wife. My wife did not know any of these women before dating me, and she has expressed zero concern over me maintaining these friendships. 

I'm not a kid - I understand that men and women usually aren't close enough to be called ""friends"" unless there's some level of attraction going on, and it can be anxiety-inducing for women especially, if their man hangs out one on one with other women. I'll say this to clarify: I avoid putting myself in situations where I'm by myself with another woman other than my wife, as I think there's something to be said about being respectful, both of my wife and of other women. I wouldn't want to put someone in a situation where there's an implicit suggestiveness, even if I know I would never act on anything.

So basically what I'm saying is: I think platonic relationships are good and healthy, but those platonic relationships should come with boundaries. One of those boundaries is a self-imposed rule to not hangout with a woman one on one in an environment that isn't public. I'm fine with the idea of grabbing breakfast with a woman other than my wife, as long as my wife is fine with it. Any hint of not being fine with that, even if not stated explicitly, and I absolutely would respect that. I think there's stricter rules you can impose when your wife is pregnant or was just recently pregnant, as that's obviously a vulnerable period of time when we know that men sometimes cheat.

The other aspect that I'll mention about this topic is that I believe it doesn't matter whether you're a man or a woman - most people choose all of their friends, regardless of sex, based on some level of admiration. So when people say men can't have platonic friendships with women, I think what they really mean is that there isn't zero attraction involved. And I think that's probably true if you think deeply about peoples' feelings. But I also think that's not really any different than how I choose my guy friends. I like hanging out with dudes who are talented, skilled, smart, kind, have clout, etc. I don't like being friends with guys who aren't bringing something to the table. But I'm as straight as can be and never had any sexual interest with my guy friends. For my women friends, the traits that lead to platonic friendship definitely overlap the traits that I see in my wife, but that doesn't mean my wife is replaceable by platonic friends. That's a totally different thing.

I wouldn't have married my wife if that weren't the case. Replacing your wife by another woman only makes sense if you see women as physical objects rather than as people, which is terrible in and of itself. I don't view my wife that way.

Also, I will say that I think it's good that if people think men can't have platonic friendships with women, they aren't friends with women. Different people have different boundaries and levels of self control. Some people are by nature very sexual, and it might be harder to control themselves in the presence of attractive women who aren't their SO. So anyone who recognizes that in themselves, great. I just think it definitely IS possible to have platonic relationships with the opposite sex (if you're straight), and I have a lot of evidence in my life proving that.",GenerativeAdversary,428,0.7799999713897705,263,1722696188,2024-08-03 09:43:08,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ej4z31/cmv_men_and_women_can_have_friendships_that_are/,8,2024
1ejeap5,CMV: American Politics Alienate Moderates,"I live in a swing state so maybe this issue isn't relatable to non-swing states. I consider myself politicly moderate and the I have never felt more alienated. Political ideologies between democrat and republican are more polarizing than ever, and if I make the mistake of speaking of anything remotely political during an election year to someone who affiliates themselves with either party as soon as I express a viewpoint that is contrary to theirs's they act like I may as well be burning down the capitol. Most political ads focus on tearing down their opposition instead of their plans or policies. I know some of this is a result of first past the post voting, and it's a combination of this and the electoral college that makes my vote and viewpoint in politics feel alienated. I also can empathize with the fact that being blue or red in a non-swing state that is the opposite color can make voting feel even more pointless. I believe in democracy, but I feel like the nature of politics is driving a wedge between people that's hurting us as a whole.

I know a lot of this is subjective... but I really do want this viewpoint of mine to change and this seems to be the place on reddit for that.

1em1vh4,CMV: There is no good solution to the birth rate problem,"Every single nation that reaches a certain standard of living experiences a drop in fertility rate below the replacement rate (2.1 children per woman). This is a good thing because it stems from increased education, healthcare, and access to contraceptives for women. Most rich countries have been maintained population stability/growth through immigration, but countries like Japan and South are unfortunately headed for a slow decline and demise. Immigration isn’t a long term solution to this problem though, since the entire world’s fertility rate is projected to drop below 2.1 by the end of the century, and there will be very few countries left with fertility rates above 2.1. 

Eventually the world economy will go the way of Japan and South Korea, and there’s really no good solution that can prevent this. People simply don’t want to have more than 2 kids once they are rich enough to decide that for themselves, no kinds of monetary incentives or generous parental leave policies have succeeded at reviving fertility rates to replacement level. Not to mention the fact that every two unmarried people would need to be “balanced” by a couple having 5 children.",Suitable_Ad_6455,474,0.8100000023841858,902,1723001919,2024-08-06 22:38:39,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1em1vh4/cmv_there_is_no_good_solution_to_the_birth_rate/,8,2024
1emk4vd,"CMV: Saying ""Tax the rich"" and then discussing income tax is a misinformative bait and switch.","As far as I know there is not a single person who became a billionaire primarily through income. Every billionaire became a billionaire by buying or inheriting some asset (property, land, stock, etc.) that increased in value to a billion+ dollars. 

I suspect this is also true for the majority of millionaires, saving up a million dollars through income is doable, but there are loads of people who just bought homes in CA or in big cities in the 70s and are now millionaires through housing inflation. 

Also this is tangential to my main view, but I think someone who made a million in income has 'earned' their wealth way more than someone who just got into an asset market at the right time or is snowballing generational family wealth. 

I understand that there are practical problems with taxing asset wealth

* Evaluating how much an asset is worth isn't easy. 
* Taxing someone based on their asset might force them to sell the asset, which might drive its value down and create a lot of other problems.
* People with a lot of asset wealth would probably just move somewhere else to avoid the taxes. 

(I also think [land value taxes](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty) solve a lot of these problems in an elegant way.) 

However instead of discussing any of this, what I see a lot of people in political discussions do instead is just fall back on income taxes as if they're a real way of combating wealth inequality. When I see politicians go ""We need to address wealth inequality, here's my proposal to increase income taxes on people making over <X> a year"" it just feels like a sleazy way to give the appearance of doing something to people who are angry about wealth inequality but don't know much about it. Maybe this is overly cynical but at best it seems like a way for old money to keep out new money. 

IMO any discussion about wealth inequality should focus on how to practically implement wealth taxes, or on ways to limit asset bubbles/speculation cycles that come about from QE / increasing money supply. Discussing income taxes seems like a total red herring.",aahdin,1319,0.8799999952316284,517,1723056979,2024-08-07 13:56:19,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1emk4vd/cmv_saying_tax_the_rich_and_then_discussing/,8,2024
1enf4mh,CMV: Kamala's shutdown of hecklers at her Detroit rally can't reasonably be interpreted as a stance on Palestine,"The timeline as I understand it: 

* Kamala met with the protest group and talked to them prior to the speech.
* The protesters get rowdy and disruptive during the speech and Kamala reminds them that, while they have a voice, it's her time to speak.
* They persist and she shuts them down more harshly
* People who didn't think it through, didn't know the context, or just don't care make a big deal out of it and try to shame her and everyone else as being ""pro genocide"" as if those were related.

So basically, I want to know what possible perspective or information I missed that makes this wrong. There certainly seem to be a lot of people (bots?) who are just going nuts over this issue turning all their frustration and hostility about the middle east against Kamala and anyone who points out that this was about interruptions, not anything else.

What would change my view - information that changes the context of what happened, some other reasoning that what she said could reasonably be interpreted the way some people are taking it.

I also believe she'll carry Democrats over the finish line in both the Senate and the House. The reason I say this is similar to the 2016 election is because this election comes at a time of uncertainty. Trump represents what Clinton represented in 2016. A product of a political system that most Americans think needs washing. Harris now is what Trump was in 2016.

This is in regards to anyone on a subway or bus who is playing their music out loud on full volume. Why would you think this is acceptable?

You're now forcing other people to listen to whatever music you want. In my experience, it's too loud for me to enjoy what I'm listening to because it's competing with both you and the noise of traffic.

If everyone did what you're doing, there would be a cacophony of noise that no one could enjoy. If you're doing something for your own benefit, but can only do it because no one else is doing it, isn't that being self-centered?

What possible excuse can there be for this sort of behavior?

1er6clk,CMV: The USA are a Plutocracy (a form of Oligarchy),"To demonstrate my point, I will start first by underlining the undemocratic nature of the US. 

First of all, in any democracy as it is defined each person’s vote must be equal to any other.
This is false for the US for several reasons:

## a) The electoral college system: 

39.5 million Californians translate to 55 electoral votes, while a combined total of 20 other states with the same population translate to 102 electoral votes. 

As it is clear, the vote of a Californian person has less intrinsic value than that of any other state in those 20. 

Furthermore, if say Republicans win in a certain state even by just 51%, they get ALL the electoral votes, meaning the other 49% amounts to a grand total of 0 political power. This is entirely and irrefutably undemocratic.

## b) The two party system:

This system, by itself, is undemocratic.

In an ideal democracy, all citizen with democratic beliefs should be represented. 

While this tends to be false even for multi-party systems, in those systems the large majority of people is represented in their ideas by a combination of parties: someone who is conservative in terms of immigration but progressive in terms of climate change might not be represented entirely by a single party but their beliefs are in fact represented. 

This of course doesn’t happen in the US. 

There’s no representation for socialized healthcare.

No representation for a ban on weapon carrying with. 

No representation for an electoral system change or for a constitutional revision.

And I could go on.

## c) The nationalistic zeal: 

USA are nationalistic. I think we can all agree with that. What that translates to, is a significant trend of passing the blame to outside forces, alongside the rivaling party. This is particularly in the case Donald Trump’s way of politics.

“The economy isn’t working? It’s because our allies are trading with china (and it’s the other party’s fault)”
 
“Covid struck too hard? It’s because of our border policies (and it’s the other party’s fault”

“We lost the election? Well Russia must have had something to do with it, with the other party’s approval” 

What this really means for a democratic society is the lack of self criticism and self improvement, at least at the federal level. Despite all the debates online and in court about what party supports what policies, the actual reality is much more “conservative” in regards to changes and reforms.

Regardless of who wins, it’s unlikely that truly deep reforms will get passed. However this is only a recent trend, and only true in terms of domestic policies. The true changes will be seen in terms of international politics, but that’s off topic for this discussion.

## d) Money talks:

Lobbying is legal in the US. Let that sink in. 

In terms of domestic policies (although this reflects in international policies as well), politicians are very much encouraged to accept financial support from national and multi-national level corporations, in exchange for support.

What this means is: you are not getting what you voted for. 

The Military industrial complex will still receive support.

Pharmaceutical companies will still be allowed astronomical prices for otherwise cheap medications.

X, Meta, Google and other tech companies will still be able to sell illegally retrieved customer data.

No. Matter. Who. You. Vote.

So, to recap, the USA are

1) a democracy only in name
2) nationalistic and stagnant
3) sheltering powerful companies

There’s a name for a form of government with those characteristic a *Plutocracy*.

No taxes on tips means lower Social Security earnings, which will reduce benefit payments when workers retire. 

I don't see a benefit to this proposal bc restaurant workers are often in the lowest tax brackets, so their taxes are usually minimal and their taxable earnings are often reduced to under $20,000 and offset by things like the earned income credit and child tax credits.  

While a few extra in tax savings seems like a great idea, in the long-run it is bad bc of reduced payroll tax receipts and reduced Social Security benefits for restaurant workers.  Please CMV.

1erlpti,"CMV: A lot of incels have standards for a partner that are not in-line with their own value. They could date people, they just don't want to date the people that they could reasonably attract. ","My post is going to focus specifically on male incels FYI. 

So if there's a man out there that in general women would perceive as low value on the dating market, I do believe that they're generally not going to be able to attract a partner that is higher value than them. 

However, there are also women that are perceived as low value by men and many of these women would like to have a long-term partner, potentially get married, have kids, etc. 

Who do incels think these women are marrying if not men that are equally perceived as low value on the dating market? 

I think a common thought amongst incels is that these low value women are able to date ""out of their league"" because higher value men are most willing to do that. I think that's probably true but I think that most of the time those relationships are short-term in nature which leads me back to my original question, who are these women marrying? They're marrying other people that are of a similar value or slightly higher as them.

What is preventing incels from just lowering their standards? Lower them, give it a try, if you don't have any success then guess what your standards are probably still too high. 

If I have a car that I want to sell for $X amount and I attract no potential buyers then I'm not involuntary unable to sell my car, my expectations are just not in-line with the reality of the market. 

I think it's pretty certain that a lot of incels would have to lower their standards to such a point where they would no longer be interested in dating the people they could reasonably attract. However, does that make you involuntary celibate? That sounds voluntary to me because you would be making the choice that you are not interested in dating the people that it's possible for you to date. 

TLDR: Incels need to lower their standards. There are plenty of women out there that are also perceived as low value out there that are looking for long-term relationships and they generally will end up with a partner of a similar value to many incels.

1et0lpa,"CMV: most criticism of ""incels"" is useless/unproductive because it relies too heavily on a just world fallacy. ","To start off. When I say ""Incel"" I mean the dictionary definition ""involuntary celibate"" somebody who wants a sexual relationship but for whatever reason is struggling or incapable of finding one. 

And the fact that I have to place a clear definition here is part of my view. Most of the conversations I see regarding incels turn into semantic arguments because people have a very specific stereotype in mind of a ""misogynistic overweight neckbeard who doesn't bathe and hates women because they don't want to sleep with him"" 

This I feel relies too heavily on a just world fallacy that dictates that these people must inherently be struggling due to personal/moral failings. Because if they weren't misogynistic/unhygienic/antisocial they wouldn't be having difficulties. 

I feel as though the world is not so just. And that there is a silent majority of incels who are struggling to find partners due to issues like neurodivergence and unhealthy or unrealistic standards placed on men (aka, toxic masculinity) in the realm of dating. 

As such, the advice most frequently given to this group to ""shower more"" and ""treat women like people"" is redundant and not at all helpful. Because it comes from a place of presumption based in the aforementioned just world fallacy.

1eugkeu,"CMV: ""States' Rights"" has never been an argument for freedom; instead, it has been used to oppress people.","##The Founding.  


In the US, the phrase ""states' rights"" has been used at times to call for a limitation on the power of the federal government. For those outside the US, our government is comprised of ""states"" which are supposed to be sovereign entities united under a ""federal"" government.  

In theory, this distinction was supposed to ensure that each U.S. state could operate as its own territory with its own government. The ""federal"" government was envisioned as some kind of entity which could both serve to unite the states and protect them on a more continental or global scale, and to bind them together locally so that each US state could consider its neighbors as allies and fellow citizens of some kind. 

This has, of course, *always* been a messy, imprecise concept. From the very beginning, the framers and anyone knowledgeable about governments disagreed on what the roles of these entities was supposed to be. We started, of course, with a failed concept known as ""The Articles of Confederation"" which was supposed to serve the same role as above but was entirely too weak to accomplish anything at all. The framers of the US constitution, it turned out, realized that any government entity **needed** to have enough power to actually assert its will over the people and territories, otherwise it simply couldn't. 

So the Articles of Confederation were a failure. It was an attempt to ensure the sovereignty of the states by limiting the power of a federal government, but that limitation proved to be its demise as absolutely nothing of meaning could be accomplished, rendering the system pointless.

##States' Rights and Slavery.  


So the state delegates got together to change them, but instead scrapped them entirely and wrote the US Constituion. This established the current United States of America. Among the debates and disagreements at that time was the issue of slavery. And what did they do? They ""compromised"" in the spirit of ""states' rights."" 

It was argued that the southern states had ""a right"" to practice slavery if those in control of those state governments wanted to do so. And those in charge of those state govenments were white slaveowning men. So of course, *they* decided what their ""states' rights"" were to be. 

#The concept of ""States' Rights"" has never been used - nor has it ever been needed - to expand human rights; instead, it has been used primarily to divide humanity and oppress marginalized groups.  

##States' Rights and Abortion.  


The phrase has been used in countless political debates, but few as conspicuously as the question of slavery. Most recently, it has been used on the question of abortions. 

 *Roe v Wade* was a Supreme Court case decided in 1973 which established that a person has an inherent right to privacy in their medical treatment to Due Process under the 14th Amendment. In general, this is the case which prevented US states from passing laws that restricted abortion. 

Come to *Dobbs v Women's Health*, the 2022 Supreme Court decision, and *Roe* is completely overturned. And on what basis? In large part, that the question of abortion *should be decided by the states.* This notion of ""states' rights"" was in the majority opinion, it was in the oral arguments, and it was flung around by media pundits and repeated by the casual conservatives celebrating the decision. 

***""States' Rights.""***

But what interest does ""a state"" have to ""rights?"" A state is nothing more than an abstract entity comprised of people making decisions ""as a state."" Why should ""a state"" have more authority to make decisions than a ""federal government?"" Why is that intrinsically more just than either a federal government or an individual? 

In short, it isn't. Pushing abortion to the states means pushing abortion to many legislatures that are interested in oppressing women, just as pushing ""slavery"" to the states was nothing more than pushing slavery to legislatures interested in oppressing people with African ancestry. It's a cushion; a dodge; an abdication of responsibility for deciding what is just in this country. 

If the federal government is infringing on ""states' rights"" by restricting abortions, how in the ever-loving ***fuck*** is a state not infringing on women's rights by restricting abortions? 

##States' Rights and the Electoral College.  

The Electoral College (EC) is another example of asserting that ""states"" should.have power, but not individuals. It was established in the US constitution in conjunction with the 3/5 compromise, which determined that enslaved people would count ""as 3/5 of a person"" in the state for the purposes of population count, representation in Congress, and therefore, in the Electoral College for presidential elections.  

Modern arguments in favor of the EC often say that the states with smaller populations would be forgotten and their interests ignored if it were abolished. This ensures ""the states"" all have their interests heard. But that is what *Congress* is for. The states with smaller populations *already have* representation in both the House of Representatives *and* the Senate. Both of which give greater weight to less densely populated (and, coincidentally, conservative) areas.  

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in the vote for president than *the people?* 

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in governing abortion than the people who can get pregnant?  

Why should ""the states"" have more interest in protecting slavery than the people who are being enslaved?

The answer is that the logic is unsound, because the question of ""states' rights"" has always been a messy and logically inconsistent affair. 

If you want to make a case for limiting government, do so without permitting lower-level governments to oppress people.

1eusfr9,CMV: Being ABLE to work hard is a privilege which the average (able-bodied) person isn't aware of  ,"Before you come @ me about how it's a privilege to be able to not work (and I agree that there are certainly many circumstances where this is the case) please hear my perspective out...

I have been on both spectrums of being physically healthy/able-bodied, and being extremely chronically ill/disabled. When I was younger, I was an athlete (working out 5-6 days a week, 2-3hrs/day), able to do school full-time, and get straight-A's, and had multiple jobs. Basically, I was a type-A extremely hard-working, productive, and efficient member of society.

When I developed multiple chronic illnesses and health conditions in my early 20's, I went from being a superwoman who could do it all to basically completely bedridden. For a period of time my hands were disabled, I had 10/10 pain throughout my body 24/7, searing migraines, and I was physically incapable of walking. Needless to say, I could not work *any* type of job (blue-collared, white-collared, or otherwise) in that condition. At the worst of my health problems, it was literally impossible for me to work and I did end up living in my car for a period of time (in the beginning my family didn't believe my chronic illness was real and kicked me out because they thought I was mentally ill/lazy). Even jobs that could be done 100% online (which are already extremely limited for many career paths, particularly 10 years ago when I was in my 20's) were not possible for me due to the hand paralysis, migraines, and extreme neurological conditions (including light sensitivity to screens and very bad cognitive issues/brain fog).

After being told it's all in my head and that I'm just lazy/don't want to work (despite me being an extremely hard-working person for my entire life prior to my diagnosis) by virtually all of society, almost a decade later I finally have several diagnoses that validate my disabilities. I am also fortunate to have improved to some degree where I can still work (but not nearly to the extent that I used to be able to) with certain accommodations but I am still very limited by severe chronic pain and daily symptoms. I had to chance my entire career path and life around my disability, because the path I was taking was simply not accessible to me.

My chronic illness/disabilities essentially ruined my 20's, destroyed my bank account (medical bills leaving me with no savings, so I am nowhere near being able to save for things like a home or retirement). Coming from this perspective, it irks me sometimes when people deny that health/ability privilege is a real thing and act as if they do not have privilege to be able to work. I understand the plight of the lower-class/middle-class working person who needs to work very hard, sometimes in multiple jobs, to have a roof over their head and put food on the table. But for some people with severe disabilities/chronic illnesses, no matter how hard they want to or try, this is quite literally not possible or accessible. Many of those people end up losing everything and becoming homeless, then being further blamed and stigmatized for their situation.",anonykitcat,353,0.6800000071525574,414,1723929838,2024-08-17 16:23:58,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eusfr9/cmv_being_able_to_work_hard_is_a_privilege_which/,8,2024
1evrkc0,CMV: I don't really understand why people care so much about Israel-Palestine ,"I want to begin by saying I am asking this in good faith - I like to think that I'm a fairly reasonable, well-informed person and I would genuinely like to understand why I seem to feel so different about this issue than almost all of my friends, as well as most people online who share an ideological framework to me.

I genuinely do not understand why people seem so emotionally invested in the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian Crisis. I have given the topic a tremendous amount of thought and I haven't been able to come up with an answer.

Now, I don't want to sound callous - I wholeheartedly acknowledge that what is happening in Gaza is horrifying and a genocide. I condemn the actions of the IDF in devastating a civilian population - what has happened in Gaza amounts to a war crime, as defined by international law under the UN Charter and other treaties.

However - I can say that about a huge number of ongoing global conflicts. Hundreds of of thousands have died in Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Ethiopia, Myanmar and other conflicts in this year. Tens of thousands have died in Ukraine alone. I am sad about the civilian deaths in all these states, but to a degree I have had to acknowledge that this is simply what happens in the world. I am also sad and outraged by any number of global injustices. Millions of women and girls suffer from sex trafficking networks, an issue my country (Canada) is overtly complicit in failing to stop (Toronto being a major hub for trafficking). Children continued to be forced into labour under modern slavery conditions to make the products which prop up the Western world. Resource exploitation in Africa has poisoned local water supplies and resulted in the deaths of infants and pregnant women all so that Nestle and the Coca Cola Company can continue exporting sugary bullshit to Europe and North America.

All this to say, while the Israel-Palestinian Crisis is tragic, all these other issues are also tragic, and while I've occasionally donated to a cause or even raised money and organized fundraisers for certain issues like gender equality in Canada or whatnot, I have mostly had to simply get on with my life, and I think that's how most people deal with the doomscrolling that is consuming news media in this day and age.

Now, I know that for some people they feel they have a more personal stake in the Israel-Palestine Crisis because their country or institution plays an active role in supporting the aggressor. But even on that front, I struggle to see how this particular situation is different than others - the United States and by proxy the rest of the Western world has been a principal actor in destabilizing most of the current ongoing global crises for the purpose of geopolitical gain. If anyone has ever studied any history of the United States and its allies in the last hundred years, they should know that we're not usually on the side of the good guys, and frankly if anyone has ever studied international relations they should know that in most conflicts all combatants are essentially equally terrible to civilian populations. The active sale of weapons and military support to Israel is also not particularly unique - the United States and its allies fund war pretty much everywhere, either directly or through proxies. Also, in terms of active responsibility, purchasing any good in a Western country essentially actively contributes to most of the global inequality and exploitation in the world.

Now, to be clear, I am absolutely not saying ""everything sucks so we shouldn't try to fix anything."" Activism is enormously important and I have engaged in a lot of it in my life in various causes that I care about. It's just that for me, I focus on causes that are actively influenced by my country's public policy decisions like gender equality or labour rights or climate change - international conflicts are a matter of foreign policy, and aside from great powers like the United States, most state actors simply don't have that much sway. That's even more true when it comes to institutions like universities and whatnot.

In summary, I suppose by what I'm really asking is why people who seem so passionate in their support for Palestine or simply concern for the situation in Gaza don't seem as concerned about any of these other global crises? Like, I'm absolutely not saying ""just because you care about one global conflict means you need to care about all of them equally,"" but I'm curious why Israel-Palestine is the issue that made you say ""no more watching on the side lines, I'm going to march and protest.""

Like, I also choose to support certain causes more strongly than others, but I have reasons - gender equality fundamentally affects the entire population, labour rights affects every working person and by extension the sustainability and effective operation of society at large, and climate change will kill everyone if left unchecked. I think these problems are the most pressing and my activism makes the largest impact in these areas, and so I devote what little time I have for activism after work and life to them. **I'm just curious why others have chosen the Israel-Palestine Crisis as their hill to die on, when to me it seems 1. similar in scope and horrifyingness to any number of other terrible global crises and 2. not something my own government or institutions can really affect (particularly true of countries outside the United States).**

1ew7ow3,"CMV: If You Vape Indoors in Public, You're a Dick","I feel like this should be common sense, but I still see a lot of people doing this and I want to hear the other side of the argument: why do you think it's okay to vape indoors in a public place?

I've seen this a number of times near me: a patron at a bar or restaurant sneaks a puff from their vape as soon as the bartender or server turns their back. It's easier to do, since it's quicker than lighting a cigarette and the vape pen can dispense just one puff unlike a cigarette. Clearly they know it's not allowed, or they wouldn't take measures to hide it too. 

The only argument I've heard is that ""it's just water vapor"", but that's just not true. The vape smoke has nicotine in it (that's sort of the point), as well as other chemicals to give it it's flavor/scent.

It may not be common knowledge, but the chemicals themselves have harmful effects on the lungs. If the smoker isn't aware of that, that might be (comparatively) understandable. However, they should be well-aware of the second-hand nicotine smoke they're blowing at people. Ignoring this seems selfish, and therefore dickish.

Are other people as bothered about this as I am? Is there a compelling reason why vapers can't just go outside like normal smokers do, outside of basic selfishness?",Riddle-Maker,609,0.75,582,1724088429,2024-08-19 12:27:09,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ew7ow3/cmv_if_you_vape_indoors_in_public_youre_a_dick/,8,2024
1ex7bwp,"CMV: There is no justification for the October 7th attack by Hamas, it was a terrorist attack, committed by a terrorist organisation and should be condemned ","I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not supporting what Israel and the IDF are doing and I condemn all the war crimes that they commit, however this seems to be causing people to overlook the other side of the conflict.

While I am sure that a lot of the pro Palestinian protestors don't support Hamas, or the 7th October attack and are just supporting the innocent civilians who are caught and killed in the crossfire of the Israel/Palestine war, however there seems to be a growing number that do, and it should be a security concern in all countries, that there is growing support for Hamas which is a recognised terrorist organisation.

From my view, the October 7th attack is one of the worst terrorist attacks in history, it was an attack on civilians, and if the population size between the US and Israel are scaled equally, it is many times worse than the 9/11 attacks (and not just in death toll).

A lot of pro Palestinian protestors seem to always fail to answer (yes/no) if they are asked if they condemn the October 7th attack or Hamas and usually do one of the following:

1.  Start talking about what Israel has done and the civilians they have killed to deflect the question 

As I mentioned at the start, I absolutely condemn and am against what Israel has done to civilians, however this should never justify any attack on civilians, when this argument is used this is often spun as an ""oppressed people fighting back"" narrative, and while I agree that the Palestinian people have definitely been oppressed, the October 7th attack is not how oppressed people fight back, oppressed people do not brutally attack civilians, victims of the Nazi's holocaust did not start brutally attacking German civilians, and I think most can agree that German civilians did not deserve to suffer after WW2 because of what the Nazi's did.

2. Outright denial the attack ever took place/claims no civilians were killed 

I don't really have anything to say that people who genuinely think the attack never happened other than that Hamas recorded themselves doing this attack for the world to see, has made their intentions clear that this attack is what they wanted, and that they will do it again. (Very few genuinely believe the attacks never happened, but there are some)

3. Israel knew about the attack / let it happen / didn't respond to it to use it as justification for the war

I am not certain about the truth of Israel's knowledge of the attack, and I don't think we could ever be certain of it and I don't deny that the above could be true. Regardless, this can't justify the killing of innocent civilians who certainly did not know they would be killed that day, this is like saying the Nazi's were justified in killing civilians in France and Poland when they invaded, because the French and Polish governments could've easily known that Hitler intended to invade and commit genocide many years before. 

Overall, I think Hamas must absolutely be eliminated and destroyed once and for all, and Israel has a right to defend itself from Hamas, but Israel and the IDF needs to also be held accountable for war crimes against civilians, and there needs to be a clear distinction between pro Palestine supporters who only want to support the innocent civilians vs the Hamas supporters who are supporting a terrorist organisation, otherwise we could reach a very scary point where extremism on all sides of all conflicts is already rising, where a large number on both sides will support/justify the killing of civilians.",Le_Corporal,1076,0.6499999761581421,2399,1724188682,2024-08-20 16:18:02,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ex7bwp/cmv_there_is_no_justification_for_the_october_7th/,8,2024
1excrxx,CMV: The semaglutide craze is going to evetually lead to an opioid-like health crisis,"This has been bothering me for a while and I want to know if I'm missing something here.  Right now though, no matter how I look at I'm convinced that the push of Ozempic/Wegovy and similar GLP1 drugs is going to end in a public health crisis in the vein of opioid.

Everything I see about these drugs is overwhelmingly positive to the point of feeling delusional.  The claimed benefits not only include weight loss, but apparently decreasing cardiovascular risk, treating addiction, reducing arthritis, cutting diabetes risk, etc.  It reads like an advertisement for scam supplement at times, as it can apparently cure everything.  I don't think I've ever seen anything regarding potential long term risks, or the consequences of suddenly ceasing use of it.  This is a drug that works on a core metabolic process and the body really likes to try and maintaining homeostasis by up- and down-regulating things.  As these drugs stimulate the release of insulin and suppress glucagon by imitating the GLP1 peptide, it seems logical to think the body might reduce it's response to this compound over time to maintain it's idea of homeostasis.  So if someone were to suddenly lose access to it?  It seems reasonable to think this would lead to a lack of insulin and overproduction of glucagon - a diabetes-like metabolic problem.

Also disturbing to me is the way the drug is being marketed as an option for everyone and being offered outside of doctor's offices.  This is an expensive monthly injection that's meant to be taken for life, yet it's being advertised for weight loss of around 30 lbs (by the pharma company itself no less) and is being made available to people through places like Weight Watchers.  What are people supposed to do once they reach their target weight?  Studies show that many people regain the lost weight after stopping, so what's next once the target is hit?  And I don't believe places like WW really care about using ""lifestyle changes"" with it, otherwise they wouldn't be offering it as a primary option vs other methods failing first.

At the root of all my concern is the absolutely insane financial incentive that pharma companies have to get as many people on the medication as quickly as possible, regardless of consequences.  At $3000 a month and intended to be permanent, every new patient represents tens or possible hundreds of thousands of future revenue.  Multiply that by tens of thousands of patients, and it's enough money to make Bezos jealous.  And with how we saw Purdue get off scot free from the opioid crisis, what incentive is there for these companies to care about the consequences?  It's free money and at worst they'll pay a fine that dwarves the profit these drugs are making them.  Instead, they have every incentive to hide any negative outcomes related to these drugs and push positive narratives at every turn.

Every one of these details leads me to believe this semeglutide craze will lead to a massive public health crisis on the level of opioid.   The hallmarks are all there:  a supposed miracle drug that makes huge profit for their manufacturers with no risk for consequences, being pushed on as many people as possible regardless of their needs, and potentially disastrous consequence if the medication is stopped which is a huge risk due to it's price and the lack of coverage by many insurance plan.  If this medication were to suddenly become unavailable to many people for whatever reason, there could be massive public health consequences that, per usual, the common citizen would bear the brunt of through suffering for those who are affected, and high costs for those who are not.

I'm more than open to hearing different perspectives, as I'm sure I might be missing something here.",shiningdialga13,398,0.7799999713897705,277,1724203043,2024-08-20 20:17:23,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1excrxx/cmv_the_semaglutide_craze_is_going_to_evetually/,8,2024
1exoky4,CMV: Pansexuality is the same as bisexuality ,"Admittedly I'm biased because I'm a bisexual, and have been out and proud for 16ish years, but there is literally no real distinction between the two as used today. I fully accept the original description of pansexuality was someone who was interested in literally everything (not just multiple genders but also all fetishes and kinks), but it is used today to mean someone who is attracted to all genders. Imo this is kinda biphobic, bc as far back as the 90s bisexual organisations have been very clear that many bisexuals are attracted to people outside the gender binary, I myself have always been attracted to all genders. I have once seen the distinction explained as pan people are attracted to trans people, and bi people aren't, but not only is that hideously transphobic, but also patently untrue. I have no issue with people calling themselves pan, omnisexual, or whatever, but afaic all these sexualities are literally just bisexuality with a different name. I will concede that in settings with aliens pansexuality does make sense, I think describing Jack harkness from torchwood as pan is fair (same for iron bull in dragon age), and if someone in real life actually does fit the original Freudian definition, that's fair too, but the vast majority of modern irl pan people could reasonably be described as bi.",69Whomst,494,0.6800000071525574,748,1724244012,2024-08-21 07:40:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1exoky4/cmv_pansexuality_is_the_same_as_bisexuality/,8,2024
1exu442,CMV: Obesity being treated as a mental health issue is the best course of action,"Obesity, as I currently understand it is mostly a mental health/distress tolerance problem. Think about how snappy you get when you get ""hangry"" that is what someone on a calorie deficit is going to feel like every day (for the most part). Ozempic I would even consider a mental health medication because it essentially removes the ability to experience the negative emotions we experience when our bodies start freaking out about perceived food scarcity (hunger).

One of the best indicators of adulthood obesity is having an ACE (adverse childhood experience) score of over three. The beginning of our current understanding of childhood trauma literally started at weight loss clinics.

With this in mind I present the following.

1.) Psychiatrists and Psychologists should be allowed to prescribe obesity managing medications. 

2.) Obesity should be a valid reason for mental healthcare to be covered by whatever system you get services from, wether the one we have in America (gross) or one run by your countries healthcare service

3.) Obesity should have talk therapy as a primary intervention. 

4.) Obese patients should be taught DBT ( Dialitetcal Behavioral Therapy) skills and management strategies  to increase their ability to deal with the negative emotions that come with being in a calorie deficit

5.) Obesity needs to be reframed to the public, it's not just that someone needs to eat less. It's someone needing to find a way to intake less calories (generally this is the cause of obesity), without the restriction becoming to miserable to be sustained.

 Managing obesity is something that is going to take trial and error and open communication between patient and provider, that happens way more often with a therapist than any other healthcare worker. 

Additionally there are ties to hunger levels and stress levels. Moving to a less taxing and stressful society also needs to happen if we want obesity rates to fall. It's real hard to sustain changes that make you feel bad when your material conditions also make you feel bad.

1exwwiv,CMV: gifted programs should not be removed from any STATE. ,"The Seattle school district and many other left-leaning states are planning to remove gifted programs for children due to a lack of racial representation in these programs. I believe this is unjustified and doesn’t make sense. It would be like making professional athletes go back to playing in an academy.

As someone who was part of a gifted program in high school, I found that regular schoolwork wasn’t challenging or engaging. It made me dread going to school, as it felt like placing an adult in a kindergarten class to learn 1+1 and expecting them to be excited about it for the next three years.

It’s also unfair to teachers and administrators, who are expected to adapt and create convoluted curricula for each individual when students are not separated by performance. They’re already underpaid and are being further burdened by the government to do extra work.

What happened to academic meritocracy? Why are we equating racial segregation with intellectual segregation?

Imagine if sports teams had similar policies, where instead of always picking the best players, they had to meet a racial quota.

Some might argue that gifted students have greater access to resources, which allows them to perform better in school, making it unfair for them to access better education and opportunities. But that same logic could be applied in reverse to any aspiring athlete: If someone had better access to equipment, nutrition, and trainers, should they also be excluded from gifted athlete programs?

1f0aj6r,"CMV: In the ""would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck"" question, picking one horse-sized duck is a strikingly stupid choice","I know I'm like 8 years late on this meme, but I feel like it faded away without reaching much of a consensus and it made me feel like an insane person because the answer seemed so incredibly obvious. So here I am dredging it up again, like an insane person. First, some priors about the hypothetical I'm addressing: 

* Let's discount the oft-cited cube square law which posits that a horse-sized duck would immediately collapse under its own weight. In the spirit of the hypothetical, let's assume physically viable animals whose strength and bone strength etc. has scaled linearly with their mass to allow for normal function. 
* Let's assume we have no weapons, or at least no sophisticated, pre-made weapons. I'm working from an assumption that we're totally unarmed, but if you want to argue a situation where we could pick up a stick or a rock or something I'm happy to engage with that as well. 
* You are allowed to wear normal clothing, e.g. let's say you are given 10 minutes in a normal department store to pick out an outfit. I'd be okay entertaining a scenario where you're naked, too. My main point is that you don't have access to armor or anything (though i think having armor would make the answer even more obvious.) 
* The animals in question fully understand that they are in a fight to the death against you. 
* The question is very specifically about who you think you are most likely to defeat; any questions about gaining glory or other social consequences are outside the scope of this argument. 

Okay so on to my position: 

**Picking a horse-sized duck is not only obviously wrong, it's downright foolish.** 

Let's start by focusing on the horse-sized duck and (an incomplete list of) the opportunities it has to kill us vs. how we could kill it:

* The duck would be *much* stronger than you - strong enough to break your bones with a peck or claw attack. Strong enough to kill you outright with a properly-landed blow. 
* The duck's beak is huge, rigid, and would be capable of devastating bludgeoning damage. 
* The duck's beak would be plenty big enough to grab you by the head, a limb, even your torso. 
* The duck's beak would likewise be able to bite you with great force, possibly enough to break your bones. 
* The duck has claws on its feet that it could use to rip you open. 
* The duck can *fucking fly*. And even if we agree for some reason that it can't, it's still a massive animal that can kill you in a single blow. 
* You have basically no method to kill the duck unarmed. Maaaybe you could get lucky and break one of its legs, but you're still left with an extremely large, angry animal that can easily break your bones by just flailing around. The duck's neck is too large and strong to be choked out. Possibly you could stuff yourself or objects down its throat until it chokes? But even then, you are attempting a precise maneuver against a massive animal that is also trying to kill you. 

Now to contrast let's examine the duck-sized horses:

* The horses would be *much* weaker than you - any individual horse would be unable to do much more than lightly push you a bit. 
* The horses' mouths, while formidable in a horse-sized animal, would be too small to even gain purchase on most of your body. When naked, you'd run the risk of maybe getting the tip of a toe or finger bit off, or maybe a light pinch on your shinbone or something. If you were could dress yourself, wearing basically any clothes at all would render you nigh-invulnerable to this attack. 
* That leaves their kicks, which would be an annoyance but unlikely to do any real harm besides light scratches and bruises. Their hooves are not particularly sharp and are certainly not designed to puncture or rip skin. The blunt-force damage that makes a normal horse so dangerous would be rendered basically moot by their relatively small size and lack of strength. 
* Horses are not particularly intelligent animals and are not capable of any kind of meaningful tactical collaboration. This massively mitigates the potential problem posed by the large number of horses. 
* Similarly, horses cannot climb or grapple you, so your exposure would be limited to a few horses at any given time. This fact, combined with the previous point, means that there is very little threat of being overwhelmed and dragged down. At least until you have already worn yourself out to the point of exhaustion. 
* Horse legs are notoriously spindly and fragile. While scaling them down would reduce the risk of broken legs, it would still be pretty easy to break their limbs and incapacitate them. 
* You could kill or at least incapacitate the horses with normal kicks and stomps. You could easily pick up a horse and snap its neck, especially given the extra leverage offered by their long heads. A hundred is a pretty big number, but every individual horse would be trivially easy to defeat. The main challenge here is cardio, not fighting skill. 

Please note: I am NOT saying that I, or anyone, would obviously defeat 100 duck-sized horses every time. I am very specifically talking about the choice between 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck: on this question, I think the average human has about a 99% better chance of defeating the horses than they do the duck and I seriously question the judgment of anyone who picks the alternative.",tsaihi,630,0.8799999952316284,433,1724520014,2024-08-24 12:20:14,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1f0aj6r/cmv_in_the_would_you_rather_fight_100_ducksized/,8,2024

1f2jm73,CMV: Overfeeding your child is a form of abuse,"I don't know if this comes from a place of bias or personal experience, but I feel like there is a huge issue with young kids being way too fat. I'm not talking about a little baby fat that leans out later on in life, I mean morbidly obese children with heart conditions at the ripe young age of ten.

When I was a child my parents never cared to learn about healthy eating. They both have been obese for the entirety of my life. All I ate as a kid was McDonald's, meatloaf and boiled vegetables (un-seasoned). We always had ice cream in the fridge and loads of sugary things throughout the house. I drank so much coke that I had withdrawal symptoms so sever I was bedridden for days. I had body image issues, problems with my stomach and effectively had to educate myself on what being ""healthy"" means. Now, I myself wasn't obese (even though I was definitely fat) and I don't think my parents hit that threshold of food abuse that I've laid out in the title, but I definitely believe that if I was indulged more as a kid I could have easily hit that point. I also recently have found out that I have an auto immune disease that was exasperated due to my poor diet as a child. 

I've read so many stories of kids who have gone past that point. There was one where they're height was stunted due to the excessive body weight putting pressure on their thyroid and heart. I read another where a child was given candies by every member in her family due to their cultural views on how giving food is the equivalence of love.

It can physically harm the kids (like it has me), or it can cause mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and body dysmorphia. 

Maybe I'm being too harsh on parents who they themselves don't know any better, but I just feel like negligence isn't an acceptable excuse for putting your kid's health at risk. Am I being too harsh? I look forward to hearing opinions.

1f2pjou,CMV:  Democrats are getting overconfident about the possible debate between Kamala and Trump. ,"I wanted to make this post for quite a while but couldn’t find time to respond to people who will respond to my post.

Before the first debate, I read a lot of left-wing blogs which kept saying Biden would trounce Trump in the debate.  At that time itself, I felt that he should not debate Trump because there is no benefit for him and nothing that Trump says will hurt him with his base. In other words Biden has all to lose and Trump has nothing to lose.

The debate went magnitudes worse than I had ever feared and it culminated with Biden, eventually, dropping out. 

 I now see the same thing with people eager for a Kamala vs Trump debate. I stand by my position that Trump has nothing to lose in this and Kamala has everything to lose. Trump could get on stage, crap his pants, and sling his poo at the audience and he would still not lose a single supporter. Granted, he won’t gain any supporters from such behavior either . Kamala on the other hand could make a mistake like she did against Tulsi in 2020 and could destroy the campaign as it is. 

So there you have it. That’s my view. Change it.

1f4aebw,CMV: The 'both sides are do nothing corporate stooges' attitude that many far leftists hold is wrong and dangerous,"I've seen a lot of people on the far left saying that Democrats and Republicans are very similar and both doing the bidding of their corporate masters. 

As a Democrat, I vehemently disagree. I do acknowledge that large corporations contribute a significant amount to Democrat campaigns, but Democrats have also passed-and tried to pass- policies that limit corporate power. 

For example, reducing the cost of insulin. Big pharma doesn't want those limits.

Democrats attempted to pass build back better but a now independent and another now independent allowed it to fail. That was major legislation that would have helped a lot of people and Democrats fought tooth and nail to pass it. 

Democrats have also implemented additional regulations around things like food safety. This does not help big corporations in the slightest. 

That's why I think the attitude is wrong. I think it's dangerous because of two far more critical differences. 

First one side is trying to undermine Democracy while the other is trying to protect it. And the idea that at the end of the day both parties are do nothing corporate stooges completely misses the very real threat of somebody who will not concede even when it appears they know they've lost. 

Second, one side is going to great lengths to fight a major existential threat-climate change- and the other seems to still be dragging their feet. And while I think Democrats need to do way more to fight climate change, at least they have passed policies to help with that. 

To be clear, my view isn't that the far left thinks the two parties are identical. My concern is that they're being grouped and this makes it seem like what's happening right now is normal politics. The GOP is its own nightmarish thing right now, something highly unprecedented and dangerous. If dangerous individuals are seen as just more corrupt candidates in a two party system, then that makes it seem like they're a reasonable but not great choice. Not an aspiring dictator. 

That's my view but I'm curious to hear other views on this

but i’m gonna focus on demisexual bc it makes me the most confused. 

So demisexual is supposedly when a person feels sexually attracted to someone only after they've developed a close emotional bond with them. Simple enough, right? Wrong, because sexuality is a person's identity in relation to the gender or genders to which they are typically attracted; sexual orientation. Which means demisexual is not a sexuality by definition. 

Someone who is gay, straight, lesbian, or bi could all be demi because demisexual isn’t a sexuality it’s just when people get comfortable enough to have sex with their partner, which is 100% fine but not a damn sexuality. not everyone can have sex with someone when they first meet them and that’s normal, but i’ve got this weird inclination that people who use the term demisexual to describe themselves can’t find the difference between not being completely comfortable with having sex with someone until they get to know them or feeling a complete lack of sexual attraction until they get to know someone. 

maybe i’m missing something but i really can’t fully respect someone if they use this term like it’s legit. to me, it’s just a label to make people feel different and included in the lgbt community.

1f8d5lm,"CMV: Broadway would never allow a “Book of Mormon” style, satirical play on the Quran and neither would most Muslims","Say what you will about the LDS church but they at least have a good sense of humor about themselves. While the play is actually a love letter — in many ways — organized Christianity from atheists, it still does have many biting criticisms of the Mormon church and it takes having a somewhat of a thick skin to take them all with a smile. 

I don’t think this would be the same with Muhammad and Quran. In part because the God of the Quran is a lot more oblique and mysterious, the connection people feel with him is displaced to Muhammad instead. Hence the treatment of him as if he is god, not just a mortal man who’s his messenger. 

All this to say, there would be tons of public protests all over the world, bomb threats and gun threats in the lead up to opening day of the show. But, I think in all honesty it would be more outside America than within it. American Muslims, though they might be more upset with the blasphemous message and disrespectful tone, are pretty liberal overall and not much different from American Christians. Worldwide im sure there would be lots of “death to America and the gays on broadway” chants too. 

Nevertheless it would be an extremely volatile, toxic issue the pick-me Mercedes mujahideen type liberals who would lose their mind because they’d have to choose between treating Islam like Christianity conservatives or being “one of the good ones.” But if you’re in America, I can’t speak for anywhere else, part of the buy-in is being okay with people making fun of your religion.

1f8yzr0,Cmv: Bruce wayne would improve Gotham much more by investing his billions in society rather than by becoming batman,"According to Forbes, our hero has a wealth of nearly 10 billion in a city that is blatantly a dystopia where there is a huge class difference.

Now, stop robberies is a heroic thing to do but the high rate of criminality in gotham is due to the extreme poverty and social difference.
The Joker can be see as a proof that super-criminals of Gotham did not pop up from another planet of pire evilness but arise also because of the sick society they live in.

My view is that the crime in gotham would be less if the billionaire invested in schools and social works or used his money to make a political rise instead of buying some million-dollar suits to beat up a single mugger.

It be summarized as follows:

1. Batman tends not to save the world (like superman) but his city (like spider man)

2. Gotham is a socio-economical nightmare and this has caused its high criminal rate (super criminal aside), anyway despite the super criminal the majority of suffering in common people of the city is caused by poverty and instability 

3. Batman would have the power to change the whole city by his economic means but instead of curing the causes of evil (the dystopian society) he tries to solve only the effects it produces (crime).

In conclusion, yes maybe you would have still Super villains but common thieves and murderers would decrease much more by improving the city wuth money than by punching some of them in the streets dressed up as a bat.

- I’m an American dual citizen. I have been old enough to vote in one presidential election in both countries. For the election outside of the US, I needed to have a valid ID that was issued by the government to all citizens over the age of 18 in order to vote. Having experienced this, calls for voter ID in the US seem totally reasonable to me, with one important caveat. There needs to be a way for American citizens to easily get an ID. Getting a traditional form of ID like a driver’s license or passport is not universally accesible, you need to know how to drive to get a license or pay in order to apply for a passport. If you fix this by getting the government to issue voter ID cards to people who apply for free, then I really see no drawbacks to Voter ID policies.

1f91whl,Cmv: Republicans shouldn’t be voting for Trump after his attempt to remain in power after losing an election. ,"Trump tried to execute a bloodless coup after losing the 2020 election. The fake elector scheme, telling Pence not to certify the results, having states individually not certify the results, are all such damaging and despicable acts, that even if they agree with him on policy, should have stopped Republicans from voting for him in the primaries and even the general election. 

There’s no compelling evidence the 2020 election was rigged. Most of the federal judiciary at the time and the Supreme Court was made up of Republicans, many of whom were appointed by Trump, and yet Trump still lost in court. He and his supporters make plenty of claims in public, but as soon as they were under oath and had to submit evidence subject to cross examination, they had none. 

Trump’s attempt to subvert our democracy is so incredibly damaging. It’s incredibly dangerous to set a precedent where the party that loses the election can remain in power anyway. Dictatorship is almost universally a bad idea with bad outcomes. 

The arguments that Democrats do the same thing are so poor, I’m skeptical they are being made in good faith. There are one or two comments Hillary has made since losing that I think are damaging and that she shouldn’t have made, but it’s not comparable to what Trump did. Hillary conceded and did not try to remain in power after losing. She did not try to pursue illegal or unethical schemes to remain in power. Gore challenged the vote in Florida when he had a legitimate reason to think he might have won, and once he lost, he conceded and did not try to remain in power. 

If a Dem had done what Trump did, I would absolutely vote for a McCain or a Romney over the dem. Democracy is too important. 

The only possible exception to the argument that I see is for people who actually believe abortion is 100% truly murder. Unlike the 2020 election which was demonstrably not rigged, abortion is a murkier philosophical question so I find it difficult to simply dismiss their view even if I disagree with it. It is also hard for me to advocate for someone to vote for a party that is pushing for the legalization of murder.

1fagy4o,CMV: Most fines should be replaced with unpaid community service ,"Fines are not only unpopular and seen as a way for the state to make more money but I also find they're not very effective. Yes maybe someone will think twice but for many people it's probably worth the risk of getting fined once every few years to do something against the law (especially traffic violations). In most countries they're also not fair because for someone with more money it would pretty much be meaningless to pay a fine.

So why not replace them with unpaid community service with the number of hours depending on the gravity of what you've done? Community service is already something that exists so why shouldn't we expand it to most things that we currently apply fines for? I feel like people will probably think twice if they have to miss a large part of their weekend for a month rather than having to pay a fine in a few seconds.

Obviously there would be some exceptions but I'm saying for most fines it would work. For example, say someone is going 20mph (30km/h) over the speed limit.

1fboo3p,CMV: Hijabs are sexist,"I've seen people (especially progressive people/Muslim women themselves) try to defend hijabs and make excuses for why they aren't sexist.

But I think hijabs are inherently sexist/not feminist, especially the expectation in Islam that women have to wear one. The basic idea behind wearing a hijab (why it's a thing in the first place) is to cover your hair to prevent men from not being able to control themselves, which is problematic. It seems almost like victim-blaming, like women are responsible for men's impulses/temptations. Why don't Muslim men have to cover their hair?

I've heard feminist Muslim women try to make defenses for it. (Like, ""It brings you closer to God,"" etc.) But they all sound like excuses, honestly. This is basically proven by the simple fact that women don't have to wear one around other women or their male family members, but they have to wear it around other men that aren't their husbands.

1fc3l7o,cmv: there is no reason sex work should be illegal,"The number 1 argument against it is that there is a potential for sex trafficking, but this doesn't mean you ban the practice as a whole, the logical next step is that you make the job safer (which could be better done if it was regulated), not ban it unless inherently the position had some aspect of sex trafficking to it, , we wouldn't and don't apply this logic to most other facets of life, (don't drive cars because you could die in a car crash), and especially not other jobs, the reason it's illegal can't be solely based on how much harm it causes. 

The second most common argument is that it is inherently coercive, that the sex worker is inherently in a lesser position of power, and it is not completely consensual from both sides, in this case, I don't know why sex would be someone magically different than any other scenario where some inherent aspect of the person is being used for monetary gain (ignoring the fact that sex work isn't entirely based on the body of the worker anyway). You could certainly argue that by nature of their life circumstances, a mcdonalds employee is pressured into working in a job they don't want in the same way sex work couldn't be considered technically consensual because the sex worker isn't doing it for their own enjoyment necessarily, but because they have to because of life circumstances.

1fctdjq,CMV: Universal Healthcare is less expensive and more efficient than the private American model,"Universal healthcare is actually way more efficient than the system we have in the U.S., and despite what some people say, it won’t bankrupt the country. Plenty of countries have made universal healthcare work for them without sinking their economies. Take Canada and the UK, for example: they’ve had universal healthcare for decades and, overall, spend way less per person than the U.S. does. According to a report from The Commonwealth Fund, the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on healthcare as these other countries but has worse outcomes in key areas like life expectancy and chronic illness management.

A common argument against universal healthcare is that it would be too expensive and would require higher taxes, which could cripple the economy. But here's the thing, Americans are already paying a lot for healthcare, just in different ways. Instead of paying higher taxes, most people are dealing with expensive insurance premiums, copays, and surprise medical bills. While taxes might go up with universal healthcare, people would actually save more money because they wouldn’t be paying for private insurance or out-of-pocket costs. Plus, a single-payer system would allow the government to negotiate drug prices, which could further lower costs overall.

Some people point to long wait times in countries like the UK to argue that universal healthcare doesn’t work. Yes, the UK has had issues with wait times, but it’s not like the U.S. system is any better when it comes to accessing care. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Americans often have to wait just as long, if not longer, to see specialists, especially if they don’t have good insurance. And let’s not forget that a lot of Americans avoid going to the doctor at all because they’re worried about the costs, even if they have insurance. So, the argument about wait times doesn’t hold up when you consider the whole picture.

Another reason universal healthcare is more efficient is that it cuts down on the massive administrative costs that come with private insurance. Right now, a huge chunk of U.S. healthcare spending goes toward paperwork, insurance claims, and bureaucracy, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). With universal healthcare, you could eliminate most of those costs, allowing more money to go directly to patient care instead of getting lost in administrative overhead.

In the end, the U.S. is already spending a ton on healthcare but getting mediocre results compared to countries with universal systems. By switching to a more efficient system that focuses on prevention and removes the need for private insurers, we could improve outcomes and reduce overall costs without bankrupting the country. Other countries have figured it out, and there's no reason the U.S. can’t do the same.",TheAntiCoomLord,1206,0.8299999833106995,967,1725898589,2024-09-09 11:16:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fctdjq/cmv_universal_healthcare_is_less_expensive_and/,9,2024
1fd3qbw,"CMV: Regardless of where you stand on the abortion debate, the ""unborn"" should always have fewer rights than those who are born. ","I think it's ridiculous that anyone thinks the rights of the ""unborn"" should even come close to the rights of the born. People in my conservative family and hometown all firmly believe that unborn embryos and fetuses deserve the same rights as born babies. To me, the issue can be simplified by a very simple thought experiment. 

*You find yourself in a fertility clinic that is burning down. You estimate that you have about 5 minutes to escape. You're standing next to a random toddler that's looking at you for help. You are also aware of 50 frozen embryos nearby and you know you can save a few of them if you hurry, but you can't carry very many if you're also carrying the toddler. You see three choices and have to act quick, which one do you choose?*

*1. Pick up the toddler and run out of the building as fast as you can*

*2. Pick up the toddler and try to save as many frozen embryos and run out of the building as fast as you can*

*3. Try to save as many frozen embryos as possible and leave the toddler behind*

To me, the **only** sane answer is 1. You pick up the toddler and run out of the building as fast as you can. If I chose option 2, I would be risking the toddler's life as well as my own for what I consider an unnecessary risk. Even stopping to save a single frozen embryo (and ensure it is properly stored so it does not thaw out) means precious time lost and potential smoke inhalation for the toddler and me. 

If I choose option 3, I am responsible for the death of the born person no matter how many frozen embryos I save. 

I have posed this scenario to many of my conservative family members and none of them are willing to answer the question and inevitably go off topic. 

I believe that any sane person would always prioritize the safety of the born person. Yet I see very passionate arguments from conservatives about the rights of the unborn, as if the unborn were truly just as human as a born person. 

I am not denying that an unborn embryo or fetus deserve some dignity, that's why we have laws against endangering the unborn. But my real issue is this pervasive idea that the unborn are equal to the born. We can argue about the unborn being ""50%"" or ""80%"" or on a sliding scale of equality as they get closer to being born, but at no point, in my view, does an unborn person have 100% the same value as a baby who is being born right now or is already born.

This is a question about how they are framed. 

I don't believe ""white privilege"" is the most fitting title for the term to describes things like the ability to walk down a street without being seen as a criminal, to have access to safe utilities, or to apply for a job without fear that your name would bar you from consideration. I don't see these as privilege, rather I see that is those capabilities as things I believe everyone inherently deserve.

A privilege, something like driving, is something that can be taken away, and I think framing it as such may to some sound like you are trying to take away these capabilities from white people, which I don't believe is the intent. 

Rather, I think the goal is to remove these barriers of hindrances so that all people may be able to enjoy these capabilities, so I think the phenomenon would be better deacribed as ""black barriers"" or ""minority hinderences"". I am not fixed on the name but you get the gist.

I think to change my mind you would have to convince me that the capabilities ascribed to white privilege are not something we want to expand access to all people as a basic expectation.",Atticus104,425,0.6700000166893005,855,1725990698,2024-09-10 12:51:38,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fdo64a/cmv_white_privilege_would_be_better_discussed_if/,9,2024

Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was killed by a bullet Israel alleges was aimed at the **leader of a protest.** Amazingly to me, the White House has *hatched* a completely far fetched idea suggesting a sniper bullet ""ricochet"" caused an American civilian to be shot in the head and killed.

1ff2phz,CMV: Pedophiles Are Treated Unfairly,"Alright, calm down. I can already hear the pitchforks. I'll clarify two things before I begin: 

1: My post refers to **non-offending** pedophiles. Those who have an attraction toward children who have **not** committed a crime. Anybody who has committed an offence against a child should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. 

2: I am not a pedophile. Many people assume that anybody who speaks up on such a topic must automatically be involved, but the reason for my opinion is two fold. I was sexually abused as a child and I now work with young people who were released from a variety of institutions (detention centres, mainly), many of whom either suffered sexual abuse, or engaged in it. I am not a doctor, nor am I a psychologist. 

  
So, my view is relatively straightforward. I believe that society has demonised pedophiles to a point that makes life less safe for children. 

I believe that every non-offending pedophile should be treated with the same respect, care and compassion that we give to any other member of society who is suffering with a mental illness. Treatment in the form of counselling/therapy or anything else that is possible, should be widely available and completely confidential. 

I believe that the rhetoric of 'kill all pedophiles' does nothing but prevent these people from coming forward to receive the help that they need to stop them from acting on their thoughts. 

Finally, I believe that if we, as a society, showed more compassion to these people, and encouraged getting professional help like we do with many major mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc) that the world would be a much safer place for the most vulnerable members of our communities.

1fhpjya,"CMV: Making a roommate rental posting for ""Gujarati Only"" or ""Filipino Preferred"" is racist","There has been an increase in Canadian urban hubs of seeing immigrants (of different nationalities) post their nationality preference in the listing for a roommate. The law states that shared accommodation is not covered by protections against discrimination. While this has been occurring for over 10 years, it has come more to the forefront as there is a significant housing shortage in those same areas in Canada, and people are more aware of housing issues.

I am also an immigrant. In any roommate posting I've ever made, I posted details about myself, and then assessed whether the other person jived with me. I cannot fathom meeting someone who was a great fit, but rejecting them due to their ethnic background. I never thought to filter by race or ethnicity, since it felt so wrong.

**Summarized Opinion:**

* I'm not questioning the legality of the issue. I believe searching for a roommate on the lifestyle and principles you have is fine. You have to live with them after all. 
* **Stating your own characteristics in a roommate search are fine, eg:** ""I am from the Philippines, speak English and Tagalog, I am a vegetarian, devout Christian, 9-5 job etc""
* **Searching for a roommate with criteria that discriminates on mutable characteristics are fine, eg:** ""I would like a roommate who is clean, quiet, doesn't WFH""
* **Specifying boundaries isn't an issue, eg:** ""I don't drink, so prefer not to have parties or alcohol in the house. I'm a strict religious vegetarian, so we'd need to keep our food separate.""
* **Searching for a roommate using immutable characteristics such as ethnic background**, and by saying ""Gujarati Only"" or ""Chinese Preferred"" **is racist.**

People have said that listing all this out takes too long, isn't it simpler to list the one word that you know will match all your criteria, ie... **your racial/ethnic preference**? I feel like the 'culture' argument is being used to hide the poster's own xenophobia, and dislike of meeting or interacting meaningfully with other cultures. I feel like they're being excused due to being refugees/immigrants, and that it's a double standard.

Those who would rather live in a tyranny or other aristocratic system, as long as their needs and values are met. 

The vast part of the republican voters does not want to get rid of democracy - nor is it in their best interest - and are just un- or misinformed about current events. Even if your opinions are generally in line with most of the things Trump stands for, and you're actively opposed to everything Harris stands for, it should not matter since one side does not adhere to democratic values and the other does. I understand that a lot of information that people in the US get is heavily colored in favour of one candidate or the other

All of this has been made especially clear since January 6th; if you support a candidate that attempted to commit a coup d'était, you want to subvert democracy, or you don't have the correct information to make an informed choice.

I was born and raised in a Muslim-majority country. When I moved to the West, I was surprised to see how the white people here (particularly those leaning left) behave as if everything bad happening in the world is their direct fault. There is so much focus on being politically correct and tolerant, yet it seems to be the status quo to constantly shit on white people. 

I’ve had conversations with people who have this dislike for the white population, and they tell me that this hate stems from the West’s involvement in colonisation and now the white Westerners are to pay the price for the actions of their ancestors. This makes no sense. Many non Western countries out there have done horrible things, have invaded and colonised other states, waged cruel wars and the list goes on. Another argument I’m presented with is how there is still exploitation of particularly African countries by the Western nations. But how does attacking uninvolved white people help those impacted by this exploitation? Also, non Western countries also exploit other states.

There is absolutely such a thing as racism towards white people. Since I’m not white, people holding these views feel very comfortable talking bad about random white people and unironically call them colonisers in my presence. And the white folks will just take it all and apologise on top of it. Why? You never personally colonised anyone, if your great great someone did, that’s not your fault and not something you ought to make apologies for.

I don’t understand why you put up with this, especially in your own countries. It wouldn’t fly where I was born, but here it seems a societal norm even.

1fj9b69,CMV: The view “abortion should be illegal except for cases of rape” is impossible to actually have as a policy in practice.,"Let’s assume every single woman who is a victim of SA reported literally the same day and the man is arrested the same day. Even in this scenario, you’d be lucky to have your rapist charged and convicted within your pregnancy period, and if you did the baby would probably be almost born anyway. Evidence collecting, discovery, motions, trial, getting a verdict takes way more time than people realize. 

I know many of you are thinking “durrr let’s just expedite these trials.” First to that, it’s hilarious seeing the party that has prided itself on defending the rights of accused rapists take that stance, that we should just greatly diminish the rights of the accused and hold an unusually fast trial for one of the most serious crimes there is. Second, even expedited litigation wouldn’t fix the issue. Inevitably there will be disputes and issues before trial, court delays, and other things that push even expedited trials to 6-12 months after the offense.

I haven’t even taken account the fact that basically every rapist that is found takes a long time to identify and arrest, haven’t mentioned that only 10% of crimes are ever solved in the USA, and haven’t made any arguments about how unfair the justice system can be to rape victims. 

TLDR: we could never arrest and convict rapists quick enough (without greatly violating their constitutional rights) as to have a policy of abortions illegal except for rape.

1fkl7y7,CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause,"I’ll start by saying I’m Jewish, and vaguely a Zionist in the loosest sense of the term (the state of Israel exists and should continue to exist), but deeply critical of Israel and the IDF in a way that has cause me great pain with my friends and family. 

To the CMV: Hezbollah is a recognized terrorist organization. It has fought wars with Israel in the past, and it voluntarily renewed hostilities with Israel after the beginning of this iteration of the Gaza war because it saw an opportunity Israel as vulnerable and distracted. 

Israel (I’ll say ‘allegedly’ for legal reasons, as Israel hasn’t yet admitted to it as of this writing, but, c’mon) devised, and executed, a plan that was targeted, small-scale, effective, and with minimal collateral damage. It intercepted a shipment of pagers that Hezbollah used for communications and placed a small amount of explosives in it - about the same amount as a small firework, from the footage I’ve seen. 

These pagers would be distributed by Hezbollah to its operatives for the purpose of communicating and planning further terrorist attacks. Anyone who had one of these pagers in their possession received it from a member of Hezbollah. 

The effect of this attack was clear: disable Hezbollah’s communications system, assert Israel’s intelligence dominance over its enemies, and minimize deaths. 

The attack confirms, in my view, that Israel has the capability to target members of Hamas without demolishing city blocks in Gaza. It further condemns the IDFs actions in Gaza as disproportionate and vindictive. 

I know many people who have been active on social media across the spectrum of this conflict. I know many people who post about how they are deeply concerned for Palestinians and aggrieved by the IDFs actions. Several of them have told me that they think the pager attack was smart, targeted and fair. 

I still know several people who are still posting condemnations of the pager attack. Many of them never posted anything about Palestine before October 7, 2023. I belief that most of them are interacting with this issue because it is trendy. 

What will CMV: proof that the pager attack targeted civilians, suggestions of alternative, more targeted and proportionate methods for Israel to attack its enemies.

1fmoifs,"CMV: Joining the military is not inherently noble, and treating military servicepeople as more noble than civilians is misguided","Search the web and you’ll quickly discover that the reasons most men and women join the military are related to personal gain. Reasons listed usually include things like:

- “It pays well”.
- “I wanted to travel the world.”
- “I needed to get through college.”
- “I wanted to fly a helicopter.”
- “I wanted to make Papa proud.”
- “My buddy joined.”

Such reasons are not noble. The following is an example of a noble reason:

- “I have throughly thought through the implications of how my country is positioned geopolitically, I understand how our national military budget is spent, and I have fully examined the ethics of offensive military programs. I am fully convinced that our military operations are ethically sound. I thus firmly believe that by serving I would be doing the Right Thing.”

It’s incredibly rare to hear anyone giving such a thoroughly nuanced reason for enlisting which includes a justification for any particular “war”.

1fnwlrq,CMV: “Racism = prejudice + power” misunderstands what racism is,"
I’m a leftist and this argument is used a lot by leftists as a way to brush off interpersonal racism against white people, but I think this is harmful because it unnecessarily combines the definitions of interpersonal and systemic racism, and it’s important to distinguish the two.

90% of the time people who complain about anti-white racism are full of shit but the right way to deal with it is to either ignore them or confront them on their argument directly. I think it’s fair to say that interpersonal racism against whites is less of a problem for a lot of reasons (either because it’s less common, it doesn’t tap into trauma in the same way it does for POC, or it has less severe effects because anti-white rhetoric doesn’t affect whites systematically). But because those arguments are more complicated and people don’t wanna take the effort to make them, they come up with this new definition of racism that makes no sense and just serves to shut up people who don’t agree with it.

If interpersonal racism is only valid when accompanied by systemic racism, asian americans who aren’t first-gen immigrants can’t experience racism, since they don’t experience racism systemically. Other racial minorities can’t experience racism from black americans since black people suffer from systemic racism in america more than any other group by far, and therefore have less power in society.

If interpersonal racism was defined by the existence of systemic racism, there would be no need to distinguish the two. But it’s really important to understand the differences between types of racism so we can be specific when talking about racism and discussing its consequences. If this means acknowledging that white people can technically experience racism, that’s fine and doesn’t contradict the struggles of racial minorities. I also think turning the definition of racism into an equation is trying to “quantify” racism and turning it into oppression olympics which is always unhelpful.

I want my view changed because if there’s a good reason for me to agree with the “prejudice + power” statement, I wanna know about it.",Ill-Cat4533,826,0.7599999904632568,928,1727128646,2024-09-23 16:57:26,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fnwlrq/cmv_racism_prejudice_power_misunderstands_what/,9,2024

I go to the grocery store almost every day and over the last few years I've noticed the influx of people just walking In and walking out with shopping carts loaded with food and booze. The workers tell me the police won't do anything unless it's a felony charge.

1fpsled,"CMV: Americans' current use of the term ""middle-class"" is a out of step with standard English and is a politically-motivated con.","In the broader Anglosphere, the term ""middle-class"" is used to describe the socio-economic class of households that enjoy middle-level incomes but also a suite of social practices. While there is no universal definition, many would include things like a university-level education, salaried position in a profession or ""white-collar"" job, travel abroad, considerable savings and job/financial security and so on.

In the US, the term ""middle-class"" has been co-opted to describe now something closer to what the wider world understands as ""working class"" - people who have paid employment, possibly shiftwork or casualised, often in blue-collar trades, with significant financial precarity. Many American sitcoms show ""middle-class"" (US-sense) families - like *The Simpsons*. A recent [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/02/15/middle-class-financial-security/) poll suggested only 30% of Americans consider a college education a marker of being middle class. This is not how the term is used in the UK, Canada, Australia (or other English-speakers in, for example, India).

The point of the term ""middle-class"" is to indicate there is an economic class ""above"" (in some sense) and ""below"". Using the term ""middle-class"" to describe people who the wider world describe as ""working class"" is a form of flattery (maybe) but also a piece of political theatre: ""hey, you're not on food stamps so you're middle class"" is a great way to deflect from people being systematically exploited in ways out-of-step with other English-speaking countries.

1fpssmp,Cmv: You can absolutely be racist to white people,"I hate when people say that you can't be racist to white people. As far as i'm concerned it means ""i'm racist but i don't wanna take accountability for it so i'm gonna water it down to prejudice and use my marganalization as an excuse"" 

Let's take a look at some definitions of racism and go over them. This is the one you get by google. It comes from oxford languages.


""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.""

First of all. The definition clearly states that racism is typically experienced by minorities/marganalized people but not exclusively. If this was the case then the definition wouldn't have the word ""typically"" in it.

This definition also describes the fact that there are different types of racism (such as interpersonal racism and institutional racism) and white people can absolutely experience racism on an interpersonal level

I'll also go over a second definition by merriam webster

1
: a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race

also : behavior or attitudes that reflect and foster this belief : racial discrimination or prejudice

2
a
: the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another

b
: a political or social system founded on racism and designed to execute its principles

This clearly also describes that racism can manifest in different ways. With what was being described under section 1 would be called interpersonal racism and what would be described under section 2 would  be described as systemic/institutional racism.

People say stuff like ""you can't be racist to white people"" and ""black people can't be racist"" to justify/downplay hatred towards white people. I have even heard that ""hate crime against white people is not a thing"" BUT IT IS A THING. if you committ a crime against someone because of their race it is a hate crime and being marganalized and opressed is not an excuse for that

We need to stop giving BIPOC passes when they say something racist about white people. I see it on tiktok all of the time. I hate it when they call me ""palm colored"" just call me ""white"" or caucasian. I am not going to be anyone's punching bag. You need to realize that the mindset that one race is ""less than"" is exactly what created the system of opression in the first place and if you are truly serious about equality, BIPOC should be held to the same standards as white people. Not to a lesser standard. I honestly think saying that shouldn't even be controversial but here we are.

After going on that rant, he goes on to talk about the 2 week trip to Europe he just got back from and drives a 2023 car and was wearing designer everything. I

 constantly see this narrative across all social media and especially on reddit that the ""system"" is broken and I don't think its a good thing at all. The government has always been shady, sleazy, corrupt, inept, and there is always something you can point at to place blame if you look hard enough. It's not an excuse to give up on your responsibility of your quality of life, or your moral obligation to try and make the society you live in a better place. 

Gen Z seems to have this attitude that it's not on them to fix anything and that the government should be responsible for their quality of life, and until that magic flip switches they don't need to take accountability for their bad decisions. This is leading to more and more Gen Z's stopping caring about the future, making self destructive decisions for immediate satisfaction, financially and otherwise which makes their lives worse, and then since they are miserable they want everyone else to be miserable, and anyone who isn't miserable got ""lucky"". I think when they get older they will be suffering the consequences of these choices far more than any amount of suffering caused by who is president, what dumb laws are made or not made etc. 

Despite all of the negativity you see on reddit the following are true and don't line up with the narrative that Gen Z has it worse than any other generation:

- Gun violence and violent crime in general has significantly decreased since the 80s and 90s. 

- Police violence has been stagnant, if not declining in the last 20 years. 

- The average IQ of people has increased several points per decade

- Wealth inequality is actually **decreasing** in the US, and decreasing even more rapidly globally

- The job market is basically back to average after the pandemic

- The average lifespan in the US is increasing significantly every year

- Women have far more opportunities and choices for career/lifestyle than ever before

-We are not at risk of overpopulation and natural resources are plenty and we are more efficient than ever at using them

-The worlds hunger problem while not solved, is dramatically better than it was 30 years ago. In the US almost nobody starves to death and those cases are due to severe neglect

1fsd1vx,CMV: Trump is basically a very successful cult leader and his followers are in a cult,"I'd like to believe this isn't the case, that there must be some sort of rational reason people continue following this guy, but the more I see the more skeptical I am. 

From my perspective, Trump has all of the bad qualities of a politician with none of the good. He's a pathological liar, he's obsessed with power (to the point where he wanted to stop counting votes when he was winning, despite numerous news sources explicitly saying there was a high possibility of a red mirage.) He keeps claiming voter fraud, but does not have enough evidence to get a case in front of a court. When the team picked by him- the cyber ninjas- counted the votes themselves they found *more* votes for Biden. 

I mean the list of stuff with this guy goes on and on. And in so many ways, he is like a dictator. His language- ""vermin"" ""poisoning the blood of this country."" I have never heard anybody say that except sociopaths and dictators (or, as often happens, a mix of both.)

Until recently, I believed there was no way people were in an enormous cult. And the idea that they are is terrifying, because history has shown that cult members will sacrifice a great deal for their leaders. But I really just do not see another explanation. 

It's terrifying to think that there might be such a large cult and what they might do after their leader loses. But I just don't see another explanation. But I hope somebody changes my view on this.

1ftufds,"CMV: CMV: Within legally recognized marriages, adultery should have clear, civil legal consequences, unless expressly agreed between spouses.","The legal concept of marriage, where spouses act as partners, is almost always built on mutual trust that certain aspects of the relationship, such as sex, are to be exclusive to the relationship unless agreed upon otherwise. Legally and financially rewarding spouses for betraying the trust of their spouse by allowing a cheating spouse to come out ahead in divorce undermines one of the key relationship dynamics in our society.

For the vast majority of people, entering into marriage is an explicit agreement that unless divorced or otherwise agreed upon, the people in the marriage will not have sex with or develop romantic relationships with other people. This should apply evenly to all genders, and if you view this as benefitting one over the other, it says a lot about your view on who may or may not be more likely to cheat.

Before I'm accused of being some kind of conservative or traditionalist: I have zero issue with any form of LGBTQ+ relationship or poly setup. I'm speaking strictly to traditional, legally recognized, monogamous marriages, which comprise the bulk of those in our society. I'm also not religious or socially conservative.

Heading off a few arguments:

1. ""The government shouldn't be involved in marriage""

Too late for that. Marriage is a legally binding agreement that affects debt, assets, legal liability, taxes, homebuying, and other fundamental aspects of our lives. The end of marriage has profound, legally enforceable consequences on both parties. It is also included in a pre-existing legal doctrine of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation\_of\_affections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affections).

2) ""But what if the spouses want to open their marriage?""

Totally fine. My post is in reference to the most common form of marriage, which is monogamous.

3) ""Adultery doesn't have a clear definition""

It does. ""voluntary sexual [intercourse](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=05826a3c56c67289&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1127US1127&q=intercourse&si=ACC90nwZrNcJVJVL0KSmGGq5Ka2Y_LZNCuz-rXf3RWbWGZD0YFuvQ0gck8iv_I-vXEsPMmDpeldPlTyUN0FJ6k9nx2_KAjj_QmEabPxsAQcdvs4E9R8NkyU%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_k-r92u2IAxVAMdAFHaqNGncQyecJegQIOhAO) between a married person and a person who is not his or her spouse."" ""Sexual intercourse"" would include all the commonly recognized forms of sex. This would have to be proven via the typical preponderance standard, which is greater than 50% odds, via typical evidence used to evidence behaviors - depositions/testimony under oath, any written or photographic evidence, circumstantial evidence, etc.

4) ""What should the legal consequences be?""

At the very least, immediate forfeiture of any rights to alimony or spousal support. Shifts in the default assumption of a 50/50 split of marital assets are another route to explore. Certainly not enough to leave anyone destitute, though.

5) ""What about children?""

Child support is a separate issue, as it affects the child, who has no say in one of their parents cheating on the other.",insect_ligaments,654,0.6800000071525574,1145,1727805246,2024-10-01 12:54:06,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ftufds/cmv_cmv_within_legally_recognized_marriages/,10,2024
1fuof4o,"CMV: Piracy isn't immoral, Nor is the damage from it as big as people make it out to be.","- ""If buying isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing.""

We've all heard this phrase countless times, and that's what i wanna dive into here. Companies have been and continue to get greedier by the second, and they've started to completely disregard people's conditions when it comes to acquiring a product. Streaming services deliberately serve you ads on their lower tier subscriptions in order to get you to upgrade (giving ads to paying customers is ridiculous), certain game stores have shit regional pricing or don't have it at all, game companies continue to include DRM software that damages the experience of the paying customers (cough cough, denuvo) and completely fucks up the experience of paying customers. Let's not even get into Nintendo and their abuse of the copyright system, i'll leave it for another post.

Not only is piracy these days not immoral, its actually the only way some people can acquire something they want to consume because they don't have a choice. So one could argue it ends up reaching people that would've otherwise just not consumed the product: You're not getting someone who can't buy a product to buy a product. But through pirating it they may become a potential customer. But lets digress a little.

So you, yeah, the person reading the post. Lets say you wanted to buy a game. Perhaps you'd use an online game store like epic games or steam, right? Now you own the game, and you can play it. Simple and convenient right? Except you don't own the game. If you, for any reason, get banned from the platform or lose access to your account you'll end up with either one of two things: an excruciating headache from trying to get it back or no games at all. Oh, you say you're a paying customer and you acquired everything legally? Sucks to be you! (You're also subject to the service's longevity, ToS changes, bugs, online authentication, bullshit DRM integration... I mean at least take me out to dinner before you f-- me like that-)

...Nah, for real though. The difference between getting games these days and lets say, 20 years ago, is that you actually owned the game physically. Unless you were using your CDs to cut bananas or something, you just need the game console and the CD. Nowadays you basically need to have everything online and completely depend on the company and be subject to their online authentication for various games before you can actually play them. Again, making the life of paying customers harder for no reason. 

If these companies are extremely rich and they keep buying out or getting rid of competition (cough cough nintendo), keep flipping the bird to the customers and push us to do exactly what they want once they've monopolized the market, how is piracy immoral? Doing anything about injustices legally will get you slapped around by big time lawyers and legal fees, so it is quite literally the only way that we have to rebel against these companies and make them change the way they behave. Your support ticket #2131321 is not changing shit, but speaking with your wallet surely will, especially if more people do it. Piracy isn't immoral, and it is purely a service issue. Its born out of the greed of streaming services and game companies. I guarantee it'd drop by an astounding 99% if they were to just fix the fucking way they operate, but they refuse to. So i say, sail the high seas and find that One Piece! Okay i need to stop... but anyways, change my view if there's something im missing here.

It draws attention to other places where the wall of standard/expected Dem support is cracking.

1fwyycs,"CMV: Trump and MAGA Didn't Drain the Swamp, they Became the Swamp","In 2016, the rally cry of MAGA was ""DRAIN THE SWAMP."" It was unapologetically anti-establishment and supported by frustrated people from all types of political slants. Whatever your thoughts about it overall, under that banner he won office.

Fast forward to 2020 and 2024, and the ""DRAIN THE SWAMP"" banner has been taken down (and probably burned out back) in favor of quotes from Trump like:

>“I’m for electric cars, I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly” at a rally in Atlanta, GA.

>""You’ve been waiting on a permit for five years; you’ll get it on Day 1"" Trump was quoted when speaking to oil execs in exchange for hefty donations.

These are just a few, flagrant ""quid pro quo"" style corruption scenarios which Trump seems **proud of**. Trump's pledges to take a ""hands on"" approach to interfering with interest rates sound like an antithesis of the 2016 MAGA mission statement. Trump's pledges to impose tariffs on all imports sound like an antithesis of the original 2016 MAGA mission statement. Trump's intention to bring Elon Musk, a silicon valley billionaire and enormous lobbying and dark money proponent, into his administration sound like an antithesis of the original 2016 MAGA movement.

My view is that the original MAGA movement died nearly as it began. It got Trump elected, and proved to be ""too hard"" to actually pursue beyond that. Trump and Co. realized it would be much easier to move into the swamp than try and drain it.

1fxdrrv,CMV: Elon Musk speaking at a Trump Rally in PA is the greatest gift you could possibly give to the Democratic Party. ,"As the title states. 

Just finished watching the Trump rally in Butler PA… and I am astounded by how out of touch and disconnected it was. 

Obviously, Elon Musk speaking at the event is going to be taking up most of the headlines covering this event. If I were a member of Kamala Harris’ team however, I would be ecstatic about this. 

A major narrative that her team has been trying to create is that a Trump presidency would mean more tax cuts and deferential policy directed towards the wealthiest members of society, all at the expense of everyday, working people. 

Based on this fact, it seems really counter-intuitive for the Trump campaign to openly play into this obvious talking point that the Harris team has created. Musk has been outspoken about his support on Twitter… but speaking at a Trump campaign rally is a MASSIVE change. 

What would be the rationalization to justify making this decision, which I view to be a complete mistake… Obviously Musk didn’t just show up, this was a coordinated campaign event. Seems really strange for both Musk (who’s car business has always been heavily dependent on Democratic support for electric vehicles) and Trump to make this decision so close to the election.

1fz6425,CMV: Presidential Debates should have LIVE Fact Checking,"I think that truth has played a significant role in the current political climate, especially with the amount of 'fake news' and lies entering the media sphere.

For example, I knew that there were no states allowing for termination of pregnancies after 9 months, and that there were no Haitian Immigrants eating dogs in Springfield Ohio, but the fact that it was it was presented and has since claimed so much attention is scary. The moderators thankfully stepped in and fact checked these claims, but they were out there doing damage.

In the most recent VP Debate between Walz and Vance, no fact checking was a requirement made by the republican party, and Vance even jumped on the moderators for fact checking his claims, which begs the question, would having LIVE fact checking of our presidential debates be such a bad thing? Wouldn't it be better to make sure that wild claims made on the campaign trail not hold the value as facts in these debates?

I am looking for the pros/cons of requiring the moderators to maintain a sense of honesty among our political candidates(As far as that is possible lol), and fact check their claims to provide viewers with an informative understanding of their choices.

1fz67ym,CMV: Haiti is not a failed state but a victim of colonization and revenge,"With the recent tragedies going on in Haiti due to gang violence and the assassination of the i president many people on this site have referred to the country as a failed nation and asked what could’ve happened to bring them to this state. I think this is an ignorant position that makes light of history.

Haiti was a slave nation where people who were stolen from Africa were traded and made to work under threat of violence rape castration lynching and murder. When they orchestrated one of the first major successful slave rebellion, pushing back the French, and allowing for the Louisiana purchase to occur they were not only not welcomed into the rest of the world but brutally punished and forced to pay back “reparations” to the French. 

The enslaved people of Haiti were forced to pay money to the people who killed, raped, and enslaved them and this debt was not paid off for 122 years. Under threat of warship they were told to pay back more than 10x the cost of the Louisiana purchase. The equivalent of 20-30 billion dollars.

Thomas jefferson worked to isolate Haiti diplomatically and strangle it economically, fearing that the success of Haiti would inspire slave revolts back home. Haitian success was perceived as a threat to slavery in America for decades, and the United States didn't officially recognize Haiti until 1862, as slavery began being abolished.

The United States  worked to isolate a newly independent Haiti during the early 19th century and violently occupied the island nation for 19 years in the early 20th century. While the U.S. officially left Haiti in 1934, it continued to control Haiti's public finances until 1947, siphoning away around 40% of Haiti's national income to service debt repayments to the U.S. and France.

This means that while other countries were taking advantage of the various and exponentially quick technological revolutions, Haiti was trying to pay its way out of a fictional and racist debt “owed” to slave holders at gunpoint. 

If you add on the effects of natural disasters and the earthquake as well as the fact their president was murdered by foreign mercenaries. It makes sense that they would be in this position, and they deserve empathy not the designation of a failed state.

1fzi81j,CMV: All transportation should be free out of evacuation zones. ,"Currently there is a massive problem with price gouging by airlines (supposedly now capped...) and it made me think...

If you are under a mandatory evacuation, you should not have to pay to evacuate. You are already likely going to lose your home. You may have no work to return to. You are limited in the possessions you can bring. And now you must also spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars just to leave? 

If an area falls under a mandatory evacuation and you live in that area, the government should be funding all of that. That should be part of FEMA to ensure everyone who has to evacuate doesn't need to worry about how. It would be easier and avoid fraud as well if we just did this up front instead of reimbursing people later. 

You tell the airlines ""there's a major hurricane how many people can you transport out of the area within X time"". Figure out how much it would cost. Create the guidelines for that many people. Do the same with trains and busses. If people are driving out (which should be a last resort because the more people who drive the more people who get trapped) the gas should be freely available. 

Any amount of ""fraud"" in a situation like this would be minimal. People will either pay to travel back or call it lost and stay put or travel somewhere else. You can coordinate with multiple airports/train/bus stations so that people get out of the hurricane zone to designated spots and they can either stay there or they can pay to travel somewhere else.

But they shouldn't have to worry about if they can afford to get out of the initial area. ",adhesivepants,5963,0.9300000071525574,610,1728444000,2024-10-08 22:20:00,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fzi81j/cmv_all_transportation_should_be_free_out_of/,10,2024

1fzrumy,CMV: The UN resolution calling for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories in 12 months shows the UN has no real interest in peace,"Just to preface: I'm an Israeli, I fully believe that a two state solution is the only way for peace and that eventually Israel will have to withdraw from the west bank.

Last month the UN general assembly passed a resolution calling for the complete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories in 12 months, among other things. This is obviously completely impossible for 2 main reasons -

1. Currently there are around 700K Israelis living in the west bank and transfering all of them out of there in a year is simply not doable. It's not like Israel has cities, houses and jobs ready to accommodate these people. The toll such a massive transfer of civilians would take on the economy and probably military is just too high for such a move to be realistic.

2. Israel cannot withdraw from the west bank before it is stable enough to not be threat to Israeli security. Pulling the army out of the west bank would leave Israel's heartland completely exposed to attacks from militants within the territory, something Israel simply can't allow to happen as it would majorly compromise the country's security. This is obviously the main reason why such a hasty, one sided withdrawal is impossible. 

This makes this resolution, in my opinion, detrimental to peace and not the opposite. 

This is because it's a resolution that Israel simply cannot accept. The consequences of this will be that many around the world and in Palestine will have the idea that Israel continuously ignores UN resolutions reinforced and Israel will garner even more hate for it. And in Israel it feeds straight into the ""UN and everyone is anti - semitic and can't be trusted"" narrative, which only strengths and emboldens the nationalists and drives people away from peace. 
I also thinks this leads the the UN becoming less credible as what's it's point if it is pushing out unrealistic resolutions? 

In my opinion if the UN truely cared about achieving peace they would adopt a resolution calling for Israel and the PA to restart earnest talks about adopting a 2 state solution, and the fact they instead adopted this one shows their interest isn't peace, but rather virtue signaling and optics.

We're reaching a tipping point where either homes become completely uninsurable or the insurance becomes so expensive that homes start losing value. 

This will precipitate a death spiral, where homeowners start to realize that buying or owning a home in Florida is not a good investment and they'll leave the state. Supply will increase as demand falls. 

I will add one caveat here and it's that the federal government could step in and rescue Florida through a subsidized insurance scheme, but the politics of this are really iffy. Republicans would be most incentivized to save the state, but such intervention is also against Republican orthodoxy.

1g016fw,CMV: Being pro-Palestine is not antisemitic,"I suppose most of this line of thinking is caused by the people who want to erase Israel from the map entirely along with its Jewish inhabitants which is as antisemitic as it gets, so to clear up, I mean pro-Palestine as in: against having innocent Palestinians barely surviving in apartheid conditions and horrified by 40 000 people (and other 100 000 injured) being killed and it being justified by many / most of the world as rightful protection of the state. I am not pro-Hamas, I can understand a degree of frustration from being in a blockade for years, but what happened on October 7 was no doubt inhumane... but even calling what's been happening over the past year a war feels for how one-sided is the conflict really feels laughable (as shown by the death toll).  
  
I browsed the Jewish community briefly to try to see another point of view but I didn't expect to see the majority of posts just talking about how every pro-Palestinian is uneducated, stupid, suspectible to propaganda and antisemitic. Without explaining why that would be, it either felt like a) everyone in the community was on the same wave-length so there was no need to explain or b) they just said that to hate on anyone who didn't share their values. As an outsider, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it's possible that I hold my current views because I'm ""uneducated"", I have admittedly spent only a relatively short amount of time trying to understand the conflict and I'm not very good with keeping historical facts without having them written somewhere... but again, I reserve my right to identify what goes against basic human principles because it shouldn't ever be gatekept, so I doubt any amount of information would be able to make me switch 180 degrees suddenly, but there is room for some nuance. 

Anyway, I'm assuming the basic gist is: being pro-Palestine > being anti-Israel > being anti-Zionist > being antisemitic (as most Jews are in fact Zionists). I find this assessment to having made a lapse of judgement somewhere along the way. Similarly to how I'm pro-Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza, I'm not anti-Israel / Jewish people, I am against (at least morally, as I'm not a part of the conflict) what the Israel government is doing and against people who agree with their actions. I'm sorry that Jewish people have to expect antisemitism coming from any corner nowadays, as someone who is a part of another marginalized community I know the feeling well, but assuming everyone wants me dead just fuels the ""us vs them"" mentality.

Russia and China both have stronger militaries and stronger espionage capabilities that are currently in use in the United States. Russia in particular has strong influence over US elections in a way that Iran just doesn't. Russia's attack of Ukraine is also more of an existential threat to the West and the United States alliances and strategic interests, but China's threat to Taiwan is also important, and even a conventional war with China would be disastrous for all parties involved. 

Iran doesn't have these kinds of capabilities, and is in part propped up by Russia, so even if we pretended that the US' most vital interests were in the Middle East (Which they aren't, and both Biden and Obama has wanted to get out of the region and refocus towards Asia), Iran is still largely a Russia proxy, indicating that the real threat is Russia. Iran has less than a fourth of the GDP of Russia and around half the population. Iranian proxies limited to the region, whereas Russia has proxies all around the globe and their influence extends into South America, putting them far more into the US' sphere of influence. What Iran is, is the greatest adversary of Israel, as it and its proxies operates primarily within Israel's sphere of influence while having a solely negative relationship with Israel (Whereas Russia, Iran's backer, has a more complicated relationship with Israel where they are not adversaries).

Naming Iran as the US greatest adversary is a conflation of the US interests with the interests of Israel.

I think the key word there is *inappropriate*. If someone is mocking or making fun of another culture, that’s cultural appropriation. But I don’t see anything wrong with adopting the practices of another culture because you genuinely enjoy them.

The argument seems to be that, because *X* people were historically oppressed for this hairstyle, you cannot wear it because it’s unfair.

There has even been (yet unverified) reports of a man being burnt alive due to a fire caused by secondary explosions and no evidence of any close by Hamas base. Even doctors without borders has verified this.

In Lebanon, buildings with babies and children are being destroyed and countless innocent lives are lost.

In the guardian, there have been reported of a 'very relaxed' approach to specific targeting - in order to bomb an area with a suspected low level Hamas operative, an exceptionally high level of 'collateral damage' is permitted. This is far different to Israel's previous strategies.

There have been, of course, many terrorists who have been killed. However, I do not believe this justifies the enormous amount of civilian casualties. If anything, this will achieve the opposite of their goals - any Gazan or Lebanese, after seeing their loved ones killed, will be radicalised against Israel even more.

Castle doctrine laws give individuals the right to use force, including deadly force, to defend themselves in their home without the duty to retreat.

Many states have some nuance with these laws but a lot of states have an overlap where they allow both of these to simultaneously exist. Texas for example has both.

This post is NOT arguing for one or the other but rather the fact that they both shouldn’t coexist.

If they coexist, it introduces a potential deadly threat to both law enforcement and the person defending their home and bystanders. In a scenario where law-enforcement gets a no-knock warrant and attempts to go through, the person can defend their home to this unknown intruder. This can of course lead to a gun fight.

My problem with this is that it incentivises schools to lie about grades and force students to graduate even if they are not ready simply to avoid state sanctions and possibly takeovers. This means the students themselves care less about their education because there are no consequences for performing poorly or not at all. The teachers will be forced by their admin to give them passing grades so that the school continues to look just good enough to avoid intervention. If students don't care to learn, they never will. There *must* be consequences for the students for performing poorly.

1g5y5nf,CMV: It Is Unwise for Supporters of Kamala Harris to Mock Undecided Voters ,"I was inspired to write this by an exchange I had regarding this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/s/E2Mj2dgkA8. As you can see the OP made a big hit. Over 1000 upvotes at the time I write this.

But take a second to consider the implications of that meme: it suggests that there are only two groups that exist in the American electorate —people who have decided to vote for Harris, and MAGA authoritarians. That’s it.

Now, I realize this was just a silly bit of fun, but I raised a question to other users on that heavily Democratic-leaning sub: is it wise to shame and ridicule people who still might vote for Kamala, especially considering that the election will almost certainly be decided by a extremely narrow segment  of the electorate? Does it make sense to mock undecided voters under these circumstances?

My concerns were met with scorn.

“I’m tired of swing voters! If they can’t figure out who to vote for, they should just stay home!”, said one.

“Swing voters don’t actually exist. They know they’re going to vote for Trump and just pretend to be undecided for attention.”, claimed another.

“I would hate to deny a person their right to vote but if a person can’t figure out why voting for Trump is bad…”

I am paraphrasing here, but only a little. What’s worse, I hear similar ideas from my progressive friends and I believe these opinions are common in left-of-center circles.

For example there was a post not too long ago right here on this sub where the OP expressed concern that Harris was not getting enough support from labor unions. I commented that the Democrats are increasingly becoming the party of the university educated managerial class and that they are losing wage earning workers in the process and I suggested that this was lamentable. Lots of people responded that the working class is mostly composed of bigots anyway so progressives shouldn’t seek their votes at all.

Now, that point of view is totally unhinged for a variety of reasons but I do want to say that I get why people are frustrated with swing voters.

Like, how can you be “not sure” about voting for or against a convicted criminal with authoritarian tendencies who endorses dictators and threatens civil rights? What kind of person would struggle with that decision?

But getting impatient is still not the appropriate response because despite what some Reddit users may believe swing voters are real.

There are people who voted for Obama, then Trump and then Biden and who have not made their mind yet about the 2024 election at this time. The key point for me is no matter how exasperating this kind of behavior might be, we need to try to coax these people to vote for our candidate and cannot afford to scoff at them publicly.

Statistically, swing voters are less educated and less politically engaged than hardcore supporters of either party, but they will decide the election. If a person does not want another Trump presidency, it is necessary to appeal to undecided voters. There simply aren’t enough Subaru Outback-driving, NPR-listening progressives (describing myself here) in the country—or in swing states—to carry the day for Kamala alone.

And like it or not, fair or not, there does exist a perception that Democrats are elitist college students and professors with nothing but sneering contempt for those without higher education. We can count on Trump and the Republicans to exploit that feeling to their advantage.

Making posts like the I referenced above exacerbates the problem. Even if it is at a micro level, the sentiment that undecided voters are stupid is widely spread and widely disseminated in progressive circles. And perception and feelings are more important than policy or facts right now, particularly for those “low information” voters who are going to decide whether or not Trump goes back to the Oval Office.

Under these conditions, I think a little tolerance and goodwill toward undecided voters makes strategic sense right now and I’m speaking to all of us who plan to vote for Kamala Harris.

Or maybe I’m wrong. Does it make sense to be openly scornful of swing voters right now?

I just want to say off the bat. Responses that say something to effect of, “What the Republicans do is even worse!” will not change my view. I don’t want the GOP to win so if they shoot themselves in the foot, I’m happy.

1g6vuts,"CMV: People who require that food be ""authentic"" to its cultural roots in order for it to be considered good are closed minded and have an unearned and illogical sense of superiority over other people's taste in food.","In my view, the only 3 things that truly matter with regards to food (in 99% of cases) are how the food tastes, how much it costs, and its nutritional value. Obvious exceptions to this general rule would be things like false advertising (restaurant advertises itself as ""authentic"" cuisine, but is obviously very far from being authentic to its cultural roots), or cultural events/festivals that are setup with the express purpose of celebrating a specific traditional culture. 

A classic example of my view is the friend or coworker we all seem to have who is 1/4 Italian, but has never been to Italy, and constantly talks about how terrible Olive Garden is because it isn't ""authentic"" Italian cuisine. This type of person is objectively closed minded, because they automatically write off anything that isn't exactly what they consider ""authentic"", no matter how much better the dish actually tastes compared to the authentic dishes they prefer. 

There is nothing about its proximity to traditional Mexican culture that somehow makes a traditional Mexican meal objectively superior to a San Diego-style Mexican dish or a New Mexican-style Mexican dish. 

If the only thing I knew about someone was that they automatically assume authentic traditional cuisine is better than modernized/Americanized/fusion style cuisine, then I believe they have a much higher statistical probability of being closed minded and having other illogical/nonsensical views, and thus I should automatically trust them less than I would trust another stranger who I know nothing about. I should especially trust them less when it comes to their opinions on art, travel, music, philosophy/ethics, and other endeavors where open mindedness is key to enjoyment and appreciation of said endeavor.

The THIRD is the one that made it’s way into English, because it rhymes, and because it is the only reasonable one—it doesnt call for the recolonization of a Palestinian state: From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free""—the translation of min an-nahr ʾilā l-baḥr / Filasṭīn sa-tatḥarrar

So there are three slogans used by entirely different demographic geographically, culturally, and ideologically. Israelis are connected to western media, but also the immediate Palestinian sentiments surrounding them. They hear all three of these slogans. This is the true disconnect between all of these peoples.

1g7c5b3,CMV: Black Lives Matter has been a failure,"Back in the 2010s, and especially in 2020, it seems like the Black Lives Matter was gaining strength. Videos of police brutality, especially against African Americans, became viral, and millions became outraged that this was so common in America. When George Floyd was murdered, millions justifiably took to the streets to protest against police brutality and racism. Politicians came out in support for police reform, and discussions on how to reform policing (from “how to make the police better” to “defund the police”) were all the rage.

But from 2021, it seems like everything took a complete 180. Crime skyrocketed during COVID (in part of police refusing to do their jobs in protest of BLM), causing the average American to support the police a lot more. Pro-police politicians like Eric Adams were elected while pro-BLM politicians like Chelsea Boudin were ousted from their positions.

Now, absolutely nobody talks about police brutality these days, not politicians nor the general public. But has the problem gone away? No! It has only gotten worse! 2023 has seen a record number of killings by police, and I don’t expect that number to go down in the future.

Unfortunately, rather than being addressed, police brutality has become like gun control. Someone being killed by police, even on live video, no longer elicits outrage. Instead, people will just give “thoughts and prayers,” shrug, and accept it as a fact of American life.

1g8zgxy,CMV: Malcolm X was correct about the white American liberal.,"I am not a conservative or a Trump supporter, I am simply tired of liberals now being seen as some kinf of ultimate good compared to the devils on the conservative side.

Malcolm x said that the White American who identifies as a liberal is the most ‘dangerous’ and ‘deceitful’ thing in the Western Hemisphere. He said that the issues concerning black Americans were raised by white liberals as part of a vicious power politics to get back at the white conservatives. In his own words, the liberals do so in order to gain power or retain power. 

This is fully seen in how the liberal of today talks about social justice and moral issues especially on Reddit. Issues that would traditionally be seen as important to liberals causes that affect minorities, and other contentious issues are thrown out the window as soon as it seems it may hurt the chances of a Democrat winning the election.

Malcolm said that conservatives are like wolves who make their intention to destroy you plain and compared liberals to foxes that hide their hand and plot when attempting to eat you. Many liberals on Reddit say things like if you even question Whether the democratic option is a good choice or matches your policies than you are aligned with fascism or don’t care about women/whichever other vulnerable demographic they can use as a card. This is manipulative and is reflective of Malcolm’s argument.

“The American negro is nothing but a political football and the white liberals control this ball. Through tricks, tokenism, and false promises of integration and civil rights…,” he remarked. Although he is talking about black people it applies to women, LGBTQ people, and more recently Arab communities. When it’s in fashion and low stakes, then it’s okay to criticize Israel for their crimes but when it’s election time we have to ignore all of their faults and behave as their #1 supporter.

1g9o244,CMV: An abortion ban will only create more human suffering,"Banning abortion is going to create a lot more suffering, especially for kids who end up in foster care. Right now, only about 20% of foster kids ever get adopted, which means the rest are stuck in the system until they either go back to their biological families or age out at 18. For the 20% who age out without a permanent family, life gets really tough. About 50% end up addicted to drugs, and 1 in 5 becomes homeless. For the boys, more than half end up in jail, and for the girls, about 70% are pregnant by age 21.

That’s a huge problem, and banning abortion is only going to flood the foster care system with more kids, which is already struggling to keep up. The system’s broken, and we know that kids who grow up in foster care are way more likely to end up in trouble—about 80% of people in prison spent time in foster care as kids.

So really, banning abortion isn’t just about babies being born—it’s about putting more kids into a system that can’t handle them and setting them up for a hard life. If we care about reducing suffering, pushing more kids into foster care is only going to lead to more addiction, crime, and pain for everyone.",AmbassadorFar4335,595,0.75,726,1729618719,2024-10-22 12:38:39,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g9o244/cmv_an_abortion_ban_will_only_create_more_human/,10,2024
1g9zjx6,CMV: Women who require men to pay/support them when dating are inherently going against feminism and equality movement and is extremely harmful to dating culture,"As the title states, I believe women that require the men to pay for them if they want to be in a relationship are inherently against the equal rights movement for women. I want to first clarify what I mean by ""paying for them"". A large notion of dating culture is that men are supposed to pay for dates, rents, bills, and financially support the women in order to be seen as a romantic partner and a real man. This belief directly goes against the idea of equal rights between genders as it infantilizes women. It also feeds into the stigma held by men against all forms of feminism that women only want equal rights when it benefits them as they want to have all the positive aspects of an equal relationship while also having the upside of having your entire life financed by your partner. I also believe that it is hypocritical to believe that you are in an equal relationship if you are being completely supported by your male partner. This belief also severely impacts dating for any men who are not in a financial state to be fully paying for another person. For example any low income groups, college students. It basically makes it seem like you have to be rich enough to ""buy"" a date and a relationship. I have heard the counter argument that feminism is about being able to choose to be in this type of relationship. Before I address this I want to be clear, if you want to be in a trad relationship, go for it, however you both people have to take the traditional roles. However, choosing to be financially supported while being in an equal rights relationship and while having your own career is essentially infantilizing yourself in the relationship. You are basically stating you want a ""father"" not a partner. This is the same version as men who make their partner do all the housework while the wife also has a career. In summary, I believe that women who want to be in a modern and equal relationship while having the men to support you financially are hypocrites. An equal relationship is one that splits finances, housework, and all other aspects of the relationship according to what makes sense to that relationship. This unequal relationship causes a lot of negative effects to overall dating culture",lordamir008,392,0.6800000071525574,669,1729649376,2024-10-22 21:09:36,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g9zjx6/cmv_women_who_require_men_to_paysupport_them_when/,10,2024
1ga8yqr,CMV: MLKs true message has been distorted in American history ,"Martin Luther king jrs true message and struggles have been flanderized into the equivalent of love thy neighbor, nonviolence, and I have a dream. These elements only describe a small part of who he was as a man and why his message still rings true today. 

Although people love to lampoon our modern activists as not being as good as MLK and being disruptive and engaging in criminal activity, this was the bulk of the civil rights movement and particularly MLKs strategy. He was a jailbird who was arrested numerous times and encouraged others to be jailed as well.

He didn’t just wish for the benefit of blacks and whites but for the allyship and solidarity of working class people of all colors as he recognized that we would never be free without being economically free, something that has still not come to pass and perhaps gotten even worse.

Recently protestors on college campuses were criticized for having outside agitators but MLK already spoke against this in the letter to Birmingham. 

“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial ""outside agitator"" idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.”

BLM protestors were criticized for being disruptive and rowdy, saying MLK only protested peacefully, but his protests were considered negatively as well. 

“You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.”

Malcolm X was criticized for speaking negatively on white liberals but MLK spoke on this as well in the same letter just replacing liberal with moderate.

“I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice”

He was a complex man and detractors against him want to say his message shouldn’t be accepted as he cheated on his wife with white women. These same people refuse to admit that this information was given to us by the corrupt FBI who followed and threatened him for years, tracking his every move and almost every word as if he was a terrorist. They even sent him letters pretending to be black people asking him to kill himself.

He was a believer in shutting down convenience even if he had to shut down a highway. He was an agitator and scholar and not just the I have a dream guy and now every street that bears his name is in the worst part of whichever city it’s in as the governments  honor to him.

1gac58g,CMV: Censorship within /r/WorldNews is dangerous,"/r/WorldNews is the largest subreddit on reddit, and controlling the narrative with permabans for widely supported views is dangerous and promotes a one sided story. It creates a self perpetuating echo chamber. 

I was permabanned instantly for saying that Israel is enforcing an apartheid. Something many extensive United Nations reports have concluded, along with the top respected humanitarian aid organizations, and the government of the country for whom the word was literally invented, South Africa. 

Being instantly permabanned for just agreeing and sharing a view with these organizations undermines any credibility for the largest subreddit, yet they are the dominant voice for international news on reddit. 

Whether you agree that for example Israel is upholding an apartheid is not the issue, it is the complete lockdown on what is able to be discussed on that subreddit.

1gangu3,CMV: The modern U.S. Republican party is a fascist party,"The word ""fascism"" gets thrown around as a slur nowadays, but it was a mainstream, popular movement for a good chunk of the last century. 

* Donald Trump's former chief of staff (Mark Kelly), along with the highest-ranked military officer who served under Trump (Mark Milley), have both said on-record that the leader of the Republican party [is a fascist](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-kelly-swinging-trump/story?id=115061457).
* A leading historian of fascism, [Robert Paxton](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/magazine/robert-paxton-facism.html) (paywall, sorry), recently adopted this view and said it goes beyond the party's leader: ""It's bubbling up from below in very worrisome ways, and that's very much like the original fascisms. It's the real thing. It really is.""
* Umberto Eco, who lived in fascist Spain, defined ""[Ur-Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur-Fascism)"" in a 1995 essay as a collection of attributes that pretty much match the modern Republican party. 

I don't personally know anyone who *self-identifies* as ""fascist"" in real life. But they are not hard to find on the internet. If you go to the largest neo-nazi site on the internet, which I won't link to for obvious reasons, you will see news stories that mostly resemble mainstream Republican talking points about how immigrants and Democrats are ruining America. While some self-identified fascists are sitting out the election, most seem to be voting Republican (and as far as I can tell exactly zero are voting for Democrats). 

One big difference seems to be that the Republican party isn't antisemitic while most self-identified fascists are. But I don't think the specific identity of the fascists' scapegoat group is vital to the definition.

1gbla2c,CMV: Elon Musk has most likely committed treason,"WSJ just dropped an article today, and it paints a pretty grim picture. 

Elon is deeply involved in the US space, defense and military industries and his companies receive billions in government contracts, yet he is getting chummy and regularly communicating with Putin and using Starlink to help Russia and hinder Ukraine. People in government are uncomfortable with it but the US government is painfully dependent on SpaceX. 

I wonder if his recent campaigning and fundraising for Trump is entirely to try to secure a pardon for potentially serious charges.

1gdcgv6,CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round. They are mistaken. ,"Two years ago in the UK, a new front in the culture wars opened up when large posters exclaiming [""Hey straight white men; pass the power!""](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYiLQixX0AEUK03?format=jpg&name=900x900) were spotted in various locations around its cities, as part of a taxpayer funded outdoor arts exhibition ran by an organisation by the name of 'Artichoke' - a vaguely progressive body aimed at making art more accessible to the public at large.

Evidently, the art was designed to generate discussion, and due to its front page news level controversy, on that level at least it was an astounding success: with the intended message clearly being that 'straight white men' have too much power, and they need to hand it over to people who are not 'straight white men', in order to, according to Artichoke's own mission statement at least, ""Change the world for the better"". 

Now this kind of sentiment - that 'straight white men' (however they are defined) are currently in power, and they need to step aside and let 'other people' (again, however they are defined) run the show for a while - is one that seems, to my mind at least, alarmingly common in liberal circles. 

See for example [this article](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lily-allens-right-white-males-9562356#ICID=sharebar_twitter), which among other things,  claims:

\>""It's white men who run the world. It's white men who prosecute the crimes, hand down the jail sentences, [decide how little to pay female staff,](http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/women-20s-paid-less-men-9560167) and tell the lies that keep everybody else blaming each other for the world's problems""

\>""It's white males, worldwide, who are causing themselves and the rest of the planet the most problems. It was white males over 45 with an income of $100,000 or more who [voted for tiny-fingered Donald Trump to run the free world](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-followed-emergency-kittens-9549099)""

Before finally concluding:

\>""Let me ask you this: if all the statistics show you're running the world, and all the evidence shows you're not running it very well, how long do you think you'll be in the job? If all the white men who aren't sex offenders tried being a little less idiotic, the world would be a much better place"".

And this, at last, brings us to the crux of my issue with such thinking. Because to the kinds of liberals who make these arguments - that it's white men who run the world, and are causing everyone else all the problems - could you please explain to me:

How many straight white men currently sit among the ranks of the Taliban, who don't merely decide ""How little to pay female staff"", but [simply ban them from working entirely,](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-07-07/an-afghan-woman-wanted-to-be-a-doctor-now-she-makes-pickles-as-the-taliban-restricts-womens-roles) among [various](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/26/taliban-bar-on-afghan-women-speaking-in-public-un-afghanistan) [other](https://amu.tv/129066/) [restrictions](https://medicamondiale.org/en/where-we-empower-women/afghanistan) ? 

How many straight white men currently govern countries such as Pakistan, Iran, and Thailand, where the kinds of crimes prosecuted involve [blasphemy (which carries the death penalty), ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68511557) [not wearing the hijab (which again, basically carries the death penalty)](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/16/iranian-woman-dies-after-being-beaten-by-morality-police-over-hijab-law), and [criticising the monarchy (no death penalty at least, but still 15 years in prison)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/thailands-lese-majesty-laws-explained-in-30-seconds#:~:text=Under%20article%20112%20of%20the,majesty%20%E2%80%93%20anywhere%20in%20the%20world) ? 

Or how many straight white men were responsible for ""blaming someone else"" for the problems of any of those [various countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_cleansing_campaigns#2000s) in which acts of ethnic cleansing have taken place, on the orders of governments in which not a straight white man sat? 

Indeed, the article preaches against the thousands of white men who voted for Trump -  ignoring the fact that more [Indians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_2019_Indian_general_election)voted for Modi's [far right](https://jacobin.com/2024/03/bjp-far-right-modi-india) BJP, than there are white men in America \*at all\*!

Now; again, I must stress. NONE of the above is to say that straight white men have never restricted the rights of women, passed overbearing laws, or persecuted minorities. Of course they have; but surely it is more than enough evidence to show that NONE of those behaviours are exclusive to straight white men, and so simply demanding straight white men step down and ""Pass the power!"" is no guarantee of a progressive utopia-  when so many countries not run by straight white men are \*far\* from such? Moreover; does it not also suggest that ideology is NOT dictated by race, and therefore asserting that we can judge how progressive -or regressive- one's politics are simply by skin tone is ludicrous? 

Indeed, the whole idea that 'straight white men' exisit as a political collective at all seems frankly baffling to me; many liberals ironically seem to know the difference between Bernie Sanders/Jeremy Corbyn and Donald Trump/Boris Johnson (delete as nationally applicable) very well, and if straight white men do act in such a collevtive spirit, as liberals often allege, then how in high heaven did England have a series of [vicious civil wars, driven in part by religious sectarianism,](https://www.britannica.com/event/English-Civil-Wars) at a time when nearly every politician in the country was straight, white and male?!

Indeed; while we're back with the UK - even if all such people did step down, and hand over their power, we would still find a great deal of conservatism in the ranks of our politics; we may even find non white MPs standing up and demanding the [recriminalisation of homosexuality](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law), or even [persecution for apostasy.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34357047) Yes, many ethnic minorities are more likely to vote for ""progressive"" parties (Labour in the UK, the Democrats in the US), but this clearly does not translate to political progressivism on their own individual part. 

Now, a counter argument to my view here may be; ""But are you not cherry-picking the worst examples? Why do you not look at those non-white societies which, presently or historically, have been more progressive?"".

And I concede; ancient India may have been more accepting of homosexuality and gender fluidity than was the norm in (white) Europe - as were several Native American nations. But this too ignores the fact that, as today, non white societies in the past also ran on a spectrum of progressive to conservative: certain Native American societies might well have been gender egalitarian, even matriarchies - but many of the Confucian states in East Asia (particularly China) were perhaps even more patriarchal than was the norm in Europe. Indeed, they were certainly as apt at [warfare](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/atrocity-and-genocide-in-japans-invasion-of-korea-15921598/7EFEAB40BC9D61D2F9E92CF8C506FB70), [genocide, ](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/qing-extermination-of-the-zunghars/6D038CADD0F808459451175C1CAD6DC5)and [ethnic persecution.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/viet-nam-and-the-genocide-of-champa-14701509/6E8490A4C5670883A94DAD24BF5C899A)

All of which is to say, finally reaching my conclusion, in which (I hope!), I have effectively stated my case:

History, foreign politics, and even the attitudes of minorities within 'white' majority countries all suggest that there is no correlation between skin tone and political belief - and it is FAR MORE important to listen to what people actually believe, rather than lazily assume ""Oh, you have X skin tone, therefore you must believe Y, and surrender your power to Z who will make the world a better place than you"". 

Again, the argument I am making here is NOT that there should be \*only\* straight white men in politics, or that non white men are inherently \*worse\* at politics - I am well aware that there are many extremely progressive POC, as there are many extremely progressive white men. 

Rather, I argue exactly the opposite; that liberal identity essentialism is entirely in the wrong, and no one group of people are any inherently more progressive or conservative than any other - thus, simply removing one group from power is no guarantee of achieving progressive causes. 

I stand of course to be proven incorrect; and will adjust my view as your thoughts come in!",TenTonneTamerlane,1156,0.7300000190734863,792,1730040057,2024-10-27 09:40:57,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gdcgv6/cmv_certain_sects_of_liberals_believe_that_simply/,10,2024
1gdi4gm,CMV: Allowing children to become morbidly obese is child abuse. ,"As the title states, parents that allow their children to become morbidly obese are abusing them and should be treated as abusive parents. That includes CPS involvement and possibly loss of custody. 

In regards to the type of abuse, I believe that allowing a child to be some obese falls under “neglect.” Neglect occurs when a person responsible for the care of another person does not provide needed care or leaves them without care. In this instance, the parents are not providing the needed care, which I believe is a healthy diet/exercise regiment needed to maintain a healthy weight. 


While I think that enabling obesity could also be categorized as physical abuse because it causes bodily injures, I think that this falls short of the definition of physical abuse because there is a lack of direct physical contact by the abuser. With that said, I am open to a different opinion on this point as it could be argued that the physical symptoms of allowing a child to become obese is still physical abuse even if the abuser doesn’t inflict the injury with direct bodily contact. 

So how should this abuse be addressed by officials? First, CPS should be involved and allowed to investigate the reasons behind a child’s morbid obesity. If it does result from neglect, then the parents should have to work with professionals to address the issue. The cost of this care would be dependent upon the families financial situation. Failure to do so, and or failure to improve the child’s weight would result in a loss of custody. 

Maybe this is just crazy? Change my view.

1gehf05,CMV: Muslims and the Qu'ran itself have too many non-democratic and unacceptable standpoints to be supported in secular western countries,"Before saying anything else, I'm going to tell you that most of my viewpoints are based on empirical evidence that I and those around me have collected over the past years and not on looking deeper into muslim culture and reading the Qu'ran, which I'm planing to do at a later point.

I live in Germany, in a city that has both a very large support for homosexuality and the lgbtq community, as well as a large amount of muslims. An overwhelmingly large amount of the muslims I met in my life have increadibly aggressive views on especially the lbtq-community and jewish people, constantly using their religion as reasoning for their hatred. I know that this problem isn't exclusive to Islam, but christians tend to have a much less aggressive approach to these topics because of principles like charity and taking a hit to the other cheek. Muslims on the other hand oftenly take a much more aggressive approach, presumably because of their principles of an eye for an eye and the high importance of the jihad. 

Furthermore, people from muslim countries tend to be harder to immigrate than almost all other cultures, because of their (depending on the school) strict religious legislation on the behavior of women, going as far as women not being allowed to talk to any people outside, leading to generations of people not even learning our language and never socialising with the native germans at all, in spite of many (free) possibilities to do so. Many also oppose the legitimacy of a secular state and even oppose democracy in general, because it doesn't follow the ruling of their religion, which emphasizes that only muslim scholars should rule the state. 

While I tried to stay open to most cultures throughout my life, I feel like muslims especially attempt to never comprimise with other cultures and political systems. Not based on statistics, but simply my own experience in clubs and bars in cologne (the city I live in), the vast majority of fights I've seen happen, have been started by turkish or arab people. I've seen lots of domestic violence in muslim families too and parents straight up abondening and abusing their children if they turned out to be homosexual or didn't follow religious rulings.

I know that this problem isn't exclusive to Islam, but barely any other culture is so fierce about their views. I'm having a hard time accepting and not opposing them on that premise.

Nonetheless, I feel like generalization is rarely a good view to have, so I hope some of you can give me some insight.

1gepnua,CMV: There is very little evidence that ethnic diversity is actually economically beneficial for a company,"First a disclaimer, I am not against ethnic diversity. I am neutral/slightly positive towards the diversity campaigns for ethical reasons. However, company trainings provide you with information like ""most diverse companies are 40% more likely to outperform compared to least diverse ones"" and I just don't feel that these claims of massive economic benefits actually hold water.

Vast majority of these claims seem to stem from the famous McKinsey diversity reports. However, these reports  are documented to have [issues with reverse causality and they have proven to be very difficult to replicate](https://econjwatch.org/File+download/1296/GreenHandMar2024.pdf?mimetype=pdf).

Scrolling Scopus or Google Scholar actually reveals a lot of fairly recent articles, in more reputable journals than the one linked above, which do not find any correlation whatsoever apart from rather localized areas or find a negative one (examples: [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292113001670?casa_token=9_YjMecwRV0AAAAA:hBP-bZf8z1T8v4DR_3UOy4Yh9oJuMNfjYovgaWPXHzjEgb09g1Zu0zledGJYYQraWlBpRA0YB1E), [2](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/103/3/521/97644/Ethnic-Diversity-and-Growth-Revisiting-the)).

This is simply not how a consensus in a field looks like. I am a layman, so I am not going to go as far as taking my stance on which side is right. But the evidence about positive economic impact of ethnic diversity seems quite doubtful and highly contested to say the least.

Hence, I find it quite insulting to be fed this on company trainings. Why don't they rather tell me that they want diversity, because they believe it is right? Trying to sell it on a tentative indication that it is good for business looks bad.

Change my view!

edit: to change my view, I would like to see some solid piece of evidence which confirms these major benefits or a nice explanation why it must be true, ideally with some example (but not just 'more viewpoints are always better', because I find that very abstract and not necessarily valid).",Downtown-Act-590,462,0.7099999785423279,241,1730190280,2024-10-29 03:24:40,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gepnua/cmv_there_is_very_little_evidence_that_ethnic/,10,2024
1gewuha,CMV: Dating preferences shouldn’t be considered wrong for people to have ,"This is mostly a social media thing but social media makes it’s way into real life. I’ve noticed over the years people have been against certain preferences, and to me I don’t see a problem with having preferences in your dating life. As long as you aren’t saying people who aren’t your preference are objectively less than, and we can admit that everyone has their own taste. I’ve seen people say if you wouldn’t date someone at all it’s a requirement not a preference, and to that I do agree but preference is kind of a euphemism many times in this case

But if someone only dates white people, let them who cares. It doesn’t affect anyone else, as long as they don’t shit on other races. If someone doesn’t wanna date fat people, then so what? As long as they aren’t insulting people who cares? If someone doesn’t wanna date a person with a high body count or who is a SW, as long as they don’t talk down on those people. I may only like chocolate icecream and never eat vanilla, but that doesn’t mean I’m going around hating vanilla it means I wouldn’t eat it myself.

Also I see a lot of people have an issue with this because they view it as a prejudice, and in a way dating is inherently predjudice but people feel like it shouldn’t be towards things someone can’t change. But this obviously isn’t the case. Plenty of people say they want a “smart” partner, but people can’t change their IQ. If you want a partner with similar interests to you is that fair if someone can’t control what’s interesting to them or not? Dating is inherently judging someone to see if they meet your standards of dating and there’s nothing wrong with that as long as your judgements don’t go past would I personally want to be in a intimate relationship with this person.",Accomplished-Fix1204,314,0.6899999976158142,761,1730214400,2024-10-29 10:06:40,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gewuha/cmv_dating_preferences_shouldnt_be_considered/,10,2024
1gf1rtc,CMV: Being ugly is really detrimental to your life experience ,"I feel like I’m living life as an outcast. I grew up being bullied and picked on and I used to think it was luck that I used to experience it, but it didn’t stop in my adult life, if anything it got worse. I had big teeth that took years to fix, and very bad acne. This was changeable during my early years. But my facial appearance and my height are not.

I notice how people treat me, especially at work in environments full of people against someone who is very physically attractive, and it’s like night and day. 

It’s much harder to form relationships and much harder to get the opposite sex to be attracted to you. I don’t blame women for feeling unattracted to me either, because I would probably feel the same way.

People who say ‘beauty is within the eye of the beholder,’ have never truly experienced life as an unattractive person. Because if you were unattractive, you wouldn’t say this.

I’ve been alone for most of my life, and jobs have been much harder to hold down, friends have been harder to keep. 

It annoys me that we live in a time of promoting obesity on beauty magazines, especially for women, and especially when this is something within someone’s control. Someone’s height and face are not easily changed without plastic surgery which is extremely expensive and not to mention unnatural and sometimes even dangerous.

 I feel like my life experience would never compare to someone who is physically attractive. It feels like life is a chore rather than something to be enjoyed, all because of genetically factors that are completely outside of my control. No matter how much someone tells me ‘I’m blaming women for why they are not attracted to me’ or ‘you need to love yourself first,’ will ever change what it is like to have an unattractive face and to actually have to live with it.

I cannot disagree more. Its the lack of actual diversity thats hurting the industry. Real diversity is arguments, different view points, tension, and showing that were different. Take Dragon Age: Origins. In that game it shows how elves are considered second class citizens to humans and the discrimination they face. That is diversity that builds to the lore and feels human, because diversity shouldn't be ""everyone gets along"". It should be ""even if we are completely different and im supposed to hate you we can still be friends."" It should be that we can have different view points yet still all work together.

1gh8oh6,CMV: There is nothing inherently wrong with losing weight via Ozempic & similar drugs,"(this argument assumes there is no scarcity for the drug, and that me using it would not prevent others from having access to it or raise prices)

If the health issues due to obesity are greater than the side effects of ozempic then the patient should take ozempic. There has been a tremendous amount of hate for this drug from both extremes of the ""fatphobia"" spectrum. On one side you have the extreme anti-fatphobia crowd that thinks ozempic is bad because there is nothing wrong with being fat, and on the other end you have those who genuinely hate fat people thinking ozempic is wrong because you should have to lose weight the old fashioned way.

Most people sit somewhere in the middle on that spectrum. So do I. Drugs are neither good or bad. All that matters is their effects, and ozempic has shown astonishing clinical results in weight loss. Think most people would agree obesity is a big public health issue in our society (or maybe that's a CMV for another day). I don't think it's morally wrong to be fat, but I don't think it's good for you.

Personally I want to stop being fat for both health and aesthetic reasons, and I don't think that should be moralized. While it is not a huge priority in my life right now, I'd love to go on ozempic if it could help me lose weight. If I lost some weight it would be so much easier to be active and live a genuinely healthy lifestyle. And I would feel better about myself. I don't see what the big deal with ""doing it right"" is. I acknowledge that there are some side effects but those side effects pale in comparison to the hit to my quality of life caused by obesity. I have tried many many times to lose weight ""the right way"" to no avail. I have since learned to feel okay in my body, but tbh I would be a lot more comfortable if I were 100lb lighter. (26yo 6'4"" 350lb male for anyone who needs to know). As I get older my weight is going to affect my life span. If going on ozempic could add years and quality to my life why shouldn't I use it?

I know a lot of people will say ""it could have side effects we don't know about yet,"" but I don't find that convincing. *Everything* could have side-effects we don't know about yet. Being obese has side effects I *do* know about and experience right now. I view this argument the same as I view anti-vax arguments: the FDA's drug screening process is a lot more reliable than my unscientific intuition.

Edit:

On the argument ""when you stop taking it you'll gain the weight back""

I would be willing take it forever. And even if I couldn't, I just want to be healthy and active while I am young at least for a little while. My chance to do that is slipping away.

I haven't been a healthy weight since before puberty. I have never been athletic. I want to try sports and actually be good at them. I want to be able to run without shame and pain. I want to feel good when I look in the mirror. Even if it's temporary I want just a little time like that.

This argument alone cannot be dispositive. Being healthy for a little while and then going back to being fat is better than having been fat the whole time.

Edit 2:

I find it hilarious that I have explained multiple times how I managed to lose weight and keep it off when I lived in a different country with conditions that made it easier to make healthy choices and instead of trying to help me find solutions based on what has already worked, many brilliant health experts in the comments are suggesting ""no, ignore that. Keep everything in your life exactly the same but just start doing diet and exercise. You lack the willpower? Well stop it you silly goose. It's actually easy if you aren't such a pathetic loser.""

1gingrk,"CMV: Homeschooling is at best moderately, and at worst severely damaging to a child.","Academically, even with access to curriculum supports, almost all parents are going to struggle to provide a comprehensive education in all subjects to the level a public school would. Even if the parent has a strong academic background, they will be missing elements of other subjects or of pedagogy in general. They may struggle to fully identify progress or gaps in learning that go on to multiply in the subsequent years.  
  
Beyond academics, a key function of school is the social aspect - to expose young children to their peers and social scenarios both positive and negative for them to navigate in preparation for adulthood. You can try to supplement this with playgroups, team sports, etc. to some extent, but you're not going to replicate the nature or frequency of school relationships.

Finally, the fact that the majority of their peers will have these common experiences will leave them perpetually feeling like an outsider, even once school is well behind them.

All of the above leads to believe homeschooled students are being done a disadvantage by parents who insist on it, usually for self-serving, insular reasons, or to ensure they are not taught aspects of the curriculum they disagree with. Anecdotally, I have several friends who were homeschooled (only until high school) who either express regrets of their own, or showcase social or academic deficiency as a result; I am sure the negatives outweigh the positives.",Rome_Leader,1012,0.7400000095367432,681,1730642388,2024-11-03 07:59:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gingrk/cmv_homeschooling_is_at_best_moderately_and_at/,11,2024
1giv72i,CMV: There is no such thing as an ethical billionaire.,"This is a pretty simple stance. I feel that, because it's impossible to acquire a billion US dollars without exploiting others, anyone who becomes a billionaire is inherently unethical. 

If an ethical person were on their way to becoming a billionaire, he or she would 1) pay their workers more, so they could have more stable lives; and 2) see the injustice in the world and give away substantial portions of their wealth to various causes to try to reduce the injustice before they actually become billionaires. 

In the instance where someone inherits or otherwise suddenly acquires a billion dollars, an ethical person would give away most of it to righteous causes, meaning that person might be a temporary ethical billionaire - a rare and brief exception.

Therefore, a billionaire (who retains his or her wealth) cannot be ethical.

1gjysh4,CMV: Lottery games with misleading odds should be illegal,"I'll give you a simplified example. 

A lottery game was advertised as $1 for ticket that is printed out of the machine at the time of purchase. The game was advertised as ""If your number matches our number. You win the prize"". The numbers can be 1 through 45.

So the advertised logic is that you have a 1 out of 45 chance to win.

I bought the ticket and lost.

So after looking online for several minutes, I found an obscure PDF file with the real odds. You have a 1 out of 500,000 chance to win.

How it works is it does a 1:500000 random number generation and if it decides you win, then it prints the ""winning number"" as the number you picked. Otherwise it randomly picks any of the other 44 losing numbers and puts that as the ""winning number"". 

To me, that is straight up fraud. 

It would be the equivalent of me telling you to guess a coin flip, but written on the bottom of my foot is a ""rule"" that lets me flip the coin to the opposite of whatever you picked 499,999 times out of 500,000. Then blaming you for not checking the bottom of my foot.
This fraud has become so commonly accepted that people blame you for taking their game's advertised rules at face value.

This is how the printable EzMatch and Scratch Off tickets work.

All the ""games"" and ""rules"" are obfuscation to hide the fact that the odds are astronomically higher than the known games they advertise (Bingo, 7-11-21, Lotteria, Number Matching, Monopoly, etc). 

The matching numbers they list are also irrelevant since they don't have ANY relevance to whether a ticket is a winning one or not. The numbers are just a façade to fraudulently think that the odds of winning are significantly higher than they really are. 

BTW, the tickets are in the machine with only the front facing so you can't read the back. Also the back contains ZERO information about the real odds. Instead it has a single line of small text that says ""visit the website for the rules"". That is only available after you've bought the ticket. 

Convince me that it isn't fraud to advertise ""games"" with ""rules"", but games and rules advertised don't matter because theres a second hidden set of rules that make you lose way more.",Random-Gif-Bot,322,0.8700000047683716,218,1730781615,2024-11-04 22:40:15,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gjysh4/cmv_lottery_games_with_misleading_odds_should_be/,11,2024

For context, I grew up in Iran around Shia Muslims. Most of the people around me identified as Muslim in name, but many didn’t strictly follow the religion, and some even despised it. Personally, I hold a very critical view of Islam.

From my perspective, Islam promotes outdated, unhealthy, and often bigoted ideas. While I know not all Muslims follow these beliefs to the letter, these aspects are deeply rooted in the ideology. A few examples I find concerning:

* Islam often promotes misogynistic beliefs that limit women’s freedom.
* It teaches intolerance towards homosexuals and apostates.
* It encourages violence against its enemies and places a strong emphasis on martyrdom and military supremacy.
* The goal of Islam, as stated in its texts, is to dominate the world as the true religion.

1gk7ekw,CMV: It is okay to criticize Non-Western traditionalism,"I feel like a lot of left-wingers are stuck in the mindset, that Non-Western cultures are inherently less oppressive and more free than Western cultures, even though they are much more conservative than Western ones. American right-wing Christians have much more in common with Conservative Muslims than they think, compared to Atheist Progressive people. It is just they use the same tactics in controlling societies, but they happened to be in different teams.

It is just happened, that Non-Western traditionalists don’t have political power to have influence in Western politics and install their supremacy, so they fall into the category of oppressed ones, however the left-wingers fail to realize, that they are not their ideological allies. In fact they will oppose Western equality until they will have the right to install their rules. 

I have no idea, how Western societies can tolerate their traditionalism as the culture, if it is inherently oppressive. For the same rules we can perceive culture of some hardcore weird Christian sects of Deep South, like Quiverfull, their own culture, but we are aware, that this Deep Southerner Christian culture is really bad for USA as a whole and it would be better, if it was disbanded. I am aware, sone of y’all will say, that they don’t have a culture etc, however mostly it is political instrument to fight against these cultures rather than a correct statement (I also hate Christianity too).

Especially, i see this problem with Non-Western men rather than with Non-Western women. Non-Western women actually care about relationships between different groups and collective callout of bigotry, while retaining their culture in more ecological ways, while Non-Western men tend to be hypocrites in using only anti-racist rhetoric against White racists (who they actually share most of core beliefs with, but they are in different teams), while actively participating in sexism and homophobia, defending their actions with “muh these are our traditions” shield.

We responded by saying that women don’t want to listen to men’s problems. Their response was that women’s issues are more important because they have been historically wronged by society. The basic contention they proposed was that women face more oppression and a slew of issues fighting against the patriarchal society that we would never be able to understand.

1gl5345,"CMV: Most reddit mods are biased and remove/leave content which they personally disagree/agree with, despite it violating/not violating the rules of the subreddit.","Alright, let’s talk about something I’ve noticed happening on Reddit.   
  
Moderators there are supposed to be impartial, right? They’re tasked with enforcing rules fairly, keeping things balanced, and making sure discussions stay open for everyone. But lately, it seems like some moderators are letting personal beliefs influence what stays and what goes.   
  
They’re picking which posts stay visible based on whether they agree with them or not, which can feel unfair to a lot of users. Sometimes, posts that are technically against the rules are allowed to stay up if they fit a certain narrative. And other times, posts that don’t break any guidelines get removed because they don’t align with a particular perspective. This inconsistency in enforcement can lead to a sense of unfairness for a lot of users who feel like the playing field isn’t even.   
  
What I am seeing as a result is that Reddit is turning into more of an echo chamber in certain spaces. Many subreddits tend to show only one side of a conversation, one perspective. If you’ve got an opposing opinion, or you want to question the main views in those subs, it’s tough to have your voice heard.  


Take r/pics for example, we know that it got so much bad rep for political posts throughout the 2024 US Presidential Election cycle, I mean all of you who are active on that subreddit saw how we had 10s of posts everyday where embarrassing pictures regarding the two candidates were shared.   


But I saw that the posts which were against Donald Trump (Republicans) got 1000s of upvotes and comments. While the ones against the Democrats, got removed by mods there fairly quickly. Even though the posts did not break any rule.  
  
I believe this kind of moderation is harmful to free speech and people deserve a chance to share their perspectives in an open forum and feel confident that the rules are applied the same way to everyone.   
  
That said, I’m open to changing my mind on this. If there’s a valid reason why this approach to moderation is necessary or if someone can make a solid case for how it’s ultimately better for the community, I’m all ears.

No I don’t think people from Muslim countries or Muslims are inherently evil or that religion in general is stupid.

One of the trends we can see in the last decades is that islamist extremism and terrorism is on the rise. Even in Europe which tended to be becoming more atheist and liberal Christian in the last decades. This has given right wing populist an extremely successful target and led to the success of right wing parties in recent years.

Liberal party’s were to scared that they seemed racist if they even addressed problems related to Islam which is a thing that still baffles me because textbook Islam(like many religions) is inherently anti feminist and homophobic so one would assume that liberal party’s would try to protect women’s and queer rights/safety.

1gly6bc,CMV: Terms Like 'Incel' Prove That We Reduce People's Worth to Sexual Success,"Let’s start with the term “incel,” which often reduces a person’s value to whether they succeed in the dating world. I think this is a narrow view. After all, it overlooks bigger struggles, like isolation and the lack of meaningful relationships, which are real issues. When we focus only on sexual success, we miss the chance to understand deeper emotional needs and human dignity.

Indeed, not all men who identify as “incels” (or are labeled as such) see others as mere objects for sex. However, the culture around the term often promotes (and proves) a transactional view of relationships, where human connections are reduced to something that validates someone’s identity. In my opinion, this directly takes away from the true depth and respect that relationships should have.

Of course, misogyny, toxic masculinity, and objectifying women are serious problems, no doubt. But I think the bigger issue is that society struggles to understand human dignity. We need to see each other as whole, multi-dimensional people, not as objects to conquer or manipulate. Respect should come from this deeper recognition.

Yeah, relationships are naturally complicated, and we all want intimacy and connection. But they shouldn’t be seen as transactions, where someone’s worth is based only on what they can give in return.

In the end, I believe that sexual success should never define a person’s worth or the health of a relationship. So, when society overemphasises it, we set up unrealistic expectations, frustration, and lose sight of the emotional bonds that make relationships last.

Consequently, societal expectations impact relationships, but we need spaces where people can connect authentically, without pressure to meet shallow standards. The goal isn’t to eliminate all expectations but to shift the focus away from appearances or sexual success and make room for genuine, meaningful connections.",borisdandorra,673,0.6399999856948853,732,1731006127,2024-11-07 13:02:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gly6bc/cmv_terms_like_incel_prove_that_we_reduce_peoples/,11,2024
1glymqm,"CMV: As a European, I find the attitude of Americans towards IDs (and presenting one for voting) irrational.","As a European, my experience with having a national ID is described below:

The state expects (requires) that I have an ID card by the age of 12-13. The ID card is issued by the police and contains basic information (name, address, DoB, citizenship) and a photo.

I need to present my ID when:

* I visit my doctor
* I pick up a prescription from the pharmacy
* I open a bank account
* I start at a new workplace
* I vote
* I am asked by the police to present it
* I visit any ""state-owned service provider"" (tax authority, DMV, etc.)
* I sign any kind of contract

Now, I understand that the US is HUGE, and maybe having a federal-issued ID is unfeasible. However, what would be the issue with each state issuing their own IDs which are recognized by the other states? This is what we do today in Europe, where I can present my country's ID to another country (when I need to prove my identity).

Am I missing something major which is US-specific?

1gnxluh,"CMV: We are producing Lost Boys in factory-like quantities, and the price will be astronomical","The hustle economy isn’t building anything sustainable; it’s hollowing out young men from the inside, encouraging them to project a flimsy brand rather than develop genuine value. And while everyone’s waving the flag of empowerment or self-actualization, all they're actually doing is exploiting a generation starving for direction, identity, and validation—otherwise known as the Lost Boys. 

>The Lost Boys Phenomenon: Disposable Youth

For the past two decades, we’ve been cultivating an entire demographic of disillusioned young men—educated in classrooms that devalue them, raised in families that are increasingly unstable or absent, and sent into a society that neither needs nor respects them. Despite the hand-wringing articles, neither side of the ideological divide cares about solving this problem; both are too busy pushing their own shallow narratives. On one hand, society shames these men as “overgrown boys” who avoid responsibility; on the other, it calls them “toxic” or dangerous if they express traditional masculinity. It’s a catch-22: no role models, no roadmap, just isolation and contradiction. Enter the Hustle Economy. It's the lifeline dangling in front of these young men. Except it’s not a lifeline; it’s a noose.

>Hustle Culture: The Mirage of Influence

In the hustle economy, brand trumps substance every time. Fame, however hollow, is currency. Validation, however fleeting, is dopamine. But here's the reality: we’ve created a system where ""influence"" is a simulacrum of achievement, where image and validation replace any real development of skills or character. Young men aren’t learning to create, innovate, or lead; they’re learning how to project a hollow image. They’re being conned into thinking that the *performance* of success is the same as success itself. Today, any Lost Boy can be a “thought leader” by spewing someone else’s platitudes into an algorithm and watching the numbers roll in.

But it’s all smoke and mirrors. The influencers and gurus selling the fantasy of the hustle economy—personal brands, online courses, or lifestyle tips—are the biggest hustlers of all. They’ve perfected the art of selling air, and they’re pulling these young men into their orbit by promising a quick path to purpose, self-worth, and financial success. What’s the result? It’s a generation of men seeking identity in follower counts and purpose in the next “grind,” never realizing they’re burning out their very souls for a temporary high that leaves them emptier each time.

> The Brand of Me: Identity in Freefall

Here’s the truth: we’ve so deeply intertwined personal identity with brand identity that young men now equate their self-worth with the size of their online following. It’s a vicious cycle. The hustle economy feeds insecurity by tying self-worth to fleeting metrics. Today, being a “man of substance” means being a man with influence, with likes, with numbers. No one cares what you do if no one can see it. And the problem with that? It’s a treadmill. When followers are your identity, you can’t afford to stop. When money is your validation, you can’t afford to fail.

This is what we're teaching them: that the projection of value is more critical than actual value, that growth is measured in clicks, not character. It's creating a generation of men who are as disposable as the metrics they chase. When numbers inevitably decline, when the brand fails to pivot, they’re left with nothing. And the cycle repeats, chewing up the next wave of Lost Boys looking for someone—anyone—to show them what it means to be worth something.

>The Hustle Economy: Grifters Teaching Grifters

These “gurus” and “coaches” know exactly what they’re doing: they’ve created an economy that preys on the desperate, selling hope in the form of clickbait aspirations. Each influencer, each “life coach,” each self-proclaimed expert is making bank by leveraging the vulnerabilities of the Lost Boys, who are seduced by the promise of easy money, fame, and—let’s be honest—female validation. The young men they’re targeting don’t know any better, because no one taught them anything better. They’re sheep without shepherds, and the only “guidance” they’re receiving is coming from people who are just looking to turn a profit on their insecurities. 

And let’s be clear: there’s no real value in what’s being sold. Hustlers aren’t innovating; they’re replicating the same playbooks, the same formulas, the same lies, and branding it as something revolutionary. They’re conning young men into buying courses, joining mastermind groups, and “leveling up” their personal brands, all while knowing that these Lost Boys are just prey. The real business of the hustle economy isn’t self-actualization or empowerment; it’s self-delusion, mass-marketed and highly profitable.

> The Cost: A Generation Hollowed Out

So where does this leave us? With a generation of men who are nothing but empty shells, men who have wasted their youth chasing shadows, men who wake up one day with nothing to show for their time except a string of expired “opportunities” and a lot of wasted money. Men who have no identity, no skills, and no real place in society. Men who are angrier, more isolated, more vulnerable than ever.

We are producing Lost Boys in factory-like quantities, and the price will be astronomical. A culture built on “influence” over innovation, on *sizzle over steak*, can only go one way: collapse. And when it does, when the next wave of young men finds out that their heroes were hustlers, that their dreams were hollow, that their worth was measured by numbers rather than their true potential, they won’t just be disappointed. They’ll be lost for good. The hustle economy isn’t an answer for these young men; it’s a death sentence dressed as a promise.",Top_Present_5825,336,0.75,466,1731233730,2024-11-10 04:15:30,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gnxluh/cmv_we_are_producing_lost_boys_in_factorylike/,11,2024
1go56j6,CMV: “educate yourself” is the intellectual version of “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” and is elitist,"In my opinion, your worldview is not something you “build yourself with your own two hands” it’s largely given to you.  This is why there are liberal areas where liberal families live and raise liberal kids, same with conservatives.  

I can’t stand people with their self righteous “educate yourself” BS.  These people act like they get up at the 4 am every day to read everything under the sun to make sure they choose the correct moral stance on a given issue, and anyone who hasn’t looked into it or come to the right conclusion is less than.  It’s honestly pathetic and it’s pure mental bias.  

A lot of you might be surprised to see how you would have voted, for instance, if you had come from deep conservative territory.  

It’s especially frustrating because half of the “high moral ground” that many of my leftist contemporaries claim is that they are EMPATHETIC TOWARDS PEOPLE.  My leftist contemporaries have sympathy for the issues that come with poverty in cities but if you’re broke and from the country and you didn’t vote blue, you’re a piece of shit.  It’s ridiculous.  

If someone comes from an area with deep ideology and is able to reject that culture and worldview and build their own, because they disagree with it, that’s amazing and those people should be commended, but people who can’t do that (vast majority of people) should not be demonized.  

If you are proud of your worldview and you think it makes you a better person, believe me you are lucky to have it and it’s a gift.  You didn’t work for it and no one owes you applause, and you’re dead wrong to make villains of people less fortunate.

1god8ad,CMV: I am justified in not inviting family members who vote for anti-same-sex-marriage politicians to my same-sex wedding.,"My fiance and I live in a state that legalized same-sex marriage in 2010, when we had a Democratic governor and Democratic majorities in both our State House and State Senate.

Currently, as of last week's election, it is confirmed that our state will have a Republican governor, and a Republican majority in the State Senate; once all the votes are counted, it is all but guaranteed that Republicans will have a majority in the State House as well.

Our state's Republican Party's platform, as listed on their website,, states that their goal is to, ""recognize marriage as the legal and sacred union between one man and one woman as ordained by God, encouraged by the State, and traditional to humankind, and the core of the Family."" This is dated to April 13, 2024 - it's not an obsolete or outdated policy point for them.

At a national level, a 2024 Gallup Poll showed that only 46% of Republicans believe that same-sex marriages should be recognized by the law as valid. As in our state, the results of last week's election have given us a Republican president, a Republican Senate, and as it stands currently, a very high chance of a Republican House. 

Conveniently, Republicans now also hold a majority on the Supreme Court. In his concurring opinion on the Dobbs case in 2022, Clarence Thomas stated that the court, ""should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell"" - with Obergefell being the case that required the entire nation to recognize and perform same-sex marriages.

In summary: while it's not set in stone quite yet, there is a very distinct chance that, at some point in the next four years, we will become unable to legally marry in our home state, and unable to gain the financial and legal benefits of marriage if we were to have it performed in another state or country.

Because of this looking threat to our rights, we are planning on going to City Hall to get a marriage certificate sometime before the end of the year. At some point further down the road, we can hold a symbolic ceremony and reception, no matter the political situation at the time (we had been putting this off for cost purposes anyways).

When it comes to our guest list, I feel completely justified in instructing our potential guests that, if they have voted for political candidates who belong to the party that threatens our right to marry in the most recent election, then we ask that they do not attend our marriage. I cannot stomach the thought of enabling their hypocrisy, specifically their ability to perform acts that harm us one day, then show up to congratulate us and share in our joy the best day.

While we haven't outright asked everyone on our drafted guest list who they have voted for, it appears that this request would mean that at least, my mother, my grandmother, and many aunts, uncles, and cousins on my fiance's side would be asked to decline their invitations. I am fine with my mother and grandmother not attending, as my father and most of my siblings would be there, and I know that my fiance's mother and brother would be there as well.

My fiance states that, should I make this request, the resultant family drama on his side would be so tumultuous that it would tear the family apart, and he would never hear the end of it until everyone requested not to attend had passed away.

It is worth noting that, prior to my coming up with the idea of this request, his side of the family occupied about three times more of the drafted guest list than my side - he has offered a similar justification that choosing to invite some but not all of his family would cause too much drama. Meanwhile, I had only ever intended to invite my nuclear family, my one surviving grandmother, and the aunt/uncle/cousins that live closest by that I am on the best terms with.

So, what do you think? Is it worth causing ""family drama"" in order to take a stand against hypocrisy? Should I, instead, grin and bear the unwanted presence at our wedding of those who voted against our right to marry?",BosomsaurusRex,1287,0.7200000286102295,910,1731278810,2024-11-10 16:46:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1god8ad/cmv_i_am_justified_in_not_inviting_family_members/,11,2024
1goeneu,"CMV: Americans don’t realize how fortunate they are compared to most of the world.

","Hello guys! 



So, I’m a European, and I wanted to share an outsider's perspective on what I think of American life. I often hear Americans talk about their struggles, the “rat race” culture, healthcare costs, or the pressure to succeed. I get it—no place is perfect. But I sometimes wonder if people in the U.S. realize how much they actually have going for them, especially compared to most of the world.



From where I sit, the U.S. has so many advantages that are easy to take for granted. For instance:



\*\*Higher Salaries and Access to Resources:\*\* When I see what many Americans make, even in entry-level jobs, it’s much higher than in a lot of European countries. It’s not unusual to find people earning really solid money in certain U.S. industries where those jobs just don’t pay as well here. And while the cost of living varies, the potential for income growth in the U.S. is immense.



\*\*Economic Dominance and Influence:\*\* The U.S. has an economy that’s massive on a global scale. American companies, innovations, and cultural exports dominate worldwide. That opens doors for people who might have an idea, product, or dream that could make it big. It’s a different playing field compared to what we have, where things are more stable but often slower and harder to scale.



\*\*Endless Opportunities:\*\* The “American Dream” may be a cliché, but I think there’s some truth in it. The diversity of landscapes, industries, and educational opportunities is unmatched. People from all around the world move to the U.S. specifically to chase opportunities. From Silicon Valley to Hollywood to Wall Street, there are specialized career paths that just don’t exist in other countries.



\*\*Power in Numbers and Influence:\*\* As a European, I see the influence of American culture, politics, and media constantly, even here. The U.S. has a massive cultural and political footprint, which can be frustrating at times, but there’s also power in it. Americans get to help set global trends and policies, and that gives people in the U.S. a voice and level of influence that few other countries have.



\*\*Innovation and Infrastructure:\*\* There’s a strong innovation culture in the U.S., with people who are ready to embrace change. Technology, entertainment, and business innovations often start there before going global. America has some impressive infrastructure, too, even if it doesn’t always seem that way to people living there. For example, you have massive universities with resources on a scale you rarely see anywhere else.



\*\*Social and Cultural Diversity:\*\* The U.S. is so vast and diverse, culturally and socially. I feel like people in the U.S. have endless opportunities to explore different lifestyles, perspectives, and hobbies that bring vibrancy to everyday life. You can meet people from almost every background and culture—something that is harder to find in many smaller, more homogenous countries.



\*\*Higher Education System and Research Opportunities:\*\* While the cost of college in the U.S. is famously high, the country still has some of the best universities and research facilities in the world. Graduating from an American university can open doors globally, and there's a level of innovation and funding in research that’s tough to match elsewhere. Many cutting-edge fields and technologies are pioneered there, making it a fantastic environment for academics and researchers.



\*\*Access to Vast Natural Beauty and Outdoor Activities:\*\* The diversity of landscapes in the U.S. is incredible. There’s everything from national parks and ski resorts to beaches and desert landscapes. Americans have access to some of the most spectacular natural beauty in the world, with the infrastructure and freedom to explore it relatively easily—often just a road trip away. That’s something many countries don’t offer in the same abundance or scale.



\*\*Job Mobility and Flexibility:\*\* In the U.S., it’s relatively common for people to switch jobs or move to different states in search of better opportunities. In many European countries, job markets are more stable but can also be restrictive. In America, people have a high degree of freedom to pursue different paths, start new careers, or move around, which can be both liberating and rewarding.



\*\*Advancements in Medicine and Cutting-Edge Healthcare:\*\* Despite the challenges with affordability, the U.S. is often at the forefront of medical advancements, from high-end surgeries to pioneering treatments for rare conditions. American hospitals and research institutions lead in many fields, and the country offers access to some of the world’s most advanced healthcare technology.



\*\*Consumer Variety and Convenience:\*\* Americans have access to an incredible range of products, often at lower prices compared to much of the world. The convenience culture, where many services are available 24/7, is also unique. Fast food, extensive shopping options, and rapid delivery services add convenience that isn’t as common or accessible elsewhere.



\*\*Support for Innovation and Startups:\*\* The “startup culture” is so deeply rooted in the U.S., and there’s infrastructure to back it up—incubators, venture capital funding, and an investor mindset that encourages people to try new things. People with entrepreneurial ambitions have a lot of resources, networks, and access to capital to help bring their ideas to life, something that’s often harder to come by in more traditional economies.



\*\*Strong Legal System and Individual Rights:\*\* Americans enjoy a high degree of personal freedom and strong protections for individual rights under the Constitution. Freedom of speech, the right to privacy, and legal protections for workers are more robust in the U.S. than in many countries. This legal infrastructure can create a sense of security and autonomy that’s valued by many.



\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Even with its issues, the U.S. has a lot going for it—economic opportunity, natural beauty, innovation, and freedoms that many people around the world dream of. As a European, I wonder if Americans appreciate just how fortunate they are to live in a place that offers so much.",RotenSquids,512,0.7799999713897705,304,1731282737,2024-11-10 17:52:17,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1goeneu/cmv_americans_dont_realize_how_fortunate_they_are/,11,2024
1gp868o,CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective. (At least in the States),"Now I imagine most people already know what the 4B movement is. For those that don't, it is a movement started by women in South Korea where women will be celibate, not get married, not have kids and not have sex with men. Sex strikes are just the latter part.

Now, this concerns the United States, South Korea I've heard plenty of horror stories regarding systemic sexism and thus can understand why those women perform this movement, but its strange when looking at the states.

1. Conservative men are typically very Religious, they not only preach against hookup culture but support celibacy for women and are extremely anti abortion. The 4B movement is everything they want out of women by preventing more abortions and not having sex outside of marriage.

2. Conservative men are not going to go out with more left leaning women who do not share their values, most of these men despise feminists and they have no problem with women they have no interest in not dating them.

3. No Conservative man wants left leaning women to procreate, why would they want more people in future generations to challenge their values instead of populating the future with children who subscribe to their views.

4. This hurts liberal men. Men who are feminists or are sympathetic to these women are far more likely to date and marry the women in these movements, and thus they are hurt by this movement, while nothing changes for conservative men.

In general, it seems like the 4B movement is self defeating and gives conservative men exactly what they want while hurting both left leaning men and women.

1gpm00t,CMV: People should learn English if they’re going to live in the US,"I was surprised this was a controversial opinion to be honest. And no I’m not one of those “people should speak English here people” who gets mad at people for speaking another language to the people they’re with in public. It’s a given that people will always be most comfortable speaking in their first language and language is also culture. I’m also very impressed by those who are bilingual. But I think it’s basic decency for you to learn or be actively trying to learn the predominant language in the country you are moving to. 

This comes up the most with Spanish since the US has a very large Latino/Hispanic population, but it applies to all languages. It’s honestly just a respect thing, if you’re going to come to someone else’s country then you should know the language or try your best to learn enough to make your way around. And I know people are going to say “America doesn’t have an official language” but most of the states do, do most people here would consider that our main language. 

I also think a lot of people protest this because they think American English speakers = white people and learning English is something white people want minorities who come here to do. But that’s not even the case, the majority of people who were born here only speak English. Not to mention black people who have been here 400 years speak English and this is our country as well. To me it’s about basic respect. You wouldn’t move to France and not learn French. You wouldn’t move to Mexico and not learn Spanish. You wouldn’t move to China and not learn mandarin.

1gprni8,cmv: The “girl-bossification” of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is.,"It has become apparent in recent times that sex-work, either through OF or other means, has been received as a feminist movement that empowers women for sexualising themselves in exchange for money.

I’ll preface this by saying that I don’t wish to demonise sex work; women pushed to those positions should be protected and unharmed, and don’t deserve hateful narratives expressed in media.

However, on the other hand, not demonising prostitution or sex work does not mean viewing it as some profound, empowering stance. Sure, in an ideal world, to engage in sex work without the inequality of demand, pay, and income, would possibly result in a less degrading position, but that simply isn’t the world we live in. 

I’ve seen points such as: 

1) “Well, I could be assaulted/consent for sex, without making any money. So why not introduce an economic aspect to it?”

That is a reductive approach to the concept of one’s bodily autonomy. It is absolutely a tragedy that one could be assaulted, and feel as though they could gain something from it—and yes, hypersexuality is often a symptom of those who’ve experienced sexual abuse. These are not (a) empowering decisions, or (b) healthy decisions. In the same way that people may have found unhealthy coping mechanisms for PTSD, trying to own oneself sexually through economic means is similar in that regard. Consent cannot be garnered correctly wherein a transactional relationship is established. 

Similarly, if one does consent to sex, but also considers the monetary gain that could come from it, they may need to consider why they connect sex with an act of labour—is it because you are sleeping with partners you don’t like/are attracted to, or is it seen as an economic benefit that one could obtain? Are you considering sex work because you want to provide for yourself with means that are more easily accessible, as opposed to being rejected/unhappy in the normal corporate world? Perhaps the issue is that we are fed with media that convinces us that luxury is comfortability, and we woe the mundane life. Or perhaps we view sex work as easy and a get-rich quick scheme; consumers of it being stupid and desperate enough to pay for anything. But that isn’t the case.

As I’ve mentioned before, consent via economic transaction is not usual consent. That is not to say it’s abuse, or rape, but it is not normal relationship consent.

1gr1tbe,CMV: It isn't hyperbolic for the west to be worried about the rise of fascism,"Like clockwork, economic downturn inevitably leads to populists using minorities and migrants as cultural scapegoats to solve economic problems - and in turn disillusioned citizens become increasingly disgruntled with existing political structures. It's a fertile space for authoritarian leaders to promise swift and easy solutions to complex questions.

The Great Depression and the post-WW1 economy spurred the rise of the Nazis, Mussolini's Fascist Party and Franco’s Dictatorship.

Here in the UK movements like the BUF, National Front and now arguably UKIP/Reform have bubbled up during The Great Depression, Stagflation and the various modern financial crises respectively.

Even eastwards, while not strictly a fascist state, the dissolution of the Soviet Union opened the door in Russia for far-right, nationalist and authoritarian movements that still maintain power to this day.

It's not hard to draw comparisons between these examples and our contemporary lay of the land. We know the economy isn't ideal for most people right now. We know it's the highest concern for most of a given electorate. We know that minorities and immigrants are being touted as the solution to many of those concerns. We know that sadly, a great deal of those solutions are veering into dehumanization and will only continue to do so while populists continue to win support.

I don't believe we're standing right at the doors of fascism at this very moment and I basically believe many of our institutions can withstand authoritarian power grabs for the time being. But it's my view that a worst-case scenario of a western fascist state - or a fascist movement with a lot of support - is an increasingly possible reality that its pretty reasonable to actively worry and talk about.",hotdog_jones,609,0.699999988079071,721,1731579850,2024-11-14 04:24:10,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gr1tbe/cmv_it_isnt_hyperbolic_for_the_west_to_be_worried/,11,2024

1. women who leave marriages should walk out with the clothes on their backs and nothing else. this happens close to where i live. as a woman, if uou choose to leave your marriage for whatever reason, you don’t get to keep ANYTHING in the house with your husband. not even your clothes and personal belongings.

2. forced marriage. no no no NO. i don’t even need to explain myself for this.

1gst4rz,"CMV: Egypt will collapse, and it will trigger the largest refugee crisis in human history","I believe that Egypt is heading for a catastrophic collapse that will lead to the largest refugee wave we've ever seen. This isn't speculation—it's rooted in harsh realities of demography, food security, and economic pressures.

First, let's talk numbers: Egypt's population has exploded over recent decades, reaching over 110 million people. Projections show that this growth is not slowing down. The population continues to rise, while the country is running out of land to sustain it. Egypt already imports more than half of its food, and they are the world's largest wheat importer. Rising food prices, global supply chain issues, and instability in global markets leave Egypt extremely vulnerable to supply shocks.

Water scarcity is another massive factor. The Nile River, which Egypt relies on for 97% of its water, is under increasing stress from climate change and upstream development, particularly Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam. Egypt has a limited capacity to adapt, and water shortages will only exacerbate food insecurity.

Politically and economically, Egypt faces significant instability. The regime under President el-Sisi has been maintaining order through a combination of subsidies and repression, but this is unsustainable. Rising economic pressure on the poorest citizens, compounded by inflation, energy crises, and unemployment, will create widespread unrest.

When (not if) Egypt's stability breaks, it will trigger a massive outflow of refugees, mainly toward Europe and neighboring countries. We are talking about millions of people moving due to famine, water scarcity, and political collapse. If we look at the Syrian Civil War and the refugee crisis that followed, it pales in comparison to what could happen here.

This isn't just a humanitarian crisis in waiting; it's a geopolitical time bomb that will reshape borders, cause international tensions, and strain global systems. The signs are all there, and ignoring them won't make this looming disaster go away.",Ok_Yellow1,1394,0.9100000262260436,338,1731780487,2024-11-16 12:08:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gst4rz/cmv_egypt_will_collapse_and_it_will_trigger_the/,11,2024
1gtmuou,"CMV: When you sexualize yourself to get attention, you shouldn't be surprised when the attention you receive is sexual","To me this sounds kinda like a ""duh"" take but but apparently some people disagree so I want some insight to shift my view. I'll use women in this example, but i think it applies to men as well.

I'll use the example of Instagram. I absolutely can't stand it now because EVERYTHING is made sexual and it's a bit predatory in my opinion because creators almost FORCE you to view them by gaming the algorithm. One thing I think IG user will come across is a woman who will be making very basic content like describing a news story or telling a trending joke. But the woman makes sure to perfectly position herself where her cleavage is visible because that's usually the only thing in her content that is actually of 'value'.  You see this a lot with IG comedians where the joke is ""sex"" or ""look at my ass/tits"". Like if you watch gym videos you've probably stumbled across one of the many female creators who use gym equipment to do something sexual and the joke is ""Haha sex"". 

But then, as expected, the comments will be split between peopple (usually men) sexualizing the creator and people (usually women) shaming the men for sexualizing her and being ""porn addicted"". But what really do you expect? When you sexualize yourself it shouldn't be a surprise when the attention you get is sexual. And I think that applies to all situations both in real life and online.

Now what I normally see in the comment is the argument that ""well she's a woman and that's just her body. She's not sexualizing it you are"". But I think this is just a cop out that takes away personal responsibility, assumes the women are too dumb to understand how they are presenting themselves and that the viewer is too dumb to have common sense. 

I also think America is so over hypersexualized that people will go out dressing like a stripper and be baffled when they're viewed as such. So yeah pretty much my view is the title that when you oversexualize yourself, it should be a surprise when the attention you get is sexual.

1gty4bv,"CMV: Americans and people in the West's criticism of Netanyahu is for the ""wrong reasons"", and would have been the same if any other Israeli was in charge","Israelis hate Netanyahu, but not because of the reasons Americans/people in the world despise him. Israelis hate Netanyahu because he is a corrupted megalomaniac with a god complex, not because of ""war crimes"" or because of his tough stances on Palestinians. In fact most Israelis dislike the Palestinians (especially after Oct7) and share the tough stances on them. 

Even when Netanyahu goes, Israelis still won't support a 2SS (Most of the opposition opposes it), the War will continue and in fact, all of the criticism about Netanyahu for his management of the War and the genocide remarks would have been the same even if Lapid or Yair Golan were in charge, because when it comes to the War and Oct7, most of Israelis are pretty united. (While they are divided when it comes to the Hostage deal, the global Ceasefire now crowd is using the hostages to push a prominent ceasefire that will keep Hamas in power and end the War, while Israelis who want the hostage deal still want Hamas destroyed and to continue the war after the deal)

The Western left who considers themselves as Pro-Israel and anti-bibi, wants Netanyahu gone because they see him as an ""obstacle"" to the 2 State solution (That nowadays no Israeli and no Palestinian support). They don't really care about his domestic corruption and attempts to become a de-facto dictator. At the same time, if you would say to the Israeli public (including the secular centrists who voted for people like Lapid, Gantz and Lieberman) that the world views Bibi as an obstacle to the 2SS, it would make them appreciate Netanyahu for standing up to the world and deflecting pressures.

1gvch39,"CMV: Male circumcision is wrong, but calling circumcised men ""mutilated"" or implying that they are sexually dysfunctional is also wrong.","Basically, my understanding of the issue of male circumcision is that it is a bad thing, but only mildly so.  

There are statistically low risks of surgical complications, and even lower statistical risk that the complications could result in serious long-term problems.  The only studies that I have seen that claim that circumcised men experience more sexual dissatisfaction, discomfort or dysfunction, are based on online survey results which have low N counts and would suffer from confirmation bias.  The most convincing studies I have seen that are based on meta-analyses and medical data find that circumcised men are not more likely to suffer from sexual dysfunction or dissatisfaction than uncircumcised men.  

The trade-off is the purported hygiene and STD preventing effects of circumcision, which I understand to be questionable at best, and perhaps more applicable to countries where hygiene practices and conditions are not great. 

On the balance, it's not a good practice and it should definitely be discouraged, maybe even banned.  Especially when you factor in more abstract and unproven concerns, like the possible psychological impact on infants and just the abstract point of losing sexual sensitivity relative to uncircumcised men.

All of that being said, I don't think it is either logically accurate or rhetorically effective to describe male circumcision as a form of mutilation, or to imply in any way that circumcised men are sexually dysfunctional.  

I think the word ""mutilation"" implies that there are malicious and/or medically-arbitrary (e.g. purely cultural) *intentions* behind male circumcision, and also that the harm done is severe and debilitating.  I do not think that implication rings true.  I think most parents still believe that the hygiene/STD prevention reasons are valid, and a lot of doctors also don't know well enough to disabuse them of this notion.  And even if the parents due it purely for cultural reasons, as discussed above, the risks and harms of circumcision are relatively minor - parents wouldn't do it otherwise.  

I also think that telling parents that they are ""mutilators"" and circumcised men that they have been ""mutilated"" is unconvincing.  You are using more extreme rhetoric thinking that the fact that it is more extreme means it will have more of an impact, but really that extreme rhetoric just makes the whole position seem unrealistic.  

Especially when it comes to circumcised fathers, who are usually the ones to push for circumcision more than the mothers.  Tell a circumcised father that they have been mutilated and that their son's dick isn't going to work, and they will laugh in your face - because, of course they never considered themselves to be ""mutilated"", and of course they never had problems with their own dick working.  

Tell parents instead ""there's really no benefit to doing this, and there are some pretty severe downsides on the rare chance that it goes wrong"" - and they will be much, much more likely to be convinced.  Not to mention that you are actually telling them the truth, which is always better than lying to people via hyperbole.

1gvof1v,CMV: Pedo hunters/ Vigilantes are NOT doing the right thing ,"
You know, the videos on social media going viral of “pedo hunters” luring men in and then proceeding to humiliate them in public/ beat them and 9/10, they don’t even call the police. So what’s the point of even luring them out if you’re not even going to call the police and report them? Any reason you can think of just leads to these pedo hunters getting some sort of gain/satisfaction from it, and not that they actually care about stopping pedos. If they actually cared about stopping it, they’d have the person arrested instead of just humiliating them and then letting them go to potentially do the same again. 

1: They go viral 
2: They have an excuse to physically assault someone without legal consequences, because they know these guys they’re assaulting won’t call the police because of what they’re being accused of could also get them arrested 
3: They get to look like “hero’s” for beating up a dude who is accused of trying to meet up with children. 

Let me make myself clear, i have absolutely no sympathy for pedophiles. I wish they’d all just drop off the face of the earth. However, this affects much more than just the men caught in these stings. It affects their wives if they have one, their children, their siblings, their family. Anyone closely associated with this person who goes viral will be humiliated aswell. 

Not to mention, some men in this situation actually didn’t know the person was underage until they were already at the meet up location:

Some have died 

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/world/europe/netherlands-pedophile-hunters.html

Either call the police immediately after luring these men out, or sit back and let the police catch them themselves. This whole “look at me i’m a hero because i just beat up a guy and shaved his head and made him eat dog food because he tried to meet a 15 year old boy” isn’t justice, it’s just unnecessary violence. Besides, it isn’t their place to deliver justice, it’s a judges place.

1gvw1rk,CMV: Modern Politics is no longer Left/Right but Up/Down on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,"Modern politics is no longer represented by Left/Right, but instead by Up/Down on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Those needs are portrayed in the shape of a pyramid, as an individual's most basic needs must be satisfied before working towards higher-level needs. The levels are the following, starting from the bottom:

1. Physiological needs
2. Safety needs
3. Belongingness & Love needs
4. Esteem needs
5. Self-actualisation

Currently, based on the issues that Left/Right-wing parties identify with, it's possible to observe a shift from traditional economic/ideological divides towards a division based on different levels of Maslow's hierarchy.

Right-wing parties generally prioritise issues related to the lower levels of the hierarchy, such as Physiological needs (economic stability, food prices, gas prices) and Safety needs (crime, immigration control, self-defence). 

Left-wing parties, on the other hand, prioritise issues related to the higher levels of the hierarchy, such as Belongingness needs (diversity, equality, inclusion), Esteem needs (social justice, representation in media) and Self-actualisation (activism, environmental sustainability).

This is also the reason why a lot of people on either side are unable to comprehend the issues that matter to the other side. If you have to satisfy your Basic needs (Physiological & Safety), you will find Psychological needs (Belongingness, Esteem) to be irrelevant to your current situation, as they're luxuries you can't afford. On the other hand, if you have your Basic needs satisfied already, you'll consider (moderate) increases in prices and a (general) decrease in safety quite irrelevant, as it doesn't affect you that much personally.",Security_Breach,554,0.6899999976158142,388,1732126417,2024-11-20 12:13:37,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gvw1rk/cmv_modern_politics_is_no_longer_leftright_but/,11,2024

In the United States, our values mainly consist of equality, diversity, freedom, democracy, and equal opportunity, just to name a few.

1gx4o9z,CMV: Culling male chicks is the least cruel option after in-ovo sexing,"Several EU countries have banned the practice of culling male chicks because the general population finds it ""icky."" The thing is, factory farming as a whole is inherently icky and culling the male chicks is objectively the most humane way of dealing with the fact that it makes zero economic sense to raise these chickens. Instead of going into the grinder shortly after they hatch, the male chicks are shipped off to live in a warehouse with the absolute worst conditions allowed by law until they're ready for slaughter. So we either kill the chick on day 1 or we kill it on like day 50 after it's spent its entire life inside a windowless warehouse where there's not even enough space to move. Either way, we're killing the chicken and the grinder minimizes the time it has to suffer. 

Raising all of the male chickens also causes a surplus of chicken meat and, since there isn't enough demand for this meat in the EU, it ends up being exported to developing nations and destabilizing their own poultry industry, which will inevitably cause them to be dependent on the EU for food. Without fail, every single time a developing nation has become dependent on wealthier nations for food, it has had absolutely devastating consequences for the development of that nation. So you can't even really argue that ""At least the male chickens are dying for a reason if we slaughter them"" because a) the chickens *literally* do not give a fuck and b) the ""reason"" is to dump cheap meat in Africa. 

Destroying the male eggs before they even hatch with in-ovo sexing is obviously the best option but, as far as I understand, this is still pretty expensive and hasn't been universally adopted. Until the cost for in-ovo sexing comes down, the grinder remains the best option. It would be different if the male chicks were being shipped off to some green pasture to live out their days but this is literally the opposite of what actually happens to them. I would even argue that these bans on culling are a form of performative activism so that privileged Europeans can feel better about themselves while they remain willfully ignorant to the horrors of factory farming.

1gyeswl,CMV: Calling something “common sense” is not a valid argument.,"You are debating someone with a different viewpoint than you. You seem to disagree on fundamental issues. You ask why they believe what they do, and they respond “it’s just common sense.” How do you argue against that?

I see this way too often, where people seem to use the term common sense to justify their bigotry. Why? Because “common sense” can be used to describe things so arbitrarily. It is used to oversimplify more nuanced topics.

This isn’t a one sided issue, so I will give two examples, and keep in mind I’m not disagreeing with the arguments themselves:

- **Common Sense Gun Laws:** When you describe the gun laws as common sense, how is it so? Is it common sense to folks that are hunters and gun enthusiasts that believe that gun ownership is their right? This seems like a case where “common sense” is being used to prevent further conversation about solutions to an issue like gun violence.

- **Economic Policy:** A lot of times, people will argue that social programs shouldn’t exist or should be limited because “It’s common sense, you get money by working hard.” But is it common sense for the people that have used social programs to get back on their feet and provide them the opportunity to make a living? Like the last example, this argument takes away the nuance.

You can see how that term can be weaponized. It is a fallacy. It is used as an argument to evade providing actual evidence, and just resort to what they perceive as the reality.

2. A married couple could possess 2 billion dollars, so lets eliminate that argument at the start.

3. Choosing 1 billion is subjective, it could be 5 billion, or 500 million. I am picking this number to demonstrate that I have no problems with capitalism, nor am I advocating for communism, or that I don't acknowledge that societies in general will always have wealth inequality. 

4. I do hope this doesn't end up being an echo chamber, because part of this position does seem a bit 'obvious.' 

5. I don't have some great answer for how a redistribution would work, however, I don't necessarily think this should be a reason to not do it.

1gyvez1,cmv: Abortion bans like the one in Idaho don't actually protect the life of the mother because they were intentionally drafted to allow for excessive danger to women.  ,"Many of the abortion bans are dangerous for women.  Conservatives say these bills aren't dangerous because they provide exceptions for life of the mother.  I actually bought this line to some extent until these news stories started popping up, and even then I was a bit skeptical, but I decided to research these bans myself, and that's when I saw exactly how dangerous they are.

The one in Idaho provides that an abortion may be performed when ""necessary to save the life of the mother"" with no clarification given as far as I can tell. That is both incredibly restrictive language, and incredibly vague. So let's say a woman has a 45% chance of dying if the doctors don't perform an abortion, is doing one ""necessary"" to save her life? What about 10%? With a 2-5 year prison sentence awaiting any doctor who violates these rules, and with them being so strict and vague, it's no wonder than women are being put in dangerous positions.  

""Necessary"" in other statutes and case law is often deemed to include a time requirement. So even if a condition will likely lead to the mother's death, a doctor may have to wait until the situation gets bad enough to actually treat her which further adds to the danger. 

As incompetent as state legislators can be, half of them are lawyers and know exactly what they were doing with language like this.  They are making it as difficult as possible to get an abortion while still telling the public they are protecting the lives of women, even when they are not.

Even if one is pro life, most of them still support protections for the life of the mother. They should want these bans to be repealed and to be replaced with something more reasonable that actually protect the life of the mother

I don’t know if I’m allowed to identify a subreddit here but there’s one particular page that is notorious for this. There was a whole thing about how Trump threatened Kamala supporters but he actually said something like “raise your hand actually don’t do that because it would be bad” at one of his rally’s which in reality is not a threat. It’s unprofessional and should not be coming from a presidential candidate but they made it seem worse than it was. The same rhetoric exists around abortion. Labeling anybody anti abortion as someone who wants to control women’s bodies when their reality could be that they genuinely believe it’s murder. I think when you say these things to make someone seem more extreme than they actually are then it makes people see the actual harm they bring to society in a less harmful way. They look like they’re being attacked. I always say, if you believe in something the truth should be enough to convince people Trump said plenty of terrible things and a lot of it is posted on his website. Weaponize his real words against him.

1h1sxtn,CMV: Adultery Should Be Treated as Breach of Contract with Financial Penalties,"Marriage isn’t just about love; it’s also a legal agreement regulated by the government. When you get married, you get a government-issued marriage license, which essentially makes it a formal contract between two people. So, if someone cheats (without consent), isn’t that a clear breach of the agreement? And if contracts in business or other legal contexts come with penalties when broken, why not this one too?

Here’s my view: adultery should be treated as fraud or deceit, not just a personal issue. If one partner cheats, there should be tangible, government-enforced consequences - like fines or losing alimony rights. This wouldn’t make cheating a criminal offense, but it would acknowledge the harm caused and hold the cheater accountable. Right now, the cheated-on spouse often suffers emotionally *and* financially (if they choose to start divorce proceedings), while the cheater faces no real repercussions. That’s just unfair.

If the government is involved in the marriage process from the start, issuing licenses and all that, why shouldn’t they also enforce penalties for breaching this contract? It’s not about moral policing; it’s about fairness and accountability.

Why shouldn’t adultery have legal consequences like other forms of fraud?",SinghStar1,330,0.6800000071525574,635,1732788997,2024-11-28 04:16:37,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h1sxtn/cmv_adultery_should_be_treated_as_breach_of/,11,2024

Reddit has a moderator problem. They can do a lot of things to you that doesn't really make lots of sense, and they do not give you a reason for it. More often than not, you're just muted from speaking with the moderator. Unfortunately, due to a lot of Reddit mods and Redditors in general being left-wing, there are a lot of examples of right-wingers being the victims. Such as this one on the r/ medicine Subreddit. He got deleted for asking questions. A person said Trump's NIH nomination caused ""large scale needless death"". When he was asked what the large scale death in question was, his comment was deleted by the mods. Along with a person being perm banned for saying ""orange man bad. Laugh at joke. Unga Bunga"" in r/ comics. The most notable case of moderation abuse is from r/ pics where they just ban you for participating in a ""bad faith Subreddit"". Even if you just commented.

This is not a good thing. It means that if you want to participate in a major Subreddit with a lot of people, you will have to conform to what the moderators personally see as ""correct"" or ""good"".

1h2li68,CMV: Authors Have No Obligation to Make Their Fiction Morally Perfect,"I’ve seen criticism directed at J.K. Rowling for her portrayal of house elves in Harry Potter, particularly the fact that they remain slaves and don’t get a happy ending. I think it’s completely valid for an author to create a grim, imperfect world without feeling obligated to resolve every injustice.

Fiction is a form of creative expression, and authors don’t owe readers a morally sanitized or uplifting narrative. A story doesn’t have to reflect an idealized world to have value it can challenge us by showing imperfections, hardships, or unresolved issues. The house elves in Harry Potter are a reflection of the flawed nature of the wizarding world, which itself mirrors the inequalities and blind spots of our own society.

Expecting authors to “fix” everything in their stories risks turning fiction into a checklist of moral obligations rather than a creative exploration of themes. Sometimes the lack of resolution or the depiction of an unjust system is what makes a story compelling and thought-provoking.

Ultimately, authors should have the freedom to paint their worlds as grim or dark as they want without being held to a standard of moral responsibility.

3. Reforms are stagnated. We can’t even get good healthcare bills passed because big insurance, pharma, healthcare providers will lobby against it.

1h3fhh0,CMV: Liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only,"For a democracy to thrive it needs the following (among others):

* A population that agrees on facts: Therefore, channels of information (e.g., podcasts, social media, and traditional media) need to be able to distribute fair and accurate information to the public.
* A population that is informed of their civic duty and is willing to honor them: This means that political participation should be enabled as much as possible e.g by making voting as easy as possible, but most importantly by making education much more than just preparation for a job, but more about how to function as a participant in a society where democracy is the political system
* A political system that is not corrupted by money and special interests: i.e. shouldn't be allowed to buy votes or pay (donate to) politicians to pass favorable legislation.

Around the world, all of the above points are being undermined for example in the EU one of the vice presidents of the EU parliament was arrested for accepting bribes from Qatar, see here: [https://www.politico.eu/article/mep-kaili-charged-with-corruption-by-belgian-prosecutors-reports/](https://www.politico.eu/article/mep-kaili-charged-with-corruption-by-belgian-prosecutors-reports/)

There are many examples of the lack or deterioration of the above basic requirements in numerous places hence my view is that liberal democracies will eventually only be democracies in name only in the future unless we find a way of fixing the :

* information sources so that people can agree on the facts
* Voting is made easier and people understand their civic duty
* Remove corruption from politics.",kindly102,382,0.800000011920929,200,1732982133,2024-11-30 09:55:33,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h3fhh0/cmv_liberal_democracies_are_decaying_into/,11,2024
1h44j71,CMV: Men and Women should ALWAYS be held to the same standard within any given job,"I was having a conversation with a woman about why more women aren't pilots and they had all these reasons why, and they said something that gave me pause. They said that in aviation everyone is held to the same standard but when giving the reasons why more women weren't in aviation, they didn't mention that maybe women simply can't or aren't willing to meet that standard. I think firefighting is another job where women are expected to meet the same standard as well.

In jobs such as the military, women are held to an objectively lower standard and arguably a lower subjective standard when it comes to discipline. This doesn't make sense to me as if someone is doing a specific job, regardless of their sex, there is a standard to do that job and I think everyone should be held to that standard period. This means one of two things for me:

1. If someone is unable to meet the standards required for the job then they just don't have the prerequisites required to accomplish the job and should not be hired.
2. If the standards are lowered so that a group of people are able to meet the requirements, then the standards should be lowered across the board because this shows that's the actual standard needed.

1h671rd,CMV: it’s not “disrespectful” or bigoted to incorrectly eat or prepare ethnic food under most circumstances,"So, let me start by saying that I do get where the other side of this issue is coming from. I’m Greek American. People incorrectly eat our food quite often. From putting dill in tzatziki (maybe some Greeks do that but no Greek owned restaurant I’ve ever been to has, nor has my family or any family I know and have eaten with), to honey mustard chicken gyros, and more. I find it annoying. However, that doesn’t mean I have a right to tell other people how they want to eat food on their plate.

If someone wants to eat a honey mustard chicken gyro or put dill in their tzatziki, go for it. Who am I to judge? If you enjoy your food, that’s what matters most.

That being said, I can see some exceptions to this. For example, if a friend is trying to introduce you to their culture through food, I’d recommend eating and preparing the food how it’s meant to be eaten and prepared. That being said, that isn’t really about cultural respect as much as it is about respecting your friend.

The other argument for the other side that I’ve heard is that there are reasons why food is prepared certain ways in certain cultures, normally for health and practical reasons. And, I get that. But, I’d argue that as long as you’re not really harming anyone, it’s fine.

I guess there’s also the argument that the food item comes from a culture consisting of people of color or oppressed groups. In which case, it’s harder for me to speak on that because I am white. But, I’d again argue that there isn’t really any harm done? If anyone has a different perspective, feel free to share it.

Everywhere I turn, from reputable newspapers to specialized journals, I can’t read more than a paragraph without being hit by a pop-up that demands I pay $12 a month for [Random Publication Here].

I’m not inherently against the idea of supporting quality journalism, but the way it’s currently done seems to be pushing people away. There’s no shortage of nonsense on the web that’s completely free of paywalls. Bad information fueled by shock value and conspiracy theories never costs a dime. Meanwhile, good information from credible sources sits behind a locked gate. Every time I open an article only to have my scrolling abruptly interrupted by a paywall, I’m tempted to just chuck my phone across the room.

We wonder why people have such distorted worldviews, but can we really be surprised? When factual, well-researched reporting is locked behind a paywall, and the first page of search results is littered with free, sensationalized content, what do we think people will gravitate toward? It’s a no-brainer: they’ll go for what’s accessible, even if it’s garbage. And when that’s what people read day in and day out, it inevitably shapes their perspective on reality.

I’m tired of this cycle. I’m tired of feeling like the best information is hidden away, and that I’m being forced into the arms of social media’s algorithm-driven content.

1h8x7bt,"CMV: The solution to police misconduct in the US isn’t defunding, but ramping up training/requiring a 4 to 6 year degree.","For context, this isn’t to dismiss a very real and longstanding issue of police forces abusing their power in various parts of the United States, or civil asset forfeiture, or the increase in militarization we’ve seen due to the Pentagon’s 1033 Military Equipment Lending program to police departments.

However, a few years ago, post-2020, I had the idea of a *Four Year Force* Program as a possible win-win for police reform advocacy.

The basic idea is it’d be a kind of GI Bill for people looking to join the police force (ie a free ride). 

There’d be a standardized, baseline federal curriculum for aspiring police officers, which would include:
- firearms discipline
- physical fitness benchmarks
- deescalation and negotiation training, and 
- civil rights 101

It’d also be part of an ordinary bachelor’s degree, so they’d be among other students and not separate from the population they might one day serve. Officers looking to join SWAT or similar would need 2 years of additional training.

That’s the basic idea, borne out from my concluding the lack of training an high stakes is mostly why we see what we see. 

However, I suspect there are very glaring reasons why this idea might be awful, and I wanted to hear those out before I start, say, writing op-eds to my local paper to pitch this idea to my congressman.",Pathos316,420,0.8100000023841858,399,1733591865,2024-12-07 11:17:45,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h8x7bt/cmv_the_solution_to_police_misconduct_in_the_us/,12,2024
1h94uka,CMV: The only thing Conservatives conserve is wealth for the wealthy. ,"Throughout recent history, there have been ""conservative"" political parties. These parties have always been about one primary thing and that is hoarding wealth for the upper class.

The conservatives in Britain are a great example. The Tories there have existed since time began as a proxy for the landed interests, especially the monarch. The same is true everywhere in the world, where deep pockets fund political operations dedicated to keeping those very same pockets deep. 

Sure, some are religious nutballs intent on forcing sharia law of whatever sort down people's throats, but these religious parties are always, ALWAYS, somehow associated  and/or backed by oligarchs and other well-funded sources intent on taking power.  

Which gets back to the main point for those conservatives which is accumulating wealth.

1h9o6wr,CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term.,"Before I present my case, I want to get two things out of the way. One, I am a Democrat who voted for Kamala Harris, so I would very much like to be wrong. Two, this analysis does not take into account the possibility that no future elections are held. While I'm not convinced US elections are over forever, half of Reddit seems to be. Anyway, here's why I believe the Democrats are fucked even if democracy remains intact.

The 2024 election should have been a lay-up for Kamala Harris. Biden and Trump were both historically unpopular nominees, so much so that a man changed his legal name to ""Literally Anybody Else"" and ran a joke campaign. Biden was replaced by Harris in July, leading to tons of enthusiasm and small-dollar donations on the Democratic side. The economy was (and is) doing considerably better than in most other countries, including wealthy European nations. Most importantly, her opponent was a senile old man whose inaction led to the deaths of over a million people in the United States alone, was the only head of state to deny climate change, and tried to overthrow the government on his way out. Despite having the easiest possible set of circumstances with which to win a presidential election, *she still lost.*

Furthermore, rural voters are never going to vote for Democrats again. Local media, commonly cited as an antidote to polarization, has shriveled up, to be replaced by right-wing talk radio. Now, if Democrats could lose those areas by 30 points instead of 50 points, that would go a long way in the swing states. However, they don't just need swing states to remain viable as a national party (more on that later). Additionally, the 2024 election saw urban centers, people of color, and many other demographics that traditionally vote for Democrats swing violently rightward. As a 24-year-old man myself, I'm shocked but not surprised that Trump outright won men under 30. And I don't think they're coming back, because the Democrats won't embrace alternative media - there will never be a left-wing Joe Rogan. If the Democrats can't make up ground in rural areas, but also lose core parts of their base, they are doomed.

The situation is even more dire in the Senate, especially important because the Senate is the only chamber that can confirm or block nominees to the judiciary. Even with a 47-seat minority, the Democrats will still control both seats in several states that voted for Trump in this election. This includes both Arizona seats in a state Trump won by more than 5 percentage points. In other words, the Democrats are far more likely to lose Senate seats than to gain them in the long term. Even in the short term, the Democrats have just two pick-up opportunities in 2026 Senate - North Carolina (which has remained elusive for Democrats at the federal level since 2008!) and Maine (in which the unbeatable Susan Collins is likely to run again). Even if the Democrats can elect a President, they can only do so much without the Senate on their side, and if the judiciary gets right-wing enough, they will start green-lighting even more egregious voter suppression than we've already seen, which will eventually make it virtually impossible for Democrats to win again.

Finally, let's look at the media. In a craven display of anticipatory obedience, the Washington Post infamously did not endorse Kamala Harris this year. To make matters worse, MSNBC's Morning Joe (the channel of choice for the #Resistance) is already sucking up to Trump because they fear he'll try to shut them down. Trump would be foolish to shut them down, of course, because they're perhaps more responsible than anyone else for him returning to power. But in the period between the 2016 election and Trump's inauguration, I remember there being a lot more protests among both Democratic lawmakers and Democratic civilians than I see this time. That could partly be because the Kyle Rittenhouse precedent allows white vigilantes to murder protestors and get away with it, in which case I don't blame people for being too scared to protest. But the Democrats seem demoralized rather than angry, which is why I don't think they will engage in the necessary activism to resist Trump's worst policies.

1hahwza,CMV: People care a disproportionate amount about the war in Gaza compared to other conflicts.,"First off, I am not saying that we should be not shining a light on Israel's crimes, colonial aspirations and possible genocide.   
  
I'm curious as to why no one talks about UAE's involvement in South Sudan, a war that is just as colonial, is longer lasting and has resulted in the death, rape and misplacement of far far more civilians. The UAE has very close ties with the US and receives considerably military, logistic and financial support. Your tax dollars are funding the murder of millions of people in South Sudan.  
  
I've never seen anything on my feed or on any random subreddit about Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. Saudi receives weapons from the US and the UK (and others) and uses them against civilians, causing mass starvation and has resulted in far more deaths than in Gaza. It is currently the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe.   
  
Recently people have been posting about Israel invading parts of Western Syria and destroying chemical weapons facilities but I didn't see a single post when Turkey repeatedly invaded and occupied Northern Syria which they continue to do.   
  
In my view, it can't be lack on emotional bandwidth as all the aforementioned wars started long before the most recent invasion of Gaza. It can't be about colonialism as the UAE's ambitions in South Sudan are purely motivated by economic colonialization. It can't be about the West's support for Israel as we support the UAE just as much as we support Israel, President Mohammed bin Zayed recently visited the White House and Biden called the UAE a ""Major Defense Partner"". Every year they are growing closer with the US, the UK, etc  
  
Again, I'm not suggesting that that people shouldn't be posting about Israel's crimes, but if we care about human suffering, colonialism and our governments supporting awful regimes I should be seeing even more posts about UAE in South Sudan or Saudi Arabia in Yemen or Turkey in Syria.   
  
Is it purely ignorance or is it more sinister antisemitism or something else entirely?

1hbydut,"CMV: Taxation is not theft. In fact, it is more akin to a modest admission ticket to participate in the economy.","I think a lot of people get their paycheck and see tax deductions and feel robbed. Like what do you mean my yearly salary is not actually how much I take home?"" Right? Libertarians make the the saying ""taxation is theft"" their rallying cry, often arguing that no taxation is acceptable, and the government should essentially disband or be at least decimated. 

I think this argument is intuitive to a lot of people because it does not feel like the benefits we get out of our tax dollars is not as valuable to us as the money would have been. When the average person thinks about how tax dollars benefit them they probably think about roads and maybe the mail or schools but not much else unless they receive government benefits like Medicaid or SNAP. In fact, the ways the government helps poor people are a lot more visible than the ways the might help everyone else. When poor people are essentially getting a monthly check from the government every month, I think it's easy for the average person to conclude that taxes are basically a scam to transfer money from working people to bums who don't work. 

But I think the benefit of tax dollars for the average American are actually much greater than we see at a glance, and the average American benefits from taxation far more than they lose because the government creates and manages the economic conditions that allow us to earn so much in the first place. 

Let's say you're a car salesman at a Toyota dealership. That dealership exists because cheap, safe trade is possible with Japan. This safe free trade is facilitated by the US military, which supports the defense of allies like Japan that could be invaded by China if the US were not an ally. If Japan were at war with China, the country might be blockaded, embargoed, or sanctioned by China in ways that make exports more expensive. Japan would also have to devote tremendous resources to their war effort. Domestic labor would be shorthanded and car manufacturing might have to be converted for war machines. If it were possible to get Toyota cars out at all, they would be more expensive. If China won the war they might impose trade restrictions on Japanese cars to the US to support its own vehicle industry. Also keep in mind the Japanese car industry only exists because the United States supported Japan's economic recovery after WW2 (with taxes), which created the Japanese economic miracle, which allows them to keep producing cheap cars. This relationship with Japan is only possible because the US won WW2 (with tax dollars). 

Imagine if FDR had been a penny pinching libertarian. He might have gone to war with Japan but would he have converted US industry to the extent necessary to win the war? Would he have raised taxes to fund the war effort if taxes are inherently theft? Or would he have negotiated for peace the moment he could secure non-aggression with Imperial Japan? Libertarian Truman certainly would never have approved funds to help Japan's economy recover. Libertarian FDR/Truman probably means no winning WW2, no Japanese economic miracle, no cozy trade relationship, which means no cheap cars in 2024. 

Your job selling cars at Toyota exists because of decisions made by the government 80 years ago supported by a tremendous tax burden, and tax dollars continuously spent to support that status quo. And besides you, customers benefit from cheap reliable cars. And the government collects tax revenue on the sales to make up for its expenses. This whole industry that benefits us all would not exist without the government spending money. This is how economies grow and create more wealth overall than existed before taxation.

While Toyota cars are maybe an easy example, there are so many other ways the government upholds the economy, such that this reasoning can apply to any job. Domestic cars? Made with imported steel and exported for profit that allows the company to grow and employ more people. Work at Walmart? Full of cheap imported goods. Bank? Insured by the government. Library? Government. Law? All about the government. Farm? Subsidized by the government. Healthcare? Majorly bloated with employees bc of the government. 

All of this is not to say that the government is perfect or that you should be ""thankful."" I am just arguing that we should recognize that the government is a necessary institution that requires taxes to work. Every day millions of Americans drive to work in Toyota cars on roads built and maintained by the government, kept safe by the government, to work in industries supported by the government, buy goods and services kept cheap by the government, and send their kids to schools provided at no cost by the government and wonder where all their tax dollars are going. Your tax dollars are all around you mate. 

And I know a lot of people are going to say this can all still exist with a free market and no government, but we have never seen that happen in the real world. Imagine what no government truly means. You would have to pay a toll of some sort to use a road if you did not build it yourself. You would have to pay a regular fee for police and fire protection. Your employer would not be required to provide healthcare, a bare minimum salary, or safe working conditions. You would be nickel and dimed at every turn so often that it would be just as bad as paying taxes or worse. And that's only assuming the inevitable corporate monopolies play nice and do not decide to simply enslave you. If a libertarian utopia were possible I just think it would have been accomplished by now. 

There are already places on earth in which there is no government. Haiti's government has collapsed. If you hate the government you can just move there. But it's a gang-controlled hell hole and nobody has the power to stop it except governments. People there are desperate. They would work for pennies to make iphones or flip flops or whatever but nobody can build a factory there because it would be taken over by gangs. Governments create order which creates economies which create wealth. You cannot have the economy and wealth without the government. All the government asks is a small fee in the form of taxes. 

Taxation is not theft, it is a small admissions fee to enjoy the robust, lucrative economy created and maintained by the government. Again, not perfect, but far better than the alternative. The lie that taxation is theft was created and circulated by rich people who know that less government means more power for them.

1hcxwer,CMV: Reddit's male spaces are completely broken and no longer represent men at all.,"I genuinely want someone to try change my mind on this because it's such a disparaging thought.

I've recently had a bit of an experience in r/askmenadvice that really irked me. I have found myself on the receiving end of the bullshit and seen some things I really don't like about collective male behaviour on Reddit.

Here's an example thread (on mobile so I'll edit with the link in a sec.

I have literally just been trying to argue my point that these spaces are public despite having 'men' in the name, and that we should be kinder and more considerate. There are 1000+ people reading even 0 upvote posts, who may be damaged by the casual women bashing that is so common, and many people have admitted to me that women should expect. They are extremely unlikely to participate because of the backlash.

These loud few boys do not take any accountability for how their actions affect other people. I do not care how old they are, they are simply not emotionally men yet if that's how they think. I appreciate that they are hurting, but choosing not to grow up has never been and will never be a successful strategy for coping with the real world.

In my opinion, men take responsibility. This is true for every happily married man I know IRL.

Approx 95% of the 'men' I've interacted with in these spaces are telling me the following:

1. I'm too angry/emotional with my argument - which implies my opinion as a man is invalid (feeling my emotions does not scare me now I've sought therapy)
2. That vulnerable people should not access these spaces if they can't handle it (that doesn't change that they still will)

Particularly concerning is that the sub descriptions openly have rules like 'be nice' and say that men are keen to open up their feminine side.

Staying cold and distant ain't the way to do it. Becoming a man for me has been all about understanding my emotions and exercising them helpfully.

Things that will CMV:

- Examples of reddit male spaces that aren't like this
- Genuine discussion of where my cognitive dissonance may lie on the matter

Things that will not CMV:

- Being told I am being dramatic/too angry/emotional about this. I feel very passionately about this and I will not censor myself when I've just expressed an opinion that I feel most men IRL share with me.
- Being told that's just the way it is, and I should ignore it. I believe that men can moderate ourselves and take responsibility better.

From my perspective, while I appreciate people need to vent to heal, Male Reddit is making things much, much worse. It's actually become a barrier to proper growth for anyone who interacts with them regularly and thinks it's normal.

The common counter arguments are religious freedom parental rights that cutting on boys genitals is medicine and the it’s legal argument 

I will address all the objections that I’m aware of 

1. As far as religious freedom I don’t believe religious freedom includes the “right” to carve your religion onto someone else’s body regardless of what holy book people quote the boy’s bodily autonomy and bodily integrity outweighs this

2. In regards to “parental rights” I don’t believe in the concept at all parents shouldn’t be allowed to do whatever they want to their children just cause “parental rights” if a parent produces child porn of thier kids they would rightfully be behind bars for their actions it wouldn’t matter if the parent who produced child porn used “parental rights” as a defense 

Likewise parents should be prohibited from being able to cut on the genitals of baby boys and people should be able to take their parents to court for having their genitals cut on without thier consent 

3. The most common “defense” for circumcision being “medicine” is the AAP statement which has been expired for years and the AAP did not renew the policy endorsing circumcision and when it was in effect the other pediatric organizations that weren’t in the United States condemned it as a culturally biased paper

And there’s an entire industry that makes billions of dollars from cutting on the genitals of baby boys and use them for biotech companies 

4. Just because it’s legal to cut on the genitals of baby boys does not mean people should do so slavery used to be a legal practice in the USA as well the fact that it’s legal only indicates who is in power not that it’s justified to cut on babies genitals

Not to mention anti cannabis laws did not stop people from advocating to legalize cannabis 

Anti abortion laws don’t stop people from advocating for legalizing abortion 

Pro abortion laws don’t stop people from advocating to make abortion illegal 

Likewise the fact that it’s legal to cut on the genitals of baby boys is not going to stop intactivists from advocating to make it illegal to cut on the genitals of baby boys and pressing for every single piece of legislation that makes it more difficult for circumcisions to happen such as defunding circumcision adding more burdens on the hospital so that they are like it’s not profitable anymore to cut on boys genitals etc.",flashliberty5467,440,0.6600000262260437,773,1734213879,2024-12-14 16:04:39,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hedrsk/cmv_circumcision_is_child_abuse/,12,2024
1hettt0,CMV: The New Jersey Drone’s are just mass hysteria.,"People are seeing planes and helicopters, maybe some small recreational drones from hobbyists.

I was really interested in this issue at first, however I noticed a reoccurring theme: nearly every time someone posts a photo or video of the “smoking gun” everyone goes “holy shit!” for the first hour or so. After that, someone figures out it’s an exact match for a helicopter, or a plane that was near the airport. It takes too long for a positive ID, and by the time it’s found everyone’s moved on to the next smoking gun- leading to many threads with the vast majority of comments freaking out about the phenomenon, burying comments that solve what it actually is.


Here’s the thing: I want to be wrong. I want to feel the magic of the drone invasion again. Someone change my view on this, because currently I believe this is a wave of mass hysteria that’s leaking into other states as more and more people see the “drones”.",toadwideweb,541,0.7799999713897705,365,1734273403,2024-12-15 08:36:43,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hettt0/cmv_the_new_jersey_drones_are_just_mass_hysteria/,12,2024
1hezsg8,CMV: Misandry isn’t Feminism,"This is something that in recent years both me and feminist friends find bothersome within the movement, and getting out of hand.

With the number of Feminism support declining, and people hating on Feminism, as well as Feminists exiting the movement, many couldn’t help but think where and how it went wrong.

Feminism is a movement that used to be about Women rights, but it never truly meant hating on men or becoming the same oppressive monsters “who think they know better for both sexes” as men once used to be towards women, making women not having the right to vote, etc. etc.

Feminism as it went forward after those past achievements, was all about one thing: Opposing PATRIARCHY and it’s rules or teachings, introducing instead more loving and empathetic ones instead. Not opposing men. Understanding that both men and women suffer under it, and wanting to free humanity from it.

But yet despite the benevolence in that… Feminism faced an insane amount of hate and opposition all over the world, and if you listen to the reasons why, you wouldn’t be surprised.

That’s when it dawned on me.

*The public hates Misandrists. Not Feminists.*

It is likely that despite the benevolence of Feminism, a population of Misandrist saw Feminism as an “excuse” to spread Misandry equal to the level of toxicity of the patriarchy and Misogyny.
Possibly turning into the very same monsters that real Feminism tried to liberate women from, except this time focusing on men.

In that sense, Misandry paints Feminism the bad image that many people all over the world sadly mistake it for. 

Instead of being a movement on love, equality, and liberation, the hatred that Patriarchy-induced Misandry brings into such “Feminism” brings the movement unironically closer towards the Patriarchy and it’s teachings, than against it.

Feminism is about gender equality. Empathy, not tyranny. Harmony and love for all, not hate.

I would rather call this type of Feminism the “Matriarchy”, which reflects more traits and behaviors in common with the toxicity of the Patriarchy. 
Rather than Feminism.",DittoBurrito123,217,0.6899999976158142,653,1734289787,2024-12-15 13:09:47,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hezsg8/cmv_misandry_isnt_feminism/,12,2024
1hfn4kf,Cmv: Trying to be manly is ironically very unmanly,"This is a specific type of person. Guys who try desperately to be manly “alpha” men, who are very insecure about how others see them and become very emotional if anyone dares think they are not mr macho man are ironically very unmanly. They cannot do something which they consider “feminine” because they are manly men what if someone sees them. They are slaves to gender stereotypes and society. They have to try to look as “manly” as possible and anyone who does not look like that is automatically less of a man to them. What is manly is obviously not always universally defined, but going off gender stereotypes, i feel that caring so hard about being manly is not very manly. It is also the same kind of guy who is always becoming so angry at everything and yet says that men are not emotional as if anger is not an emotion. 

I feel as if being brave enough to truly be your authentic self in the world without trying to be manly and just being who you are is what is actually manly. You do whatever you want it does not matter if someone else might think it is not masculine, who cares. That being said if you happen to fit into the masculine stereotype then that is cool and completely fine. As long as you are not a try hard or asshole about it.

1hghe43,CMV: It's perfectly reasonable for a country to ban or severely restrict immigration from Islamic countries ,"I'm personally generally not a fan of religion. And I think Christianity is also problematic and contains a fair amount bigotry and sexism for example. However, I'd say in 2024 Islam is definitely by the far the most dangerous and most intolerant major religion in the world. Of course there are millions of Muslims who are reasonable people, who have fairly moderate or even progressive views, sure. But by and large the way Islam is being practiced today makes it the most intolerant and most dangerous major religion that exists.

A pretty large percentage of Muslims around the world hold beliefs that are extremely at odds with Western ideals such as democracy, liberty equality and human rights. According to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/#:~:text=Sharia%20as%20the%20Official%20Law%20of%20the%20Land&text=In%20South%20Asia%2C%20high%20percentages,%25) a very significant percentage of Muslims worldwide support Sharia law, and of those a significant percentage believe in things such as the death penalty for leaving Islam or stoning people for adultery. In almost every Muslim-majority homosexuality is illegal and in some it's even punished by death. Many Muslim majority countries have male guardianship laws, blasphemy laws and ex-Muslims in many Muslim countries would risk their lives if they openly came out as ex-Muslim.

And even many Muslims in the West continute to hold many of those extremely illiberal beliefs and ideas. According to a 2015 poll around half of all Muslims in the UK think homosexuality should be illegal, 39% believe a wife should always be obedient to her husband, and 23% support Sharia law. And many Islamic ideology not only has serious consequences for people in the Muslim community but also for society as a whole. The UK for example has a very high rate of forced marriages, the victims often being women from Muslim immigrant families, and the UK also has one of the highest rates of [honor-based violence and killings](https://www.jns.org/uk-honor-based-crimes-up-62-in-2-years/), much of that happening within the Muslim community.

But Islamic ideology also severely affects society as whole in non-Muslim countries. The vast majority of the most deadly terrorist attacks in Europe in the 21st centuries for example were commited by Islamic extremists. The Madrid train bombins, the Paris terror attacks, the Nice truck attack, the London bombins, the Brussels bombings, the Barcelona terror attack, the Manchester arena bombing, that's just a few of the terrorist attacks commited by Islamic extremists in Europe. Islamic ideology has a chilling effect on free speech, with the free press in Europe these days being afraid to publish material the Muslim word could see as offenseive after events like the Charlie Hebdo shooting where employees at a French satirical magazine were killed for saying publishing a caricature of the prophet.[ In the UK a teacher is still in hiding](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13276847/teacher-pupils-cartoon-prophet-mohammed-hiding.html) and fearing for his life, because he dared show students at his school a depiction of prophet Muhammed. I mean how far have we come if a teacher, not in Afghanistan, but in the UK must live in hiding, fearing for his life because they've offended the wrong people?

So in summary I think it's absolutely reasonable for a country to refuse to admit people who adhere to Islamic ideology. Many Muslims may have fairly moderate or even progressive views, and the majority of Muslims are peaceful people for sure. But given how much Islamic ideology has already affected many non-Muslim countries, no government should be expected to gamble with people's lives and admit millions of people from Muslim-majority countries, where inevitable a signficant percentage of those will likely turn out to hold beliefs and ideas that are extremely at odds with Western ideals like liberty and freedom.",RandomGuy92x,1461,0.7400000095367432,1200,1734460517,2024-12-17 12:35:17,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hghe43/cmv_its_perfectly_reasonable_for_a_country_to_ban/,12,2024
1hgjslt,CMV: There is nothing wrong in seeking escorts if you can't get laid,"Lots of conventionally unattractive or socially awkward men nowadays struggle to get female attention all their lives and it can continue well into late 20s. Dating apps have made things worse and further ruins their already fragile confidence. I myself have faced this and know quite a few people who do so as well. It stings when you do a lot to improve yourself, dress well but barely make any actual progress while someone with a jawline and extra few inches (vertical, not horizontal) get attention even while wearing a potato sack and looking like they haven't shaved in years.

People will say you have a shitty attitude, try to put the blame on you, call you insecure but dont believe everything they say. Nonetheless, the only way to let go of this bitterness is to accept that most women are spoilt for choices nowadays (again, fault of men only for being down to fuck anyone with a pulse) and they have a right to set  their standards, even ones who you think are conventionally unattractive themselves. There is nothing wrong if she chooses who she wants from her options. You are not entitled to affection or sex or anything really. Women don't owe you a thing.

Now coming to escort services, it is a perfectly valid alternative if you have enough money to spare. Best is to go for independent escorts only, without any middleman involved. No one should be shamed for entering into such a transactional relationship. The only concerned parties are you and the woman. Its completely understandable if you don't want to deprived of any sexual contact throughout your 20s (or more, god forbid) for reasons beyond your control and you feel these services are the only option left.

Trust me, you will feel better and lead a better life as long you don't get carried away. Its far better than letting bitterness and despair consume you. Do what's best for you. Try not get swayed by people (irl or online) who try to convince you that you are a bad person or misogynist or whatever for engaging in such practices. They are not in your shoes. Your life is not the same as them. They don't care if you remain a virgin. You are not guaranteed to be ""rewarded"" with anything if you go about things the ""right"" way, whatever that is. Women get attracted to whoever they want, which includes criminals and abusers. You can be the best version of yourself and it still doesn't guarantee you will get laid. Life simply doesn't work like that.

Life is unfair. Always think about what's best for yourself.

1hh7qyf,CMV: The recent Drone hysteria is manufactured to distract the people from the revolting against our Oligarchs.,"It's pretty clear what happened. Just 2-3 weeks ago, this country was on the verge of revolution. Both republican and democrat media outlets and oligarchs were attempting to frame Luigi as a terrorist that should be hated.   
  
But the people weren't buying it, as a huge portion of the population, whether democrat or republican, had been framing Luigi as a hero. Media outlets and oligarchs from all sides were visibly shitting bricks as they tried to get the people to see Luigi as a terrorist. They were completely failing, and for the first time, the proletariat seemed united and thirsty for change. 

Ironically, only weeks later, Media outlets like ABC started talking about ""drones"" and ""UFOs"", even showing an out of focus video of Venus and attempting to claim it was a drone/UFO/UAP. Pictures of lights in the sky that were obviously from planes or consumer drones. It's not like we just had Black Friday, which likely led to record drone sales as they've become more accessible and affordable. 

Suddenly, the majority of people seem to have completely forgotten the class war that we were just on the verge of. Now everyone's obsessing over lights in the sky, and the oligarchs are likely sleeping more peacefully.

1hhai1y,CMV: No amount of gun violence deaths will result in political change and people should stop expecting it,"Every time there' is a major mass casualty incident in the United States caused by a firearm you constantly see people saying that it will be a ""Wakeup call"" and that it will somehow inspire change.

You can change my view if you convince me that people don't say that or don't believe it.

My view is that there is no specific amount of people that have to die in order to inspire meaningful change or legislation. Even after the Mandalay Bay Massacre in Las Vegas when 59 people were killed and more than 500 others injured, nothing happened.

You can change my view if you can convince me that there is a certain number that would inspire change.

The people who have the ability to make change simply don't care. They could put the effort in, but the deaths of everyday Americans does not justify that effort for them. They will continue to get elected no matter what, so they don't bother. Why hurt their political career when they could just sit in office and focus on other issues. Of course there are other important issues, so they can go handle those instead.

You can change my view if you can convince me that they do care. 

The people who have the ability to make a change will never be in danger of being impacted by gun violence. Politicians at high levels are protected, and at low levels usually come from privileged positions and will never face the threat of gun violence. They might deeply care about the issue, of have loved ones affected, but they themselves will never face that danger or experience fear of gun violence so they simply won't act. It doesn't apply to them. 

You can change my view if you can convince me that gun violence does impact politicians.

To conclude, no amount of dead Americans will inspire meaningful change. No amount of dead kids will make the politicians care. No amount of blood will make them act, unless of course it's blood of their own.

1hjhtug,CMV: The 2020s has been and will be viewed as a terrible decade ,"My overall feelings on the 2020s decade will be no more or less different from the majority of people when I say that of all the decades that has transpired throughout modern time, this decade has, by far, been a consistent disaster, one after another, with a general pessimistic vibe that even in future retrospects, it will be objectively viewed as an unlikable era that will never be looked back at fondly. I will admit that despite the past decades' major downsides, they are viewed much more favorably based on various statements, regardless of the age group – from the amount of analysis I had conducted in my research, it is immensely rare to hear about how decades such as the 1980s and the 1990s are viewed negatively in the same vein as the 2020s; the disdain for the latter couldn't be more overstated as I had underwent personal struggles with anxiety and depression from recent current events. Even when I struggled from my mental disability in my childhood, I still viewed the past rather fondly. Granted, there is a theoretical chance that I could be just viewing the past with 'rose-tinted glasses', I find it to be practically impossible to imagine the 2020s to be viewed so fondly in retrospects given the overly negative reception with many past events in comparison.

So far, the 2020s decade has given people the pandemic and its after-effects within society, political unrest along with radical polarization, increased social isolation leading to depression and increased risks of suicide, the gradual erosion of democracy with cases such as Afghanistan and Myanmar, inflation along with massive corporate consolidation over housing, multiple genocides and wars, the countless mass shootings happening within the United States, skyrocketing cost of living, the increasing gap of wealth gap inequality, erosion of certain rights such as abortion, greenhouse gas emissions have increased global average temperatures, and that’s only to list a few. I understand that horrible events in the past have happened as well - it's just that so much bad has happened from this decade alone that it seems to make the events of the past pale in comparison.  I just find that the world, let alone this decade, is seemingly bleak and will not be looked back at admirably with the exception of the young adolescents and individuals that have been raised in a high class privileged lifestyle.

Ideally, there is testimony from research groups backed up by data that society as a whole is supposedly better off than before from the decrease of extreme poverty, fewer people dying in conflicts in recent decades than in most of the 20th century, the ever-advancing medical treatments against fatal illnesses, increased life expectancy along with decreased child mortality rate; those aspects are taken for granted admittedly. However, the general vibe that I have felt recently is anything but positive – I noticed that people are generally depressed overall due to various factors that have been listed. I read that the same group of adults aged 18-35 in general will note that their time in certain past decades that they lived in at that time positively whereas another group of adults within the same age bracket will persistently state that the 2020s is a terrible time to be living in. Even from reading about older generations that have lived through certain rough times with the Great Depression, the World Wars, the looming threat of the Cold War, segregation, apartheid, communism with Eastern Europe, the Vietnam War, the AIDS epidemic that those periods of time, they would state that this time of era is even worse than they they lived through which really puts the 2020s in such a negative light.

To put it in layman's terms, I am filled with confidence that the 2020s is generally despised now and that it will never be - this decade's overall vibe and reception will be no different than the 1930s.

Women can lie just as much as men. Women can have hidden agendas just as much as men. Women are just as capable as men of bringing frivolous lawsuits against men. At least, that's what the core principles of feminism would suggest. 

If it's innocent until proven guilty everywhere else, and we're allowed to speculate on accusations everywhere else... why are SA allegations different? Wouldn't that be special treatment to women and be... sexist? 

I don't want to believe all women blindly. I want to give them the respect of treating them as intelligent individuals, and not clump them in the ""helpless victim category"" by default. I am a sceptical person, cynical even, so I don't want to take a break from critical thinking skills just because it's an SA allegation. All crime is crime, and should ideally be treated under the same principle of 'innocent until guilty'.

When it comes to parents from other countries and cultures, like Hispanics, Asians, and Indians just to name a few, it's talked about more casually and not condemned as much due to it being ""part of their culture"" (seriously look up videos and shorts on you-tube of people from other cultures casually joking about how their parents beat them and emotionally, and verbally abused them). I'm not trying to be ignorant or stereotype other people's culture but why are we so tolerant of abuse from nonwhite people, instead of condemning it. Also we see a good chunk of white people cut contact with their abusive parents when they reach adulthood (again rightfully so) however that rate is nowhere near the same with Minority kids as a good chunk of them I've seen online actually spend time, and act all friendly with their parents as if they forgot what they put them through and some of them even excuse it as ""they just showed their love in a different way"".

1hkrean,CMV: The man who set a woman alight on the New York subway deserves to die,"I never believed in capital punishment until today, but this guy single handedly converted me.

Burning someone to death is just about the worst thing you can do to them. It is the most excruciating way to die. 

Doing that to an innocent bystander is unconscionable. In fact, that's an understatement. There are no words to describe it. It's beyond comprehension. It's unspeakable.

This murder doesn't just deprive a woman of her life. It hurts every single woman on the planet. Every day, women have to live in ever greater fear of being attacked. This act compounds that problem and actually makes it more likely further attacks will occur. I would argue that everyone suffers as a consequence of that reality.

There are two reasons why the attacker should be tortured to death. 

Firstly, as a deterrent. You will make women - and the general population - safer by punishing this murderer. Something has to be done to protect women and a painful, inhumane death will go some way to achieving that. But all this pales in comparison to the second reason. That reason is retribution.

The world gains nothing from this man's existence. His continued being does nothing whatsoever to assuage any of the pain society experiences as a consequence of his actions. And it does nothing to address the extraordinary cost those actions inflicted on the victim.

From a utilitarian, never mind a moral perspective, there is an imperative to punish this man. The only way to do that - and the only way to gain any semblance of justice and utility from the situation - is to inflict the maximum amount of pain on him. At least then we can in some way alleviate the mental anguish and suffering of society as a whole.

While plenty of communities cater to other ways of thinking, the general culture of Reddit is slanted left. It's become sort of an echo chamber for those ideas, and alternative views really don't get much traction.

First off, many of the most popular subreddits on Reddit have to do with progressive or socialist issues. Places like r/politics, r/antiwork, and r/latestagecapitalism are filled with posts railing against capitalism, billionaires, and big corporations. The discussions go beyond just pointing out problems, too—they can get really extreme. You see and hear people quite vociferously saying that billionaires don't deserve to exist and calling CEOs-bankrupting industries for profit, specifically the ones dealing in healthcare-are something people say quite easily; from basic 'Billionaires deserves to lose everything' comments up to and including outright physical or other forms of suggested violence. These posts gain thousands of upvotes, so they are on the front page, reinforcing the leftist vibe.

The voting system on Reddit makes the echo chamber effect even worse. If someone posts a comment or opinion that doesn't fit the dominant narrative-like a conservative or moderate take-it's usually downvoted so hard it disappears. On the other side, everything that corresponds to the popular left-leaning view is upvoted and moved to the top. That means just one side of the argument is really seen, while opposing viewpoints get buried or ignored. Over time, this just discourages people with different perspectives from even bothering to engage. Why post something if it's just going to get downvoted into oblivion?

Then, of course, there is the huge role of moderation in giving shape to the overall tone of the platform. Large subreddits are run by their moderators, who are themselves often very left-leaning. They can be very quick to remove posts or ban users if they don't agree with the content, even when it doesn't break any rules. Such moderation makes a one-sided space where alternative viewpoints are not just unpopular but also actively suppressed. It's unsurprising that people view Reddit as a hostile place for anyone who doesn't align with progressive values.

Another reason has to do with the makeup of the site's users: The users go for a younger, more technologically hip audience that can easily go to the left on social issues and politics. Users interact and upvote this content as it speaks for their views, only to increase the presence of the left on this site. Now, for those right-leaning areas of Reddit-areas such as r/Conservative or r/libertarian-they exist but pale in size to the big left leaning behemoths.

At the end of the day, Reddit is not completely bereft of other viewpoints, but the way the site is structured makes it incredibly hard for them to be heard. From the voting system to the heavy-handed moderation to the demographics of the user base, Reddit has devolved into a leftist echo chamber where everything else is drowned out. No surprise there, really, when people think of it that way.

1hkwd3q,"CMV: The Democrats are not a ""right-wing"" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries.","This is something you here all the time on Reddit, and from people on the left generally, that the Democrats are actually a ""right-wing"" party on the international level and somehow their policies would be center right in other post-industrial democracies. People can arguable about the specifics of ""right-wing"" and ""left-wing"" so the more precise case I'm making is that the policy goals of the Democratic party are not out of step or somehow way further to the right compared to other mainstream, center-left parties in Europe or other Western democracies. If the policies of the Democratic party were transported to the United Kingdom or Germany, they would be much closer to Labour or the SPD and aren't going to suddenly fit right in with the Tories or the CDU. 

I will change my view if someone can read the [2024 Democratic platform](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FINAL-MASTER-PLATFORM.pdf) and tell me what specific policy proposals in there would not be generally supported by center-left parties in Europe or other Western democracies. 

In 2020, Biden ran on a platform that included promises like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, providing universal pre-k, making community college and public four year universities free, creating a public option for health insurance, among other things. Biden's primary legislative accomplishments were passing massive fiscal stimulus through the American Rescue Plan and infrastructure law and a major subsidies for green energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. He also expended a bunch of political capital on a plan for widespread student loan forgiveness that even other Democratic politicians conceded went beyond the scope of the Executive Branch's powers. I don't see how any of these things can be considered remotely right-wing. Even left-wing commentators like Ezra Klein at the New York Times have said that the Biden administration has been the most progressive administration ever in American history.

I think the assertion that Democrats are ""right-wing"" is mostly the result of people fundamentally misunderstanding the major differences between the American political system and the parliamentary systems practices in most other western democracies. The filibuster makes it so, that in practice, any major policy proposal requires bipartisan support. The last time the Democrats had a filibuster proof majority was back in 2009, which they promptly lost in like a year after a special election in Massachusetts. With their filibuster proof majority, the Democrats used it to pass the Affordable Care Act. Say what you will about the ACA, you can believe it didn't go far enough, but I don't really see how it be remotely construed as ""right-wing.""

Meanwhile, the majority party in most parliamentary systems is able to pass pretty much whatever they want with a 50%+1 majority, provided they can get their party/coalition in line. The logic people seem to employ when they argue that the Democrats are right-wing are they identify progressive policies that America doesn't have that other countries do have like single-payer healthcare, universal parental leave, etc and then reason backwards to conclude that the Democrats must be right-wing. But the Democrats explicitly call for many of these policies in their party platform, it's just virtually impossible to pass most of these things because of the Senate filibuster. 

As an additional note about healthcare, it's worth pointing out that many European countries do not have nationalized, single-payer systems use a mix of private and public healthcare options. The big examples are Germany and Switzerland. Even countries with single-payer systems like Canada still use private health insurance for prescription drugs and dental work. Just because the Democrats seem confused on whether they want to whole-heartedly embrace as Sanders style ""medicare for all"" isn't prima facia evidence that the party would somehow be right-wing in Europe. 

Finally, the Democratic party is arguably much further to the left on many social issues. One of the biggest examples is abortion. It's not clear what, if any, restrictions on abortion that Democratic party endorses. In states that have a Democratic trifecta in the governor's mansion and supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature, abortions are often effectively legal at any point, provided you can find a sympathetic doctor to provide a ""good-faith"" medical judgement that completing the pregnancy would harm the health of the mother. 

The viability standard set in Casey of around 24 weeks gave the US a significantly more generous timeframe to get an elective abortion, whereas most European countries cap it [around 12 weeks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1268439/legal-abortion-time-frames-in-europe/). Many European countries also require [mandatory counseling or waiting periods](https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/European-abortion-law-a-comparative-review.pdf) before women can get abortions, something the Democrats routinely object to. For comparison, the [position](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/europe/germany-abortion-recommendation-intl/index.html) of the Germany's former left-wing governing coalition was the abortions up until 12 weeks should be available on demand, provided the woman receives mandatory counseling and waits for three days. If a Republican state set up that standard in the US, the democrats would attack it relentlessly as excessively draconian, which is precisely what they've done to North Carolina, which has an extremely similar [abortion law](https://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/en/abortion-guide-access) on the books.",ThePurpleNavi,358,0.6100000143051147,890,1734984967,2024-12-23 14:16:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hkwd3q/cmv_the_democrats_are_not_a_rightwing_party_and/,12,2024
1hln8gs,CMV: Republicans will hold a permanent Senate majority for the foreseeable future,"In recent years, the red state–blue state polarization has become more and more locked in. We are now at a point of having no Democratic Senators from red states (and one Republican from a blue state, Susan Collins in Maine). At the moment, there are 24 safe red states, 18 safe blue states, and 7 swing states. This gives Republicans a baseline of 48 Senators, and it means the math no longer works for Democrats. They must hold 12 of 14 swing state Senate positions at once to make it to 50, which would be broken by the Vice President only if Democrats hold presidential office. It just doesn’t add up for Democrats. Barring Texas, Florida, Ohio pipe dreams, Democrats are simply not competitive in any red state.

Obviously, this cripples any Democratic presidents in the near future and weakens the party nationally, as even winning the presidency will not allow Democrats to make any legislative progress since they cannot hold the Senate as well. This further strengthens Republican dominance, as they are the only ones who can get anything done.

The resistance of the national Democratic Party to change and its unwillingness to upset corporate donors and interested groups seems to only cement this and shut down future arguments about how parties adapt—they don’t WANT to adapt. They have little reason to as long as they can fundraise successfully.",ahedgehog,207,0.7599999904632568,264,1735076688,2024-12-24 15:44:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hln8gs/cmv_republicans_will_hold_a_permanent_senate/,12,2024

1hm1w21,CMV: People telling you to see obese people as people is not promoting obesity,"I am sick and fucking tired of the thinkpieces I see in here! The body positivity movement was created to tell overweight people that they should not hate themselves. If they wanted to promote obesity, they would only spread excessive mukbang content, but that clearly isn't the case. To say fat people are human and deserve to be treated with basic fucking respect is not a radical thought. Some of the most unhealthy eaters I know with high cholesterol, high blood pressure, pre diabetes, GERD, and perspiration issues are skinnier than me or socially acceptable. I know a woman whose who diet is Cheetos and mac and cheese. Girl is so backed up and constipated, she literally poops once a week and it is one giant hard log. Yet when we are next to each other, people unsolicitedly compare our bodies. 

Most fat people you'll meet are on a weight loss journey and I wish people were kinder. No wonder there was a body positivity movement. People are so freaking mean to fat people for existing! How do folks have an issue with other people's weight, idk. 

Unless you are a doctor or trainer, you shouldn't have anything to say about anyone's weight. Also, fat people deserve to smile and not have to deal with people being assholes. And if other people are being assholes, fat people have a right to ignore them and smile anyway.


Lil Segway below:


Sadly, I reached this conclusion when I became overweight. I was on meds and had deep depression so I ballooned from a solid 160 to 200 in the span of 4 to 5 years. To see the treatment I am receiving is jarring. I went from eating what I want to people micromanaging my food intake. I'll never forget when I got over a weight plateau and celebrated (lost 10 lbs) only for someone to come in and call me fat within hours and how I need to lose weight. Then for me to finally fit in a dress that I couldn't wear for over a year and still be told, ""You need to stop eating so much, you need to start exercising."" The ironic thing is that I was, which is why I could fit in more clothes lmfao. 

I've actively been eating less and spacing out my meals. My one dinner has become dinner for night one and night two. My breakfast has been spread out where half is breakfast and the other half is lunch. I do struggle with eating late because tbh I never finish my meals throughout the day, yet because I have a belly, I'm dragged for it. Plus it made me realize that people don't know what weight looks like. I've weighed myself before family dinners and I am the same exact weight as when I saw them months ago. Yet I walk in the door and people are yelling at me that I got fatter and need to stop eating. I'm glad the body positivity movement exists because I'm not going to let people make me feel like shit for being overweight right now, but I'm just tired.

1hn0ahj,Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor,"Illegal immigration causes competition for housing and wages among the poorest Americans. It creates downward pressure on wages and working conditions.

They are pretty much exploited by default. Immigrants on work visas are already exploited enough.

Every single study I have read on the matter says that illegal immigration provides a net benefit to the economy, but the ones that go into the details find that it's the wealthy people that receive the benefit by exploiting the workers more. The working class is generally negatively impacted by this, even if the economy does better overall

There is, at the same time, no real benefit we provide the world on a meaningful scale by accepting refugees. There are specific, local scenarios where we can absolutely have a meaningful impact by accepting refugees. 

The best example of this has been how we accept Haitians. There's been general bipartisan support for accepting these people as refugees, and even Trump extended the protections first doled out by Obama after the earthquake

However, when everyone tries to claim asylum, the alternative means of entering the US that was necessary for these Haitians after their airport was shut down was made not viable. 

The only people who truly benefit off of Illegal immigration are the wealthy that exploit them for their labor

I hate the idea that we profit off the exploitation of a lower class of people

I'm open to all sorts of immigration reform but I do not wish to engage on the subject of opening up more legal avenues for immigration",Particular-Pen-4789,271,0.6600000262260437,567,1735253390,2024-12-26 16:49:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hn0ahj/cmv_proillegal_immigration_sentiments_are/,12,2024

1hpuw7y,"CMV: ""YYYY-MM-DD"" is a superior date format to ""DD-MM-YYYY""","You may have seen [this meme](https://imgur.com/5dYgqoE.png) before, explaining why the ""DD-MM-YYYY"" date format (commonly used in America) is superior to the ""MM-DD-YYYY"" format (commonly used in the US).  However, I think that it misses the mark a lot, and both of those formats are inferior to one that puts the year first, then the month, then the date (e.g. ""2024-12-30"")

I think this format is better than the other two for a few reasons:

* It matches how people normally express numbers.  Typically we express numbers in a way that is [Big Endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness); we say the largest magnitude part of the number first, then descending down to the smallest part.  For example, if you want to write the number five million and one, you would write it as 5,000,001.  You start with the ""5"" (which has the biggest magnitude, since it counts millions) and end with the ""1"" (since it has the smallest magnitude and counts ones).  The DD-MM-YYYY date format flips this (kind of, see below) and starts with the smallest magnitude and goes to the largest.

* When I said it flips it, that's only kind of true.  The numbers are still big-endian for each individual part of the date.  For example, writing the current year as ""2024"" is big-endian.  It starts with the 2 (which represents thousands of years, the largest magnitude piece of information), followed by the ""0"" for hundreds, the next ""2"" for tens, and then the ""4"" for ones.  It's big-endian, descending magnitude.  And the month and date parts are also big-endian.  So when you write with DD-MM-YYYY, you don't really end up with a big-endian or small-endian date format.  It's a small-endian collection of individual date parts which are themselves big-endian, resulting in a mixed-endian result where the magnitudes go up and down (much like the pyramid on the right side of the meme posted at the top).

* If you add in time-of-day, it becomes even more clear that you're going up and down in terms of magnitude.  We write time of day in HH:MM:SS format.  As far as I know, there's no country where SS:MM:HH is preferred.  This is big-endian, starting with the largest magnitude and then moving down from there.  If you list the date in ""DD-MM-YYYY"" format, and include the time, then you're always going to have a format where it goes up and down.  Either ""HH:MM:SS DD-MM-YYYY"" or ""DD-MM-YY HH:MM:SS""  Both of these are ""out of order pyramids"" in the illustration above.

* ""YYYY-MM-DD"" also has the nice advantage in the fact that, if you sort filenames or other pieces of data in a simple alphanumeric way, then you are also putting them in chronological order.  The other two date formats don't have this.

Ultimately, the only advantage that I can think of that DD-MM-YYYY has over YYYY-MM-DD is ""but it's what some people are already used to, so why change?"", which is incidentally the exact same reason people choose MM-DD-YYYY over DD-MM-YYYY.   

So change my view.",kabukistar,356,0.7699999809265137,292,1735586042,2024-12-30 13:14:02,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hpuw7y/cmv_yyyymmdd_is_a_superior_date_format_to_ddmmyyyy/,12,2024

1hsaw8u,CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries,"Based on my personal experience, what I've been hearing from my relatives, friends and co-workers, and also what I've read online on various forums, blogs, social media posts, I strongly believe that non-white countries are a lot more ignorant toward ""minorities"" or people who are considered non-white. In modern days most white countries would gladly accept immigrants and politically and socially they have dedicated laws and resources that are meant to help immigrants. Since the majority of white countries have a history of colonizing the world, modern history and social culture focus a lot on the sentiment of accepting people who are different than you, or simply the idea of racial/ethnic diversity and inclusion when it comes to representation and treatment. The school system or general education emphasizes on that, and all the organizations and firms would also follow and do the same(even if they have ulterior motive/not being genuine). As long as you grow up in a modern environment, you will learn about racism and that miniorities are perceived as ""vulnerable"" and there is this idea of treating people with respect no matter their cultural background, skin color, language etc.

Most white countries are diverse and have a lot of non-white citizens and migrants who yet to obtain their documents. In contrast, non-white countries are less immigrant-friendly and hence the society generally is not very aware of the aforementioned ideology/concept related to diversity, inclusion, racism etc. 

In Japan for example, there are restaurants can out right say no to people who look foreign(especially those with darker skintones) to them and use the ""no foreigner"" excuse to deny non-Japanese customers in the disguise of xenophobia. Such excuse would not be acceptable in western society. If a restaurant owner from UK, France, U.S, Canada denies someone who is foreign from entering their restaurant just because they are a foreigner or in the worst case that they believe they look foreign by their ethnicity, they will get sued and exposed on social media, and by laws and societal standards they will lose their license to operate. 

A Taiwanese friend of mine also told me that he has experienced way more casual/systematic racism in Congo than in other european countries he has lived in(he travels around because he works as an intepreter for a logistic company). From being stopped by police and asked to pay dirty money since he looks asian, to being denied rental housing even though his paperwork was perfect to Congolese casually pulling their eyes and mimick chinese person speaking, the incident amount is absurd as opposed to what he experienced in Canada, U.S and New Zealand. Such contrast of racist incidents are also reported a lot by my other friends who are from different ethnicities and a particular Pakistani friend who has very dark skin of mine said he was denied multiple jobs when he was working in UAE because his employers outright prefer to hire white caucasian, arab or even east asian workers because ""it makes the company looks more professional"". There are no specific laws that will define prejudice/racism in many context in these countries and even if they are, many can get away with it and the society as whole does not put enough emphasis to fight agianst racial/ethnic discirmination like what the western society does.

In conclusion, I believe non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries, and its not just limited to casual, day to day personal racism but also systematic racism. (See how China can outright limits the freedom of any ethnic minorities or lock away foreigners as the authority deems so, or that African countries can infringe the rights of white/non-black citizens or that the fact non-white countries do not have enough immigrant politicians in the government because people do not vote for them and they gain no power and favorism even in elections etc).",padorUWU,1880,0.800000011920929,810,1735868750,2025-01-02 19:45:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hsaw8u/cmv_nonwhite_countries_are_a_lot_more_racist_than/,1,2025

The use of crypto as a currency completely defies the definition of currency as it doesn’t hold a stable value.

I don’t mean to sound like the liberal who just complains about republicans either, please don’t just agree with me in the comments and crap on conservatives, I actually do not understand why they believe we should stop sending money to Ukraine. The arguments against it as I’ve heard have been:

1. We should be spending it here in America. Which I don’t understand why the 60billion that was proposed was too much foreign aid as it is roughly 1% of the budget. The U.S. military receives dozens of times more money in our annual budget to accomplish the same goal as the aid to Ukraine: protect American, our allies and our interests around the world.

2. The war has gone on long enough and we should stop funding a brutal meat grinder. I could be on board with this if it weren’t for the fact that A. Ukraine is the country that was invaded B. We supplied the saudis long protracted war against the Houthis that went nowhere and we’ve been giving Israel billions in aid money for decades just so they can fight a never ending war. Yet for some reason the war that involves the largest source of misinformation and propaganda is the one people have grown tired of?

1hvpmcx,"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media","As far as I understand, the US Congress is trying to ban TikTok because they believe that a big Chinese-owned social media site/app is dangerous because the Chinese government might use it to spy on Americans and push propaganda to them.

I am not trying to be pro-China nor anti-China, but it is undeniable that the political relations between the USA and China are not great, and they are likely to get worse under the new Trump regime. Hence it is within the realm of reason for Americans to be be wary of Chinese agendas. (Again, I do not mean to be anti-Chinese.)

However, in my opinion, all the arguments I have heard about Chinese social media also apply to American social media. From my perspective as a European, the USA is a foreign power led by a dangerously unpredictable right-wing extremist. Elon Musk (who controls Twitter) is a close Trump-supporter, and as far as I can tell Mark Zuckerberg (who controls Facebook) also supports Trump. I don't know about the owners of other major social media such as YouTube or Reddit, but I do not trust any of these people. Any of these might ally with Trump and use their platforms to spread propaganda to support a Trumpist ideology. That could cause a lot of damage to my country and others.

If Chinese-owned social media are dangerous, then American-owned social media are just as dangerous. Especially under Trump, but also without Trump. Hence, if it is reasonable for the US Congress to regulate or ban TikTok, then it is just as reasonable for European countries to regulate or ban American-owned social media such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and also Reddit. 

(One problem, of course, would be that there is not much left. But I am not worried about that. In a hypothetical scenario where the EU bans all non-EU-controlled social media, a few EU-based ones would soon rise to replace them.)

1hvu7na,CMV: Western countries are the least racist countries in the world,"So unlike what much of Reddit may want you to believe Western countries by and large are actually amongst the least racist countries on earth. So when we actually look at studies and polls with regards to racism around the world we actually see that the [least racist countries](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/least-racist-countries) are actually all Western countries, while the [most racist countries](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/most-racist-countries) are largely non-Western countries.

In some of the largest non-Western countries like China or India for example racism is way more prevalant than it is in the West. In China for example they openly show ads like[ this one ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36394917)on TV and in cinemas, where a Chinese woman puts a black man into a laundry machine and out comes a ""clean"" fair-skinned Chinese man. 

And in India colorism still seems to be extremely prevelant and common place, with more dark-skinned Indians often being systemtically discriminated against and looked down upon, while more light-skinned Indians are typically favored in Indian society.

And Arab countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar or United Arab Emirates according to polls are among the most racist countries on earth, with many ethnic minorities and migrant workers being systemtically discrimianted against and basically being subjected to what are forms of slave labor. Meanwhile the least racist countries accroding to polls are all Western countries like New Zealand, Canada or the Netherlands.

Now, I am not saying that the West has completely eliminated racism and that racism has entirely disappeared from Western society. Surely racism still exists in Western countries to some extent. And sure the West used to be incredibly racist too only like 50 or 60 years ago. But the thing is the West in the last few decades by and large has actually made enormous progress with regards to many social issues, including racism. And today Western countries are actually by and large the least racist countries in the world.

1hwv4lp,CMV: Disney should make new movies with minority leads instead of race swapping in remakes ,"Literally the title. I’m a huge Disney fan but this is so lazy. I feel like if they actually cared about inclusion and representing minorities, they’d make original stories that represent them, not the half assed remakes that they’re using for cash grabs. I’m not one of those “why is Disney woke now 😡” kind of people, I’m happy to see more representation but I just hate how they’re doing it. Race swapping white characters like Ariel the mermaid and Hercules in live action remakes is just a dead giveaway that they’d rather take the easy way out instead of actually taking time to make fresh stuff. 

I feel like Disney was more inclusive back when they didn’t try so hard. Stuff like Pocahontas, Mulan, Lilo & Stitch and Princess and the frog. It felt real. Now it just feels so forced that many are unable to appreciate it. 

With only making remakes with minority leads instead of taking time to make them their own original princess/ main character I feel like they’re basically saying “you’re not worth the time of a new project”. Why can’t they just continue with things like Encanto, Moana, and Wish? Have they ran out of ideas or something?

1hwzoat,"CMV: Trump is not fit to be the face of America, let alone the president.","This post is really just relevant to American users, but I'd like to hear the opinions of anybody outside the country if they do have a say. I, personally, do not understand how people can openly support Trump with the vast amount of information out there that definitely does not paint him as a good person. I've seen most supporters say that they voted for him hoping for cheaper gas prices, groceries, and to ""Make America Great Again."" I believe the country has never truly been great and needs much work, but that is an entirely different conversation.  
 Even if I did believe Trump could and would do everything his supporters are hoping for, I would not vote for him. Why? He was openly a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein for, according to Epstein himself, 10 whole years. There are clips of the two of them talking about women's looks - which I doubt their conversations were respectful after the ""grab 'em by the pussy"" comment. Trump says these exact words about Epstein: ""I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy... It is even said that he likes women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."" I'm not saying that Trump was a part of Epstein's crimes, but I would not be surprised if such news were to ever be revealed. I am simply pointing out who he has been associated with - for example, Matt Gaetz, who was said to have paid a 17-year-old girl for sex. Trump has faced similar allegations of sexual assault since 1970- 26 different allegations, to be exact. He has denied all of them, but considering the people he is around and the things he has said, it is very hard to believe him. As just about everyone knows, he IS a convicted felon.  
 America might need the cheaper gas prices, we might need the cheaper groceries, the walls, the need to be great, but is it truly worth putting the state of the country into the hands of a felon? The hands of a man that has likely touched and hurt women without a care in the world? Hands that shook with Jeffrey Epstein? No. I would truly love to know how anybody could ever choose that just for a cheaper life. ",Silent_Ice6040,482,0.6800000071525574,739,1736382170,2025-01-08 18:22:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hwzoat/cmv_trump_is_not_fit_to_be_the_face_of_america/,1,2025

* They gave very significant amounts of material to Ukraine, including F-16 fighter jets
* They allow US to have bases on their territory in Greenland and do whatever US wants there

1hz13nc,CMV: Obama laughing with trump is not something to be concerned about,"I’m not too desperate to get into most political talk, but people being concerned with Obama laughing at a joke by trump has been quite the stir recently. Ive seen posts on a few subreddits making the claim that the issue is not left or right, but classism, while using the photo of trump and Obama laughing at jimmy carters funeral. 

I’ve wanted to make the counter argument that the photo can be seen as a positive for Obama. I feel as though he has the capability to sit with anyone and perceive them as human. The ability to sit down and chat with your opposition is a positive trait that Obama uses as both leverage and assurity of level headedness from himself. 

I’m not going to deny the statement that class issues are a huge problem. Class inequality is what I believe to be one of our bigger issues in the United States and needs to be addressed. However, I do believe that Obama is not in the wrong for the ability to laugh at a joke by their opposition party, nor does it conclude that he is a problem with such an issue. In fact, I think that is something that Trump had begun to remove from the political scene compared to all other elections before his first run in 2016. You can compare political debates before the 2016 election and find more level headedness while still disagreeing.

I don’t see why it makes sense for a corporation to have a direct say in policy making in a democracy. A business owner himself may have interests and employees may have interests and they should on behalf of themselves have a say but a corporation sending lobbyists to do whatever magic it is that they do to sway politicians to do one thing or another doesn’t make sense to me if the governments chief concern is the people who vote/citizens. 

Enabling business entities to lobby officials on their behalf which inevitably is in the interest of profit seems like it compromises a politicians dedication to the people. Politicians are people after all and can be swayed , i think it makes sense to lessen the amount of possible swayers who are not the people governed. 

The lobbying and the exorbitant funding of these campaigns clearly sways the public officials interests a bit further to the interest of  private ownership benefit than i care for. It seems like it has produced an environment where the people are in a battle with corporate interests . 

The business entities seem to function as incredibly powerful super voters who have an advantage over the very group governments are supposed to function for. The government is feeling more and more like a privately owned interest group for business entities and less like a public good chiefly concerned with the people.

1hzwscm,CMV: American capitalism is severely flawed and exploitation of the working class is inherent to becoming a billionaire,"Throughout history, it has been evident that the capitalist economic philosophy of profit above all else, little/no government regulation, and letting the uber-rich hoard their incomprehensibly large amount of wealth is a leech on the well-being of society as a whole and leads to a constantly growing wealth divide not only within the scale of country, but on a global scale as well; a very clear divide between ""developed"" and ""less developed"" countries.

I can understand the philosophy behind the free market, having absolute equal distribution of wealth between everyone is ridiculous and creates stagnation in the development of a country. However, an unchecked wealth gap between the working and corporate/wealthy class creates turmoil and division amongst the people of a country. Throughout history, we can see that the uber-wealthy tend to use hatred against fellow people to distract the working class from who is really exploiting them; a scapegoat if you will. 

We can see in current day America that Donald Trump, a billionaire who is also endorsed by (and essentially a partner to) Elon Musk, the richest man on the planet, uses Mexican immigrants as a scapegoat for all the working man's troubles, Grocery prices, gas prices, inflation, etc, while creating tax cuts for the uber wealthy and killing welfare programs and departments, including the Department of Education. Despite the fact that deporting 10 million Mexican immigrants would cripple the American economy, the common working class white American believes it, simply because they are of a different culture and it is very easy to believe that they are the enemy because of human psychology.

The wealthy benefit from this because a working class that is too busy hating eachother is a working class that wont develop class consciousness. The billionaires will still cut corners at their companies and lobby to keep minimum wages stagnant as inflation slowly chips away at the value of the dollar, all while they grow wealthier. 

The unimaginable hoarding of wealth we see in the billionaire class is a cause for most of the economic troubles. There is no justification for one man to own as much wealth as millions of people while there are people who cant eat or drink. To be a billionaire, you must have exploitation at some point along the chain among at least one of their income streams, mainly their companies. Jeff Bezos is a prime example, a man acclaimed to have made his wealth ""by himself"", yet Amazon is notoriously one of the worst workplaces in the entire country for worker who make pennies to Bezos' millions.

I don't call for a total communist revolution within America, I just think that no person should have a billion dollars of wealth to their name no matter what they do as there's no reasonable justification for it that doesn't involve leeching off the working class. The corporate class should be taxed and regulated over ten-fold so that the capitol earned by the people is in the hands of the people.",itszesty0,322,0.6899999976158142,450,1736715517,2025-01-12 14:58:37,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hzwscm/cmv_american_capitalism_is_severely_flawed_and/,1,2025
1i0lzxk,CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically,"I'll start with Biden's legislature passed during his term and explain why I think his tenure did not meaningfully advance the goals of the American left. 

Biden's first signature piece of legislature was the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which in fairness to Biden is not your typical giveaway to the wealthy. It included child tax credits that were wildly successful, I believe they cut the child poverty rate by half. However, these expired.

Via The New York Times, reporting on the stimulus package at the time:

*For a working single mother of a 3-year-old who earns the federal minimum wage — just under $16,000 a year — the bill would provide as much as $4,775 in direct benefits, Ms. Pancotti estimates. For a family of four with one working parent and one who remains unemployed because of child care constraints, the benefits could total $12,460.*

It was also refreshing to see after Trump's usually immodest boastings about his amazing soon to arrive infrastructure bill, that one was actually passed. Although the cost ($1 trillion) does seem excessive to me and it is irking that those who seemed to benefit most were large firms like CAT. 

Now the negatives:

the raw amount of spending is rather modest when put into perspective. Via Paul Krugman:

*But when I see news reports describe these laws as “*[*massive*](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/12/house-to-vote-on-inflation-reduction-act-tax-and-climate-bill.html)*” or huge, I wonder whether the writers have done the math. The infrastructure law will add* [*roughly $500 billion*](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/infrastructure-plan-will-add-400-billion-deficit-cbo-finds) *in spending over the next decade. The Inflation Reduction Act will increase spending by roughly* [*an additional half trillion*](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-inflation-reduction-act)*. A law to promote U.S.* [*semiconductor production*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-28/house-sends-52-billion-chip-bill-to-biden-for-his-signature?sref=qzusa8bC) *will add around $50 billion more. Overall, then, we’re talking about a bit more than $1 trillion in public investment over 10 years.*

*To put this in perspective, the Congressional Budget Office expects* [*cumulative gross domestic product*](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-05/57950-Outlook.pdf#page=13) *to be more than $300 trillion over the next decade. So the Biden agenda will amount to around one-third of one percent of G.D.P. Massive it isn’t.*

I am of the opinion that the CHIPS and Sciences Act was unnecessary or at least should have been amended as some Democratic senators suggested so that the chips companies receiving the subsidies didn't turn around and use the federal money on buybacks and dividends.

Speaking of stock buybacks, Biden's 1% tax on stock buybacks was welcome but in my opinion too modest to alter a practice that could potentially damage American competitiveness for the long term (as companies like IBM are spending more on buybacks than R&D)

I'm not sure what the ideal solution is to this (and obviously some of this is down to California's jurisdiction and its governor) but it doesn't seem to reflect well on Biden that in California the average home price is $700,000, which cannot be good for the average person. Recently, figures have also come out that US homelessness has risen to an all time high of 770,000. 

Wage growth adjusted for inflation on paper has been impressive (7.3% for the bottom 10% since 2019) it is  important to note that often the cost of living increases for these individuals have probably been greater than the official inflation statistics (grocery prices make up only 8% of the CPI but the average person in the bottom 10% spends more than 8% of their budget on groceries).

Biden cannot really be faulted for the nearly $400 billion in climate spending though in the IRA, good job there. 

Biden's student loan forgiveness plan (though this was not really his fault) ended up being hacked to pieces by the Supreme Court. 

Regulatory outlook:

Lina Khan's FTC came in with an ambitious plan to rewrite existing US antitrust practice. The results have been decidedly mixed. Lawsuits against Microsoft and Meta failed. A good symbol of where policy has become misguided under Biden is that the FTC sued to block the Tapestry-Capri Holdings merger over whether prices for affordable handbags would become too high.

Tyler Perry (a billionaire) is pushing this rhetoric, stating recently: *""Does anyone else find it appalling that insurance companies can take billions of dollars out of communities for years and then, all of a sudden, be allowed to cancel millions of policies for the very people they became rich on?""*

The problem? In the last decade in California, for every $1.00 insurers have collected in premiums, they've paid out $1.09 in claims. Not only have they not made any money, they've suffered *heavy losses*. 

**Myth #2:** ""They're canceling these people's policies so they don't have to pay the claims!""

Outside of non-payment of premiums or fraud, California law prohibits insurers from canceling an insurance policy *during its term*. 

What they're canceling is the *renewal* of the policy. 

**Myth #3:** ""They're just *greedy*!"" 

* Over the past decade, the average combined ratio for the U.S. homeowners line was 101.3%, indicating insurers paid out more in claims than they received in premiums.

The last update in State Farm's wiki has their net revenue at a $5.5B *loss* (they're a prime target right now). Did they just forget to be greedy, then?

**Why did they cancel policies (renewals), refuse to take on more, and try to exit California altogether?** 

Because California made it impossible for them to function properly as an insurer. 

In 2017, voters passed a measure with support of the Newsom regime that heavily regulated the insurance industry under the guise of keeping home insurance ""affordable"". 

\- This required insurers to get approval from regulators before raising rates.   
\- They could only assess their rates based on historical losses in California, instead of forward-looking risk assessment  
\- California quickly became the worst state in the country for the disparity between actuary assessed rate (people who determine future risk and determine what premiums should be), and the regulatory approved rate.  
\- They delay for regulatory approval/rejection approached 300 days on average  
\- They were also prohibited (until very recently) from passing on the cost of reinsurance (insurance for insurance companies, basically) to customers. 

So the result was in effect the inability to function properly as an insurer, exposing themselves to catastrophic risk, and the necessity to pull out of these areas altogether less face bankruptcy. 

This has nothing to do with ""greed"". And if it does, the greed was on the part of Californians who thought they're too special to have to pay more for living in a disaster-prone area, and insurers should just be bending over backwards to lose money for their customer's benefit.

1i1qdgi,CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home ,"I think that Muslims who have immigrated to European nations and are now demanding Sharia Law (or the choice to be tried under Sharia) in that country should go back to their home countries. I’m a left leaning person and respect everyone’s religion and beliefs, but I don’t think they should be forced on others or the people who practice said religions should be harassing people who don’t follow the same. There have been protests lately in Germany where Muslims are demanding Sharia law, and polls show that a large number of middle eastern Muslim immigrants living in France, England, Denmark etc support bringing Sharia Law to those countries. I don’t believe that Sharia goes well whatsoever with western values, and I don’t think they should even have the option to be tried under sharia in these countries either. Sharia law includes things like: 

- Killing someone who decides to leave the Muslim faith 
- Not much freedom for Women 
- Sex before marriage is punishable by death 
- Homosexuality punishable by death
- Women unable to travel for more than a couple of days without a male guardian 
- Death Penalty/ Extreme over the top punishment for thieves 
- Grown men being able to marry young girls 

These things don’t align whatsoever with most western values.

If middle eastern immigrants in Europe (or anywhere else for that matter but mainly focusing on Europe rn) that are demanding Sharia Law should go back to their home countries or to a country that has Sharia if it’s that big of a deal to them. I just don’t see why they’re in a western country if they don’t agree with western values.

1i22ljg,CMV: People flocking to Rednote proves the Governments argument about the TikTok ban,"Most people believe the reason the Federal Government banned TikTok was because of data collection, which is for sure part of it, but that's not the main reason it was banned. It was banned because of concerns that a foreign owned social media app, particularly one influenced directly by a foreign Government can manipulate US citizens into behaving in a way that benefits them.

No one knew what Rednote was 2 weeks ago in the US. All it took was a few well placed posts encouraging people to flock to a highly monitored highly censored app directly controlled by the CCP and suddenly an unknown app in the United States rocketed to the number 1 app in the country. 

This is an app that frequently removes content mentioning LGBTQ rights, anything they view as immodest, and any discussion critizing the CCP- a party actively engaging in Genocide against the Uyghurs. Yet you have a flood of young people who just months ago decried the US's response to the Gazan crisis flocking to an app controlled by a government openly and unapologetically engaging in Genocide. 

This was not an organic movement. If one is upset at the hamstringing of free speech their first reaction would not be to rush to an app that is controlled by a government that has some of the worst rankings of free speech globally. All it took was a few well placed posts on people's fyp saying ""Give the US the middle finger and join rednote! Show them we don't care!""

I think broadly society should have a mutually understood principle that even if you disagree or disapprove of someone's speech, they have the right to say it.

This includes supposed 'misinformation' and 'hate speech'.

As John Stuart Mill makes clear in On Liberty ""he who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that"", and ""“If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.”

Hate speech is a poorly worded and fascial set of legislation in the UK that can be used to prosecute anyone (including a young girl posting lyrics to a rap song and many teaching his dog to nazi salute as a joke - both of which have been arrested and prosecuted, though the former was released on appeal).

Ultimately a functioning society requires us to appreciate others views and allow them the space to air their beliefs, even if we believe they are wrong.

1i31opi,"CMV: Changing the correct term from ""homeless"" to ""unhoused"" does nothing to break the social stigma and is arguably a worse term","I want to open a discussion on the terms ""homeless"" and ""unhoused"" as I have seen many different opinions on this. Personally, I think it's counterproductive to call out people for being offensive because they use the term homeless for a few different reasons.

1. From an etymology standpoint, these words mean almost the same exact thing. House and home are synonymous. -Less means to be without, and un- means the opposite of. So homeless means to be without a home, and unhoused means you are not housed.
2. I think ""unhoused"" excludes people who choose to live with no stationary home. To me, homeless better describes this because it just means to be without a permanent dwelling. Unhoused, to me, could imply that the norm is housed and you are not. I think it can also imply you have become unhoused due solely to outside factors. Homeless, in my opinion, does not determine any fault or factor. It is simply to be without a permanent home. This is why I think it could be worse to use ""unhoused"" as that word has a higher chance of having a connotation attached to it.
3. Changing this term does nothing to help the homeless/unhoused population. Because they have similar definitions, no social stigma is decreased in changing it. Homeless is not a slur. Instead of bringing attention to programs and support for the population and trying to resolve the problem, it instead leads to mainly calling out others for being ""offensive"" to the population. Calling out others for being offensive is not a problem on it's own obviously; we should all be kinder to one another, and it's lead to getting rid of outdated hurtful words like the r word. But I do think it's an issue when there's almost no discernable difference between the words' meaning. It defies common sense.

1i53y3p,"CMV: TikTok is deliberately suppressing anti-China content, and this is sufficient to justify banning the app.","I've seen a lot of posts about TikTok recently, but relatively few posts with sources, so I thought I'd throw my hat into the ring.  [This substack article](https://thezvi.substack.com/i/142559317/tiktok-promoting-chinese-interests) was what convinced me of my current views.  It's very long, but I'll focus this CMV on what is IMO the strongest point.

In December 2023, a think tank did a [study](https://networkcontagion.us/wp-content/uploads/A-Tik-Tok-ing-Timebomb_12.21.23.pdf) comparing how common different hashtags are on Instagram and TikTok.  Using ordinary political topics like Trump, Biden, BLM, MAGA, etc as a baseline, they found a few significant differences (page 8), but nothing that I don't think could be explained by selection effects.

On the other hand, when they looked at content related to China, [they found a rather different pattern:](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F429fa831-69e8-4faf-bf10-7925282c513c_1042x759.jpeg)

- Pro-Ukraine, pro-Uighur, and pro-Taiwan hashtags are about 10x less common on TikTok as they are on Instagram.
- Hashtags about Tibet are about 25x less common.
- Hashtags about [Hong Kong](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a2856f7-af25-4f08-91cd-fe9a43bf51af_978x1003.png) and Tianenmen Square are over 100x (!!) less common.
- Conversely, hashtags about Kashmir separatism in India are [~1000x *more* common.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51e2a055-b3f3-43f5-8430-f0192da03e97_974x227.png) 

I don't think you can explain this with selection bias.  Absent a coordinated effort from everyone who posts about Tianenmen Square to boycott TikTok, a 100x difference is *far* too large to occur naturally.  The cleanest explanation is that the CCP is requiring TikTok--a Chinese company that legally has to obey them--to tweak their algorithm to suppress views they don't like.

I think this justifies banning TikTok on its own.  Putting aside the other concerns (privacy, push notifications in a crisis, etc), the fact that an unfriendly foreign country is trying to influence US citizens' views via content manipulation--and not just on trivial stuff, on major political issues--is an enormous problem.  We wouldn't let Russia buy the New York Times, so why let China retain control over an app that over a third of all Americans use?

(I'm fully aware that the US government has pressured US social media companies about content before.  That said, if my only options are ""my government manipulates what I see"" and ""my government *and* an unfriendly government manipulate what I see"", I would prefer ""nobody manipulates what I see"" but would settle for the former if that's not an option.)

Here's a few possible ways you could change my view (note: if you can give me links or sources I will be much more likely to award deltas):

- Find major problems with the posted studies that make me doubt the results.
- Convince me that the bill is problematic enough that it's not worth passing even if TikTok *is* manipulating content.
- Show that the US is pressuring social media companies to suppress anti-US content on a similar scale (this wouldn't change my views about banning TikTok, but it would change my views about the US).
- Convince me that most of the bill's support in Congress comes from reasons other than content manipulation and privacy (you'll need a good argument for how strong the effect is, I already know that e.g. Meta has spent boatloads lobbying for this bill but I'm not sure how many votes this has bought them).

1i59te1,CMV: Conservatives Will Dominate America for the Next ~20 Years,"Note: By “conservatives,” I mean both Republicans and conservative Democrats.

Trump’s win in November was resounding in every way except the final popular vote tally. Trump won every swing state, and every state moved to the right. Trump fell short of a true majority of the popular vote and only won it by 1.5 points, but it was still the first time a Republican won the popular vote since 2004. Additionally, Republicans won over millions of voters from majority-Democratic voting blocs.

Many left-leaning people have claimed, falsely, that Democrats lost due to low turnout. In truth, the 2024 election saw the second- highest turnout of any presidential election, and swing states like Georgia and North Carolina saw record turnout. By all metrics, the Harris-Walz team’s attempts to “get out the vote” worked. They successfully got out the vote… for Trump. Indeed, Trump won both Independents and first-time voters. Trump won *because* of high turnout. High turnout no longer benefits Democrats.

All post-election polling has suggested that Republicans are now the more popular party. Overall, America shifted to the right by four points in 2024. One poll found that 43 percent of voters viewed Democrats favorably and 50 percent viewed them unfavorably. Increasingly, Democrats are viewed as affluent, out-of-touch, college-educated elites who ask for votes and never return the favor. Most voters trust Republicans more on the economy, immigration, and crime. The economy and immigration were the two most important issues for voters last year. Most voters support mass deportations, which Trump has repeatedly promised to begin on day one. It’s obvious that MAGA has won over the majority of voters, which is also why Democrats are starting to move towards the center on issues, immigration chief among them.

The shifts among key demographics are even more alarming. Harris barely won a majority of the Latino vote, and most Latino men voted for Trump. Harris won Asians nationally, but Asians in Nevada shifted to the right by more than *50 points*. Democrats may have permanently lost the Muslim vote because Muslims hate ~~Jews~~ ~~Israel~~ “genocide,” and the recent ceasefire deal, in which Trump was apparently instrumental, might be the final nail in the coffin, especially considering Muslims’ social views make white evangelicals seem progressive. That could mean that Democrats will never again win Michigan. Other racial and religious groups, such as blacks and Jews, also shifted to the right by smaller amounts.

However, the most alarming shift is among young voters. According to the AP VoteCast, Harris only won young voters by 4 points; Biden carried them by more than 30. Young men especially are rapidly shifting towards the GOP. The reasons for this shift are debated, though many attribute it to perceived abandonment and/or demonization of men by the left. Also worth noting are the issues that are genuinely worse for men, such as the male suicide rate. For instance, the percentage of college students who are female now is roughly equal to the percentage of college students who were male prior to Title IX, and college enrollment among men is declining. More and more men are opting for trade schools instead, largely due to costs. This is important because college-educated people tend to be more liberal (the so-called “diploma divide”), while tradespeople tend to be very conservative. Lastly, since young voters’ views tend to be the most malleable, it stands to reason that more and more young voters will embrace MAGA.

This shift to the right is not limited to the US. In fact, the West as a whole is moving sharply to the right, largely for the same reasons as the US: the economy and immigration. The Conservatives are all but guaranteed to take control of Canada later this year and were even before Trudeau’s resignation. Although Labour took control of Parliament just last year, its popularity has already plummeted, and Reform UK’s popularity has surged. The SPD is poised to get voted out this year, and the AfD is becoming more popular by the minute. Now, the situation in Europe is different - and frankly, more dire - than the situation here in the States. Europe is currently facing widespread economic stagnation, and European society is being upended by immigration, particularly from the Islamic world. Similarly, largely unrestricted immigration in Canada has inflated home prices and created numerous social issues. As a result, left-wing parties haven’t been less popular since the Cold War, and right-wing populist parties who claim to have solutions are rapidly gaining popularity. Arguably, Trump’s comeback was the final nail in the coffin for the progressivism of the early century. At the time of writing, all signs point to a generation of right-wing dominance of America and the West as a whole.",Emperor_Kyrius,697,0.7099999785423279,1225,1737322633,2025-01-19 15:37:13,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i59te1/cmv_conservatives_will_dominate_america_for_the/,1,2025

the fact is, the US is very rich. it has ridiculous amount of disposable income, and while it is economically unequal, still most people have more purchasing power than in other developed countries. it is very good for doing business, inversting, it is very good compared to the world in LGBT laws and people's opinion on LGBT issues. it is one of the least racists countries in the world, if you travelled a lot you would know about it.

in my 18-20s I was very anti-USA, then I educated myself and put it in the top 10 best countries to live in. which is specially commendable giving its very large land area and population to manage. the single worst issue compared to other developed countries is security: homicides and its GPI is very much worse than other comparable countries. then in democracy, GINI, health it could be better. but in median income, GDP PPP, GDP PPP per capita, poverty rates, unemployment rates, HDI,  business, competitive, innovation indexes, economic freedom, etc. is a beast.

They are naive, fragile and inauthentic leaders of a cult.","Background: I once was an avid listener of ‘the rogansphere’ podcasts such as Joe Rogan, Lex Fridman and their friends. I stopped after realising that they are no longer some apolitical piece of individual media but something entirely else.
I have changed my mind to now be very anti-Rogan and I am amongst many male peers who are still in it or entering it. It was a phase for me and I hope it is for them too. 

My view: 
Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman are the kind of people who really like to appear as indifferent and open-minded but they have a really specific agenda. It seems as though their ideas of merit all come from martial arts, physical fitness, counter-academia, comedy and your willingness to partake in popular conspiracies. 

We all know Joe Rogan is not academic or by any means a genius, and he would even agree. But the fact that he uses his platform to encourage and broadcast ideas that he likes without any proper debating or counterpoints means that he is, intentionally or not, propagating an agenda. I’m afraid the usual argument of ‘it’s his podcast he can have whoever he wants on’ is just not acceptable now. His platform is too big and he should take responsibility for the ideas he is spreading.

Lex Fridman is a total worm. His monologues and soliloquies, I once saw as charming, are so naive, cringe and insufferable. A total narcissist who needs people to love him and view him as some innocent soul who only wants peace and love. He’s always like ‘I am trying my best’. Well do better, you have a massive platform and if you really want to be indifferent than be authentically indifferent rather than riding the coat tails of Rogan and Musk. He is just echoing the same agenda as the rest of the Rogansphere. The fact that in his podcast with President Zelenskyy, he has the nerve to question a world leader’s willingness to negotiate a peace deal with Russia in such a naive and holier-than-thou way just goes to show how these idiots aren’t equipped to ask proper questions and be reliable talk pieces for us to listen to. 

They also have massively contributed to division within the culture wars, much more so than what they claim ‘wokeness’ has.
They are becoming talk pieces for the far-right and seriously doing a lot more damage to the world than they are claiming.

Nazi isn’t a word that means “bad boogeyman” it means “someone who believes in their racial superiority, extreme protectionist nativism, the purifying of society by eliminating undesirables, expansionism, active suppression of dissent, and total state power held in the hands of a tiny group.”

1i852w8,"CMV: the term “Nazi” is an entirely appropriate approximate description of Trumpist Republicans based on a contemporaneous understanding of Nazi ideology, rather than a retrospective one.","Nazi isn't a generic slur. Neither does it require perfect specificity. Fascism itself is a collection of broad ideological goals, political tendencies, tactics, and aesthetics.

The idea of the Nazi as a cartoonishly evil villain stems from our retrospective understanding of what Nazism ultimately achieved. But for the average German citizen in the late 1920s-early 1930s, Nazism would have looked remarkably similar to Trumpism. The major exceptions are the nationalization of corporations and the explicit naming of Jews in the platform. The fact that today's GOP is smart enough to build on the Atwater/Nixon/Reagan Southern Strategy and not specifically call out racial and ethnic groups is a matter of tactics and degrees -- not a meaningful difference in ideology. In addition, you don't need to nationalize industry when you have a corporate oligarchy -- you can preserve the mythologies of capitalism while enjoying the benefits of corporate socialism. 

While some people may have reasonable concerns about the (over)use of the term ""Nazi"" to describe the American right today, many people who are pushing back against this language simply want cover to flirt with ideas and policies German Nazis would have loved. To advance the ideas without the label so those ideas appear respectable -- so they can rail against immigrants and trans people, remain in polite society and make extremism more acceptable. The rest are just pedants.

Here is the pre-war Nazi party platform:

1. We demand the union of all Germans in a Greater Germany on the basis of the right of national self-determination.
2. We demand equality of rights for the German people in its dealings with other nations, and the revocation of the peace treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain.
3. We demand land and territory (colonies) to feed our people and to settle our surplus population.
4. Only members of the nation may be citizens of the State. Only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation.
5. Non-citizens may live in Germany only as guests and must be subject to laws for aliens.
6. The right to vote on the State’s government and legislation shall be enjoyed by the citizens of the State alone. We demand therefore that all official appointments, of whatever kind, whether in the Reich, in the states or in the smaller localities, shall be held by none but citizens.
We oppose the corrupting parliamentary custom of filling posts merely in accordance with party considerations, and without reference to character or abilities.
7. We demand that the State shall make it its primary duty to provide a livelihood for its citizens. If it should prove impossible to feed the entire population, foreign nationals (non-citizens) must be deported from the Reich.
8. All non-German immigration must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who entered Germany after 2 August 1914 shall be required to leave the Reich forthwith.
9. All citizens shall have equal rights and duties.
10. It must be the first duty of every citizen to perform physical or mental work. The activities of the individual must not clash with the general interest, but must proceed within the framework of the community and be for the general good.
We demand therefore:
11. The abolition of incomes unearned by work.
The breaking of the slavery of interest
12. In view of the enormous sacrifices of life and property demanded of a nation by any war, personal enrichment from war must be regarded as a crime against the nation. We demand therefore the ruthless confiscation of all war profits.
13. We demand the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations (trusts).
14. We demand profit-sharing in large industrial enterprises.
15. We demand the extensive development of insurance for old age.
16. We demand the creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class, the immediate communalizing of big department stores, and their lease at a cheap rate to small traders, and that the utmost consideration shall be shown to all small traders in the placing of State and municipal orders.
17. We demand a land reform suitable to our national requirements, the passing of a law for the expropriation of land for communal purposes without compensation; the abolition of ground rent, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.
18. We demand the ruthless prosecution of those whose activities are injurious to the common interest. Common criminals, usurers, profiteers, etc., must be punished with death, whatever their creed or race.
19. We demand that Roman Law, which serves a materialistic world order, be replaced by a German common law.
20. The State must consider a thorough reconstruction of our national system of education (with the aim of opening up to every able and hard-working German the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement). The curricula of all educational establishments must be brought into line with the requirements of practical life. The aim of the school must be to give the pupil, beginning with the first sign of intelligence, a grasp of the notion of the State (through the study of civic affairs). We demand the education of gifted children of poor parents, whatever their class or occupation, at the expense of the State.
21. The State must ensure that the nation’s health standards are raised by protecting mothers and infants, by prohibiting child labor, by promoting physical strength through legislation providing for compulsory gymnastics and sports, and by the extensive support of clubs engaged in the physical training of youth.
22. We demand the abolition of the mercenary [i.e. professional] army and the formation of a people’s army.
23. We demand legal warfare on deliberate political mendacity and its dissemination in the press. To facilitate the creation of a German national press we demand:
(a) that all editors of, and contributors to newspapers appearing in the German language must be members of the nation;
(b) that no non-German newspapers may appear without the express permission of the State. They must not be printed in the German language;
(c) that non-Germans shall be prohibited by law from participating financially in or influencing German newspapers, and that the penalty for contravening such a law shall be the suppression of any such newspaper, and the immediate deportation of the non-Germans involved.
The publishing of papers which are not conducive to the national welfare must be forbidden. We demand the legal prosecution of all those tendencies in art and literature which corrupt our national life, and the suppression of cultural events which violate this demand.
24. We demand freedom for all religious denominations in the State, provided they do not threaten its existence nor offend the moral feelings of the German race.
The Party, as such, stands for positive Christianity, but does not commit itself to any particular denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialist spirit within and without us, and is convinced that our nation can achieve permanent health only from within on the basis of the principle: The common interest before self-interest.
25. To put the whole of this program into effect, we demand the creation of a strong central state power for the Reich; the unconditional authority of the political central Parliament over the entire Reich and its organizations; and the formation of Corporations based on estate and occupation for the purpose of carrying out the general legislation passed by the Reich in the various German states.
The leaders of the Party promise to work ruthlessly—if need be to sacrifice their very lives—to translate this program into action.

1i86unn,"CMV: I’m Afraid This Administration Will Make Life Substantially Worse for Black Americans, and I Don’t Know If There’s a Line They Won’t Cross","I’m scared, and I’m looking for reassurance. As a Black person, I’ve already concluded that Trump and Elon Musk are racist, based on their actions and statements. What I’m struggling with is this fear that life under this administration will get substantially worse for people like me—and that their supporters won’t ever draw a line, no matter how bad things get.

Here are some things that have already happened or seem to be in the works:
	
Ending Equal Opportunity Programs: Trump revoked policies aimed at promoting racial equity in hiring and government programs.

Stop-and-Frisk: He signed an executive order encouraging its return, which disproportionately impacts Black and brown communities.
	
Wildfire Risks: Water is being rerouted from Northern California, a region that hasn’t had major wildfires in years, to Central California. This feels like it’s putting lives at risk unnecessarily.
	
Elon Musk’s Nazi Affiliation: Musk has amplified neo-Nazi accounts on Twitter, seemingly supported Germany’s far-right party, and even made what looks like a Nazi salute at a public event.

I’m terrified of what this could escalate to. Discrimination in hiring might push more Black people into desperate situations like selling drugs or stealing to survive. With policies like stop-and-frisk, that could mean more of us ending up incarcerated. My biggest fear is that there’s no “step too far” for their supporters. Would things like migrant camps or even more explicit authoritarian measures finally make people realize this is heading into Nazi territory? Or will they just keep defending every action?

I’m not asking for someone to convince me these people aren’t racist—I’m already past that. I just want to believe that there’s a line they can’t cross, that legal systems, public resistance, or something will stop things from spiraling further.

Can anyone reassure me that there’s hope? Or convince me that this won’t make my life—and the lives of Black Americans—substantially worse?",Scary-Ad-1345,495,0.6000000238418579,1865,1737648586,2025-01-23 10:09:46,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i86unn/cmv_im_afraid_this_administration_will_make_life/,1,2025
1i88qtx,"CMV: Despite being more knowledgeable, wealthier and apparently more tolerant, the political and individual left's biggest flaw is their inability to communicate pragmatically and empathetically with those who don't agree with them.","I've seen this rather confounding phenomenon that despite being ""smarter"" ""wealthier"" ""more tolerant"" and all the general buzz words you hear from the entire left, ranging from mainstream dems to far left people, their inability to humble themselves to actually *help* the other side is the biggest reason they can't succeed. 

Yes, let's rule out the hardest core right wing. But there are too many instances of a hyperventalive, astonished left that absolutely diminishes the pragmatic points they try to make. 

The general example i'm going to reference is the AOCs versus the Bernies. The breathy left versus the ""I have to find solutions"" left. 

I don't understand how anyone with more knowledge than someone cannot communicate with someone who has less knowledge than them. How if *you* know the answer, you can't communicate it with someone patiently enough to come up with common ground.

The problem is the gap in communication. We all get that there are no compromise righties that won't believe a word of what you're saying, but the inability to create mutual understanding is on you. If you can't communicate, then I'm sorry but I don't feel bad for you. There is obviously a lack of respect, and yes, I will forgive some of the interfamily dynamics that can get anyone on edge, but the overall loss of the left is due to their inability to humble themselves to create paradigms that people who oppose them can understand. It is to be on the same page (whether you agree or disagree) that is something worth fighting for, not to simply be astounded that someone thinks ""illegal immigrants are ruining the country,"" ""climate change isn't real"" ""x, y or z."" The *way* you communicate *facts* is what is harming you. 

Trust me when I say that if you are in position of control (are smarter), you should be able to reason with someone you disagree with. Ask any parent if they understand what their kid is saying, yet they can still reason with them and create dialogue. I truly do not believe that someone who is supposed to be smarter, cant find reason. And yes, the reason in this dialogue isnt ""you now agree with me,"" it's the patience to understand that you got them to think that you may be right. 

My true advice to anyone is to work on your communication and reasoning skills then stomping on someone. Learn the advantage of progress versus winning. Achieve common ground with someone you disagree with. 

My advice to your response isn't to simply blame the right. I've given the examples where you can blame them (furthest right, eg., bad actors; family). Let's make the goal to create respect than winning. And we all know that the right has its problems, but just remember, this thread is about you, the left.",poopchow,1013,0.7099999785423279,1398,1737653281,2025-01-23 11:28:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i88qtx/cmv_despite_being_more_knowledgeable_wealthier/,1,2025
1i89lhx,CMV: Pardoning the insurrectionists will prove disastrous for the Republican Party,"I’m open to having my mind changed on this, but I personally fail to see how this plays out well for the GOP. 

I believe this move has short term effects that help Trump’s administration earn some brownie points with MAGA supporters but in the long term I think it might do more harm than good.

I feel like this move solidifies the GOP as a chaotic, anti-law-and-order party, whereas usually they aim to be seen as the opposite. It obviously alienates moderate and independent voters who were disgusted with the events of Jan 6 - as well as younger voters who, as I understand it, are especially critical of the Jan 6 attack on the capitol.

If that isn’t enough, this would solidify Trump’s ties to the Republican party indefinitely, essentially meaning any Republican candidate for the foreseeable future has to play along, embrace the pardon and I could see that playing out badly when they try to appeal to the general electorate when Trump inevitably cannot run again in 2028.

Thoughts? Rebuttals? Looking for some clarity here.

They know and even believe many of the wild things he’s said and done, but don’t care. In fact, that’s a feature of him that they prefer. Calling politicians by names and going “off the cuff” is exactly what they are seeking because it’s how they themselves feel.

So when Democrats or Democratic politicians chastise him for being immoral or corrupt, it doesn’t help their cause at all. The information is already out there and his supporters have already absorbed it. It’s nothing new or alarming for them.

All of this outrage about Trump is a waste of time and effort.

1i9i8mj,"CMV: Without radical change, the Democratic Party will functionally cease to exist before 2040.","This view has one argument behind it: once solid Democratic voting blocs have steadily turned against them. 

From 1980 to 2012, the Latino vote has, with only two exceptions, been over 60% Democrat, usually a victory by 20+ points. Harris won the Latino vote by 5. This isn’t an anomaly either, it’s not Harris being deeply unpopular. It’s a downward trend taking place since 2008. (And probably further back, if you don’t count the outlier of Kerry v. Bush, where Latinos voted conservative at levels roughly equivalent to 2024.)

The same is largely true among black voters. From 95+% during the Obama years, with a steadily decreasing lead since then, black voters seem to be shifting rightward. Even if you consider the Obama years to be an anomaly, which I suppose they are, but not an outlier, the shift is dramatic. Harris won the black vote, despite being black herself, by the smallest margin in the last thirty years at least, and almost certainly more. This is also part of a continuous downward trend. Since Obama, they’ve voted less consistently Democrat than expected. 

If these trends continue, and I think they will, the Democratic Party will functionally cease to exist. They don’t even need to continue far. If they slip a few points more among black voters, that’s *it.*

I haven’t seen anyone talking about this. Sure, people have talked about the Latino vote going more red than expected or Trump making minor gains among black men, but no one seems to have acknowledged that these are *trends* that the Democratic Party will not survive continuing. Is there some glaring flaw in my logic? Or is there a deep panic going on behind closed doors?

I am also left. I am not super politically active, but I know enough about Trump to dislike him.

1i9zyoz,CMV: Trump politics is really about high school social dynamics,"As a Gen X, I remember the distinct social classes in a typical suburban high school where everyone knew their place in the hierarchy.   It was always the good looking kids at the top and didn't matter even if they were dumb as a rock.   It always helped if they were good at sports, excelled at fighting, or could tell funny jokes.  More times than not, the smart kids were on the lower tiers and didn't get invited to many parties.  But one thing you could not be was to be weird.  ""Weird"" meant many things during this stage during this time in our lives.  Being gay definitely qualifies for that label that gave people permission to bully them.  We also didn't understand mental illness, and many kids picked on the weird kids who were obviously struggling to get by.  The lowest of the low were probably the non-English speaking immigrant kids that were virtually invisible.

And then I went off to college and got married and yadi yada.  But the thing that has been shocking in hindsight is how upside down the social heirarchy of the general society in the last 30 to 40 years has been turned upside down from my old high school days.  The relative standing of those people that were deemed so weird back then now seem so much more accepted in society.   Those smart kids went on to become tech CEOs, doctors, lawyers, and engineers.   You may get cancelled or fired if you say the wrong thing about those same weird people now.   Those immigrants kids seem to be doing even better than you.  

Some of those popular kids in high school I knew are now Trump supporters.   They are not as good looking as when they were in high school and they are struggling financially.

1ibbe8c,"CMV: Colonialism was basically inevitable and some other power would eventually do it, if Western Europe didn't","From 16th century onwards, European powers had a really unique combination of opportunity and necessity. They had the means to start colonizing large swaths in the rest of the world and it perfectly fitted the economic needs of the slowly industrializing society. 

What on the other hand wasn't at all uncommon around the world was the desire for conquest and power and complete lack of morals towards achieving these goals. Be it the Qing China, the Mughals or the Ottomans, you would find countless examples of militaristic empires willing to enslave, exploit or genocide anyone standing in the way of their goals. Most African or American empires were maybe less successful, but hardly morally better in this regard.

Even if Europeans somehow decided to not proceed with colonizing the rest of the world, it was only a matter of time until another society undergoing industrialization needs the resources and markets and has the naval power to do exactly what the Europeans did. There was no moral blocks, which would prevent this from happening. 

If the Americas didn't get taken by the Europeans, they would simply face industrialized China or India a few hundred years later. Or maybe it would be the other way around. But in the fragmented world of the past, a  clash would eventually occur and there would probably be a winner.

1icdp5l,CMV: Billionaires shouldn’t exist,"The existence of billionaires is proof of a rigged system that mistakes greed for “innovation” and exploitation for “merit.” It is not a sign of a thriving economy.

No one earns a billion dollars. You *extract* it by underpaying workers, dodging taxes, privatizing public goods,  commodifying basic human needs, etc.

The math doesn't lie. Even spending $1 million a day, it would take almost 3,000 years to go through a billion dollars. The top 1% of Americans hoard $44 trillion in wealth which is more than the bottom 90% combined. Meanwhile ending global poverty would cost roughly $300 billion *annually*. Jeff Bezos could single-handedly fund that for 50 years and still die richer than Croesus. This isn’t capitalism. It’s just feudalism with better PR.  

“But they create jobs!”

No, workers create value and billionaires just skim it. Elon Musk’s wealth surged by $150 billion during the pandemic while his factory employees fought for bathroom breaks and unions. The Walton family’s fortune for example was built on welfare-subsidized Walmart wages so low, taxpayers foot the bill for their employees’ food stamps.  

And philanthropy is a scam. Gates and Zuckerberg don’t “donate” wealth. They stash it in tax-free foundations to lobby governments, dodge accountability, and shape policy in their image. I’m no other toke has this been more true then now with Trump. 

Want to end malaria? Pay. Your. Taxes. Let democratically elected leaders, not unelected oligarchs, decide how to fix society.

I'm also aware that bmi doesn't automatically mean healthy weight and doesn't account for muscle mass so that could skew the results a bit.

1ich3nu,"CMV: Waffles are strictly better than pancakes, and if you have the option to have either, there’s no reason to choose pancakes.","Pancakes are good. Waffles are simply better. Even low grade waffle mix cooked through is crispy on the outside, but fluffy, and spongy on the inside. Pancakes, on the other hand, can turn out rubbery, flavorless, and seemingly cooked on the outside while being raw on the inside. Even when both are properly cooked, waffles have a perfect blend of crispy and fluffy, whereas pancakes are _usually_ either one or the other. Additionally, syrup just slides off pancakes and you end up getting pools of it on your planet, whereas waffles hold and absorb the syrup, giving you glorious pockets of syrup in every bite. All of the benefits of waffles get even better when you make Belgian waffles. They’re so thick, fluffy, crispy, and two of them is a delightful feast. 

To me, this isn’t a vanilla vs chocolate ice cream comparison, because despite generally liking chocolate ice cream more than vanilla, I sometimes want vanilla ice cream.

1ie2m3n,"CMV: Until Melania and Baron Trump are deported, nobody else in the US should be ripped from their homes.","CMV: Nobody in the U.S. should be deported until Melania and Barron Trump are deported, because by Donald Trump's own definition, they are not legal citizens and should be the first to go—along with Elon Musk.

Premise 1: Trump’s Own Immigration Standards  
Donald Trump has consistently advocated for stricter immigration policies, including ending birthright citizenship, revoking visas for those who ""take American jobs,"" and heavily scrutinizing chain migration—the very system through which Melania Trump obtained citizenship. Under his own logic, Melania’s citizenship, obtained via the EB-1 visa (intended for people with ""extraordinary ability""), should be considered invalid, as her qualifications were dubious. If chain migration is unacceptable, then her parents, who became citizens through her, also should not be here. Barron Trump, as the child of an allegedly ineligible citizen, would also lack valid status under this framework.  

Premise 2: Consistency in Deportation Priorities
If the U.S. government enforces deportation policies, it should start with the most high-profile and politically connected individuals who benefited from questionable immigration practices. Trump’s own rhetoric suggests that immigrants take jobs, commit crimes, and exploit loopholes. Elon Musk, a billionaire immigrant, has been accused of labor violations and manipulating the visa system to benefit himself and his businesses. If deportation is about protecting American workers, Musk should be at the top of the list.  

Premise 3: Moral and Logical Fairness  
It is unjust to target vulnerable, low-income immigrants while allowing wealthy or politically powerful immigrants to remain. If Trump’s base truly believes in enforcing immigration laws without exception, they should demand the deportation of those who benefited from the very systems he condemns—starting with his own family. Until this happens, no one else should be deported, as doing so would be an inconsistent and hypocritical application of immigration law.  

Conclusion
If Trump’s immigration policies are to be applied fairly, Melania and Barron Trump, as well as Elon Musk, should be first in line for deportation. Until that happens, the U.S. should halt all other deportations to avoid selective enforcement that disproportionately harms the powerless while protecting the elite.

1ifxdbo,CMV: Most Anti Immigration people are just racist,"I’ve genuinely never seen an anti immigration/ pro deportations person talk about the “issue” of immigration without using racist talking points or bringing up skin color. Whether it be right wing politicians, people in person or people online. I’ve seen politicians call these people “poison” and “vermin” just like how Hitler talked about the jews, and their main focus is Mexicans and South Americans and Africans. Never have I seen them talk about the thousands of Russians, Western Europeans and Canadians that are here illegally. Plus the propaganda about how all immigrants are rapists and gang bangers, which is just factually untrue. There are so many of them here just working to provide for their kids and then there’s a few bad apples in Colorado and they use it to push their agenda that these people are “dangerous criminals”. Miss me with that. 

On top of that, the MAGA party wanting to change “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America”, taking the Spanish option off of their website and ICE detaining people just for speaking Spanish in public seems pretty racist to me. They aren’t going after criminals they’re going after anyone who is brown and speaks Spanish. If they just want to deport the criminals then why are they trying to enter churches and elementary schools??

Trump now wants to start something up in Guantanamo Bay that is more or less a concentration camp. If it’s all about just getting these people out and having them come the “legal way” then why hold them in a camp on in a dangerous place. Also if they’re “pro immigration” as long as it’s legal why is this administration trying to make that process harder??

I’ve never heard a good argument against immigration that isn’t rooted from racism and stereotypes. These people add billions to our social security every year, they pick our vegetables, build our houses, create new jobs and contribute greatly to our economy. Anyone who knows this knows our country won’t be better by getting rid of them, but they’ll just repeat the “they’re all criminals!” And “they’re raping our women!” Until they’re blue in the face with no facts to back it up. Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, how does immigrants being here affect our lives negatively at all?? MAGA just wants them to believe that instead of focusing on the real enemy which is greedy corporations and billionaires.

1ig5g5l,CMV: Trump's focus on politically loyalty over expertise resembles Soviet-Era communist failures.,"Trump, today, is making no mystery of the fact he is firing anyone in government who would enforce a law he ""does not like"" or ""thinks is stupid"" (sorry, 47 admin's wording there). While you hear much about parallels to alt-right fascism, I am actually more reminded of the failures of East Germany and the USSR.

The mentality looks to be driven by two primary engines: the ""unitary executive/committee"" and ""rooting out intellectuals.""

For the unitary executive theory, the USSR and East Germany believed the government existed only to execute the commanding party's agenda. It was acceptable for the executive or executive committee to fire and retaliate against anyone in government who acted against the party's political agenda under this framework, even when the actions that instigated firing or retaliation were driven by legitimate laws there to protect society, the environment, etc. I'd offer that this is exactly the Trump/MAGA attitude today. Regardless if federal law dictates employers hire disabled or racially diverse people when they can, it is acceptable to fire the FAA director for following that long-established federal law, because it does not serve the commanding party's interests.

As for ""quieting"" and ""rooting out"" intellectuals, this again seems to be a Soviet-Era failed posture that Trump/MAGA are adopting full-steam. Real, premiere doctors and researchers look set to be stifled from innovation by a bureaucratic system RFK, Jr., will construct with party loyalists. The same can be said with cybersecurity and defense experts, who will face bureaucratic systems designed to stifle and perhaps even retaliate against real scientists any time they present an idea that is at odds with the MAGA-consensus view. I shudder to think what Trump might have in mind for intellectuals who would risk ""humiliating"" him for failed policies and directives, but at the very least we know he is willing to fire and ridicule them through public posts to social media...

All of this to say, people seem very eager to not repeat the horrors of WW2-era fascism in Germany, and certainly there are reasons to be concerned about that in today's climate. But what I see from Trump and Co. today looks very much more like bureaucracy designed to insulate the unitary executive and stifle intellectuals and their innovation unless it serves the political needs of MAGA.

1ig96ua,"CMV: There will be a US presidential election in 2028, but it will not be free or fair.","As we know, in the final months of the last Trump administration, President Trump, along with many Republican politicians both in Congress and in his administration, tried to overturn the result of the 2020 election. This culminated in the botched coup attempt on January 6th 2021.

Trump did this without the support of the broader government bureaucracy or the military, and nevertheless got surprisingly close to succeeding, or at least to causing the greatest constitutional crisis since the civil war. As I write this, he and his new administration are working to reshape the federal workforce, rooting out, deliberately or not, all those who wouldn't cooperate with a second coup attempt.

Further, while the attempt in 2020/21 was unsuccessful, no one at the top has faced any real consequences, least of all Trump himself. Nothing has happened since 2021 that might convince him that a second coup attempt is not worth it.
  
As a result, I believe that Trump and his administration will try again, one way or another, and that this time there's a good chance they'll succeed. 

To change my view, you'd have to convince me that either:
1) Trump did not try to overturn the 2020 election result, or;
2) he did but has since changed his mind and would leave office peacefully in 2029, or;
3) another coup attempt would most likely fail. 

Clearly, as Trump's re-election shows, there are a huge number of Americans who don't agree with me on this - so what am I missing?


Notes:

I think for clarity I should point out that I'm aware that constitutionally Trump cannot run in 2028. I'm assuming here that the Republican candidate in the next election will be either Trump's anointed successor, be that JD Vance or whoever else, or even Trump himself utilising some kind of loophole.

Similarly, I've deliberately not discussed the exact mechanism(s) by which the 2028 election could be subverted. I think that a sufficiently powerful executive would have several viable options, and that the specifics of each are besides the point. Nevertheless, as stated above, I'm open to being convinced that it simply can't be done.

1igar20,CMV: DEI was a Trojan horse that killed affirmative action and acted as a midwife to MAGA,"DEI was used by corporations to gain social and societal currency. It has always been performative, virtue signaling lacking in intellectual rigor. It has been used as a trojan horse to force ultra leftist identity politics down everyone’s throats, and as a result inadvertently hijacked the black liberation movement. 

Affirmative Action (AA) was born out of the black liberation movement. It had far more teeth and had actual legal backing. DEI stripped it of its power by shifting the focus from enforceable systemic correction to voluntary corporate optics. With affirmative action, failure to act had real consequences. With DEI, failure to act means a company simply updates its branding.

AA mandated hiring goals, quotas, and enforceable accountability measures. DEI, on the other hand is voluntary, self-policed, and lacks any real enforcement mechanism. There’s no requirement to actually hire, retain, or promote diverse talent at scale.

AA was about outcomes, increasing representation through concrete hiring and admissions policies. DEI, in contrast, moved the conversation to “awareness” and “culture”, allowing companies to look progressive while maintaining the same power structures.

AA explicitly targeted **historically oppressed racial groups, acknowledging the need for corrective measures due to centuries of discrimination.** DEI shifted the conversation to include everybody else’s problems.

Since DEI isn’t legally binding, corporations easily and often manipulate it for PR without real investment. Many companies make grand DEI and ESG commitments, but internally have toxic work environments, lay off DEI teams, slow down diversity hiring, and maintain overwhelmingly white leadership. 

It alienated and fueled animus from white men— often making its biggest mistake of openly demonizing white men who were always the primary antagonist for every group. Many DEI initiatives framed white men as the default oppressors while elevating everyone else, often through surface-level representation efforts. Instead of fostering genuine coalition-building, DEI created an “us vs. them” dynamic. This is why I believe it can definitely take some credit for the birth of MAGA. DEI absorbed the language of justice without the obligation to deliver it, effectively neutralizing the radical potential of affirmative action.

DEI became a softer, more palatable alternative to AA. It was designed to placate demands for systemic change while maintaining corporate and institutional power structures. Its blindspot was always white men who were actively ostracized from its objectives.

In the discussions on reddit about abortion, you'll often see pro-choicers demonize pro-lifers for not carving out exemptions  for rape when they are discussing their views. You'll see pro-choicers justify their view by saying that someone shouldn't carry their rapists baby. This is a completely fair view with in the context of bodily autonomy. The problem is that this view doesn't matter in the context of ""all human life has some inherent value"" the way that pro-lifers believe.

The life of someone who was conceived by rape isn't any less valuable than the life of someone who was conceived in some other manner. So for the people who believe that all human life has some inherent value and should be protected, why would it make sense for them to carve out exceptions for rape?

Why wouldn't it be considered morally inconsistent if they make those exceptions?

1iht2i4,CMV: The new DNC Vice Chair David Hogg exemplifies exactly why the Democratic Party lost the 2024 election,"So for those who aren't familiar, one of the Vice Chairs elected by the DNC earlier this week is David Hogg, a 24 year old activist. There's nothing wrong with that aspect, its fine to have young people in leadership positions, however the problem with him is a position he recently took regarding an Alaska Democrat, Mary Peltola. 

Mary Peltola was Alaska's first Democrat Rep in almost 50 years, and she lost this year to Republican Nick Begich. Throughout her 2024 campaign, David Hogg was very critical of her, saying she should support increased gun restrictions, and then he celebrated her loss in November saying again that she should support gun control, in Alaska. This is exactly what's wrong with the DNC.

In 2024, the Democrats lost every swing state, every red state Democratic Senator, and won only three Democratic House seats in Trump districts (all of whom declined to endorse the Harris/Walz ticket). If you look at the Senate map, there is no path to a majority for the Democrats without either almost all of the swing state seats or at least with a red state Democrats. Back in Obama's first term, the Democrats had seats in Montana, Missouri, West Virginia, and both Dakotas, but in 2010 after supporting the ACA and a public option on party lines they lost most of them, and in 2024 after supporting BBB on party lines they lost all of them. 

My view is that the Democrats are knowingly taking a position that its better to lose Democrats in redder areas than to compromise on certain issues, something that has recently been exemplified by the election of a DNC Vice Chair that celebrated the loss of an Alaska Democrat. I think if this strategy continues, they will go decades without retaking the Senate and likely struggle to win enough swing states to take the Presidency again either.

1ij2io3,CMV: Conservative non-participation in science serves as a strong argument against virtually everything they try to argue.,"So many things we are forced to argue these days are talking points that scientific study has already settled. But since there's one side of the aisle that eschews science, we have to work against viewpoints like ""I just know in my mind that such-and-such is true"", which is, needless to say, incredibly frustrating and pointless.

Remember, of course, that even something as simple as collecting historical data and summarizing it counts as a study, and papers are routinely published on those lines. Randomized clinical trials are not the only form of study out there.

Some examples: immigrant crime. So many studies show definitively how immigrants commit FAR fewer thefts, rapes, and murders than native-born citizens, and yet we still have to contend with viewpoints that immigrants are more commonly associated with murder, rape, and theft than the average native-born US citizen. Studies show that gender-affirming therapy very, very rarely causes anyone, *even children*, to regret the therapy they were given, and yet we still have to contend with viewpoints that gender-affirming therapy is likely to screw people up for life. Numerous studies show the effectiveness of all sorts of different types of gun control implementation, and yet we still have to contend with viewpoints that gun control is, across the board, wholly ineffective. 

The most important part of all this, and the part that I hope to discuss the most, is this: if you think the data supports your opinion, *a study would have come out saying so by now*. It mystifies me that people think there are still major stones unturned in the study of everything. Do you realize how hard it is to find a topic of study these days, because of how everything has been studied to death? Why is it that we would all laugh and nod in agreement if I said ""seems like there's a new study coming out every time I breathe"", and this has been true for probably over a century now, and yet you still think maybe we don't have a study analyzing whether gender-affirming treatment actually works? 

It's not even a valid excuse to say that science has a liberal bias...looking at the vote counts of the 2024 US Presidential election, there are at least 75 million conservatives out there. You are really telling me that there was not a single one of those 75 million people who liked science, who had an aptitude for science, who went to school for a scientific field and chose to study some issue that was a big deal to his political persuasion? Not one of the 75 million conservatives did this? Really? *Really?* And if it were a matter of finding a place to publish, are there not numerous conservative research institutes like The Heritage Foundation who would publish your research? Is there otherwise some lack of funding and power amongst conservatives that restricts them from starting journals of their own where they can publish this research? (I hope there's not a single person on the planet who would say yes...)

It's hard to take any angle seriously when it is only argued from a place of internal mental reasoning, rather than from citation of evidence, ESPECIALLY when it is something we should be able to easily settle by looking at the numbers. I rarely, rarely see conservatives do this, and it seriously undermines their credibility. In my experience, they really will answer ""what evidence do you have that X happens?"" with ""common sense"" and they think they've actually scored points in a debate, rather than admitted that they have no proof to back up what they're saying. It's astonishing, really.

Public dueling should be illegal due to risk for an innocent bystander to be hurt, but there should be a system in place where you can schedule a duel. Maybe have them take place in an indoor facility made to withstand a small pistol round, like the material used in indoor firing ranges. Seems to me like it would possibly cut down on innocent bystanders getting hit (like in a gang drive by scenario, if the two rivals are allowed to duel in a protected area that could prevent them from taking action in public).

1ijftfn,CMV:  Canada and other US allies feeling bullied by Trump should start to poach its skilled citizens and businesses.,"Trump has essentially thrown the gloves off and turned the US into an untrusted partner.   This is not something that will just go away as US allies know that the next 4 years at minimum and probably longer will show an unstable US that cannot be trusted to do the right thing going forward.  The reason for this is that the GOP now has full control of all 3 govt branches, SCOTUS has a conservative super majority, and no one is holding him accountable.   Any change that could happen in a 2028 election would be viewed as temporary given the US’ swinging pendulum back to right wing extremism.   

To become more competitive against the US, allies should start to look at how to encourage highly skilled scientists, medical professionals, engineers,  ex-military, businesses, etc to immigrate from the US that have either been targeted by Trump, feel endangered by fascism, or simply disenchanted with being a US citizen going forward.  Industries like green power,  tech, higher ed, medical research etc. that feel they don’t have a future would be prime candidates for targeted incentives and proactive recruitment.   

Creating a program like “Canada Wants You” could be seen as an inclusive way to bring more talent and create growth for their economies.   A master plan would need to be created to prioritize industries to fund incentives and recruitment while also considering location to not overwhelm existing infrastructure.  An example would be a country establishing or maturing a space industry and targeting NASA, SpaceX or Boeing engineers to emigrate to their country. 

 

Counter arguments may be: 

\-Canada or other allies don’t have the money to incentivize large scale immigration:  This would be a fair argument, but investing in the future to become more competitive would be worth taking on debt.

\-Other countries don’t have the same pleasant weather that states like California have:   This would apply to Canada and other countries in northern latitudes, but Spain, France and Italy have decent alternatives for those that simply can’t handle cold. 

\-Individuals may not take the incentive as they have a family: The program would need to take this into consideration that perhaps the immediate family (including adults) would be accommodated as long as they have the means to make money and pay taxes.

\-Trump would retaliate with additional penalties:  No doubt that this would be the case given Trump’s actions lately.   That said, this program would result in a better long-term situation for the country receiving top talent and businesses.   Trump could offer the same thing to the countries by encouraging immigration to the US, but I believe that scientists and skilled professionals seeing what is happening will be turned off by the anti-intellectual behaviors of the US. 

\- Countries can’t handle the additional stress on their infrastructure:  As already noted, a master plan for this program would need to include the infrastructure related improvements to accommodate the additional immigrants.

\- US salaries are much higher than many of the other countries:  This is probably the biggest blocker.    The countries would need to pay for top talent and the country would need to come up with incentives like no taxes for 5 years, bonuses for coming, equity stake etc.  This could also lead to some animosity by the country’s citizens, but like a franchise player getting paid megabucks, it should be worth it if it drives innovation and competitiveness.

1ijh6od,CMV: Trumps true agenda is to create outrage and confusion so people are distracted and scattered and the left is falling right into the trap,"Panama, Mexico, Canada, Gaze, Greenland, China. Every single day of every single hour, Trump and his admins are saying crazy shit that they have no intention of doing or no ability to do, in an effort to pass their true agenda which is siphoning off wealth from the United States. 

[Ezra Klein explains it perfectly ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8QLgLfqh6s)here talking about Steve Bannon: ***""The opposition party is the media, and  because they're dumb and they're lazy they can only focus on one thing at a time all we have to do is flood the Zone. Every day we hit them with three things they'll bite on one and we'll get all of our stuff done bang bang bang these guys will never will never be able to recover""***



This is exactly what is happening. We are falling for it. The airtime that a lot of his verbal garbage has gotten in the past two weeks is a smokescreen for what is going on behind the scenes. 

  
People are falling into the trap of letting themselves be distracted (including myself). There cannot be any organized movements or coordinated efforts of masses of people listening to federal employees and appointed officials because everyone is spread thin between outrage and fighting about Gaza, Trump Coin, Greenland, Tariffs, Nata, Ukraine. There is no singular point to focus on.

  
Trump knows that a lot of what he says will not get passed, but it does not matter. Because the lying, deceit and corruption is so normalized. 



I just don't see how these past two weeks have been anything other than the democrats/non-maga people being anything other than helplessly playing into his hand. At every point he wins. Even when he looses he wins because nobody cares. He controls the spin. As far as he and his supporters are concerned he wins every single encounter. 

Trump is using the tinkerbell effect to certify himself as the winner. He won the tariffs because he has the largest microphone and everyone who is glued to watch his daily outrage are falling into his web. His ratings, his ""bad publicity is better than no publicity"". The mass confusion. 



Am I wrong? I feel that Project 2025 and Steve Bannon laid out that plan years ago. Like Brave New World, the true dystopian nightmare is that the truth is not some hidden conspiracy.

But I’ve noticed a pattern where some of the same people who fight against censorship are fine with suppressing speech when it suits their agenda.

Many conservatives praised Elon Musk for taking over Twitter, saying he would restore free speech. But under his leadership, Twitter has banned journalists who criticized him, suspended accounts tracking his private jet, and suppressed posts from political opponents.

If it was wrong for Twitter to censor conservatives before, why is it okay now?

Some conservatives argue that businesses should be free from government interference. But in states like Tennessee and Florida, they’ve pushed for laws restricting drag performances and LGBT content, even in private businesses.

If conservatives oppose government control over businesses, why support laws dictating what people can perform or express?

Conservatives often defend companies rights when it comes to political donations or free market decisions. But when companies take stances they don’t like, such as Disney opposing Florida ""Don’t Say Gay"" bill, suddenly they advocate for government retaliation.

1imbzi7,CMV: Trump Will Mark the Beginning of the End of the U.S. as a Global Superpower,"For the past 80 years, the United States has been *the* dominant Western superpower—militarily, economically, technologically, and culturally. However, Trump's presidency, particularly his second term, has made it clear to the rest of the world that the U.S. can no longer be relied upon as a stable military ally or a self-regulating democracy with effective checks and balances.

For decades, much of the Western world has relied on the security and global leadership of the U.S., particularly through NATO. But now, many of us are waking up to the reality that this reliance is no longer viable. Regardless of the fact that a significant portion of Americans oppose Trump and everything he represents, the fact remains: the country elected him—*twice*. This suggests one of three possibilities:

1. A deliberate and conscious choice by the public to embrace Trump’s leadership.
2. The result of institutions so weakened, corrupt, or manipulated that public ignorance was effectively engineered—potentially by external forces that stand to benefit (it would certainly align with known Russian geopolitical strategy).
3. A mix of both—some voters knowingly supporting him while others were misled by systemic dysfunction.

I say this as someone from Spain, where, like many other European nations, we have neglected our own capacity for self-defense, relying instead on NATO and the security provided by an allied nation that spends more on its military than the rest of the world combined in any given year. But Trump's America has demonstrated that this reliance is no longer sustainable.

In just three weeks (!) since his second inauguration, Trump and his administration have already threatened military action in **Panama, Gaza, Greenland**, and have come dangerously close to doing the same with **Canada**—one of the closest and strongest alliances in the world. Instead of military threats, he has chosen economic coercion to undermine Canada’s sovereignty.

People are not stupid. You can call these tactics “negotiation strategies,” “distractions,” or whatever justification you want—but that doesn’t change the long-term consequences. Whether intentional or not, Trump’s actions have made it clear that NATO, Europe, and the broader Western world can no longer depend on the United States as the so-called “world police” (a sentiment that has existed since Vietnam and solidified with Iraq).

European leaders are already acknowledging this, openly discussing the need for greater military and economic independence. And while Europe has its own issues—particularly the resurgence of far-right populism—Trump’s second term offers a *real-time case study* in how democratic institutions can be undermined from within. This might, hopefully, give European governments enough time to reinforce their own institutions before a similar phenomenon takes root here.

Beyond geopolitics, Trump’s America is also self-sabotaging its academic and technological leadership. The U.S. has long attracted the brightest minds in science, technology, and research, but under Trump, those systems are being crippled. If you are a top researcher, why would you choose to work in a country where:

* Salaries might be higher, but the quality of life is worse?
* You have unrestricted access to guns but limited reproductive rights?
* Free speech is celebrated on social media but censored in academic research?

This will inevitably lead to *brain drain*, further accelerating the decline of U.S. leadership in innovation, science, and education.

Yes, in the short term, Trump’s aggressive trade policies might secure *favorable* economic deals, but they come at the cost of severely damaging U.S. alliances and international trust—possibly beyond repair. It does not matter if Trump comes out tomorrow, apologizing for everything, and saying he is sorry (lol). Why would any country *trust* the U.S. again in the next 20 years?

They conveniently forget that alimony literally exists because women historically weren’t allowed to work, and even today, women still often sacrifices their career to be a full time homemaker, she loses years (or even decades) of work experience, skill development, and retirement savings. If the marriage ends, she’s at a serious financial disadvantage compared to her husband, who continued earning, advancing in his career, and securing his financial future.

The very tired rebuttal I always get from my fellow is essentially “women initiate most divorces, so they shouldn’t get anything.” If a woman spends 20 years raising kids, maintaining the home, and supporting her husband’s career, only to file for divorce (and you believe she should walk away with nothing just because she initiated the divorce) then you never truly supported the trad wives to begin with. You supported a system where she financially depends on her husband, but the moment she decides to leave, you think that dependence should be punished.

1iqpkgw,"CMV: The increasingly vague usage of ""DEI"" as a term is to help enforce segregationist policy or silence/invisibility","Terminology is a powerful thing, when we stop using words'meanings we can start to divorce and lose the concepts. Diversity, equity inclusion, and accessibility are very generalized terms for potentially dozens to hundreds of different forms of programming and initiatives. Increasingly it has been used as a dog whistle term much like affirmative action to be a stand in for the Boogeyman of racial quotas. However that fails to really address the increasingly broad application of the concept by those seeking to destroy it. This broad application of the term appears to be used to essentially mean: Any acknowledgement of non-white, non-cis, non-able bodies, judeo-christian men is considered an extension of DEI.

Recently plaques were covered that the  Cryptology Museum in Maryland and women in STEM have found articles about their work or even mentioning their being highlighted have evaporated. How does acknowledging the hard work overcoming historical obstacles do harm? How does it detract from society and how does hiding them improve the federal government or save money? Rumors are surfacing that National Park Services staff are not only facing firing but are being asked to scrub local history, especially as it related to ""DEI"". As many may know cancer and other medical research *needs* a focus on gender, race, etc. (Data  doesn't care about whether the  population fits our ideals, data is data and not having that data is a problem for real people of all kinds). It simply appears that acknowledging unique history or the struggles of a group are being seen as innately un-American which was a common Civil Rights refrain. MLK, SNCC, was seen as just as un-American as the Black Panther Party or even their white allied organizations. To speak on Rosa Parks or to just state facts about the Stonewall Riot is framed as unnecessary in the context of anti-DEI and removed from historical and state documentation.

What furthers my belief is the release of DOGE's plan to essentially move from eliminating programs to an undefined description of firing any employee tied to DEI activity...without ever defining it oreven limiting it to ""Within their official role as a federal employee"". Based on that idea, going to a PRIDE parade, being a member of the NAACP, or potentially having been in a student union in college could be reason to let someone go. What's to stop a group of DSS workers from being fired for making their own little work group to trade tips for managing ADHD? What would stop an investigation from happening because a senior engineer decided to take three autistic new hires to lunch because that engineer also is autistic and just is happy to spend time with similar peers? Would an HBCU graduate speaking at an HBCU graduation be a problem? Increasingly the answer is all of these situations are suspicious and harmful because the definition is intentionally broad

 Quite frankly, there's no definition of ""DEI"" which is much scarier than affirmative action because it could be applied in incredibly sweeping generalizations.

If this anti Diversity and accessibility crusade was about unfairly focusing on historically marginalized groups harming people with more historical access to baseline opportunities etc. Why would we need to erase any mention of the past acknowledgememts or stop anything regarding research in the medical field? If this is about stopping unfairness then why isn't DEI more narrowly defined and why would they go after individuals generally involved in any ""DEI programming?

It is not logical to believe it is harming a white man to also study why prostate cancer is having X affect more often on Asian men. There is no tangible benefit to anyone in that example and perhaps general risk to both groups due to not identifying or isolating unique information that may further our general understandings.

In reality, trade deficits can be a sign of economic strength, and Trump’s misunderstanding of this basic concept has led to misguided trade policies that hurt both American businesses and consumers.

The U.S. trade deficit means Americans buy more goods from other countries than they sell abroad. But that doesn’t mean money is just disappearing. Foreign countries use their U.S. dollars to invest back into the American economy, whether through purchasing U.S. stocks, bonds, or real estate. The U.S. benefits from a trade deficit because it gets cheap imports, which lower costs for consumers and businesses.

**2. The U.S. Trade Deficit is Largely a Result of American Economic Strength**

The U.S. has a massive trade deficit in goods, but a surplus in services (like finance and technology). Americans have more disposable income than many other countries, so they buy more imports—that’s a sign of consumer power, not weakness. A strong U.S. dollar makes imports cheaper, which naturally contributes to the trade deficit.

**3. Trump’s Tariffs Backfired and Proves he Doesn’t Understand Trade**

Trump’s tariffs on China didn’t reduce the trade deficit—they actually made goods more expensive for Americans. Instead of fixing the deficit, Trump’s policies led to retaliatory tariffs, which hurt American farmers and manufacturers. The damage was so severe that Trump had to approve a $28 billion bailout for farmers during his first term to offset their losses. If his trade policies were actually working, why did U.S. farmers need a government bailout? The trade deficit with China remained high because businesses just shifted supply chains to other countries like Vietnam and Mexico. The U.S. International Trade Commission reported in 2021 that tariffs raised prices between 1.7% and 7.1% in the ten most affected sectors, including apparel, car parts, furniture, and computer equipment. These findings are one of the many studies that indicate tariffs often result in increased costs for consumers, as importers and retailers adjust prices to offset the additional expenses.

**4. If Canada Stopped Exporting Oil, It Would Run a Trade Deficit With the U.S.**

Trump loves to complain about the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, but he ignores that it’s largely because Canada exports massive amounts of oil and raw materials to the U.S. If Canada stopped exporting oil, it would run a trade deficit with the U.S. because it imports more U.S. manufactured goods than it sells back in other sectors. Said raw materials and crude oil are then refined and manufactured into higher-value products by American companies, who sell them for a profit. This means the U.S. isn’t just “losing” money to Canada—it’s leveraging Canada’s exports to fuel its own industries. Trade deficits don’t mean one country is “winning” and another is “losing”—they’re just a reflection of what different economies specialize in.

Trump sees trade as a zero-sum game where the U.S. “loses” if it imports more than it exports. However, that’s not how trade works. Trade deficits can actually be beneficial, and Trump’s ignorance on this issue has led to harmful policies that hurt American workers, businesses, and consumers.",ChazzioTV,1201,0.8700000047683716,232,1739748544,2025-02-16 17:29:04,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ir5tyk/cmv_trump_misunderstands_trade_deficits_and_its/,2,2025

1isdzij,CMV: r/Conservative posts are getting pushed to the front page with little engagement,"Posted this in r/nostupidquestions originally, but it was removed for being a rant, so hopefully I can get an answer here. So, like some others have also noted, I’ve been getting more posts from the conservative subreddit pushed to my popular page, and I noticed that there’s a big discrepancy between the upvotes on the post itself versus the top level comments.

Here's what I mean:

Political and current event posts usually get a LOT of engagement, a post that has ~4000 upvotes usually has a top comment with upvotes between 800 to 2400, but the r/conservative posts that are getting around 4k votes have top comments around 200. 

Why such a huge difference? Are people really scrolling through Reddit, upvoting the post but not reading or voting on any of the comments?

On top of that, the comments are weird too. I know it’s a heavily moderated subreddit, but the comment count versus the amount of comments you can actually see is an order of magnitude in difference, and when you click on the collapsed replies most of them have nothing there. Don’t removed comments show as deleted?

I realize that I might just be ignorant of how Reddit works, and I’m not trying to make this a political post. I’m genuinely looking for an answer here, and thanks in advance.

Some examples from the last couple days:

**""Being more progressive would've energized her base"".** No. It would not have energized her base, it would have energized *you*. Progressives are not, and never have been, the base of the Democratic Party. Progressivism is something that was introduced to us 10 years ago by someone who wasn't even a democrat (Bernie), and both times (2016 & 2020) the voters said ***no***, decisively. (No, the 2016/2020 primaries were not ""rigged"", but I can debate that in the comments)  
  
In 2016 & 2020, Harris watched her, as well as other progressives (Bernie & Warren), get demolished in the primaries by more moderate figures. Now with that in mind, why would she try that strategy again? It's pretty simple lol. And even when Kamala proposed mildly progressive ideas ( eg child tax credit), she got hit with the ""why didn't you do this in the past 4 years""?

Nobody cares about paying +10% taxes for socialism when they can't even afford groceries.. Read the room.. The 2024 election was not the time or place for that. You can't expect her to become a clone of Bernie Sanders so she can pander to you...

Russia has been trying to paint Ukraine’s government as illegitimate since day one to justify their invasion. Now Trump is repeating that same narrative, right when U.S. support for Ukraine is on shaky ground.

This isn’t just a one-off. There’s a pattern here:

He Keeps Echoing Russian Talking Points! Whether it’s doubting Ukraine’s legitimacy, suggesting NATO is useless, or taking Putin’s word over U.S. intelligence, he has a history of saying things that conveniently benefit Russia.

He’s undermining ukraine right when it needs support most! By calling Zelenskyy a dictator, he’s fueling skepticism about military aid, which plays right into Putin’s hands.

It’s not just Words, it’s actions too! Let’s not forget that Trump literally withheld aid from Ukraine in 2019, leading to his first impeachment. Even now, he’s openly saying he’d let Russia do “whatever the hell they want” if NATO countries don’t pay up.",No_Discussion6913,1103,0.8700000047683716,498,1740053714,2025-02-20 06:15:14,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1itx4hk/cmv_trump_recent_comments_on_ukraine_prove_hes/,2,2025
1itzpg1,"CMV: The US is firmly now an unpredictable adversery, not an ally to the Western world & should be treated as such.","And we should have been preparing to do it since the previous Trump presidency. 

But with his labelling of Ukraine as a dictatorship yesterday & objection to calling Russia an aggressor in today's G7 statement today Pax Americana is firmly dead if it wasn't already. And in this uncertain world, we in Europe need to step up not only to defend Ukraine but we need to forge closer links on defence & security as NATO is effectively dead. In short, Europe needs a new mutual defence pact excluding the US.

We also need to  re-arm without buying US weaponry by rapidly developing supply chains that exclude the USA. Even if the US has the best technology, we shouldn't be buying from them; they are no longer out allies & we cannot trust what we're sold is truly independent. This includes, for example, replacing the UK nuclear deterrent with a truly independent self-developed one in the longer term (just as France already has), but may mean replacing trident with French bought weapons in the shorter term. Trident is already being replaced, so it's a good a time as any to pivot away from the US & redesign the new subs due in the 2030s. But more generally developing the European arms industry & supply chains so we're not reliant on the US & to ensure it doesn't get any European defence spending.

Further, the US is also a clear intelligence risk; it needs to be cut out from 5 eyes & other such intelligence sharing programmes. We don't know where information shared will end up. CANZUK is a good building block to substitute, along with closer European intelligence programmes.

Along with military independence, we should start treating US companies with the same suspicion that we treat Chinese companies with & make it a hostile environment for them here with regards to things like government contracts. And we should bar any full sale or mergers of stratigicly important companies to investors from the US (or indeed China & suchlike). 

Financially, we should allow our banks to start ignoring FACTA & start non-compliance with any US enforcement attempts.

The list of sectors & actions could go on & on, through manufacturing, media & medicine it's time to treat the US as hostile competitors in every way and no longer as friendly collaborators.

To be clear, I'm not advocating for sanctions against the US, but to no longer accommodate US interests just due to US soft power & promises they have our back, as they've proven that they don't.

The opposition party needs to be rising to the level of intensity in this moment. Sit ins on the house floor, getting arrested if need be. They need to be running ads and other paid media now like if they were running a campaign. They need to be a real political party.

1iw2evt,"CMV: If the United States Wants to Raise Funds, It Should Start by Taxing Religious Organizations, Namely Churches","The U.S. has a massive national debt and frequently debates how to raise revenue—whether by increasing taxes on individuals, businesses, or the wealthy. But one major source of untapped funds is religious organizations, particularly churches, which collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and generate billions in untaxed revenue each year.

Religious institutions currently benefit from 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, meaning they pay no federal income tax, property tax, or investment tax, and members can deduct donations to them. This is justified under the principle of separation of church and state, but I’d argue that exemption is outdated and unfair for several reasons:

1. Churches function like businesses. Many run multi-million-dollar enterprises, own vast real estate holdings, and operate profitable ventures (e.g., book sales, TV networks, investments). Yet, they are taxed less than the average small business. Why should a megachurch be tax-free while a struggling coffee shop pays full taxes?
2. Some churches engage in political activity. Under IRS rules, tax-exempt organizations must refrain from endorsing candidates, yet some churches routinely influence elections and policy. If they want to play politics, they should pay taxes like PACs do.
3. Fraud and lack of financial oversight. Unlike other nonprofits, churches do not have to disclose financial statements. This lack of transparency enables fraud, mismanagement, and wealth hoarding under the guise of religious exemption. Examples include televangelists living in mansions and pastors flying private jets.
4. Taxing churches would be a fairer way to raise revenue. Instead of increasing taxes on middle-class Americans or small businesses, taxing religious organizations could generate tens of billions annually, easing the burden on everyone else.

To be clear, I am not advocating taxing individual donations to religious causes, nor am I saying all churches are corrupt. But if a religious organization accumulates significant assets, engages in business-like activities, or influences politics, it should pay its fair share like any other entity.

1iwnuxk,CMV: MAGA is a scam that exploits the working class,"The “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) movement was never about making America great. It was never about empowering working-class Americans or restoring economic prosperity for those left behind by globalization, automation, and corporate greed. Instead, it has always been a scam—a carefully engineered distraction to stoke resentment, sow division, and keep ordinary Americans too angry at the wrong enemies to recognize they are being systematically exploited.

Donald Trump and his billionaire backers built MAGA on the promise of fighting for the “forgotten Americans”—the blue-collar workers who saw their jobs disappear, the rural communities left hollowed out, and the families watching their wages stagnate while their cost of living skyrocketed. He made them believe their suffering wasn’t caused by corporate greed or billionaire tax cuts, but by immigrants, minorities, liberals, and a so-called “deep state” working against them.

It was all a con.

MAGA isn’t a movement for working-class Americans—it’s a branded identity, complete with red hats and rally chants, designed to make its followers feel like they’re part of something bigger while ensuring they never realize they are being exploited. Instead of helping struggling Americans, MAGA’s real function is to distract, divide, and exploit.

Step One: Exploiting Economic Anxiety with False Promises

From the start, Trump positioned himself as a champion of the working class, promising to bring back manufacturing jobs, stop outsourcing, and put American workers first. But every single economic policy enacted under MAGA did the opposite.
- The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Trump’s signature policy, overwhelmingly benefited the top 1%, giving billionaires and corporations massive tax breaks while offering crumbs to working-class Americans.
- Corporations used their tax breaks for stock buybacks, not job creation, further enriching CEOs and investors while leaving workers with stagnant wages.
- Factories continued closing, and automation expanded, eliminating more jobs—a reality Trump never addressed.

Meanwhile, MAGA supporters pay a higher tax rate than many billionaires. While everyday Americans see a chunk of their paychecks disappear to taxes, billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and even Trump himself exploit loopholes, offshore accounts, and special tax breaks to pay far less than the average worker.
- A firefighter or teacher might pay 22-24% in taxes, while billionaires often pay an effective tax rate of less than 10%—sometimes even zero.
- A 2021 report revealed that some of America’s richest people paid zero federal income tax in multiple years, while MAGA supporters were left covering the cost.

The working class is paying for the billionaire class to get richer—yet MAGA convinces them their enemy is a poor immigrant or a liberal college student instead.

Step Two: Manufacturing an Enemy to Hide Who’s Really Screwing You Over

The genius of MAGA isn’t just in its false promises—it’s in its ability to make its supporters blame everyone except the actual people exploiting them. Every time Trump or his allies betrayed the working class, they fed their base a new villain:
- Immigrants are taking your jobs! (Reality: Corporations are outsourcing jobs and automating labor to increase profits.)
- Minorities are getting all the government benefits! (Reality: The biggest beneficiaries of government subsidies and tax breaks are billionaires and corporations.)
- Liberals want to destroy America! (Reality: Billionaires on both sides profit from division while ordinary Americans struggle with rising costs and stagnant wages.)

Instead of uniting Americans against the people who actually rigged the system—corporate elites, Wall Street, and political insiders—MAGA encourages its base to fight a cultural war against their fellow citizens. If you can convince a struggling factory worker in Ohio that their real enemy is an undocumented immigrant in Texas or a lesbian barista in Brooklyn, they’ll never stop to question why their boss just got a massive tax cut while their wages stayed the same.

Step Three: Suppressing the Vote to Maintain Control

MAGA leaders know that if more people vote, their hold on power is at risk. So instead of winning elections through popular support, they focus on voter suppression tactics designed to keep working-class Americans, particularly minorities and young people, from voting.
- Closing polling places in minority neighborhoods makes it harder for Black and Latino voters—who tend to vote Democratic—to cast their ballots.
- Strict voter ID laws disproportionately affect lower-income Americans who may not have driver’s licenses or easy access to government offices to obtain IDs.
- Purging voter rolls under the guise of “election integrity” often removes eligible voters, forcing them to jump through bureaucratic hurdles to re-register.
- Gerrymandering districts to dilute the power of working-class and minority voters ensures that even when MAGA policies hurt the people they claim to help, the system is rigged to keep them in office.

Trump and his allies spread lies about voter fraud not because fraud is a real issue—it isn’t—but because they need an excuse to justify voter suppression tactics that keep power in the hands of the wealthy. If everyone who was eligible to vote actually did, MAGA would collapse overnight.

Step Four: Keeping Americans Distracted with Endless Culture Wars

MAGA is not about policy—it’s about emotion. It thrives on outrage and grievance because if Americans ever stopped fighting each other long enough to look at the policies being enacted, they’d realize they were being conned. That’s why Trump and his allies keep their base hooked on an endless cycle of manufactured outrage.
- Instead of addressing rising healthcare costs, MAGA tells its followers to be mad about trans people in bathrooms.
- Instead of tackling corporate monopolies and stagnant wages, MAGA wants its base obsessed with whether someone knelt during the national anthem.
- Instead of fixing America’s broken education and job training programs, MAGA convinces its base that the real crisis is “woke” teachers indoctrinating their children.

This is not accidental. The more energy MAGA voters spend fighting these battles, the less likely they are to recognize the real scam happening right in front of them.

Step Five: Keeping the Working Class Down and Powerless

The final piece of the puzzle is ensuring that working-class Americans stay frustrated, poorly educated, and economically insecure—because an empowered, informed working class would be a threat to billionaire rule.
- MAGA Republicans push massive cuts to education funding because an educated population is harder to manipulate with lies and propaganda.
- They work to gut workers’ rights and labor protections because if people had strong unions and higher wages, they wouldn’t be as desperate or easily controlled.
- They fight against universal healthcare because nothing keeps people more dependent on their jobs (and less willing to fight back) than the fear of losing health insurance.

The system isn’t broken—it’s working exactly as intended. Billionaires don’t want independent, secure, well-educated Americans. They want a desperate, divided, easily misled population that will keep voting for the very people exploiting them.

The Hard Truth: MAGA Is a Scam—But Its Victims Keep Defending It

The tragedy of MAGA is that its biggest victims are the ones defending it most fiercely. Millions of working-class Americans, manipulated by fear and resentment, have been tricked into fighting for billionaires who are actively making their lives worse. They cheer for tax cuts they’ll never see, fight for industries that will never return, and defend a system that ensures they remain trapped in a cycle of economic frustration.

And when the next election comes, they’ll be told once again that their real enemies aren’t the billionaires hoarding wealth, the corporations sending jobs overseas, or the politicians voting against their interests. Instead, they’ll be told to blame immigrants, minorities, LGBTQ+ people, college students, and “coastal elites.” And once again, the cycle will repeat—because as long as MAGA keeps Americans angry at each other, they’ll never turn their anger toward the people actually responsible.

MAGA isn’t about making America great again. It’s about making sure the rich stay rich, the powerful stay in control, and the working class stays too divided and misled to do anything about it.

Often times people will just say that 5 lives are more valuable than 1 life and thus the only morally correct thing to do is pull the lever.

I understand the problem is hypothetical and we have to choose the objectivelly right thing to do in a very specific situation. However, the question is formed in a way that makes the murders a statistic thus pushing you into a utilitarian answer. Its easy to disassociate in that case. The same question can be manipulated in a million different ways while still maintaining the 5 to 1 or even 5 to 4 ratio and yield different answers because you framed it differently.

Flip it completely and ask someone would they spend years tracking down 3 innocent people and kill them in cold blood because a politician they hate promised to kill 5 random people if they dont. In this case 3 is still less than 5 and thus using the same logic you should do it to minimize the pain and suffering.

1iy3g36,"CMV: Russia should be held accountable for invading Ukraine, and they shouldn’t be allowed to veto their own punishment","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a clear violation of international law and sovereignty. The fact that Russia, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, can veto any resolution aimed at holding them accountable is deeply troubling. It’s like allowing a criminal to veto their own punishment—how can we expect justice when the perpetrator has that kind of power?

The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Russia’s actions (93 to 18), but the Security Council’s structure gives Russia the ability to block any real consequences. This is not just a flaw in the system; it’s a serious issue that allows a nation to act out wildly, without facing the repercussions of their aggression.

If Russia is allowed to continue this unchecked, it sets a dangerous precedent where powerful countries can invade others and avoid consequences simply because they have the power to block action. That’s not how international law should work. If we believe in sovereignty and accountability, we need to reform the U.N. and prevent Russia from using its veto to avoid facing the consequences of its actions.

How to change my view: 
If presented with evidence that Russia was not in the wrong in invading Ukraine, and that somehow it was Ukraine’s fault, I would be open to reconsidering my position. Also, if you can explain to me how having five permanent powers in the U.N. is more fair, especially when those countries are acting in bad faith, and how it’s justifiable for them to have a veto on being held accountable for their actions, that would also help change my perspective.",PoolShotTom,1238,0.9399999976158142,222,1740511643,2025-02-25 13:27:23,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1iy3g36/cmv_russia_should_be_held_accountable_for/,2,2025
1iy695u,"CMV: White men and Christians are NOT being “attacked” or “persecuted”. They are just experiencing public backlash and being held accountable for the first time, and now, they are playing victim.","I keep seeing this rhetoric about how Christianity and the white male is under attack in America. I believe that these populations are just finally experiencing backlash , made possible with things like the internet and free speech. 

Take the “make loneliness epidemic” for example. Young men have began blaming everyone but themselves for not being able to find a girlfriend. With women becoming more independent over the past several decades and moving away from the trad wife role, they’re now able to be a little more picky . Theyre also making more money on their own. There’s no reason to settle for someone who isn’t right for them in the long term, whereas in the past, women felt much more obligated to men  because of the dependence dynamic. 

Because the trad wife / male provider idea has been around for a while, young men are still being raised to believe women need them, that women must be homemakers, and they feel entitled to a wife. Men never had to try very hard in the past too find a wife because , like i said, women were not in a position where they could be picky. Now, women are getting educated and working , and men are falling behind because they never saw value in that, and just assumed they would magically get a wife someday. There are so many men nowadays who expect a trad wife , but without themselves playing the role of the provider. They get pissed whenever women don’t like them , all because women have much higher standards and expect to be treated with the same amount of respect as anyone else. Men don’t realize they are not entitled to a wife, and there’s no reason for any woman to be with them if they don’t want to be. So now They just start blaming women for “asking for too much” , they blame the government for everything being expensive and not being able to make more money than their woman counterparts, they blame “woke” for everyone becoming “too sensitive and entitled”, etc. They blame everyone but themselves for the situation they’re in, they take no accountability, and now they’re playing victim. 

It’s similar with Christianity. Christianity was always , *AND STILL IS*, the majority religion in the USA. However, with the country evolving and being more accepting of lifestyles outside of the traditional Christian life, and with the internet giving more voice to people to express their disdain for the religion, they now think they’re under attack. All that’s really happening is that people are freely voicing their opinions about the religion , and how they feel the religion has been harmful to their existence in some way. There have been no laws or regulations passed that outlaw or hinder the practice of Christianity in any way, in fact, white Christian men are currently running the country. 

They just feel that the very existence of anything outside their view of traditional family values is an attack. Being allowed to fly a pride flag at a school is not attacking Christianity. Trans people simply existing in public spaces is not an attack on Christianity. Gay marriage is not an attack on Christianity. if the person certifying the marriage is a Christian, and is obligated by law to certify that marriage, that is not an attack on Christianity. Allowing other ideals and belief systems to exist in the same space as Christianity is not an attack on Christianity. If a gay man gets online and expresses his disdain for the religion , because his Christian family disowned him, that is not an attack on Christianity. That is someone voicing their opinion, which they are allowed to do, and that is someone who is having an emotional response to being harmed in the name of Christianity. Not everyone has to agree with or follow your religion. If you can’t take it, don’t dish it out. As long as an entirely Christian government can be elected into office by will of the people, the religion is not being persecuted. There is no reason to play victim. 

TLDR; White Christian men have finally been held accountable for all the oppression and harm they’ve inflicted onto everything they touch. Now, the world is figuring out we don’t need to depend on men or Christianity to survive, and they now must actually earn the respect of people. However, they still have the same sense of entitlement they had before, they aren’t trying at all to catch up with society and other part, and are now playing victim all because no one views them as superior anymore— hint, they never were superior. The “male loneliness epidemic” proves this , with white men feeling entitled to the respect of women,  and the Christian “traditional family values”.

1. Drug lords who can throw money to establish operational bases here. Think the NY fentanyl bureau chief is a Gold visa holder.

2. Some really corrupt people in third world countries who have obtained their wealth illegally. Most probably being investigated or wanted in their own country

3. Terrorist and criminals funded by shadow groups from other parts of the world

4. Countries planting their spies

 The US police force and their image will always be at odds with their citizens as long as they regularly use stealth/unmarked cars. Every encounter turns into a sneaky gotcha moment and are what keeps people distrustful. Extends to their uniforms too. Most wear some form of black or blue as it helps them blend in. There's no reason unless your mentality is to surprise.

There's a time and place for unmarked cars. That time and place is when you have a perp or bust you know about in advance. Not a random encounter with a citizen.

1izqtzv,CMV: The Economic Blackout Boycott will fail entirely.,"I believe the Economic Blackout Boycott on February 28th will fail entirely because the threat of no sales for a day is effectively null.

Let’s say the movement includes 100% of all adults in the US (It most certainly will not). Even if they all stop buying most large scale companies will have customers outside of the US. And for there to be any effect on companies it would need to at least last several months. They’re threatening literally nothing. Most people don’t even buy things every day so many won’t even do anything different.

Even if they decided to make it last 4 months most people can’t do that. You’ll find that every product you buy somewhere in the chain will have a mass produced item from a huge company. And most items can’t be made at home. This won’t be like the colonial times where people could make the goods at home with some decreased quality. You cannot simply make gasoline at home or build a computer chip entirely from scratch. 

Plus this only affects individual consumers not any of the companies that receive stock from them. And what about those little businesses you care about so much that receive some of their product from the large corporations. 

Once the boycotts over people will go back to buying what they would’ve bought yesterday. And if they were to continue the boycott for months then what happens when companies start to fire employees. People are now losing jobs because of your silly little boycott. You’re harming the people too. Obviously this won’t happen cause people aren’t gonna boycott literally everything except the Amish run companies who run entirely separate from the rest of society. 

If you want to make a change then you need to target specific companies that you can live without, are entirely based in the US, and boycott them for months to years. 

This entire “boycott” is barely even a boycott. Your not exercising your power over the mega corporations your showing your reliance on them and unwillingness to go without the essentials for more than a day.

1j0yfzf,CMV: “America First” Somehow Keeps Putting Russia First,"
Trump sat across from Zelenskyy, an ally whose country is literally being invaded, and instead of backing him… he mocked him. Called him “disrespectful.” Accused him of “gambling with World War III.” Then he stormed out and killed a minerals deal that would’ve benefited the U.S. because, apparently, humiliating Ukraine was the bigger priority.

And who benefits? Russia. Again.

I hear the arguments… some of you think Zelenskyy is dragging this war out instead of negotiating. Or that he’s too reliant on U.S. aid and isn’t “grateful enough.” Maybe you think Ukraine is corrupt, that this is just another endless war, or that backing them will drag us into something worse.

But let’s be honest, what’s the alternative? Let Russia take what they want and hope they stop there? Hand them pieces of Ukraine and pretend it won’t encourage them to push further? That’s not peace, that’s appeasement. And history has shown exactly how well that works.

As for the money… yes, supporting Ukraine costs us. But what’s the price of letting authoritarian regimes redraw borders by force? What happens when China takes the hint and moves on Taiwan? Or when NATO allies realize America only stands with them when it’s convenient? Pulling support doesn’t end the war; it just ensures Ukraine loses.

And the corruption argument? Sure, Ukraine has problems. So do plenty of countries we support—including some we’ve gone to war for. But since when does corruption disqualify a country from defending itself? If that’s the standard, should we stop selling weapons to half the Middle East? Should we have abandoned France in World War II because of Vichy collaborators?

You don’t have to love Zelenskyy. You don’t even have to love Ukraine. But pretending that walking away is anything but a gift to Russia is either naïve or exactly the point.

But let’s be real. If someone invaded America and told us to hand over Texas or NY for “peace,” would you? Would Trump? Or would we fight like hell to keep what’s ours?

Trump doesn’t seem to grasp that. He talks like Ukraine should just fold, like it’s a bad poker hand he wouldn’t bother playing. He doesn’t see lives, homes, or an entire country fighting for survival… just a guy who didn’t flatter him enough before asking for help. 

Meanwhile, Putin doesn’t even have to lift a finger. Trump does the work for him, whether it’s insulting allies, weakening NATO, or making sure Russia gets what it wants without resistance.

1j2cn5x,CMV: MAGA’s Deep State Fantasy Ended With Elon Musk in Charge. An extensive take.,"Sorry it’s so long… 

But for years, conservatives ranted about the “deep state.” This shadowy unelected group of bureaucrats secretly running the government. Every problem? Blame the deep state. Every policy they didn’t like? Deep state sabotage. Every time Trump failed? Well, obviously, it wasn’t his fault… it was the deep state pulling the strings.

Turns out, that was all just a warm-up act. Because now, the government is actually being influenced by someone who wasn’t elected, who has unchecked power, and who answers to no one. Mr. Muskrat himself—Elon.

And he’s not even trying to hide it.

	“Either we get government efficient or America goes bankrupt. That’s what it comes down to.”

Which is rich, coming from a guy whose companies survive on government subsidies and taxpayer-funded contracts. But now instead of just cashing the checks, he gets to write them.

The GOP spent years screaming that unelected officials shouldn’t have this kind of power. Now they’ve handed Musk more control over federal agencies than any career bureaucrat EVER had. He’s slashing government jobs, deciding which departments get gutted, and consolidating power in ways that would’ve sent MAGA into a full meltdown if literally anyone else had tried it. If Biden had put Bill Gates or George Soros in charge of “fixing the government,” Fox News would be running 24-hour doomsday coverage. But since it’s their favorite billionaire, suddenly, it’s “necessary reform.”

Because the “deep state” was never real. It was just a convenient excuse to purge anyone who stood in their way and replace them with corporate overlords. And now they’ve got the richest one of all, calling the shots like some cyberpunk Lex Luthor.

And Musk? He’s treating this whole thing like a joke.

	“I still can’t believe @DOGE is real 😂😂😂 … but I think it’s actually going to work.”

Man is laughing about the fact that he’s now dismantling federal services. And Trump? He’s making sure no one questions it.

At a recent Cabinet meeting, he literally asked:

	“Is anybody unhappy with Elon? If you are, we’ll throw them out of here.”

And the whole room clapped and laughed. Because that’s what “government reform” looks like now. A bunch of yes-white-men letting an unelected billionaire run the country while pretending it’s some great anti-corruption movement.

But here’s where it gets even better:

Musk isn’t just running government operations… he’s directly profiting from them. Starlink gets Pentagon contracts. Tesla relies on government subsidies. SpaceX is functionally an extension of NASA (DOGE is cutting funds from NASA too). And now, with his newfound power inside Trump’s administration, he’s perfectly positioned to ensure that those contracts subsidies and regulatory decisions all benefit him personally.

You think some mid-level EPA official is the deep state? Try a guy who can redirect billions of taxpayer dollars into his own businesses while firing the people meant to regulate him.

And let’s not forget Musk’s obsession with controlling information. Twitter, sorry, “X”, was already his personal propaganda machine, but now he has direct access to government data, policy influence, and intelligence briefings. This is a man who platformed QAnon lunatics. He allowed Russian and Chinese state media to spread unchecked disinformation and personally meddled in Ukraine’s war efforts by limiting Starlink access. And now, he’s inside the actual machinery of government able to shape policy in ways that go far beyond a few algorithm tweaks.

And let’s not forget the data. Because you know he’s stealing it. The guy who already turned Twitter into a disinformation machine now has direct access to government databases and classified reports, and military intelligence and the entire federal digital infrastructure, huh? You think he’s not feeding Starlink, Tesla AI, and his private security company every piece of state intel he can get his hands on? He already leaks DMs to embarrass his enemies, what do you think he’s doing with access to federal employee records our financial data voter rolls, and military contracts?

And he’s not alone.

The Department of Government Efficiency is stacked with Musk loyalists. Random alt-right tech bros with no experience in public policy, but plenty of experience firing people over email. Government workers literally can’t get into their own offices because Musk’s hand-picked goons have changed the locks. Literally physically barring employees from entering federal buildings.

DOGE isn’t just gutting programs for the sake of “efficiency.” They’re cutting anything that doesn’t serve their ideology. Musk’s team killed a government-funded disinformation research program because it flagged right-wing conspiracy theories. They fired the entire team behind the IRS free tax filing system (convenient, since Musk hates taxes). And they’re scrubbing economic data to make Trump’s cuts look better on paper.

Meanwhile, Musk is actively engaging with far-right groups abroad. He’s signaled support for Germany’s far-right AfD party not just with money but with an actual hand signal aka the Nazi salute.(yes he did.) And he’s openly spreading election disinformation amplifying claims of foreign interference only when it benefits his preferred candidates.

But don’t worry he’s listening to us:

	“Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know!”

Oh cool, so when entire government departments disappear, we just, what? DM him? Should we tag him in a tweet between Tesla fanboys and crypto bros? 

And don’t bother with the “but Trump appointed him!” argument. That just proves the point. The deep state outrage was never about stopping unelected power. it was about making sure the right people controlled it. Republicans never cared about government corruption. They just wanted it working in their favor.

Musk didn’t expose the deep state. He rebranded it, made it profitable and turned it into a subscription service.

And the same people who spent years screaming about “unelected elites” running the government? They’re suddenly silent.. because the new elite is one of their own.

- Islam request Arabic
Islam forces its followers to pray and read Quran in Arabic compare to Christianity where you read the Bible and pray in your native language, Arabic is also the language of heavens in Islam, you need to say the shahada in Arabic to covert to Islam and even adhan (call for pray) is also required to be Arabic. Non-Arab Muslims uses Arabic terms like Inshallah, subhanallah, astaghfirallah and etc. 


-You need to be a descendants of Qurayshi Arabs to be a Caliphate

Many sunni hadiths have emphasized the Caliphate need to be descendants of Qurayshi (Muhammed's tribe for those who don't know) which's why a lot of Muslims don't consider non-Arab caliphates like ottomans to be a legit caliphate and anti-ottoman Arabs have used the fact they aren't Quaryashi to delegitmize them as true Caliphate, and there's many non-Arab Muslim rulers like Saladdin who fit all requirements of being a Caliphate except the fact that he was a Kurdish instead of being a Qurayshi Arab. 


- Islam is heavily Arab centric 

You required to do pilgrimage to two cities in Arabia as a Muslim, you idolize Arab figures like Omar, Abu bakr, Othman and Ali and Islam tells you to be live and act like prophet Muhammed (an Arab man), you follow an Arabic calender system, you required pray towards Mecca, non-Arab Muslims wear Arabic clothes like hijab, abya and thawb and non-Arab Muslims give their children Arabic names while non-Arabic names are looked down on.

1j47t8d,CMV: The probability of Trump being a Russian agent is high enough to be taken very seriously,"First of all, there are multiple [accounts ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/29/trump-russia-asset-claims-former-kgb-spy-new-book)of people who had worked in Soviet intelligence during 80s stating that Trump was actively cultivated as an asset during that time. Trump [first visited](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842/) Russia in 1987, before it became significantly easier for westerners to enter it. At that time the people who were actually invited from West to USSR were diplomats, people important for business reasons (e.g. providing expertise for some factory USSR wanted to build), PR (leftist authors, children, etc.) or (potential) intelligence assets. The formal reason for Trump's visit - building a Trump tower next to Kremlin seems less than realistic, but it served as a passable cover story for intelligence use (at least when Trump attracted less attention). It should also be noted that at approximately same time, Australia [rejected ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/trumps-bid-for-sydney-casino-30-years-ago-rejected-due-to-mafia-connections)his bid to build a casino there due to his ""mafia connections"" - meaning Trump likely was already not law-abiding citizen back then.

  
So there is a lot of evidence that Russia tried to recruit Trump. Given that Russia [provided him a lot of money](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/) later on, after Trump ran his earlier business into ground, it seems likely that the recruitment was successful

  
Once recruited he would be on the hook permanently. While as US president Trump would have enough of his own leverage to not be forced to automatically do everything Russia asked, Russia could cause him enough problems that they would be able to ""request"" him to perform services every now and then. It can also be noted that once it was pretty much certain that Trump was leaving White House, his counterleverage on Russia would be gone, and he could be forced into extra services - like, say, providing Russia with confidential documents, and every service provided to Russia would make it harder to extricate himself (as such arrangements usually work).

  
Similarly, once Trump won the election again, Russia would be VERY insistent that Trump do something about US support for Ukraine (at least once Trump got his most immediate priorities in order). However even among republicans there would be quite a significant number that would have issues with simply announcing the end of support to Ukraine. So a show would be needed to sell this idea. You may note how during Zelensky's visit to White House Vance did multiple attacks on Zelensky that he would have never dared without prior Trump's approval (if your boss invites someone for supposedly important deal, you don't just start attacking them out of the blue). So Trump and Vance discussed this in advance and the plan was to try to provoke Zelensky. This seems rather strange is Trump's actual priority was really the minerals. However it makes sense if Trump would prefer to look like a person who cared about US economic interests, while getting pretext to end support for Ukraine for reasons which at first glance involved mainly other people. That said, in that case even if Zelensky jumped through all the hoops and the deal did not fall apart, that could be made to work to both Russia and Trump's benefit, just slower. Trump would tout getting control over some of Ukraine's resources, Ukrainian (and European) economic situation would weaken, while Trump could a few months later find a myriad reasons why Ukraine was doing something wrong and the support had to be reduced/withheld anyway (it's not like Trump's supporters would care about his lack of consistency).



Now, there's a lot of various facts pointing to Trump having been recruited by Russia decades ago, and Russia probably still having sufficient leverage over him. It does not however amount to a smoking gun. You could argue however that with the current circumstantial evidence it looks sufficiently probable to become a significant factor in analysis and prediction of Trump's actions, and for the people with a stake in US politics to care about. To make an analogy, consider a person whose 3 previous spouses died under suspicious circumstances with that person inheriting money from each. It does not quite amount to proof of guilt, but it could be a sufficient reason for law enforcement to investigate this deeper, and if you or someone close to you was planning to become that person's 4th spouse, it would be quite reasonable to seriously take that past pattern into account, take significant precautions, and be alert for further pieces that would support that.

  
On the subject of investigations - the obvious question would be that Trump would be investigated under Biden for such links. The problem is that if Trump were to be accused, he'd immediately declare it a witch hunt, and when Trump had support of half the country, anything short of a smoking gun proof would be ignored by his supporters, and an attempt to arrest Trump could trigger a civil war. And even for a serious investigation it may be difficult to come up with smoking gun - even if e.g. decrypted text logs of Trump's communication with his handlers were produced, Trump would just declare them to be fake, and his supporters would not give it a second thought - which could have easily strengthened Trump's position at election by giving him a martyr card if the accusation was pressed - so it's quite probable that in such scenario Biden would choose to not rock the boat and hope that Trump would just not be able to win again.",Ancquar,7146,0.9100000262260436,803,1741194021,2025-03-05 11:00:21,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1j47t8d/cmv_the_probability_of_trump_being_a_russian/,3,2025
1j49p5o,CMV: MAGA Is A True Fascist Movement,"I'm using R. Griffin's definition palingenetic ultra-nationalism, or true fascism, to identify MAGA.

The two components of this ideology is the palingenetic *myth* and populist *ultra-nationalism.*

Definitions:

Palingenetic myth: “a generic term for the vision of a radically *new* beginning which follows a period of destruction or perceived dissolution.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 33)

“At the heart of the palingenetic political myth lies the belief that contemporaries are living through or about to live through a 'sea-change', a 'water-shed' or 'turning-point' in the historical process. The perceived corruption, anarchy, oppressiveness, iniquities or decadence of the present, rather than being seen as immutable and thus to be endured indefinitely with stoic courage or bleak pessimism, are perceived as having reached their peak and interpreted as the sure sign that one era is nearing its end and a new order is about to emerge.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 35)

Populist: “a generic term for political forces which, even if led by a small elite cadres or self-appointed 'vanguard', in practice or in principle (and not merely for show) depend on 'people power' as the basis for legitimacy.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 36-37)

Ultra-nationalism: “forms of nationalism which 'go beyond', and hence reject, anything compatible with liberal institutions or with the tradition of Enlightenment humanism which underpins it.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 37)

“Populist ultra-nationalism rejects the principles both of absolutism and of pluralist representative government. ... it thus repudiates both 'traditional' and 'legal/rational' forms of politics in favour of prevalently 'charismatic' ones in which the cohesion and dynamics of movements depends almost exclusively on the capacity of their leaders to inspire loyalty and action.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 37)

Palingenetic ultra-nationalism: “a genus of political energy... whose mobilizing vision is that of *the national community rising phoenix-like after a period of encroaching decadence which all but destroyed it*.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 38)

In short, this is the *fascist minimum*, palingenetic ultra-nationalism, MAGA.

Applying the definitions to Trump and MAGA:

The Make America Great Again slogan conjures the palingenetic myth. His rhetoric of empty promises of America's new Golden Age (only for the billionaires), and constant blaming of the 'deep state', immigrants, cultural Marxists, liberals, 'unhumans' and so on and so forth hindering their march into a fairy-tale future. These groups are identified as the *existing order* that caused America to become corrupt and decadent, that the system needs overthrown so a new utopian Golden Age can begin.

“Yet the predominance of the utopian component... also has two important practical consequences which several *limit* its effectiveness as a political force. First, the core myth of palingenetic ultra-nationalism is susceptible to so many nuances of interpretation in terms of specific 'surface' ideas and policies that... it tends to generate a wide range of competing currents and factions even within the same political culture...” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 39)

Currently, there are three main factions within the MAGA party.

1. The Dark Enlightenment oligarchs, whose palingenetic myth entails the ascendance of a *patchwork* of techno-monarchy city-states out of the destruction of civilization they create. One of the founders of the Dark Enlightenment philosophy, Curtis Yarvin, is also the architect of the butterfly revolution and designed the blueprints for DOGE's RAGE.

1. The Christian Nationalists, with their dream of cleansing the nation of all the sinful and decadent liberals, merging church and state to form a Christian nation or 'heaven on Earth' out of the rubble. This is the goal of Project 2025.
2. The MAGA Ultra-nationalists, whose visions have never been truly articulated other than 'bringing back' some Golden Age I can only assume some version of a nostalgic fairy-tale society that was only ever depicted in 1950s advertisements.

It is important to note that all these factions share some version of the palingenetic myth. They are all working together to achieve the destruction of the current order, the toppling of America's constitutional republic. They differ on what comes after the destruction, and have no real idea what it will be, like the dog who finally catches up to the car.

There can never been a light at the end of the tunnel for Trump and MAGA, the Golden Age will eternally be just beyond the horizon. They will have to endlessly create new 'enemies from within' and without preventing them from achieving their promised utopia. It will not end with rounding up all the immigrants or conquering Greenland and Canada, there will always be new enemies in their eternal struggle for 'MAGA'.

“Second, it means that fascism is in its element as an oppositional ideology only as long as the climate of national crisis prevails... it can only maintain its momentum and cohesion by continually precipitating events which seemed to fulfil the promise of permanent revolution, of continuing palingenesis.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 40)

“In a grotesque travesty of Faustian restlessness, fascism cannot permit itself to linger on a bed of contentment: its arch-enemy is the 'normality' of human society in equilibrium, its Achilles heel as a form of practical politics the utopianism which the fear of this enemy breeds.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 40)

“Without precise objectives the fascist must move forward all the time, but just because precise objectives are lacking he can never stop, and every goal attained is a stage on the continuous treadmill of the future he claims to construct, of the national destiny he claims to fulfil. Fascist dynamism comes at the price of this, and therein lies its profound revolutionary nature, but also it seems the seeds of its eventual fall.” (E. Weber, 1964, p 78)

I think everyone, even the most mindless of Trump's followers, can agree that Trump is a populist. He has mastered the art of demagoguery, every lie that spews out of his mouth resonates with his base.

“Admittedly, the concept of the organic national community connotes classlessness, unfettered social mobility and an abolition of the inequities of *laissez-faire* capitalism in a way which allowed some of its ideologues to claim to represent 'true' democracy. Yet power in the new community would remain descending rather than ascending even after the rebirth (in any case an ongoing process) had been inaugurated in a new order, for it would be concentrated in the hands of those who had risen 'naturally' through the ranks of the various hierarchical organizations in which all the political, economic and cultural energies of the nation were to be channelled and orchestrated. In a mystic version of direct democracy, the representation of the people's general will in a fascist society would mean entrusting authority to an elite or (especially in its inter-war versions) a leader whose mission it is to safeguard the supra-individual interests and destiny of the people to whom it (or he) claims to be linked by a metaphysical bond of a common nationhood. A paradox thus lies at the heart of fascist ultra-nationalism. It is populist in intent and rhetoric, yet elitist in practice.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 41)

This elitist form of populism, this top-down hierarchical structure, means the *charismatic leader* decides what the 'will of the people' is, which then flows down to 'the people'. The movements gains its power through the leader. Was MAGA calling for the invasion of Greenland, or was Trump (at the request of the Dark Enlightenment oligarch Dryden Brown)? How about tariffs to impoverish everyday Americans, is that the 'will of the people'?

“The most obvious symptom of the reliance of both on charismatic power is, of course, the leader cult, which in both regimes \[a reference to Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy\] became increasingly important to paper over the widening cracks between propaganda and reality. ...However, the very success of an individual in becoming the charismatic leader of a fascist movement, and even mounting an assault on state power, is also its Achille's heel. In the long run the law of entropy which applies to the innovatory or expansionist momentum of a regime will also affect the leader himself. It will do so inexorably and in a way which the most efficient propaganda machine in the world cannot conceal indefinitely: he will grow infirm and eventually die.” (R. Griffin, 1991, p. 42)

MAGA contain all essential ingredients of palingenetic ultra-nationalism (true fascism).

On social media I constantly see conservatives being absolutely delighted by “liberal tears” and salivating over people “kicking and screaming” or “seething” etc, or about how much the perpetrators are “owning the libs”, “winning” or “dominating” etc. Why is the primary measure of the effectiveness of a conservative policy how miserable it makes people?

Veteran homelessness? Still a crisis. Veteran suicides? Still happening at ~17 per day. The VA budget? Shrinking… unless you count the part that gets funneled to private contractors. Meanwhile, defense spending stays sky-high because supporting the military only counts when there’s a war to fight.

When John McCain, a POW, criticized him, he mocked his capture. This isn’t new. The GOP loves to perform patriotism, until veterans need something that doesn’t fit on a bumper sticker.

1j8csfy,"CMV: The President of China (Xi Jinping) is now the most powerful person on Earth, not the president of America.","We were living in an American Century. Since World War 2, the President of the United States has been considered the most powerful person in the world. However, I believe that title now belongs to Xi Jinping, and not to Donald Trump (or any US president). 

China's economy cannot be understated. It has been the world's largest economy (PPP) for over a decade now. The country is a manufacturing giant, controls massive amounts of global supply chains, and has significant leverage over international trade. Not to mention it has 1.4 billion people to serve as its workforce, consumer base, and anything else the CCP needs.

The US, once the uncontested global leader, is in a state of deep political division, economic struggles, and social unrest. Partisan infighting, government gridlock, and internal strife make it harder for any president—especially Trump—to wield power effectively. The US’s global influence has also been waning as China expands its reach through its growing Belt and Road Empire.

The most significant factor is the difference in governance. The US president operates within a democratic system that imposes limits on power—courts, Congress, elections, media scrutiny, and public opinion all act as constraints. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping is an authoritarian leader who has effectively consolidated power, removed term limits, cracked down on dissent, and expanded surveillance and social control. In other words, he can dictate policies with little resistance, while a US president is constantly facing checks and opposition (despite what Trump and DOGE are trying).

China is making strategic moves to replace the US as the dominant global force. It is investing in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, gaining influence in regions the US has neglected. It is also developing economic alliances that reduce reliance on the dollar and expanding military capabilities, particularly in the South China Sea.

Putin might have been sabotaging America, but China is the real winner of America's repeated own goals. The USA still has massive soft power, but who knows how much longer that will last considering divisions and the current administration. The world order is shifting, and it’s time to acknowledge that the most powerful person on Earth might no longer be sitting in the White House.

1j8qwwt,"CMV: If Democrats Gain Full Control, They Have Every Right to Prosecute Republicans and Their Allies Who Have Weaponized Government for Political Gain","The current American administration has demonstrated a relentless campaign against anything they consider progressive or left-leaning. Through their attacks on Democrats, the weaponization of the DOJ, and even the reported revocation of security clearances for law firms representing figures like Jack Smith, they have set a dangerous precedent.

For years, Republicans have accused Democrats of “weaponizing government,” yet under this administration, we’ve seen an actual systematic effort to punish political opponents, undermine legal accountability, and shield powerful conservative figures from scrutiny. If Democrats regain control of the presidency, Senate, and House, they not only have the right but the duty to bring to account those who have engaged in corruption, abuse of power, and the dismantling of democratic norms.

This should not be done out of pure political retaliation but as a necessary step to uphold the rule of law. If individuals like Trump, his enablers in Congress, and powerful conservative figures like Elon Musk have engaged in unlawful activities, they should face real legal consequences.

1j8ugsg,CMV: Anti Woke discourse is simply a euphemism for the eradication of civil rights.," It is not acceptable to say, “Black people are gaining too much social power and must be put back into their place.”

So they say, “Enough of this woke bullshit.”

It is no longer acceptable to say, “These LGBT+ individuals are ruining family values and must be eliminated.”

So they say, “The woke virus is infecting our children.”

It is less socially acceptable to say, “Women are destroying industry and must be forced into homemaking and child-rearing.”

So they say, “Woke feminism is destroying the women of America.”

Some argue that opposition to “wokeness” is simply about rejecting extremism. But in practice, anti-woke rhetoric overwhelmingly targets marginalized groups, civil rights progress, and efforts toward inclusion—not radical or fringe ideas. The radical/fringe ideas are used as justification for the elimination of rights across the board.

And any time the experts present hard data that opposes their views, they either suggest that said experts are part of a conspiracy and are paid to lie, or they turn to a small minority (usually less than 5%) of experts who disagree with them. Some examples:

*they believe they understand climate change better than geologists, archeologists, and meteorologists

*they believe they understand carbon dating better than archeologists

*they believe they understand vaccines and infectious diseases better than doctors and medical researches who have dedicated their life’s work to the subjects

*they believe they understand inflation and tariffs better than economists

*they believe they understand the motivations of Putin better than the CIA, who spends $70 billion per year gathering intel (along with the intelligence agencies of the entire western world)

It genuinely seems like for every major issue facing this country, Republicans blatantly dismiss the views of experts and dismiss them as paid shills who are part of a grand conspiracy

1j9342a,CMV: MAGA loves ‘Free Speech’ until the speaker Is brown.,"
Mahmoud Khalil was arrested in the middle of the night. No charges. No trial. No warrant. ICE agents dragged a lawful permanent resident out of his home in front of his pregnant wife and locked him in a Louisiana detention center, 1,300 miles away. He is a husband, a researcher, a recent graduate with a master’s degree… But he is also Palestinian. And he protested. He’s not a criminal. He’s not a terrorist. He legally  protested… 

No one voted for this. No one passed a law saying ICE can disappear people for having the wrong opinions. No one decided protesting was a crime. But somehow, Trump did. He went online after the arrest, called Khalil a “Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student,” and made sure everyone knew: “The first arrest of many to come.”

That should piss off anyone who believes in freedom.

The government now has the power to grab any legal resident and call them a national security threat… without proof, without a trial, without due process. If you think that power stays aimed at people you don’t like, you haven’t been paying attention.

A Chinese PhD student at UC Berkeley was arrested last week for attending a pro-Palestinian protest. No criminal act, no violence, just speech. Trump is already talking about stripping citizenship from people he deems “un-American.” He’s promising mass deportations, mass arrests, mass punishment for people who speak out against him.

What exactly does “the first of many” mean? Who else is on that list?

It’s funny how the same people who screamed about weaponized government, who swore the deep state was coming for them, who chanted “Free Speech!” every time someone got banned from Twitter, are now completely fine with ICE detaining people over their political views. The ones who said the Second Amendment exists to resist tyranny now shrug when the First is trampled.

Maybe it’s different when it’s someone else’s rights being erased. Maybe the Constitution only matters when it’s your speech on the line. But that’s not how freedom works. If the government can disappear one legal resident without charges, they can do it to anyone.

If that doesn’t bother you, just say you never cared about liberty in the first place.

Ideally some insight on maybe the technicalities of what the bill is compared to a mpre comprehensive budget - are they going to fight harder come the end of this stopgap bill? 

I need something far more detailed than ""Trump and Musk could do more if Govt were shut down"" - how, specifically, and by what mechanisms, and how would that be worse than their attempts to do roughly the same already? 

I also want to know, as a follow-up, if this wasn't a good enough reason for Dems to use what is roughly their only real leverage in the minority - the filibuster - what is? When will they use it, and why then and not now? 

If you tell me that the reasoning is that voters would blame Dems for the shut down, then you'll need to explain how this (https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3921) is wrong: 

>If a government shutdown does occur, 32 percent of voters say they would blame Democrats in Congress the most, 31 percent say they would blame Republicans in Congress the most, 22 percent say they would blame President Trump the most, and 15 percent did not offer an opinion.

The Arab world is the laughing stock of the world, nobody take us seriously or want Arab immigrants in their countries, why should they? Out of 22 Arab countries, 10 are failed states, 5 are stable but poor and has authoritarian regimes, 6 are rich, but with theocratic monarchies where slavery is still practiced. The only democracy with decent human rights in the Arab world is Tunisia who's poor and last year they have elected a dictator wannabe. 


And the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq are just embarrassing, Arabs are killing eachother over something that happened 1400 years ago (battle of Karabala) while we are seeing the west trying to get colonize mars. 


I don't think Arabs are capable to make a developed democratic state that doesn't violate human rights, its either secular dictatorship or Islamic dictatorship. When the Arabs have a democracy they always vote for an Islamic dictatorship instead like what happened in Palestine, Iraq, Egypt and Tunisia.

Fascism is more narrowly defined as an ideology that exalts nation and race over individual rights and is associated with dictatorial leaders and forceful suppression of opposition. This seems very counter to American ideologies.

Last election both words were thrown around in liberal doses- each used literally millions of times on the non stop political ads we all had to endure. And we all know how that went.

This is proof that the anti-woke, anti-DEI movement is based exclusively on anti-minority racism, and elimination of non-white societal participation. 

Jackie Robinson is an important historical figure as he broke the color barrier in a major sport, during the Jim Crow era. The sheer fact the people are willing to eliminate the existence of a person of color under claims that it was ""DEI"" is proof that the anti-DEI movement is about the restoration of 1900's era Social Darwinism and avocation of white superiority. 

The removal of Jackie Robinson's military history was only detected and reversed when ESPN noticed it and brought it up. Also highlighting the importance of media in society as a check on government actions.

The internal dialog goes something like: ""I've become a billionaire; therefore, I must possess an unquantifiable genius that the rest of the population lacks. My bank account proves it."" They become drunk on the myth of their own genius. 

They never stop to ask themselves tough and reflective questions like, ""Was I just lucky?"" or ""Am I the beneficiary of a perfectly-timed investment and shifting industry?"" 

Elon is a classic case of a rich kid who had access to capital just as the US tech industry was exploding. He made some great investments, sure. But for every guy like Elon who made it, there are hundreds of others who may be smarter but simply weren't as lucky. They've now lost everything, where Elon has survived. Statistically, there will always be some lucky survivors; they aren't geniuses. 

Now that Elon's personal brand is imploding, he is again looking to external causes rather than asking himself the tough and reflective question: ""Did my behavior cause this?""

Executives tend to credit their quick thinking when the company succeeds but blame the 'economy' when it fails. ""It can never be me.""

So, Elon's crash is coming. It will be bigger than Elizabeth Holmes.' The video clip of him gleefully wielding a chainsaw as he simulates cutting family-supporting federal jobs will one day be the cover art on the tell-all documentary.

Using a commercial messaging up to share sensitive information about American military operations is an enormous breach of information security, and, as many in the linked articles have opined, this kind of breach could have harmed the lives of American intelligence and military personnel.

Given the current state of the government, I imagine that Hegseth will walk away from this with little more than a slap on the wrist.

1jjsvgx,CMV: I don't believe the Signal leak was an accident.,"When this story first came out, I bought the narrative that it was a blunder, but the more I read about it that theory doesn't make sense to me anymore.

The problem is not that I don't think they're incompetent enough to do it, but rather who it was that was added and when.  Michael Waltz added Jeffrey Goldberg as a connection two days before adding him to this small group, it was their first communication.  That first connection invite had to be established before he could be added to the group.  

If someone was going to leak a national security story, Jeffrey Goldberg is on a very short list of national security reporters with the experience, credibility, and platform who could be trusted to get this story out without compromising the operation or American intelligence methods.

So in order to believe this was a mistake we have to accept that someone made a new connection with this very specific person two days before the working group began and then accidentally added them to a conversation that pertains to their beat as a journalist.  

I can see accidentally adding someone to a chat, but it seems too great a coincidence that it was this particular person added just two days after a connection was first made.  

So if not a mistake, then what.

1. It's an intentional leak by the Trump team, possibly to put pressure on Europe, score some political point, or accomplish some interpersonal court politics type hit on someone you don't like.  This is possible, but it seems unlikely they would put themselves through this level of embarrassment and blowback when the same ends could've been accomplished in other ways.

2.  It's a whistleblower.  Possibly not even about the strike on the Houthis, but someone concerned that these conversations are happening on Signal at all.  Besides the obvious security concerns, what may be more consequential is that these conversations aren't be recorded and thus can't be FOIA'd.  If high-level discussions are consistently occurring over Signal it may be a strategy to get around the Presidential Records Act and shield themselves from legal scrutiny. 

Option 2 seems the most likely to me right now, but I admit it might be overly optimistic to believe there's a person willing to fall on the sword for the greater good in that room.",MattVideoHD,1923,0.9100000262260436,295,1742933164,2025-03-25 15:06:04,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jjsvgx/cmv_i_dont_believe_the_signal_leak_was_an_accident/,3,2025

He's now being besmirched by some people who were allegedly in that thread.

In the senate intelligence committee hearing, multiple times the DNI and the Director of the CIA have said that nothing classified was discussed in that signal thread. 

These are very high ranking intelligence officials... Kind of the highest ranking even. If they're not sure on whether classified material was present in that chat they should have said they didn't know and it's being looked into but they didn't. Instead they said there was not classified material in that thread. 

I think the best move by the Atlantic here, and this is being extremely generous on their part would be to put out a statement quoting the denial of classified material by these high ranking intelligence officials and say something like ""okay... final answer guys? because we didn't release this because it seemed classified to our journalists but if you're saying it's not we're going to release it"" and then release it if no statement is made or if another denial is issued.

TLDR: High ranking intelligence officials are saying that there wasn't classified material in this thread. If true, then the material should be released.

You don't threaten another country's sovereignty the way Trump has and expect things to go back to how they were any time soon with those people.

Let's be clear, a lot of the reasons why Canadians came to the US is because prior to Trump, they liked us.  Now, they don't because of Trump and will find we really don't offer anything unique that no other place offers and when that happens, they won't come back at all. 

 Florida? They can go to Cancun or the Caribbean. New York? Hello, Toronto.  Las Vegas?

1jlfocq,CMV: It’s bad that the state department revoked the visa of a Rumeysa Ozturk without providing any evidence of wrongdoing,"On Tuesday evening, a Tufts graduate student was detained by ICE in Somerville, MA. The student had a valid student visa but it was revoked on Tuesday. The department of homeland security claimed that the student supported Hamas and for that reason her visa was revoked. No details or evidence was provided to support that claim.

The student has not been charged with any crime. The only two actions news outlets have identified that the student took related to the Hamas-Israel war were to publish an article and help organize a potluck to support Palestinian students. The article was published in the student newspaper and argued that Tufts University should follow the recommendations of the student union resolution to boycott Sabra, divesting from Israeli companies, and condemn the genocide of Palestinians.

I think it’s wrong that a student would have their visa revoked and then be detained in a prison in Louisiana without any evidence of wrongdoing being presented.

1jmkhau,CMV: Conservatives are fundamentally uninterested in facts/data.,"In fairness, I will admit that I am very far left, and likely have some level of bias, and I will admit the slight irony of basing this somewhat on my own personal anecdotes. However I do also believe this is supported by the trend of more highly educated people leaning more and more progressive.

However I always just assumed that conservatives simply didn't *know* the statistics, and that if they learned them they would change their opinion based on that new information. I have been proven wrong countless times however, both online, in person, while canvasing. It's not a matter of presenting data, neutral sources, meeting them in the middle. They either refuse to engage with things like studies and data completely, or they decide that because it doesn't agree with their intuition that it must be somehow ""fake"" or invalid. 

When I talk to these people and ask them to provide a source of their own, or what is informing their opinion, they either talk directly past it, or the conversation ends right there. I feel like if you're asked a follow up like ""Oh where did you get that number?"" and the conversation suddenly ends, it's just an admission that you're pulling it out of your ass, or you saw it online and have absolutely no clue where it came from or how legitimate it is. It's frustrating. 

I'm not saying there aren't progressives who have lost the plot and don't check their information, however I feel like it's championed among conservatives. Conservatives have pushed for decades at this point to destroy trust in any kind of academic institution, boiling them down to ""indoctrination centers."" They have to, because otherwise it looks glaring that the 5 highest educated states in the US are the most progressive and the 5 lowest are the most conservative, so their only option is to discredit academic integrity. 

I personally am wrong all the time, it's a natural part of life. If you can't remember the last time you were wrong, then you are simply ignorant to it.

1jmlvp4,CMV: it is disrespectful and disingenuous to not make the distinction between legal and illegal immigrants.,"I’m a Chinese Canadian that immigrated legally with my family, so my view is definitely influenced by this experience.

When I look at online and real life discussions of Trump’s deportation plans and border issues and similar, more often than not, people participating in the discussion omit the word “illegal” when in fact, they are talking about illegal immigration. 

This feels highly disingenuous, as the purposeful removal of the word “illegal” seems to be whitewashing, or muddying the illegality, of border crossing or overstaying. I think it is intentionally misleading when people say “migrants” or “immigrants”, when in reality they are referring to undocumented migrants.

It is also very much disrespectful to those to worked hard, studied English, passed exams, took a risk for their children, all while respecting the law, to lump them together with illegal immigrants. Asking questions like “why do you hate immigrants?” is disingenuous, useless, and straight up disrespectful. This type of ambiguity hinders a genuine discussion, because the people who refuse to make the distinction are intentionally watering down the obvious illegality of illegal immigration.

The only exception that I can understand is if your moral/political beliefs involve the right of migration and dismantling of international borders, which by definition eliminates the need to make the distinction of the legality of the migrants.

My argument is that, if you want a discussion that is genuine and respectful, you must specify the type of immigration in question.",IncidentHead8129,1115,0.8100000023841858,710,1743253616,2025-03-29 08:06:56,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jmlvp4/cmv_it_is_disrespectful_and_disingenuous_to_not/,3,2025
1jmt165,CMV: American soft power is being steadily wiped out,"As we all know, American soft power is currently in the dumps, with many people outside the country either viewing it as a laughingstock or trembling in fear of it. Few people seem to actually respect and want to cooperate with it anymore.

A big reason of course is Donald Trump. Not only has he alienated the rest of the democratic world by withdrawing support from Ukraine and cozying up with autocrats, but by threatening to conquer Canada and Greenland he has made the people of these countries see the US as an aggressive monster. And America’s international reputation won’t be repaired after he leaves, since everyone will know that every election the US has a 50% chance of electing a capricious Republican. Hell, America’s reputation is arguably still damaged from the Bush II administration.

But it goes beyond Donald Trump. Already the US is seen as a laughingstock due to our lack of universal healthcare, poor labor and food safety standards, lack of walkability, and now our regression on social issues. It has gone as far as when people consider immigrating to the US (eg in r/IWantOut) the default response is “no don’t come here it’s too dangerous and it sucks compared to other developed nations.”

And American companies are losing influence too. Most prominently, the US auto industry is fated to become like the East German auto industry. Coddled by tariffs, they are being bodied by the Chinese auto industry on the world stage. Chinese electrical vehicle brands like BYD are dominating in places as diverse as Southeast Asia and Australia and are making massive inroads into Europe. Soon, American cars will only be viable in the American domestic market. Just look at the number of posts lamenting the lack of affordable Chinese cars in r/electricvehicles in the US. Similar things can be said about the American drones (nonexistent), renewables (threatened by Trump and was behind China beforehand), or AI (which seemed like a bright spot until Deepseek showed up).

And soon, even the most prominent manifestation of American soft power - Hollywood and the arts - will be on the decline. The reason I actually made this CMV is because there is currently massive drama surrounding the SAG-AFTRA voice actor guild. Originally American VAs have been striking for AI protections, leading to games like Genshin Impact to be unvoiced for months. However, people realized that it wasn’t just about AI protections; SAG-AFTRA also wanted to maintain a monopoly on VA work, where only union members can work on projects. This came to a head when Hoyoverse (the Chinese company behind Genshin) hired a Japan-based VA to replace a striking American VA, causing him to be denounced as a scab by SAG-AFTRA VAs and putting the Genshin community in turmoil (just search “SAG-AFTRA controversy” in r/Genshjn_Impact).

Now, people are predicting that Hoyoverse and other international companies will avoid hiring American VAs like the plague, in order to avoid SAG-AFTRA’s monopoly. Already, most new English voices in Genshin and Wuthering Waves (another Chinese video game) have been from the UK. Furthermore, people are using this opportunity to highlighting how backwards the US is in general, from the general nastiness of both US labor laws and labor unions, to China having stronger AI protections (despite Chinese people being more AI-friendly than Americans).

So the trend is unmistakable: the international community, in both the political and economic spheres, are increasingly shunning the US. By the end of Trump’s term, I predict the US will look like Russia: a hated, isolated country whose most prominent exports are agricultural and petrochemical products, which arms sales if we’re lucky. Meanwhile, China, buoyed by its national champions like BYD and Hoyoverse, is set to take its place as the world’s global superpower.",ice_cold_fahrenheit,910,0.8700000047683716,328,1743273511,2025-03-29 13:38:31,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jmt165/cmv_american_soft_power_is_being_steadily_wiped/,3,2025

1jmxqrn,"CMV: The most effective way to fight back against this administration is to label every upcoming economic struggle as ""The Republican Recession""","GDP forecasts a -5.8% swing, from 2.8% growth in 2024 to -2.8% decline in 2025 https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow

My reasons why this is the most effective way to resist the current administration if you're unhappy with it are:

1- Due to Republicans controlling all branches of the government, putting all your effort into pressuring Democrats is ineffective. The Democratic Party is weak right now.

2- The only real way to limit Trump's power right now is to get Republicans in Congress to actually push back against his illegal executive orders. Trump has stacked too many loyalist judges, relying on the judicial branch to stop Trump is not an effective way to resist this administration

3- Trump has shown he's immune to anything bad sticking to him. Most people who resist Trump have spent all their effort trying to get dirt to land on Trump despite him openly bragging about sexual assault with zero consequence. At some point you need to realize your strategy of targeting Trump is ineffective and target someone else - the Republican party

4- This hits Republicans right where it hurts. They'll be especially sensitive to the Republican Recession narrative. The Republican party has built their foundation on being the party that's best for the economy, despite the numbers clearly showing that economies grow better under Democrats administrations. If Democrats can undermine this belief it's the easiest path to winning back Congress in the midterms

5- A big reason why Republicans have been able to dominate the narrative is Democrats lack focus with their attacks, lack simple phrases that trickle down to disengaged voters, and argue their positions in a intellectual way that doesn't resonate with less educated/informed voters. Labeling every economic struggle as part of the ""Republican Recession"" fixes these problems. It's simple messaging everyone can understand, it can be repeated over and over in many situations to drive the point home, and it is heavily sticky to the Republican party. They can't run from it. 

These are my reasons why labeling every economic struggle as ""The Republican Recession"" is the most effective way for everyday people to fight back against this administration. While many will likely try to change my view by arguing against one of the many opinions I've shared, the most effective way to change my view will be to show another way that's more effective for an individual to resist this administration.

1jmys49,"CMV: If only “citizens” are entitled to due process, then no one is entitled to due process.","If the President holds the ultimate authority to declare someone a non citizen , revoke their status without due process , and deport them, then that means no one gets due process. 

Picture you are a born citizen of the US. You were birthed by citizens, and you are a citizen. You have a passport , a drivers license, an SS number. You also have a social media account where you speak out against the current administration’s actions. You are walking to your car after a long day of work and you are immediately swarmed by ICE agents. They tell you that you’re under arrest for not being a citizen because the administration has labeled your online activity as terrorist behavior and the President has deemed you a threat to the country. 

This is where due process comes in. You tell them wait, no, I have a birth certificate and a passport, they’re just back at home. Normally with due process you would get the opportunity to present those documents in front of an immigration judge, but with the Presidents new executive power, since he has unilaterally denied you a non citizen , well that means you aren’t entitled to due process and you’re being shipped to a torture prison in El Salvadore.

I am not a lawyer, but in theory that means that what, say, ICE is doing by illegally deporting people for having soccer tattoos should still land them in prison. 

But the thing is, if the courts decide they have no teeth in their diseased gums, that not only is Trump is immune, but also anyone following Trump's orders is immune ,then they have no power to do anything real at all. Everything the courts say and do is a meaningless gesture.   
  
Like, under those circumstances once his continued monstrosity is normalized enough (which they are shockingly skilled at doing), ICE will just start machine gunning down protestors and congresspeople.

1jslh6d,CMV: Muslims are afforded a right to be bigoted in a way other groups aren’t.,"In my experience, Muslims in the West are given almost a carte blanche to be as hateful as they please, in a way that no other group is. For example, Charlottesville was universally condemned. Nobody was justifying the angry mob yelling that Jews will not replace us. On the other hand, when Muslim students organize riots on college campuses that are in support of a terrorist organization that is racist, sexist, antisemitic, and opposed to western values, people call it free speech.

A study was published recently that showed that people were more likely to be in favor of the deportation of a European student for harassing Jews than a Palestinian/Muslim student who engaged in the same behavior. 

It seems like society is so afraid of being called Islamophobic that Muslims end up getting a free pass for behavior that wouldn’t be acceptable from anyone else. People oppose homophobia, unless it’s the Muslim city council in Michigan passing a resolution to ban gay pride flags from public property.

The MeToo movement was very talked about and of course people stood against r*pists and sexual assault. Then October 7th happened and suddenly everyone was blaming Jewish women for being sexually assaulted by Muslims or accused the victims of lying for gain.

This plays out in very dangerous ways, too. People fall into a bigotry of low expectations with regards to rampant human rights abuses in Muslim countries. People storm the streets for women’s rights in the west, but are silent when it comes to middle eastern women being forbidden from the most basic rights, such as the right to even speak out loud or choose what to wear. 

For years, and especially since October 7th, people have said that Muslims/Palestinians have a “right” to be bigoted against Jews because of perceived grievances. Those same people would never excuse antisemitism from a white person.

What this doesn't cover? Organizations do exist and often engage in logistics. They may print signs or bring in sound equipment, etc. This is different than the claim that protestors were being paid to attend the protests across the us yesterday. 

Organizers are not protestors. Here's why. J6 was organized by women for America first. A pro trunp organization led by Amy Kremer. This group worked on securing permits, booking speakers, getting a stage and sound system, etc. This does not mean that Amy Kremer paid those present at January 6th, and the January 6ers were also not paid protesters. 

Women for America first is also not a non profit organization which means it is far less transparent than other groups that are doing similar logistics. Unlike many non profits. The origins of the funding for Women for America first have never been disclosed. Really. We have no idea who paid for January 6. However, even in this extreme example I wouldn't argue that J6ers were paid protestors. 

What would change my view? Evidence anyone attending the protestors yesterday was being paid for protesting.

1jsox9n,CMV: America has no way to remove Trump due to its ridiculously entrenched laws for the preservation of the presidency.,"All the protests, discontents, negative poll numbers, and even a majority republican dissent will NOT be able to remove Trump from office. 

They have tried to impeach Trump twice, and it did not work. 

If impeaching Trump for actual CRIMES did not work, then the constitution has NOTHING else to enable the removal of a US president. 

He would literally have to kill an innocent person on video to be successfully removed from office. 

Incompetence, greed, selfishness, gross negligence, ignorance, egomaniacal, general scumminess, ruining the economy and foreign relation, even actual fascism will NOT be enough to remove Trump, because American laws for removing the president is so weak that nothing sort of an actual horrible crime (murder, rape, treason) can lead to a successful prosecution and removal. 

A ""No confidence"" vote is not a thing for the American presidency. 

""But sir, surely actual fascism is enough to remove the President, right?"" -- I don't think so, because by then it would be too damn late and all the laws will be changed to keep him in power, Nazi style. 

It's relatively easy to vote someone into the presidency but ridiculously hard to remove them before their end of term. 

Trump could literally turn America upside down and inside out, dragging the world down with America and STILL remain in office. 

If any American constitutional/law/presidency experts could change my view on this, please enlighten me. I would LOVE to be proven wrong because this is becoming absolutely ridiculous.

1jszk88,CMV: Gen Z has more in common with Boomers than Millennials.,"There’s obviously a difference in values, but in terms of attitude, behavior, and general vibe, Gen Z actually shares more with Boomers than they do with Millennials. Why? Well…

	1.	They’re kind of isolationist.

Gen Z seems more withdrawn. They value alone time and don’t love socializing outside their comfort zone. Which means…

	2.	Neither are great at emotional communication in person.

Gen Z often struggles to express feelings face-to-face. They shut down or avoid important conversations entirely. Kinda Boomer-ish, right? Different reasons, similar result. This creates…

	3.	Rigid belief systems.

Gen Z tends to adopt strong, black-and-white views—much like Boomers clinging to fixed worldviews. There’s less room for nuance or gray areas. Which is why…

	4.	Both love secondhand outrage.

There’s a shared grumpiness. Gen Z gets fired up over stuff that doesn’t affect them directly. Boomers did the same - just with a different set of values. Which brings me to…

	5.	Societal rule enforcement.

Gen Z is big on calling people out for breaking unspoken social rules. Boomers loved rules too - just old-school ones. And this really shows up on social media, because guess what, both are…

	6.	Chronically online

Boomers are Facebook addicts, Gen Z are TikTok addicts. Different platforms, same result: constant outrage and a worldview shaped by the algorithm. But the pièce de résistance…

	7.	Both think Millennials are cringey.

Boomers and Gen Z hate looking stupid. Millennials didn’t have that luxury - they grew up online, testing boundaries to figure out what was “too far.” Gen Z is way more self-aware and peer-policed, so they play it safe. Boomers just call this “dignity.”

I’m obviously not saying all Gen Z or Boomers as individuals are the same. But taking the tropes, clichés, and general vibe you get from each generation… if you strip away the aesthetics and politics, Gen Z sometimes feels like Boomer 2.0. Just younger, sassier and with better skincare routines.

Occupy wall street didn't fix the finance system. BLM didn't improve policing. The womens march didn't improve access to women's healthcare.

This new movement will do the same. 

I think that in order to make a meaningful change your goals need to be specific and tailored. For example a good protest would be to go to a state house demanding that you want to be a sanctuary state. A bad protest would be to go to a state house to let them know how much you disagree with the president. 

A more effective (not the most effective) path towards social change would be email campaigns. You can directly tell the individual in power what change you want to see and why you want to see it and that you will not vote for them if this change is not enacted.

1jubiil,CMV: The 2024 Election could have been stolen and there is enough evidence to start state level investigations.,"Hello Redditors,

I’m fairly new to Reddit and social media (I know, super late to the game), so **forgive me if this post is too long or doesn’t obey some sort of Reddit norm that I don’t know about.** 

I was responding to a post in r/AdviceAnimals yesterday, and I found some of the reactions to my comment a bit odd. Based on the level of evidence I've read - I believe the 2024 election could have been stolen.

I was told that there’s *“no evidence”* that the 2024 election was stolen. That it’s all baseless. That it’s over, and that people questioning the results are anti-democratic. Pretty odd given the guy who occupies the White House still denies the last one. 

But here’s the thing: when you actually look at the data (unlike the last election where there really was no data to support any sort of fraud, and yes, I looked), public records, and even the statements made inside the White House after the election, a very different picture starts to form. I’m not saying this definitively proves the election was stolen, but if this isn’t at least worth investigating, then what is? 

I’ve tried to summarize the major facts so far as objectively as possible. Let me be very clear here: **I AM NOT A LIBERAL, BUT I DO DESPISE DONALD TRUMP AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY.**   
  
I consider myself a diehard centrist or even a radical independent. There are things I agree with Trump on, things I agree with Biden on, hell, I even agreed with SOME of RFK’s stuff on food additives and such. I really strive to look at every issue independently. Now, also to be clear, I despise Donald Trump because he is a low-quality human, he implements his ideas like a mobster in the 1970s and he's turned people into douches, BUT I’m trying not to let this bias impact my assessment. 

Let me lay out the evidence that at least warrants examinations of the cast vote records in all swing states and audit each of the ballot counting machines, including any software updates that could have been done before election day.

**1. Trump’s Own Statements**

On January 19, 2025, during a pre-inauguration rally in Washington, D.C., Donald Trump expressed gratitude towards Elon Musk for his support during the campaign, particularly in Pennsylvania. He stated: 

“He journeyed to Pennsylvania where he spent a month and a half campaigning for me… and he’s a popular guy. He knows those computers better than anybody. All those computers. Those vote-counting computers. And we ended up winning Pennsylvania like in a landslide.”  

Then during a FIFA World Cup announcement, Trump veered from soccer talk to politics when reflecting on how the United States secured hosting rights during his first administration. ""When we made this, it was made during my term, my first term, and it was so sad because I said, can you imagine, I'm not going to be President, and that's too bad,"" Trump said. ""And what happened is they rigged the election and I became President, so that was a good thing.""

Sure, Donald Trump is an idiot and says incoherent stuff all the time, but two incidents and one directly referencing the “vote-counting computers” do seem extremely fishy, especially given the work of the Election Truth Alliance or ETA.   
  
I’ve seen some Reddit posts criticizing these guys, but I’ve listened to the few videos they’ve produced, and they don’t have that same aura of bias that the election deniers from 2020 had. But again, this absolutely is circumstantial evidence at best – I think hearsay would be the appropriate classification, but these comments do and Trump's past statements about the 2020 election being rigged establish motive. 

**2. Clark County, NV**

Let’s move on to Nevada. The Election Truth Alliance analyzed the Cast Vote Records (CVR) from Clark County, raw voting machine data publicly available, and found multiple quantitative anomalies that demand answers.

*a. Drop-Off Voting Discrepancy:*

A “drop-off vote” is when someone votes for president but skips down-ballot races. This is normal, but here’s the twist:

• Trump had a +10.54% drop-off rate.

• Harris had just +1.07%.

That’s a 10X discrepancy. Why would Trump voters overwhelmingly skip Senate races but  
Harris voters didn’t? That’s not just odd, it’s statistically glaring and does not line up with past trends from other swing states. In fact, in Pennsylvania in 2024, the drop-off rate was around 5% for Republicans, and in 2012, during the Obama v. Romney campaign, the drop-off was 6% for republicans. In other words, **10% is wildly high.** 

*b. Early Voting Tabulator Anomalies:*

In early voting, the more ballots a tabulator processed, the more predictably skewed the results became:

• At tabulators with <250 ballots, Trump and Harris showed reasonable variance.

• **But above 250 ballots, results converged tightly around Trump 60%, Harris 40%, across the board.**

Human voting behavior doesn’t do that. You don’t get rigid clusters from tens of thousands of individual choices unless something artificial is influencing the result - perhaps a software update from some future DOGE employees? I don't know, but it certainly seems that Elon and his group of wunderkids have the means to do something like hack into counting machines or deploy a software update to them to manipulate them.

*c. Different Voting Methods = Different Realities:*

• Mail-in ballots: Trump got just 36%.

• Early voting machines: Trump got 59%.

• Election Day ballots: Trump at 50%.

How can such wild swings exist by the voting method alone? If you believe in clean elections, you have to ask, why would someone’s preference change that drastically based on how they vote? Again, circumstantial evidence here, but these do not line up with historical averages at all.

All this isn’t opinion. It’s right there in the official public CVR data. And we haven’t even gotten to Pennsylvania yet. Granted, it takes some time and will to really read through and understand this stuff – but my god, if something is worth your time, it’s making sure that who you vote for actually counts. If not, then it’s the entire ball game. 

**3. Pennsylvania**

Pennsylvania is where historical voting patterns were flipped on their head, and no one seems to be asking why.

Traditionally, urban centers like Philadelphia vote Democrat, and rural counties lean Republican, but in 2024, heavily Democrat precincts saw abnormally low turnout, while swing counties reported turnout higher than registered voter levels in some cases.

ETA flagged precincts where:

• Ballots cast exceeded 100% of registered voters.

• Votes for Trump outnumbered total ballots submitted, based on county reporting timelines.

• Tabulation errors were “corrected” days later with no audit trail.

Are these smoking guns? No. But they’re not normal either. And in any functioning democracy, these would be red flags triggering mandatory investigations, not media blackouts and certainly not blind ignorance or calling people who question the results, anti-democratic. 

Ask yourself this: if the exact same anomalies had helped Harris win, if he had unusually low drop-off rates, suspicious clustering in early voting machines, and skewed turnout in major cities, wouldn’t the media, Trump himself and half the country be screaming for investigations?

Wouldn’t Republicans be marching in the streets, demanding transparency? You know they would.

But somehow, when the data points in favour of their guy, suddenly, the response is, “Shut up, conspiracy theorist.” Unlike the 2020 election, there is a straightforward narrative you can paint, using data and logic, that is downright diabolical if it is true.

I strongly encourage folks to go have a look and read through the materials themselves. The one thing the Election Truth Alliance is doing is providing comprehensive documentation on their efforts, unlike many of the election deniers from 2020. 

And please, if you review this material and then say, “Hey, you’ve misinterpreted something,” – change my view, please, because this is truly exhausting.

1juj69e,CMV: They did NOT bring dire wolves back from extinction,"For those unfamiliar, there is a huge story right now about this biotech company that supposedly brought dire wolves back from extinction. They are claiming this to be the first ever ""de-extinct"" species

What they actually did was genetically modify a grey wolf. They used machine learning and AI to compare the DNA of a dire wolf to the DNA of a grey wolf, and then they genetically modified grey wolf DNA to make it more similar to a dire wolf. Apparently they made 20 edits to 14 genes to make this happen. 

First of all, I do think it's interesting and cool what they did, very impressive stuff. I've seen people dismissing this and acting like they did some random guesswork to what a dire wolf would have looked like and they then modified a grey wolf to look like what they think dire wolves looked like. Essentially glorified dog breeding. I'm not going that far, from my understanding they used a tooth and a bone from two different dire wolf fossils to actually understand the difference between dire wolf DNA and grey wolf DNA. In theory, if you edited the DNA of a chimpanzee (which is 99% similar to a human) to match the DNA of a human, then you could make a human being even if the source of DNA is technically that of a chimpanzee. Similarly, you could do the same with grey wolves and dire wolves. 

So maybe some day this company will get much more advanced and actually be able to genetically engineer extinct species in a way that actually makes them effectively the same species as an extinct species that died out thousands of years ago. But in the case of this dire wolf...yeah that ain't a dire wolf. Editing 14 genes of a grey wolf in my layman opinion is not enough to say that this isn't still just a grey wolf. I could be wrong about that so to any biologists reading this, please correct me if I'm wrong. But I would view this more to what a Yorkie is to a Doberman. They look different, but both are still dogs. 

I would guess that these supposedly de-extinct dire wolves might look similar to what dire wolves looked like (although we don't know exactly what they looked like), but I highly doubt it has the same behavior and thought processes. Like imagine if you genetically modified a gorilla to look like a human, but it still behaved and thought like a gorilla. Would that really be a human? 

**BONUS**

This is separate from the main CMV, but I would also add that this company is claiming to be doing this for the sake of biodiversity and bringing extinct species back into the ecosystem for the sake of fulfilling a specific role. I doubt that's actually the intention of this company. I bet this will more likely lead to ""extinct animal"" zoos (basically Jurassic Park), and probably in the long run the ability to genetically engineer humans.

1jvk879,CMV: The MAGA movement’s normalization of misinformation and distrust in facts is a growing threat to our future.,"I believe the consistent spread of misinformation within MAGA circles—and the refusal by many supporters to engage with credible sources—has become more than just a political divide. It’s setting a precedent where truth is subjective, and that’s incredibly dangerous.

What worries me most is that this trend isn’t stabilizing—it’s accelerating. People are not only doubling down on false claims after they’ve been thoroughly debunked, but they’re also building entire communities around those false beliefs. From election denial to anti-vaccine rhetoric, there’s a growing culture of mistrust that turns facts into “opinions” and disagreement into personal attacks.

This isn’t just frustrating—it’s a problem that’s compounding over time. Children are being raised in environments where critical thinking is discouraged and mainstream sources of information are dismissed out of hand. Social media bubbles reinforce these views, and alternative “news” ecosystems amplify them without accountability. We’re not just dealing with misinformed individuals—we’re watching the formation of a parallel reality, complete with its own heroes, villains, and narratives.

I recognize that misinformation exists across the political spectrum. But from what I’ve seen, the normalization and reinforcement of false narratives within the MAGA movement feels uniquely intense, widespread, and socially accepted in their circles.",seekinganswerslo,752,0.8399999737739563,385,1744242117,2025-04-09 18:41:57,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jvk879/cmv_the_maga_movements_normalization_of/,4,2025
1jvpmw6,CMV: The “gifted” programs in the early 2000s did more harm than good for most kids in them.,"I was part of a “gifted and talented” program in elementary and middle school during the late ’90s/early 2000s. At the time, it felt special — we got pulled out of class for enrichment activities, harder material, or independent projects. But looking back, I honestly think it screwed a lot of us up.

It gave kids a false sense of superiority without teaching real-world skills like effort, resilience, or how to fail. We were constantly praised for being “smart” rather than working hard, so when we eventually hit a wall (college, jobs, burnout), we didn’t know how to handle it. A lot of the kids I knew from gifted programs now struggle with anxiety, perfectionism, or a fear of mediocrity.

Meanwhile, it often created unnecessary separation from other students and didn’t actually prepare us for adult life — it just made us better at standardized tests.

I’m not saying all enrichment is bad, but I think the way gifted programs were handled back then set a lot of us up for emotional whiplash.

Change my view.

1jvw9br,CMV: If Trump engaged in insider trading that’s bad.,"Trump’s recent decisions to apply massive tariffs and then suddenly remove the tariffs caused huge swings in the stock market. Anyone with knowledge of the trade policies before they were enacted could make wild sums of money by buying stock market positions that predict how the market will react to the new policy. If Trump or his staff participated in insider trading, it would be corrupt and unethical.

The president of the United States holds one of the most powerful and influential positions in the world. With access to vast amounts of sensitive information and the ability to influence financial markets through policy decisions, the president is expected to uphold the highest ethical standards. If the president were to engage in insider trading—the practice of trading stocks or other securities based on non-public, material information you are entrusted not to use to your personal benefit—it would have severe consequences for the country’s integrity, economy, and public trust in government.

First and foremost, insider trading by the president would represent a gross abuse of power. The office of the president is entrusted with confidential information that, if used improperly, could unfairly benefit individuals or groups financially. Using that information for personal gain would be a betrayal of public trust and a violation of the duty to serve the nation’s interests above one’s own. The president is supposed to be a role model for lawful and ethical behavior. If the highest leader in the country engages in illegal financial activity, it sets a dangerous precedent for others in government and beyond.

Moreover, insider trading undermines the fairness and stability of financial markets. The stock market functions best when all participants have equal access to information. When someone, especially someone as powerful as the president, uses confidential knowledge to make financial decisions, it creates an uneven playing field. This can erode investor confidence and deter people from participating in the market, ultimately harming the economy.

Another major concern is the potential for corruption and manipulation. If a president benefits from insider trading, there may be a temptation to shape policies not based on the public good, but on what would increase personal wealth. For instance, the president could delay or push legislation in a way that benefits certain companies or industries they have investments in. This would erode democratic principles and lead to governance driven by profit, not the public’s welfare.

Finally, insider trading by the president would deal a serious blow to public trust in government institutions. Citizens expect transparency, accountability, and fairness from their leaders. If the president is seen as using their position for personal enrichment, it fosters cynicism, apathy, and resentment among the public. This can weaken civic engagement and faith in the democratic process.

Below are a few arguments I’d guess people may make against my claim. I’d be curious if there’s evidence for any of these or any other explanation for believing that it would be okay for Trump to engage in insider trading.

-Insider trading does not hurt anyone.

-If Trump can increase his wealth and power, that is good for the country even if some people lose out.",Guilty_Scar_730,740,0.8399999737739563,337,1744286748,2025-04-10 07:05:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jvw9br/cmv_if_trump_engaged_in_insider_trading_thats_bad/,4,2025
1jw3hht,CMV: Many Americans have no grasp on reality and it’s largely why we’re in this mess.,"I was talking to my boyfriend the other night about how Americans have become so soft. Now I’m not a conservative by a long shot, I’m very much on the left. But I was talking about how if the civil rights movement or the movement for women’s suffrage had happened today, those groups either wouldn’t have achieved their goals or it would have been *way more* difficult because people just seem so apathetic and uncaring.

This led me into saying that I really think a large majority of Americans have no real grasp on reality. Sure, if you’re in true poverty or are homeless in this country, that’s absolutely gonna suck and will be a horrible and traumatizing experience. However, most people who make an average salary are doing fine. Sure, you’ll probably need a roommate in more expensive areas and I do think that’s an issue, but still… even living with a roommate in an apartment is like… fine (at least to me).

Americans are so landlocked and separated away from any countries that experience *true and intense* hardships, that I really do believe we’ve come to the ideal that not being able to buy what you want all the time is the biggest hardship of all.

I think the amount of wealth that can be gained in this country really messes with people’s perception of what is normal. It’s normal to need a roommate, it’s normal to live in a smaller house, it’s normal to have to budget. But because we see people living extravagant lifestyles, we believe that somehow… through sheer force of will, we could also get there.

I also think it makes normal salaries that are fine amounts of money seem “small.” Like, I make 70k and I live in a large city in Missouri, but it’s really a mid sized city compared to others in the country. I live in a nice apartment building, can pay my rent and bills, and still buy and do things I want every once in a while. But somehow people have decided that 70-80k is still… not that much money?

I think Americans have been sold a lie that we can forgo social services in the name of being a country where you can *possibly, but probably not* make all the money you could ever dream of and more. If we had subsidized healthcare, parental leave, etc we probably wouldn’t feel the need to make over six figures, but people have decided that it’s more important to possibly be able to become a billionaire than to have services that would actually relieve stress and money issues.

Americans don’t want to admit that maybe they’ll be average for their whole lives and that is ruining us as a country.",MissHannahJ,5722,0.8999999761581421,587,1744305936,2025-04-10 12:25:36,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jw3hht/cmv_many_americans_have_no_grasp_on_reality_and/,4,2025
1jw9i2a,CMV: MAGA Republicans Get Triggered Just Much as Liberals Do,"Everyone loves saying "" Oh the left always gets triggered, facts over feelings"" etc. But in my opinion we live in a society where everyone gets triggered. Honestly MAGA republicans get triggered just as much as liberals do and don't get as much flak for it. I'll give two really great examples to prove my point. 

  
1. I recently saw an IG reel of a woman wearing a MAGA hat who walked into a gay bar where the bartenders were clearly trans. The second she walked in the bartender's told her to leave she was clearly upset by this and asked ""Why you don't want my money"" The bartenders said ""No it's because you're a Trump supporter"" this is something that very much upset her but they weren't having any of it. They said if she didn't leave that they'd call the police. Then the woman said that was discrimination LOL. First off, that's not discrimination because your political affiliation isn't a protected class, so let's just get that out of the way.

2. I saw a clip of Sam Seder ( A liberal commentator) on Patrick Bet David's podcast ( A known Trump supporter). PBD is honestly one of those pseudo intellectuals, it's crazy to me that people actually see him as a trusted news source considering how much misinformation he spreads. Anyways Sam Seder says exactly this on how PBD and his team spread misinformation on how illegal immigrants were getting social security benefits ( Not true btw legal, permanent resident green card holder's can get social security benefits, and can get a social security number. This is something that any green card holder can get) Anyways, Sam Seder says exactly that to PBD and his team, and they did what they always do whenever they get called out for spreading lies. They all just interrupted, spoke over, dismissed, and deflected everything Sam Seder said so much to the point that he really couldn't speak lol. It was pretty embarrassing to see these grown men have basically a toddler like melt down when they got called out for something wrong and couldn't even admit it. If this was any liberal doing the same thing these same people would clown them and be like "" Oh these liberals get so triggered""

The incredibly shallow thought process of: ""We should just have qualification-based hiring's"" is brain dead. We already hire off of merit, but are trying to give those who don't have an 'uncle in the business' a fighting chance. **Almost every high-paying professional work environment I've been in is 90%+ white.** To further this notion, labeling professionals/people who have worked hard to get where they are as 'DEI hires"" is horrible. 

**DEI is just a scape-goat for the Trump-alignment of his and his constituent's ideal white America.** The scrubbing of the Tuskegee Airmen and other Black/Hispanic/etc figures from government websites. The banning of books and reshaping of our school's education about slavery in America. The list goes on, all labeled as DEI. 

**Stiff-arming federal agencies, schools, and corporations with purposely vague notions of: 'Supporting DEI' to reshape/impose fear.** Meanwhile the threat of federal funds used as leverage. 

**America is on life support as the values that made this country great are torn to shreds**. Decades of collective action undone as our allies are spat on. 

Meanwhile women and those with disabilities fall under DEI.

Now no deal he signs will be precise and efficient enough to have manufacturing come ""roaring back"".

1jz4zpk,CMV: The culture war is functionally over and the conservatives won.,"I am the last person on earth who wants to believe this, and I feel utterly horrified and devastated, but I cannot convince myself that anything other than a massive shift towards conservative cultural views, extending to a significant extreme is in the cards across the anglosphere, and quite possibly beyond, and maybe lasting as long as our civlization persists.

Before last month, I wasn't sure, I thought that there could be a resurgence, a strong opposition at least, or failing that, balkanization into more progressive and more traditional societies.

Thing is, all of that hinged on one key premise: that this was completely ineffective on recruiting women, and that between the majority of women and minority of men still believing in institutuons and civil liberties recovery was possible. Then, I saw something, the sudden rise of Candace Owens in a celebrity gossip context. She now controls a lot of this narrative, and it's getting her views from women. SocialBlade indicates that about 10% of her 4 million subscribers therabouts came from the last month, and the pipeline is real. Her channel has shockingly recent content regarding a ""demonic agenda"" in popular music as well as moon landing conspiracy theories (to say nothing of the antisemitism and tradwifery I already knew was wrong with her). A lot of women may end up down the same pipeline as their male counterparts due to the front-end content, and it scares me.

Without as much opposition, I'm terrified of the next phase of our world. Even if genocide and hatred are averted, I fear in a few decades we'll have state-enforced religion, women banned outright from a lot of jobs, science supressed via destroying good research and data, a ban on styles of music marked 'satanic', and AI slop placating the populace and insisting it's how things ""should be"", and with algorithms feeding constant reinforcement, I don't see a path out of this state of affairs.

1jza96b,CMV: Donald Trump should be removed via Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution,"Section 4 of the 25th Amendment states:



""Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.



Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.""



I believe the President's Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office using this section. The 25th Amendment would also give cover to the Senate and the House to determine that the President is mentally incompetent, especially if there is evidence to support it. So it's safer for Congress to use this method instead of impeachment, because they can say that they support Trump, but that he ""lost his mental capacity.""



\*\*I think Congress would also be in their rights to hold votes through secret ballot as well, because they would like to protect their families from retaliation from an irrational President, who has shown a willingness to retaliate against anyone he perceives to be his enemy (\[see the attempted assassination of Nancy Pelosi by a supporter of his attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer in their home\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack\_on\_Paul\_Pelosi)), and who does not comply with the Rule of Law, or Due Process under the Constitution.\*\*



I think this would be a powerful argument because Trump's irrationality is self-evident through his own actions. For example, he is ignoring the advice of experienced experts in the government, he's instituting tariffs and rolling tariffs back, he's not following due process, and he's acting very irrationally. There is an unprecedented attack on our system of government, and there needs to be a determined and legally justifiable response to oust Trump, as soon as possible.



Through the 25th Amendment, the process would proceed as follows:







\- The VP and a majority of the Cabinet write a letter to the Senate President & House Speaker stating that Trump is not mentally competent, and the VP will assume the Presidency



\- Trump writes a letter back, stating that he is mentally competent, and attempts to take the power back



\- The VP & Cabinet write another letter stating that he is not mentally competent, and prevents him from taking the power back



\- The Senate and House must convene within 48 hours and rule by a 2/3 vote that Trump is or is not mentally competent within 21 days, this can be done by secret ballot for the safety of members of Congress







This is a historic moment, and I believe drastic steps need to take place to save our system of government. This is a legal method. :) People need to use their personal and institutional influence to lobby for this to happen, because our systems of government are under attack and we are at risk of losing everything.

Helping other dictators achieve their goals and stay in power, while also full throatedly supporting and praising them.

1jzxel2,CMV: MAGA and the new conservative movement that grew from Trump will fracture and die with him,"I don’t think the MAGA movement survives Donald Trump.

Not in the form it exists today, anyway. Trump didn’t just ride a wave of conservative populism, he became the wave. What we now call MAGA isn’t built on a platform or a coherent ideology. It’s built around a man. When he’s gone, politically, physically, or otherwise, I think what’s left will split, fracture, and ultimately lose most of the energy that made it so dominant.

The reason I say this is because, to me, MAGA is less of a movement and more of a cult of personality. Trump provided something the American far-right hadn’t had in a long time: a charismatic figurehead willing to be as loud, unfiltered, and combative as they are. He validated and amplified the angriest corners of the conservative base, the folks who for years felt ignored or dismissed by traditional Republicans. But I don’t see anyone else in his orbit who commands that same visceral loyalty. Ron DeSantis, JD Vance, Nikki Haley, they’re all trying to echo Trump’s style, but none have his draw. Without him at the center, the movement loses its gravitational pull.

I think we’ll see a power vacuum emerge when Trump is no longer politically viable. And history shows us that these types of vacuums rarely end with a smooth transfer of influence. Movements that are too centered on one figure often fall apart when that figure exits. Think of Ross Perot and the Reform Party, or even what happened to Perónism in Argentina after Juan Perón died. The infrastructure might remain, but the energy and direction falter.

I also think there’s a deep split coming, one that already exists beneath the surface, between the wealthy class of MAGA supporters and the working-class base. The rich Trump-aligned figures, the political insiders, donors, and media moguls, are in it because his presidency was good for their business or their access. They’ll move on and try to back whoever keeps the cash flowing or the tax breaks coming. But the working-class voters who saw Trump as their voice? I don’t think they ever really got what they wanted out of him. They got attention, but not much meaningful policy. Without Trump himself feeding that sense of rebellion and grievance, I suspect that wing of the movement will struggle to remain relevant, or at least unified.

So my view is that once Trump is gone, MAGA as we know it collapses. It might rebrand or morph into something else, but the current iteration will die without its central figure.

Change my view. I’m open to arguments that someone else could credibly take up the mantle, or that the ideology is strong enough on its own to outlive him. But to me, it feels like this movement lives and dies with Donald Trump.",superdino1234,1199,0.8500000238418579,303,1744737271,2025-04-15 12:14:31,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jzxel2/cmv_maga_and_the_new_conservative_movement_that/,4,2025

1k1bx02,CMV: We should have additional qualifications to be President of the United States beyond just being born here and over 35.,"The presidency is the most powerful position in the country, with massive influence over the economy, foreign policy, military decisions, and the overall direction of society. Yet the only requirements are being a natural-born citizen, at least 35 years old, and having lived in the U.S. for 14 years. That’s it.

We require immigrants to pass exams to become citizens. We expect doctors, lawyers, teachers—even hairstylists—to meet strict licensing and educational standards. But the person leading 330+ million people who also has an effect on the rest of the entire globe? No required knowledge of law, ethics, economics, history, or leadership. Nothing.

And on top of that, the system allows for billionaires and corporate donors to essentially manufacture a candidate’s rise through advertising, algorithm manipulation, and mass influence. Some even control voting infrastructure. A person doesn’t need to be competent—they just need to be loud, famous, and backed by the right people.

The Constitution is supposed to protect us from tyranny and instability. Shouldn’t that also mean protecting us from electing people who are clearly unqualified or emotionally volatile?

1k1ivtj,CMV: the American Left is too disorganized and decentralized to be of any use against MAGA,"There's an old saying about politics in America: when it comes to politicians, the Left has to fall in love, while the Right falls in line. It’s a huge generalization (the first of many I’ll make here), but there may be something to it.

The Left likes to mock MAGA for being idiots, but they have POTUS, 2/3 of SCOTUS, a congressional majority, and the world’s richest men who just so happen to control the most powerful media corporations. Who exactly is the party of idiots here?

This domination of government didn’t happen by chance; it’s the result of decades of careful planning by conservative organizations. The Right is excellent at branding; they come up with a bumper sticker slogan and they all stick to it relentlessly, regardless of how counterfactual it might be. Call them sheep, but they know how to organize.

The Left, on the other hand, is a circular firing squad ready to slaughter any of their own who don’t pass an ideological purity contest. (See the opposition for Biden/Harris on Gaza even when Trump made it abundantly clear he would bulldoze Gaza.). If the Right is a pack of wolves (or sheep) the Left is a pack of cats, utterly useless at organization.

The Left is great at theatrical protests, and terrible at actually getting anything done. Take the Tesla protests for example. Why would you film yourself throwing paint all over a Tesla dealership? You go to jail, possibly get slapped with domestic terrorism charges, and they wash the paint off the next day. It’s pure theater. 100% attack, 0% damage.

They could accomplish far more if they weren’t so focused on theatrical protests. Tere are only 160 Tesla stores in the US. It would be easy to find 160 individuals willing to sneak by in the dead of night with a squirt gun full of paint thinner and do far more damage without getting arrested, but that would require some degree of organization. \[\*NOTE: I'm absolutely 100% NOT advocating vandalism or any other criminal activity. I'm just pointing out that I’m an average schmuck with no activist credentials and it took me less than 30 seconds to come up with a solution that would be more economically devastating than what these feckless clickbait slacktivists have done.\*\]

Occupy Wall Street is another great example. It was very theatrical, and made for great TV, but what exactly did they stand for? What did they accomplish? There was no unified message, so it was too easy to divide and conquer, and the movement accomplished basically nothing.

The Right has been proactive and is very well organized. The Left is reactive and disorganized.

1k1od4a,CMV: Voting Republican today is a fundamentally inhumane act.,"Over the past several years, I've come to believe that the modern Republican party—and by extension, many who support it—actively vote against the wellbeing of vulnerable people. From policies on healthcare and education to the way marginalized communities are treated, I see a pattern of cruelty, apathy, and an unwillingness to engage with the broader impact of their votes.

This has led me to a cynical conclusion: Republican voters either don't care about others, lack the critical thinking to see the harm being done, or are simply echoing the beliefs of their social circles without deeper examination. I’ve struggled to see meaningful counterexamples, and I worry that “conservatism” today is less a philosophy and more a brand that people follow blindly.

I personally don't believe it's wrong other racist for them to prefer refugees and immigrants from Ukraine over Arabic and African ones f9r 3 reasons

1-Ukranians share similar cultures, values, politics, and religion with other Europeans countries unlike Arab and Africans so Ukranians integrate way easier in Europe than Arab and African ones due culture similarities.


2- Arab and African countries do the same thing to Ukranian refugees, not a single Arab or African nation took Ukranians as refugees, but many of these nations took other Arab and African refugees.


3-Companies prefer hiring immigrants from poor third world countries over hiring locals and immigrants from developed countries because of cheap labour which hurts the local population so it's natural for locals to oppose immigration from poor countries.

1k2w2c4,CMV: We are witnessing the end of Pax Americana in real time,"For context, I am not American and these are my views from the stance of a person living in a Western nation allied to America.

**1. The end of the American economic order**

Donald Trump's tariffs are from my POV, completely insane. Each of their stated goals are completely contradictory from each other, way too broad and universal to have any of the useless effects a properly though-out tariff policy would have, and target many of America's allies. Not only that, when Trump started the trade war with China, they completely crumbled against the pressure and exempted China's key hi-tech industries and are begging Xi Jinping to call the White House for a ""deal"". With bilateral trade basically not existing anymore, China can still source a lot of their US imports (which from what I gather are primarily agricultural products) from other countries, but America is screwed as they relied on China for a lot of renewable and computer tech. The dollar is weakening, and China is sitting on a ton of the USD reserves they can unleash to seriously damage America's ability to finance its debts.

I really don't want to be a doomer, but the US really seems to be in a precarious position. It seems like America wants to achieve autarky and isolate from the global market, but it seems like they are approaching it in the worst way imaginable as they are simultaneously weakening their's and their allies' positions while strengthening China's. We're not even past 100 days of Trump's presidency.

**2. End of the rule of law in America**

With Trump ignoring a Supreme Court order, the judiciary is left with no enforcement mechanism to make the executive comply. That just leaves the legislative branch as the final check through impeachment, but I very much doubt this will happen even if the Democrats sweep the midterms. The Trump administration is literally wiping their ass with established norms and the rule of law, and the worst part is that it seems that a sizeable portion of the American public is either ambivalent or supportive of this.

I won't go as far as to say that this will cause a civil war down the line, but I do believe that if this trajectory continues, then America is looking at an extremely turbulent period that I would imagine would be akin to the Years of Lead in Italy. Combined with the economic troubles that I mentioned earlier, it seems very likely for America to become even more insular, unstable, and even authoritarian.

**3. Geopolitical Instability**

America has completely abdicated any semblance of responsibility over being world police--case in point, Ukraine. Now, I very much recognise that the merits of being world police is a debatable topic, however, I think its just a fact that--irrespective of whether or not you think America has the moral duty to ensure a fledgeling democracy is not invaded by an imperialist power--I think that it just makes good geopolitical sense to ensure Ukraine wins or at least stalemates against a nation that is actively hostile to Western interests. The only conflicts that Trump is willing to take sides with seems to be countries that he has personal financial interests in (I think he has or at least wants to build a Trump tower in Moscow although I might be wrong on that and he definitely has assets in Israel for example).  
  
If, tomorrow, China declares war on Taiwan, it seems very unlikely for the US to lift a finger. All it takes is one direct encroachment into what used to be America's red line, and the world will find out that the America giant has fallen asleep again.

**Conclusion**

All in all, it is very hard for me to be optimistic about the longevity of American hegemony in the 21st century. I have personal gripes about America and the imposition of their will in my home countries' politics, however, I still do believe they are LEAGUES better than the alternative of China or Russia or any other nations in the ""axis of evil"". Trump has completely set alight the power of America--both soft and hard--for no apparent reason. He is not only dumb, in my view, but also weak. Even if you take the MAGA movement's purported goals at face value and agree that they are sound, they have achieved none of it. Best case scenario is that the current Trump presidency is just a bout of insanity that will take years to recover from. Worst case is that Trump has set alight a fuse to a bomb that will blow up in all of our faces some time in the future and end the American hegemony for better or worse.

1k2xt24,CMV: The Trump tariffs are intended to distract from the fact that the most sensible and effective way to reduce the U.S. national debt is to tax the rich,"The U.S. national debt is primarily influenced by the difference between government spending and tax revenue. Tax cuts generally increase the deficit. In fact, some studies show tax cuts by the Bush and Trump administration “have added $10 trillion to the debt since their enactment and are responsible for 57 percent of the increase in the debt ratio since 2001, and more than 90 percent of the increase in the debt ratio if the one-time costs of bills responding to COVID-19 and the Great Recession are excluded.” ([americanprogress.org](http://americanprogress.org))


I believe Trump is aware of the effect tax cuts have on the national debt. I believe he is firing federal workers and instituting tariffs as a scapegoat. He pretends those things will reduce the federal deficit; however, he knows they’re not a particularly effective way of doing so. It’s just that he prefers those things to taxing the rich.


The U.S. national debt sits at roughly $36 trillion. The top 1% of Americans are worth roughly $45 trillion. It stands to reason that raising taxes—especially as it relates to the top 1%—would be an effective way of reducing the federal deficit. Relative to instituting tariffs and firing federal workers, taxing the rich would likely raise more money and lead to lesser consequences for more American people. I believe Trump is aware of much of this, however, unlike most American people, Trump fears taxing the rich would more negatively affect him than tariffs and firing federal workers.

1k355md,"CMV: If a person is misled about someone’s age and engages in consensual sex with them, they shouldn’t be charged with any form of sexual assault or rape if they acted in good faith.","I want to present a perspective that I believe is often overlooked, and I’m curious to hear differing opinions.

Let’s say you’re a 21-year-old at a bar, a place where everyone is assumed to be of legal drinking age (21+). You meet someone there, they seem to be around your age, you flirt, and after some time, you both decide to hook up. Later, it turns out that the person you had sex with is underage — let’s say they used a fake ID or somehow misled you into believing they were of legal age.

In this situation, I don’t think the person who engaged in consensual sex should be charged with rape or sexual assault, assuming there was no malicious intent or clear signs of deception from their side. The individual who misrepresented their age is the one at fault, not the person who was misled.

Some points to consider:

Context matters: A bar is an adult venue, and the environment signals that all participants are of legal age. If someone enters that space and behaves like an adult, it’s reasonable to assume they are of age. There’s no obligation for a person to demand birth certificates or additional verification if everything else in the environment suggests they’re dealing with an adult.

Deception is the issue: The primary concern here is deception. If someone is underage and uses a fake ID or lies about their age, they are the ones responsible for the situation. It’s unreasonable to expect a person to be a mind reader and figure out someone's real age based on superficial details.

Personal responsibility: I understand the importance of personal responsibility, but in this case, the responsibility to verify should fall on the person who is actively lying about their age, not the one who is unknowingly misled. It’s not the person who acted in good faith based on the circumstances who should face criminal charges. It’s the one who created the false narrative.


I get that there are emotional and psychological impacts in situations like this, but I believe those impacts don’t justify criminalizing someone for acting based on the information they had at the time. In these cases, the law should focus on punishing the deceiver who used fraudulent means to mislead another person, not the person who was deceived.",ManasJain11,1305,0.8799999952316284,484,1745093430,2025-04-19 15:10:30,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k355md/cmv_if_a_person_is_misled_about_someones_age_and/,4,2025

1k43r3m,CMV: Citizens United was the worst thing to happen to the American political landscape,"Ever since the Citizens United v. FEC decision in 2010, I’ve felt like the integrity of American democracy has been steadily deteriorating. The ruling essentially said that corporations and other outside entities can spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections, under the banner of free speech. To me, that decision opened the floodgates to unchecked political spending, dark money, and disproportionate influence by the ultra-wealthy and powerful interest groups.

I believe this has led to:

	•	Unaccountable Super PACs spending billions with little transparency.

	•	Candidates beholden to donors, not voters, because campaigns are now insanely expensive when they likely wouldn’t be if Super PACs weren’t in bidding wars for ad time. Don’t even get me started on how some people in office can’t be bothered to attend a town hall with constituents. 

	•	Distorted public discourse, where those with the biggest megaphones (and more money than any reasonable coalition of voters could amass) shape the narrative.

	•	Widening political cynicism — many people feel like their vote or voice doesn’t matter when billionaires and corporations can outspend entire communities.

I’d love to hear opposing views, especially if you think the decision was the right one or has had unintended positive consequences.

1k5upf0,"CMV: Trump's tarrif war isn't stupidity or incompetence, he wants to tank the dollar.","1) Doge extracts 2+ trillion from the fed as a tax break for the rich. Meanwhile Trump and his inner circle are using his tarrif war to pump the economy for bill/trillion more (it's hard to know how much but they all start investing with 10-100s billions so they can get to trill faster than any of us). They're amassing capital. 
2)Trump said on day one he wanted to declare martial law, and signed EOs to get that ball rolling (something about immigrants). He cut USAID, farmers started posting videos about losing their farms because it was subsidizing many of them. He assaults immigrants,  farmers started  posting videos about not being able to run their farms. He enacted tarrifs and farmers posted videos about not being able to supply their farms. Farmers are losing their farms, that sounds like a food shortage this winter.  And that's just the kind of ""emergency "" Trump needs to declare that sweet, sweet  martial law. So he'll let it happen, who cares if the left calls him stupid for not seeing it coming.
3) They've been warning us for decades the dollar would fail, and in recent years sooner rather than later. Trump has antagonized Canada and Greenland with annexation, rewrote who was the aggressor in Ukraine and described the EU as designed to screw the US. No one trusts us. Noone wants to invest in us or buy our debt and they're starting to worry about using our currency, the default currency (or whatever it's called). Combine that with food shortages and unrest at home and that sounds to me like a recipe for how the dollar, already  struggling, finally fails.
4) At this point, with no currency, the US would  be bankrupt.  Banks get involved, you know, the banking system everyone loves and trusts and always have.  Can you think of anyone ( see point 1) who might, recently, have acquired the capital nessassary to pay the banks? Should an entity (maybe a real estate mogul) purchase the property south of Canada and north of Mexico it would become theirs. They wouldn't be any more beholden to the constitution than someone buying an abandoned factory is to the business that originally built it.  Trump, who operates his businesses this way, would then be free to reconstitute it as his personal corporate dictatorship (he said term 1 day 1 he wanted to be a dictator and has said he'd prefer to run the country like a business).  And while international law may have something to say about our fate, does Trump seem like someone who thinks he's answerable to the international community?

----I'm gonna wander a bit off topic here, this next bit is just for ""the lefties"". The above bit, though. I genuinely want you to change my view.----


If Trump (& the Heritage Foundation) is the wannabe tyrant it seems like he wants to be.
A) A ""food shortage"" is an effective way to hold an entire population down. I'd expect it to continue. Also, power and communications black outs, ""due to the food riots "". A good excuse to send troops after his enemies? Maybe relocate people to places ""he can supply food and power to"" (the US has done it before)? While he's saving us. I'd figure communications would return quickly enough, but only things propaganda compatible would be allowed. (I'm thinking about how they say TV is in China, N Korea, etc)

B) The mid terms will be too late. What few patriots are left in government need to know  if they move to incarcerate Trump and the heritage foundation loyalist we will be there in large enough number to prevent another Jan 6. They can't act if we aren't there to protect them and prove, once and for all, that trump's will isn't the will of the patriotic United States of America! 

Time is running out. We all have to come out. This isn't politics as usual. This year we may well decide if self governance was too hard. If we fundamentally believe in freedom, liberty and happiness for all, or if we feel like the great American experiment was a failure. It wasn't. call every elected and appointed official you can as offen as you can and TELL THEM! Show up at every protest you can. Go to your town halls. Ask the 60's, it works!

For any ""righties"" who made it this far, if you believe in the constitutional USA (and I think, deep down, even the angriest of you do), I hope you guys understand everyone over here is just worried the same corporations that corrupted our (our) system of government are finally making their move.  It's not really about Trump specifically,  we just think he's in on it. We may disagree about things, but in this system we each get to celebrate our sides victories or plan to win the other side over next time. The greatest victory is converting your opponent. And for the petty among us all, you get to poke at the other side like an a.. and no one  can really stop you.( But if you start it they can preach back at you, fairs fair, ;) )

1kazuo6,CMV: The liberal focus on nonviolent protests betrays the fact that most of the successful nonviolent movements existed alongside the implicit or explicit threat of violence,"Note to the admins: This is absolutely not a call to violence. Just an observation.

Anybody who has been to a protest in the US knows that the organizers take great efforts to ensure protests remain nonviolent. There are usually speeches, shouting, marching, etc. I've never been to an organized protest where the organizers did not take great care that we remained civil. The thing is, online and in liberal community projects, there's always the idea of nonviolent resistance held up as a golden standard by which we all abide.

My point of view comes from a few observations:

The first is that our protests lately seem to not be working. There's a rising tide of fascism in the US marked by the erosion of the institutions of democracy, threats to the judiciary, the politicization of civil service, and threats to the free press. Despite the protesting, we've had near-zero effect on public policy.

The second is that historical ""non-violent"" movements were always accompanied by implicit or explicit threat of violence. The US Civil Rights movement was widely known to be non-violent, however it existed alongside more violent groups like the Black Panthers and others. These protests gained moral authority and effectiveness partly because they existed alongside more militant alternatives that made peaceful change seem like the preferable option to those in power.

Other examples would include:

* Suffrage, with women in the movement who murdered opposition, did arson and property damage, and set off bombs
* The US Labor Movement in the early 1900s, where unions would destroy factories and kill the owners on occasion, to gain rights
* The Stonewall Uprising, where trans women threw bricks at police and shifted the movement from primarily accommodationist tactics to more assertive demands for rights
* In South Africa, after the Sharpeville massacre of 1960, the African National Congress formed an armed wing (Umkhonto we Sizwe) while continuing other forms of resistance. Nelson Mandela later acknowledged that this multi-faceted approach was strategically necessary given the context.

Basically I'm saying that nonviolence has historically not always been the answer. I think liberals tend to whitewash the truth to make it more acceptable to the average person, rather than discuss the true history behind some of these movements. I think they've sort of blindly accepted nonviolence as the only solution to an authoritarian uprising in the US and it's not getting them anywhere.

And even if you go in with intention of ignoring any political comments when you're listening to or watching someone for hours each week then their views will begin to influence you whether you realise it or not.

A friend recently showed me a few episodes of the John Oliver show and while I found it interesting I kept getting pulled out of it by long, drawn out monologues about how horny he is for horses, or how much he wants to sexually assault star wars actor Adam Driver, or even multiple jokes about how scary making phone calls is. Needless to say but for your typical tradie scared of phone ringing is not relatable humour.

I don't think people realise the gap in culture between inner city office workers and more rural trades people, even little jokes that pop up constantly in modern entertainment like ""if you're part of generation ... you'll never own a house"" or ""if you're under 30 you don't have to pay attention because our next piece is about home ownership"". Most of my mates are in their 20's and already own homes so even these types of comments create a sense of unrelatability.

1kbowjo,CMV: The MAGA hat is the modern equivalent of a Nazi-era swastika armband,"Now, to be clear, I'm not claiming that MAGA supporters are Nazis, or that the U.S. today is equivalent to 1930s Germany.  But I am arguing that the MAGA hat serves a similar *s*ocial function to the swastika armband during the Nazi rise to power.  Both are symbols worn in public to signal loyalty to a political movement grounded in nationalism, identity politics, and authoritarian leadership.

[Research shows that political symbols shape group identity and public perception](https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/8/6/50).  The swastika armband marked allegiance to an ideology that promoted ethnic superiority and rejected democratic norms.  The MAGA hat, while originally a campaign slogan, has become strongly associated with anti-immigrant sentiment, misinformation, and efforts to undermine democratic elections.  [FBI data shows that hate crimes rose significantly after Trump’s 2016 election. ](https://www.newsweek.com/hate-crimes-under-trump-surged-nearly-20-percent-says-fbi-report-1547870) Studies from [Pew ](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/07/18/americans-say-the-nations-political-debate-has-grown-more-toxic-and-heated-rhetoric-could-lead-to-violence/)and [SPLC ](https://www.splcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/yih_2020_final.pdf)(Southern Poverty Law Center) indicate that MAGA-drive aggressive language by politicians makes violence more likely, correlating with spikes in xenophobia and political violence.

While the MAGA hat doesn’t carry the same historical weight or scale of atrocity, it increasingly functions as a marker of political tribalism and fear for marginalized groups.  Like the armband, it defines an “us” and a “them.”

1kbrkch,CMV: The United States would be a more just and united country today if the Union had imposed draconian punishments on the Confederacy after the Civil War,"This is a follow-up/enhancement to a recent post on this subreddit titled ""CMV: The American Civil War should have ended with mass executions"".  I thought that post was a good start, but I wanted to take the idea even further.  
  
The failure of the Union to decisively dismantle Confederate ideology and power structures after the Civil War was a critical mistake that enabled white supremacist terrorism and regional grievance culture to persist for generations. If the Union had treated the Confederacy as a treasonous insurrection and responded with uncompromising punishment—including executions of leadership, long-term military occupation, land redistribution, and the criminalization of Confederate symbols—then I believe the United States would today be a more socially just, racially equal, and politically united country.

**Context**:  
After the Civil War, the federal government pursued a relatively lenient policy toward the defeated South. Confederate leaders were not executed; many quickly regained political influence. Efforts to protect the rights of freed slaves during Reconstruction were eventually abandoned. This led to the rise of the ""Lost Cause"" mythology, the creation of Jim Crow laws, and racial terror groups like the KKK. Confederate monuments were erected decades later, and even today, states fly Confederate flags and debate whether the Civil War was ""about states' rights.""

I think all of this could have been prevented—or at least severely limited—if the federal government had acted more decisively in the 1860s and 70s.

**My Argument**:

If the Union had enacted a policy of **total dismantling** of the Confederacy—not just in terms of military defeat, but cultural, political, and economic erasure—the following benefits would likely have emerged:

1. **Abolition of Confederate Identity**:
   * Confederate leaders like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee could have been publicly tried and executed for treason.
   * Confederate flags, monuments, and songs could have been banned by federal law.
   * Southern schools and churches would be required to teach a pro-Union, anti-slavery narrative—preventing the Lost Cause myth from ever taking root.
2. **Lasting Protection of Black Civil Rights**:
   * A prolonged military occupation (20–30 years) could have kept Black voters, landowners, and politicians safe.
   * Land formerly owned by slaveholders could have been redistributed to freedmen.
   * A Black political class might have firmly taken root, with long-term representation at all levels of government.
3. **Economic Restructuring**:
   * Plantation landowners could have been dispossessed and barred from regaining political or economic power.
   * Northern industry and capital could have modernized the South with infrastructure and industry under federal control.
   * The region’s economy might have been diversified away from white-dominated agriculture much earlier.
4. **Suppression of White Supremacist Movements**:
   * Early iterations of the KKK and similar groups could have been ruthlessly dismantled by federal troops with legal authority.
   * Sympathy for such groups would be viewed socially and legally as treasonous rather than defensible under ""heritage.""
5. **Long-Term National Unity**:
   * The regional divide that still influences U.S. politics might have faded with a clearer victory and forced ideological realignment.
   * Racial grievance and Southern exceptionalism would be stigmatized and discredited early.

**Anticipated Counterarguments** (feel free to challenge these):

* “That level of punishment would’ve caused long-term insurgency.” → Possibly, but the South was already devastated; firm occupation could have prevented armed uprisings more effectively than leniency did.
* “You can’t force ideological change through punishment.” → Post-WWII Germany and Japan suggest otherwise—firm restructuring paired with education and democratization *can* work.
* “That would’ve been authoritarian and un-American.” → The Confederacy waged war to preserve slavery. The response needed to be just as morally clear and uncompromising.

**Change My View**:  
I'm open to hearing why this path would not have led to a better America. Would it have backfired long-term? Are there moral or practical limits to federal authority, even in the wake of treason? Would another approach have been more effective?

Let me know—I'd especially appreciate well-sourced historical, legal, or ethical arguments.",Vidarr2000,1431,0.8100000023841858,321,1746047590,2025-04-30 16:13:10,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kbrkch/cmv_the_united_states_would_be_a_more_just_and/,4,2025
1kcxb89,CMV: It takes more faith in Paul to believe in modern Christianity than in Jesus,"When I read the Gospels, Jesus appears as a Jewish teacher preaching repentance, Torah observance, and the coming Kingdom of God. His message was specific, grounded in Jewish law, and aimed at a Jewish audience. There’s no Trinity, no salvation by faith alone, and no outright dismissal of the Law. But then Paul enters the picture, someone who never met Jesus in life and who redefines the entire framework.

Paul’s writings pivot from Jesus’ teachings to doctrines like grace over law, justification by faith, and a divine Christ figure who replaces obedience with belief. It’s Paul who opens the door to Gentiles and pushes a theology that would be unrecognizable to most first-century Jews. Today’s Christianity, especially in its Protestant forms, leans more on Paul’s interpretation than on Jesus’ own words.

To me, believing in modern Christianity requires trusting Paul’s authority and vision more than Jesus’ teachings. That doesn’t sit right with me. I’m open to being challenged on this, but I don’t think the historical Jesus ever intended the religion that bears his name to become what it is now.

1kd3inn,CMV: The Allies were right to drop the nuclear bombs on Japan at the end of WWII,"The Allies decided to drop two nuclear bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in order to try and force Japan to surrender and therefore end WWI. My view is that this was morally the right decision, admittedly an incredibly difficult decision, but the right one. I do not believe nuclear bombs are the answer in basically any situation. I am not debating whether they should exist or be used in the future, just in this particular instance.

If we look purely at estimated death figures, on the high end there are 246,000 deaths from the 2 nuclear bombs (yes I understand many more lives will have been implicated), compared to estimations in the millions on BOTH sides (Allies and Japanese) for a land invasion of Japan. I understand the dangers of a utilitarian perspective, but if we look purely at the numbers they are not even comparable. A quarter of a million compared to multiple millions, when by this point of the conflict an estimated 70-85 million people had already died. I cannot begrudge the Allies for wanting to reduce the overall death toll, and the best way to do that was to end the war as quickly as possible, and in this case that meant using nuclear weapons.

I think in arguments against this, many people also misunderstand the Japanese point of view. Not only were they almost entirely set against surrendering, there was very little structure within the upper echelons of Japanese government/military. We can see this from the Tokyo War Crime Trials, where they all basically refuse to answer questions, claim they didn't have authority over anything, and someone else was in charge. Whilst this does show general chaos of wartime command, it also explains the lack of accountability taken by many of the Japanese following WWII. We can also see how badly some of the Japanese did not want to surrender even after the two bombs were dropped, as there was an attempted coup by some army officers to prevent Hirothi's broadcast accepting defeat. In this speech, the lack of accountability can be seen, as Hirothi claimed there was no intention to ""infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to embark on territorial aggrandisement"" which is just a blatant lie. As recently as 2015, conservative voices in Japan have lobbied Japanese Prime Ministers to reflect that Japans actions were not aggressive or illegitimate. I understand this reflects a minuscule portion of the country, and am by no means saying that Japan is not sorry for the crimes they committed, but it is concerning that this view is still circling around government circles.

There are also the environmental impacts to consider. Mainly the consequences caused by radiation. However, the radiation created from nuclear bomb testing is greater than that created from these two bombs. I understand that those tests were not done on densely populated areas, so the effects of these two will remain greater. I will admit that this is the weakest point of my argument, as there are clear environmental impacts. I just believe the overall lower death toll is of greater significance than the environmental impacts that occurred.

I am willing to change my view on this. Have I underestimated the environmental impact? Do you think even with the lower death toll dropping the nuclear bombs was still morally wrong? If so, why? Again, I am not debating the existence of nuclear bombs, just when they were used to end WWII.

  
EDIT: Thank you everyone for your contributions, I am pleased to say my mind has mostly been changed on this issue. Thank you for mostly a pleasant and intriguing discussion. I posted this as I wanted to have my view challenged, and your contributions have been very helpful. I have tried to respond to and engage with as many of you as possible. I have awarded multiple deltas to people that have brought new things to my attention, or have convinced me that things were more important than I had given them credit for. In no particular order I will list below factors behind my change in view. 

1. 3 days between the two bombs was not long enough 

2. I underestimated the impact of the Soviets, and the effect they had on a potential Japanese surrender, in light of this, the bombs were less necessary 

3. US being unreasonable by demanding unconditional surrender. Whilst I may understand the potential logic behind this, I had not given adequate thought as to how this would've affected Japan's willingness to surrender 

4. Other motivations behind dropping the bombs, aka a dick swinging contest with the Soviets 

5. Bombs or land invasion were not the only two options. There were other options, every options had their drawback but this was not a binary choice as I had originally presented it

6. The bombs could've been dropped on unpopulated areas/military targets 

These are all valid points, and thank you for bringing them to my attention. I will now no longer be responding to comments.

1keqtit,CMV: it’s perfectly reasonable to drop friends over political views,"I’ll start by clarifying that I’m a leftist, and that will inform a lot of the examples I use, but I don’t think you need to be a leftist to agree with me here. 
Lots of people, admittedly less these days, talk about how silly it is to stop being friends with someone or dislike someone over their political views. I don’t agree. People who say this act as if politics are some given trait or private matter like religion or culture, when it’s inherently not. Especially in a democratic country, a person’s political views have an impact on the society they are a part of. Yes, people inherit their beliefs from their family or whatever sometimes, but ultimately political views are rarely arbitrary, people tend to have reasoning to support theirs. I want to exclude from this people who clearly haven’t critically engaged with their views or politics. If you grew up in a republican household for example, and you study engineering and kind of just follow headlines, you aren’t really responsible for those views. Also, I mean this more for close friends. If you run in the same circles as someone you disagree with, there’s no reason to make an issue of it if they’re not someone you’re close with, trust, or love, ect.  
I’m not just talking about hateful or extreme views though, like thinking that gay people are sinful or supporting the deportation of green card holders for expressing their beliefs. Even basic beliefs about tax structure, regulations, or welfare. Just because those aren’t as flashy/provocative, doesn’t make them unimportant (they are often more impactful and broad in reach even). Like I said, I’m generally a leftist. If you are a “moderate” or believe in fiscal/macroeconomic policy that maintains the status quo, I think I should be totally justified in having a problem with that. 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and you believe that’s okay? Thats your right, but to me it shows we don’t have the same values (even ethically speaking) and I don’t want to have a close relationship with you. 
Let’s say you’re right libertarian leaning, and you think a too powerful state poses an existential risk, or maybe you think property is a god given right and wealth redistribution violates natural law or something (sorry if this sounds like a straw man for the right, that’s not my point though. If your friend believes in lots of regulation and democratic socialism, I think you have a good reason not to want to be close friends with them. 
Look, I’m not saying you should do this. I have lots of friends I disagree with about this stuff and I’m willing to look past it. I just think politics are a legitimate reason to end or loosen a relationship with someone.

1ker8rp,CMV: The starvation of Gaza is inhumane and constitutes genocide,"Israel has not allowed aid trucks into Gaza since they broke the ceasefire in late March. As a result, the people there have no food. The argument stating that ""you cannot supply your enemy during wartime"" does not apply here because Israel occupies the territory. As the occupier, it has the responsibility of the well-being of the people there.

In the future, MANY Palestinians, especially children, will die. This is an intentional wiping out of a population. If Israel can conduct precise strikes in Lebanon, why not Gaza? Why insist on destroying all of Gaza? All of its universities, hospitals, and most of the residential neighborhoods. 

Israel will most likely become an even great pariah. Honestly, it will be well-deserved. On the contrary, why would they want that if they want to normalize?

As for ""protecting itself against terrorism,"" a lot of Gazans will be radicalized by these measures. This move will make Israeli civilians less safe. Honestly, I do not see the logic.

1kfaxhw,CMV: Arab countries are pretty terrible at protecting their religious and ethnic minorities.,"Whether they are a religious or ethnic minority group, minorities are persecuted and treated as worse than second class citizens. 

The biggest example of the Jews, they were always treated badly in Arab countries, even before Israel existed like Farhud massacre in Iraq (1941) and Hebron massacre (1834), in fact half of Israel population is Mizrahi Jews (MENA Jews) who fled their countries because of Arabs persecuting. There barely any jews left in Arab world while other Muslims nations like Turkey (15k Jews) and Iran (10k Jews) still have thousands of Jews living there. 


Same thing with Christians, Israel is the only MENA country with growning Christian population, attacks against Christians are big problem in Arabic world, there always a news about Christian being killed there and church being bombed. Even under secular Arab regimes like Saddam and Assad, Assyrian names were banned and speaking in Aramaic was discouraged. Coptic language (the native langauge of Egypt) has no native speakers and only used in praying. Amazigh langauges (indigenous langauges of North Africa) are all endangered and some of them got extinct, Libya even banned speaking them under Gaddafi. 


Kurds despite being Muslims are also heavily discriminated in Syria and Iraq, they have been massacre against Kurds (also Assyrians) by Arabs from over century like the Anfal genocide in iraq where 200k Kurdish civlians have been killed. Kurdish langauge and culture (like Newroz holiday) have been oppressed in Iraq and Syria since 60s and there are over 300k Kurds in Syria whom are still stateless to this day.


Since the fall of Assad, Alawites have victim of genocides where many alawite dozens were fullly ethnic cleansed leaving no alawites left and over 31k alawites took refuge in Lebanon and the number is still gorwimg every day. Druze also are persecuted there have been dozens of attacks against them since Assad fall of and they have even called for autonomous region in Syria and support from Israel because they don't trust Sunni Arabs to protect them, same thing in Israel, Israeli duze are very pro-Israel because Palestinians used to persecute them before Israel existed.

1kfljdk,CMV: Waiving inspection in the purchase of a home as a bargaining chip should be illegal,"Over the past few years I've been attempting to buy a home, and on multiple occasions now I've lost out to somebody who waived their right to a home inspection.

In these cases, my offers have been solid.  I've offered 20% down, have good credit, and in some cases have gone over asking with my offer. It doesn't matter.  The offer with waived home inspection always wins, and I'm not willing to give this up.

But this got me thinking... It seems like, if a buyer can waive a home inspection and people are willing to do that as a concession, then nobody gets to have a home inspection. All buyers are eventually going to be forced to waive it to compete if they want any home at all.  

This opens all buyers up to the risks of buying a house without an inspection: potential structural issues, electrical issues, water intrusion issues, etc, that will be so expensive to fix that they may result in bankruptcy, with no way of knowing ahead of time what you're walking into.  That's an insane way to live.

Any current owner/seller, even the ones who don't think there's any major issue with the house they're selling, would be morons to not push that risk onto the buyer if they can get away with it.  It basically absolves them of their duty as homeowners to maintain their own property and makes it somebody else's problem.  In fact, if they know they're going to get an offer from somebody who waives inspection, it practically invites them to defer maintenance!  Why fix it right if you can sell the house and make it somebody else's problem?

Legality aside, I'm honestly not sure why mortgage companies allow it in their terms, since it puts the loan at risk if the buyer immediately becomes upside down and declares bankruptcy due to the need for major remediation.

And none of this is a case of ""if somebody's stupid enough to do that it's on them"" because it's such a juicy plum for the seller that it forces the whole market down into the mud to compete. Once we're there, there may as well not be any home inspections at all.  

If you want any buyers to be able to do preliminary home inspections, they needs to be a legal requirement.

1kfok4r,CMV: The US should not be supporting Israel.,"**I am going to make this case purely off of how Israel has acted towards the West, and NOT their war crimes in the Gaza strip or occupation zones or anything like that.**

This is for 2 reasons:

1. because many Western readers may not be as concerned with the Palestine issue (understandable, as it doesn't directly affect their daily lives as much as the climate crisis or social issues),
2. and because Israel often claims that the ICC and the rest of the world courts are biased against Israel, so we'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they're correct and aren't committing even a single crime against Palestinians.

so I will try to make the case that Israel's violations **towards Western powers alone** should be the reason we cut funding to that country.

* Israel [does not honor US sanctions on Russia](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/netanyahu-governments-approach-russia-and-ukraine) in response to the Ukraine invasion, making it the only US ally to do so.

* Not only that, they go even further and demand the US allows [Russia to be able to keep their military bases in Syria](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-lobbies-us-keep-russian-bases-weak-syria-sources-say-2025-02-28/) following the deposition of Omar al-Bashir.

If someone comes to your door right now, and says: ""Hi, we would like you to sign our petition. Right now you can send USD 4 billion of aid to Israel, it'll just go on the deficit and US taxpayers will have their taxes increased to cover the cost.""

Trump himself has also brought it up repeatedly but says he's joking (or not).  I think the objective of this is to get his opponents focused on it, force them to expend time and effort fighting the possibility of a third Trump term, when all along Trump and his toadies are working on a separate plan, which is this: when people start rioting in the streets because they can't get basic essentials, or possibly because of other issues, Trump will send in the National Guard. He can use heavy handed enforcement tactics to force violent encounters; shootings, assaults, riots, etc. At that point he declares martial law, claiming he's just trying to keep the peace.  Then he can suspend due process and start rounding up protesters and throwing them in camps (a 1,400 acre detention center is currently being planned for Texas). He can also arrest any politicians who oppose him.  As the situation becomes more tense Trump will claim he has no option but to suspend elections until things cool down, making him president indefinitely.

1kgt7ag,"CMV: Western societies need to tolerate Islam less, not more.","This is specifically about Islam. I’m generally at odds with organized religion as a whole but among them, Islam stands out as the most ideologically aggressive, violent, and resistant to criticism. Christian or Jewish extremism exists, yes ,but there are levels to this. The scale, frequency, and institutional nature of violence or repression justified through Islamic teachings far surpass what we see from other faiths today.

And yet in Western societies, Islam is treated with extreme caution. Any open criticism is met with accusations of bigotry, and in some cases, violent threats and action. This creates a chilling effect where people self-censor not because they’re wrong, but because they’re afraid. That’s not tolerance, it’s submission.

I believe we should take concrete steps to reduce Islam’s ideological presence in the West:

**Restrict immigration** from Muslim-majority countries where this ideology is deeply embedded.

**Ban mosques** not because every single one is a threat, but because Islam doesn’t just use mosques for prayer. They often function as ideological centers where teachings can cross the line into political and social indoctrination. The potential for radicalization is built into the model. We don’t need structures that act as ideological distribution points for a system fundamentally at odds with our values.

**Protect speech critical of Islam** just as fiercely as we protect any other form of dissent. The current climate of fear is unacceptable in any society that values open discourse.

This is not about persecuting individuals. It’s about treating Islam the way we would treat any ideology that undermines liberal democratic values. We don’t tolerate Nazism. We don’t tolerate theocracy. So why does Islam, in its political and doctrinal form, get special treatment?

1kh09qd,"CMV: The global outrage over some civilian deaths while ignoring others reveals selective morality, not true empathy.","I believe the world shows selective outrage when it comes to civilian casualties in conflict zones. When children die in Gaza or Ukraine, there's a global outpouring of sympathy, hashtags, media coverage, and activism. But when Indian civilians or soldiers are killed in terrorist attacks like Pulwama, Uri, or 26/11 the same energy is almost never seen.

It feels like empathy is being filtered through political trends. If you're aligned with what's seen as the ""popular"" or ""correct"" cause, your grief is validated. But if you're from a country like India and your attackers are tied to state-sponsored terrorism from Pakistan, suddenly it's seen as ""complicated,"" and global sympathy becomes muted or absent.

I'm not saying we shouldn’t care about innocents in other countries we absolutely should. But I question why grief and outrage seem so inconsistent. If terrorism is wrong, it should be wrong no matter who the victims are. And if dead children are a tragedy, then that truth should be universal not selective.

You can't agree with just 90% of the issue, if you don't agree with that remaining 10%, you're labeled a something-phobe and considered a target for cancellation. Obviously the right makes use of this, because it's really easy to point out how extremist that group is being. What were otherwise average people just end up voting against the group that attacks them.

One really good example of this is Reddit. This website censors a lot of social/cultural debate that's not biased towards the left. It's why a lot of topics are banned on a variety of subreddits.

1ki79g9,"CMV: Universities are not making students liberal. The ""blame"" belongs with conservative culture downplaying the importance of higher education.","If you want to prove that Universities are somehow *making* students liberal, the best way to demonstrate that would be to measure the political alignment of Freshmen, then measure the political alignment of Seniors, and see if those alignments shifted at all over the course of their collegiate career. THAT is the most definitive evidence to suggest that Universities are somehow spreading ""leftist"" or ""left-wing"" ideology of some kind. And to my knowledge, this shift is not observed anywhere.

But yeah, ultimately this take that Universities are shifting students to the left has always kind of mystified me. Granted, I went to undergrad for engineering school, but between being taught how to evaluate a triple integral, how to calculate the stress in a steel beam, how to report the temperature at (x,y,z) with a heat source 10 inches away, I guess I must have missed where my ""liberal indoctrination"" must have occurred. A pretty similar story could be told for all sorts of other professions. And the only fields of study that are decidedly liberal are probably pursued largely by people who made up their minds on what they wanted to study well before they even started at their University.

Simply put, never have I met a new college freshman who was decidedly conservative in his politics, took some courses at his university, and then abandoned his conservatism and became a liberal shill by the time he graduated. I can't think of a single person I met in college who went through something like that. Every conservative I met in college, he was still a conservative when we graduated, and every liberal I met, he was still liberal when we graduated. Anecdotal, sure, but I sure as hell never saw any of this.

But there is indeed an undeniable disdain for education amongst conservatives. At the very least, the push to excel academically is largely absent in conservative spheres. There's a lot more emphasis on real world stuff, on ""practical"" skills. There's little encouragement to be a straight-A student; the thought process otherwise seems to be that if a teacher is giving a poor grade to a student, it's because that teacher is some biased liberal shill or whatever the fuck. I just don't see conservative culture promoting academic excellence, at least not nearly on the level that you might see in liberal culture. Thus, as a result, conservatives just do not perform as well academically and have far less interest in post-secondary education, which means that more liberals enroll at colleges, which then gives people the false impression that colleges are FORGING students into liberals with their left-wing communist indoctrination or whatever the hell it is they are accused of. People are being misled just by looking at the political alignment of students in a vacuum and not considering the real circumstances that led to that distribution of political beliefs. I think it starts with conservative culture.

1klmg7r,CMV: President Trump should not accept the 400 million dollar jet from Qatar.,"Donald Trump should not accept the $400 million Boeing 747-8 jet gifted to him by the Qatari royal family. This decision is not merely controversial—it is unethical, unconstitutional, and a blatant affront to the very ideals of American sovereignty and integrity. 

Qatar has long been implicated in funding terrorism, with Trump himself acknowledging in 2017, “The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.” It has provided millions in direct aid to Hamas, hosted its leaders in Doha, and turned a blind eye to known terrorist financiers operating within its borders. Reports have linked Qatari charities to funding al-Qaeda, and wealthy donors from the country have bankrolled Taliban operations. Despite passing counterterrorism laws, Qatar continues to shelter extremists, making Trump’s acceptance of its gift not just unethical, but a serious security risk.

This jet is not a gesture of goodwill—it’s a bribe. Qatar is known for using its wealth to influence leaders who might serve its agenda. The idea that this plane is simply a donation to the United States is absurd. It will eventually be handed over to Trump’s presidential library, meaning it will become a personal asset. No matter how the administration tries to spin it, Qatar is giving Trump something of immense value, knowing it could influence his decisions in the future. 

Beyond ethics, this arrangement directly violates the U.S. Constitution. The Emoluments Clause explicitly forbids government officials from accepting gifts from foreign states. The distinction between gifting the aircraft to the Defense Department first and later passing it to Trump does not change the fundamental issue. Richard Briffault, a government ethics specialist, has noted that once the aircraft is transferred to Trump’s presidential library, it ceases to be a gift to the United States and becomes personal property. No matter how the administration attempts to justify this exchange, it remains a clear-cut example of unconstitutional foreign influence.

This move also contradicts everything Trump has claimed about putting “America First.” He has spent years criticizing foreign governments for exerting influence in U.S. politics. He once attacked Hillary Clinton for accepting money from Qatar (a one million dollar donation to the Clinton Foundation to celebrate Bill Clintons 65th birthday), yet now, he is gladly taking a gift worth $400 million from the same government. His company has also just announced plans for a luxury golf resort in the country. So is this decision based on America’s best interests or his own business ventures?

If Trump proceeds with accepting Qatar’s gift, he does so at the cost of American integrity, transparency, and security.

Not a single one of my policy views align with his except the fact that NATO member states are acting in bad faith and need to face consequences if they do not comply with their commitments. 

While not binding, NATO member states have made formal commitments to spend at least 2% of their annual GDP on national defence. Given escalating tensions globally now (e.g., Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, Russia and Ukraine), it has become more important than ever for NATO allies to stand together in case things cascade into full-scale war. Unfortunately, many NATO member states seem to be free-riding on the NATO defence benefits—especially since a majority of spending is done by the U.S.—by contributing significantly less than 2% of their GDP to defence. Many do not even have a roadmap to reach that benchmark. Agreeing to do something, then failing to follow through while continuing to benefit from the security umbrella provided by others, is an act of bad faith and creates what in politics is known as the free-rider problem.

While I understand why (it’s pretty tough to have a good reputation globally when Trump is your president), it’s starting to feel to me like just another flavor of American arrogance. The idea that America is the ultimate hero and that they are the ultimate villain comes from the same place. Blaming every global conflict, every global economic downturn, and every unfavorable cultural movement on the US is just reinforcing the idea that America is the center of the world, and that other countries don’t have their own agency and culture. 

I’ve seen people blame both the Israel/Palestine and Russia/Ukraine wars on the US (they’ve obviously played a part in these wars, but let’s not act like those countries don’t have their own agency and make their own decisions). I’ve seen people blame anti-blackness on the US (as if the US invented racism, and it doesn’t exist in every country on earth).

First of all, the vast majority of people would put themselves and their families above strangers. 

I’m not poor, but a million dollars would still get rid of like 95% the of the stress in my life. 

For a financially struggling person, it would literally change their entire life. 

Sorry random stranger, but I value my life over yours.

Second of all, there’s the cognitive dissonance involved.

You simply press a button and get your money. You don’t know who died, you didn’t see them die, you can’t even really confirm if anyone actually died. It’s entirely different than someone handing you a knife and having to actually get your hands dirty.

It’s similar to why non vegans don’t feel guilty when eating meat or other animal products. But most will if they had to kill an animal personally.

1knit77,CMV: American Tipping is toxic and you're not actually paying for any service.,"Frank and Joe go out to eat together.

Frank gets a water, refilled twice and burger.
Joe gets 2 cocktails and a steak.

They get separate checks.

Frank tips $3.00 on his $12.00 check. (25%)
Joe tips $6.00 on his $60.00 check (10%)

Joe paid TWICE as much as Frank did for the exact same service (actually less service because he got one less drink delivered to him), and yet most people will consider Joe a cheap asshole. 

If you pay for the food and tip for the service, why is the tip based on the food?

It's just a scam to get as much money out of you as they can, because it's easier to slip in a bigger tip expectation into a larger amount.

1knmzjy,CMV: Bachelor's degrees today are what high school diplomas were 40 years ago.,"A high school diploma 40 years ago could get you almost any job that didn't require advanced degree (e.g. MD/DO, JD, VMD, and etc.). But if you look at job postings today for jobs that didn't require any higher education such as receptionist, data entry, retail manager, and etc. have some sort of higher education requirement or strong preference. Someone could live comfortably with a high school diploma job in the middle class up until the 80s.

In the 1980s the high school graduation rate hovered in the lower 70 percent range. Fast forward today, it is now upper 80 percent and in some areas its upper 90 percent. Now does that mean student have become more studious, scholarly, or our education system have drastically improved? Most middle schoolers today probably read and write at a grade school level and can't solve basic quadratic equations let alone any algebraic problems.

One could argue the education system since the 80s has made more strive to be equitable and inclusive to everyone and resulted in artificially pumped up graduation rates so that schools could receive more praise, funding, and attention. We awarded more for less.

Bachelor degrees are now seen as the only viable path to middle class but yet most have a negative ROI if you factor in the cost of attendance and the compounding interest from student loans. No one should have to go college to live a middle-class life. If you want to move up into higher socioeconomic tax bracket then that is what college should be for.

1krvvrf,CMV: There is no realistic path to dismantling Israel as a Jewish state,"I rarely discuss Israel/Palestine. Made the mistake of trying to have a conversation in a thread full of people shouting 'Dismantle Israel' in a news sub and got permabanned. Feel free to check my comment history.

I understand it's a topic many people are passionate about, but so much of the 'discussion' is just screaming, with zero solutions that aren't just genocide. I am, sincerely, not seeing a realistic path forward where Israel is dismantled or radically reformed by outside forces. It's not like South Africa, where whites were a small minority ruling over a large majority of black people, and political and economic pressures were enough to eventually force a free election. It was a fragile, minority rule system to start with. But in Israel, right now, the population is ~75% Jewish. Even if we imagine adding the Palestinians of Gaza to the population, Jews will still be a majority. A free election in a combined Israel & Palestine would still look pretty close to what's already in place. Like what's the plan here? Because 'Two state solution' obviously is not what a lot of pro-Palestinian people have in mind. Not among protestors, and most definitely not on reddit. There is a very strong sentiment that Israel should just cease to be, rarely making any mention of what should happen to the people there.

You can't take the vote away from the Jews, because if you do, Hamas or something like it will win, and their *explicit* goals are to murder the entirety of the Jewish people in the region. Just look at the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund. The Gaza government loudly and openly paid the families of any muslim who murdered any Jew in Israel *for any reason*. Life in Gaza is abject misery right now, and half the population is *still* supporting the October 7th attacks. What exactly do people think will happen if the Palestinians are allowed to decide what happens to the Jews in Israel? That would just be an even bigger bloodbath than the current war.

So... what's the alternative? Expelling all the Jews? And send them where, exactly? Many of them are the children or grandchildren of Jews who were expelled from other Arab countries in the 20th century. You think sending them back to dictatorships that confiscated all their grandpa's property and kicked them out already is a good idea? No? Alright, you think we can find a country willing to take in 7 million Jews? No? Alright, should we forcibly split them up and guard to make sure they are only ever a small minority wherever they go? That hasn't worked out great, historically. Help me see a realistic solution here, people. I'm not condoning the actions of the IDF or the current Israeli government, but you have to be *for* something. You can't just shout ""From the River to the Sea"" and pretend 7 million Jews will just go away. Give me a sane, realistic path forward that doesn't devolve into a second holocaust.

1ks9e3g,CMV: Abortions should be legal because they do no appreciable harm when done properly,"I've thought about this topic from both sides and I honestly can't think of a legitimate argument for why abortion should be illegal. I'll present the arguments I've heard against abortions here and refute them in the ways I would argue.

""Every human being should have the right to life."" A human fetus really hasn't started living a human life yet. It's never laughed or cried or even seen the light of day. And if the mother wants to abort it, then it hasn't formed any meaningful social connections either. If I were to ask you what day you would consider to be the first day of your life, you'd say the day you were born, not the day you were conceived. If you're not even living a human life yet then you're not really a human being yet.

""Wait, but you just called it a human fetus back there! You're admitting it's a human being and therefore  it has the right to life!"" No, a human fetus isn't a human in the same way that human hair or a human hand isn't a human. Just because something is made of human cells doesn't make it a human being.

""A fetus is a baby, and you wouldn't kill a baby."" Calling a fetus a baby just goes against common sense.  No one in their right mind would place smashing a petri dish with a human IVF embryo in it and killing a baby on the same moral tier. It just goes against intuition. If you google image search ""baby,"" you would never find a picture of a fetus no matter how long you scrolled for.

""My religion says life begins at conception."" And I believe that it doesn't. We're both allowed to have our own beliefs, but beliefs don't form rational arguments. Logic and reason do.

""Abortion scars women for life."" Not getting an abortion when you don't want to give birth is even more scarring. No one gets an abortion because they like doing it, it's just the lesser of two evils.

""Some women die during abortions."" The WHO says ""Deaths from safe abortion are negligible, <1/100 000 *(5).* On the other hand, in regions where unsafe abortions are common, the death rates are high, at > 200/100 000 abortions."" I imagine unsafe abortions occur in places where abortion is illegal, but that's just my supposition. Either way, death by abortion doesn't seem like a huge issue.

I could list other counter-arguments I can refute, but I'll stop there. At the end of the day, women (and everyone for that matter) should be able to control the inner workings of their bodies as much as they can. That much seems like a common-sense human right to me. And lastly, what kind of a life could you expect to have if your own mother didn't want to have you? Abortions ensure that only babies that would be cared for and that are wanted would come into being. So being pro-choice isn't just being pro-choice, it's also being pro-love.

1kt66a7,CMV: we on the progressive left should be adding the “some” when talking about demographics like men or white people if we don’t want to be hypocritical.,"I think all of us who spend time in social bubbles that mix political views have seen some variants on the following:

“Men do X”

Man who doesn’t do X: “Not all men. Just some men.”

“Obviously but I shouldn’t have to say that. I’m not talking about you.”

Sometimes better, sometimes worse.

We spend a significant amount of discussion on using more inclusive language to avoid needlessly hurting people’s feelings or making them uncomfortable but then many of us don’t bother to when they’re men or white or other non-minority demographics. They’re still individuals and we claim to care about the feelings of individuals and making the tiny effort to adjust our language to make people feel more comfortable… but many of us fail to do that for people belonging to certain demographics and, in doing so, treat people less kindly because of their demographic rather than as individuals, which I think and hope we can agree isn’t right.

There are the implicit claims here that most of us on the progressive left do believe or at least claim to believe that there is value in choosing our words to not needlessly hurt people’s feelings and that it’s wrong to treat someone less kindly for being born into any given demographic.

I want my view changed because it bothers me when I see people do this and seems so hypocritical and I’d like to think more highly of the people I see as my political community who do this. I am very firmly on the leftist progressive side of things and I’d like to be wrong about this or, if I’m not, for my community to do better with it.

What won’t change my view: 

1) anything that involves, explicitly or implicitly, defining individuals by their demographic rather than as unique individuals. 

2) any argument over exactly what word should be used. My point isn’t about the word choice. I used “many” in my post instead and generally think there are various appropriate words depending on the circumstances. I do think that’s a discussion worth having but it’s not the point of my view here.

3) any argument that doesn’t address my claim of hypocrisy. If you have a pragmatic reason not to do it, I’m interested to hear it, but it doesn’t affect whether it’s hypocritical or not.

What will change my view: I honestly can’t think of an argument that would do it and that’s why I’m asking you for help.

1ky5bcm,CMV: It is high time we stop normalising islamism.,"We’ve had this discussion before, and I still stand by it, more strongly than ever: it’s high time we stop normalizing Islamism and start calling it what it is — a regressive, authoritarian ideology that stands in direct opposition to liberal democracy, secular values, and individual rights.

Let’s be clear. From systemic homophobia and deeply ingrained misogyny, to apologia for child marriage, terrorism, and ambitions for a global caliphate that would erase pluralism and national sovereignty — these are not fringe elements in Islamist discourse. They are core tenets. They are preached openly in mosques, embedded in school curricula in some countries, and often tolerated or downplayed in diaspora communities. These views are not “extreme” by accident — they stem from the fusion of politics with literalist religion.

And yet, somehow, in a grotesque twist of moral confusion, the Western liberal establishment continues to protect and even promote these ideologies under the banner of tolerance, multiculturalism, and inclusion. Left-liberals, who claim to stand for women’s rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and secular governance, suddenly become apologists when the violators of these principles cloak themselves in the garb of “minority rights.”

This selective outrage, this refusal to apply liberal principles universally, is not compassion — it is cowardice. It is betrayal. It’s a compromise of core democratic values in exchange for votes, virtue-signaling, and a hollow sense of moral superiority.

We must stop conflating criticism of Islamism with racism or bigotry. Islamism is not a race. It’s a political ideology — and like fascism or any other form of totalitarianism, it must be rejected outright, not coddled. Enough with the double standards. Enough with letting clerics who call for stoning or apostasy laws be treated as “community leaders.” Enough with allowing veiled theocracy to parade around as culture.

If someone openly supports Islamism, they are not simply expressing an opinion — they are rejecting democracy, secularism, and basic human rights. And they should be treated accordingly: with moral condemnation, not validation.

This is not a call for oppression. It is a call for clarity. Tolerance ends where intolerance begins. A liberal democracy cannot survive by embracing the very ideologies that seek to destroy it from within.",Middle_Exercise_1549,2710,0.7599999904632568,2266,1748506300,2025-05-29 03:11:40,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ky5bcm/cmv_it_is_high_time_we_stop_normalising_islamism/,5,2025
1kyairx,"CMV: The Islamic Golden Age was driven by individual geniuses, not Islamic orthodoxy—and modern glorification of it is dishonest","**Note that this text was translated from Arabic to English by AI and I reviewed it and edited some parts too**  
**---**

I've come to believe that much of the praise Arab Muslims today give to the so-called ""Islamic Golden Age"" is misguided. It treats a handful of brilliant thinkers—like Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Al-Razi (Rhazes), Al-Khwarizmi, and Ibn Rushd (Averröes)—as if they were the natural products of Islamic orthodoxy or Arab culture, when in fact many of these scholars were marginalized, persecuted, or even declared heretics in their time by the very religious and political institutions Muslims now revere.

  
My view is based on several key points:

* **Many of these scholars were persecuted**, not celebrated, in their time. Al-Razi criticized religion and was reportedly blinded by mobs incited by clerics. Ibn Rushd’s books were burned, and he was exiled. Ibn Sina was condemned by Al-Ghazali and accused of heresy.
* **Most were not Arabs**, and many weren't even working within Arab-dominated systems. Persian, Central Asian, and Turkish scholars made some of the biggest contributions, often in relatively tolerant courts like the Buyids or early Fatimids—not under the more orthodox Sunni caliphates. Labeling their work “Arab” or purely “Islamic” science erases the diverse and often non-Arab environments that enabled their ideas.
* **Orthodox Islam turned against philosophy and rationalism.** Thinkers like Al-Ghazali (Algazelus) or Ibn Taymiyya  argued that reason must submit to revelation, which helped shut down the momentum of intellectual inquiry. Theologians who attacked science and philosophy are ironically treated as heroes today, while the thinkers they suppressed are also glorified—this contradiction makes no sense to me.
* **Modern Arab-Muslim societies don’t carry on this legacy.** If Islamic civilization truly had a systemic, religiously-driven scientific culture, why didn’t that legacy continue? Why are major scientific contributions today mostly coming from secular or Western systems? It seems to me that the original scholars were outliers who thrived *in spite of*, not because of, dominant religious culture.

In short, the actual drivers of scientific progress during the Islamic Golden Age were not mainstream Islamic institutions but rather individual genius, cultural cross-pollination (Greek, Indian, Persian), and relatively liberal courts. The glorification of this period by modern Muslims often ignores the uncomfortable truth that mainstream orthodoxy largely opposed or suppressed this intellectual flowering.

  
One more thing I'd like to add that wasn't in my original Arabic text:  
It is also worth noting that many of these scholars, received support not from orthodox Sunni sects, but from non-orthodox Muslim groups like the Shi'i Buyids or even early Fatimids \[whom I myself don't support\], these dynasties most of the time provided MORE intellectually tolerant environments and societies that actually valued rationality and science. Again, while I may not personally align with their theology, it's clear as the sun that they actually created conditions in which rationalist inquiry and scientific advancement are accepted and celebrated, unlike the more rigid circles that later dominated Sunni orthodoxy

  
Why I hold this view:  
I believe the Islamic Golden Age is often misrepresented by most modern Arab Muslims. Many of the scientists and philosophers now celebrated were persecuted by religious authorities of their time. Thinkers were exiled or attacked, not embraced. Most weren’t even Arab, and many were supported by non-orthodox Muslim courts, like the Buyids and Fatimids, that tolerated rationalism, while Orthodox Islam later rejected this intellectual legacy. So I think glorifying it today feels dishonest",Thormosphere_,1578,0.800000011920929,204,1748524548,2025-05-29 08:15:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kyairx/cmv_the_islamic_golden_age_was_driven_by/,5,2025

1kyh02q,CMV: Liberal social causes often hurt themselves by being too extreme or rigid.,"I agree with most liberal values — equality, inclusion, justice, all that. I’m not against any of it. But sometimes it feels like the *way* these causes are pushed ends up turning people off, even people who are mostly on board.

Things like:

* The language expectations change constantly, and if someone messes up or says something outdated, it feels like they get jumped on instead of just being corrected.
* There’s this “all or nothing” vibe, where if you disagree with one part, suddenly you’re not an ally anymore.
* And the public shaming stuff — even when people are clearly trying to grow or figure things out — just doesn’t feel productive. It starts to feel more about calling people out than actually changing minds.

To be clear, I’m not saying people should get a pass for being racist, sexist, or anything like that. I just think some of the tactics used end up pushing away people who might otherwise support the cause.

So I’m wondering — am I off base here? Is this a real issue within progressive spaces, or am I just misunderstanding something?",ChonchKing,540,0.75,998,1748540333,2025-05-29 12:38:53,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kyh02q/cmv_liberal_social_causes_often_hurt_themselves/,5,2025
1kzv1tu,"CMV: Out of all the groups that immigrate to western countries, Muslim Arabs are hands down the worst at assimilating to western standards","I am saying this as an Exmuslim Arab myself and yes, I know there’s exceptions. I know they’re not all that way. But the painting is on the wall. I’m not saying anyone should abandon their religion, but integration is very important when you are moving to a new country. 

The reason why immigrants coming from let’s say Mexico or Latin America integrate so well is because western cultures aren’t that different and share similar values. The differences between traditional Islamic Arab culture and western culture are so astronomically different that conflict usually arises. Europe's weak stance on who they let in from the Middle East proves this, just look at Birmingham or at Malmo. 

People say ""racism"" and “Islamophobia” very loosely. If people are coming to your home country(pick many of the EU), causing chaos, pushing their own beliefs, killings, getting benefits from a western nation, etc. of course people are going to start getting pissed off. 

Muslim Arabs originally born in the Middle East are used to their thoughts and values being the majority. They get a little confused in melting pot western cultures where they encounter a lot of people with different views. They’re so indoctrinated to think one way that assimilation is nearly impossible. Try going and be a raging Christian in Saudi Arabia, wouldn’t work. You would have to assimilate. 

What you worship or your religion is your business, but to move to a new western nation and expect to force the laws and beliefs of your former nation is just peak disrespect. European countries shouldn’t have ‘no go zones’ because some immigrants refuse to adopt the host country's culture and values.

1kzvm77,CMV: I think incels & redpill bros make dating easier for nice guys,"I know it sounds silly, but I think maybe I owe my life to incels & ""red pill"" toxic men

Recently me & my wife celebrated our wedding anniversary. She told me that she couldn't believe she lucked into marrying me, and it's a statement that is on the one hand absolutely absurd - she's beautiful, caring, has a good job, is a wonderful mother & wife, while I am far less attractive, make less money and could probably reasonably be described as ""a weird nerd"". Still, this woman feels like she's the lucky one to be with me. And the funny thing is I completely believe her.

When we exchanged dating stories in the past hers just seem so terrible, while mine are like ""we went on a few dates, didn't work out"". I think this is why I feel my own path to her was just meeting a few women who just weren't for me but were good experiences overall, while she was living a nightmare of the worst guys in the world until she lucked into me - not the worst guy in the world. Jackpot!

And this has been my experience with a lot of the women I went out with - women who seemed genuinely happy to be going out with me  after having a lot of bad experiences.

And this is why I think all those redpill bros & incels might have actually helped me out a lot. They keep trying to ""science"" the subject of dating, a very subjective individual experience, but in doing so may have created a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy. One metaphor I keep seeing in that context is the one of supply & demand. So... A lot of the paradigms they operate under actually act as self sabotage (like making a woman feel beautiful, safe & comfortable are considered bad things in those circles? Like that whole ""girls don't like nice guys l"" thing?). If we bring it back to that market metaphor - I might have really benefited from the disparity between supply and demand by being not a huge asshole in a market absolutely flooded with huge assholes. 

And it seems to hold true - being a reasonably nice dude seems to make me really appealing to women even now. I get looks. I get flirted with. I get complimented a lot for being a good husband & good dad. I feel like hot shit, and objectively I'm probably not. I married way up. It's absolutely silly that the woman I lucked into marrying thinks she married into me, and I think the way a lot of men (not all men, obviously) behave might have significantly contributed to that. I think all those guys might have accidentally stumbled into being right. Women don't want to date them. But it's likely because they are bitter & hate them, which causes them to become even more bitter & hateful, onboarding new guys into being bitter & hateful, and that makes dating much easier for those who have absolutely any amount of chill.

I have never felt more like women really go for nice guys (actually nice guys, not assholes pretending to be nice), and the more people insist it's not true, the easier time actual nice guys are likely to have with women as long as they manage to avoid growing bitter & resentful ",Orgalop,533,0.7599999904632568,326,1748693491,2025-05-31 07:11:31,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kzvm77/cmv_i_think_incels_redpill_bros_make_dating/,5,2025

1l028yz,CMV: the origin of “Israel has no culture” discourse is Nazi propaganda penetrating the Muslim world.,"A big talking point of the pro Palestine crowd is that ""Israel has no culture it stole all of it culture from others.""
This is a very common idea in the Muslim world today.

My claim is that this is not part of Muslim tradition, and is an import from 20th century Nazi propaganda.

Why I’m convinced:
	•	Pre-modern Muslim writers bash Jews plenty, but never for “having no culture.” The insult shows up only after European antisemitic tracts (like Protocols) hit Arabic presses in the 1920s.
	•	Hitler’s Arabic radio + leaflets (Mufti of Jerusalem on the mic) hammered the “cultural parasite” line all through the war.
	•	Sayyid Qutb, Baʿth textbooks, and 1970s state media basically copy-pasted that language—and that’s what today’s memes echo.

For over a decade now but really in the last 5-6 years the migrant crisis at the border has been really bad for a variety of reasons both outside the United States control and within it but regardless of *why* it happened the unavoidable truth to most Texans was that there was a problem. 

And for years most on the Left dismissed the complaints as racist hyperbole by white folk that didn’t want to share their precious, racially homogenous cities and towns with brown people. When Trump rode to power in 2016, many on the Left proudly declared themselves opposed to his anti-immigration policies and supported the creation of “sanctuary cities”. 

Abbot’s response from to 21-24 was “okay, you want them so bad? Take ‘em” and began bussing hundreds upon hundreds of migrants to cities like Chicago and NYC. The rest is recent history. The migrants arrive and white liberals learn native black and brown Americans don’t like migrants anymore then their Texan fellow citizens, it becomes a toxic symbol of the immigration chaos of the Biden administration and on the Left more broadly.

This feeds into the growing consensus among Americans nationally that immigration is out of control and that we have a crisis at our southern border, which Donald Trump in turn helps use to take back the White House in 24.

The men are just as gross for buying it. There’s no justifying paying to use the bathwater of someone else. We all know how it’s going to be used, and so does Sydney. This entire campaign reinforces the already growing preconceived notion women have that men are lustful, dangerous, creeps.

Because if I say I’m just a man, I’m going to assumed to be straight, and my opinion dismissed as when straight men normally express dissatisfaction with how they are treated and perceived in online female spaces.

With that out of the way-

I think women in online spaces dedicated to women view and treat men in ways that if they were treated themselves would be derided as unfair, immoral, cruel, and unacceptable. Men in these spaces, especially if it involved romance or dating, are judged very critically and harshly by many benign and superficial things, such as:

- the way they look

- the interest and hobbies they hold 

- the way they speak or act 

“But, but, you have to judge people by those things to make sure your compatibility.”

100% agree. 

The problem lies in the double standards.

A clear example that comes to mind is that it is totally acceptable in female spaces to judge a man for being under six foot. There’s a derogatory insult that is played off as just teasing- short kings. But if you judge a woman by her weight, it’s deemed as body shaming.

Men who like fishing get judged. But don’t dare insult women on the hobbies they like because that’s misogyny.

If an “unattractive” man shoots his shot with a girl, he’s laughed, called a troll, referred to as “that” and “it”. But if boys were to do the same to an unattractive girl they’d be called chauvinist bullies.

“Where do get the audacity to-“ is a common phrase, but if men generalize women they’re just continue  stereotypes of women.

“I can’t have my man be girly or feminine.” But if you judge a girl for having masculine interests you’re just continuing the patriarchy. 

Like…do straight men and women even want to date each other at this point? You guys sound so miserable 😭

1l38g9o,CMV: Calling all men predators is inherently sexist and puts off most men from wanting to understand your views.,"It is hard to engage in meaningful conversation with people from various popular subreddits when you already are being demonized as a predator under a generalized view of men. I don't want people to think I am saying that all men are perfect or anything. 

In fact far from it, an estimated 91% of victims of rape & sexual assault are female and 9% male. **Nearly 99%** of perpetrators are male. 

Anything even close to this statistic is insane and horrendous but to even pretend that a majority of men are predators is ridiculous and will just push people further away from understanding your position completely. 

Even the men who got SA'd by other men would be considered predators...

Also, you really think calling out all men for being predators is really going to make any kind of systematic change? You think the men that are predators even care that you call ""all men"" predators? 

I think if anything you are likely enabling them to be predators because now there literally is no difference between a non-predator man and a predator man because they are all predators.

Maybe people are more nuanced than I give them credit for and they don't actually think all men are predators and its just something to say in general to cope with the heinous crimes in this world but I think if you actually want to fix that inequality you wouldn't perpetuate gender stereotypes and making people feel bad for doing nothing and would instead try to have meaningful conversation and understanding. Not in a patronizing educational way but more having a clear understanding of what we can do as people to make sure everyone is safe because it seems like predators have tricks they use to try to isolate their victims etc.. and men can be a little bit socially inept so knowing when women need help when its less obvious is key I think.

This is also not exclusively women spaces or something before you think I am going into women's only subreddits and criticizing them for what they want to say to each other. 

TLDR: I don't think saying ""all"" for any group of people is really correct ESPECIALLY when its not even being used as a shorthand to refer to a majority. It just further distances understanding between men and women and leads more men to be burnt out or increasingly apathetic towards these issues and not think its even a problem when it seriously is a problem.

1l9r3wh,CMV: There is no practical way for Israel to conduct operations against Hamas that Leftist/Progressive movements will find acceptable,"I am defining “Leftist & / or Progressives movements” as the dominating, majority attitudes and narratives of the leftist & progressive movements in western countries in regards to Israel. An argument that “not all leftists think the same” will not win me over.

I do not believe there is a way for the nation of Israel to conduct operations against Hamas that Leftist and/or Progressives movements will find acceptable. I believe this for the following reasons:

https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/880818a.htm 

In the founding charter of Hamas, it states the organizations goals are to eliminate Israel and to eliminate Jews. The founding charter rejects peaceful solutions, and states this goal must be accomplished via any violence necessary.

To accomplish this goal, Hamas has used the following tactics: 

- Suicide Bombings
- Hostage Taking and Kidnappings of Israeli civilians and soldiers
- Indiscriminate Murder when present in Israeli territory 
- Continual Rocket Launches
-  Utilized Palestinian civilians as human shields
- stolen aid intended for Palestinians
- destroy infrastructure meant to provide resources to the Palestinians instead to reuse as weaponry 

These tactics all by themselves are atrocious. However, there is the added caveat that **Hamas is the ruling government of Gaza.** This means that Hamas is using **state resources** that functioning states would use to build infrastructure, feed the population, and develop the nation, Hamas instead divert in order to conduct their war effort against Israel.

When looking at the options that Israel has at its disposal to deal with Hamas, there are **no options available that Leftist/Progressives find acceptable.**

- To prevent suicide bombings and the indiscriminate murder and kidnapping of its citizens, Israel has erected checkpoints and a border wall with the Gaza Strip. But this contributes to leftist and progressive arguments that Gaza is an “open air prison”.

- to prevent Hamas from acquiring advanced weaponry the Iron Dome would be unable to deflect and thus lead to the leveling of cities in Israel, Israel maintains a blockade of Gaza. Again, this has been met with cries from leftist and progressives that Gaza is an open air prison and stopping aid from getting through. 

- to prevent Hamas from continuing to launch rockets from a given location within Gaza territory, Israel exterminate the aggressor by liquidating the site with rocket fire. But because Hamas used human shields, Israel is met with accusations from leftists that Israel is targeting civilians with inevitably a hospital or school that is being used as a site to launch rockets ends up having civilian casualties. 

- to prevent Palestinians civilians from getting hurt in urban warfare, Israel has attempted to evacuate citizens from areas it plans to do these operations. But once again, Israel is met with accusations from leftists and progressives that Israel is trying to “deport/ethnically cleanse” Gaza.

I am making this post because Leftist and Progressives always are criticizing Israel in how it conducts itself against Hamas. These same groups, however, always fail to provide **practical alternatives** to how the state of Israel should conduct operations in away that guarantee its own safety as a nation while being deemed “morally / ethically acceptable.” I am open to hearing these suggestions, but so far no good answers have been provided.

If a blockade, border security, air strikes, evacuation zones, and military invasion are all unacceptable methods for dealing with Hamas and protecting itself **what solutions do Leftists and Progressives find acceptable**?

1l9tl0s,CMV: The only likely end to the conflict is for Gaza to be wiped out entirely.,"This is NOT a discussion of the morality of Israel’s or Hamas’s actions. It is a view of what will happen and how the war will end. 

On October 7th I immediately thought that Israel would use the attacks as justification to completely destroy Gaza (and eventually occupy the land). Today, as the conflict continues and many attempts at ceasefires have failed, I believe that Israel will continue the war until Gaza is completely destroyed and its people relocated or killed. 

It seems to me that all attempts at peace are fruitless and I haven’t seen any probable solutions proposed. Furthermore, it seems that the US will continue to provide weapons and support to Israel at least for the rest of Trump’s term. 

Please change my mind. I’m specifically looking for a possible (at least somewhat likely) end to the war that does not include the annihilation of Gaza.

1l9v6g2,"CMV: There is no good reason, with the exception of special needs cases, to homeschool children in the US. Homeschooling is, again with that one exception, always a manifestation of the parent's desire for control, not of the child's best interest. Notes and Caveats in Body","The one notable exception is for a child with special needs, if you live in an area where the local public school system does not have adequate staff/training/facilities to educate your child. In that case, I would agree there is a good reason to homeschool. Otherwise, there are none. 

Common Objections-

1- But my school district sucks!: Unless you are a world class educator, which you probably aren't, even a fairly mediocre or overworked school system will still be able to provide your child a better education through the network of dozens of trained professionals your child will have access to over a given school year, than you can alone. Is the height of hubris to thing that you are equal to or better than a math teacher+ reading teacher+ history teacher+ social studies teacher+ science teacher+ gym coach+ guidance counselor, etc etc etc, even fairly mediocre ones. You are not.

2- But our schools are dangerous!: Then send them to a private school. Not all private schools are for rich people, there are middle class and even working class private schools. The tuition to these school will still cost less than the expense of your own training to properly educate, the materials, and your own time spent being a home educator rather than being out working. I get that maybe you WANT to be a stay at home educator, but again, if the best interest of your child and there education is genuinely your priority, even if your public schools are terrible, you will do better by them if you work a job and spend that wage on private school tuition. You are not a replacement for a school. If you are in a situation where you cannot afford even a low end private school, then you are not in a position to be able to afford to do a better job than your public school would anyway.

3- But my children will be exposed to (insert thing I don't like): Good! Social skills and learning how to navigate mixed company settings and social spaces with difference influences and cultures and ideas is just as important to be a properly adjusted and functioning adult as the book learning. In some contexts even more so.

  
What will change my mind: 

Some scenario, other than the single notable exception I listed above, where I am convinced that being homeschooled will actually result in a better education and better intellectual, emotional, and personal development than enrollment in a public school would, WHILE ALSO being a situation where a low end private school is also out of the question.

1lb86kj,CMV: Israel attacking Iran makes perfect sense.,"Iran built its entire Israel strategy around a network of proxy states and paramilitary groups. They spent tens of billions of dollars arming Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis and supporting Bashar Al Asads regime in Syria. 

The goal of this investment was to encircle Israel and grant Iran the ability to threaten Israel on multiple fronts while protecting Iranian territory. 

This strategy failed big time and faster than anyone could imagine. 

In less than two years, Israel has nearly annihilated Hamas, decapitated Hezbollah, precipitated the fall of Asad’s Syria, and is perfectly capable of handling the Houthis who turned to be more of a nuisance than a threat. 

Iran is now alone, reasonably broke, and at its weakest. 

Israel is winning on all fronts and has retained the military support of all its allies. Add to this the potential alignment of the entire Levantine region with Saudi Arabia.

1ldftpo,CMV: Americans and people in the West who believe the Russian talking points about the war against Ukraine are some of the stupidest people in the world,"I understand the title comes across as harsh, but this is true as it gets. With Russians living in russia it makes sense why they believe the lies told, but for Americans and people in the west that have access to information free from the russian state, it just stupid.

Let me be crystal clear: I'm not saying that every single person who questions the war in Ukraine is stupid. Nor am I saying that questioning U.S. foreign policy will necessarily turn one into an ignorant individual. But when I hear people in the West—especially Americans—parrot talking points verbatim from the Kremlin propaganda machine, I can't help but question that we're working with some of the most gullible, uninformed, and plain stupidest individuals on this earth.

You don't have to be a geopolitical sage to see what's going on. A nuclear power dictatorship ruled by a man in office longer than the majority of Reddit users have been alive bombs a sovereign democratic neighbor. It takes land, kills civilians, and targets infrastructure—flagrant violations of international law. And still, there are Western apologists for it.

Some of the arguments I continually hear:

""NATO provoked Russia.""
Even if you believe that NATO expansion was a failure, nobody can explain an all-out invasion of a country that did not pose a threat to Russia. Ukraine was far from joining NATO when the invasion began.

""Ukraine is corrupt.""
True, but so is Russia—on a far larger and more systemic scale. Ukraine was (and continues to) work towards reforms and conduct democratic elections. Russia poisons journalists, jails opposition, and occupies neighbors. If corruption deserves an invasion, half the world is up for sale.

""The U.S. does bad things too.""
Yes, America does have a dirty history. That is no reason for Russia to be given a free pass to commit war crimes. This is the most idiotic whataboutism. Two wrongs do not make a right.

""It's all fake news, Ukraine is losing, it's just Western propaganda.""
This is astounding. Westerners with access to free media fall for easily debunked propaganda from state-run Russian sources. They gobble up blatantly staged ""news"" segments, fake maps, and appallingly terrible military analysis. If you believe that RT or some Telegram account with a hammer and sickle avatar avatar is providing you with the ""real story,"" I've got a bridge to sell you.


To believe these talking points is to disregard mountains of evidence, credible reporting, satellite imagery, war crimes reports, and the lived experiences of tens of millions of Ukrainians. And for what? To feel like you're ""not like the sheep,"" that you ""know the truth"" when in fact you've been conned by one of the most well-documented propaganda operations of the last century?

This kind of idiocy is not innocuous either. It undermines democratic solidarity with Ukraine, emboldens authoritarian governments, and mocks the very principle of truth in the public sphere. It's not ""just an opinion"" when it is grounded on falsehoods, and it is openly calling for a war of aggression.

So certain, I'll say it again: if you live in a free country that can access facts and still choose to believe Putin's disinformation, then you're voluntarily ignorant, intellectually lazy, or woefully gullible.

1ldyb9e,"CMV: Hasan Piker isn’t a good representative of the left-wing because of his uncritical amplification of extremist talking points, selective bias, and toxic on-air behavior","Hey everyone,

I’ve been not followed Hasan for a long time. I have recently started watching his videos. I agree with him on mostly all US politics. I respect this role as a critical and popular voice against trump. But recently there has been a search for the face of left wing media (a Joe Rogan figure) and many people believe Hasan fits this bill. I frankly strongly disagree.Here’s why:

1. Platforming Extremist Narratives

a. He’s hosted a self-described “Houthi pirate” who openly celebrated hijacking a commercial vessel for the Houthis (a U.S.-designated terrorist group) and largely praised that action as resistance.

b. On multiple occasions he’s given airtime to pro-Hamas or pro-Hezbollah talking points—labeling them “resistance”—without clearly calling out the atrocities those groups commit.
Any right wing figure will be rightly called out for such behaviour. 

2. Selective Criticism & Unacknowledged Bias

a. Hasan fiercely defends Muslims against Islamophobia but has never publicly criticized any Islamic organizations (even those linked to radical violence).
b. He’s quick to call out Christian nationalism yet seems unwilling to hold similar standards for an Islamist or extremist-linked institutions—suggesting a religious or identity-based double standard.

For someone to be the face of diverse left wing they need to call out all extremists.
 
3. Journalistic Oversight & “Bad Journalism”
a. In a segment on a recent Kashmir terror attack, he invited a guest who downplayed the murder of Hindu tourists and refused to acknowledge known facts from multiple credible sources —yet Hasan didn’t  challenged
 those claims and just platformed his views.

b. He often frames news as raw “takes” rather than rigorous, sourced analysis, letting guests push one-sided narratives uncorrected.

4. Toxic On-Air Persona
a. I don’t find his style of masculinity healthy. It’s not better if a left wing man is shouting and showing off his alpha masculinity.

5. Is He Unique?
No. Sure, he does left-wing commentary on Twitch and reaches millions, but dozens of other commentators do the same without normalizing extremist violence or dog-whistling to their base.

My Position:
I believe a credible left-wing media figure should platform all sides responsibly, call out extremist ideology—regardless of religion or politics—provide context and fact-checks in real time, and model respectful, non-toxic discourse. Hasan Piker fails on these fronts often enough that I can’t see him as a good representative of progressive values.

CMV: I’m open to the possibility that I’m being too harsh or missing broader context. As I said I just started watching him recently so what I have written is based on the videos I watched , Reddit threads (pro and anti) and factchecking with Chat GPT. I have done my due diligence without watching all his videos as frankly I don’t want to give my time to that. What am I overlooking? Are there examples where Hasan has consistently held all extremists to account, or moments where he’s moderated extremist guests rigorously?

1lffpfd,"CMV: Israel’s attack on Iran was intended to draw the US into war, not prevent Iran from having a nuke","Israel claims its attack on Iran on Friday was about preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. I think that this is a pretty transparent lie for the reasons below.

Israel has been claiming Iran has been close to a nuclear weapon for 30 years. North Korea is significantly less advanced than Iran, but has successfully developed a nuke during that time period. 

Iran previously had a nuclear weapon program. That ended in 2003 to avoid getting attacked by the US. Since then, it looks like it’s strategy has been to use its nuclear capability for deterrence. (“stop fucking with us; we can build a nuke pretty quickly”)

It is clear that Iran does not want a conflict with the United States. Openly weaponizing their nuclear program invites that conflict. 

Of course, they could pursue weaponization in secret. But the US, UK and Israel knowingly misrepresented evidence of WMD prior to the Iraq war. It is more than fair for the public to demand proof of weaponization since one party in this conflict has previously used this exact same lie as cover for regime change.

Israel does not have the ability to inflict significant damage to Iran’s nuclear program or pursue regime change in Iran on its own. Even if they had the capability to destroy Fordow, the enriched uranium is almost certainly spread out across the country. If Iran’s entire nuclear program including the uranium were destroyed, it could still develop a bomb in under 5 years.

The only ways to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuke is convincing the regime that a nuke is not in their best interest or changing the regime. 

It’s still early, but it seems like Israel’s attack has made the idea of having a nuke more appealing to Iranians and the regime. It looks like having a nuke is the only way to deter Israel and its allies.

So why would Israel attack Iran? I think the most straightforward answer is they were hoping Iran would retaliate in a manner that forced the US to enter the conflict and pursue regime change.

Iran hasn’t taken the bait, so now Israel is attempting to present Iran as neutered by their campaign. “Iran is weak. Come over and help us finish the job”

Iran has been weakened, but they clearly have the capability to inflict more damage on Israel than they have demonstrated. The threat of offensive US involvement has constrained their response.

Once the US attacks, Iran will no longer be constrained by the threat of the US joining the conflict and will retaliate on US/ Israeli assets. The US will officially be in an offensive war that it did not initiate. This was Netanyahu’s actual calculation before Friday.

My view can be changed by concrete evidence of Iran’s nuclear weaponization and/or an explanation of how Israel thinks this bombing campaign will prevent Iran from pursuing a nuke without US involvement.

TL;DR: Israel doesn’t have the capability to meaningfully impact Iran’s nuclear program or pursue regime change on its own. They attacked Iran hoping that they could provoke a strong response that would draw the US into the conflict.

When the United States bombs a sovereign country the leading quote included is ""America does not seek war,"" which is insane as America just committed an act of war.

Meanwhile the Israelis continue to bomb major metropolitan areas in Iran. Yet these attacks are described as ""hitting targets"" with no mention of the civilian causulities involved. Yet when Isreali metropolitan areas are are hit we get detailed civilian casualty reports, and almost no mention of what the ""target"" was.

After the recent US attack, it is being reported that a diplomatic solution is still what US high command wants and that a ""larger protracted conflict is unlikely."" This is clearly a lie, and for it to be reported with out any context pushback or counterpoints is pure propaganda.

1li0ee2,"CMV: Trump's refusal to actively prosecute large employers of illegal immigrants reveals he is not running his deportation campaign for security, economic, or moral reasons.","Okay. Here's the deal.

There is a clear and obvious reason why most illegal immigrants come to the United States. It's not because they just love stealing all of our welfare and eating people's cats. 

It is because big corporations hire them. 

The reasons they do this is obvious. It lets them get cheap labor. 

But Trump is not going after them (sample citation: [https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-18/immigration-raids-employer-employee](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-18/immigration-raids-employer-employee) ). Why?

Now, letting a bunch of people into the country without any vetting is bad. We can all agree on that. And every undocumented person who comes in and is sheltered by these big businesses is a potential security risk. But Trump has made no moves to patch this hole or massively penalize companies for making Americans less safe. Thus, either Trump's current deportation plan is not about national security, or he is being extremely stupid and ignoring a massive hole in our national defense.

Let's move on to money, where the inverse is the case.   
  
Far from being a resource sink, Illegal immigrants are actually major economic contributors (sample citations: [https://americansfortaxfairness.org/undocumented-immigrants-contribute-economy/](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/undocumented-immigrants-contribute-economy/) ; [https://cmsny.org/importance-of-immigrant-labor-to-us-economy/](https://cmsny.org/importance-of-immigrant-labor-to-us-economy/) ). They also work jobs that American workers quite frankly are not able to fill: (sample citation: [https://www.rawstory.com/trump-farmers-2672410822/?u=eb87ad0788367d505025d9719c6c29c64dd17bf89693a138a44670acfdc86a46&utm\_source=Iterable&utm\_medium=email&utm\_campaign=Jun.21.2025\_8.59pm](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-farmers-2672410822/?u=eb87ad0788367d505025d9719c6c29c64dd17bf89693a138a44670acfdc86a46&utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Jun.21.2025_8.59pm) ).

Now, if Trump wanted to keep all that money flowing into our economy, he could just ignore the issue or start a generous work visa program that vetted the people willing to come into the country and work for cheap while still letting them come in. He wouldn't be hunting them down with constant, expensive immigration raids. So this can't be about money. 

Finally we move to move on to morals. A lot of people think it's just immoral to cross the border illegally and thus break the law. Even if I don't agree I can accept that. 

But Trump is actively deporting people who are refugees due to US actions (sample citation: [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/afghanistan-trump-deportation-threat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/afghanistan-trump-deportation-threat) ). And human trafficking victims with essential jobs (sample citation [https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-teachers-aide-self-deports-with-us-born-twin-daughters/65089409](https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-teachers-aide-self-deports-with-us-born-twin-daughters/65089409) ). Those people never broke the law at all, and (generally speaking) committed no crimes. Thus there is no moral reason to deport them.

But do you know who is being immoral and breaking the law? Large companies that are aiding and abetting illegal immigrants instead of reporting them to the authorities. If this was about the immorality of breaking the law, then big companies would be causing way more moral harm than individual migrants. And they would be the primary targets. 

So with moral, economic and security reasons for the deportations out the window, the only reasons I can think of to conduct these massive raids is racism, security theater, and/or  as a cover for something else.

Hell all the Russians I know in France are almost all fiercely anti western and genuinely believe Ukraine is full of nazis while Russia has more neo nazi groups then Ukraine ( in Russia nazi means anti Russian tho but they say that while they have been anti Ukraine since forever) and thats despite the fact they live and benefit from the west. Russia is poor cuz they ignore corruption due to that culture of silence and instead of fighting back most delude themselves in Russia is just better mentality and ignore it.

1ljmah1,CMV: The “work is slavery” and anti-work mindset is disconnected from reality,"I’ve seen a growing number of people who claim that humans weren’t meant to work and that we should just enjoy life and reject the 9 to 5. On here, Tiktok, Twitter, it’s like some sort of revolution of lethargic, lazy people. But their perspective ignores something fundamental. Everything they enjoy in life exists because other people do work.

The vacations they post about, the restaurants they eat at, the games they play, the clean water they drink, all of it is made possible by people who show up to jobs every day. Infrastructure, technology, public services, even the internet they use to complain, all depend on a functioning workforce.

It’s not just naïve. It is hypocritical. Especially when some of these same people push for socialist or communist systems where the idea is to redistribute the results of other people’s effort while avoiding responsibility themselves. It is not about fairness. It is about avoiding work and expecting others to pick up the slack.

You do not have to love your job. But pretending that work is inherently evil while relying entirely on the labor of others is not some enlightened view. It is entitled. Also, for those that are saying we shouldn’t work 40 hours a week, you are piled into this. Don’t expect higher wages for less work, it’s asinine thinking.

1ljzl1t,"CMV: Antisocial behavior in the U.S. isn’t caused by poverty it’s the result of cultural rot, zero shame, and a society that rewards dysfunction.","Let’s stop pretending the rising wave of antisocial behavior in the U.S. the shoplifting, fare evasion, open-air drug use, screaming lunatics on public transit, random assaults, and people defecating in broad daylight is all because of “poverty.”That excuse is dead.
There are far poorer countries out there and yet you don’t see the level of unhinged, daily chaos that’s become normal in American cities. They don’t have the money. But they have something Americans don’t anymore: rules, community, shame, and cultural boundaries.

Meanwhile, in the richest country in the world, you have:

People injecting fentanyl on park benches next to children

Grown men having psychotic meltdowns on public transportation while no one intervenes

Teenagers treating shoplifting like a TikTok trend

Commuters stepping over twitching bodies like it’s background noise

Cities turning into outdoor insane asylums and being told “this is compassionate”

This isn’t poverty. This is a culture that collapsed and forgot it’s allowed to say ‘no.’
It’s the consequence of decades of:

Radical individualism (“you do you” taken to delusional levels)

No-fault morality (“there are no bad people, only misunderstood ones”)

Infantilization (“don’t blame them, they’re just victims of the system”)

Gutless institutions (“enforcing rules is oppressive”)

Social decay (“family, discipline, shame who needs those?”)

In many poorer societies, even the most destitute still carry themselves with dignity. There’s pride in being clean, respectful, and honorable even if you don’t have money.
In the U.S.? There’s an entire class of people who are:

Raised with zero boundaries

Addicted to dopamine and self-pity

Trained to blame everyone else

And told by media and academics that rules are violence, and accountability is oppression

And if you dare question this if you say “hey, maybe we shouldn’t tolerate people shooting heroin next to schoolkids”  you’re accused of lacking compassion. Because now, enabling dysfunction is treated as kindness, and expecting decency is considered “punching down.”

I’m not saying everyone struggling is bad. But let’s be honest a lot of what we’re seeing is not just desperation. It’s entitlement, detachment, and learned helplessness in a culture that refuses to enforce any standards.

So no I don’t buy the poverty excuse. There are poorer nations with far less crime, far more public order, and far more functional people. You know why? Because they haven’t completely erased the concepts of shame, discipline, or civic responsibility.

Change my view. If you think this is all about economics, explain why societies with less money and more hardship still manage to function and why the richest country in the world looks more ungovernable with each passing year.

1lk296b,"CMV: Americans shouldn’t call themselves Irish, Italian, German, etc., if they are many generations removed and don’t actively live and contribute to that culture.","I’m from Quebec and there, people tend to identify based on the culture they actively live and participate in. Even if someone has Irish, French, British, or German ancestry and maybe still cooks certain traditional meals, celebrate holidays or knows some family stories they typically say “I’m Québécois,” not “I’m Irish” or “I’m French.” The identity is tied to the culture they were raised in and contribute to daily.
That’s why I find it confusing that many Americans call themselves Irish, Italian, German, etc., when their connection to those places is often distant like a great-great-great-grandparent and they’ve never been to the country, don’t speak the language, and don’t participate in the actual modern culture and society of that nation.
I feel like Americans often blur ethnicity with ancestry and heritage. Just because your family came from somewhere generations ago doesn’t necessarily mean you’re ethnically that today especially if you don’t speak the language, follow the customs, or meaningfully participate in the culture and/or current events. To me, there’s a big difference between having Irish ancestry and being Irish. But in the US, those two things often seem treated as the same.
From my outside perspective, it seems like this happens because a lot of Americans feel disconnected from a specific national culture of their own. The US is a very diverse and mixed country, and in many cases, “just being American” feels bland or culturally empty so claiming an ethnic label feels more meaningful, especially when talking to someone from abroad. It may come from a place of wanting to feel special, grounded, or connected to something old or “real.” I get that. But it also comes across as disconnected, surface level, cringey, cultural sampling and sometimes disrespectful to the people from that nation.
But when people like me from outside the US question this, some Americans react really defensively. It feels like they hear, “You’re bland” or “You have no culture,” when really we’re just trying to understand why ancestry is treated like identity even when it’s really far removed from current lived experience.
In Quebec, even when we still carry on family traditions, we don’t usually claim to “be” the ethnicity unless we were actually raised and lived in that cultural setting. To us, cultural identity is about your lived reality, not just fragments of heritage. It’s the language you speak, the region you live in, the worldview you share, and the culture you contribute to every day.
I’m not trying to mock or insult anyone. I understand people have pride in their family roots and traditions, and that’s valid. I just think there’s a difference between having ancestry and claiming identity, and I’d love to hear from Americans who see it differently. Because as someone who is also from a country that is a melting pot of cultures it’s very confusing.

Please keep it civil this isn’t meant to offend or dismiss anyone’s experiences. I’m genuinely open to having my view changed and understanding this better.

We know that temperament and ideology are heritable both in the form of social indoctrination, but also that literally someone's disposition and biology can lend itself to how religious or conservative they are. People rebel, but not as often as they don't.

All the doom cult of anti-natalism achieves is ensuring that over the next 100 years the majority in the west will have been raised in religious and conservative households and liberally temperamental people will have become a minority.

1lkydu8,CMV: The British Museum is over-hated,"It's a common refrain online to call the British Museum a building full of stolen artefacts. I don't think this is fair for several reasons:

1) Many of the items are from countries and cultures that no longer exist, or have changed so much as to be unrecognisable. For example, Mesopotamian artefacts were not created by Iraqis, Syrians, etc. but by a completely different cultures who have long since disappeared. Modern Egyptians are disconnected from ancient Egyptians by thousands of years of cultural change and multiple migrations or invasions into the region. In many cases, the case for a modern state claiming ownership over an item in the British museum boils down to, in essence, a 'blood and soil' argument- the idea that since they have a genetic and territorial link to an ancient people, they must have the strongest claim. And at which point does a historical link to a culture end anyway? Should we return Ptolemaic artefacts to the Greeks, since it was a Greek dynasty ruling Egypt at the time?

  
2) The British Empire is still part of British history. Although the Brits committed numerous atrocities during the period of empire, it is also true that the time of empire shaped and changed British culture as a whole. Artefacts that are often called 'stolen' represent a time period during which the British people were conquering and exploring the world, and bringing back their treasures to the British isles. The modern fields of archaeology and anthropology were pioneered in London during this time, using artefacts brought back all throughout the empire. Why is this period of conquest and trade, and the artefacts taken during this time, not considered part of British history? As an example, would it be fair for the Brits to demand the return of the Bayeux tapestry because it was made in Canterbury, even though it was paid for by the Bishop of Bayeux?

  
3) Many of the items weren't taken by force, but sold or gifted to individual Brits. If I dug up a pot of Roman coins in a field in Kent, and sold them to the Louvre, would the British government have a right to demand them back in 200 years? Of course this doesn't even cover the additional millions of pounds and thousands of hours spent maintaining, preserving and restoring ancient artefacts by staff at the British Museum. 

  
To be clear, I am completely open to having my opinion changed. I will concede off the bat that there are many objects kept in storage in the BM that will probably never go on public display, and in the cases of these objects, if returning them to their country of origin will result in them going on public display, I would support it. Additionally, there are some objects in the British museum, especially objects looted from African tribes, India, and other colonies, where the direct descendants (great-grand children or similar) of murder victims should be able to claim them. My point here is mostly about the truly ancient artefacts (several centuries or older) for which I don't believe any modern state has a legitimate claim to.",AroooonTV,627,0.7900000214576721,267,1750939435,2025-06-26 07:03:55,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1lkydu8/cmv_the_british_museum_is_overhated/,6,2025

1ll1kuv,CMV: ICE workers and detention facility staff will become the next generation's shameful historical example of ordinary people enabling atrocities.,"I've been hearing reports of the conditions at Migrant facilities in the USA. They already have been terrible, but with the increased quota and lack of new infrastructure its going to get a whole lot worse.

Can it get worse than causing a Pregnant woman's 5 month old fetus to die and sit inside her for days? Absolutely. It is just a matter of time - time that the Trump administration has.

They have a minimum of 1.5 more years if Ds manage to take back the house and senate and frighteningly 3.5 more if they don't. This is more than enough time for atrocities to become normalized and have numbers rack up.

Maybe they will run out of money, but that hasn't stopped the USA from spending.

I believe that if this continues, the truth will eventually come out and there will be a lot of evidence that will eventually get shared. 

When stories come out, politicians will ask for people to be prosecuted. To my knowledge ICE does not have a special judicial system like the military, which can hide crimes because of special treatment. If Ds win the presidency, then the DOJ will prosecute everyone they can and I bet enough Rs will jump in to distance themselves from Trump that it could get bipartisan support.

In this scenario, most ICE agents will be identified and at the very least shunned by society and probably the world. Migrants will tell stories of specific people who abused them. I'm sure texts and conversations will be leaked. Paper trails of who abducted whom will be available. It will be hard to hide.

This all depends on whether or not Trump / Maga lose power and I have a feeling they will when the Trump admin's policies continue to hurt the working class. You can disagree, but with Iran, up-coming medicaid cuts, increased deficit spending for rich people, and higher prices it seems more and more likely.

1lmtogd,Cmv: Democratic Party leaders are spineless and are responsible for the Trump regime.,"A Democrat politician was shot and killed in Minnesota with her husband by a right winger, Nancy Pelosi's home was invaded and her husband was bashed in the head with a hammer by a right winger, I've heard practically nothing. They do nothing to advocate for members of their own party, I see no justified rage, I see no action, no blame put onto republican politicians. These events are in the news for about a minute and then everyone forgets about it. 

Yet when Donald Trump gets shot in the ear by a right winger, the Republicans go off like rabid dogs in the media and blame rhetoric that came from the left and the Democrats BENT THE KNEE. The Democratic Party told their constituents to tone down their language for weeks despite valid criticism aimed at the Trump campaign. 

On top of that, Kamala Harris adopted Trump's immigration policy during the campaign and brought LIZ CHENEY on the road with her. She stopped talking about price gouging, they silenced progressive voices, they silenced Palestinian voices at the DNC, they did everything in their power to win over the imaginary moderate Republican voter. They betrayed their progessive base and expected them to fall in line due to lesser evil voting. Now seeing how much smoke Democrats have for Mamdani, I fear they have yet to learn their lesson.

Instead of countering right wing naratives, institutional Democrats have been adopting right wing talking points. Why would any Republican voter vote Democrat when for years, they've been on opposite sides of the spectrum? You come off as disingenuous when your go from ""No kids in cages"" to ""We can put kids in cages more humanely."" When you adopt right wing policies, when you campaign on having the strongest military in the world while supporting an active genocide, when you advocate for harsher immigration policies instead of talking about pathways to citizenship, DO NOT expect progressive voters to write you in out of obligation. That is a losing strategy. 

Biden's 2020 win came about after a disaterous Trump administration, Trump's 2024 win came about after not only a disasterous Biden administration but a disasterous and confusing Democratic campaign. To this day, I do not know what Harris or Biden really campaigned on other than ""We aren't Trump"" which to be fair, was enough for me, but wasn't enough for many many others.

1lnz5gv,"CMV: Modern ""trad wives"" are the least like actual traditional wives in history.","To start the most obvious reason is that modern trad wives choose to be so. Historically speaking, wives often had no choice. Being a trad wife is what you had to do. 

They rely on tech & conveniences real traditional wives never had. Wvwn rhe washing machine was considered revolutionary, and there was talk at the time that it would destroy what it meant to be a woman, as a ""robot"" was doing her labor, which made her who she was. Today there are numerous other advances which make these modern day trad wives nothing like who they seek to emulate. They're not churning butter all day, they're on tiktok. 

Many trad wives hire maids and babysitters. It's become more common in much of rhe west to hire someone to come clean your house. Often times the women who claim to be trad wives hire cook, maids, babysitters, etc. to do the labor they are saying that wives should do. 

The labor of the past was often physically demsnding. Trad wives today are more of an aesthetic choice and lifestyle. Often rooted more in larping as something rather than being it. It's like a cowboy hat in a lot of ways. Someone can buy and wear a cowboy hat with no cows, or farm, but still the hat resonates with them for what it means aesthetically and historically. It's a larp (albeit a hat is a rather harmless one) 

Their focus is too much just on their family. Historically this isn't accurate. Raising children was often seen as more community focused and families were much bigger and intergenerational. Again, they're making a fictional fantasy of the past and trying to apply it to modern times. 

And of course. The last is the 
Irony which makes up their identities. The reason they can choose to be a trad wife is because of the advances women's rights have seen over the years. 

All in all. Trad wives are obsessed with nostalgia for a past which never existed, and their attempts to form their identities around this fantasy are delusional and not rooted in historical truths.

1lo9q2s,CMV: Most people who claim to be pro-life are just pro-birth.,"Most people who claim to be pro-life actually only care about the fetus not being aborted. They do not care (as much or perhaps at all) about the baby and the family after it is born. 


Many people who are pro-life actively support politicians and policies that harm low-income working-class families or even just have opinions contradicting their “pro-life” stance. 


Cutting funds/ shutting down programs such as Medicaid, WIC, SNAP, early childhood education, etc., actively harms families and children. 
There are tons of people who look down on single mothers or parents trying to get child support from the other parents. 

Some other examples of the fake pro-life stance include:
There has been a push to stop free school lunches as well as to defund public schools. 
The denial of science (vaccines, global climate change). 

I understand that the political movement of pro-life is about stopping abortions, and I agree. The goal isn’t about the care of the child after it’s born. That doesn’t mean you’re actually pro-life. 


If you actively vote for or create situations that are harmful to children and families, you aren’t literally pro-life; you’re pro-birth.

The first year of his term is 6 months in, and they're getting close to being halfway through it already. A lot of it is has been through Trump's executive orders. 

When Project 2025 was all over the news, the main narrative from conservatives was that P2025 was just talk, it was just some weird policy fantasy from an alt-right group. Or they just stayed quiet. But a good amount of Republicans and Republican leaders said that Trump has nothing to do with it, they parroted him when he said he wasn't going to touch it, and any claims that Trump was going to do so was just far-left fear mongering.

1lp5jkf,CMV: Cancel culture wasn’t real and the backlash wasn’t organic it was fomented by the media class,"The panic around “cancel culture” was never really about censorship. No one was getting arrested for saying something controversial. People were getting called out. Some lost jobs or opportunities because they said racist or harmful things publicly. That’s not new. That’s not some moral crisis or the “woke mob”. That’s just consequences.

If I walked up to you and said, “your grandma’s an inbred retard,” would you say, “ah , oh well, free speech”? Of course not. You’d be upset. How you’d react would be on an individual basis, you might want to fight you might ignore me but there would be a reaction . That’s the normal human response. Now imagine someone says something just as offensive online. A school or employer sees it and chooses not to be associated. That’s not cancel culture. That’s cause and effect.

Yes, some people were banned unfairly on social media . Some things were taken out of context. Some people in power definitely used outrage to push agendas. I’m not pretending the system was perfect. But those edge cases don’t prove cancel culture was real in the way it was sold. They just prove the internet is messy and that companies act in their own interest.

But now we’re seeing something different,something real. People are getting fired, doxxed, arrested, blacklisted, and even deported for speaking out against Israel. Not for hate speech. Not for slurs. Just for political criticism.

This is what an actual campaign to silence people looks like. It’s organized. It’s backed by institutions with actual power and capital. It’s not a Twitter dogpile. people are losing visas, getting pulled from speaking events, being detained or fired because they criticized a government, and I’m not even talking about the stead fast pro Palestinians, even the Eternal centrist Piers Morgan was called and Antisemite because he opposed the ethnic cleansing plan that Israel media pundits and EVEN politicians have been bragging about on Channel 14.

And suddenly all the pundits who wouldn’t shut up about cancel culture are completely silent. The media is quiet. The so-called “free speech” defenders are nowhere to be found.

Their silence makes the hypocrisy ridiculously obvious. They never cared about free speech. When it was people on their “side” being held accountable, it was a crisis. Now that it’s critics of Israel being punished, it’s fine & even encouraged.

Cancel culture as it was sold wasn’t real but this is.

The RNC's argument for reducing taxes on the wealthiest Americans is that those wealthiest Americans will then invest what they save in taxes in businesses that produce MORE revenue & taxes for the country & that the wealth they create for themselves will ""trickle down"" as increased wages for the working class.

Is there ANY evidence of this EVER occurring in the USA? Clearly not.

As Warren Buffet points out, he can only drive 1 car. Reducing his taxes so that he can afford 100, 1000 or 100,000 cars won't make him buy more cars.

1lqveh4,CMV: The Republican Party’s Core Seems to Be Cruelty,"I do genuinely want to change my view because I don’t want to label an entire demographic of people as evil however. 

I’ve been watching the political landscape for a while, and I can’t shake the feeling that the modern Republican Party has leaned hard into policies and rhetoric that prioritize cruelty over compassion. It’s not just about “tough love” or fiscal conservatism anymore, it feels like a deliberate pattern. Here are a few examples that stand out to me:

Healthcare: Pushing to repeal the ACA without a viable replacement, which would strip millions of people of coverage. The focus seems less on improving healthcare and more on dismantling protections for the vulnerable, like those with pre-existing conditions.
  
Immigration: Policies like family separations at the border or slashing refugee admissions feel designed to inflict suffering rather than solve any practical issue. The “zero tolerance” approach doesn’t seem to deter migration as much as it punishes desperate people.

Social Safety Nets: Efforts to cut programs like SNAP or Medicaid often come with rhetoric about “personal responsibility,” but they disproportionately harm the poorest and most marginalized people who are already struggling.

Culture Wars: From attacking trans rights to banning books, the GOP’s culture war battles seem to target already vulnerable groups, amplifying division and fear instead of fostering understanding or unity.

It’s not just policy, look at the rhetoric. The glee some Republican leaders show when “owning the libs” or dismissing marginalized groups’ struggles feels less like principle and more like reveling in others’ pain. Even their economic policies, like tax cuts skewed toward the ultra-wealthy, seem to prioritize the powerful over the struggling.


Am I missing something here? Is there a unifying principle I’m overlooking that ties these policies together in a way that isn’t about cruelty? I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially if you lean Republican and see this differently.

1lqvlqf,CMV: American Midterms will be dangerous for Democratic voters,"I want to start off by saying I'm aware of how hyperbolic this sounds. It's a wild thing to say and something I would have scoffed at in previous elections. I will also recognize that this is speculation at this point, but I would argue that speculation is an informed one based on the trends of history and the statements made by the American government currently. 

But looking at American politics I'm convinced it's not operationally the same country anymore. The weaponization of media and demographics research is bold-faced and alarming. 

This isn't necessarily a comment on whether the midterms will be free and fair elections, though I have my doubts about that as well. This is a strong suspicion I have that, based on the comments and attitudes of the American President and the Republican Party, anyone who votes Democrat during the election will be identified as, in the government's eyes, an enemy. 

The danger may not be in the polling room, it may be what comes after. Already there are calls from prominent government officials to rescind citizenship and confine individuals who disagree with them politically but pose no other threat (see the New York mayoral election as an example). I fully believe these tactics are foreshadowing for an eventual weaponization of voting data and party registrations. 

Please change my mind. I don't want this to be the case.

1lqw2r8,cmv: The fiscally responsible party in the United States is the Democratic Party.,"What is the party that explodes the deficit during generally ok periods?  Only Republicans.

Who has started long protracted wars? Republicans.

Look at the [US debt to GDP since ~1970](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S#).

Now look at the [deficit as a percentage of GDP since ~1970](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSGDA188S#).

From this, we can see who contributed the most to the debt as a percentage of GDP.  Generally, a deficit to GDP of no more than 3% is what people like [Ray Dalio](https://youtube.com/shorts/gjb12Vqne2k?si=wv8hQuFg9Vllob3g) say is necessary for sustainable fiscal policy.

These are the clear conclusions:

1. Deficit as a percentage of GDP increased from 0.3% in 1970 to 5.7% in 1983.  This was a period that experienced a severe [recession in 1980](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession).

2. The deficit as a percentage of GDP ranged from 5.7% to 2.7% throughout all of Reagan and H.W. Bush’s terms.

3. Clinton came into office in 1993 with a deficit to GDP of 4.5%.  The deficit shrunk every year throughout the rest of the 1990s, ultimately reaching a surplus of 2.3% in 2000. That is a 680 bps improvement in the budget deficit.

4. The [US invaded Iraq in 2003](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War), resulting in a 3.3% deficit as a percentage of GDP.

5. The Bush administration reduces the deficit to 1.1% of GDP by 2007.

6. The deficit to GDP increases to 9.8% of GDP in 2009 in response to the [Global Financial Crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis).

7. The Obama administration reduces the deficit to 2.4% of GDP by 2015 - reducing the deficit during a period of economic expansion. That is a 740 bps improvement in the budget deficit.

8. Trump increases the deficit every year of his presidency, reaching 4.6% of GDP by 2019 - increasing the deficit during a period of economic expansion.

9. The deficit to GDP increases to 14.7% in 2020 in response to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic).

10. The Biden administration reduces the deficit to 6.3% by 2024. That is an 840 bps improvement in the budget deficit from the trough from the pandemic response - definitely overstated given the magnitude of the pandemic response.  


Now, the Trump administration intends on passing a bill into law that will increase the deficit by $3T. This is further evidence that Trump is fiscally irresponsible.

Republicans consistently increase the deficit in both bad times *and* good times.  Democrats consistently reduce the deficit during good times.

1lul66i,CMV: Donald Trump's presidency is considerably worse for the US then Richard Nixon's ever was,"While both men damaged public trust and democratic norms, Trump’s actions have been more overt, sustained, and systemically dangerous to the integrity of the U.S. & it's institutions. Reasons why Trump is considerably worse for the United States than Nixon ever was:

1. Scale and repetition 

Nixon obstructed justice in the Watergate cover up

Trump has shown a pattern of undermining democratic norms across multiple domains and years, not just one event:
- Pressuring the DOJ to protect allies and target enemies.
- Refusing to release tax returns (breaking modern transparency tradition).
- Firing or retaliating against inspectors general and whistleblowers.
- Using the presidency to enrich his businesses (emoluments concerns).
- Normalizing nepotism and loyalty over competence

Nixon committed a massive coverup and was forced out. Trump’s actions are continuous and ongoing, more public, and go without consequence due to his monopolization of the government and Supreme Court.


 2.January 6th

Nixon lost power due to criminal activity after winning an election.

Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election:
- Spread a disinformation campaign about election fraud
- Tried to pressure state officials to ""find"" votes
- Encouraged fake electors and pressured Pence to block certification
- His rhetoric helped incite the January 6th insurrection, which attempted to stop the peaceful transfer of power

Trump’s actions in 2020–2021 posed a direct threat to American democracy. Nixon abused power to hide wrongdoing. Trump tried to use power to stay in power, even after losing an election.


3. Erosion of truth and spread of disinformation

Nixon lied and covered up crimes, but most Americans believed the media and the system when the truth emerged.

Trump eroded faith in truth itself:
- He branded the press “the enemy of the people”
- Flooded the public with disinformation 
- Popularized the tern “fake news” to dismiss criticism/taint facts
- Promoted conspiracy theories from QAnon to bleach cures for COVID

Trump’s attacks on truth have affected public trust in a more systemic and lasting way than Nixon’s lies ever did.


4. Handling of national crises

Nixon was no hero when it came to Vietnam, but he eventually pulled out and reduced troops.

Trump:
- Downplayed the seriousness of COVID-19, even admitting it privately
- Delayed action, undermined scientists, and spread misinformation
- Mocked masks, discouraged vaccines, and politicized public health

Thousands of avoidable deaths took place because of his + his administration's mismanagement, denial, and politics during a global pandemic.


5. Worsening political polarization and division

Nixon’s presidency created distrust in government

-Trump amplified distrust not just in government, but in democracy, elections, science, education, and journalism
- His rhetoric encouraged political violence.
- He emboldened far right extremism and white nationalism (i.e. ""there were good people on both sides"")
- He fostered us vs them politics with continued attacks on immigrants, Democrats, protestors, & everyone else he disagrees with

6. Impact on public health

To fight poverty, Nixon essentially proposed replacing welfare with a basic income policy for all Americans.

Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"":
- Slashes 186 billion dollars from SNAP and other nutrition programs for low income families 
- Makes significant cuts to Medicaid (12 million+ will lose insurance over the next 10 years) 
- Increases out of pocket costs for seniors on Medicaid


Nixon was a flawed president whose legacy is justifiably stained by scandal. But Trump’s presidency is a more sustained attack on democracy, truth, and accountability, and the damage affects (many) more people. 

These are the reasons why I think Trump is worse; the article I linked provides reasons why Nixon practically looks like a saint in comparison.

1lvhpet,cmv: The Supreme Court allowing Trump to Challenge the Constitution is the most Dangerous thing Happening Right Now.,"So I am a never Trump Republican. One of my core values is that the constitution, while imperfect, has to stand to the letter. This doesn't mean you can't ratify it, it was meant to be, but if the legislature won't amend it then it needs to be followed to the letter of the law. 

Lately, the Supreme Court has issued a couple rulings that I think are absolutely insane in reference to the Trump admin and their challenging of the constitutional protections granted to people in the United States. 1) The ruling to pause all injunctions on Trump deporting people to foreign countries without allowing them to contest, 2) The pause on the injunction against birthright citizenship. 

Both of those appear to be pretty obviously ingrained in the constitution the same way our right to bear arms is, and yet the supreme court casually allowed this administration to push them while delaying an ACTUAL ruling on the subject matter. This is a tactic that seems specifically aimed to allow the court to delay, or even worse set the groundwork to allow the president to violate clear wording in the constitution. 

In my recollection, we've always had the supreme court stand pretty close to the most literal reading of the constitution and for the first time ever it appears they are about to rule against clear wording. The premise that the president may be able to act in defiance of a literalist constitution without a judicial check is probably the most concerning development in my lifetime, and I'd like someone to either A) convince me that the fourteenth amendment doesn't actually grant birthright citizenship, convince me that the due process statement in the constitution doesn't apply to all people in the US (this specifically doesn't say citizens), or B) convince me that this isn't the Supreme Court taking an anti-constitutional approach to rulings and that the core document of our republic is still being respected by the highest court.

In both cases, it feels like people are aligning with ideologies or figures that appear to go against their own interests.

From almost every pizza delivery driver I have talked to over the past few years, they know where make what they used to. This is with gas prices a lot higher, and the cost of living. Many people assume that when you're paying a delivery charge, that covers the driver.

1lyo4fr,CMV: Epstein files scare Trump for reason(s) other than the fact Trump himself is in them.,"For anyone apart from the most deluded cult members it is obvious and public knowledge that Trump is in the files, flight logs and had a close relationship with Epstein.  

Anything that is worse than that could be easily destroyed or covered up well enough for the all too willing cult to accept the Fox news spin of it and move on. Teflon Don has managed to get his following to accept so much already he could certainly find some way to spin his relationship with Epstein such that they would contort themselves to believe even the most ridiculous excuse. 

The way Trump, Bondi and other are handling this now is digging themselves into a massive hole and that screams that there is a far bigger risk. 

I DON'T think Trump is primarily worried about his own inclusion.  I think the bigger problem is dozens of other powerful paedophiles he is somehow obliged to protect.  

I think others that are on the list or in the evidence have a lot more risk than Trump does, as he is essentially immune to investigations, lawsuits, divorce and can brush off a lot of public scrutiny and he has the full power of the DOJ to illegitimately defend him or shut down threats. 

Given how many times Trump was on the flights, at the island and cohorting with Epstein over many years he must have also been interacting with other Predators and paedophiles. Those people must know a lot more than what is in the Epstein evidence and if they go down they can spill serious evidence on Trump.   These are likely many very powerful and (ironically) credible people with lots of resources to go scorched earth on Trump if he feeds them to the wolves 

Trump is likely trapped in a position where he knows he has to protect all the other Epstein paedophiles for fear of what a few of them could expose about his own involvement. 

It is also highly likely that Trump has extorted many of these people already and many may have been forced to support his campaign.  At least a few of them would be smart enough to have insurance. 

This also correlates to his statement regarding the files and the risk to 'people'. 

This better explains the otherwise irrational actions of Bondi etc. Than simply protecting Trump himself which could be done in a less destructive way.

1lytmfs,CMV: True masculinity is advocating for those weaker than you,"

Growing up I was raised by all women and masculinity was something I struggled with. What is manliness? Working with your hands? Shooting guns? Eating steak? Being a stud in the bedroom? Lifting weights and getting swole? Fighting sports such as boxing or UFC? Cars? Being the provider? 

The list goes on and on right?

Now that I've entered my 30's and started a family of my own, I've really began to reflect on lessons handed down to me as a kid 

One of them was ""Boys lookout for family and protect girls, not hurt them""

I always thought this was a little weird but now I'm wondering if maybe it was tapping into something real and raw and amazing.

We as men should never be bully's unless we are speaking truth to power. Like a person with power who is bullying others deserves to be bullied. (DJT and his goons for example)

Men generally are in a position of power of others. People are less likely to start shit with a man versus a woman. 

We are listened to more than women. When our voice is used to advocate for others, it is taken muchmore seriously.

All of this is touching on the privilege of being a man. Obviously being a man has its downsides and there are drawbacks and issues with how society treats men but it is no question that you are dealt a better hand being born a man versus a woman.

So that said, true masculinity is advocating for those weaker than us. Whether it be disabled people. Mentally or physically. LGBTQ people. Women. Children. Animals. Or literally anyone who would have very little power and is being unfairly targeted or bullied.

This is my takeaway from my 30+ years on this planet. This is what it means to be a man. ",Infinite_Kush,1038,0.8199999928474426,479,1752415509,2025-07-13 09:05:09,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1lytmfs/cmv_true_masculinity_is_advocating_for_those/,7,2025
1lz40a3,"CMV: Conservative outrage blasting the Superman movie for being ""woke"" due to its pro-immigrant message proves that the anti-woke movement is pure ignorance","The first issue of Superman originally came out in 1938, and was widely credited for single-handedly creating the entire comic-book genre. 

One of the biggest themes when Superman first came out was portraying immigrants as people who could become the symbol of what is means to ne American. Especially due to what was going on in 1938. 

Fast forward to today, and the new Superman movie is being blasted by conservative figureheads for being ""woke"" due to its pro-immigrant message. 

Not even going to touch that Superman has been used as a figure to condemn racism and xenophobia, which is partially what it means to be woke.  Heck within the first 10 years of its existence, Superman was depicted taking on the KKK.

Being pro-immigrant and anti-racist in the 1930's and 40's is super duper mega woke in that era. 

Even going further, in the 1950's, Superman was used in conjunction with black activists to target racism and segregation, with even official government posters as well (partly why Superman and Batman have a No-Kill policies). 

The fact that conservatives are calling the new Superman movie ""woke"", proves that the anti-woke movement is completely based on ignorance at the least, and bigotry and the worst. Especially since they didn't know that Superman ALWAYS had a ""woke"" message.

1m18iia,CMV: Reddit does a fairly good job of pushing men toward the political right,"I’ve noticed over the years that Reddit, despite leaning heavily liberal/progressive in most of its mainstream subreddits, often ends up pushing young men, especially those who feel isolated or frustrated, further toward the political right. I don’t mean Reddit is intentionally doing this, but the way certain ideas dominate discussion while others are aggressively shut down creates a pipeline effect.

Here’s why I believe this happens:

1. **Blatant misandry is tolerated, even celebrated.** There are threads and comments (often upvoted) that generalize men as toxic, dangerous, lazy, incompetent, or inherently privileged. If someone dares to push back, even with nuance, they often get downvoted or banned. This can create resentment, especially in young men who already feel invisible or villainized.
2. **Censorship of alternative views.** While Reddit prides itself on open discourse, many subs (r/politics, r/TwoXChromosomes, r/AskWomen, etc.) have strict moderation policies that lean left. Posts offering centrist or mildly conservative takes often get removed or massively downvoted, which only fuels the sense that right-leaning voices are being silenced rather than debated.
3. **Echo chambers amplify bitterness.** When men express frustration with societal or gender dynamics, they’re told to “cope,” “be better,” or “shut up.” They are called incels and misogynists. So instead of being heard, they’re mocked. Hence they leave or retreat to smaller communities and even some anti-feminist or redpill-adjacent spaces where they feel validated. These can sometimes push them further right over time.
4. **“Progressivism” is increasingly associated with double standards.** Many men see Reddit pushing for empathy, compassion, and equality, but only selectively. For example, if a woman slaps a man in a viral video, the top comment is often laughter or justification. Flip the genders, and it’s outrage. These inconsistencies make “progressive” ideals seem hollow or hypocritical.

To be clear, I don’t believe Reddit is evil or entirely responsible for people’s ideological shifts. But I do believe it contributes more than it realizes to the alienation of young men and ironically ends up pushing them toward the very side it mocks.

1m1e1a8,"CMV: We shouldn’t keep excusing harmful practices just because they’re part of a religion, including Islam","I believe that harmful practices shouldn’t be protected or tolerated just because they’re done in the name of religion, and that this especially applies to Islam, where criticism is often avoided out of fear of being labeled Islamophobic. To be clear, I’m not saying all Muslims are bad people. Most Muslims I know are kind, peaceful, and just trying to live decent lives. But I am saying that some ideas and practices that exist in Islamic law, culture, or tradition, such as apostasy laws, women’s dress codes, punishments for blasphemy, or attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people, are deeply incompatible with modern human rights values. In many countries where Islam is the dominant religion, these practices are not fringe. They are law. People are imprisoned or even killed for things like leaving the religion, being gay, or criticizing the Prophet. And yet, in the West, many of us are so concerned with respecting Islam that we won’t criticize these ideas openly, even when they violate the same values we would condemn in other contexts. If a Christian group said women need to cover up or they’ll tempt men into sin, most people I know would call that sexist. But if it’s a Muslim community saying the same thing, suddenly it’s “cultural” or “their tradition.” Why do we have double standards?

I think avoiding this conversation out of fear or political correctness just enables oppression, especially of women, ex-Muslims, and queer people within Muslim communities. I also think it does a disservice to the many Muslims who want reform and are risking their safety to call out these issues from within.

So my view is this: Respecting people is not the same as respecting all their ideas. We can and should critique harmful religious practices, including those found in Islam, without being bigoted or racist.",Mysterious_Role_5554,1709,0.8299999833106995,695,1752676099,2025-07-16 09:28:19,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1m1e1a8/cmv_we_shouldnt_keep_excusing_harmful_practices/,7,2025
1m1f9et,CMV: Nobody (practically) actually thinks a fetus/embryo is equivalent to a human life. 99.99% of those who say this are lying to support a position they hold for other reasons.,"Anyone who says that they feel abortion is killing a human this is lying to you. They don't really think that.

**Note- Semantic edge case which is NOT what I am talking about outlined at the end.**

Well, I should be careful about saying ""anyone"". There are 8 billion people in the world. Maybe someone out there really does think they are the same, but for all practical intents and purposes, nobody really does, that is just a line of baloney they use to justify their opposition to abortion. 

We don't have obituaries for miscarriages.

We don't have funerals for miscarriages.

While of course many miscarriages are very tragic for the expectant parent, there are millions, tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of miscarriages every year that are no big deal, or that the woman doesn't even notice, and in fact many are even celebrated. 

Even in cases where the miscarriage is tragic, the parents and the family and the community doesn't mourn it like they would a lost infant. 

If anyone were in a situation where they had to choose between saving one single actual child versus a cooler with say 500 embryos (assuming a scenario where the embryos could be immediately secured and would survive), all of us, in fact almost every human on this planet, would save the child over the embryos without even the faintest whisper of a second thought.

  
Nobody actually thinks of a fetus/embryo as being equal to a human life. The singular and only context where they say this is in the context of compelling women to bear children, or eliminating their ability to voluntarily abort, that is voluntarily miscarry, something that happens ALL THE TIME naturally. In every other context, the death of the born and the unborn are treated as being quite different. 

**Semantic Edge Case- You might have someone out there who tries to argue ""Well, it IS human life, but it's a lesser category of human life that still counts as human but doesn't get the same considerations as fully born persons. Which is why we don't mourn them the same, and don't prioritize them the same."". And ok, fair enough, but that's not really what I am talking about. A person who believes the unborn are human life but of a lesser status and with fewer legal and moral consideration tied to them, I probably actually agree with that person. That's not really what I'm talking about here. I am talking about those who make the argument that they are human in the context of the abortion debate and that they should get the same legal protections and moral considerations as born humans.**

1m1il6o,CMV: Booktok is actually harmful and it's making people less intelligent,"Disclaimer, I'm fully aware that people can have different tastes, just because they enjoy something doesn't mean it has to be groundbreaking, or does it reflect their values and morals. I support people, especially women in this context, to enjoy things however they like. 

Which is why I'm feeling like an internalized sexist, because for the life of me I cannot take the ""Booktok"" community serious. Yes there are good things that they've done like keeping libaries alive and helping people into reading, but I feel like that's too little comparing to the harm they're causing.

  
\- They brag about anti-intellectualism: All the popular books right now are only romance fantasy with very poor quality, with zero care about any plot or characters. When being asked about this, they answer with ""Just turn your brain off"" or straight up admit they don't care about quality and books are supposed to be entertainment only, and refuse to read any book that not solely for entertaining purpose.

\- They don't actually read: So many people in this community brags about ""skimming"" books, so they only read dialogue or the smut scenes. Just so they can brag about how many books they read in a month, without actually comprehend anything they ""read"".

\- They love over-consumption: Majority of them don't even use libraries, only buy brand new books in bulk, without even knowing if they're going to like those books. I don't care what people do with their money, I sometimes waste mine for leisure too, but this doesn't seem too smart? I mean, the act of spending so much money on something you don't even know if you would like is rather strange. 

\- They ruin the book industry: Not in the sense of ""The book industry is making so much profit so nothing's ruined"", but in the sense of they only want the same books with the same tropes and poor quality writing over and over, and refuse to engage with anything that not those. The industry gotta make money so they only publish that kind of book, so we're just not going to have any high quality book anymore. 

\- Actual porn addiction: Majority of them refuse to read any book without smut scenes. And I'm not shaming anyone for consuming adult contents, but I do think you must have problem if you really can only read books with smut, and only skim to the smut parts.

  
I'm really sorry if I come off as offensive, I'm truly not trying to shame people for how they enjoy their hobby and I'm not good with my words (which I know it's ironic that I'm criticizing a book readers community). But I cannot understand why my female peers celebrate this as women can finally have fun, while ignoring all those problems I listed. I'm confused that for a community that brand itself as book lovers, they care more about the appeal and aesthetic of a reader than actually read and care about the content they consume, and are very proud about being shallow. There are very high educated women whom I respect that are in this community and defend it fiercely, and it makes me question if it's really a big of a deal like I think.

Tl;dr: Feel like an internalized sexist for hating a book community with majority are women, help me see the flaws of my bias.

Lately I’ve been seeing more and more spaces that are race-specific like “Black-only healing spaces,” “Latinx-only events,” or “AAPI-only support groups.” And while I totally get the intention behind it (safe spaces, shared experience, etc.), I can’t help but feel like it’s starting to divide people more than bring us together.

I’m not saying these groups shouldn’t exist. I’m more wondering if they are actually helping in the way we hope? Or are they unintentionally making things feel more separate?

I’ve been in situations where I couldn’t join a convo or event because I wasn’t the “right” ethnicity, and it felt... kinda off? Like I respect the goal, but if we’re talking about inclusion and solidarity, shouldn’t there be more cross-race dialogue together , not in separate rooms?

Also what about people who are mixed race? Or people who feel connected to multiple cultures? Where do they fit in?

A sitting president actually called his base stupid and weak, but they are still thanking him on a daily basis. This alone is enough to solidify my view, but let’s continue. 

Trump also famously said that [he loves the poorly educated](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-loves-the-poorly-educated-and-social-media-clamors-idUSKCN0VX2DE/), and it’s very clear why. He can legitimately call millions of his voters stupid and weak, and they will still thank him for it and continue supporting him. Having a poorly educated base in a win for someone like Trump. 

Today, Trumps administration announced that [Obama needs to be prosecuted over 2016 election claims](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/18/tulsi-gabbard-obama-2016-election-russia), which is absolutely hilarious.

I do acknowledge that colonialism and atrocities took place, this is obvious. I don't believe we should forget them, we should talk about them so that we might never repeat them (in theory...). 

In this sense, I do believe that the ""post-colonial"" thinking of ""taking back"" whatever land was taken from you is not morally good or morally bad, it just defends certain interests. These debates often just digress forever and fuel the violence machine. At the end, as history shows, whoever has the biggest and best guns wins, the rest is just wrapping. 

I am generally pro-Palestinian because I believe that you should not indeed flatten a whole region indiscriminately in the hope that it will solve anything.

But I have to admit that I have been watching with a sort of amusement the whole ""Israelis are colonisers, Palestinians are indigenous people"" debate. 

While Zionism is a pure nationalist idea (unless you believe in Jewish Bronze Age fairytales, in that case, ok God promised them the land), there is no denial that all Jewish groups have some sort of genetic connection to the Levant. 

While ""Palestinian"" is a new-ish ethnic label, the local Arab Palestinians are no invaders but Arabised remnants of the local populations. 

Now, in my honest opinion, if Palestinians had the guns and international support the Israelis had, they would not hesitate for a single second to do the same thing to them. Israelis are not inherently evil and Palestinians pure or vice versa, it's just that the balance of power and PR is in their favour and has been for a while. There is no ""inherently evil European colonialist"". 

Who are the Palestinians to blame for their demise? The current Israeli government? Sure, many of them are brainwashed to the core. But who should they blame first? Their own forefathers that sold the land? The Ottoman government that allowed the Zionists to settle? Their own leadership which is corrupt? 

If the Palestinians want ""their"" land back, they have to get it by the sword. Easy in theory. The whole ""from the river to the sea"" thing is just propaganda to rally the masses. But the underlying legitimacy is only gained by force. 

To counter this, it is obviously pure nonsense ny Zionists to say that God gave them the land and expect the Palestinians to give them sweets on arrival. Even if the Jews have a genetic link to the land, that gives them 0 right to get it back, unless they get it by force (which they did). In that case, it has nothing to do with the whole promised land shtick.

To end, it amuses me to see Western leftists defend to the bone the ""indigenous right"" of some  ""indigenous"" people to a piece of land. In this case they're only described as ""indigenous"" because they were ""one with nature"" or had no leader, or because they were there just before the Europeans came. Why doesn't anyone tell the Navajos to go back to Canada? Or the Nahuatl to stop the Inca Empire? 

It is like when the Samis are often described as the ""only indigenous people of Europe"". Are they indigenous just because they lived in huts and look remotely Mongolian? Even though they probably settled there after the Germanic people? 

Why aren't the Polish indigenous? Or the Albanians? Should we give back the whole of Iberia to the Basque? 

These types of thought processes are rightfully rejected as bullshit and childlish whenever we see them from the Balkans. We reject them as memes, as a rightful object of mockery. How can these Albanians pretend they're Illyrian, they're all mixed lol, primitive Balkaners.

If a remotely brown people group lays claim to a piece of land, not only they are immediately accepted, the type of blood and soil jingoism rejected in the Balkans is made into dogma, inscribed in a ""post-colonial"" school of thought in reputed Western academia.

1m5ukdm,"CMV: Christians, based on their own teachings, should lean left politically.","This is based on a few verses.

First of which (and the strongest pointer, in my opinion) would be the Parable of Sheep and Goats. Jesus is essentially saying that the treatment of the lowest in society should be of the same quality as the treatment we would give to Jesus himself, and we would be rewarded with eternal glory. Neglect of the lowest in society is the same as neglecting Jesus, and, thus, you should burn in eternal damnation. 

Then there's Proverbs 30:8-9. ""Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me, lest I be full and deny you and say, “Who is the Lord?” or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God."" It seems like they are saying that we should only take what we need, and we should provide for those who have need. It, certainly, seems to show a distaste for those who live in luxury while others suffer.

1 Corinthians 10:24, ""Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor"" This seems to be stating that we should provide for others and others will provide for us. 

Deuteronomy 14:28-29, ""At the end of every three years you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in the same year and lay it up within your towns. And the Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance with you, and the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your towns, shall come and eat and be filled, that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands that you do."" AKA you should feed those who you owe nothing to and you will rewarded. 

1 Corinthians 12:26 ""If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together."" We exist as a collective, and should only suffer if it is together, and work together towards a common good. 

James 5:1-20 ""Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days. Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, are crying out against you, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter"" 

I think you get the point. The Bible oftentimes points to this idea of working towards a greater good regardless of personal reward or suffering. I feel like this is very in line with my personal ideals (to be brief, Libertarian Socialist) of providing welfare to those in need and providing tools for the people who are down on their luck to pull themselves up with. Additionally, I believe that these verses strongly frown on those that see somebody suffering and kind of shrug and say, ""not my problem,"" as many right-wing people would say about welfare issues, as well as frowning on people who hoard wealth in general.

I guess, to change my views you would need to show that A) the left does not actually align itself to the passages stated (and there are more that I left unstated) B) that the ideals above are not actually contradicted by right-wing policies C) that I am misinterpreting the verses above, and the more reasonable interpretation aligns more with right-wing policies or D) IDK, if I knew all the ways I could change my opinion, I wouldn't be here.

1m5xlfs,CMV: Most complaints from older women about feeling “invisible” to society are simply beautiful women experiencing the natural process of aging.,"I remember watching the first season of the Golden Bachelor with my gf at the time and listening to the different female contestants on the show talking about their experiences as women “past their pretty years” and how they feel society ignores them. But not just them, I work in a  career field with a lot of women and I’ve overheard scattered bits and pieces from others women discussing similar problems. 

If you’ll allow me to paraphrase a somewhat famous aphorism that goes “To those with privilege, equality often feels like injustice”, I feel like that’s very applicable here. Older women, like women in general, deal with a lot of poor treatment from men who don’t respect or understand the aging process. And historically men’s investment in women they’re not related to decreases in proportion to their age and attractiveness. 

But the experience of being unseen isn’t  unique among older women nor would I argue is it even the objectively worst part of dating. To put it crudely, these women had the luxury of being one of the prettiest people in the room from their childhood to at least their mid 40’s. Now, they’re starting to get treated like the rest of us average folk, men and women alike. 

That’s not unfairness that’s just a leveling of the fields. Compare that with the experience of average men/women as they age. They start out not getting noticed and then as they age, they get truly invisible. It’s even worse for the ugly ones. Men don’t care and women still have the threat of sexual assault hanging over their heads for the rest of their lives so they’re even less likely to see or try and see those men either.

Strange, ugly men weeping or looking sad in the streets attract less sympathy on the whole then any lady. It’s why it’s far more common for homeless women to receive help and *not* be seen on the streets as opposed to homeless men. 

As a final point, I’d just say that the women who feel invisible aren’t invisible in the ways average people are. They’re invisible relative to a beautiful girl half their age in the same room, but relative to their generation and age group, they’re still beautiful and have access to a form of pretty privilege that average or ugly seniors can/will never have.

1m6y4el,"CMV: The modern conservative movement in the US can be accurately, not hyperbolically, described as fascist","When I describe the modern conservative movement, a lot of it will have to do with Trump and his movement, MAGA, which maintains widespread support among conservatives and controls much of the country right now, so saying ""I'm a conservative and I disagree with these things"" won't really change my view. 

Trump and MAGA are a near perfect example of a modern fascist movement. Trump rose to power on a wave of populism, attacking the elites who he viewed as effeminate and targeting masculinity and traditional values. Immigrants are scapegoated, viewed as a tool of these elites, brought to the country as part of their efforts to destroy the US. 

Conservatives have embraced autocracy and believe that the only way to defeat these elites is by empowering Trump as a sort of benevolent dictator, who will do whatever it takes, including violating laws and the constitution and human rights, to bring us back to a mythologized past where ""the real Americans"", Trump's supporters, MAGA, maintain a sort of special status. There's a strong and well documented cult of personality surrounding Trump, where conservatives will completely change their claimed ideals and beliefs depending on what Trump is doing at the time. 

Trump is against the constitution, frequently violating the constitution to target freedom of speech, imprisoning immigrants for writing op eds he doesn't like, using executive orders to try to change the constitution through executive overreach, deporting US citizens. He's effectively turning the country into a police state where anyone can be stopped, detained, and imprisoned at any time for any reason without warrant or cause. In response to protests in LA, he took control of the state national guard and deployed the military on US soil, against states rights, against the wishes of the state and city, and his administration has said that the military will stay until they oust the democratically elected state and city governments. 

Trump has become obsessed with expansionism and protectionism, is strongly illiberal, opposed to democracy, tried to overturn one election, pardoned convicted seditionists that violently tried to help him seize power, and has created an uneasy alliance between extremist militia groups and other extremists, Christian fundamentalists, and traditional elites. He tries to exert strong personal control over basically every aspect of the country and the economy, personally threatening corporate elites unless they demonstrate loyalty (Zuckerberg, Musk, etc.), threatening political opposition with imprisonment, stripped citizenship, and deportation, targeting and threatening journalists for writing about his administration, targeting lawyers who defend clients against his administration, and on and on. 

What I've described here is an ideology that's called fascism. I'm saying that Trump is a fascist, and his supporters are falling for fascism. I'm not exaggerating or using it as simply an insult, I understand what fascism is. Fascism doesn't mean ""killed 11 million people,"" such a definition would suggest that Franco and Mussolini and even Hitler, prior to the final solution, were not fascists. It does not mean ""literally Hitler"". Pointing out that though Trump is dismantling due process in the US and sending people to foreign concentration camps where they'll be tortured, but hey, at least they're not gas chambers, isn't a refutation. 

I'm talking about generally understood historical facts of fascism, the common elements of fascism, which Trump and his movement share. This isn't partisan hyperbole, people from all over the political spectrum acknowledge that Trump is a fascist. Conservatives who oppose Trump acknowledge he's a fascist. Well respected generals who worked with Trump directly have said that he's a fascist. Historians who quite literally wrote the book on fascism are calling Trump a fascist. The fascists know Trump is a fascist and support him, and the anti fascists know Trump is a fascist and oppose him. 

But for some reason, there's this weird group in the middle that demands that we walk on eggshells, that we should *never* use the word fascist, even to accurately describe a fascist movement. If you just don't like the word fascist for whatever reason, fine, we can call it a far right extremist ideology that's strongly illiberal, opposed to the concept of human rights and limited government, authoritarian in nature, and oppressive, and all the other shared pieces. That's fine. But it doesn't change the fact that we're talking about, that this movement is fascist, that this is what people post WW2 spent decades trying to understand and prevent from happening again, because it is intensely harmful. 

I think that a lot of people who have trouble accepting this first, don't actually know what fascism is, and think that fascism means ""killed 11 million people,"" or ""literally Hitler"", or it's just an insult. Secondly, many know that fascism is *bad*, this is deeply ingrained in them, but... They like what fascism *is*, they like what Trump is doing, so, they can't acknowledge that they're supporting or defending fascism. 

For some other views you can dive into as a bit of a side component, Trump and the modern conservative movement are opposed to the fundamental values that the country was formed to protect. Trump has gotten people so riled up and scared about immigrants through dehumanization and demonization, that his supporters are willing to dismantle our basic human rights as long as we keep harming them. Not just undocumented immigrants either, Trump is targeting immigrants who legally came to the country, who broke no laws. He's targeting children born in the US, who are US citizens, and wants to deport them to countries they've never been to. He's sending people to brutal, inhumane concentration camps in El Salvador and Sudan without due process and completely needlessly, and many of these people were legally in the US when imprisoned. Most have never been convicted of a crime. 

All of this is very, very bad. Human rights are important. People have forgotten these things. They've forgotten things we swore we wouldn't forget. Like, for example, that a fascist may be going after a group that does not include you now, but that will expand, and you yourself may find yourself sent to the concentration camps. Your rights will be violated. Even the early supporters of fascism found themselves purged, murdered, exiled, etc. 

Whether or not you're willing to call this fascism I consider rather unimportant. What Trump is doing is harmful. We know it's harmful. We've seen it play out over and over again. The benevolent dictator is something of a myth. He might be hurting the people you want him to hurt now, but fascists are always making enemies. 

Some other points: telling me I've been ""watching too much MSNBC"" isn't going to change my view. I don't watch MSNBC, and attacking every journalist or news source that says something negative, but true, isn't a good refutation of anything. 

The statements of fact I've made, like that Trump is targeting legal immigrants and refugees and political opposition and journalists and lawyers and that he tried to overturn an election and pardoned convicted seditionists, these are facts. They happened, regardless of what news sources you watch.

1m728ok,CMV: Polyamory Is Inherently Unhealthier Than Monogamy,"To be clear, I am not saying that Polyamory can't work, or that specific cases with specific people can't have better results with Polyamory compared to Monogamy. But I see Healthy Polygamy as the exception. As a whole, I do not support Polyamory and I do not think others should either.

First off, the fact that every discussion about Polyamory revolves around needing to be careful, and everyone requiring a specific mindset for it is itself a sign that Polyamory is riskier. Things like, ""As long as everyone is communicating properly,"" or ""as long as everyone is there for the right reasons"" are persistent in discussions about Polyamory. These warnings would not exist if Polyamory was as healthy as Monogamy.   
  
Another thing people discuss is how both Monogamous and Polyamorous relationships can be equally as unhealthy and abusive, so Polyamory is not riskier. But I completely disagree. There aren't issues a Monogamous Relationship has that a Polyamorous one doesn't, but a Monogamous relationship does not have the issues that come about from openly dating. Polyamorous relationships naturally attract people like thrill seekers and people who want a lack of commitment. By allowing multiple people into groups, the likelihood you are exposed to someone with an unhealthy lifestyle or with an ulterior motive is just naturally higher, because the freedom of the system means it can be abused easier. Monogamous relationships always have the same set boundaries to prevent this.

I've also seen people claim that poly relationships have fixed their jealousy, and that it is wrong that people in monogamous relationships have normalized jealousy. But what they've really done is develop coping mechanisms to suppress their natural jealousy instead of actually fixing issues. In a poly relationship, jealousy is seen as an individual's problem, that they need to fix their own hurt ego, and not an inherent problem of the entire system. This is a particularly powerful weapon that abusers can use, as someone's imbalanced treatment in the group can simply be labeled as jealousy or an ego issue, and waved off.

Alongside that, a poly relationship means that when it doesn't work, the fallout is worse. Because now your entire group is gone, you are not just breaking up with one person, it is an entire group of people. That also means that in abusive polyamorous relationships, it is not just one person with a power imbalance, but potentially an entire group. This makes it so an overall abusive group has even better access at abusing individual members.

Many of these issues simply do not exist in monogamous relationships, or even have their own alternatives. It's becoming more popular for Polyamory to be seen as perfectly healthy, yet the people who claim that always add on messages about having to put in the work to be secure and healthy. But when this obvious contradiction is pointed out, they suddenly backpedal and say that Poly relationships aren't riskier despite clearly needing more work to function than a monogamous one.

1m7dy75,"CMV: Even if there’s definitive proof Trump is a pedophile via Epstein files, it won’t change MAGA or GOP support for him.","Here’s my reasoning: Republicans didn’t change course after countless mass shootings, even when kids were killed in classrooms. They’ve shown that no level of tragedy or moral outrage will make them abandon their positions if it threatens their political power.

So, I don’t see why concrete proof of Trump being a pedophile would make a difference. His base is fiercely loyal, and GOP leadership has a track record of closing ranks instead of holding him accountable.

My view is that, at most, a few moderates might peel off, but overall, his support would remain largely intact, and the Republican Party wouldn’t dump him. The culture war narrative would just spin it as a “deep state setup” or an attack by the left, like everything else.

1m7el3r,CMV: Trump is the exact reason why both the left and right should hate the rich and the fact they can’t even unite for this shows how hopeless America is.,"I am never going t forget the older white gentleman I saw at a Home Depot with a red shirt that said “Trump is a scab.” Amongst his population, I’m not too sure the sentiment is too common but it provides a clear reason why blue collar workers and hard working Americans should despise Trump. From a more conservative standpoint, there really is no reason to so much as trust Trump, nevermind support him. If he was going to release files concerning Epstein, it’s strange to think he would not do so in a way that saves his reputation. If he wasn’t, then obviously he had something to hide. But in neither case can you reasonably look at the man and see a human being who contains a normal amount of disgust for something like predating women. 

Additionally nowhere in his life has he seemed especially concerned with what even he probably considers to be flyover country. Southerners voting for the most egregious example of a New York Yankees with nothing but a dollar on his mind shows a level of desperation that if peeled back should reveal an absolute lack of reasoning for supporting trump. Conservatives used to despise the wealthy and bureaucrat alike because they both come in suit and tie speaking a legalese to take away or redress a simpler and conservative way of life. 

The reasons the left should hate trump are more obvious but I’d like to point out that this is hard to deny and yet Americans continue to insist on differences that, being the sole focus of political activity, will continue to fracture American society. We have before us the dumbest president in American history and people are either being dishonest about his ineptitude though still dissatisfied with him or completely aware of it and speaking out about it. This latter group does not seem to be doing anything to unite with others however. There will be no progress in America without unity and despite having a blatant cause for unity, people are still not pursuing it. Therefore it is highly unlikely America will truly become great or even much better in the near future. 

We also have ai which is wildly unpopular until you speak to capitalist and liberals who think it will be just like any other form of technology. 

You have men and women apparently both experiencing a loneliness epidemic but every time a man speaks up about their frustrations, it’s just the patriarchy and men need to deal with it themselves

You have rampant poverty and joblessness or low wage work yet people are too exhausted or overworked to unionize, strike, or quit their job. 

You have social media and really all forms of mass media and even art delivering the same empty message about the joys of consuming while pursuing new experiences. This is even common on the left. Hell, the appeal of traditionalism on the right is also veneered in the richness of a change in pace and a different lifestyle. Christopher Lasch once said “We’re all revolutionaries now, addicts of change. “ This is the perfect example of that. 

Whole lot of people think they want a traditional lifestyle but will get bored and even annoyed with their kids. Doesn’t mean kids or a simple lifestyle is the problem, however. It means we have lost and continue witnessing an erosion of our capacity for simplicity. 

Essentially there is not much of any real cause for hope in America. A lot of things can happen and I do still have hope but it m in part making this post because I’d genuinely like to have my mind at least a little changed about the hopelessness of all of this. Americans just don’t seem to be able to get along anymore nor to even share a common hope for the country.

2) The customs, arts, social institutions, and achievements of a particular nation, people, or other social group.

Here's a few examples of cultural American forces that have dominated Europe over the past half century:

1) Movies. not just the industry based in hollywood, but Thomas Edison made commercial film a possibility within the US, later to be replicated by cultures around the world.

2) Nearly all popular music genres within the past 50+ years. Jazz, Rock, Rap, Pop, even Reggaeton since Puerto Rico is part of the US. All of these genres were created by Americans and later replicated by other cultures around the world.

3) Blue jeans. One of the most common articles of clothing across the world, extremely versatile piece of clothing.

4) Government institutions. Our founding constitution created a foundation for many other modern democracies around the world to model their laws around.

If they are, so what? Israel is clearly dominating this ""war"" and destroying Hamas on all fronts, Hamas pretty much stands no chance and is fighting for survival now. Israel is much more funded and powerful than Hamas could ever be. How could this money they generate from selling food even fund them further? They can't get more weapons into Gaza, what's wrong with ""giving Hamas money"" if Israel plans on killing every Hamas member anyways?

I don't see how Hamas getting more money could skew this ""war"" towards them in any way possible - it's just a bullshit excuse Israel is using to starve Palestinians.

This might be unpopular but I don't think the people who spread that meme around were ever centrists to begin with. 

See I'm not ignorant to how mean and judgy leftists can be. Infighting is extremely common for a reason. We all have a lot of conviction in our beliefs and some of us tend to interpret different viewpoints as opposing viewpoints. But that's not what I'm talking about here. Because I've had many shitty arguments with self proclaimed leftists and never once has it encouraged me to take on conservative beliefs. 

I genuinely can't imagine the kind of person who has such little moral fiber that they'd reactively change their beliefs at the first instance of pushback. Hell even after many instances of pushback. Leftists love to debate, so you'd also get many reasonable and compelling arguments from them, even if it's 90% vitriol. It'd be one thing if they just doubled down, but these people are saying they changed their beliefs in opposition to the people they were arguing with. It's hard to believe a legitimately open minded person would only absorb from this experience that 'leftist bad.'

And then you take into account the flaming vile words and actions taken by the right. How did hearing 'jews will not replace us.' on national TV not push you to the left then? Did you really never get into a heated argument with a conservative? I've been called slurs a vast number of times, both online and irl, just for arguing with conservatives. And while that specifically isn't a universal experience, the level of vitriol coming from them too great to deny. 

I think most everyone, if not everyone who claims they were a centrist till some leftists pushed them to the right, were actually right wingers the entire time, larping as an enlightened centrist until their right wing beliefs got called out and they doubled down.

1mcat6d,CMV: The USA is in an Inescapable Death Spiral,"We are in a political death spiral in the USA, there is no mechanism that can stop it.

Back in the day, the parties were looser ideologically. Politics were divided along regional as well as party lines. The consequences of this weren't always great (the Solid South enabling Jim Crow) but they did enable compromise. That's no longer the case, as the parties are now wholly constituted based on their ideologies.

The results of this has been legislative deadlock. Congress can barely pass anything. Once rare measure like the filibuster are now employed routinely. Look at the recent BBB- it had to be passed via budget reconciliation to get around the filibuster. There is no longer any political cost to dirty tricks (think Merrick Garland), and no advantage in compromise.

And so we come to the death spiral. With the legislature useless, both parties have been ceding more and more power to the executive. The stakes for who controls the presidency are now existential. With the precedent of the criminal prosecutions of Donald Trump and this new talk of the DOJ prosecuting Obama, there's a sense that, if a president loses control, they could now face jail or worse. This ""lawfare"" disincentivizes the incumbent from peacefully giving up power. I can't think of a better way to speedrun the death spiral.

1mcggli,"CMV: Despite Trump, Europe has a much grimmer future than Asia or North America.","I've tried hard to love Europe and want it to succeed but I see no clear path to it ever overcoming collapse (before people say yEah bUt eUorpE iS 27+ cOuNtRieS) im talking about every single one collectively especially the ones with Euro as their currency and the larger theme of the continent itself.

Europeans love mocking America and ive seen how bad it is getting there Trump, guns, fast food but we never look inward. Europe faces the worse problems, just hidden better and somewhat even in denial. Aging populations, deindustrialization, and policies that punish the young with sky-high taxes, unaffordable housing, and zero real growth. The experience of being a young person in europe is completely different from the glamourous tourism people outside of it think, i’ve yet to meet a single Gen-Z European who’s genuinely optimistic about their future, any talented european that gets an oppurtunity still moves to UAE or US despite critisizing them, its almost hypocrytical.

Germany shut down its last nuclear plants during an energy crisis, most of europe is riddled with green hypocrisy and net-zero laws that have punished the young by shifting jobs elsewhere. The UK is collapsing. France is politically gridlocked and bleeding talent, even skilled youth are fleeing abroad. But these are just symptoms.

* Real wages (esp PPP adjusted) in China’s urban regions are now catching up to and in some cases surpassing Southern and Eastern Europe.
* Germany, has negative real wage growth and rising living costs. Half of Germans reportedly have less than €1,000 in savings.
* Italy’s youth unemployment is above 20%. Spain’s isn’t much better. Entire generations are locked out of home ownership and capital accumulation, it offers nothing more than being a vacation spot.
* Pension and healthcare systems are unsustainable, with shrinking workforces forced to support massive aging populations.
* Tax burdens on the working-age population are brutal, especially for those who want to start a business, invest, or build anything new.
* There is an increase in anti-free speach and censorship across europe sometimes in worse ways than america, im not fear mongering like JD Vance but the actual publications by the EU and the UK's new online safety act.
* It is a region of various languages, internel divide (even within its own countries) so it will never be united against common problems.

It is cliche, even a meme to suggest or say the US and China are racing ahead in AI, semiconductors, biotech, and deep tech. Europes startup founders are some of the most miserable ive see and are always just looking to find their comapny then flee to the US or Middle East where they are treated better. US, China and even India manufacture the EVs, solar panels, and servers europeans will depend on while contributing little back and only get poorer.

India, Vietnam, and even Indonesia are leapfrogging Europe in digital infrastructure, fintech, and manufacturing investment. While europe will head nowhere.

And before anyone jumps in with “but Trump”, yes, the US has its dysfunctions. But the US still has a clear path to course-correct. Presidents change. Policy swings happen. Beneath all the noise, America’s industrial base is real, it still builds planes, chips, AI models, biotech, rockets. It has deep capital markets, global reserve currency status, and still attracts the world’s top talent still lives to go towards US salaries. europe's problems are far more structural.

1mcnslq,CMV: Conservatives strongly overestimate Democrat loyalty to their elected officials,"My reasoning: Ever since the Epstein files came out and Trump had been accused of being on them, the immediate retort from MAGA conservatives is “Clinton was there too+mentions of Obama, Biden, Hilary, etc.”

1. Anyone who was born after 1980ish ( so anyone roughly younger than 50) just doesn’t  care about Clinton mainly because he didn’t impact their lives in ways they can likely recall. Left-leaning people of this generation are more familiar with someone like Obama.

2. While liberals may have the rep of “blue no matter who”, as someone who has been left-leaning their whole life, one of the most frustrating things about the group is how hyper critical they are. In the previous election, my personal theory is Kamala lost due to not being “radical” enough and being constantly criticized by the left base for not being left enough. Everyone’s entitled to their own theories, but I just say this as an example that candidates aren’t just worshipped blindly by left leaning people, and are seen more as a better alternative to their agenda. In other words, they didn’t just accept her(or anyone’s) candidacy without criticism after.

3. On another point, liberals are socially famous for “cancelling” people. Right or wrong, this also applies to politicians too. All it takes is someone saying the wrong thing and it’s “so you support x issue ?” Or “they didn’t post about x so they must hate x community”. In other words, left leaning loyalties are brittle and easily broken. AOC, as a more recent example, is heavily criticized for not voting the way her constituents want.

3. Democrats don’t take it personally when you insult democrat leaders, including Obama. In fact, I’d wager if you asked a sample of Obama voters their opinion on him now, a good chunk of them would say something akin to “I liked him, but he didn’t do enough or yeah he’s just like other politicians.” Meanwhile, any direct criticism of Trump draws out his supporters as if they had been personally attacked. No one is losing sleep over Biden or Clinton going to jail. 

All this to say, if your response to the E.F. Is” Well what about Clinton” , I promise you nobody on this side cares. Bill or Hilary. Obama might get more of a reaction but I promise no one’s gonna try to overthrow the government or stay loyal if any or all of them are implicated.

There was genuine revolutionary furvor among large swaths of white America, so much so that they started to form local political coalitions with black communities with the explicit intent of destroying the war effort, in spite of many of them supporting Jim Crow just a few years earlier. Nixon made great haste to end the war to remove this pressure, and also hit his base with the classic ""silent majority"" line to bolster their racial fears and anxieties they had *just* started to overcome. This lead to a breaking of the fragile, barely formed ""rainbow coalition"" which stood to undermine the whole system if it had fully coalesced. With white people shoved back into cultural isolation, Nixon acolytes began to build a propaganda machine custom built to keep them scared shitless of their children and their neighbors.

1mdyofz,CMV: The killing of Corporate Executives (or other wealthy elites) is a facet of class warfare equivalent or lesser than cutting critical services.,"**This is not a post advocating for violence.**

Recently Wesley LePatner, an executive for Blackstone who oversaw a $53 billion dollar real-estate investment fund, was killed by an armed shooter. This attack was less clearly motivated than the killing of healthcare executive Brian Thomson. However it does mark the 2nd high profile executive that was killed in recent memory. 

Currently in the United States, the bottom 50% of households hold less than 4% of the national wealth. A significant portion of which is held by the top of that 50%, because many people towards the bottom of that range have less than nothing, just debt. Many of these people rely on social services like Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, just to survive. 

It's not an exaggeration to say that many of these people's lives are held at the mercy of wealthy individuals' whims. So when someone like Brian Thompson makes a policy choice that he knows will lead to thousands of people to be denied potential life saving medical care, or a real-estate mogul raises rent for the 5th consecutive time knowing families will be homeless, they are aware that their actions will kill people. 

I don't see how the targeted killing of individuals with this kind of power is fundamentally different than someone knowingly taking their lives. The only true difference is that the wealthy elite uses a policy change instead of a gun, and is protected by a few layers of separation. In the end though, both parties are making choices with the full knowledge that it will kill or ruin someone's life.

I'd even argue that many policy chocies made by the elite are worse comparatively, due to the scope of harm caused. Things like cuts to USAID or the NIH will touch the lives of exponentially more people than any individual murder.

1meh8rd,"CMV: “My Body, My Choice” Is a Terrible Argument for Pro-Choice When Addressing Pro-Life Audiences","CMV: I think “my body, my choice” is one of the worst arguments a pro-choice person can use when speaking to someone who is pro-life. I’m not saying it is morally wrong to believe in bodily autonomy, or that abortion should or shouldn’t be legal. I’m saying that if the goal is to engage with people who hold pro-life beliefs and actually change their minds, this slogan completely misses the point of where they are coming from.

Here’s why. Many people who are pro-life sincerely believe that abortion is equivalent to taking a human life. In their eyes, the fetus is not just part of your body, it is a separate, developing human being with its own moral status and right to life. You can disagree with that view, but you cannot ignore it if you want to actually persuade them. When you say “my body, my choice,” what they hear is something like “I have the right to end another human life because it’s inconvenient for me.” That’s not a strawman, that’s genuinely how many of them interpret the argument.

Imagine if someone said “my house, my rules” as a justification for killing a 14-year-old who lived with them. That would be horrifying, right? To many pro-life people, the fetus is no different than a child. They see it as vulnerable, innocent, and in need of protection. Saying “my body, my choice” to them sounds no better than “my life, my choice” in defense of harming someone else who is dependent on you.

This doesn’t mean the pro-choice position is invalid. But if the objective is persuasion or productive discussion, this argument fails hard. It refuses to engage with the actual moral premise of the pro-life position. And because of that, it comes across as dismissive, selfish, and disconnected from the core issue. Instead of fostering dialogue, it creates a wall.

So CMV: If your goal is to actually reach pro-life people and not just preach to those who already agree with you, “my body, my choice” is not just ineffective, it’s counterproductive. You cannot change someone’s mind if you refuse to address the thing they care about most.

Having said that, all you have to really know about communism as an system of government is that its leaders were compelled to build a wall to prevent their own citizens from fleeing to lands governed by their political rivals. 

And not just in Berlin either, all communist countries required their people to obtain exit visas in order to visit other countries. What does that tell you?

What’s more thousands of people, many of whom were among the most talented and productive members of communist countries, defected to capitalism, while only a handful of people went the other way.

I am not writing this to excuse the crimes and inequities of market based economies, I am just saying that a system of government which prioritizes the abolition of private property and enterprise cannot exist along side countries where the acquisition of wealth and property is limitless. The latter system will always be more attractive to the most creative and ambitious individuals.

That said, if they are to exercise that right, then they DO believe in censorship and do NOT believe totally in ""free speech"". I need to clarify here that I'm aware that true ""free speech"", as bestowed by the first amendment, means not being imprisoned by the government for what you had to say but does not protect you from being, say, banned from a subreddit and doesn't protect you from citizens policing their own conversations. But I think we can at least agree that there's some understanding of a form of ""free speech"" that deals with allowing any and all opinions to be expressed and heard everywhere, across the board, no matter how much other people like those, and I think conservatives are very familiar with this interpretation of ""free speech"".

And so, in their own most important space, since they are exercising their abilities to silence other people and shut down conversations they don't like, they should stop acting like censorship is some awful thing and that they are the true proponents and advocates of free speech.

1mfu0yn,"CMV: Islam isn't the ""obvious truth""","In every conversation i've seen among muslims, they say that the truth in islam is obvious and incontestable. They always act like every kafir secretly knows that islam is the truth, but kafirs still deny it so that they can commit forbidden acts like :listening to musical instruments, having a conversation with the opposite gender, wearing gold jewellery and traditional clothes (like cheongsam or sarees), investing in financial products that give interest etc.. this isn't even the full extent of it. 

Islam can be easily disproven:

1. The quran says that earth was made before the stars.
2. The quran describes embryology in a scientifically inaccurate way.
3. The quran says that semen originates in the spine.
4. The quran says that the sun revolves around the earth.
5. Jannat is an everlasting оrgу with 72 virgins for all men, including those who died as kids. What's interesting is that these virgins have regenerating hymens, and skin so pale that you can see their bone marrow. A real god won't make the ultimate reward so hedonistic and pоrnоgrарhic. If you search up the full description of houris, it's an absurdly hilarious list of fetishes. 
6. Quran rejects the science of evolution. You have to watch [this](https://youtu.be/lqk3TKuGNBA?si=gGP2ZQRRKJ-zJweN) 7 minute video before you try to debate this. Evolution isn't a theory, it's an observable fact. Both micro and macro evolution have been repeatedly observed and documented by scientists. Evolution ""by natural selection"", ""by genetic drift"", ""by sexual selection"" are what's labelled __theories__ , as they provide the explanatory framework around the fact of evolution. NASA defines life as ""a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution"". A lot of muslims try to rationalize this by saying that ""i believe in evolution of animals, but not humans"". Honey, humans are also animals. Humans are mammals, and mammals are animals.
7. Mohammed was a PDFile who married a 6 year old. A real god would want his army of believers to protect the innocence of children. Muslims believe that the age of accountability is 15 but the age of marriage can be 6? Excuse me what? 

You need an insane amount of mental gymnastics, blind faith, glorification of suffering, and zero inherent sense of morality to believe in islam. You need to import your morality from a 7th century book, be in denial of science, motivated by the lust for imaginary virgins. This is far from what you can reasonably call ""the objective truth"". This is why apostasy is punished with death in sharia law (according to all 4 sunni maddhabs), because they need to shield themselves from criticism of ex-muslims to avoid their logic from falling apart.

1mfxy10,CMV: Islamophobia has made it impossible to criticize Islam in a normal & non-bigoted way.,"I’m taking specifically about the West. 

Right wingers want all Muslims to die and leftists don’t accept any kind of critique against Islam in general. You tell someone on the right that you’re not a huge fan of Islam’s apostasy laws and they’ll tell you with a straight face that they’re all terrorists. You tell someone on the left that some of Islam’s laws on warfare (like the one about prisoners of war) are morally questionable, and they’ll try to shift the conversation to Christianity, criticism against which they’ll readily accept and talk at great lengths.

Christianity in the West is a great example of a religion we can now criticize in a normal, rational, un-bigoted way in the West. That’s because there’s hardly such a thing called “Christianophobia” in the West, and thank God. In fact I think Christianity is dissected in the West in such a scientific, anthropological way that I think is so fascinating. I think the way everyone regardless of their religious beliefs (or lack thereof, in the majority of cases) felt comfortable tuning in and talking about this year’s Conclave goes to show how normalized rational, non-bigoted discussion and critique of Christianity is in the West. 

Because of Islamophobia, popular discussion about Islam in the West has only ever fallen under two categories: bigotry or blind defense. 

Obviously Islamophobia has caused a surge in irrational hatred and bigotry from the right against Muslims, that we all know, but an unintended consequence of this that people don’t really talk about is how the Western Left seems to have in many ways either blatantly defended the indefensible or become intolerant towards any critiques against Islam to kind of absorb or “balance” all of the hatred coming from the Right.

This leaves very little space for people to interact or engage with Islam in a normal, rational, non-bigoted, non-biased, and non-censored space. I feel like there exists no “centrist” space for a conversation like this, or maybe it’s just that centrists aren’t loud enough about their opinions on Islam as the right and left (I don’t really know if centrists are really loud enough about anything, coming from a leftist). You’re either fully Islamophobic or don’t think Islam’s problems should be discussed whatsoever. 

Like are there normal people who have normal thoughts about Islam? Like there are some pretty good things in there too. Bad stuff as well. Like can we just be normal? Some nasheeds are genuinely so fire. Maybe let’s not advocate for killing Ex-Muslims though. Is it that hard to have a conversation like this? 

TLDR:
Me: Islamic apostasy laws are kinda crazy I’m ngl
Right wingers: That’s why I don’t have any sympathy for the children in Gaza. Israel should finish the job.

Me: Islam allowing governments to hold prisoners of war for ransom is lowkey insane 
Leftists: What about Christianity? Let’s talk about Christianity. You’re Islamophobic.

1mfz11b,CMV: a man is never wrong for seeking a paternity test for a child presumed to be his,"4% of children born in the United States have legal fathers who incorrectly believe the child is theirs biologically. Not men who weren't sure or who suspected the child may not be theirs, but men who were confident that they were.

4% is 1 in 25. I'm in medical school, and I've learned about congenital conditions that are 1.5 in 1000 in prevalence that are considered common. Every single child born in the United States is tested for a number of conditions at birth that are 1 in 10,000+ in frequency. SCID, which is 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 in incidence, is one of them. No one argues that it's irrational or a waste of money to test for exceedingly rare medical conditions, because we correctly recognize that some conditions, no matter how rare, are serious enough to necessitate universal screening.

From the perspective of a man, how serious is misattributed paternity? How massive of a financial and emotional responsibility is it to be the father of a child?

1 in 25 isn't rare at all. It's extremely common. How do I know? Because **Cystic Fibrosis carrier status is also 1 in 25 in prevalence in European populations, and it's considered very common**. 1 in 25 is many of the people you know. It's many of the people who will read this post. It's 300 million people worldwide. The unfortunate truth is that many men misplace their trust because a lot of people are good at pretending to be trustworthy.

Given the prevalence of misattributed paternity, the fact that we consider it rational to test for things that are far less common, and the massive financial and emotional responsibility a man takes on as the father of a child, I think it's perfectly reasonable for a man to test whether or not he is actually the father of a child if he ever feels inclined to do so.",Wooden_Guest_6911,1014,0.6600000262260437,2348,1754162869,2025-08-02 14:27:49,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1mfz11b/cmv_a_man_is_never_wrong_for_seeking_a_paternity/,8,2025
1mg1egx,"CMV: sabrina carpenter is not for the ""girls and the gays"", and her marketing is largely based around men.","okay, hi! the controversy around sabrina carpenter's new album cover inspired me to make this post, and i'll mostly be talking about the sudden switch in her marketing/brand since Nonsense. i'd like to start of by saying that you can argue whether being male centred is good or not, but that's not exactly my point, my point is merely proving that her brand IS male centred, and not for the ""girls and the gays"".

Wikipedia defines the male gaze as the act of depicting women and the world in the visual arts and in literature from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as sexual objects for the pleasure of the heterosexual male viewer.   
  
1. The nonsense outros: all are about men. all of them. all of them are oversexualised. they centre men. it's sexual humour, but all of it centres men. how big he is, et cetera et cetera. moreover, the sexualise outros aren't empowering or subversive either. they're marketable, specifically to the men that she is singing to. it's not empowering because there's less about her sexuality as it is, and more about how her sexuality profits men. which imo makes it obvious that the nonsense outros specifically are male centred. 

  
2. the man's best friend cover (original): while she is the centre of the cover, i'd like to argue that she is the centre of the cover in a voyeuristic way. once again, it's a man's action that is highlighted, i.e, the pulling of her hair. her action, kneeling, is AGAIN in service to the man's action. the title compares her to a dog, direct objectification. how is that not male gazey? 

\-the inside of the vinyl, side A (if i'm not wrong): is once again, her being displayed for a man, she's on a bed, her hands holding the headboard (passive), while a man touches her leg. once again, it's sexualised, but it's not for a woman's pleasure, it's the man who is controlling the situation.



3. Manchild: the only single that's been released off of the album, is once again talking about a man who's problematic, and once again features her centring her life around such problematic men. ""i swear they choose me, i'm not choosing them"" even as a joke, is her being passive. 

  
4. the tracklist for man's best friend: 

1. Tears
2. My Man On Willpower 
3. Sugar Talking
4. We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night
5. Nobody’s Son
6. Never Getting Laid
7. When Did You Get Hot?
8. Go Go Juice
9. Don’t Worry I’ll Make You Worry
10. House Tour
11. Goodbye

and 6 of these titles are very obviously about men, even though they're not released. 

  
5. the short and sweet tracklist: 

1. Taste
2. Please Please Please
3. Good Graces
4. Sharpest Tool
5. Coincidence
6. Bed Chem
7. Espresso
8. Dumb & Poetic
9. Slim Pickins
10. Juno
11. Lie To Girls
12. Don’t Smile

11/12 of these are about men. if we argue espresso isn't about men, that makes it 10/12 songs.

these are all the points i could think off the top of my head. i don't see how someone could look at these examples and then claim that her marketing is for the ""girls and the gays"", just because she had one video where she was depicted as having no outfits for men, and an outfit for the girls and the gays. thank you for reading if you did!

But I believe the way “protecting children” is being used today is more about justifying sweeping censorship and surveillance, rather than genuinely addressing harm.

* **Age verification laws** (like the SCREEN Act orthe UK's OSA) are being pushed under the guise of child protection, but they often require invasive data collection, full ID scans, and expand surveillance across the internet.
* **Payment processors** (Visa/Mastercard) have pressured platforms to remove entire categories of content, including legal adult games or art, supposedly for “child safety”  despite those platforms already being 18+.
* **App store rules, government regulations, and media moral panics** increasingly shape the internet into something sanitized, corporatized, and moderated to the point of erasing queer art, sexual education, and counterculture voices — all in the name of “protecting kids.”
* Meanwhile, **actual predators** in powerful positions (like those associated with Jeffrey Epstein) have faced almost zero consequences. His client list remains sealed.

1mjgc2t,CMV: Israel is committing a genocide,"In this post, I will be using the definition of genocide as posed by the UN, as it is the most widely accepted. Additionally, it is not merely a line in the sand, but one that carries significant legal implications. It asserts that genocide consists of ""any of the following acts committed **with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group**, as such:

* Killing members of the group;
* Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
* Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
* Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
* Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

 \[13\] 

It only takes **one** of these to constitute a genocide, but I think Israel's actions can be described by the first four (as was argued in the ICJ). While the genocidal acts themselves are important, far more important (and harder to prove) is the intent with which they are committed. This will be the focus of my post.

I should note that I will be referencing the ICJ hearing on this genocide many times, and each time I will provide a link to the timestamp, as South Africa’s argument was over 3 hours long

The IDF's destruction of Gaza has been so systematic and total that it can only be explained by an intent to destroy, in part, the population of Gaza based on their being Palestinian. The goal is not simply to overthrow Hamas, but to collectively punish all the people in Gaza through bloodshed. 

As of July 30th, the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 60,000 at least. \[1\] That is 3% of the total population of pre-war Gaza, and it is almost certainly an underestimate. An article in the Lancet published January 10th found that this same estimate was underreported by 41% \[2\]. Of the dead, roughly 51% are women, children, or elderly \[1\].  An additional more than 140,000 have been injured. \[1\]

Around 90% of the population of Gaza has been displaced, fleeing for their lives \[1\], but even those who managed to escape to “safe zones” are targets. In fact, Nir Dinar, spokesperson for the IDF, has said publicly that “there are no safe zones.”\[4\] During the ICJ court hearing, which took place just 97 days into the now nearly 2-year-long conflict, it was stated that Israel had dropped 2,000-pound bombs on designated safe zones at least 200 times. \[5\]

The injured increasingly have nowhere to go, as Israel has targeted hospitals and healthcare facilities time and time again. According to Doctors Without Borders, “Currently, no healthcare facility in Gaza is able to handle the large flow of wounded people.” \[12\] On May 22, the WHO had recorded 697 attacks on health care since the conflict had started. They reported that only 19 of an original 36 hospitals remained operational, and that 94% were damaged or destroyed. “The destruction is systematic.” \[11\] 

Healthcare is far from the only essential service the people of Gaza have been deprived of. 96% of households report moderate to severe water insecurity, and 81% have reported poor food consumption. Household might be an inaccurate term, however, because 92% of housing has either been destroyed or damaged. \[1\] 1 in 5 children is acutely malnourished, and that is likely an underestimate. \[15\] This is consistent with the intentions of Yoav Gallant, who called for a “complete siege of Gaza,” because they are fighting “Human animals”.  \[14\] 

After international outrage, Israel has opened up new corridors for aid in Gaza; before then, there were three routes for aid into Gaza’s (original) 2.1 million people. \[18\] Compounding the issue, these shipments are often successfully blocked or destroyed by far-right “activists.” \[17\] The aid that does get through is severely limited by Israeli restrictions. \[19\] This is after Israel blocked all aid into Gaza for 3 months, despite the ongoing humanitarian crisis. \[22\] The journey to this limited aid is also extremely dangerous; from May 27th to August 1st, at least 1,373 people were killed while attempting to receive food. \[20\] Here is an aid truck arriving in Gaza.\[21\] This was within the first 100 days of the conflict.

As argued in the ICJ, these genocidal acts are “rooted in the belief that in fact the enemy is not just the military wing of Hamas or indeed Hamas generally but is embedded in the fabric of Palestinian life in Gaza.” \[7\] Ruthie Blum, former advisor to Netanyahu, has written that “It’s time to dispel the myth that Gaza is filled with innocent civilians.”\[8\] President Isaac Herzog has stated, “This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it's absolutely not true.” \[10\*\] Itamar Ben-Givir, Minister of Security, has stated, “When we say that Hamas should be destroyed, it also means those who celebrate, those who support, and those who hand out candy. They are all terrorists, and they should also be destroyed.” \[16\] If no one is innocent, what is to be done? Nassim Vaturi, deputy speaker of parliament, has called for “erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the Earth.” \[9\] The goal may be to stop Hamas, but in the minds of many Israeli leaders, all Palestinians in Gaza are Hamas.

The genocidal destruction of a group “in part” is established when the part targeted is “significant enough to have an impact on the group as a whole.” \[23\] It is hard to argue that the mass starvation, bombing, and displacement haven’t resulted in the whole of the Palestinian people being deeply affected. October 7th was horrific, but it doesn’t have to be unprovoked to become genocide. In fact, the UN’s definition makes clear that genocide can occur in the context of armed conflict.  \[13\]  What matters is if all people belonging to a group are being targeted, without discretion for their military importance. Were those fleeing to safe zones or traveling to receive aid of military importance? Hamas may be using human shields, but according to Article 51 of the Geneva Convention, the use of human shields does not release the opposing party of their obligation to avoid civilian casualties. \[24\] 

In the past 670 days, the IDF has systematically annihilated all semblance of a Palestinian society in Gaza. They bomb people's homes and the “safe” zones to which they flee. They destroyed hospitals and cut off the aid that the surviving hospitals desperately need. They have starved the people of Gaza and killed them as they clamor for food. They have repaid the mass deaths on October 7th 50 times over, and there is no end in sight. This is all backed up by the genocidal rhetoric of top Israeli officials, who show no signs of stopping. At a point, the mass deaths of civilians aren’t collateral damage; they’re the intention.

1mjiznh,CMV: A Christian “grooming gang” scandal in a Muslim majority nation-state would provoke a far more violent reaction from its public then anywhere in the West.,"To be clear, I don’t think this is a problem for Muslims in the West, broadly speaking. But outside the West: in countries like Indonesia, Egypt, Syria, Nigeria and Iraq the response would be much uglier. Because as much as pick-me leftist academics and progressives like to pretend otherwise, majority Muslim countries are far less tolerant of their religious minorities then anywhere in the West. Now add that to the resentment of colonialism and the stagnation of their countries, mix in the ever-present regulation of muslim women’s bodies and sexuality and we get a powder keg. 

What would be liable to light the fuse on that keg? Oh I don’t know, how about a series of stories on the abduction/rape of Muslim girls by western, white Christian men who assumed all Arab women were hot blooded harlots? 

There would be mass protests in the street, the Egyptian version of Fox News would be ranting about how kafirs are trying to steal their women and turn them Christian, which in turn plays into the victim psychology that plagues much of the Muslim world when it comes to the west. The feeling that secular, non-Arab, un-Islamic ideas are leaching into your society and subverting it intentionally. 

This would lead to violence in my opinion because, when you look at the Arab spring for example, it doesn’t take much for Muslim majorities to go after their minorities. In the Arab Spring case in Egypt, it wasn’t even anything their Christians did that caused the explosion of violent attacks against them. It was simple hatred by radicals who had been waiting for an opportunity to strike. Imagine if they’d been accused of what the men in grooming gangs did. 

I can guarantee no Muslim majority country would have covered it up the way sections of the British government did for fear of being labeled “islamophobic” ",soozerain,1671,0.7799999713897705,445,1754519760,2025-08-06 17:36:00,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1mjiznh/cmv_a_christian_grooming_gang_scandal_in_a_muslim/,8,2025
1mkeeaa,CMV: Boomer’s have compromised America’s future more than any other generation.,"Not trying to start a flame war, but I’ve been thinking about the long-term direction of the US and how much influence the Boomer generation has had on it. Is it fair to say they’ve done more harm than good to the country’s future?

A few things stand out:

1. Economic policy and inequality
From the late 70s onward, many Boomers in power embraced deregulation, tax cuts for the wealthy, and privatization. These choices helped erode the middle class and concentrate wealth at the top.

2. Housing
Boomers bought homes when prices were low, then used zoning laws and NIMBY attitudes to restrict new development. Now younger generations are stuck with sky-high housing costs and no easy path to ownership.

3. Entitlements and debt
Boomers are collecting the biggest benefits from Social Security and Medicare, but the systems weren’t adequately prepared for long-term sustainability. The financial burden is shifting to younger workers.

4. Environmental inaction
Despite early environmental wins, real action on climate change was delayed or avoided. Short-term economic interests often came first, and now younger generations are facing the consequences.

5. Political gridlock
As Boomers took over leadership, trust in institutions fell and partisanship increased. Congress became less effective, and culture wars took center stage instead of policy solutions.

Of course, not all Boomers are responsible. Many pushed for reform, and plenty are just regular people doing their best. But as a generation, they held a lot of power for a long time. Is it fair to say they’ve left the country in worse shape?

1mlv6wc,CMV: The West Would Have Allowed the Holocaust If Nazi Germany Had Limited Territorial Expansion to Poland and Czechoslovakia,"As much as the international community likes to grandstand as if being anti-genocidal is a ""Western value,"" what they are doing now is precisely what they would have done during the years of the Holocaust. I believe that if Nazi Germany had stopped its territorial expansion (lebensraum) at Poland and Czechoslovakia and focused solely on implementing the Holocaust within those territories, the Western world would have largely stood by and allowed it to happen. My view is based on three key historical factors that demonstrate Western indifference to Jewish persecution and genocide in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

# Argument 1: Genocide Was Not a New Concept, Especially Not for Germany

# Historical Evidence (I hope you see a pattern here)

**Herero and Namaqua Genocide (1904-1908)**

* Perpetrated by German colonial forces in German South-West Africa (now Namibia). Estimated 65,000-100,000 Herero and 10,000 Nama people were killed.

**Greek Genocide (1914-1923)**

* Systematic killing of Greek populations in the Ottoman Empire. Estimated 450,000-750,000 Greek civilians were killed. Occurred alongside the Armenian Genocide

**Various Colonial Genocides**

* The murder of Native Americans during the colonization of North America over centuries. California Indian Wars and massacres (1850s-1870s). Tasmanian Aboriginal genocide (1824-1832).

This short list of examples demonstrates that systematic extermination of ethnic and religious groups was not unprecedented before the Holocaust, yet international intervention remained minimal or nonexistent in most cases.

# Argument 2: Western War Exhaustion and Isolationism After WWI

The impact of World War I created a negative desire in many nations to avoid military conflict at almost any cost.

# American Isolationism:

* **Opposition to War**: During the 1930s, the combination of the Great Depression and the memory of tragic losses in World War I contributed to pushing American public opinion and policy toward isolationism. Isolationists advocated non-involvement in European and Asian conflicts and non-entanglement in international politics.

# French Weakness:

* **Political Instability**: France, in particular, was politically weak in this period, experiencing 16 coalition governments through the 1930s.

# Argument 3: Antisemitism in Western Countries

Antisemitism was at extremely high levels throughout the world during the 1930s and early 1940s

# United States:

* **The Polls**: Antisemitism in the United States was also proven in national public opinion polls taken from the mid nineteen thirties to the late nineteen forties.
* **American Antisemitism**: Father Charles Coughlin, a Catholic radio preacher increasingly attacked ""the Jews"" after 1936... Coughlin's newspaper, Social Justice, reached a circulation of 800,000 at its peak in 1937, and his weekly radio program drew between 5 and 12 million listeners in the late 1930s.
* **Opposition**: Just five percent of Americans in 1938 were in favor of ""allowing German, Austrian, and other political refugees to come into the United States.""

# United Kingdom:

* **Barriers**: A law was enacted in the 1930s to ensure that no more than 5% of the total students in a school were Jewish, limiting the rate at which Jewish children could be admitted to state schools.
* **Refugee Hostility**: The press, which was generally not supportive of refugees, incorrectly reported that there were more Jews in Britain than had been in Germany in the summer of 1938.

# Conclusion

The Western world's has never been anti genocide, it would be more honest to say genocide was more of a western value/tradition more than anything. The entry into WWII was motivated by Nazi territorial aggression threatening their own security interests, not by opposition to the Holocaust itself.

We are only living in the future where the Western world is given praise for helping stop the Nazis because the perfect conditions were met for real action to take place. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened if Japan never attacked Japan or Germany never attacked the Soviet Union. 

Look at America and Europe today; look how easily Nazis became mainstream again. No amount of grandstanding should make anyone forget how long nations stood by knowing everything Germany did, or how much work the everyday people had to put in to get their governments to care.

1mlz2nm,CMV: Most companies could pay their workers higher wages like Costco does but they simply choose not tom,"People often say higher wages aren’t realistic for most businesses and I don’t buy it. Costco proves it's possible. They start people off at a higher wage, give them benefits, and the place still makes money hand over fist. 

People say other businesses can't because they have a different model than Costco does. Okay... and? They are free to change their model, they just choose not to.

Defending other businesses for not paying better wages is a bad argument because those companies are absolutely free to structure their company however they want. 

Note - An argument of ""well they serve a lower income population who can't pay membership benefits"" isn't valid here. The business is *choosing* to serve that population. They're not forced to.

1mlz88o,"CMV: Democrats don’t win because their message is unclear, inconsistent, and overly conciliatory.","Point 1: Their message is unclear. 

I don’t vote Republican, but I understand what they’re trying to sell me. Talking points like “the wall,” “no more pointless wars,” and “lower taxes for the middle class” are spoken on repeat in terms that everyone can understand. Even if these promises are lies, they are completely unambiguous. It’s kind of to his advantage that Donald Trump speaks like a 12 year old because ordinary people are able to understand him. I’ve watched some NYC street interviews about the upcoming mayoral election, and it’s clear that voters are uninformed and don’t have a firm grasp on the issues. 

On the other hand, Democrats talk about a hodgepodge of different issues and seem to highlight the least concrete of them. In the last campaign, the issues that seemed to be discussed the most were abortion and democracy. The end of democracy, though plausible, feels like a distant reality for a lot of people. Abortion isn’t an aspect of life that most people experience every day. They hear about wars in the Middle East, feel the burden of rising prices, and experience the challenges that our broken immigration system has brought every day. 

Point 2: Their message is inconsistent. 

The reason why I think that the message is inscrutable is because of inconsistencies in what the party values. For Republicans, they’ll fall in line eventually, even if they’re not jn 100% agreement with the candidate. For Democrats, every issue is a dealbreaker for somebody. Not pro-Palestine? Stay home. Not pro-universal healthcare? Stay home. Not anti gun? Stay home. And in terms of leadership, we have seen Democrats try to sabotage people like Bernie, AOC, and Mamdami. There a very few issues that can be confidently raised to the forefront because there is so much irreconcilable division within the party. 

Point 3: Their message is overly conciliatory. 

The message becomes unclear because of Democrats’ need to be conciliatory in addressing inconsistencies in opinion. As an example, some voters really care about culture war issues. Some care more about other issues. But to placate those whose dealbreaker is culture war issues, the Democrats either (a) vaguely take stances or (b) don’t take stances at all. In simple terms, they don’t want to offend anyone, so they usually don’t take resolute stances on issues. 

There are a multitude of other reasons why Democrats don’t win, but I think these are the major reasons why voters are not responding.

1mn3jdv,CMV: Republicans do not understand that the democratic base has zero interest in halting the release of the Epstein files to protect democratic leadership or donors who could be in them.,"So this happened: [https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/politics/vance-epstein-democrats](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/politics/vance-epstein-democrats)

Now, let me start by saying that it is plausible to me that democratic party leadership slow rolled the release of the files during the Biden years when they should have pursued the release aggressively. This may well have been to protect high ranking democratic officials.

Frankly, as a progressive, I find this deeply shitty and I have no interest whatsoever in protecting the people who did that. I don't care how many Ds they have next to their names, and I don't care if it means we lose every election from now until the crack of doom. If it turns out the entire party was in on Epstein's child trafficking operations, I want that information public. 

I don't want to be represented by someone who was a part of that vile group of monsters. And I have not encountered a single Democrat (outside of, possibly, party leaders) who want that. There is a certain level of shittiness we democrat leaning voters will put up with in our representatives, I will not debate that, but someone representing us in government after literally enslaving children to be raped repeatedly by the highest bidder? 

Yeah, that's just way, \*way\* too far beyond the pale. 

But it does seem like at least the republican leadership sees our attempts to get the files released as an attempt to root out their people and protect our own. Which allows them to feel morally justified in protecting their own child predators in party leadership.

They do not seem to understand that we are not interested in protecting our leaders. We know revealing this information might remove key members of our coalition and make our party more disorganized and rudderless. We do not care. 

But I get the sense that a lot of republicans \*think\* we care. Possibly because they don't care how evil \*their\* reps are. Perhaps they and would defend their leadership no matter what horrors they covered up, so they assume the democrats would do the same. To me it seems the most likely explanation.

To change my view, please let me know if republicans like Vance don't actually think democrats are unwilling to purge their own. I could see a world where statements like this are designed to get sound bites for their base to hear on Fox News or something and are pure bluster.   
  
You could also provide me with an alternative explanation for accusations like this showing up.    
  
Or, you could let me know if there is a similar divide between republican leadership and their base. Perhaps we are all in the same boat here and kicking everyone out who rapes children is a point of unity in our divided nation.

Anyway. 

People always jump and blame the current president (I’m talking about in general, not just DJT) for how poorly everything is in our country, but what about the people behind the curtain? The people who actually CREATE the bills? The people who are supposed to be OUR VOICE? The people who ACTUALLY have the power of our country? 

Change my mind. Convince me that ripping off the curtain and revealing the Great Wizards of Congress for who they really are- selfish, power hungry people- wouldn’t benefit our country in a positive way.

1mp0z4v,CMV: Identity Politics have been the most damaging idea to modern politics and  political discourse,"Disclaimer beforehand: one’s identity and its relation to politics are important and it is true, especially now in the US, that certain identities are increasingly being attacked and persecuted. I empathise with minorities currently being harassed, threatened, or worse. I do not discount their experiences; my problem lies more in the fact that identity has been the sole dominating aspect of political discussion. I believe this has harmed minorities more than it has helped them.


To begin, what do I mean with identity politics? Identity politics constitutes the idea that one’s politics and identity are inherently intertwined, e.g. one’s race, sexual orientation, gender, ethnicity etc. either mostly or wholly determines one’s political view. In some sense, there’s a slight truth to this. After all, one’s identity influences their political choices and the issues that are relevant to them. The problem, however, lies in the type of dogmatic fundamentalist identity politics that emerged from latter half of the 2010’s in which identity exclusively influences politics. 


I believe this idea and hardline political tone has severely damaged modern western politics, especially so in the U.S. The problem with identity politics is that it shifts the mechanisms of politics from ideology and opinion towards something fundamental and unchangeable. Someone can change their political ideology, but changing one’s race or sexual orientation (mostly) is not possible. If these identities fatalistically determine politics, it leads to very dogmatic and increasingly radical politics, which we have seen in the US. 


Rather than the more fiscal tone dominating politics, it has, for a while, dominantly been about one’s race, gender, orientation, etc. Although well-intended, this has led to racial reactionary groups - which used to be fringe - to lead counter-movements based solely on race. I believe this, in part, directly led to the radical branch of MAGA-republicanism which thrives on exploiting racial and identitarian discourse.


I understand that race has inevitably played a part in politics, segregation and institutional discrimination is a problem and has caused systemic issues for minorities. I, however, don’t think the hardline identitarian discourse has helped these minorities in any way. In fact, I believe it has only led to worse circumstances and hard pushback. It has politicised what should’ve been basic and universal human rights. I believe this hardline conservative-authoritarian pushback exists for the most part due to this toxic identitarian initiated discourse by progressives.


It’s an uncomfortable truth that when the majority of the US - a demographic that is white, straight, and male - is demonised to such extend and a clear ‘ingroup’ and ‘outgroup’ exists, that this majority votes not based on policy but group/identity affiliation. Where we should have made progress based on economy and human rights, we have regressed in both. 


Last but not least, identity politics also has served to oversimplify the truth and caricaturise the Left. For example, it came as a complete surprise that Latin men have been a substantial voter base of Trump this election, because identity politics has mistakenly assumed that one’s identity and ‘ingroup’ is its inherent voting base, leading to mistakes in campaigning and tone, losing more voters. I also believe that a significant part of voters who didn’t vote for Harris, didn’t do so because they have imagined the Democratic side to be affiliated with identity politics (and in a way they have) and due to the mechanisms of identity politics, they have opted as the ‘outgroup’ not to vote for the side that has pushed them away and ignored kitchen table issues.

1mpcsa3,CMV: Not liking ghetto/ratchet culture is not the same thing as being racist or classist,"I come from an area of NY that is pretty damn mixed. I have multiple interracial (white/black and white/latino) marriages within my family, and to this day my absolute best friends are a very mixed group. So I don’t wanna hear the I’m racist nonsense meant to shut down a conversation rather than engage in it

I absolutely despise this proud to be ghetto, unashamedly ratchet in public, Idgaf attitude in today’s culture that, unfortunately from what I see, seems to be widespread in black communities. I think it does so much harm to those communities to embrace it and does not help race relations in the slightest


People will say it’s a poverty issue. I’m sorry, I flat out reject that. You don’t need money to act in a respectful manner. You don’t have to be the most educated person to move throughout the world with a sense of modesty and politeness. Rich people can act trashy as well. It’s a culture thing above all else

Whenever I bring this up I just get with “you’re racist”… meanwhile I’m absolutely infatuated and have  tremendous respect for Jim Crow era black America. The fact that they endured so much injustice while remaining godly, intact family units, well educated, and contributed so much to the arts ( fuck yeah blues music), it just makes me sad to see what is happening the last few decades

 I personally blame the media and the glorification of hustle rappers glorifying the lifestyle. That’s who they are shown, that’s the role model image for too many and parents are failing these kids by either taking part in themselves or not doing enough to curb it

1mpjmow,"CMV: The ""recycling is a scam"" narrative is a harmful faux-progressive American myth","There is a very popular narrative in the US nowadays that ""recycling is a scam/myth/fake"", which is promoted by citing that plastic recycling is uneconomical and that companies are actually to blame for waste rather than consumers. This is all only partly-true and lacking important context.    
  
The most obvious problem with this narrative is it usually conflates plastic recycling with recycling as a whole. Even if plastic recycling were entirely not worth doing, recycling of cardboard/paper, glass, and metal are all much more efficient and sustainable. Some of you might argue that most people don't actually conflate the two and are just talking about plastic recycling specifically, but if necessary I can cite many, MANY, hit tweets where people conflate the two. I would go as far as to say that most people who reference this topic make no distinction.

Next, the notion that recycling is not worth doing because most ends up in landfill anyway also has a number of problems with it. One is that it assumes the majority of recycled waste needs to be effectively recycled in order to make the practice of recycling worth doing at all, but the bigger problem is that it's not universally true and instead reflects an Americentric frame of reference that is used to make a broad statement about recycling as a whole without making any effort to discern *why* the \[American\] recycling sorting process is so inefficient. Most other developed countries actually have significantly higher recycling rates than the US. Most other developed countries have multiple different recycling bins for different types of recyclable waste, but this is too much for Americans so they mostly just use single-stream recycling where all the different types are mixed together then sorted later at the recycling plant. This is obviously much less efficient, but what makes it so much worse is that even with the most simplified system possible the average American still can't be bother to put any effort into sorting their waste. Almost any time I see a public trash and recycling bins next to each other I will look inside to see almost no distinction between their contents. The janitor at a school my friend used to work at would just throw all the school's recycling in the dumpster for no reason other than that he was too lazy to keep them separate. Americans who move to foreign countries like Japan often experience culture shock over how much more complicated their personal waste sorting is and how much personal responsibility they are expected to take for it. The uncomfortable truth is this: American recycling being inefficient is not primarily a systemic problem, but a cultural problem tied to American hyper-individualism. When people promote the ""recycling is a scam"" narrative they just make the problem worse by giving people justification to reinforce negligent practices.

Inb4 I know some of you are going to bring up that consumer product companies have promoted recycling in an attempt to shift blame for waste onto consumers, but that does nothing to refute the viability of recycling as a practice. We can regulate corporations while also practicing socially responsible waste management, it's not a binary.",Xiphactinus14,685,0.8100000023841858,262,1755126172,2025-08-13 18:02:52,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1mpjmow/cmv_the_recycling_is_a_scam_narrative_is_a/,8,2025
1msci03,CMV: Putting low price limits on death row inmates' last meals defeats the point of offering one.,"So when someone is scheduled to be executed, they're usually given a last meal consisting of whatever they request. Unsurprisingly, this is often things like seafood, steak, or other expensive meals. 

I'm largely talking about the US here (I don't know other countries' death penalty laws/traditions), but several states have imposed restrictions on this last meal, with some states doing away with it completely, and some imposing limits as low as $20-$25. 

Practically, I understand the reason for imposing some restrictions, (such as food that can be purchased locally and reasonable substitutions if the specific food the inmate requested isn't available, or even a significantly higher price limit) but if you're going to offer someone the kindness of a last meal, limiting them to such an incredibly low price means that there's a high chance they won't be able to get what they want. You can barely order a meal from a fast food place that comes to less than $20, much less a real meal. (Especially if you live in a place with sales tax.)

(Full transparency, I don't even necessarily believe in the death penalty to begin with, I just recognize it as a trait of the society we live in, and therefore still have opinions about how it's implemented.)",ChocolateCake16,1243,0.9200000166893004,327,1755389864,2025-08-16 19:17:44,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1msci03/cmv_putting_low_price_limits_on_death_row_inmates/,8,2025

1mu8d6k,CMV: Trump and MAGA have poisoned the political well and America may never recover,"This isn’t a unique take by any means, but I want to have something to hope for so I hope someone goes for it.

Currently, I see a country with 2 parties: one that relentlessly preserves the status quo of a declining empire, trying to maintain stability at all cost while the cracks are spreading. A party that doesn’t have good answers for many of the systemic issues are country is facing - political corruption, declining infrastructure and education, homelessness and drug use epidemic, and of course widening income inequality where the zoomers (me) are saddled with debt while boomers own $1 million + homes that they’ll sell above asking price. This party, like the rest of the countries politics, are captured by older (age 50+) voters that will not suffer the consequences of the issues and policies enacted today. This party also alway chooses to go high, that inaction is better than bad action, and that now is the time for passivity in the face of radicalism- this is the democrat party of 2025.

Then, there’s the opposition party. Opposition to what? To the status quo. So is it opposition to themselves if they win? No contradiction is possible because it was always the dems fault. It is a united front of negativity - motivated by defeating their opposition, the democrats, by any means possible. There are no values, principles, or truth - as long as you are white, Christian and above all: hate the democrats. It is more important to follow the leader, the president, than it is to hold party members accountable to objective reality. Instead, they have made it a daily ritual through their news networks to propagate fake news because although the news is fake, the feelings that they can instill with it is not. Stripping minorities and vulnerable groups of rights more than makes up for the pain and suffering inflicted on one self. This is the GOP in 2025, they would nuke the country themselves if it owned the libs.

And now we see the GOP in complete control of government, rapidly eroding liberal and independents trust in institutions faster than Fox News & Conservative radio were able to erode republican trust over the last 40 years. It feels like the US is approaching the end of the road, that things are in motion that cannot be undone.

It’s hard to believe that even if Trump disappeared tomorrow, that the damage he has wrought on the US by alienating its allies and causing mass instability won’t be felt for centuries. It is so demoralizing as a young person living now, that the world that we grew up in will be safer and happier than the one we will see for the rest of our lives.

So how do we go back? How do we undo the decades of minding poisoning that conservative media has done, separating rationality from tribal group think that has allowed this Orange buffoon to sell out our country to any and everyone who’ll buy a piece?

Converting to Islam means following Arab culture and leaving your own culture.

That's what happened to non Arabs.

Iranians left Zoroastrian culture.
Turks left Tengrism culture.
Ancestors of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis left Hindu culture.

To follow Islam, they started following many things from Arab culture and started abandoning many things from their own culture.

All muslims around the world have to pray in Arabic, do greetings in Arabic, many of them non Arabs even want to dress in an Arab way to look more muslim.

It means...When a non Arab converts to Islam, the Arabs gain a lot and non Arabs lose a lot.

A cultural gain for Arabs (non Arabs will follow Arab culture), and a cultural loss for non Arabs (they'll leave their own culture because they'll automatically believe Arab culture is superior).

So when a non Arab fights for Islam, he's indirectly fighting for an Arab culture, not for his own.

As a result, the non Arab convert starts looking a lot like a wannabe Arab.

Add to all this Trump's 'joke' based on the fact that Ukraine has been unable to hold elections since 2019, “So you say, during the war, you can’t have elections,” Trump responded. “Say, three and a half years from now — so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections. I wonder what the fake news would say about that?” ( [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-live-updates-rcna225477/rcrd86684?canonicalCard=true](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-live-updates-rcna225477/rcrd86684?canonicalCard=true) ) and the actions he's been taking to normalize the use of military force on American soil, like the activation of the National Guard and the Marines in California, the federalization of the DC police force, the activation of the National Guard in DC, and the proposal to send the National Guard into other American cities like Chicago and New York. 

These actions combined make the movement of the USS Gravely, the USS Jason Dunham, and the USS Sampson to the coast of Venezuela, along with his authorization to deploy US troops into Mexico ( [https://youtu.be/povVuY6L6pA](https://youtu.be/povVuY6L6pA) ) to ""fight the cartels"", which could spark a war with Mexico if done without the Mexican President's permission, permission that she has already said multiple time she will never give, seem like the first step in sparking a war with one or both countries as 2028 gets closer in an effort to then use that as an excuse to try and stall or cancel the elections.

1mzwbxo,CMV: It is awkward to not know the language of a country you lived in for 4 decades,"Basically, im not trying to insult or hurt anyone but this is genuinely what I feel about my parents and I wished someone could convince me that Im wrong. My mom first came here (a country in the middle east) when she was a teen, and my dad came when he was in his 20's. They were here for 40 consecutive years and they still make the silliest mistakes in the language. I get that Arabic is very hard and Im not expecting them to be fluent, but it is embarrassing how they prefer to talk like how the foreigns talk in here (broken Arabic) even though they can speak better than that, they are just afraid of making mistakes. I try to correct them kindly but they don't like to correct themselves. They like to make others think we dont speak Arabic so that they don't talk to us in an advanced level of Arabic. I speak fluently, and some of my siblings speak fluently. But my older siblings are just like parents, even though they were born here. I don't understand why they are all bad in Arabic. 

  
When I try to teach them indirectly (by talking to them only in Arabic at home), I get tired. Because I have to translate and explain everything. My dad is very interested in improving his English (he is not fluent but trying is good), and I wonder why doesn't he do the same for Arabic. 

  
I understand that learning a whole new language at such age is not easy. If I went to a foreign country now, I wouldn't be able to speak like the locals ever. But the embarrassing part is having the foundation (writing and basic vocabulary and reading) and hearing and reading the language for 40 years and still speaking poorly.

I swear I saw so many foreigns that spoke Arabic much better than my parents and they had known Arabic for less than 2 years. Obviously I never told my parents I feel this way about them but I wished they would change and put an effort into learning.

1n037ej,CMV: Dems are less likely to associate with Reps because they don’t view politics as a team sport,"So, one thing I think a lot of us have seen since the election is that several Republican voters are complaining about how their Democratic friends have cut them out of their lives. “Oh, how could you let so many years of friendship go to waste over politics?”, they say. And [research has shown](https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/#:~:text=Importantly%2C%20Republicans%20have%20more%20bipartisan%20friendships%20than%20Democrats%20do.%20A%20majority%20%2853%20percent%29%20of%20Republicans%20say%20they%20have%20at%20least%20some%20friends%20who%20are%20Democrats.%20In%20contrast%2C%20less%20than%20one-third%20%2832%20percent%29%20of%20Democrats%20say%20they%20have%20at%20least%20some%20Republican%20friends.) that Reps are more likely to have Dem friends than vice versa. I think the reason for this has to do with how voters in both parties view politics.

For a lot of Republicans, they view it as a team sport. How many of them say that their main goal is to “trigger the libs?” Hell, Trump based his campaign on seeking revenge and retribution for those who’ve “wronged” him, and his base ate it up. Democrats, meanwhile, are much more likely to recognize that politics is not a game. Sure, they have a team sport mentality too, but it’s not solely based on personal grievances, and is rooted in actual policies.

So, if you’re a legal resident/citizen, but you’re skin is not quite white enough, you could be mistakenly deported, or know somebody who may have been, so it makes perfect sense why you’d want nothing to do with those who elected somebody who was open about his plan for mass deportations. And if you’re on Medicaid or other social programs vital for your survival, you’re well within your right to not want to be friends with somebody who voted for Trump, who [already tried to cut those programs](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/12/18260271/trump-medicaid-social-security-medicare-budget-cuts), so they can’t claim ignorance.

I could give more examples, but I think I’ve made my point. Republicans voters largely think that these are just honest disagreements, while Democratic voters are more likely to realize that these are literally life-or-death situations, and that those who do need to government’s assistance to survive are not w political football. That’s my view, so I look forward to reading the responses.",AlexZedKawa02,1193,0.7699999809265137,1490,1756157159,2025-08-25 16:25:59,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1n037ej/cmv_dems_are_less_likely_to_associate_with_reps/,8,2025
1n17v95,CMV: Neither burning the Koran nor so called 'Islamophobic Speech should be illegal acts in the UK (or any other civilised country),"Let me start by getting a couple of silly caveats out of the way. Obviously, anyone burning a copy of the Koran should only be doing it with a copy that they themselves own. Secondly, it must be under safe and controlled circumstances. 

Dousing a Koran in petrol and throwing into someone's home is an act of Arson, and ought to be prosecuted as such.

However, no matter how offensive any individuals find Koran burning, it should not be illegal. In the last year or so one Koran burner did so, uploading the video to Youtube - with the burner holding some kind of personal connection to a victim of the Manchester Arena bombing (an Islamic extremist terror plot), the other was a Kurdish individual, protesting outside the Turkish embassy. Both of these acts appear to be completely legitimate and reasonable acts of protest.

Now, onto Islamophobic speech. On the one hand, I completely agree that 'being a Muslim' should be a protected class. The implications of this are that if someone fires somebody, refuses to serve someone in a restaurant, or denies someone healthcare, on the basis that the person is Muslim, then this act ought to be prosecuted as being unlawfully prejudiced. However, it is at this line that the specific protections for Islam/Muslim people should be drawn. 

Labour Party UK are supposedly drawing up a definition to allow Islamophobia to be a prosecutable offense. Certain things within their working definition are reasonable, and would apply to any other religion or identity grouping (in effect). For instance, levelling specific threats, harassing, or using slurs against Muslims (or any other individual) would already potentially be covered under laws about harassment and abuse. 

There are however various dangerous ideas within this definition, including things like making links between Islam and terror, discussing the historical spread of Islam via war/invasion (Jihad of the Sword), discussing the link between Islam and grooming gangs, discussing the marriage between Islam's prophet and his child bride.

All of the above are matters of fact, historical record and even appear within Islam's holy texts themselves. How can they be banned or proscribed, as matters of fact?

It is one thing to say that it is illegal to be prejudiced, abuse or hurt to an individual Muslim person, but the idea that nothing hurtful, negative or critical can be said about the institution of Islam itself is patently absurd. 

I suppose much of reddit leans on my side on this, with many atheist and free speech advocates already agreeing with my position anyway, but I do wonder if I have missed something here, and there is a reason that Islam needs this level of protection (or perhaps that it is just the first step towards levelling similar definitions for all religions and identity groups)",8NaanJeremy,1527,0.800000011920929,953,1756269862,2025-08-26 23:44:22,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1n17v95/cmv_neither_burning_the_koran_nor_so_called/,8,2025
1n1muai,CMV: Citizens United vs FEC (2010) was the worst Supreme Court decision of the 21st century.,"While cases like Dobbs v. Jackson (which overturned Roe v. Wade) or Shelby County v. Holder (which gutted the Voting Rights Act) get more attention, I believe Citizens United was uniquely destructive because it reshaped the foundation of American democracy itself. In that ruling, the Court held that corporations and unions have a First Amendment right to spend unlimited money on “independent” political expenditures. The practical effect was the rise of Super PACs, the explosion of outside spending, and the flood of “dark money” into elections. The change is staggering: in the 2008 election (before Citizens United), outside spending was about $300 million and dark money was under $5 million. 

By the 2020 cycle, outside spending had skyrocketed to over $3 billion, with more than $1 billion coming from dark money groups that don’t even have to disclose their donors. 

On top of that, in 2008 the top 100 donors accounted for about 15% of all federal election funding, but by 2020 they provided nearly 70%. In other words, a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals and organizations now dominate American political financing.

What makes Citizens United especially harmful is that it entrenched inequality in political power in a way that cuts across every other issue. Whether you care about healthcare, climate change, reproductive rights, or foreign policy, money now plays an outsized role in determining which voices are heard and which policies move forward. Unlike Dobbs, which can theoretically be addressed through legislation at the state or federal level, Citizens United rests on a constitutional interpretation of free speech that is extremely hard to reverse, it would likely require either a constitutional amendment or a dramatic shift in Court philosophy. That makes its damage enduring.

In my view, Citizens United didn’t just change one area of law, it rewired the entire American political system to be more plutocratic. Other rulings may have had immediate and painful effects, but this one undermines democracy at its root by giving disproportionate power to wealth. That’s why I think it deserves the title of “worst Supreme Court decision of the 21st century.” CMV.",Foreign_Cable_9530,2070,0.949999988079071,801,1756314440,2025-08-27 12:07:20,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1n1muai/cmv_citizens_united_vs_fec_2010_was_the_worst/,8,2025

1n3gl1x,CMV: Implying that a man is gay just because he doesn't find some women attractive is homophobia disguised as trolling.,"A ridiculous trend you see on social media: A man says that he doesn't find a certain woman celebrity attractive. Apparently, this triggers many women (and some men) so much that they feel the need to tell him he ""must be gay"". This is condescension and he implication is that gay men aren't 'man enough' to like women. And these kinds of comments often come from otherwise left-leaning 'allies'. 

So to qualify as a straight man, you are supposed to find every woman attractive ? Are straight women attracted to all men ? If not, do they get told ""they must be lesbian"" ? 

This is a combination of toxic feminism, homophobia and sexism that needs to be unpacked. You do not have to feel offended on the behalf of person B just because a random person C doesn't find them attractive. People are allowed to have preferences. Just because you disagree with them, doesn't mean you get to question their sexuality..

1n4i4ph,CMV: A Palestinian State will likely be a Failed State,"I don’t want to discuss what the morally correct course of action is or what ought to happen according to international law.  
Within the scope of this CMV I solely want to discuss the likelihood of if a Palestinian State would fail soon after independence were it to be made a State today without systemic reforms.

**Problematic leadership policies** – Abbas’ holocaust revisionism and PA stipends to families of terrorists are problematic policies for alleged moderates  
**Economic and infrastructure fragility** – Gaza depends on foreign aid and Israel for all of their essentials while the West Bank is economically intertwined with Israel and would lose jobs and investments if fully independent   
**Authoritarian and factional politics** – Hamas rules Gaza, the PA rules the West Bank, dissent is suppressed, and past conflicts (2007 Hamas–PA split) show violence is a common political tool   
**Corruption and governance weaknesses** – Both governments are widely accused of kleptocracy and mismanagement, undermining trust and state capacity.   
**Societal and human rights challenges** – Women, LGBT, and minorities face poor protections. Children are often taught hostility toward Israel, and public support for armed struggle remains high

I think that a Palestinian state made today will likely become a failed state soon after independence based off of these above factors unless major reforms are made prior to independence.

You can change my view by explaining how the most likely outcome for a Palestinian state is not to be a failed state. Also acceptable is debunking my raised points and explaining how they are either incorrect or irrelevant to my argument.
