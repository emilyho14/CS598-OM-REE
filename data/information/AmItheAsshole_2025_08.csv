1mg38gr,AITA for putting googly eyes on all the food in the fridge to “prevent snacking”?,"My roommate eats everything. I’ll buy a pack of cheese sticks and they’re gone by morning.

I asked nicely, then labeled stuff. No change. So I got creative: I bought a pack of stick-on googly eyes and put them on everything. Milk? Eyes. Leftover spaghetti? Judging you. Even taped one to a banana.

It worked. He said it “creeped him out” and he stopped eating my stuff.

Now he says I’m being passive-aggressive and “creating an emotionally hostile refrigerator.”

1mux4g3,AITA for not changing my daughter's wedding venue even though my sister's husband proposed to his 22-year-old mistress there last month?,"I (51F) put down a $20K non-refundable deposit on this gorgeous beachfront estate for my daughter , let's call her Amy's (26F), wedding next September. We booked it 18 months out. For context, and without revealing too much, it's THE venue in our area, and it has been Amy's dream wedding spot in all of her pinterest boards.

Last month, my sister -- let's call her Carol (48F) -- found out her cheating ex-husband -- let's call him Mark (50M) -- proposed to his coworker (28F) who he had been having an affair with. The woman posted engagement photos from the same venue... Specifically the beautiful beach area where Amy plans to have her ceremony.

Carol is obviously destroyed. She called me sobbing, begging me to change venues. Says she can't watch Amy get married where Mark proposed to a girl younger than his own daughter. Can't smile for photos on THAT beach.

I feel sick for her. I do. But:

* $20K non-refundable deposit
* Save-the-dates already sent
* Amy's dreamed of this venue since high school
* Everything else is booked or 3x the price

I told Carol I can't lose $20K and crush Amy's dreams because Mark is trash. Carol says I'm choosing money over her mental health. That I'm forcing her to relive the worst betrayal of her life for ""pretty pictures.""

I also talked to Amy about it and she does not want a venue change. That it's not her fault Mark -- who has been out of all out lives for the last 5 years -- ruined that place for Carol. Carol called Amy a ""spoiled brat who wouldn't understand real pain.""

Now Carol's skipping Thanksgiving. Half the family says I'm heartless. The place is cursed anyway, why should we host Amy's big day there.

The other half says Carol doesn't get to hijack Amy's wedding because her husband's a cheater.

1n2odkk,AITA - Do not want a service dog to participate in my wedding.,"Throwaway

I'm (28F) am getting married in the spring.  I've asked one of my best friends to be one of my bridesmaids.  She has a service dog for PTSD.  I respect her dog and glad she has it in her life.  My Fiance and I don't particularly care for dogs, and we've decided we don't want her service dog in our photos or in the ceremony.  

When I asked her she got excited and immediately said her dog could wear something to match the rest of the bridesmaids.  Thats when I explained that the dog could come to the wedding, but wouldn't be an active participant in the day.  We don't want it in photos or in the ceremony.  It could go to photos, but not be in them.  It'll be off to the side for the 10-15 minute ceremony.  In preliminary discussions with our photographer we've brought this up. 

She did not take it well.  Called me an asshole and ableist and it was not a constructive conversation after the ask.  She hasn't accepted my offer to be a bridesmaid, but also hasn't declined formally.  AITA?

1mydhz6,AITA for not cancelling our long-planned trip because my MIL scheduled surgery at the same time?,"My husband and I have a big trip planned for 5 weeks from now. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime type of vacation,15 days on the other side of the world, over 27 hours of flights each way. We’ve been planning and saving for it for over 6 months. Both of us work very stressful jobs and very rarely get the chance to take any time off like this.(never did on the last 12years) 

  


My MIL (70) has several health problems. She recently scheduled a complicated surgery for exactly the same time we’ll be away. (She knew we were away) We were not consulted about the timing. There’s almost no other family around, and the few relatives who live about 40 minutes away either don’t drive, have jobs, or simply can’t/won’t help her during recovery.

  


We don’t have the option to reschedule our trip without losing a significant amount of money, and honestly, we suspect she chose these dates partly for attention or to create conflict, there were other possible dates.

  


Now there’s pressure on us to cancel and be there for her, but we feel that after all the time, money, and energy we put into this trip, and how rarely we get breaks, it’s unfair to expect us to change our plans.

One day, I was in the living room. My wife ran in holding her tummy. She slipped and fell. Then she said something like, crap I pooped my pants. 

Everything about it, seemed like a prank she would do. From the double meaning phrase, to the toilet humor, to the physical comedy. Despite the fact that I dislike most of her pranks, I found this one funny. But it wasn't pranking, when I realized, I tried to help her up. She told me not to touch her.

1mvtfit,"AITAH for kicking out my friend's neurodivergent friend, for what I felt was ignoring boundaries and touching my most personal stuff?","I'm just super annoyed that I'm made to be the bad guy but in case I'm missing something, here it is. 

My friends have a buddy (uses pronouns they/them), they bring along who is on the spectrum and high-functioning. They can drive, live independently, clearly make friends, and hold down a job - so personally, I think they can understand and respect boundaries. 

They have this annoying and disgusting habit of burping really hard, effortfully, so it is loud. And I have a sensitive nose and it smells. I don't care they do that but when it's in my literal personal space, less than three feet, that's an issue. 

I told them several times not to do that when they are literally facing me and talking to me, facing me, or eating right next to me, with an entire plate of food being passed around. 

The end of my patience was then met when I had a gathering and they invited them. They (their friend), came in and I was warm to them, then when I go to the bathroom, I come back looking for them to tell them we are eating dinner. Lo and behold they are playing with my hearing aids I put in a device to dry them out since it was raining.  (My friends just speak louder around me when they are off)

I literally need those for work and my safety, and other people playing with, let alone wearing them, is unsanitary. 

I flipped out and told them to put those down and he burped in my face, laughing, saying they was sorry and tried to hug me. They drop one of my hearing aids on the floor and almost spill their drink on it, the puddle barely touching it as I grabbed it. 

These are $3000 each...

I told them to let go and my friends were trying to get me to understand that they has trouble with these social cues. My response was:

  
""I'm allowed to decide what I put up with in my personal space and who handles my medical devces. Anybody who can hold down a job, make friends, and live alone should be able to respect boundaries. I don't care if they're on the spectrum, that doesn't mean anything on this.""

1n03to6,AITA if I don’t clarify that I am a type 2 diabetic?,"I (30F) was diagnosed with TYpe 2 diabetes last year. Thru a program at my job, I can get Dexcom continuous monitors for free as long as I participate. So why not? 

Occasionally, someone will notice it and ask me what it is (because I cover it with a cute patch) and I’ll tell them it’s a Dexcom CGM. 

The people I don’t have to tell? Old people who have Dexcoms and Type 1 diabetics of any age. They see it and know immediately what it is. 

The old people typically don’t know there’s a difference between T1D and T2D but the T1D usually assume I’m also T1D because of my age. 

I recently had someone I see regularly notice my Dexcom and I noticed they seemed more interested in me afterwards. Talking About different things, fav snacks and CGMs, late lunches and feeling shaky, etc. Eventually they asked something about my insulin pump. I clarified that I didn’t have one, they seemed shocked and asked what I do then? I told them I’m pretty well controlled with diet (I made massive changes) and Mounjaro. They then got snide and accused me of being an ahole by misleading them and pretending I was a type 1 diabetic and that I should have clarified that i have the diabetes that I did to myself, which is different than having diabetes done to you like a type 1 diabetic. They are avoiding me now and also pointing out to people that I am type TWO diabetic, not type ONE. 


Now I’m questioning if I’m suppose to explain that I’m type 2 diabetic specifically so that I don’t accidentally end up masquerading as a type 1 diabetic??

So I was planning on putting a privacy fence around my property and it goes right through the memorial site.  Because of the state of it I ended up just clearing it all out and built the fence last year.

1mtzhcw,AITA for not canceling long standing plans for a BBQ that I just found out about?,"My wife and I made plans back in January with a group of friends to go to a beer festival in the mountains. My father in law has a rental property in the mountains which we reserved for the weekend and we all got tickets to the festival. It’s 3 families and some other friends so about 9 people total. 

The festival is Labor Day weekend, and my grandparents invited us and some other family to a barbecue that weekend, but we won’t be able to attend because we’re doing the beer festival. I texted my grandpa and let him know we wouldn’t be able to make it because we already had plans that weekend, and he said he understood and that it was no problem. 

But then my mom texted me asking why we couldn’t come. And I told her why. She told me she’s very disappointed, and that I need to make this barbecue a priority and that I should cancel the plans to go to the beer festival. She then goes on to guilt trip me saying my grandparents are in their 80s and we won’t have many more opportunities to get together. (For context we live in the same state/city as my grandparents and we see them 2-3 times a month minimum.) She told me a beer festival is not a good reason to “blow off” my grandparents and that I need to reconsider my priorities. 

I told her I couldn’t cancel, the house is booked and the tickets are paid for. And I told her that if it was just our family and no friends going that we’d forego the festival and come to the barbecue but that I didn’t think it was fair to our friends to cancel long standing plans for a barbecue that we just found out about, not to mention telling them that they’d either have to eat the cost of the tickets, or find a different place to rent. 

I told my mom that if it was any other weekend, or even Monday of the long weekend instead of Saturday that we’d be there and we aren’t blowing them off, it’s a scheduling conflict but she disagrees and is still very pissed off at me.

1n3gj1x,AITA for changing my mind about my wife being a SAHM since she changed the terms?,"I (35m) have been with my wife Allie (37f) for two years, married for one and we are expecting our first child together in a few months. I also have two children (8m and 6f) from a previous relationship with Alex (32f), and we have 50/50 custody, however, Alex travels a lot for work so we have the kids more than that most of the time, so we get child support from her. 

Before we got married, Allie and I spoke extensively about what we wanted, and she was adamant about being a stay at home mom. I was upfront with her that I was fine with that, we’d be able to afford it, but she would need to be a SAHM for all of the kids to be able to make it work. She agreed happily. 

So as you can probably predict, she sat me down the other day and told me that she wants, at minimum, her first year as a mom to only be a SAHM to our shared baby. She said after that she can help out more with the other kids, but wants to protect her first time motherhood and said it’s her number one boundary. 

I told her that would no longer work, then, I couldn’t support a family of five on just my salary without help with all of the kids. She said I needed to figure it out and respect her boundaries, but this simply won’t be possible. We have family to help for sure but she’s saying she doesn’t want to be responsible for the older kids at all the first year. Also, we want at least one more child and I’m now worried she’ll try to extend the year with another baby.

Okay??? how is that my problem? I’m not her closet. Idk why she doesn't just wear my mom's too.

FIL refuses to do anything himself. Literally whine-screams from the guest room, ""I'M! HUN!GRY!"" and expects MIL to fix him a plate at any hour. He's refused every outing and bonding experience we've tried to make. I got tired of hearing him scream at her from behind closed doors. This time I heard him say, ""No, move that over there. No, put it there. You're so fucking stupid, (MIL's name)!"" He's so used to getting his way and I have HAD IT with his attitude. He's used to throwing his weight around because he's tall and loud. But now he's too old to be loud and he went full Hank-Hill-ass anyway because he almost never gets out of bed (by choice, not because of being disabled, he's just lazy)

  
So I stormed in and yelled at him that he does not treat his wife like this in my house. He tried to say it wasn't my business, but it is my business whenever I can hear it because I'm half-deaf, so it takes a lot.

 He tried to say they've been married for 50 years and ""we work it out our own way"" and I said, ""well you're in my house so its my way or the highway. You do not talk to the person you love like that in my fking house!"" 

  
I was full banshee-screeching at him and frequently over him as he struggled and stumbled with excuses.

  
He'd say shit like he ""didn't say anything wrong"" - ""yes you did, you called her mean names. A good man doesn't call his wife names!"" 

He said ""she WAS being stupid so (he) HAD to"" -, ""no, you made a choice, the WRONG CHOICE IN MY FKING HOUSE!"" 

He would backtrack and lie.  So I asked, ""did you or did you not call her stupid?"" he went off on another ramble about how long they've been married, so I screamed over him, ""YES! OR! NO!"" Until he finally admitted yes. 

I told him that he needed to apologize to her. He said he would ""Talk to her"" privately. I refused and said I needed to hear it because I know behind closed doors he's going to continue disrespecting her. 

He called me a bitch. I told him that if he wants to have a relationship where we all cuss and hurl names at eachother, then he's a fucking pussy who can't man up to his own actions when he's in the wrong. My wife got home and broke it up, then she took a turn screaming vs him too (because she did not like that he called me a bitch for refusing to back down against him).

  
My wife and I sat down with MIL. We told her that if she doesn't actively make steps towards getting home healthcare for FIL that I will be calling APS, assuming adult custodianship of both of them, and sending them to separate care homes. We gave her the choice of whether to divorce or not, but we made it clear we expect her to stop taking care of him herself.

1mguwxz,AITAH for suggesting to my husband that we put his mother in a home?,"I (45f) and my husband (56m) are going through a rough patch. Recently, his mother’s (78f) health issues have been getting worse and the doctor has recommended she receive full time care. Previously, she lived alone, but nurses would come every other day to check on her. My husband thinks the best course of action in moving her into our home. 

My issue is that I do not want my mother in law living with us. She’s always been very rude to me and my daughter (11f). She was originally against me marrying my husband because we come from two different faiths (he’s Morman, I’m raised Lutheran but personally agnostic), and because I’m not as “traditional” as she would like me to be. She is a very traditional woman who believes in rigid gender roles for women. She’s attempted to push this belief on my daughter by making comments about what my daughter wears and does. 

She has made comments to my daughter like, “wear leggings with your dress, or else you make God upset. And when God’s upset, he sends people to bad places.” This has made my daughter feel very ashamed and paranoid. She has also expressed disdain for when my daughter said she wanted to become a veterinarian. My mother in law said, “A proper lady should not work outside the home. Focus on raising a family.” (She also hates me because I work, and was very against this.) 

She does not hold the same sentiment towards my son (8m). She shows clear favoritism towards my son while consistently criticizing everything my daughter does. 

While my husband typically defends me in front of his mom, he is adamant we move her into our house. His reasoning is that she is too sick to take care of herself, and his only other brother is ill fit to take care of her (he’s in rehab). 

I suggested, “Then put her in a retirement home,” which made him incredible angry. He says that at the end of the day this is his mother, and he has a duty towards her. He promised that if she moves in, he will talk to her about her attitude towards me and our daughter. However, I don’t want to raise my kids anywhere near her. She has been shaming my daughter, and I barely get along with her. 

Last night, out of anger, my husband said, “You can move out of the house, but I’m not moving my mother into a retirement home!”

My dad and her mom used to work together. We weren’t close growing up, but when she moved to my city around 5 months pregnant, she reached out. I know how lonely it can be to move somewhere new, so I agreed to hang out and tried to help her settle in. When I moved here, I didn’t know anyone either. And now I’m the only one she knows. 

At first it was fine, I did little things like I drove her to look at apartments (she didn’t have a car), helped her run errands, and my dad even built her furniture when she got an apartment. My dad came to visit me for the weekend and we spent it helping her settle in. She has no support system, the baby’s dad is out of the picture, and she’s unemployed (not sure how she’s funding everything). I genuinely wanted to be kind and supportive. I even introduced her to some of my friends and she was so rude to them and then wouldn’t stop talking poorly about them. 

But then things escalated. She started demanding I go with her everywhere.. doctor’s appointments, grocery shopping, even to do nails. She started jokingly calling the baby “our baby” because I’ve been around so much. She’ll say things like “our baby is craving fries from McDonalds” and beg me to get them for her. She even offers to pay me. She refuses to use meal delivery apps because she doesn’t trust that they won’t do something to the food, she says. 

This has been going on FOR MONTHS. 

Fast forward: I’m a bridesmaid in my best friend’s wedding and flying home (Puerto Rico) for 4 weeks to help with the shower, rehearsal, wedding, and even organizing her closet in her husband’s apartment while she’s on her honeymoon (they don’t live together until after the wedding). When my acquaintance came over and saw me packing, she lost it. She said I never told her about my trip. She said she was counting on me to be there for the birth (which will definitely happen while I’m away, I leave tomorrow and she’s ready to pop any minute), and even expected me to MOVE IN with her for the first month after the baby was born to “help out,” since I have nanny experience. She also told me she was planning on me watching the baby on the days I work from home (2 days of the week). 

I told her I wasn’t canceling my flight or shortening my trip, and now she’s furious, saying I’m abandoning her and the baby. That I’m all they have. She’s posting about me on social media saying I betrayed her. Her mom, who lives in our state just 4.5 hours away, is commenting and encouraging her. 

I told my mother about this and she also said I was a bad friend to leave her and her baby when they need me, that she agrees moving in is a lot but I should be there during birth, only travel for the wedding, and then come back to help with meals, etc. and told me she won’t be picking me up at the airport tomorrow because she knows I’ll do the right thing. 

So.. AITA? ",Desperate_Donkey2212,4786,0.949999988079071,957,1755815031,2025-08-21 17:23:51,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mwp6wp/aita_for_not_canceling_plans_to_be_there_for_the/,8,2025
1mxfetz,AITA for not letting my daughters boyfriend propose at my vow renewal?,"I (50M) have been married to my wife for almost 25 years, we plan on throwing a huge vow renewal in December,it's basically going to be like a 2nd wedding. The whole shebang. We have 7 kids together and this regards our baby girl LaLa.(20F)

Her boyfriend came to me a little over a month ago and asked me for her hand and also asked if he could propose at the vow renewal. Hes a great guy ans we get along super well and i genuinley like him for my daughter. I, said yes to both originally and was super excited. A few weeks pass ans he asks can he also invite a few family members of his, i was expecting maybe his parents and siblings, but he instead sends me a list of 25 family members he wants to add. I have a few problems with this. 

1. His family does NOT like my daughter. Thwy are Asian and do not like that their son is with a black woman. And considering nearly everyone else there will be black...
2. He expects us to fund these people.like regular guest. As I mentioned this would be just like a wedding. So 25 extra people is a LOT of money 

I told him i couldn't accommodate that many people, he got angry and said I wss ruining his special moment and that I ""don't really care about Lala"" and said I can't do anything if thwy just show up. I said they absolutely will not show up. I then told him he still had my hand/permission to marry my daughter, but he was not allowed to propose at the vow renewal.

Now him, his family, and my 2 sons both say i was being an asshole and should just suck it up. But my other kids and my wife say that im not an asshole and that hes crazy.

1mpfvtl,AITA for not paying for a wedding I’m not attending?,"I (30f) started a relationship with Joe (31m) in the middle of May of this year. Shortly after we started going out, he asked me to be a plus-one to his friend Meg’s wedding. i have never met Meg, but I agreed to go. We RSVPed, and Joe booked plane tickets and a hotel room.

A couple days ago, I ended the relationship with Joe. It’s important to note that while money was not the main reason for the breakup, it was one of the things we argued about most. I am very frugal (perhaps to a fault), and Joe likes to spend money on creature comforts and trips, and often expects me to do the same. Joe lives at home rent free, while I have my own apartment. I live pretty much paycheck to paycheck, with a small stash set aside in savings.

There’s still about five weeks left to the wedding. I ended the relationship when I did partly because I didn’t want to be in the pictures from the wedding and cause people to feel bad when they looked back at those pictures. I am returning everything Joe left in my apartment, save a few things he was okay with me keeping. I also offered to pay for my plane ticket and my half of the hotel stay as a good-faith gesture. It comes to over $400, which is just about everything I have in savings.

Today, Joe contacted me and asked if I could pay another $125 on top of all of that to offset Meg’s costs for my plate and everything at the reception. He says it’s so close to the wedding and since deposits have gone to vendors, I should pay my portion. I think that more than a month’s notice is ample time for Meg to either fill the seat or for Joe to find another plus-one, who would also be benefitting from my paying half of the hotel stay. I also think that since I wouldn’t pay that money if I was attending, then I shouldn’t have to pay now that I’m not. It’s my understanding that people not going to weddings after they RSVP is just one of those costs that’s inevitable, and I’m at least doing Meg the courtesy of giving over a month’s notice.

1n2pul2,AITA for telling my husband to wipe better after pooping?,"My husband (39m) & I (39f) are in a days-long fight about his toilet habits.

We’ve been married for 13 years. It has not been all rainbows & sunshine, so we’ve been going to couples counseling for a few months now.

The argument:

Sometimes when I go to the bathroom, I see that my husband pooped, but forgot to flush. I didn’t say anything at first bc he works hard & he’s a busy man. However, it started happening more frequently the past couple months (once/twice a week I’d find his poo in the toilet), so I finally brought it up. Just like “Hey, [this scenario] has been happening more lately. Not a big deal. Please try to remember to flush.” He was apologetic, & said he would make an effort. Cool.

Less than a week later, I went to the bathroom and got another brown peekaboo. No poop, but a bunch of toilet paper streaked with poop was sitting in the toilet. So I told my husband, “you forgot to flush again”. He replied “oh, yeah, I guess I did leave a bunch of toilet paper in the toilet. Sorry about that, it won’t happen again.” I replied, “No, it wasn’t just toilet paper. It was a bunch of *poopy* toilet paper.” I wanted to be clear about what the problem was, I didn’t want him to think I was just nagging about some lingering *plain clean* TP in the toilet. I feel like he has a history of downplaying or invalidating concerns that I voice to him, and I didn’t want that happening in this situation.

He got defensive after I clarified that. It seemed like he wanted to explain why there was poopy TP, but no poop. Personally, I didn’t really think much about that until *he* brought up that point. He shouted “DO I HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU?!?!” I was like, “ummmm, I guess so. I don’t think there’s a super obvious reason for a bunch of poopy TP hanging out on its lonesome. And I don’t like the condescending aggressive tone you’re speaking to me with.” He continued yelling about how sometimes he doesn’t get fully clean after pooping & initial wiping, so his butthole ends up feeling itchy later in the day, and so he’ll wipe it before getting in the shower. Hence, the poopy TP that he forgot to flush.

From there, it totally blew up into a screaming match. I told him that he should just properly wipe his butt immediately after pooping. At some point in the yelling, he accused me of trying to shame and embarrass him. I said “Well that’s not my intent, but yeah, a grown adult SHOULD be properly wiping after going to the bathroom!!!!! And I know I would certainly be embarrassed if I was you rn! wtf??”

We haven’t really been speaking for a few days. He said he’s sorry, but also thinks I should apologize, & he’s being aggressive about it.

It was never my intent to make him feel badly. But I’m unwilling to apologize when he’s being so aggressive and accusatory. Yesterday, he told me in anger that I need individual therapy for my behavior.

Considering our current work in couples counseling, I think we both could’ve been nicer during this exchange.

1n52g0q,AITA for refusing to give my sister her “dream wedding” dress even though I own it?,"When my grandmother passed away two years ago, she left me her wedding dress. It’s vintage and hand made. She left it to me specifically because I was the oldest granddaughter and was always close to her.

my younger sister is getting married. She asked if she could wear Grandma’s dress. At first, I was open to it. But when I said I’d want it back afterward (since it’s an heirloom and very sentimental to me), she blew up. She said she wants it because its her wedding, which includes cutting it to be shorter

I told her no. If she wants to borrow it that's fine, But if she wants to basically destroy it, then no. Now my entire family is calling me selfish and saying I’m ruining her “dream wedding” just because I want to hoard a dress I’ll “probably never wear.”

I don’t plan to wear it anytime soon, and it will mostly sit preserved in a box. But I also don’t want to lose something so important to me just because my sister wants it.

My parents are telling me that since it’s a wedding dress, it should be passed around and used for weddings, not hoarded. My fiancé says I’m right to keep it.

I'm a 40 year old veteran and like a lot of vets, I use military discounts when I can. Last week, I went out to dinner with my brother and his fiancée, and a couple of friends. When the check came, I told the server I had a military discount. My brother’s fiancée immediately jumped in and said ""Oh just put it all under his bill so we all get the discount"" 

I could tell the waitress felt uncomfortable because she was about to say no so I told her that’s not how it works and the discount only covers me, and if I’m paying my own tab, fine, but I’m not about to cover a table of six just so everyone can save a few bucks. She called me selfish and said “you didn’t even pay full price to serve, so why hoard the perks now?” That honestly stung. 

I calmly told her that if she wants a military discount, she can enlist. My brother said I was being an ass and making her feel unwelcome in the family. I pointed out that she was the one being disrespectful, but now my mom says I should’ve just “kept the peace” and paid for the table because it wasn’t worth the drama.

1mrd44z,WIBTA if I tell my friend I don't like being around her kid,"I (32m) have a female friend (29f) that has a kid.

I am at the point where I want to tell her to not bring her kid around me. This will be difficult because the kid has grown really fond of me. 


The child is four years old, but I don’t like how she’s allowed to behave. She is still breastfeeding at that age, and she isn’t properly potty trained. To clarify, she can sometimes use the bathroom on her own, but other times she just soils herself. She doesn’t have any mental challenges. On top of that, she has a cellphone that she’s glued to constantly. All of this annoys me, but since she’s not my child, I don’t comment. I mind my own business. 

The bigger problem is that this child cannot take no for an answer. When she’s with her mother, she bullies her by crying hysterically until her mom gives in to whatever she wants. You might wonder how this affects me.

Well, the child often cries hysterically for my laptop or smartwatch. I’m not rich, and I can’t afford for a kid to break my things. Once, her mom left her with me briefly while she went to grab something from the car. During that short time, the child reached for my prescription glasses. When I refused to give them to her, she threw such a hysterical tantrum. The cries were so loud and gut wrenching that people thought I had spanked her.

1mjfh6g,AITA for refusing the sell the crystal I got from my grandmother,"My grandmother collected stones and crystals for decades. About 50 years ago, her brother gifted her a 25 kg crystal (clear quartz geode) he found. (I don't know the exact story).

My grandmother's love for crystals and stones is the reason I started collecting them too. For the last couple of years before she passed away, she would gift me a couple of items from her collection every time I saw her.

She had the giant crystal displayed in her house, and she knew how much I loved it, often telling me if I still collected crystals when she passed away, I would get it. Unfortunately, she passed from cancer when I was 9. Since she had promised me the crystal, my dad got it for safekeeping. I didn't have the space for it in my bedroom, and I have been moving around finishing my degree since I moved out of my parents' house, so the crystal has been at my parents' house since she passed.

I bought my first home earlier this year and got the keys on August 1, so I am in the process of fully moving in. When I started moving into my home, I was offered the crystal, since my grandmother wanted me to have it, and I would finally have space for it, and won't be moving anytime soon.

When I got the crystal, I also got some paperwork from when my grandmother had it valued back in the 90s. It was valued at around 5000 euros (I have no clue if this estimate is even remotely correct today, and don't care since I don't plan on selling it). When my siblings found out the price of the crystal, they got mad that I got something so expensive and wanted me to sell it and split the value between us. I have refused to do so; my grandmother wanted me to have it because she didn't want someone to just sell it. My siblings feel this is unfair since they only got some sentimental items, but nothing worth real money. So AITA for refusing to sell the crystal I got from my grandmother?

1mt5yg2,AITA for ignoring my friend’s work messages while I’m on maternity leave?,"I’m currently on maternity leave from my job as a social media manager at a small start-up. When I went on leave, my friend actually took over my position (she only joined the company because of me).

Since then, she’s been messaging me constantly. Every other day it’s either questions about work, venting about colleagues, or sending me the content she posts so I’ll like or engage with it. She messages me through both the company account (which I’ve muted) and her personal one.

On top of that, she often asks to come over and “help”; cooking, cleaning, walking the dog, whatever I need. It’s really generous of her, but the problem is that whenever she’s over, the conversation turns into work. The last time she came, she stayed for FIVE hours, and 80% of what we talked about was her job. I even ended up helping her do work because she was stressed, and she straight up asked me to join a meeting with her.

I feel so stuck. I don’t want to hurt our friendship, and I know she’s just trying her best, but this is supposed to be my maternity leave. I’ve already had to tell other coworkers to respect my time, and she even backed me up on that… yet she doesn’t seem to realize she’s doing the same thing.

So lately I’ve just been ignoring the work-related messages (she doesn't seem to get the message). I’ll still reply if it’s something personal, but if it’s about work I don’t answer. Now I’m worried I’m being rude or unsupportive, since she’s obviously struggling and looking for reassurance.

1mzb4ru,AITA For Stealing Back Pokémon Cards My Fiancé's Nephews Took (And Possibly Taking Extras)?,"Hello all, I'm keeping this off my main as my family members know my acct and I don't want them asking me about it just yet. 

To set the background, I'm (29F), my fiancé is (31M), and I have three children (8F, 7F, 5M). Sometime last year my daughter Summer (the 8F) started collecting Pokémon cards that her bio-dad would gift her during visitation. I haven't kept up with the fandom as I aged but collected coins as a kid and loved the idea of helping my daughter grow her collection. I have also supplemented the collection from lucky Goodwill finds. It is about 5 binders worth of cards, with cards from between 1995 to 2018 generally and some are very rare. 

My SIL asked my fiancé if we could babysit her two sons Peter (8M) and Paul (7M) while out of town for the weekend as she has to pick up her husband's nephew for something. I was not keen on this for a few reasons, being:

1) Peter has to attend an alternative school for anger issues and outbursts, and though they have become less frequent I wouldn't know how to handle it if something happens.  
2) Peter has had issues in the past with stealing money from my fiancé and I when we would leave cash out in our room. His mom would get defensive about it but $10 was never something I'd die on a hill for, so I'd usually drop it.   
3) Peter has also tried stealing my daughter's Pokémon cards in the past or my DBZ cards. I took them back but it blemished my relationship with my SIL a tad. 

Despite all this I hoped the weekend could go smoothly as she needed the help, so me and fiancé agreed.

However, last night while I was at work Summer called me and asked if she could 'give her Pokémon cards to Peter'. I could hear Peter whispering in the background. I was very clear in saying NO because I couldn't advise if there would be a fair trade or if he would take the more valuable cards. Later I asked my daughter if she really wanted to give him the cards and she said no. 

This morning while tidying my daughter's room I saw all the Pokémon binders out. I had a bad feeling, opened them up, and discovered HALF THE COLLECTION missing. The binders were full but now there were empty pages and scattered cards missing. I was pissed. I went to Peter's backpack and found some of my DBZ cards, my other daughter's full rock collection, and a massive plastic bag with a bunch of Pokémon cards dumped in. I took everything back and sorted my daughter's cards from Peter's, though I was just going by the card's print dates as Peter only had cards from 2022 and beyond (so I thought). I put the sorted cards in a lunch box.  
  
I told my fiancé at the time this, but Peter and Paul have noticed their card stash is much lighter and started whining in saying that their aunt gifted them some older cards that are missing. I'm sick and tired of them thinking they can just steal whatever they want from our house. AITA for not giving them any cards back, even if some are actually theirs? I'm worried they'll complain to my SIL.

1mxfls7,AITA for not inviting my sister in law to an event I know she would have enjoyed because she’s too judgy?,"I’ve always wanted to like my SIL Macey but she’s judgy about weird shit, like oh it’s superficial to get a designer bag when you should just go to the thrift store and get a $2 bag. But spending $600 on collectibles is okay. (They’re BOTH fine). Sadly this makes her the perfect partner for my brother. You can imagine the kind of personality he has lol.

The best example was when my sister Bee and her wife and a bunch of their friends were going to the Eras tour a few years ago. They’re all queer women too so they love Taylor. Macey thought that because I didn’t go I would be “on her side” and shit talk them, call them vapid and stupid cult members. I said I didn’t go because I’m just.. not a fan. I said she was behaving like a mean girl and to stop. She took offense because SHE was the victim of bullying as a kid. I said well I guess you didn’t learn from it because look at who you’ve become. She wouldn’t talk to me for months. 

Well a few weeks ago I got a ton of free tickets to the renaissance festival. I invited Bee and some other friends. Macey has said in the past she loves Ren Fests. She loves to get dressed up in period accurate costumes. I asked Bee if we should invite Macey and Bee said no, Macey would inevitably make some snarky comments about costumes not being accurate or something and ruin the mood for everyone. I thought about it and in the end agreed. Bee posted pics, Macey saw and asked us why we didn’t invite her. In the end, I told her that it was because I never know what she’s going to judge next. She said that we were bullying her. Bee brought up the Eras tour thing and how nasty Macey was about it and Macey defended herself by saying she never said that stuff TO her and I was wrong for telling her in the first place. 

My brother thinks we should have invited Macey and that we’ve gone out of our way to not be supportive and make her part of the family. I’ve literally had her over for baking Xmas cookies, movies, brunch. She’s never returned the favor. I just did not want to have a day where the mood was soured because of someone being judgy. He did not care about Macey ragging on Bee, either.

However, my dad has filed for bankruptcy and my brother has only been working for 3 months at his new job so he might not get approved. That’s why they need me to co-sign for my name and ID. They told me I won’t be paying anything because I wont need to put my banking information. That my brother and dad will pay it and i just have to act as a cosigner. 

This is my first time doing something like this, especially taking in a big commitment such as a home that I won’t even be living in. So naturally I started researching about it. I learnt that if my brother fails to pay it off on time and what not, I am financially responsible for it. I asked my mom questions of what it would mean for me to co-sign. I’m pretty hesitant because of my dad’s past history of being in debt.

She did not take it well. She said why am i thinking negatively of things, if i really loved my Dad i wouldn’t even think in this way and just say yes. I told her it’s because i want to think of things realistically and don’t want to be in debt in case my brother can’t pay things off. 

She said that my distrust in my dad is unfair. And that this is the only help i’ll be giving towards my family and I can’t even do it. (mind you, im paying for my mom and siblings’ house insurance, my mom’s phone bill, and other miscellaneous things that they need money for). 

Now she said she doesn’t want me to do it at all because of how i reacted. AITA? ",OkChampionship4457,2966,0.949999988079071,1314,1754172272,2025-08-02 17:04:32,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mg2mmf/aita_for_not_cosigning_a_mortgage_agreement_for/,8,2025
1mxl5wu,AITA for fencing off my property,"We bought the house we’re currently in about 6 months ago and we recently has a surveyor come to our property to figure out exactly where our property line is so we can put up a fence. The old fence was kind of a hodgepodge of different types of fences that were falling apart. We wanted to have something more uniform and you know, not falling apart. While the surveyor was here, the old lady living next door (noseybody) came out to see what we were doing and we let her know we were planning on putting up a fence. 

Here’s where it goes left but I don’t understand what the issue is. She said that we weren’t allowed to put up a fence and when we asked why, she said her dog was used to having all of not only her backyard but our backyard too because the old owners were okay with it. I don’t have anything against the dog but I also want a fence around our house because we have small children and it makes me feel better to know that we have a fence because there is a small forresty area and a small creek behind our property. 

She started ranting and raving about how young people today are selfish and that I’m an animal hater because I don’t want her dog to have space to roam. I told her that it had nothing to do with her and everything to do with us. She’s now trying to rally other people in the neighborhood to try and pressure us into not putting up a fence because her dog is “grandfathered in”. Not sure into what but reddit AITA?

1mnsbjr,AITAH my roommate says I can't move out until after her wedding,"I (34f) have been living in hotels and with an ex partner for the last 4 months because my apartment tested positive for mold, which I'm highly reactive/allergic to. At the same time, my 5 year old dog suddenly became severely ill. Her x-rays showed alarming inflammation in her lungs and overnight she was struggling to breathe. I packed a suitcase and left immediately thinking the mold was affecting her also. My plan was to find another place to stay while our landlord remediated the house. 

Devastatingly, only 2.5 weeks later my dog passed away. Her passing was extremely traumatic for me, but I will omit those details. I was in a very, very dark place. Not only did I lose my bestfriend and was living out of a suitcase, I also found out some unfortunate news regarding my own health, all the while being unemployed and living on savings and some generous help from my ex partner.

The night my girl passed away, my ex insisted I move into the extra bedroom of his apartment so I wouldn't grieve alone. He assured me that I could stay for as long as I needed to get back on my feet as well my house to be safe again. We get along super well, and I'm so grateful for his help. 

The whole time I've been here, both of my roommates have been constantly asking when I was coming back. Mind you, I've been paying my $2,200 rent plus utilities this whole time. (I live in SF, lol.) My answer has always been the same: I'm not coming back until the house is remediated. Unfortunately something was delaying the process of it all. 

Last week, I finally decided that I no longer wanted to pay rent for a place that I wasn't living in, especially because I was still unemployed. I knew the timing of my notice was less than ideal because my roommate ""Kate"" (46f), who is the master tenant and responsible for finding a replacement tenant, is in the throws of planning her wedding, amongst other things like talking to a surrogacy agency and immigration for her fiance, and I feel awful. I knew that she wasn't going to take the news well, but her reaction was far more unexpected than I thought.

When I told her I was moving out (7 week notice) she said that the timing didn't work for her and that I was being unkind. She threatened to keep my deposit if I didn't push my move out date by another month. When I told her that was illegal she started to freak out and told me that our friendship would be over. I was in shock. She said ""you knew about the wedding for months!"", but I honestly didn't have the mental clarity to make that big of a decision until very recently. I told her as soon as I knew. 

I can't help but feel horrible and guilty, but all my friends are telling me 7 weeks is more than fair and she is the one being a bad friend. I just have no idea because they are obviously biased. I'm just so tired of being a people pleaser and I would essentially lose over $2k to make it convenient for her.

Obviously she is very upset about it and we have been supporting her as much as we can. She is in her 70s, lives 1.5 hours away and has never driven, so getting her to come to us has always been dependent on her and her husband travelling together. As husband and I are starting work again soon, we are wanting to encourage her to come to us more often by public transport, and her staying over would make things easier.

Our house is small. We have one bedroom and no sofa bed. We suggested to her that we could swap our sofa in the living room for a sofa bed so that she could spend more time here. She was hesitant, so we suggested that we have a really good double air mattress that she could stay on in the living room, but again she was hesitant. She is healthy and fit, so there are no medical reasons why she couldn't sleep on it. 

My husband has now asked me whether we could give up our bed and bedroom for her when she stays and we sleep on the air mattress. He said it'll only be once or twice.

1n53gml,AITA For reporting the girls that broke into my room?,"Hi, I'm pretty sure I'm not the ass hole in this situation but the girls made me feel really guilty.

On Friday, at around 10pm, two girls knocked on me and my sister's door. I thought that someone might need help or it was our RA so I told my sister to open the door. That's when these girls pushed their way into our room and started filming a room tour of our room for a Tiktok. 

For extra information: 
1. my room was hoarder level messy. Me and my sister have depression and it's really hard for us to keep a room clean + my sister has a chronic illness. We're trying to be better though but this night our room was really messy
2. Me and my sister are obese to put it bluntly. I really didn't want any bullying to come my sister's way. 
3. I was wearing night clothes and I didn't have a wig on and they filmed my wig that was on the table. 

So after they filmed the Tiktok, they left and I was in shock. I told them to not post it anywhere and they said they wouldn't and Left. My sister and I tried to laugh it off but I was really worried that we were going to be posted on the Internet so I got dressed and told a RA.

We found the girls and two RA's made sure that the video wasn't in their camera roll or tiktok drafts. The RAs asked why would they burst into our room without asking to film and they said that they ""Did it to everyone and nobody else had a problem with it"". The RAs said that they could be fined which made me feel really bad because I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't posted anywhere and I'm pretty sure they're athletes and I don't want their chances to be ruined. 

I called a couple of family members because I was traumatized and they agreed that it was wrong but they said if our room was clean, it wouldn't be an issue. It still would've been a problem though because I don't want to be on the Internet looking like that.

He told me I should have left at my scheduled time no matter what. He had plans with people and had to miss them because I was late and he was home with the kids. He said it’s also not the first time, which is true, it’s happened a few times over the last couple years, but never this long.

1n10ium,AITA for not wanting the puppy my bf bought for my birthday present?,"For context: I (27F) have always had pets dogs, cats, even birds that fell from their nests I also rescued and re-home tons of animals But I’ve never kept a male pet. My mom didn’t like them because of the whole “peeing everywhere” thing, and I guess I just got used to only having girl pets. Plus, I love using my dogs like pillows, and I’ll admit the doggy boy parts that are always a little too present makes me uncomfortable.

Anyway, I’ve had my dog let's call her luna since I was 17. She’s my baby and she 100% rules my life. She’s not really friendly with kids, other dogs, or most men, but she at least kinda likes my boyfriend (31M) of two years.
So, my birthday was a couple weeks ago. My boyfriend told me he had a “surprise” but it wasn’t ready yet. Last Friday, I came home from work and found him in my apartment with a two month old-ish German Shepherd male puppy that he Bought, complete with a balloon tied to its collar that said “Happy Birthday.” He smiled and said, “Do you like him? He’s our new son.”

I was shock the only words that came out were: Where’s luna?
He had locked MY dog in the bathroom because she growled at the puppy. I was furious.
We argued for about two hours. I told him to take the puppy back with him and not to come back he yell some more and called me a “misandrist” before leaving because apparently not wanting male pets = hating men. He also said I was “weird” for being uncomfortable around dog peepees. 

When I told my friends and family, everyone sided with me however my boyfriend keeps sending me videos of the puppy, saying he doesn’t know what to do with it since his apartment doesn’t allow pets especially one that would grow so much and begging me to take it “just until he finds accommodations.” He says I owe him because he spent so much money on the puppy and was planning the puppy to live with me anyway.

But I don’t want the puppy, my current dog definitely wouldn’t accept him, and in the videos I can already see how destructive he's becoming in the other hand the poor puppy is innocent in all this should I just suck it up and keep him with me until my boyfriend (we technically didn't broke up yet) finds somewhere else to take him?
 Also the puppy represent everything I don't want in a pet, I feel like he just bought himself a dog but don't really want to take care of it so he acted like the puppy was my birthday present.

I texted him that I had to sit down and he later came to find me and saw me sitting on the floor drinking my water. He told me in a whisper yell to get off the floor because it was gross and embarrassing but I told him I will as soon as I can, I really need to sit because I felt very unwell. 

I sat on the floor for a total of 10 minutes. After that I was well enough to go find a bench to sit on while I waited for him to finish shopping and then we went home.

1msal50,AITA for refusing to clean out my grandpa’s house 25 yrs post death.,"AITA for refusing to clean out my dead grandpa’s house? Here’s the story. My grandpa died when I was 15 years old, I am now 40 years old. My grandpa left his house to my aunt. His house is more of a permanent trailer, in a retirement community. My aunt has never been married, never had a serious boyfriend and has no kids. She is very sentimental. She has always made excuses as to why she won’t clean out or sell his house. Her excuses have been: too busy at work, too busy hanging out with friends and she hasn’t figured out what she wants to do with it. In the last 25 years, she has let the house rot. She’s never slept in it, doesn’t keep it up, but does pay the taxes and HOA. About 15 years ago, I offered over and over again to help her clean it out or fix it up. I didn’t want money for it, just wanted to help her so that she could use the place. I am independently successful, so I don’t want the money from the house. My aunt always refused to have me help her with the house. My husband even offered too, she said no. Since the house has been abandoned for so long, she mentioned to me about 5 years ago that animals have gotten into the house and there’s animal poop throughout the home. She has done nothing to clean it up and now there’s years and years of animal feces and maybe even dead animals inside. Fast forward to 2025, my mom passed away and I spent a grueling 3 weeks cleaning out my mom’s house. It was rough! I have 3 kids and had to leave my family to clean out my mom’s house.

I told my aunt that I can clean out her house when she passes, but asked her to please take care of my grandpa’s house herself. He’s been dead for 25 years and I feel like it’s unfair to have me clean that out too. Especially to have to clean out both her home and my grandpa’s house while juggling my own family of 5. My aunt told me, “Oh don’t worry about that. It will be so easy for you and you probably will only have to move out a mattress or two.” This is false, as his house is full of his possessions. It also upset me that she seems to have always expected me to do the work. I did love my grandpa. But his house literally is a hazmat situation with the animal feces, broken pipes, nonfunctional AC and more. She hung up on me when I told her the house would require hazmat suits to clean it out.

A week later, I texted my aunt and told her that it is her responsibility to take care of her father’s house and not mine. That was 5 months ago and she has not replied to me. She normally texts me every week. I’ve been ghosted. My concern is near Thanksgiving and Christmas she is going to show up to my house and pretend everything is fine. What do I do? This aunt has been very controlling and manipulative my entire life. This is the only time I’ve ever stood up to her. Part of me just wants her out of my life forever.

Hi, and thanks a lot for all the comments and verdicts in my first post, far more than I had anticipated, enough that my husband came across it too. First, I do want to clarify that my husband never said I was an AH, he said he agreed with the facts, that our daughter's name had had nothing to do with MIL, just the timing of it. But like a lot of the comments had said, perhaps setting the record clear in the moment had been the right thing to do.

My MIL had been bringing up the encounter to him in passing repeatedly since then, and she was also emphasizing the way and place and time that I corrected her, she was not claiming to have recommended the name any longer.

Yesterday, because my husband was having to deal with the bitterness of the situation, I had a call with my MIL. She said she was in shock at the way I had gone about it, that its not what she'd expected of me, how fond she was of my daughter, and that decisions like these are family decisions in spirit, doesn't matter the origin of the thought. I said I understand and deeply regretted the unpleasantness but it was a name close to my heart since I was young and had read the books so that's why this was different to me than any other decision, like the choice of stroller for instance. My MIL brought up that I had sent her a link of how it was a very popular name back when I had told her about it the first time. I said that yes but I'd done that after the fact, just to show it wasn't a completely out there name, and that I didn't even know what the result of the popularity of the name would be when I'd searched for it, but this name was from my heart. She said she understands and again reiterated how much she loves our daughter and I thanked her and told her how much I appreciated it. 

I think I've handled the situation well. My husband too seems content after my call.

Basically, it's me controlling the character, but my brother makes all the decisions for things like skill points, customization, any in game decisions, which direction to go, what quest/mission to do, and stuff like that. He tried doing it with our parents too, but our mom doesn't like violence at all, so she won't, and our dad isn't very good with tech stuff and every single time he needs every little thing reexplained even a lot of the times during the same game session. Then he just keeps on dying, so it doesn't really work.

He enjoys it and keeps asking me to play for him more, but I said no because it's a very unenjoyable activity for me. There's nothing fun about basically just being a verbal input machine for him. Plus, if it's a game I've played before it's so boring and if it's a game I haven't played before it ruins the experience for me.

Also, it takes up a lot of time and makes me not like playing video games so much. I do like playing video games by myself, but I also don't always want to be in front of a screen. So, if I play games for him it takes up my mental capacity for screen time and I don't get to play games for myself.

Still, he wants me to play for him because it's his only way he sort of gets to play and feel like he is involved in the game. I kept refusing though so he started bothering me whenever I was playing video games. He will come in the room and sort of back seat game by telling me what I should do or should have done which is very annoying and also ruins it for me because it's distracting. Even if he is quiet for like a minute its annoying having someone silently judge everything you do and makes me second guess everything I'm doing. Kind of like in school and a teacher just stops and stands over you and looks at what you're writing.

So now I've started only playing games on my steam deck or switch because then I can play in my bed or right against a wall so my brother can't look over my shoulder or I can at least move away if he tries to. He gets mad at me when I do this because he said he just wants to watch me play and it's not fair that I won't let him when he can't even play anymore. I told him he should just watch streamers play then, but he says it's not the same because he doesn't get to feel involved because they never read his comments.",FunMammoth6910,1916,0.9300000071525574,325,1754868442,2025-08-10 18:27:22,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mmxfgn/aita_for_not_playing_video_games_for_my_brother/,8,2025
1mt0mqm,AITA for telling my roommate’s boyfriend he has to pay £100 toward utilities or move out after his “one-week” stay hit five weeks?,"I (F27) share a 2-bed flat with a roommate (F26). Her boyfriend “stayed for a week” after his lease ended. We’re on week five. In that time he’s been showering twice a day, cooking with my pots/spices, pouring my milk/using my eggs, and my shampoo keeps magically shrinking. Our smart meter’s been climbing and the water bill’s up; the living room has basically turned into his office/gaming den.

Last week I asked for a totally reasonable contribution: £100 toward utilities and to stop treating my food/toiletries as communal. He laughed and said it’s “temporary” and I’m being “transactional.” Roommate says I’m “making her choose,” that he’s “basically family,” and I should show “compassion.” I actually like him fine, but compassion doesn’t pay the bill when the meter’s spinning.

So I set a boundary: **by Friday**, either (1) he transfers £100 and agrees to stop using my groceries/personal items, or (2) he finds somewhere else to sleep. Now I’m the villain for “setting ultimatums.” For context, when we moved in we agreed that guests are a few nights, not a third roommate by stealth. This isn’t a guest anymore - it’s an unpaid tenant with opinions.

I’m not trying to ban him; I just don’t want to subsidize soeone who isn’t on the lease. If he chipped in and respected basic house rules, great. But right now it feels like I’m sponsoring a staycation.

AITA for enforcing a **pay-or-go** deadline?

**TL;DR:** Roomie’s BF came for “a week”; it’s week 5. Bills up, he uses my stuff, pays nothing. I said contribute £100 and stop treating my things as communal or he leaves. Now I’m “controlling.” AITA?",Ellafaith0x,1893,0.9700000286102295,200,1755460046,2025-08-17 14:47:26,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mt0mqm/aita_for_telling_my_roommates_boyfriend_he_has_to/,8,2025
1n3k5l2,AITA for canceling a visit with my mom after she put being a landlord first?,"Situation is a bit complex emotionally, but maybe not legally. 1-2 years ago I have moved to a new city and began renting an apartment from my mom and her husband. They own a couple of units in a semi-popular city. They charged me market rent or slightly above market rent (it was not cheap), we signed a lease, whatever. After a year, it went to month to month. They were typical landlords to us in the sense that they ignored us half of the time, but we always paid rent on time, were good neighbors to the other tenants, etc. Additionally, I had helped them with their business multiple times for free, offering services that would probably have totaled up to 1k-1.5k. Plus helping them out with like house sitting, pet sitting, airport rides, etc. Things normal family members should do for one another.

I got a job offer in another state, so we formally ended the lease and began to move out. A major complication during this is that my dog (originally my mom's, but the dog picked me as 'her' person), went into congestive heart failure. This took an overwhelming toll on my mental health and financials. The dog is stable-ish now. My mom knows about this and how distraught I've been and when moving, I told her I'm going to need my entire(or as much as I can get) deposit back to help with the bills from the dog and move. She agreed so long as the apartment was clean, which is fair. My partner and I with the help of a friend deep cleaned the apartment, aside from the walls which she told me not to worry about since she's going to repaint them regardless. She saw the apartment and agreed it was good to go and we're all settled. 

The issue came when they sent our deposit back and she went back on her word. They took $500 for ""cleaning and painting fees"" even when they assured us they were not going to do that. When I asked her why, she accused me of not deep cleaning the house. I requested photos of what was needed to be clean(which she refused to provide) and why she still charged us for painting when she said not to worry about it. At first, she said those conversations never happened and when I sent proof of those conversations her argument shifted to ""You're lucky we didn't change you more, you should be grateful it was only $500."" She knows we needed that money for an upcoming surgery for my dog (left atrial decompression) and I was in total shock.

She was supposed to come visit us in our new apartment in mid-September, but I ended up canceling the visit. She's always been kind of selfish and never there for me, but even this surprised me. She knows the depths of how hard we're struggling and still took the money when they're plenty wealthy. $500 is a lot of money, but it feels more than just the money for me. She went back on her word and put being a greedy landlord first over being my mom. AITA for canceling the visit over this?",zaddydarby,1803,0.9700000286102295,108,1756503801,2025-08-29 16:43:21,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1n3k5l2/aita_for_canceling_a_visit_with_my_mom_after_she/,8,2025
1mygyxb,AITA Family Vacation,"My family of 5 has been planning a Disney vacation with my sister and her family of 5 and our parents. Initially when my sister presented the idea she said we could be at Disney for our children’s birthdays (they are a week apart my daughters is first) and celebrate each birthday. Suggested length of stay was around 10 days. 
My sister purchased her Disney tickets and bought a 4 day pass. She did not discuss this with any of us. Then announced the travel day would be on my daughter’s birthday due to work and school schedules. My wife and I said we understand their choice but would not be willing to travel on our daughter’s birthday. We were asked to reconsider but have stood our ground. After review costs of flights and accommodations it ended up being cheaper for us to arrive 2 days early and leave 1 say after everyone. My sister is livid and says we are ruining her kids vacation and purposely excluding her and her family. Even though once they arrive we are going along with her itinerary and no group plans were changed on our end. Am I wrong for going before everyone?",Substantial-Emu-9437,1798,0.9800000190734863,127,1755993317,2025-08-23 18:55:17,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mygyxb/aita_family_vacation/,8,2025
1mf7grf,AITA for telling my sister to stop feeding her baby junk food?,"Feeling increasingly guilty about this, help me feel better or worse! 

My sister has a baby boy who turned one in June. I’ve recently been helping her out by looking after him why she and her partner move house. I’ve been increasingly shocked by what she sends him to my house with for lunch. 
This is now: a sausage roll (either Greggs or a Tesco mystery meat from a multipack), 2 bags of crisps (I am not talking about lentil crisps/veg stick brands for babies, I am talking about actual crisps), chocolate biscuits, cake bars and most recently Jaffa cakes. There’s always a yoghurt thank heavens, but that’s it in the way of any form of nutrients. 

At first I tried the jokey approach, telling her my three-year-old would start to get jealous of all these treats, that I was worried I couldn’t cope with my nephews sugar highs etc. After several weeks I’ve snapped and told her she is going to have a poorly child who looses all his teeth by age 5 if all she feeds him is junk, and she became upset and said she can’t help it if her child is a fussy eater. She is now mortified, said I’ve accused her of being a crap parent and now things aren’t the same between us. 

Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut, but he’s a BABY, and really should be getting a healthier diet. No idea what to do from here.
