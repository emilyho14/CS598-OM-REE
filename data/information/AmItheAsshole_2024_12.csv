1h59slu,AITA for yelling at my sister for putting her phone on DND and leaving her 1st grader at school without picking him up?,"Today at 4 PM, my nephew’s elementary school called me. He’s 7 years old and in 1st grade. He had been left at school for about 40 minutes after dismissal, and the office said they couldn’t reach anyone on his emergency contact list. They asked if I could get in touch with his parents—my sister and her husband.

I tried calling both of them, but their phones were on ""Do Not Disturb."" The calls would ring once and go straight to voicemail, which was odd because their phones should usually ring a few times before going to voicemail. Since neither of them was reachable, I got concerned and decided to go pick up my nephew myself.

While I was on my way, I kept trying to call my sister. She finally called me back about 90 minutes later, saying she and her husband had just been napping. I was furious. It felt incredibly irresponsible for them to leave their child stranded at school and silence their phones, especially as parents of a young child and a toddler.

Her excuse was that her husband had asked his grandparents to pick up my nephew, but there was a ""miscommunication."" I told her that even if that was the plan, she shouldn’t have put her phone on ""Do Not Disturb,"" because emergencies like this can happen. Her response shocked me—she said she likes putting her phone on ""Do Not Disturb"" during naps and, if I was going to react this way, she would remove me from my nephew’s emergency contact list. She also added that I was the last contact on the list anyway because her in-laws (the grandparents) were listed first.

She then accused me of overreacting, saying that ""normal people"" wouldn’t get angry about something like this. She even mentioned that she’s made a lot of new friends this year and now understands how ""normal"" people act. I found this insulting because I was the only one responsible enough to answer the school’s call and make sure her child was safe.

She continued justifying herself, saying it’s normal for people not to answer their phones if they’re busy, at work, or in meetings. She insisted that having her phone on ""Do Not Disturb"" was necessary because she naps with her toddler and needs complete silence. By the end of the conversation, she tried to make me feel like I was in the wrong for being upset. She said I had a right to be concerned but no right to be angry or yell at her.

She then added that she doesn’t like spending time with family because “there’s always an argument” when she talks to us. This left me completely baffled. Instead of showing any gratitude for my help, she threw backhanded insults at me, even though I was the one who ensured her child’s safety. Her reaction made me question whether I was wrong to be upset, but I still feel her behavior was irresponsible and ungrateful.",flippingnoob,14245,0.9700000286102295,2281,1733183813,2024-12-02 17:56:53,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h59slu/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sister_for_putting_her/,12,2024
1hf3hjd,AITA for accepting cake at my friend's birthday party?,"So this is a bit of a weird one. I (41M) was at a friend's birthday party on the weekend just past. There were 9 of us at the party including the birthday boy (which is surprisingly relevant). All fake names from here on out.

Amy (30ish F), one of the guests, baked a cake for the birthday boy. After the relevant party traditions of singing the birthday song, and the hip-hip-hooraying that happens after the birthday song here in Australia, I went back to talking to one of my friends when Amy came up to me and the other friend with 2 plates of cake and offered them to my friend and I. We both said yes, thanked her, and then she made a really odd face and walked away. My friend and I both said it was weird, and went back to chatting. I ate some of the cake and it had desiccated coconut inside it, which I don't particularly like, so after a couple of bites, I ignored it and then chucked it out when the party ended about an hour or so later.

About 45 minutes ago, Steven (30ish M), Amy's partner, sent me a series of angry texts (8am on a Monday morning is really not the best time to receive angry texts) saying how Amy spent last night crying about how she didn't get to eat any of her cake and that I took a slice of it only to throw it away and deprive her of her own cake, and that she only cut 8 slices since she knows I don't like coconut, but I took her slice and threw it away to spite her. I replied, ""Why did she even offer me any cake if she knew there was coconut inside?"" Steven said that she did it to be polite and not leave me out, and that I was an asshole for taking her slice and throwing it away.

I forwarded the message to my other friends that were there, and most of them have left me on read so far, except one who responded with a thumbs down emoji, and another who hasn't seen it yet (as of this writing). The fact that no one's responding to me is making me worry that I might have been the asshole here.",LeoHyuuga,10941,0.9800000190734863,2186,1734299790,2024-12-15 15:56:30,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hf3hjd/aita_for_accepting_cake_at_my_friends_birthday/,12,2024
1hbg0jb,AITA for refusing to share my “special” recipe with my cousin who wants to use it for her business?,"
So here’s the deal. I (18F) have this amazing dessert recipe that I came up with after months of experimenting in the kitchen. It's a unique twist on a classic treat, and everyone who tries it says it’s incredible. My family always asks me to make it for gatherings, and honestly, I take a lot of pride in how much people love it.

Recently, my cousin ""Jess"" (24F) started a small baking business from home. She’s been doing pretty well, and I’m happy for her! Last week, at a family dinner, Jess pulled me aside and asked if I’d give her my dessert recipe so she could add it to her menu.

I was flattered at first, but then I told her I wasn’t comfortable sharing it because it’s really personal to me—it’s my “thing,” you know? Jess didn’t take that well. She said I was being selfish and that it’s not like I’m starting a business or anything, so why would I hoard the recipe?

She even got my aunt (her mom) involved, who called me later and said I should “support family” and not be so “stingy.” I explained that I wasn’t trying to be mean, but I worked really hard to create that recipe, and it’s something I’m proud of.

Now half my family is calling me petty, and the other half is staying out of it. Jess posted a vague rant on Facebook about people “gatekeeping creativity” and how it’s “impossible to get ahead with unsupportive people.” My mom says I should just give her the recipe to keep the peace, but I don’t think I’m in the wrong here.

So, AITA?",Designere-juice,10285,0.9599999785423279,2302,1733874659,2024-12-10 17:50:59,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hbg0jb/aita_for_refusing_to_share_my_special_recipe_with/,12,2024
1hf5o9t,AITA for telling a child no?,"Recently at a school event, the teacher asked if the parent group I'm a part of could provide cookies and cocoa.  I thought it might be nice to also provide things to add to the cocoa,  in this case marshmallows, whipped cream, and sprinkles. 

I had a child tell me that she doesn't drink cocoa and asked for just a cup of whipped cream. (Note she and her friends were the first in line. ) As she ate the chocolate chip cookies, I'm fairly certain it wasn't an allergy to chocolate, just a preference to not drink cocoa.  As soon as she asked, the five other kids wanted to have just a cup of the whipped cream too. So I could see where this would end up.  So I told her no,  that I was sorry,  I only had a limited supply of the whipped cream and if I told her yes I'd have to let everyone do it too and the people behind her in line wouldn't have the cream to add to their cocoa.  I offered her a cup to grab some water, but she stomped away mad.  Five minutes later, her mom came up and asked for a cup of whipped cream, and there was another immediate chorus of people wanting cups of whipped cream too. So I explained again about the whipping cream and the people in line, and mom stomped away mad.  A teacher who was attending the event with her child and not connected to the class or parent group (only add a child in the class) came up and asked,  with the predictable round of ""me too"". I again explained as there is still a line out the door and down the hall,  and only having a certain amount of whipped cream available, if I say yes to this child, I'll have to let everyone get cups of cream too, so I was sorry,  but the answer is no.  When this unconnected teacher caught me with my back turned, she took the whipped cream anyway and gave it to the child.  Which started an avalanche of folks wanting the same thing.  So I kept having to say no,  sorry,  no for the next 45 minutes until everyone had made it through the line.  I will say that we didn't end up running out,  but the last person to use it got the very last bit outof the last can. 

So AITA for saying no,  and for being mad at that person doing it anyway? ",Express-District-317,9364,0.9700000286102295,804,1734306019,2024-12-15 17:40:19,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hf5o9t/aita_for_telling_a_child_no/,12,2024
1hi5pmy,AITA For Not Letting A Woman Cut The Line At The Grocery Store? ,"Hi Reddit. I need your opinion on grocery store etiquette and not letting someone cut the line. Tonight after work I stopped by my local grocery store to grab a handful of items to make dinner. 5 items in total. I maneuvered my cart behind an older woman who was slowly navigating putting her groceries on the belt to be checked out. She was the only person I noticed in front of me.

A few minutes later another woman tries to edge her way in line in front of my cart. I gave her a quizzical look and she said ""Oh, I was here before, but I went to go and see if the other line over there was moving faster.""

I said, ""Okay, but you weren't here when I arrived soooo (shrug).""

The woman proceeded to inform me, she was here first and that she should be let back in because she only stepped away to see if the other line was faster. I replied that I did not see her here before I joined the line, so, she could get behind me or go back to the other line.

At this point she showed me that she only had a few things and was shocked that I wasn't going to let her back in (she had 4 packs of jello). I pointed out that I too only had a few things and I wasn't going to move because I did not see her in the line in front of me when I joined.

Now this is where I may be the Asshole. At this point we're both getting frustrated in this grocery store pissing match for pole position. She says ""So you're not going to let me back in? Where's your Christmas spirit?"". I'd had enough of her entitlement at this point and I shot back ""Don't pull that shit.""

Honestly, if I had been behind her in line, I would have happily held her place if she has asked. But she wasn't there when I arrived and she just assumed she could cut back in line after a few minutes. Using Christmas Spirit as a means to get what she wanted was the last straw for me.

In the end she, glared at me and said ""I hope you have a Merry Christmas"" her voice dripping with sarcasm. And she left to go back over to another cashier.

The irony is, we both left the store with our items at the same time.

So Reddit, am I the Asshole for not letting this woman cut in front of me and calling her out when she tried to use ""Christmas Spirit"" to get her way",Fit_Track3827,8888,0.9700000286102295,1319,1734649406,2024-12-19 17:03:26,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hi5pmy/aita_for_not_letting_a_woman_cut_the_line_at_the/,12,2024
1h4el0n,AITA for not moving out of the way while getting off the plane for a tantrum throwing child (not mine)?,"Everyone knows the joy of deplaning after a long Thanksgiving weekend.  This flight was four hours long and understandably when we reached the gate everyone was ready to deplane.  I was in an aisle seat so I stood up to get my bag from above, as did the gentleman across from me and those in front of me.  A mother with two kids (maybe 3 & 4?) behind me let both of them crawl over their seats and join both her and her husband in the aisle as well, which made things very crowded. The youngest crammed himself between me and his sister and started throwing an absolute tantrum- pushing his sister, yelling at his dad who was trying to pick him up (saying “let me go! I hate you dad!” To which his mom replied in a sing song voice “we don’t talk to daddy that way [insert kid’s name].” 

The people in the aisles behind this mess moved back to their seats to make room for the little girl he was pushing back and the mom - in a much sterner voice than what she used with her tantrum throwing child, asked me “can you please move your body out of his way?” At first I assumed she was talking to her husband because he was crammed in the aisle too.  But when she said it again and tapped on my shoulder I realized she was talking to me.  

I couldn’t move forward because there were people in the row ahead of me grabbing their bags, and I still needed to get my bag down as well. 

Meanwhile the kid is still screaming.  So I simply said- “I’m sorry- I need to get my bag” to which she responded - “well your butt is in his face!”

At that point I wasn’t going to sit back down in my seat to accommodate her family of four crowding into the aisle. So I stayed, grabbed my bag, and deplaned.

1hltmaz,AITA for getting engaged after my brother’s wedding?,"EDIT: paraphrased some direct quotes and removed some potentially identifiable info. 

My brother and his now wife got married three days ago. A very small destination ceremony under 15 people total. My now fiancé and I extended our trip after everyone went home and spent a couple of days exploring the Grand Canyon, a couple hours north of the wedding, where he proposed. 

When I shared the news with my brother and now SIL, he responded with hostility saying that it looked like we were competing.

I apologized, quickly realizing that he was advocating for my SIL and that she felt hurt (although I’m truly failing to understand why). I also texted her a separate apology and explained that it was not our intent to encroach and just wanted to share the news with family and that it’s my belief that there’s room for happiness for everyone. She did not respond. 

In response to my apology, my brother doubled down and said the timing and location were hurtful and that we shouldn’t planned around the wedding.",andthatsfine,7407,0.9599999785423279,16,1735100679,2024-12-24 22:24:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hltmaz/aita_for_getting_engaged_after_my_brothers_wedding/,12,2024
1hdm9b8,AITA for keeping food from my wife?,"My wife loves fruit. She eats a lot of it and I, as the person who buys most of the groceries, try to keep the place constantly stocked. Apples, peaches, figs, plums, whatever is in season, it's on our counter. Right now it's persimmon season. We both like very different types. She likes fuyu and she likes them firm. I like any kind, but mostly hachiya and like them the texture of pudding. So I leave mine to ripen which can take days to weeks sometimes. Neither of us likes the other's style much. 

This week we got a bunch of each at the farmer's market. I left mine be in a basket in the corner of the kitchen. She ate all of hers by mid week and I got her more at the market and she ate those too. I just stared eating mine today and offered her a bite. She said, no, I'll get my own. And I said, no way, those are mine. I've been saving them and you know how much effort it takes to get them the way I like it, and you don't even like them that way.

She got upset at this and said this has been my thing our whole marriage. I designate food as mine. All food should be anyone's to eat if that person wants it at that moment, she says. I, personally, disagree with this. And I live my life leaving her what is hers, whether it's half of the leftovers or half a piece of cake or whatever. I don't just eat things. I consider her.

1h4g4rp,AITA for drama over pink wedding dress,"Throwaway account

Me (26f) and my fiance (26m) are getting married this coming May. Last week, me and my parents were discussing plans for the wedding. For the longest time (since teens perhaps), I have had my heart set on a pink wedding gown. That color makes me feel the prettiest and (I believe) suits me more than white. My mom has known about this interest, but always thought it was one of those fancies which would ""go away"" once I grew up and actually decided to get married.

Well, here we are. When I brought up the pink wedding dress again during our discussion, my mom and I got into a serious argument about it. She said that it would be childish and embarrassing of me to get married in a gown that color and she doesn't want me to regret in the future looking back at my photos. I argued that there was nothing embarrasing about wearing a color I like on MY special day, and even James didn't mind what color of the dress I wore. I also said that regret could go either way and I could end up regretting NOT wearing pink in the future so I'd rather go with the decision that makes me happy right now. Although my dad hasn't been as vocally against the pink dress, he is starting to side with mom seeing how upset she is getting over this.

Over the whole week, there has been no end in sight to this argument, with my mom bringing up multiple times how they won't pay their half for the wedding dress if I go with pink (the initial agreement was to split the bill 50-50). My brother (30m) thinks the whole argument over this color is ridiculous and told mom that he'd be happy to split the bill with me instead, and *they* might end up being the ones regretting this whole drama more than me regretting the color in the future.

I honestly feel so torn over this. I am not sure anymore if I want the pink dress that badly just because I feel hurt the way my parents reacted to it and made such a big deal out of it. On the other hand, this is what I have always wanted but I do feel like this small of a decision is causing a hige drama for no reason.

1hi3tz1,"AITA for ""Booping"" my MIL's nose when she kept touching my baby bump","Hubs and I are 31 weeks pregnant with our first.  We announced our pregnancy at 13 weeks and everyone was SUPER excited since they will be the first grandchild on either side.  I started showing at about 4.5 months and initially tried to be patient with my mom/MIL/Grand Parents/Aunts/Random old-lady-at-the-store when they wanted to touch my belly.  I wasn't crazy about people constantly rubbing my belly like I was some Buddha statue but let it go since everyone was excited.  After a few weeks I got touched out and politely asked people to stop or would nicely say no when they asked, which most people respected.

MIL tends to be overbearing and pushy.  Very much has main character syndrome.  Gets pouty and grumpy when she doesn't get her way. She was the only one that continued to constantly touch my belly even when I tried to say no. She'd always say she's just so excited she can't help herself. The bigger I got, the more it happened.

A couple weeks ago we were visiting DH's relatives for an event and and as soon as we walked in MIL made a beeline over to us.  That day I was just feeling icky - big, tired, uncomfortable, you know what I mean.  I put one hand up to stop her and tried to cover my belly with the my other hand.  She brushed my hand aside and and started rubbing my belly.

So that's when I got super annoyed and gently ""booped"" her on the nose.  I even said ""Boop"".  She just looked really confused and we ended up walking away to go talk to other relatives.  As we were leaving that night, she put her hands on my belly again and as soon as she did, I booped her again.  

We saw her again some days later with one of her friends.  Her friend asked if she could touch my belly and I nicely told her my stomach was all touched out and she was fine.  No drama.  While that was happening, MIL snuck up on my and started rubbing my belly again.  And I booped her on the nose again.

She looked really annoyed and said how irritating that was and asked why I kept doing it.  And I told her that if she was going to keep rubbing my belly after asked her not to, I was going to boop her on the nose. She got mad and said I was being childish and dramatic.  That night she called my husband crying and said I was being mean and embarrassed her in front of her friend.  DH got annoyed with me and said she was just showing how excited she was and that she's from an older generation so it wasn't nice of me to do that to her.  Instead he said I should have talked to her (again) and explained why I didn't want people rubbing my belly anymore.

So the reason I'm wondering if IATA is because I know she is super excited, by nature she is a very touchy-feely person, and I think she was legit embarrassed that I did that in front of her friend.",ThrowRAyetAnotherOne,4442,0.9700000286102295,1017,1734644274,2024-12-19 15:37:54,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hi3tz1/aita_for_booping_my_mils_nose_when_she_kept/,12,2024
1hhex71,AITA for not attending Christmas dinner with my family because it’s at 1 o’clock in the afternoon? ,"For context, I buy the Turkey at £130, dry brine it for 2 days, cook it, take it to my mums house and then cook all of the trimmings while I’m there. This involves many hours of work from me as you can imagine and I have to wake up at 7AM to get all of the timings right. 

The problem with this is that my partner and I barely get any time together on Christmas Day, we’d like to wake up, have a coffee, spend time together, open presents, maybe have a light breakfast and then get to cooking dinner at midday. 

We don’t usually eat breakfast or lunch as we intermittent fast and we’re never hungry for a giant plate of roasted food at 1 o’clock in the afternoon, effectively ruining the Christmas meal for us anyway. 

When children were involved and everyone had to get home early I compromised, even though I still didn’t really understand the whole eating at midday thing, but this year now the youngest child in attendance is 12 I tried to meet them in the middle and say could we maybe have it at 3? 

I’ve been told that I’m selfish and that I don’t compromise and that this is ridiculous. Thus I’ve decided that my partner and I will go round to see the family in the afternoon but not eat dinner with them. We’ll have our own meal at home in the evening, saving me money and allowing us to have the Christmas morning we’ve not had since we first lived together in 2018. 

Additionally, I’ll be able to experiment with flavour for once, sous vide a turkey crown, use the giblets for the gravy etc. 

I also feel it necessary to add that everyone rushes off as soon as they’ve finished eating anyway, there would usually be 8 people in attendance including us and except my mum and brother everyone else leaves, I think it wouldn’t be so bad if we spent the day together after the meal?

1hgo739,AITA for stealing a present from a child?,"Last week was my office holiday party with a White Elephant gift exchange. The party invite was for employees and their significant others, so children were not specifically discouraged but through conversations in the office it was clear that people were not bringing kids. One of my coworkers ended up bringing his 10-year old daughter to the party. She is a regular around the office and he often brings her to work events, but at this party she was the only child.

White Elephant is a game where everyone brings a wrapped gift and the first person chooses a present. The next person can either choose a new gift to open or steal a present that someone else has opened. If your gift is stolen you can choose a new present or steal. 

During the gift exchange, which was light hearted and had a mix of real/silly gifts, someone opened a small hand carved and painted wooden dragon. My husband has played DND his whole life, loves dragons, and this was right up his alley. We had both already taken our turns, but agreed that if either of our gifts were stolen we would go straight for that. 

Along comes the kid’s turn. There were other kid friendly gifts available, but she decided to steal the dragon. Several rounds went by and we debated whether it would be alright to steal the dragon if the opportunity came up. It would be fine according to the rules of the game, but since the kid had it would that make it wrong? We ended up undecided, but leaning toward that it was all a game especially since the kid had stolen the item from someone else. 

Eventually my husband’s gift was stolen so he had the chance to pick a new gift or steal. He made a joke about being the Grinch, and chose the dragon. The kid seemed disappointed, but picked another gift and the game went on. She ended up with a remote control Harry Potter wand that was actually pretty cool.

After the exchange was over, she asked my husband if he would trade items. He said kindly but firmly that he was happy with his item and wanted to keep it. Later, I went to the bathroom and found her crying. I told my husband and we went to her father offering to give her the dragon since we didn’t realize she was so upset. He said that it was a good lesson for her and she had actually talked enthusiastically about stealing gifts from people before the whole thing started. 

My husband has the dragon and is happy with it, but it is now a little tainted by guilt. The office seems to be split on the issue. Many people said that he should never have even considered stealing the item from her because she’s a kid and might not have fully understood the game. We don’t have children so may be out of touch on this issue, but the more I think about it the more I feel like she shouldn’t really have been at the party in the first place, and her father shouldn’t have allowed her to participate in the game if she couldn’t understand the possibility of an item getting stolen.

So I genuinely want to know, are we the assholes?",lauradecker1,3825,0.9599999785423279,423,1734478702,2024-12-17 17:38:22,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hgo739/aita_for_stealing_a_present_from_a_child/,12,2024
1hc7izk,AITAH: My kid wants me to drive 3 hours a day taking them to/from work. I said no. ,"My 20 year old child was offered a job 45 minutes from our house. They have no drivers license yet, and a car that was given to them, but they do not drive due to having no license.

They were just offered a job at a location 45 minutes from our house. Taking them to/from work every day would take me 3 hours. I work from home, and I have responsibilities. Also I just do not want to drive for 3 hours every day. I wouldn’t do that for ANY job. My kid says I should be supportive and drive them, but I am just not going to do it. I told them that this was an unreasonable request, and I’d be willing to do one trip (1.5 hours) only. There isn’t run public transportation here either. AITAH?

Edit: I use the words “child” and “kid” because they are non binary, not because I am implying that they are not an adult.

Edit 2 for more info: They did have a learners permit at one time and allowed it to expire. They did not want to learn to drive with our cars because we have two stick shift vehicles. They have had a car for 4 months that is not a stick shift. A long standing anxiety disorder/therapy is ongoing. We moved to the country(not near public transportation) one year ago from a more urban suburb with public transportation. My adult child does currently have a job 20 minutes away and I spend 1 hour and 20 minutes each day going to/from there. This is due to driving there, going back home (I wfh), then going back later to pick them back up.

Edit 3: For everyone telling me that I need to “check my math” or something of that nature: dropping someone off at work (then going home), then picking them up later in the day (I work from home, so this means driving back to get them) is FOUR 45 minute trips, not two. This is a very basic word problem, and the solution is that all of these 45 minute trips equal 3 hours. 45 x4=180 minutes.

1hlsetw,AITA for telling people I'm not having fun when they ask and I'm genuinely not?,"This one is general. I am a guy who, when I don't enjoy something, I'll tell you I don't, but if I commit to something, I'll see it through to the end without complaining.

This comes to a head where I was on vacation with my older brother in Arizona, who wanted to do a lot of nature hikes. Nature hikes are fine. I don't *mind* them, but I do dislike walking up large hills. Walking downhill is the easiest thing ever, it's like being nature's passenger princess. You just put your foot forward and let gravity do all the work. Walking uphill conversely is very draining and leaves me sweaty.

I don't make a point to complain about something when I do it, so when I was walking uphill, despite not liking it much, I held basic conversation with my brother. 

As we were heading back down, he asked me if I was having fun and I said no. Not because of any fault of my brother, I just didn't find the activity fun. Not even bad, just satisfactory. Later when he was driving me to the airport for my flight home he told me ""If I ask you if you're having fun, don't say 'no.'""

I understand that it can be demoralizing to hear someone's not having fun, but I don't like it when people ask for my opinion and get upset when I give my honest answer. If I'm not having fun, I'll just say I'm not having fun.",Ness_Lucas,3318,0.8399999737739563,39,1735095597,2024-12-24 20:59:57,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hlsetw/aita_for_telling_people_im_not_having_fun_when/,12,2024
1h95fol,AITAH for skipping the bathroom line to wash my hands?,"Basically what the title says - I (30sF) was recently at the airport for a flight. I went to the ladies' bathroom to wash my hands about 15 mins before boarding (so I could have waited). There was a line of about half a dozen women, and I made eye contact with the one at the front of line and told her I was just going to wash my hands. She had no issue with it. There were 2 sections of sinks, and I went to the one closest to the entrance. The next 5 sinks to the left of me were all unused in the time I was washing my hands. 

As I walked out barely a minute later, a woman towards the end of the line cupped her hands around her mouth as if to broadcast to everyone and said in a very condescending tone ""there's a lineeeee"" and laughed at herself. I was so taken aback that anyone had any issues with this that I only managed to mutter ""I was just washing my hands so ..."" as I walked out. I really didn't see an issue with what I did cause I did not cause anyone to wait in line any longer than they would have, nor did I take up a sink that people ahead of me needed. But now I'm not so sure - what is the general public consensus of skipping the bathroom line to use an available sink?

1hc61sr,AITA For throwing out my flatmate's rice cooker and clearing out her part of the fridge after she left the country to go home for Christmas? ,"Me and my flat mates are all uni freshers: me (18), Madison (18), Simon (20), Robert (22), and Liam (19) (all fake names btw). One day, Madison pmed me saying she didn't like how I talked to her in the flat group chat. I'm a very jokey person so though I might of gone too far with my sarcasm, so I apologised straight away. She then didn't reply to my message and didn't come back to the flat for weeks. I got worried as her life 360 was off too.

Simon messaged the group chat:

Simon: ""Yo guys, whose cooker is that? 😅"" (picture of a mini rice cooker).

Madison: ""Mine, lol.""

Simon: ""Inside is only just mould hahah okay.""

Liam: ""Crazy stuff.""

Madison: ""Oh what.""

I gagged when I saw the picture as I remember sitting in the kitchen with her as she cooked that rice. Last month 💀. I took another picture of the rice to send to chat - adding that her avocadoes also went mould and that I few them out. She didn't reply. The next day I reminded her to throw the rice away, it was making the kitchen stink. She responded: ""Has anyone seen my pot?"" 🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️. I pmed her twice reminding her - no reply. I finally caught her at 4 am in the kitchen with her friends. I apologised again to her in person and reminded her to throw away her rice. She told me it was ok and said she would. (she didn't - it was there for another few days) I triple-bagged the rice cooker and left it by the bin, sharing a picture in the chat: ""Madison, please throw your rice away 💀.""

Madison: ""I’m not even there y’all, and I lost my pan."" (she left to go back home for Christmas break in Thailand)

Me: ""Madison, I told you multiple times to please throw that away. It’s a health hazard.""

Madison: ""Bruh, just put it where the vacuum is.""

Me: ""No—it’ll heat up and grow more mould.""

Madison: ""Nah, there’s a lid.""

Me: ""It’ll attract bugs and rats.""

Liam: ""I threw that shit in the bin fr. Was nasty.""

When she left for Christmas, she didn’t clean her fridge section. I threw away food that was going to expire over the holiday, open sauce packets leaking on the shelf, curdled milk, cookies, eggs, and vegetables pooling water. My flatmates said her side of the SHARED fridge was filthy for weeks. I messaged the chat with what I’d done.

Madison: ""K.""

I sent her a video of me clean-up. She complained I was disrespecting her space, claiming the sauces were still fine to eat and expensive. She accused me of nagging and said I shouldn’t touch her side of the fridge area since I don’t use it (I share a mini fridge with Robert). She also said the sauces were expensive. I kinda feel bad for clearing her stuff out, especially as she was having personal problems in her life and was trying to heal. And I did call her a bad word on the group chat  after her ""K"" responses💀.

1hlsety,WIBTAH for not going to my husband’s family’s Christmas?,"I am a first responder and have been for the last 3 years. My schedule is a rotating shift pattern (days/nights). The pattern is consistent and I can tell you what days I’m working very far in advance. Because of this, I told my entire family last year that I would be working on Christmas this year and reminded them when we saw them. This is the first time I have had to work on Christmas. 

My side of the family understands and we are celebrating with just my parents and siblings another day. 

My husband’s family is really into Christmas. Like everyone needs to be at SIL’s house at 8am to open presents together and then we spend the entire day together. So when I asked if we could celebrate together another day over the holidays instead it got shut down with statements like “Christmas is on December 25th.” or “I don’t understand, can’t you just ask for the day off?”  So I let them know my husband would be attending solo this year.

This morning while I was at work, my husband (who works a 9-5 and is enjoying his day off) texts me “it would be nice if you could come by for a couple hours tomorrow after work..”  I declined because:
1. SIL lives ~90mins away, so that’s 3 hours of driving. I would be driving home alone at night with not the best weather.  
2. My job can be very stressful and my social battery is drained by the time I get home.
3. We already agreed that it made more sense for me to stay home and to have him go to his parents house on Christmas Eve so they could drive over in the morning together.. 

Well my husband is pissed and thinks that I don’t want to spend time with his family. He’s been sending me passive aggressive texts all day trying to guilt trip me… “we don’t know how much time we have left with my parents…” It’s working because I feel like I’m letting everyone down and I don’t want his family to think I don’t want to spend Christmas with them.  

WIBTAH if I stuck to our original plan instead of making an effort to go see his family tomorrow after work?

*I am locked out of commenting till Jan 2nd so I’ll just reply here* 

Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond, I was really upset last night and it’s nice to get an outsiders perspective. One of the comments said “it’s not the date it’s the day” and I’ll be using that from now on. A couple of you guessed right, yes, part of my job is answering 911 calls. My husband mostly understanding of how our shifts work but I usually get pushback on long weekend or celebrations. I have been trying to convince him to come in for an observation shift so he can finally understand, but he’s doesn’t feel comfortable listening in on the calls.  

I haven’t confirmed but I think what may have caused him to even request my appearance is that his father, who is in the early stages of dementia, may have asked what time we were both coming over, forgetting I was not coming over.  

This shift schedule is still new to him, and he hates showing up to events without me and having to explain to everyone I’m not there because working. This is definitely something we are going to have to work out before we try and have kids. 

Thanks again everyone and Merry Christmas!

1hkb4ij,AITA for getting my sister chocolate for Christmas after she hasn't put any effort into my gifts?,"Throwaway because my siblings follow my main account. I (18NB) am getting my sister (15F) a chocolate box for Christmas this year because for years now she has not bothered with my gifts at all, Christmas or birthday. Usually she gives me stuff she's been gifted in the past like bathbombs or makeup which I can't use due to skin irritation and also feeling gender dysphoria when I wear makeup. She is well aware of this as I politely tell her when I open the presents. She doesn't have a job and therefore no income which she uses as an excuse despite the fact our parents give her quite a bit of money to buy people gifts for Christmas and birthdays. Last Christmas, she got our stepsister the dress and book she had asked for whereas I got an eyeshadow palette that I had seen her using the week prior and I notebook I had given her for school which she hadn't used. I thanked her for it but later reminded her that I couldn't use the makeup. She shrugged and said ""well at least I got you something"".

What upsets me the most is our dad has a whole thing about us getting gifts for relatives that have a lot of thought and meaning. I say us but it seems this rule only applies to me. I get her the things she asks for every birthday and Christmas. I pay attention when she mentions wanting something in passing and make sure to get it for her when her birthday and Christmas come up. She doesn't.

A few weeks ago, I did my Christmas shopping and I knew she wanted two specific posters for her room but decided because she has made little to no effort for me, I would get her a box of chocolates from Hotel Chocolat. I got a type of box she has said she likes in the past though just because I didn't want to be an utter jerk.

This evening (the 22nd of December) we were having dinner and my sister mentioned she was going out tomorrow to do last minute Christmas shopping. I said ""are you actually going to get me something you've never owned this year?"" as a joke which I realise I shouldn't have. She said ""what's that supposed to mean?"" and I mentioned how she never puts effort into any of my gifts where I always do. Then I said ""well, as I always did"" which was a bit of a dick move on my part. She asked me what I meant and kept demanding to know what I got her for Christmas despite me telling her it would ruin the surprise. Our dad chimed in and demanded to know what I got her so I said ""a chocolate box from Hotel Chocolat"". She went off at me saying that she didn't want a chocolate box, she wanted posters and I responded ""you never bother with my gifts, why should I do the same?"". My dad is saying I need to go out tomorrow and my sister is calling me selfish and ungrateful. I feel quite childish and have apologised to her but she doesn't care.

1hltor3,AITAH for not allowing my mom to stay another week after her pipes burst just before Christmas?,"38/F I am celebrating Christmas with my mom 68/F, my brother 47/M and his family. My mom flew in from out of state and we are driving to a meetup location to spend time with my brother's family - a place in the mountains we all enjoy just for the holidays. All of us live hours away, our mom being the furthest, on the opposite coast. My brother and I are several hours away by car.


This year, we received the bad news that, while my mom has been at my place, her pipes froze and flooded her basement. She is upset, understandably, I helped her get everything started and have her insurance, a cleanup team and a general contractor all working on her place while she is with me. She then broached the topic that she wanted to extended her week stay to ""two weeks or more"". I said no, I need to get back to my regular routine and get ready to return to work. She's welcome to stay here as originally planned, which is until Saturday.


Then she said she may ask to ride back with my brother and his family to their home in another state (opposite direction than me). She refused to ask him until Christmas, so l gave my brother a heads up last night so he has a chance to speak with his wife. I also told him that he's under no obligation to say yes, as she is still welcome to stay with me until Saturday and her insurance company will be footing the bill for most of her stay at a hotel and meals (IF, BIG IF, her residence is uninhabitable, which we do not know at this time).


He told me he didn't have room to take her back with him (3 people in his car and no room for a 4th -assuming luggage is the issue). That I should let her stay with me because she's lonely. I told him I understood that, but I'm not wrong for wanting to cap my time with her at the one week originally planned. He had left that text on ""send"". My mom can be a challenging personality and with this unfortunate development, she's even more ... difficult. I love my mom, but I'm tired. I want my house back and don’t want to be criticized or complained at. I refused to allow my lonely mother to extend her stay with me, despite the recent damages to and unknown state of her home.

1hgo8f4,AITA for telling my mom’s boyfriend his kids will never be family,"Roughly more than a year ago my mother introduced me to her boyfriend. Since then me and my 3 siblings have been introduced to his three kids and our families have been ‘merged’. Though we still live in separate homes, his family is over our house all the time, but it’s very obvious he is purposely leaving me and my other older sibling out of the ‘family plans’. Last year during thanksgiving, I was informed 3 days before that ALL of his kids (including his adult child) and my 2 younger siblings along with my mother were going to meet our grandparents 6 states over. Me and my older sibling were whiplashed as we didn’t have enough time to pull together funds or time off to join them, we brought this up to our mom and she simply said she guesses we can join them next time and she thought we knew. That left me and my sibling alone for a week during thanksgiving, in which we each just ended up going to a family members house who we don’t see often. We were both very hurt by this incident, and brought to each others attention how many ‘family trips’ they have had (whether it’s a weekend thing or not) without inviting us or telling us until the day of. We’ve kept our mouths shut until now, but since Christmas is coming around, we were getting nervous they were going to do the same thing, thankfully they didn’t but we were told to be sure to get his kids gifts as they are now ‘our siblings’. Having to get gifts for 3 people who we aren’t even close to really sucked, but my sibling and I begrudgingly did so. I don’t remember how it got brought up today, but I found out his kids weren’t getting ANY of my siblings gifts, not even the adult despite them all having jobs. This really pissed me off and I ended up lashing out on both of them, specifically my mother’s boyfriend. I told him that I don’t care about him or his kids, but if he wants to play family he’s not playing the ‘father’ act well at all. He retorted with he doesn’t need to share his life with adult kids and to him we’re just our moms past. I’ll admit I got nasty after this, telling him his kids are baggage enough and my mother doesn’t need anymore kids, and I’ll never look at his spoiled rotten brats as family. This seemed to really hurt my mom and she started crying, her boyfriend screamed at me to leave so I did, I’m staying at a friends right now but I’m wondering if I went to far. I don’t give a fuck if I was the asshole to the boyfriend, I already know that part. But was I an asshole to my mom in this way too? I just don’t want her to forget that she has 2 kids who still see her as their mother and she can’t just forget they exist because her boyfriend won’t acknowledge us. 

Edit: I am 20 and the “older sibling” is 17, I only said older because they are older than my two younger siblings who are under the ages of 10. I pay half the rent and half the household expenses in the house with my mother and without me we wouldn’t be housed (I think everyone knows how expensive it is to live on your own right now, let alone with 3 kids excluding myself). I will be going back home and understand he can’t kick me out of a place my names on the lease on, but I am trying to cool myself down. Did this update to clear some things up for people. 

Update: I came home pretty early this morning to have a talk with her mom when her boyfriend left. I took a lot of your advice and told her how leaving me and my sibling out is not blending the family in any manner, and how I feel like my own home is being invaded despite my contributing significantly. According to my mom her boyfriend didn’t end up spending the night due to them having their own fight. My mother made it very clear that she was pretty ignorant to everything we felt, whether it was on purpose or not, but she started crying last night not only from what I said, but everything her boyfriend had said as well. A big part of their talk after I left was discussing me and my sibling, she didn’t tell me everything they said but they will be taking time away from each other for a little while as my mom agreed that at some point he can’t just leave me and my siblings out, but she also feels I was rejecting him and his kids early on along with my siblings and it’s why she didn’t ‘invite’ us to a lot of things because she didn’t want to put us in uncomfortable situations. This led to me bringing up the fact that I pay half the rent and I would prefer from now on they go over his house in the future, and how I need to see respect from him and his kids and not treat me like a ghost in a house I contribute towards. She understood and said that she herself won’t be seeing him for a while. This then ended with her sobbing again that at some point I will be getting married and the kids need a father. Our dad died roughly 6 years ago due to terminal illness, at this point my parents were already separated but since then my mom has really only had flings, nothing serious. And the older I get the more she fears I’ll leave her in the dust and she will have no one to help her with my siblings or the future. (I know a lot of people said this but I thought maybe you guys were just assuming but I guess she was feeling like she needed to secure herself). Similarly, his kids mom has been dead a little less than 4 years for a similar reason though I don’t know all the details. My mother said multiple times that she can’t expect me to live with her forever and take care of her at the drop of the dime, and how she has been wanting a full time companion for a long time for stability but also for companionship. By this point she had to leave for work and we decided to put a pin in the conversation. I don’t think I’ll be updating much further than this. I thank everyone for the advice and the consideration they gave to my post. I still feel like an AH but I do feel a little less shitty setting the boundaries I did considering over half of you said I should have done it sooner.

1h7n5af,AITA for refusing to sleep in pajamas when sharing a hotel room with my BIL,"This past weekend I (25m) was invited to my wife's cousin's bachelor party. We split off into hotel rooms of two and since I didn't know a ton of people there I roomed with my wife's brother. He's a couple years older than me, and we've gone to the gym together and whatnot but have never been amazing friends. 

The first night there was a decent amount of drinking. I noticed when he got into bed that he wore a sweatshirt and sweatpants. I ended up wearing one of those tank top undershirts and my underwear. I don't think he noticed until the next morning when I took off the covers, and he asked if I had anything else to sleep in. I told him I really only brought jeans but I'd be happy to keep them by the bed and not sit around and talk to him like that tomorrow. 

We had some free time during the day and then had a chiller dinner the second night. When it came time to get to bed he pulled out some pajama pants and a cheap long sleeve shirt and said he brought them for me. I told him I'd wear the pajama pants if it was important to him but I wouldn't wear the shirt. He said it was awkward and admittedly my shirt is one of those tight undershirts. But idk why that matters to him. I ended up getting annoyed and not even wearing the pants to sleep and he said that I wasn't being a good temporary roommate, arguing he was doing a good deed by rooming with me and not one of the people he's closer to.

1hefc4l,AITA for refusing to help my sister with childcare after her son bullied mine?,"Throwaway because some of our mutual friends have my main.

So I (28 F) have a four year old son, Max, with my husband, Tom (29M).  Max was born with cerebral palsy and needs some accommodations.  The main two are his crutches for walking and his AAC. An AAC is an IPad/tablet like device that lets him tap pictures/icons to communicate. Just because he can't physically form the words doesn't mean that he doesn't have meaningful thoughts. He operates and communicates just like any other four year old, and likes to talk about typical things. 

  
My sister Jane (30 F) has two kids, James (10M) and Lucy (6F). Jane is a single parent and works longer hours than both me and Tom. To help her out, James and Lucy take the bus to our house every day. We feed them dinner, and make sure they do their homework stuff like that. Jane comes to collect them between 7-8 every night. Well, Wednesday night, the kids were playing as usual when we noticed James start pretending to walk weird, and make strange sounds. It was exactly the way that Max walks and talks. Tom immediately told him to cut it out. 

He kept doing it though, with Lucy laughing. Max started to get upset. Tom called them both out of the family room and scolded them quite severely. He didn't yell or anything, but was firm. James got very quiet and sat at the table until Jane came. 

Thursday, he did it again. When I asked him why he said that ""His mom told him it was okay."" My blood boiled. I told him he could sit at the table for the rest of the night. When Jane got there, Tom and I took her into the other room. She said that she ""didnt see the big deal"" and that he was ""just joking"". I told her that ableism was never funny and if her kid couldn't act right, he wasn't welcome anymore. She said I was being overprotective, and that people were bound to be mean to Max, and he should learn to deal with it early. I told her my four year old should feel safe in his own house and that I wouldn't help her anymore. 

She said I wouldn't dare, took her kids and left. Friday morning I called the school and told them not to send James and Lucy on the bus to my house. They offer an after-school program that you have to pay for that goes until 7 pm. When Jane arrived to pick them up, I told her that her kids were at the school. She flew into a panic and left to get them. This morning, I started getting texts. How dare I? What was I thinking? I reminded her she would have to pay the bill and her tone shifted dramatically. Suddenly she was so sorry and that she would talk to James. I told her that the damage had been done, and they were no longer welcome. She told me she couldn't afford it. I said it wasn't my problem. Now she's really upset, and might have to find another job.

1hc7ofx,AITA for telling my daughter’s father that I will not be doing a Quincenera for her?,"Background: I’m 35(F) and have a 13(F) daughter who wants a Quincenera and I’m not comfortable spending that much money on one event. I’m a Hispanic woman who was born in the US so I’m not a traditional Mexican and my kids are Americanized.

Here’s where the issue comes. My daughter’s father (36) who lives with his mom, pays nothing in child support because he’s in debt(owes IRS/credit card debt). I pay everything for my daughter (school activities/sports/hobbies/clothes/trips) you name it, I pay. I don’t ask her dad because he’s already paying child support for another son he has with an ex. I am fortunate that my fiancé and I make a good income and can afford to be debt free by choosing to make wise money decisions. I have a full-time job, do contract work on the side, and part-time Masters student at my local University (debt-free).

My ex approached me when I dropped off my daughter and said that our daughter wants a Quince and she wants a party where all her family is in one place. I told him I wasn’t doing a Quince but I’d throw a party in our backyard and he was invited. Our house is nice and our backyard was done a few years ago and is big. The other day he said that his cousin had a baby shower at a ranch style and that its $3K for the venue for 250 people. On the phone I freaked because I have a lot on my plate and know how much work it takes to plan an event with a lot of people. He said his family is easily 100 people. I have a lot of family too but I was only planning on only inviting close family and friends. When I tell him ""No this is not a Quincenera but a party with food and DJ with tops 100 people"" he tell me that ""I'm starting to really disappoint him"" and I tell him that I have a lot going on and that I can’t plan something that big with all the stuff I already do and that I don’t want to spend a lot of money. Quinceneras are a lot when you think of the dress/dolls/walce/damas/band and etc. they are time consuming and a lot of money goes into them. He gave me $200 the other day and was planning to give me $100 each pay day. He’s never given me that much money for her since we separated when she was 1.

I have final exams this week and I haven’t been able to sleep for 2 nights thinking of all the stress this is causing me. Should I give him his money back and tell him that we should each do what we can for her on our own? He causes me stress and I swear talking to him is pointless because he makes me feel like I’m the bad person.",Kooky_Excuse_1557,2138,0.949999988079071,631,1733960754,2024-12-11 17:45:54,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hc7ofx/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_father_that_i_will/,12,2024
1h6sdc5,AITA for not letting my sister-in-law live with us indefinitely?,"My (36F) husband's (38M) sister (28F) recently went through a tough breakup and asked if she could stay with us temporarily. She has a history of being irresponsible, often quitting jobs and relying on family to bail her out. My husband convinced me to let her stay for **two months** max, with the understanding that she would get a job and start saving for her own place.

At first, things were okay. She mostly stayed in the guest room, but she quickly started pushing boundaries. She began ""borrowing"" my clothes and makeup without asking, cooking elaborate meals and leaving a mess, and inviting friends over late at night without letting us know.

I confronted her about these things, and she apologized but didn’t change. The real issue started when she made **zero effort** to find a job. She spent her days watching TV, ordering takeout, and complaining about her ex. My husband and I both work full-time, so we’d come home to a messy house and her lounging around.

Last week, I sat her down and told her that since it’s been **three months**, she needed to leave in two weeks. She broke down crying, saying I was being heartless and she had nowhere else to go. My husband sided with her, saying I was being ""too rigid"" and that she just needed ""a little more time.""

I told him that if he wanted her to stay longer, he needed to take responsibility for her—meaning he’d need to handle her meals, clean up after her, and manage her behavior. He got defensive and said I was ""making this into a power struggle.""

Now, my sister-in-law is telling the whole family that I’m kicking her out while she’s ""struggling,"" and they’re calling me selfish. I think I’ve been more than fair, but my husband is still upset with me, and I’m wondering if I’m being too harsh.

1hcxi0a,"AITA for refusing to give up my seat at a family gathering because my cousin is ""too old to sit on the floor""?","So, a bit of context: I (19F) am really close with my extended family. We often have big gatherings, and everyone typically sits in a large living room for dinner and hangouts. The seating arrangement usually consists of couches, a few chairs, and a couple of bean bags. There’s also a large rug where people sit on the floor.

Yesterday, we had a family dinner, and I ended up on the comfy couch by the window. It’s the prime spot in the room – near the food, great view, just perfect. My cousin, Myra (38F), was sitting on the floor near me with a few other people. Myra has always been a bit dramatic about things, and she started complaining that she was too old to sit on the floor anymore. She made a whole big scene about how her knees hurt and how no one had the decency to offer her a chair.

I don’t want to sound mean, but I was really comfortable and didn’t want to give up my spot. I jokingly said, ""I’m also not getting any younger and my back hurts, but this is where I’ve been sitting all night."" Myra kept insisting that I should give her my seat because she ""deserves it"" and ""it’s the least I can do."" At this point, I was getting pretty frustrated because, honestly, she wasn’t the only one sitting on the floor—there were at least 4 other people down there, younger and older, who were managing just fine.

I told her I wasn’t moving, and that she could either join the others on the floor or figure something out. This led to an awkward silence for a while, and eventually, my aunt (Myra’s mom) pulled me aside and scolded me for being rude. She said it’s family, and I should be more accommodating.

Now, I feel like maybe I was being too harsh. On one hand, Myra’s being dramatic about her age (she’s not *that* old), but on the other hand, I can see how it might’ve come off as inconsiderate. My cousin still won’t let it go, and I’m wondering if I was out of line.

1hltjs4,AITA For writing my siblings out of my will?,"For context, my brother (30M) and sister (25F) have lived very far from me for a long period of time (for me), going on a over a decade now. They never bothered to include me as a sibling growing up and have continued the tradition into adulthood. Contact is sparse at best, and only when initiated by a mutual 3rd party, never voluntary on their end, and all attempts from me are ignored. I have received a medical diagnosis that isn't looking good and I wanted to ensure that, should the worst come, my affairs would be in order over the next few years. I updated my living will recently (family doesnt know i have one) and struck them from it, barring them from receiving anything, instead leaving assets to my parents with instructions on their provisioning.

Friends have told me that I'm being harsh and I should include them, but I hardly know them any more and any interactions have been largely negative over the past 10-15 years.

1hls0os,AITA for parking next to a car that parked on the line?,"I’m blown away by this opinion and need to crowdsource validation. 

Tonight, I drove CVS to pick up popcorn for a Christmas movie with my kids. I parked in the closet open parking spot to the door. 

When I get out, I notice the car next to mine was very close. I had to squeeze through a cracked door just to get out (Note: I made sure I did not touch their car with my door at all). 

I double-checked to see if I parked poorly and I was right in the middle of the spot. However, the car next to me was on the line. Not over the line, but the wheels were touching the line.

For context, I have a Chevy Bolt, a small EV car. The other car was a midsize suv, like a Toyota RAV4.

I didn’t think much of it. My kids were waiting and I wanted to get in and get out.

When I come back, the owner of the other car is checking for possible dings (presumably from my car door opening). They were about to get in when they saw me walk up to. Then, we had this interaction.

Them: Is this your car? 
Me: Yes, it is.
Them: Why did you park next to me when there are so many other spots? *there were other open spots in the row behind our cars*
Me: I just parked in the closest spot to the store.
Them: You’re so close to my car when you could have parked anywhere else. 
Me: I’m parked in the middle of the spot and you’re on the line.
Them: If I ding your car with my door, “it’s more your fault than mine”.
Me: You’re car is on the line.
Them: “That’s not really relevant.” *says as they gets in her car*

Am I the asshole here? I never would have thought to check if the cars on the other side of me had parked well before I pulled in.

TL;DR: I parked next to someone whose car was on the line, making our cars very close. They said it’s my fault if their door dings mine since I could have parked elsewhere.

1hk8gy4,AITA For telling my mom to stop letting my brother get away with stuff just because he’s autistic?,"
I (18F) am the youngest out of three siblings. My oldest brother (22M) has autism. He doesn’t understand like everyone else does and is extremely smart in certain categories. Feelings are not one of them. He doesn’t understand when he does something wrong, and when he doesn’t get his way, things get out of hand.

My father has been on my side for most of this. My brother, who we’ll call Leo, always got his way. He has one cell iPhone, three iPads, a computer, a laptop, a playstation, xbox, wii, etc. I on the other hand have one iPhone and that’s it. When he gets angry, he smashes and breaks his stuff. We have had to replace electronics more than I can count. I tell my mom not to give in, but she tells me off.

She always has the same excuse. “Your brother is autistic, he doesn’t understand!” or “When you grow up you can get a job and start a family, he can’t.” And yes, the family thing is true. But she shouldn’t give in all the time. I tell her he’s not going to learn or that he doesn’t deserve it. I asked her for a monitor for my birthday, and instead I got books. She made up the excuse that we didn’t have the money, but the same day she gets him a new iPad. Which was over $1500. I realized that thats the reason she said no, was so she could get him that on my birthday.

Recently, my family has yelled at me for being “inconsiderate” and “selfish” for expressing how I feel. I don’t know if I should stop trying to speak out and try to stop them from giving into his behavior.

1hhelb4,AITA backing out of all social events because 1 person I don't like is there,"Throwaway for privacy. I need a truly impartial judgement because everyone I've asked has some skin in the game and is mixed on view.

I (25F) don't like this girl Ellie (28F). I also work with her, at one of my two jobs (important for later). I think she's annoying, wayyyy too performative and I've also caught her telling random lies to our coworkers. I don't like being around her and only interact with her at work if I have to. 

Me and my group of friends were out at a bar a few months ago and Ellie coincidentally was there. She walked over to me to say hi and is now part of my friendship group. All of my friends know how I feel about her, have heard her crazy behaviour at work and why I don't like to be around her. However, the majority of them like her (we're a group of 9) and she's been embraced.

Ellie is a part of our group chat. Most of the time when we make plans, she comes too. I brushed it off the first couple of times but now I've decided not to go to anything where she's also coming. Because I work two jobs, I only have 1 day off a week/fortnight it varies depending on shift patterns. I really value that time and decided I don't want to waste it being around someone I don't like. I've never tried to play the hand of me being in the group first or issuing an ultimatum to pick one of us, I just decline and sit at home. 

As a result, I see my friends about once a month instead of a few times a week (after work when I have energy or on my day off) because I don't want to see Ellie for 8 hours where I can't stand her and then proceed to be in her presence for the rest of my evening. Everyone in the friend group has picked up on it and constantly invite me to plans where Ellie is also attendinng but I keep my stance firm and decline. 

My two friends who like her the most, Grace and Jess, are calling me childish and say I'm forcing them to choose between us but I insist I'm not and I'm happy staying at home (I really am, I can't stand Ellie). They keep calling me to change my mind, even created a separate chat to talk about it but I don't budge and they think I'm being an asshole about it and I should just be a bigger person and go anyway.

1hfw5cz,AITAH for skipping Thanksgiving to avoid my cousin’s fiancé? ,"I (27F) am very close with one of my cousins (30F) but I’m not a big fan of her fiancé. They’ve been together for 5 years and at family events he’s either a total grump, he’s drunk or both. 

On Thanksgiving night my family always has the Charlie Brown Christmas movie on in the background after dinner to kick off the holiday season. The volume is almost 0 and it’s just on in the background, we don’t sit around and actively watch.  2 years ago he complained about it being on even though it’s not loud and the football games had already ended when we put it on. 

Last year, he showed up drunk (pretty much belligerent and was slurring words) and he immediately started being rude to my cousin when she tried to give him water instead of beer and he complained about the movie so much that we changed it even though he was in the kitchen and  it was playing in another room. After an hour, I went and put Charlie Brown back on because I love watching it and he wasn’t paying attention so I thought he wouldn’t notice. 

I moved the tv controller under a pillow so he couldn’t change it again and when he realized it was back on he freaked out and started yelling for someone to change it. No one said anything but some of my family members were looking in my direction. Then he full on yells at the table I’m at and told me to “turn the fucking movie off!” One of my brothers got up and told them to leave and he and my cousin left right away. 

He apologized after but my cousin acts like it didn’t happen. It was really jarring to have someone yell and curse at me. 

This year, I skipped thanksgiving because I didn’t want to deal with him and I’m still not comfortable being around him. My aunt and uncle were upset that I didn’t come and tried to guilt trip me. I’ve seen him and my cousin at other events this year and we were cordial. I kinda feel like the AH because I hid the remote but I think I was justified in skipping in thanksgiving. My 2 brothers have been on my side since it happened and so have my other cousins.

1hedkxt,AITA for Refusing to allow a Recent Widower to have his Annual Christmas Party in my house?,"So we recently bought our house from a man with 2 kids who lost his wife a few months back and had to downsize. We didn’t speak to him much throughout the moving process but recently he sent me an email telling me that he and his kids are really struggling with the move and the loss of his wife. He said that his wife loved Christmas and used to throw a big holiday party every year for the neighborhood and his current house is too small. He said he wanted the holidays to be normal for his kids since it’s his first Christmas without his wife. He asked if he could throw it at our house in 2 weeks and he said he’d pay for and deal with everything and that he could probably use things we already have to decorate.

I feel really bad for the guy but there’s a few reasons I need to say no. The first 3 are not that important but the last one I would say is. Firstly, 2 weeks is very short notice. Second, we’re Jewish and have absolutely zero Christmasy decorations, third the day he said is my husbands birthday and I’d like to celebrate with him that day. All that stuff is kinda petty and can be worked around. 

But we recently got relicensed as foster parents in our new house and a little over a week ago took in two young kids who recently went through a very traumatic life event. I’ve taken off work the next month to stay home and support them. I don’t know how they’ll be in two weeks but I don’t want to confirm that they’ll be ready to have a lot of people over and interact with them. I’ve only left the house with them twice for a little over an hour each time and both were not pleasant experiences. I don’t know if they’ll be able to be out of the house for hours during the party in public or in someone else’s house.

Right now my family is my top priority and I understand his is too which is why it hurts that I have to say no to him. I’m not asking if I should or shouldn’t, I’m not going to say yes. I’m just asking if it makes me an AH. I feel like if I talk about my foster kids he will suggest ways around it and I don’t want to give him the full sob story with everything he’s going through.

1hiujuq,AITA for asking a kid to please get off my porch and trying to find out where they came from?,"Reposting since I think it got deleted? Not sure how this works since this is my first one of these.
  So for reference, I (41 F) have generally had a cordial relationship with my neighbors, we don’t talk too much but we talk when we see each other or we need to discuss property stuff. 
  This afternoon I was out Christmas shopping and my security camera notifications start going off like crazy. I looked and it was someone’s kid (roughly 3?) on my porch, pulling on some of my decorations, then I saw them open my mailbox, and pull on the door handle. I saw no adults in sight through the camera. I immediately call my neighbor to see if it’s one of their relatives, no response. 
  I call through the camera speaker and ask the kid to please not play with things on my porch, they didn’t listen. I asked them to please go back to their parents. They stayed on the porch for like 10 minutes and I gave up. Finally I get angry texts from the neighbor, I guess it was a relative. They simply responded with “they’re just a baby”. I said, “look, all I saw was some kid I didn’t know on my porch opening my mailbox and playing with things while I wasn’t there, and it was stressing me and my cat inside out.” They got angry and said “ok cool, hey never ask us for anything in the future. He’s a baby and was just admiring your decorations” clearly pissed at me. 
  Was I in the wrong to be upset that there was a random child on my porch and trying to figure out who they were? I get the kid was young and curious but I personally would never let my kid go up and play on someone’s porch when they weren’t home or without permission?

1h9vit9,AITA for being the only friend/spouse not to show up to help out friends move out of their house? ,"My husband(30m) belongs to a friend group of like 6 guys and their SO’s. They were all his high school buddies. I(27F) get along well with all of them, although we’re not friends outside of my husband. Occasionally the gfs/wives will do something together without the husbands but it’s rare. All of us have kids. 

Today my husband heard that Couple 1 has until tomorrow to be completely moved out of their house so he showed up to their house to help them move out. We have a 1 year old who doesn’t sit still and a few months ago we helped Couple 2 move but I was absolutely useless and in the way because I had to watch our kid and couldn’t be moving furniture or anything because of everything around to get into. 

Needless to say, I did not go help them move today. I’m also 18 weeks pregnant. Well today all of our other friends showed up. All of them! Which is great and I’m glad they had the help, until Couple 3’s wife sent me a snarky text about how everyone showed up except for me and it says a lot. I told her I’m not very helpful when watching our kid and she replied that they all had kids there and it wasn’t an issue for anyone else but good excuse. 

Everyone else’s kids are years older except for one who is only a month old so all he does is sleep. I feel like I’m being judged unfairly and Couple 1’s husband just tweeted about knowing who your friends are because of who shows up for you on your time of need. 
I tried to defend myself further to Couple 3’s wife because also pregnant so I’m not lifting stuff, but she had the excuse that couple 4’s gf was there and is also pregnant. Like that’s great but she’s 5 weeks along and just found out two minutes ago and also doesn’t have a toddler to watch on top of it.

1hlrwqq,AITAH-My 17 YO sister has ruined my christmas break ,"UPDATE: The car is returned, but I have not talked to my sister since. 

So, I am a first year college student. I’m a pre-nursing student who finished with good grades. If me saying i’m a first generation student helps then there it is. I have been home for about 2 weeks and have absolutely hated it. I’m back here with my fiancée but other than that i’ve had no real reason to feel happy being here. My family is very poor, I am fortunate enough to have a car because I am in college and live hours away. I have earned this car by respecting my parents and keeping up great grades while doing nearly every extracurricular activity offered in highschool. My sister on the other hand has had two cars. The first one wasn’t very nice so it has some mechanical issues, the second one she crashed and it is now totaled. Since then, she has not stopped talking about getting a new car. I worked my entire highschool career and believe it helped me in many ways. She has yet to get a single job and i can see how different me and her are. After she talked about the brand new expensive ass car she wanted for “college”, I told her it was unrealistic. I told her our family is poor, and we can’t afford brand new cars. I told her you will need to get a job and earn a car, and also get your license. This made her go ballistic. She called me many names such as narcissistic, spoiled, and unworthy of life. My heart actually shattered. I have never done anything in my life to make her say these things to me. I have drove hours and spent so much money on my sister to only get this back. I have tried so hard to love her. I just began crying after she told me these things outside of my grandparents house. Later in the day, she has my car. I begin to panic because i do not trust her with my car. It’s a 2017 Ford Escape and it is my only source of transportation to college. If she wrecked my car, I’d have to buy a new one myself. I text her and ask her to come home please, very politely. She then tells me she is busy and will not return my car. I continue to text her and politely tell her to return my car. The only thing she says next is “i really wish you were dead.” This happened around 30 minutes ago and I still feel like I got shot in the heart. I’ve never felt so much internal pain in my life. It’s also christmas eve, and my parents have done nothing to calm the situation. She talks to me, and my parents this same way and i can’t do it anymore. I left the house to go spend the night at my MIL’s house because i can’t stand to see her after this. How am I going to open presents and give presents in the morning knowing that my sister thinks of me this way. I just wish i lived a different life at this moment and don’t know what to do. She has not tried in school, she has done nearly nothing to respect my parents and has done nothing to prepare for her future. I just don’t know what to do.

1hi6kk3,AITA for leaving my Mom's place after seeing how messy it was?,"Growing up, our house was always messy, as my mom has a hoarding problem. There were always cardboard boxes in the living room, junk everywhere, and dishes in the sink. Over time as I grew up, I realized this isn't normal, especially as I inherited these ha its which lead to roommate conflict (me being messy) when I went to college, habits I'm actively trying to correct. 

That being said, my mom just moved from a 3 bed down to a 1 bed apartment, now that my sister and I have moved to college. I was thinking this would be a great idea, a chance for her to start fresh. I wasn't going to fly home for Thanksgiving originally, but she told me that she needed help moving, so I came. That week was hell. My room had became a storage unit for the past few years since I left, filled to the brim with random boxes of junk. The garage was even worse as we had to rent a uhaul and drive it to the dumpster four times to throw away boxes of papers from 20 years ago, broken furniture, and random junk. It was a constant fight of me convincing her she doesn't need all this and we have to throw it away. We ended up running out of time to finish it all before I had to leave, but made enough progress that I figured she would be alright. We got everything she was going to keep all ready in the new place, set up the furniture, but left a few boxes left she needed to unpack. The main thing left to do was clean out the old garage and throw all that into the dump. She promised that when I got back, the apartment is gonna look great as we spent so much time talking about where furniture would be, decorating the walls, and all.

Fast forward, I come home for Christmas, she picks me up from the airport with my bag and get home. Holy. Shit. It was just like the old house. Filled with shit from the garage to the brim. There are pathways that go from the door to each room, everywhere else is filled. Kitchen is nasty. Smells like dog pee. I couldn't handle it, and walked out immediatly without saying anything. Had a drink at a bar down the street, called my gf, and went back just to grab my bag after she fell asleep, and drove to my Dad's to stay there. Haven't spoken to her since and I'm not sure when I'm planning on it.

My whole childhood I rarely had friends over. We rarely held family events. Living in that mess really messed with my mental state more than I realized at the time. Because of this, I tend to be messier than average, but am doing every possible thing in my power to not be like her. Whenever I visit home for the past few years since I moved away, I never spent the night there because of this.

1hkz735,AITA for not allowing my daughter to quit piano?,"Over the summer, my daughter Annie (14) asked for piano lessons. My wife and I were surprised since Annie had never shown any interest in music. But Annie assured us that she was serious. Since she’s a straight A student, we didn’t doubt her.

It's also important to note that my wife and I have a rule that our kids can participate in any (reasonable) extracurricular activity, but they have to stick with it for a year/season before they can quit.

Annie started lessons in right as the school year started. She practices for at least an hour every day, and her teacher has spoken positively to us about her dedication and rapid progress.

Earlier this month, my wife and I went to the end-of-semester recital that Annie’s teacher requires his students to perform in. We thought that she played beautifully, but during the car ride home Annie told us that she wanted to quit piano. I asked why, and she said that she was embarrassed because a. She played the same piece as a 6 year old and b. Emily played a well-known Chopin piece. 

Emily is Annie’s former best friend. Since both girls are very competitive and were always at the top of the class, they went from friends to frenemies. AFAIK, they still hang out in larger group settings but not one-on-one.  

I reminded Annie of the ""no quitting before a year"" rule and suggested switching piano teachers if she wanted to avoid playing during the same recital as Emily. But Annie said that it didn't matter if she switched teachers because Emily already knew how ""bad"" she was at piano.

Thankfully, my wife is 100% on my side here, but several family members who are w/ us for Christmas have said that I should let Annie quit piano.",CarefulSalt5503,1171,0.9200000166893005,448,1734993087,2024-12-23 16:31:27,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hkz735/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_to_quit_piano/,12,2024
1hhfj72,AITA for asking my cousin not to eat my food?,"My (25m) cousin (24f), let’s call her Amanda, has a mental impairment, so she acts about 6-8 years old. She is also a very picky eater, which makes holidays hard for her, and she usually just eats the rolls, and maybe a few bites of whatever the meat is. Her mom, my Aunt Wanda, never brings anything for her to eat despite knowing what food will be there (we have a family group chat so people don’t bring the same or similar foods) and what my cousin won’t eat.

Another cousin (23f), Elizabeth, has a severe dairy allergy, and her sister (28f), Cameron, doesn’t eat gluten. They always make and bring their own food. I am vegetarian and avoid dairy as much as possible, I always make and bring my own food, and eat what I can from what the rest of the family brings. Our family is respectful of our allergies and dietary needs, and does not eat what we bring for ourselves, so we don’t cook a lot since it’s just the three of us. 

At Thanksgiving, Elizabeth brought DF/GF mashed potatoes and gravy, Camille brought salad and a veggie tray with DF dip, and I made a box of DF/GF mac & cheese. I didn’t think Amanda would want to eat the macaroni because it’s not what she’s used to (Kraft or Valveeta), and it does obviously taste different from standard macaroni. She’s very sensitive to small flavor changes like that. 

We had our allergen-free food on a separate table, so people didn’t accidentally take our food when there were larger portions of the same food but with the allergens in them. The only thing that we had that the rest of the family didn’t was the mac & cheese. When all the food was out, Amanda saw the mac & cheese and went straight to our food table. I let her know that it was DF/GF and was for just me, Elizabeth, and Camille, but if she wanted to try some and have some after we get our servings, she could. 

Instead, she ignored me and scooped up HALF of it onto her plate. I asked her to put some back because it wasn’t fair to take all that when I made it for the three of us. She started screaming and crying saying that it wasn’t fair that we have our special food that she can’t eat, when there’s hardly any food for her to eat, and no one makes food just for her. 

I knew with her being in that state that reasoning with her wasn’t going to work, so I didn’t say anything. Her mom came over and took her to sit and calm down. She took one bite of the macaroni, didn’t like it, and threw the plate on the floor. Her mom took her into the kitchen and they made a box of Kraft macaroni for her to eat. Later, my Aunt Wanda told me it was inconsiderate of me to make food Amanda would think she likes, and that I “forced” my aunt to make her food while everyone was eating. 

AITA for asking her to wait until we got our food before taking some for herself?

1hgo1et,AITA for announcing my pregnancy to my family? ,"My sister in law (37f) has been trying to get pregnant for almost three years now and have had a very rough and tough time trying to conceive. It has always been a sensitive subject around the family and my husband (29m) and I (29f) have held back from having our second child due to this reason. 

We wanted to give her the chance to have a child before we tried for another one. We always wanted to have our first child to be closer in age with their next sibling. Our little one is turning 4 next year and we said now is the time. We tried and had a miscarriage. A month after that we are all happy after knowing we are pregnant again!

Overjoyed by news I shared the news to the family. SIL was upset on how I shared the news and family was pretty in the middle.. ultimately I can’t share my pregnancy to anyone until after my first trimester so I don’t hurt SIL feelings. 

A week after that happened, I shared a story on my social media of a funny skit of a pregnant woman wanting to eat healthy but her pregnancy cravings is telling her to eat chocolate instead. SIL was so upset and told everyone she won’t be attending Christmas with the family. And that I wasn’t understanding her and how hard it has been for her. 

 At this point, I just don’t even want to be pregnant… so people could stop making me feel bad for even expressing any small thing about pregnancy. 

Edit: I shared my good news through our family group chat that we use to communicate with each other. And I also shared it with my over seas friends on my social media when the baby was due.

1hdotbc,UPDATE: AITA for leaving in the middle of dinner because of pumkin pie? ,"Hello, 

Since I always wonder what happened to the people who post on here, I thought I'd give a brief update. 

When I wrote that post, I was mentally in a pretty dark place. I think I needed someone, even if it was a stranger on the internet, to validate my feelings and listen. And commenters on here did listen and took the time to write advice that made me think, so thank you.  

Most of you were right, my post was not really about pumpkin pie or cheesecake. The underlying tension between me and my mother has always expressed itself through fights over trivialities and long silences. Many of you have asked me why I, as a thirty year old woman, still go to these events. I’ve asked myself the same question and realise that there is no reason for me to be there. My brother and I do not get along (we never have) and my mother has brought this onto herself. I will be spending Christmas elsewhere. 

However, I feel like my post might have portrayed my mother in an unfair light. I know it does not matter, since you are here to judge a conflict and not a person, but some of the comments seem to assume my mum to be a nasty and mean bully. She is not. She can be very kind and very generous and has done a lot of good for people through her work. She is also terrible at expressing emotion, frustrated by retirement and herself had a very difficult childhood. Our relationship has not always been this bad, and I too have been cruel to her in the past. 

In regards to the actual quarrel: I have sent only a short response to my brother since thanksgiving, ignoring mum's texts. She called yesterday and seems to be hellbend on buying me new shoes. She rarely apologises. I am not strong enough to keep hoping she changes. 

I will address the topic of my childhood with my therapist. 

Happy Holidays everyone.",throwaway3747434,1090,0.9300000071525574,84,1734130864,2024-12-13 17:01:04,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hdotbc/update_aita_for_leaving_in_the_middle_of_dinner/,12,2024

1hefulh,WIBTA if I don’t call out of work on Christmas Eve to go to family dinner?,"So 3 weeks ago, I (20F) started working at Target and on my 2nd day of work, I had to call out because I woke up throwing up. A team lead talked to me about my call out the next day I came to work. I’m scheduled to work from 2-9:30pm on Christmas Eve and my mom isn’t happy about that because we are supposed to go to my Grandparents house for dinner like we usually do every year. She told me that I’m going to have to call out but I don’t want to risk getting in trouble since I recently already had a call out. I was also hired as a seasonal worker since that’s what they had available and I’m trying to have them keep me permanently and if I call out again, especially on a holiday, that will affect my chances of them keeping me. 

My mom got mad because I said I didn’t want to call out and she started guilt tripping me and saying “it’s messed up that you won’t be at family dinner” “I can’t believe your going to go to work on Christmas Eve” “I don’t understand why you can’t just call out so you can have dinner with the family”. This would only be my first time not going to dinner and a few of my older cousins won’t even be there because they are busy with stuff. WIBTA if I don’t call out of work?

1hhdasf,AITA for screaming at my aunt to get the hell out after she called my little sister “Miss Trunchbull”?,"Using throwaway account because I know some of my family are on here. Sorry for any grammar issues English is not my first language.

My (17f) aunt (40f) and nieces (10f and 6f) came over to our house for a visit.

My nieces and my little sister (8f) were playing around the house. They were chasing each other around, I think they were playing tag.

Me, my dad, and my aunt (who is his sister) were sitting at the kitchen table drinking coffee when my sister and oldest niece ran past us. My sister was chasing after her. My aunt suddenly yelled out laughing, ""Don't fall on her and squish her, Miss Trunchbull!""

My sister and I had just rewatched the movie Matilda a couple weeks ago, but I didn't really get the connection until my sister suddenly got very quiet before going to her room in tears.

I looked up the character again on my phone and it clicked. I jumped up and started yelling at my aunt, that led to a screaming match between the both us until she grabbed her kids and left.

My aunt has always been almond mom to her daughters, always saying weird stuff that she ""has to keep them skinny"" and that she'll make sure they're models one day. She has made remarks before to my sister that she eats too much.

My little sister is chubby, not obese, but still chubbier than most of the kids in her class. She has gotten bullied for this before and is insecure of her weight. My aunt knew this since my sister genuinely loves her and talked to her about it before.

I couldn't wrap my head around why she would say something so hurtful. I went to my sister's room and she was crying. She asked me why she can't be beautiful and it broke my heart.

My parents said I overreacted, but I heard them talking in their room about how disrespectful it was that my aunt said that. I'm still grounded regardless.

It's been a week since then but my aunt called last night and basically said she won't see us until I apologize. Now, my parents are urging me to say sorry.

I feel like I was right to have stood up for my sister, but at the same time so I don't want to lose connection with my nieces. I'm really confused if I should apologize or not because maybe I did overreact. I just don’t know.

1hbc5pn,AITA for Refusing to Let My Brother and His Wife Name Their Baby After Me?,"(Throwaway because my family uses Reddit. Names are fake, but the situation is very real.)  


Hi Reddit, I (32F) am currently in a weird situation with my brother, Jake (29M), and his wife, Rachel (28F). They’re expecting their first child, and everyone is super excited. I was too — until they told me about their name choice.


Last weekend, Jake and Rachel made a big announcement. They said they had ""finally picked the perfect name"" for their baby girl. **It’s my exact first and middle name.** Let’s say, for the sake of this post, my name is Emily Rose. They want to name their daughter **Emily Rose [Last Name]** — identical spelling, too.  


At first, I thought it was kind of sweet, but then Rachel said, “we just love how it sounds, and it’s such a strong, classic name.” I asked if they were naming her after me, and Rachel laughed awkwardly and said, “not really, we just love the vibe of it.” So, they’re not even honoring me — they just like my name and want to copy it.  


I told them I was uncomfortable with this. I said it felt weird to have a niece with my exact name and that it might cause confusion in the family. My mom agreed that it was odd, but Jake brushed it off, saying, ""you don’t own the name, it’s not that deep.” Rachel added that I should feel ""flattered,"" not ""territorial.""  


I tried to suggest some similar alternatives, like Emma or Emilia, but they shot down every suggestion. Jake said “we’re set on this name, and it’s happening whether you’re on board or not.” I told them if they go through with it, I’m setting a boundary: I won’t answer to my name at family events if someone calls it, because I’m not playing the ""which Emily are you talking to?"" game.  


Now, Jake and Rachel are calling me petty and immature. My mom says I’m being dramatic, but my dad actually agrees that it’s weird. My friends are split — some think I’m making it a bigger deal than it is, while others say it’s bizarre and creepy.  


To be clear, I know I don’t own my name, but I just think it’s strange to name your kid after a living relative and not even acknowledge that connection. They’re acting like it’s some random, once-in-a-lifetime idea they came up with on their own.

1hedo87,AITA for not gaining weight for my sisters wedding so she would feel thinner?,"So to provide context, about a few months ago, my sister, (23F) and I (19F) were both slightly overweight. Not exactly fat but we both would have handled losing 20ish lbs. So eventually I started working out and eventually lost 25 lbs, and I was very happy with myself and actually started to feel confident again. However, my sister had a busier schedule and she never found time to consistently workout. I knew she felt insecure about that because I was noticeably skinnier than her, but we both were able to move past that for a while, until she got engaged. Once she got engaged she really tried losing weight but was never able to lose more than a few lbs, and she was really stressing about that to the point where she would have meltdowns about it. Eventually our mom, 43F came to me and started telling me about how much my sister struggles with her body image, and said to me that she thought I should gain back the 25 lbs for the wedding, because if me and her were together for pictures she would look fatter than me, and she was really worried about that. I refused to do that because I worked really hard to lose weight and I wasn't going to lose all my work. However my mom was very mad at me saying stuff like if I loved her I needed to do what would help her, even if it is hard. I still said no, and my mom then told my sister and she has been ignoring me and my mom said that I could no longer be the maid of honour if I didn't gain the weight.

 the issue with this move however, which i did 
after threatening my stepdad about numerous times, is that now i no longer see my siblings very much. my siblings , who are very young, really seem to miss me, as does my mother. i know it hurts them that i barely ever come around there. recently, there have been talks from my mother that my stepdad feels remorse and wants me to give it another shot, but i refuse these proposals and stay at my father's.

1hcx4hb,AITA for giving my niece a piece of nicorette?,"Hi Reddit, I need help figuring out if this was just a miscommunication or if I'm in the wrong.

Over thanksgiving I was visiting my fiance's family. We had a great meal, and afterwards I was really wanting a cigarette, but I'm trying to quit so I pulled out a piece of nicorette to kill the craving. My soon-to-be niece (19) Hannah saw me chewing and asked if she could have a piece, and I said no because it was nicotine gum. She got an attitude and went to her mom Cathy and said I wasn't giving her any gum. Cathy told me to giver her some gum, and when I was trying to explain why I didn't she interrupted me and said it's fine, just give her a piece. I figured Hannah used nicotine too and I gave her some.

Cut to 30 minutes later, Hannah is on the couch turning absolutely green. She's complaining about being dizzy and eventually runs to the bathroom to throw up. Everyone feels sorry for her and assumes she ate too much, so she spends the rest of the evening on the couch while we play games and hang out until it's time to go. On the drive home my fiance said it really sucks that Hannah got sick, and I brought up that it seemed like she got nic sick from the nicorette I gave her. My fiance looked at me and asked why I gave her a piece and I said because Cathy said it's OK and I assumed Hannah smoked or vaped or something.

Apparently Hannah has never has as much as one drag from a cigarette, so the 12mg she got from the gum rocked her world. My fiance called Cathy to tell her what happened and now her whole family is saying I'm an asshole, I'm a bad influence, and calling me all kinds of bad names. I tried to defend myself by saying I told Hannah it was nicotine gum and that Cathy interrupted me when I tried to tell her, but everyone is still saying it was my fault for giving it to her.

I think Hannah lied to her mom to get me to give her some gum so she would seem cool or because she wanted to try it, and she's definitely old enough to know better but everyone thinks I'm in the wrong.
