1jw3hht,CMV: Many Americans have no grasp on reality and it’s largely why we’re in this mess.,"I was talking to my boyfriend the other night about how Americans have become so soft. Now I’m not a conservative by a long shot, I’m very much on the left. But I was talking about how if the civil rights movement or the movement for women’s suffrage had happened today, those groups either wouldn’t have achieved their goals or it would have been *way more* difficult because people just seem so apathetic and uncaring.

This led me into saying that I really think a large majority of Americans have no real grasp on reality. Sure, if you’re in true poverty or are homeless in this country, that’s absolutely gonna suck and will be a horrible and traumatizing experience. However, most people who make an average salary are doing fine. Sure, you’ll probably need a roommate in more expensive areas and I do think that’s an issue, but still… even living with a roommate in an apartment is like… fine (at least to me).

Americans are so landlocked and separated away from any countries that experience *true and intense* hardships, that I really do believe we’ve come to the ideal that not being able to buy what you want all the time is the biggest hardship of all.

I think the amount of wealth that can be gained in this country really messes with people’s perception of what is normal. It’s normal to need a roommate, it’s normal to live in a smaller house, it’s normal to have to budget. But because we see people living extravagant lifestyles, we believe that somehow… through sheer force of will, we could also get there.

I also think it makes normal salaries that are fine amounts of money seem “small.” Like, I make 70k and I live in a large city in Missouri, but it’s really a mid sized city compared to others in the country. I live in a nice apartment building, can pay my rent and bills, and still buy and do things I want every once in a while. But somehow people have decided that 70-80k is still… not that much money?

I think Americans have been sold a lie that we can forgo social services in the name of being a country where you can *possibly, but probably not* make all the money you could ever dream of and more. If we had subsidized healthcare, parental leave, etc we probably wouldn’t feel the need to make over six figures, but people have decided that it’s more important to possibly be able to become a billionaire than to have services that would actually relieve stress and money issues.

Americans don’t want to admit that maybe they’ll be average for their whole lives and that is ruining us as a country.",MissHannahJ,5722,0.8999999761581421,587,1744305936,2025-04-10 12:25:36,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jw3hht/cmv_many_americans_have_no_grasp_on_reality_and/,4,2025
1kbowjo,CMV: The MAGA hat is the modern equivalent of a Nazi-era swastika armband,"Now, to be clear, I'm not claiming that MAGA supporters are Nazis, or that the U.S. today is equivalent to 1930s Germany.  But I am arguing that the MAGA hat serves a similar *s*ocial function to the swastika armband during the Nazi rise to power.  Both are symbols worn in public to signal loyalty to a political movement grounded in nationalism, identity politics, and authoritarian leadership.

[Research shows that political symbols shape group identity and public perception](https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/8/6/50).  The swastika armband marked allegiance to an ideology that promoted ethnic superiority and rejected democratic norms.  The MAGA hat, while originally a campaign slogan, has become strongly associated with anti-immigrant sentiment, misinformation, and efforts to undermine democratic elections.  [FBI data shows that hate crimes rose significantly after Trump’s 2016 election. ](https://www.newsweek.com/hate-crimes-under-trump-surged-nearly-20-percent-says-fbi-report-1547870) Studies from [Pew ](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/07/18/americans-say-the-nations-political-debate-has-grown-more-toxic-and-heated-rhetoric-could-lead-to-violence/)and [SPLC ](https://www.splcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/yih_2020_final.pdf)(Southern Poverty Law Center) indicate that MAGA-drive aggressive language by politicians makes violence more likely, correlating with spikes in xenophobia and political violence.

While the MAGA hat doesn’t carry the same historical weight or scale of atrocity, it increasingly functions as a marker of political tribalism and fear for marginalized groups.  Like the armband, it defines an “us” and a “them.”

I’m open to counterarguments and clarification. Change my view.",ansyhrrian,4502,0.800000011920929,864,1746040799,2025-04-30 14:19:59,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kbowjo/cmv_the_maga_hat_is_the_modern_equivalent_of_a/,4,2025
1kb1fjd,CMV: A factor pushing young men to the right is the lack of left leaning media that appeals to traditional males and their interests.,"Put a simpler way it's very difficult to find a good podcast on topics like hunting, fishing, fixing cars, agriculture, ect that isn't hosted by people with a conservative bend. And even if you go in with intention of ignoring any political comments when you're listening to or watching someone for hours each week then their views will begin to influence you whether you realise it or not.

A friend recently showed me a few episodes of the John Oliver show and while I found it interesting I kept getting pulled out of it by long, drawn out monologues about how horny he is for horses, or how much he wants to sexually assault star wars actor Adam Driver, or even multiple jokes about how scary making phone calls is. Needless to say but for your typical tradie scared of phone ringing is not relatable humour.

I don't think people realise the gap in culture between inner city office workers and more rural trades people, even little jokes that pop up constantly in modern entertainment like ""if you're part of generation ... you'll never own a house"" or ""if you're under 30 you don't have to pay attention because our next piece is about home ownership"". Most of my mates are in their 20's and already own homes so even these types of comments create a sense of unrelatability. 

So in summary I believe what could be considered mainstream left leaning humour and entertainment doesn't appeal to a lot of young guys and that is why they are flooding to people like Joe Rogan and other more conservative entertainers, because at least they're talking about something the guys are interested in.",New-Perspective6209,3869,0.8399999737739563,2491,1745967132,2025-04-29 17:52:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kb1fjd/cmv_a_factor_pushing_young_men_to_the_right_is/,4,2025
1jubiil,CMV: The 2024 Election could have been stolen and there is enough evidence to start state level investigations.,"Hello Redditors,

I’m fairly new to Reddit and social media (I know, super late to the game), so **forgive me if this post is too long or doesn’t obey some sort of Reddit norm that I don’t know about.** 

I was responding to a post in r/AdviceAnimals yesterday, and I found some of the reactions to my comment a bit odd. Based on the level of evidence I've read - I believe the 2024 election could have been stolen.

I was told that there’s *“no evidence”* that the 2024 election was stolen. That it’s all baseless. That it’s over, and that people questioning the results are anti-democratic. Pretty odd given the guy who occupies the White House still denies the last one. 

But here’s the thing: when you actually look at the data (unlike the last election where there really was no data to support any sort of fraud, and yes, I looked), public records, and even the statements made inside the White House after the election, a very different picture starts to form. I’m not saying this definitively proves the election was stolen, but if this isn’t at least worth investigating, then what is? 

I’ve tried to summarize the major facts so far as objectively as possible. Let me be very clear here: **I AM NOT A LIBERAL, BUT I DO DESPISE DONALD TRUMP AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY.**   
  
I consider myself a diehard centrist or even a radical independent. There are things I agree with Trump on, things I agree with Biden on, hell, I even agreed with SOME of RFK’s stuff on food additives and such. I really strive to look at every issue independently. Now, also to be clear, I despise Donald Trump because he is a low-quality human, he implements his ideas like a mobster in the 1970s and he's turned people into douches, BUT I’m trying not to let this bias impact my assessment. 

Let me lay out the evidence that at least warrants examinations of the cast vote records in all swing states and audit each of the ballot counting machines, including any software updates that could have been done before election day.

**1. Trump’s Own Statements**

On January 19, 2025, during a pre-inauguration rally in Washington, D.C., Donald Trump expressed gratitude towards Elon Musk for his support during the campaign, particularly in Pennsylvania. He stated: 

“He journeyed to Pennsylvania where he spent a month and a half campaigning for me… and he’s a popular guy. He knows those computers better than anybody. All those computers. Those vote-counting computers. And we ended up winning Pennsylvania like in a landslide.”  

Then during a FIFA World Cup announcement, Trump veered from soccer talk to politics when reflecting on how the United States secured hosting rights during his first administration. ""When we made this, it was made during my term, my first term, and it was so sad because I said, can you imagine, I'm not going to be President, and that's too bad,"" Trump said. ""And what happened is they rigged the election and I became President, so that was a good thing.""

Sure, Donald Trump is an idiot and says incoherent stuff all the time, but two incidents and one directly referencing the “vote-counting computers” do seem extremely fishy, especially given the work of the Election Truth Alliance or ETA.   
  
I’ve seen some Reddit posts criticizing these guys, but I’ve listened to the few videos they’ve produced, and they don’t have that same aura of bias that the election deniers from 2020 had. But again, this absolutely is circumstantial evidence at best – I think hearsay would be the appropriate classification, but these comments do and Trump's past statements about the 2020 election being rigged establish motive. 

**2. Clark County, NV**

Let’s move on to Nevada. The Election Truth Alliance analyzed the Cast Vote Records (CVR) from Clark County, raw voting machine data publicly available, and found multiple quantitative anomalies that demand answers.

*a. Drop-Off Voting Discrepancy:*

A “drop-off vote” is when someone votes for president but skips down-ballot races. This is normal, but here’s the twist:

• Trump had a +10.54% drop-off rate.

• Harris had just +1.07%.

That’s a 10X discrepancy. Why would Trump voters overwhelmingly skip Senate races but  
Harris voters didn’t? That’s not just odd, it’s statistically glaring and does not line up with past trends from other swing states. In fact, in Pennsylvania in 2024, the drop-off rate was around 5% for Republicans, and in 2012, during the Obama v. Romney campaign, the drop-off was 6% for republicans. In other words, **10% is wildly high.** 

*b. Early Voting Tabulator Anomalies:*

In early voting, the more ballots a tabulator processed, the more predictably skewed the results became:

• At tabulators with <250 ballots, Trump and Harris showed reasonable variance.

• **But above 250 ballots, results converged tightly around Trump 60%, Harris 40%, across the board.**

Human voting behavior doesn’t do that. You don’t get rigid clusters from tens of thousands of individual choices unless something artificial is influencing the result - perhaps a software update from some future DOGE employees? I don't know, but it certainly seems that Elon and his group of wunderkids have the means to do something like hack into counting machines or deploy a software update to them to manipulate them.

*c. Different Voting Methods = Different Realities:*

• Mail-in ballots: Trump got just 36%.

• Early voting machines: Trump got 59%.

• Election Day ballots: Trump at 50%.

How can such wild swings exist by the voting method alone? If you believe in clean elections, you have to ask, why would someone’s preference change that drastically based on how they vote? Again, circumstantial evidence here, but these do not line up with historical averages at all.

All this isn’t opinion. It’s right there in the official public CVR data. And we haven’t even gotten to Pennsylvania yet. Granted, it takes some time and will to really read through and understand this stuff – but my god, if something is worth your time, it’s making sure that who you vote for actually counts. If not, then it’s the entire ball game. 

**3. Pennsylvania**

Pennsylvania is where historical voting patterns were flipped on their head, and no one seems to be asking why.

Traditionally, urban centers like Philadelphia vote Democrat, and rural counties lean Republican, but in 2024, heavily Democrat precincts saw abnormally low turnout, while swing counties reported turnout higher than registered voter levels in some cases.

ETA flagged precincts where:

• Ballots cast exceeded 100% of registered voters.

• Votes for Trump outnumbered total ballots submitted, based on county reporting timelines.

• Tabulation errors were “corrected” days later with no audit trail.

Are these smoking guns? No. But they’re not normal either. And in any functioning democracy, these would be red flags triggering mandatory investigations, not media blackouts and certainly not blind ignorance or calling people who question the results, anti-democratic. 

Ask yourself this: if the exact same anomalies had helped Harris win, if he had unusually low drop-off rates, suspicious clustering in early voting machines, and skewed turnout in major cities, wouldn’t the media, Trump himself and half the country be screaming for investigations?

Wouldn’t Republicans be marching in the streets, demanding transparency? You know they would.

But somehow, when the data points in favour of their guy, suddenly, the response is, “Shut up, conspiracy theorist.” Unlike the 2020 election, there is a straightforward narrative you can paint, using data and logic, that is downright diabolical if it is true.

I strongly encourage folks to go have a look and read through the materials themselves. The one thing the Election Truth Alliance is doing is providing comprehensive documentation on their efforts, unlike many of the election deniers from 2020. 

And please, if you review this material and then say, “Hey, you’ve misinterpreted something,” – change my view, please, because this is truly exhausting.

1jz4zpk,CMV: The culture war is functionally over and the conservatives won.,"I am the last person on earth who wants to believe this, and I feel utterly horrified and devastated, but I cannot convince myself that anything other than a massive shift towards conservative cultural views, extending to a significant extreme is in the cards across the anglosphere, and quite possibly beyond, and maybe lasting as long as our civlization persists.

Before last month, I wasn't sure, I thought that there could be a resurgence, a strong opposition at least, or failing that, balkanization into more progressive and more traditional societies.

Thing is, all of that hinged on one key premise: that this was completely ineffective on recruiting women, and that between the majority of women and minority of men still believing in institutuons and civil liberties recovery was possible. Then, I saw something, the sudden rise of Candace Owens in a celebrity gossip context. She now controls a lot of this narrative, and it's getting her views from women. SocialBlade indicates that about 10% of her 4 million subscribers therabouts came from the last month, and the pipeline is real. Her channel has shockingly recent content regarding a ""demonic agenda"" in popular music as well as moon landing conspiracy theories (to say nothing of the antisemitism and tradwifery I already knew was wrong with her). A lot of women may end up down the same pipeline as their male counterparts due to the front-end content, and it scares me.

Without as much opposition, I'm terrified of the next phase of our world. Even if genocide and hatred are averted, I fear in a few decades we'll have state-enforced religion, women banned outright from a lot of jobs, science supressed via destroying good research and data, a ban on styles of music marked 'satanic', and AI slop placating the populace and insisting it's how things ""should be"", and with algorithms feeding constant reinforcement, I don't see a path out of this state of affairs. Please change my view.

1k1jw4u,CMV: Kilmer is absolutely dead.,"Here is why I think he is dead and there is no possibility of his being alive. This administration has nothing to lose by letting his lawyer (who only has power in the US) confirm that he is alive. Same for letting the senators that visited see him. No condition that he is or conditions in the prison could be worse than him being shipped off and literally murdered there. Even if beatings/rape/slavery were the case, he is still being held in a prison in his country of origin and they could make some kind of justification for his remaining there. Evidence of his being alive doesn't give US judges, senators, lawyers any more power to get him back but would allow the Trump admin to benefit by them saying ""see liberals - you're overreacting because he is alive.""

Please convince me that this poor soul is still alive. Because my beliefs are terrifying.",PumpkinEatrr,2184,0.8199999928474426,900,1744914224,2025-04-17 13:23:44,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k1jw4u/cmv_kilmer_is_absolutely_dead/,4,2025
1jza96b,CMV: Donald Trump should be removed via Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution,"Section 4 of the 25th Amendment states:



""Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.



Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.""



I believe the President's Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office using this section. The 25th Amendment would also give cover to the Senate and the House to determine that the President is mentally incompetent, especially if there is evidence to support it. So it's safer for Congress to use this method instead of impeachment, because they can say that they support Trump, but that he ""lost his mental capacity.""



\*\*I think Congress would also be in their rights to hold votes through secret ballot as well, because they would like to protect their families from retaliation from an irrational President, who has shown a willingness to retaliate against anyone he perceives to be his enemy (\[see the attempted assassination of Nancy Pelosi by a supporter of his attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer in their home\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack\_on\_Paul\_Pelosi)), and who does not comply with the Rule of Law, or Due Process under the Constitution.\*\*



I think this would be a powerful argument because Trump's irrationality is self-evident through his own actions. For example, he is ignoring the advice of experienced experts in the government, he's instituting tariffs and rolling tariffs back, he's not following due process, and he's acting very irrationally. There is an unprecedented attack on our system of government, and there needs to be a determined and legally justifiable response to oust Trump, as soon as possible.



Through the 25th Amendment, the process would proceed as follows:







\- The VP and a majority of the Cabinet write a letter to the Senate President & House Speaker stating that Trump is not mentally competent, and the VP will assume the Presidency



\- Trump writes a letter back, stating that he is mentally competent, and attempts to take the power back



\- The VP & Cabinet write another letter stating that he is not mentally competent, and prevents him from taking the power back



\- The Senate and House must convene within 48 hours and rule by a 2/3 vote that Trump is or is not mentally competent within 21 days, this can be done by secret ballot for the safety of members of Congress







This is a historic moment, and I believe drastic steps need to take place to save our system of government. This is a legal method. :) People need to use their personal and institutional influence to lobby for this to happen, because our systems of government are under attack and we are at risk of losing everything.

1jslh6d,CMV: Muslims are afforded a right to be bigoted in a way other groups aren’t.,"In my experience, Muslims in the West are given almost a carte blanche to be as hateful as they please, in a way that no other group is. For example, Charlottesville was universally condemned. Nobody was justifying the angry mob yelling that Jews will not replace us. On the other hand, when Muslim students organize riots on college campuses that are in support of a terrorist organization that is racist, sexist, antisemitic, and opposed to western values, people call it free speech.

A study was published recently that showed that people were more likely to be in favor of the deportation of a European student for harassing Jews than a Palestinian/Muslim student who engaged in the same behavior. 

It seems like society is so afraid of being called Islamophobic that Muslims end up getting a free pass for behavior that wouldn’t be acceptable from anyone else. People oppose homophobia, unless it’s the Muslim city council in Michigan passing a resolution to ban gay pride flags from public property.

The MeToo movement was very talked about and of course people stood against r*pists and sexual assault. Then October 7th happened and suddenly everyone was blaming Jewish women for being sexually assaulted by Muslims or accused the victims of lying for gain.

This plays out in very dangerous ways, too. People fall into a bigotry of low expectations with regards to rampant human rights abuses in Muslim countries. People storm the streets for women’s rights in the west, but are silent when it comes to middle eastern women being forbidden from the most basic rights, such as the right to even speak out loud or choose what to wear. 

For years, and especially since October 7th, people have said that Muslims/Palestinians have a “right” to be bigoted against Jews because of perceived grievances. Those same people would never excuse antisemitism from a white person.

1k2w2c4,CMV: We are witnessing the end of Pax Americana in real time,"For context, I am not American and these are my views from the stance of a person living in a Western nation allied to America.

**1. The end of the American economic order**

Donald Trump's tariffs are from my POV, completely insane. Each of their stated goals are completely contradictory from each other, way too broad and universal to have any of the useless effects a properly though-out tariff policy would have, and target many of America's allies. Not only that, when Trump started the trade war with China, they completely crumbled against the pressure and exempted China's key hi-tech industries and are begging Xi Jinping to call the White House for a ""deal"". With bilateral trade basically not existing anymore, China can still source a lot of their US imports (which from what I gather are primarily agricultural products) from other countries, but America is screwed as they relied on China for a lot of renewable and computer tech. The dollar is weakening, and China is sitting on a ton of the USD reserves they can unleash to seriously damage America's ability to finance its debts.

I really don't want to be a doomer, but the US really seems to be in a precarious position. It seems like America wants to achieve autarky and isolate from the global market, but it seems like they are approaching it in the worst way imaginable as they are simultaneously weakening their's and their allies' positions while strengthening China's. We're not even past 100 days of Trump's presidency.

**2. End of the rule of law in America**

With Trump ignoring a Supreme Court order, the judiciary is left with no enforcement mechanism to make the executive comply. That just leaves the legislative branch as the final check through impeachment, but I very much doubt this will happen even if the Democrats sweep the midterms. The Trump administration is literally wiping their ass with established norms and the rule of law, and the worst part is that it seems that a sizeable portion of the American public is either ambivalent or supportive of this.

I won't go as far as to say that this will cause a civil war down the line, but I do believe that if this trajectory continues, then America is looking at an extremely turbulent period that I would imagine would be akin to the Years of Lead in Italy. Combined with the economic troubles that I mentioned earlier, it seems very likely for America to become even more insular, unstable, and even authoritarian.

**3. Geopolitical Instability**

America has completely abdicated any semblance of responsibility over being world police--case in point, Ukraine. Now, I very much recognise that the merits of being world police is a debatable topic, however, I think its just a fact that--irrespective of whether or not you think America has the moral duty to ensure a fledgeling democracy is not invaded by an imperialist power--I think that it just makes good geopolitical sense to ensure Ukraine wins or at least stalemates against a nation that is actively hostile to Western interests. The only conflicts that Trump is willing to take sides with seems to be countries that he has personal financial interests in (I think he has or at least wants to build a Trump tower in Moscow although I might be wrong on that and he definitely has assets in Israel for example).  
  
If, tomorrow, China declares war on Taiwan, it seems very unlikely for the US to lift a finger. All it takes is one direct encroachment into what used to be America's red line, and the world will find out that the America giant has fallen asleep again.

**Conclusion**

All in all, it is very hard for me to be optimistic about the longevity of American hegemony in the 21st century. I have personal gripes about America and the imposition of their will in my home countries' politics, however, I still do believe they are LEAGUES better than the alternative of China or Russia or any other nations in the ""axis of evil"". Trump has completely set alight the power of America--both soft and hard--for no apparent reason. He is not only dumb, in my view, but also weak. Even if you take the MAGA movement's purported goals at face value and agree that they are sound, they have achieved none of it. Best case scenario is that the current Trump presidency is just a bout of insanity that will take years to recover from. Worst case is that Trump has set alight a fuse to a bomb that will blow up in all of our faces some time in the future and end the American hegemony for better or worse.

1k43r3m,CMV: Citizens United was the worst thing to happen to the American political landscape,"Ever since the Citizens United v. FEC decision in 2010, I’ve felt like the integrity of American democracy has been steadily deteriorating. The ruling essentially said that corporations and other outside entities can spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections, under the banner of free speech. To me, that decision opened the floodgates to unchecked political spending, dark money, and disproportionate influence by the ultra-wealthy and powerful interest groups.

I believe this has led to:

	•	Unaccountable Super PACs spending billions with little transparency.

	•	Candidates beholden to donors, not voters, because campaigns are now insanely expensive when they likely wouldn’t be if Super PACs weren’t in bidding wars for ad time. Don’t even get me started on how some people in office can’t be bothered to attend a town hall with constituents. 

	•	Distorted public discourse, where those with the biggest megaphones (and more money than any reasonable coalition of voters could amass) shape the narrative.

	•	Widening political cynicism — many people feel like their vote or voice doesn’t matter when billionaires and corporations can outspend entire communities.

1k1ivtj,CMV: the American Left is too disorganized and decentralized to be of any use against MAGA,"There's an old saying about politics in America: when it comes to politicians, the Left has to fall in love, while the Right falls in line. It’s a huge generalization (the first of many I’ll make here), but there may be something to it.

The Left likes to mock MAGA for being idiots, but they have POTUS, 2/3 of SCOTUS, a congressional majority, and the world’s richest men who just so happen to control the most powerful media corporations. Who exactly is the party of idiots here?

This domination of government didn’t happen by chance; it’s the result of decades of careful planning by conservative organizations. The Right is excellent at branding; they come up with a bumper sticker slogan and they all stick to it relentlessly, regardless of how counterfactual it might be. Call them sheep, but they know how to organize.

The Left, on the other hand, is a circular firing squad ready to slaughter any of their own who don’t pass an ideological purity contest. (See the opposition for Biden/Harris on Gaza even when Trump made it abundantly clear he would bulldoze Gaza.). If the Right is a pack of wolves (or sheep) the Left is a pack of cats, utterly useless at organization.

The Left is great at theatrical protests, and terrible at actually getting anything done. Take the Tesla protests for example. Why would you film yourself throwing paint all over a Tesla dealership? You go to jail, possibly get slapped with domestic terrorism charges, and they wash the paint off the next day. It’s pure theater. 100% attack, 0% damage.

They could accomplish far more if they weren’t so focused on theatrical protests. Tere are only 160 Tesla stores in the US. It would be easy to find 160 individuals willing to sneak by in the dead of night with a squirt gun full of paint thinner and do far more damage without getting arrested, but that would require some degree of organization. \[\*NOTE: I'm absolutely 100% NOT advocating vandalism or any other criminal activity. I'm just pointing out that I’m an average schmuck with no activist credentials and it took me less than 30 seconds to come up with a solution that would be more economically devastating than what these feckless clickbait slacktivists have done.\*\]

Occupy Wall Street is another great example. It was very theatrical, and made for great TV, but what exactly did they stand for? What did they accomplish? There was no unified message, so it was too easy to divide and conquer, and the movement accomplished basically nothing.

The Right has been proactive and is very well organized. The Left is reactive and disorganized.

They have tried to impeach Trump twice, and it did not work. 

If impeaching Trump for actual CRIMES did not work, then the constitution has NOTHING else to enable the removal of a US president. 

He would literally have to kill an innocent person on video to be successfully removed from office. 

Incompetence, greed, selfishness, gross negligence, ignorance, egomaniacal, general scumminess, ruining the economy and foreign relation, even actual fascism will NOT be enough to remove Trump, because American laws for removing the president is so weak that nothing sort of an actual horrible crime (murder, rape, treason) can lead to a successful prosecution and removal. 

A ""No confidence"" vote is not a thing for the American presidency. 

""But sir, surely actual fascism is enough to remove the President, right?"" -- I don't think so, because by then it would be too damn late and all the laws will be changed to keep him in power, Nazi style. 

It's relatively easy to vote someone into the presidency but ridiculously hard to remove them before their end of term. 

Trump could literally turn America upside down and inside out, dragging the world down with America and STILL remain in office.

1jvpmw6,CMV: The “gifted” programs in the early 2000s did more harm than good for most kids in them.,"I was part of a “gifted and talented” program in elementary and middle school during the late ’90s/early 2000s. At the time, it felt special — we got pulled out of class for enrichment activities, harder material, or independent projects. But looking back, I honestly think it screwed a lot of us up.

It gave kids a false sense of superiority without teaching real-world skills like effort, resilience, or how to fail. We were constantly praised for being “smart” rather than working hard, so when we eventually hit a wall (college, jobs, burnout), we didn’t know how to handle it. A lot of the kids I knew from gifted programs now struggle with anxiety, perfectionism, or a fear of mediocrity.

Meanwhile, it often created unnecessary separation from other students and didn’t actually prepare us for adult life — it just made us better at standardized tests.

I’m not saying all enrichment is bad, but I think the way gifted programs were handled back then set a lot of us up for emotional whiplash.

Change my view.

1jsmudk,CMV: There were no protestors paid to attend the protests across the us yesterday.,"Looking at the republican subs as well as their media I've seen a lot of talk about paid protestors. Rogan famously quipped that protestors were being paid $1400 each to protest.

I've seen zero evidence of this occurring. 

Some criteria for my claim. 

What is a paid protestor? Someone who is paid to go to a protest. 

What this doesn't cover? Organizations do exist and often engage in logistics. They may print signs or bring in sound equipment, etc. This is different than the claim that protestors were being paid to attend the protests across the us yesterday. 

Organizers are not protestors. Here's why. J6 was organized by women for America first. A pro trunp organization led by Amy Kremer. This group worked on securing permits, booking speakers, getting a stage and sound system, etc. This does not mean that Amy Kremer paid those present at January 6th, and the January 6ers were also not paid protesters. 

Women for America first is also not a non profit organization which means it is far less transparent than other groups that are doing similar logistics. Unlike many non profits. The origins of the funding for Women for America first have never been disclosed. Really. We have no idea who paid for January 6. However, even in this extreme example I wouldn't argue that J6ers were paid protestors. 

What would change my view? Evidence anyone attending the protestors yesterday was being paid for protesting.

1k957mq,"CMV: Modern medicine is far better than “all natural” remedies, and it’s dangerous to pretend otherwise.","Why do people act like going “all natural” is the better option today, when we have modern medicine that actually works and saves lives? I keep seeing these naturalists pushing herbs, oils, and “remedies” as a cure for everything — but back then, people used these “remedies” and  died young from infections, childbirth, and simple injuries. There were no antibiotics, no sterile surgeries, no trauma care. Nature was brutal back then. 

Now that we finally have the tools to fight diseases — yes, even if they’re “unnatural” — people suddenly want to throw it all away and go back to herbs? This is exactly how Steve Jobs died. He refused surgery for something treatable and chose the “natural” route — and it cost him his life.

Social media doesn’t help either. You see all these clean, aesthetic posts advertising herbal remedies with dramatic testimonials, and people fall for it.

1kbrkch,CMV: The United States would be a more just and united country today if the Union had imposed draconian punishments on the Confederacy after the Civil War,"This is a follow-up/enhancement to a recent post on this subreddit titled ""CMV: The American Civil War should have ended with mass executions"".  I thought that post was a good start, but I wanted to take the idea even further.  
  
The failure of the Union to decisively dismantle Confederate ideology and power structures after the Civil War was a critical mistake that enabled white supremacist terrorism and regional grievance culture to persist for generations. If the Union had treated the Confederacy as a treasonous insurrection and responded with uncompromising punishment—including executions of leadership, long-term military occupation, land redistribution, and the criminalization of Confederate symbols—then I believe the United States would today be a more socially just, racially equal, and politically united country.

**Context**:  
After the Civil War, the federal government pursued a relatively lenient policy toward the defeated South. Confederate leaders were not executed; many quickly regained political influence. Efforts to protect the rights of freed slaves during Reconstruction were eventually abandoned. This led to the rise of the ""Lost Cause"" mythology, the creation of Jim Crow laws, and racial terror groups like the KKK. Confederate monuments were erected decades later, and even today, states fly Confederate flags and debate whether the Civil War was ""about states' rights.""

I think all of this could have been prevented—or at least severely limited—if the federal government had acted more decisively in the 1860s and 70s.

**My Argument**:

If the Union had enacted a policy of **total dismantling** of the Confederacy—not just in terms of military defeat, but cultural, political, and economic erasure—the following benefits would likely have emerged:

1. **Abolition of Confederate Identity**:
   * Confederate leaders like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee could have been publicly tried and executed for treason.
   * Confederate flags, monuments, and songs could have been banned by federal law.
   * Southern schools and churches would be required to teach a pro-Union, anti-slavery narrative—preventing the Lost Cause myth from ever taking root.
2. **Lasting Protection of Black Civil Rights**:
   * A prolonged military occupation (20–30 years) could have kept Black voters, landowners, and politicians safe.
   * Land formerly owned by slaveholders could have been redistributed to freedmen.
   * A Black political class might have firmly taken root, with long-term representation at all levels of government.
3. **Economic Restructuring**:
   * Plantation landowners could have been dispossessed and barred from regaining political or economic power.
   * Northern industry and capital could have modernized the South with infrastructure and industry under federal control.
   * The region’s economy might have been diversified away from white-dominated agriculture much earlier.
4. **Suppression of White Supremacist Movements**:
   * Early iterations of the KKK and similar groups could have been ruthlessly dismantled by federal troops with legal authority.
   * Sympathy for such groups would be viewed socially and legally as treasonous rather than defensible under ""heritage.""
5. **Long-Term National Unity**:
   * The regional divide that still influences U.S. politics might have faded with a clearer victory and forced ideological realignment.
   * Racial grievance and Southern exceptionalism would be stigmatized and discredited early.

**Anticipated Counterarguments** (feel free to challenge these):

* “That level of punishment would’ve caused long-term insurgency.” → Possibly, but the South was already devastated; firm occupation could have prevented armed uprisings more effectively than leniency did.
* “You can’t force ideological change through punishment.” → Post-WWII Germany and Japan suggest otherwise—firm restructuring paired with education and democratization *can* work.
* “That would’ve been authoritarian and un-American.” → The Confederacy waged war to preserve slavery. The response needed to be just as morally clear and uncompromising.

**Change My View**:  
I'm open to hearing why this path would not have led to a better America. Would it have backfired long-term? Are there moral or practical limits to federal authority, even in the wake of treason? Would another approach have been more effective?

1k355md,"CMV: If a person is misled about someone’s age and engages in consensual sex with them, they shouldn’t be charged with any form of sexual assault or rape if they acted in good faith.","I want to present a perspective that I believe is often overlooked, and I’m curious to hear differing opinions.

Let’s say you’re a 21-year-old at a bar, a place where everyone is assumed to be of legal drinking age (21+). You meet someone there, they seem to be around your age, you flirt, and after some time, you both decide to hook up. Later, it turns out that the person you had sex with is underage — let’s say they used a fake ID or somehow misled you into believing they were of legal age.

In this situation, I don’t think the person who engaged in consensual sex should be charged with rape or sexual assault, assuming there was no malicious intent or clear signs of deception from their side. The individual who misrepresented their age is the one at fault, not the person who was misled.

Some points to consider:

Context matters: A bar is an adult venue, and the environment signals that all participants are of legal age. If someone enters that space and behaves like an adult, it’s reasonable to assume they are of age. There’s no obligation for a person to demand birth certificates or additional verification if everything else in the environment suggests they’re dealing with an adult.

Deception is the issue: The primary concern here is deception. If someone is underage and uses a fake ID or lies about their age, they are the ones responsible for the situation. It’s unreasonable to expect a person to be a mind reader and figure out someone's real age based on superficial details.

Personal responsibility: I understand the importance of personal responsibility, but in this case, the responsibility to verify should fall on the person who is actively lying about their age, not the one who is unknowingly misled. It’s not the person who acted in good faith based on the circumstances who should face criminal charges. It’s the one who created the false narrative.


I get that there are emotional and psychological impacts in situations like this, but I believe those impacts don’t justify criminalizing someone for acting based on the information they had at the time. In these cases, the law should focus on punishing the deceiver who used fraudulent means to mislead another person, not the person who was deceived.",ManasJain11,1305,0.8799999952316284,484,1745093430,2025-04-19 15:10:30,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k355md/cmv_if_a_person_is_misled_about_someones_age_and/,4,2025

1k1od4a,CMV: Voting Republican today is a fundamentally inhumane act.,"Over the past several years, I've come to believe that the modern Republican party—and by extension, many who support it—actively vote against the wellbeing of vulnerable people. From policies on healthcare and education to the way marginalized communities are treated, I see a pattern of cruelty, apathy, and an unwillingness to engage with the broader impact of their votes.

This has led me to a cynical conclusion: Republican voters either don't care about others, lack the critical thinking to see the harm being done, or are simply echoing the beliefs of their social circles without deeper examination. I’ve struggled to see meaningful counterexamples, and I worry that “conservatism” today is less a philosophy and more a brand that people follow blindly.

I know this is a harsh stance—and I’m open to being challenged on it. If I’m wrong, I want to understand how. Are there values in today’s Republican voting base that prioritize humanity? Can voting Republican in today’s political climate still be morally defensible?

1jzxel2,CMV: MAGA and the new conservative movement that grew from Trump will fracture and die with him,"I don’t think the MAGA movement survives Donald Trump.

Not in the form it exists today, anyway. Trump didn’t just ride a wave of conservative populism, he became the wave. What we now call MAGA isn’t built on a platform or a coherent ideology. It’s built around a man. When he’s gone, politically, physically, or otherwise, I think what’s left will split, fracture, and ultimately lose most of the energy that made it so dominant.

The reason I say this is because, to me, MAGA is less of a movement and more of a cult of personality. Trump provided something the American far-right hadn’t had in a long time: a charismatic figurehead willing to be as loud, unfiltered, and combative as they are. He validated and amplified the angriest corners of the conservative base, the folks who for years felt ignored or dismissed by traditional Republicans. But I don’t see anyone else in his orbit who commands that same visceral loyalty. Ron DeSantis, JD Vance, Nikki Haley, they’re all trying to echo Trump’s style, but none have his draw. Without him at the center, the movement loses its gravitational pull.

I think we’ll see a power vacuum emerge when Trump is no longer politically viable. And history shows us that these types of vacuums rarely end with a smooth transfer of influence. Movements that are too centered on one figure often fall apart when that figure exits. Think of Ross Perot and the Reform Party, or even what happened to Perónism in Argentina after Juan Perón died. The infrastructure might remain, but the energy and direction falter.

I also think there’s a deep split coming, one that already exists beneath the surface, between the wealthy class of MAGA supporters and the working-class base. The rich Trump-aligned figures, the political insiders, donors, and media moguls, are in it because his presidency was good for their business or their access. They’ll move on and try to back whoever keeps the cash flowing or the tax breaks coming. But the working-class voters who saw Trump as their voice? I don’t think they ever really got what they wanted out of him. They got attention, but not much meaningful policy. Without Trump himself feeding that sense of rebellion and grievance, I suspect that wing of the movement will struggle to remain relevant, or at least unified.

So my view is that once Trump is gone, MAGA as we know it collapses. It might rebrand or morph into something else, but the current iteration will die without its central figure.

Change my view. I’m open to arguments that someone else could credibly take up the mantle, or that the ideology is strong enough on its own to outlive him. But to me, it feels like this movement lives and dies with Donald Trump.",superdino1234,1199,0.8500000238418579,303,1744737271,2025-04-15 12:14:31,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jzxel2/cmv_maga_and_the_new_conservative_movement_that/,4,2025

1k5upf0,"CMV: Trump's tarrif war isn't stupidity or incompetence, he wants to tank the dollar.","1) Doge extracts 2+ trillion from the fed as a tax break for the rich. Meanwhile Trump and his inner circle are using his tarrif war to pump the economy for bill/trillion more (it's hard to know how much but they all start investing with 10-100s billions so they can get to trill faster than any of us). They're amassing capital. 
2)Trump said on day one he wanted to declare martial law, and signed EOs to get that ball rolling (something about immigrants). He cut USAID, farmers started posting videos about losing their farms because it was subsidizing many of them. He assaults immigrants,  farmers started  posting videos about not being able to run their farms. He enacted tarrifs and farmers posted videos about not being able to supply their farms. Farmers are losing their farms, that sounds like a food shortage this winter.  And that's just the kind of ""emergency "" Trump needs to declare that sweet, sweet  martial law. So he'll let it happen, who cares if the left calls him stupid for not seeing it coming.
3) They've been warning us for decades the dollar would fail, and in recent years sooner rather than later. Trump has antagonized Canada and Greenland with annexation, rewrote who was the aggressor in Ukraine and described the EU as designed to screw the US. No one trusts us. Noone wants to invest in us or buy our debt and they're starting to worry about using our currency, the default currency (or whatever it's called). Combine that with food shortages and unrest at home and that sounds to me like a recipe for how the dollar, already  struggling, finally fails.
4) At this point, with no currency, the US would  be bankrupt.  Banks get involved, you know, the banking system everyone loves and trusts and always have.  Can you think of anyone ( see point 1) who might, recently, have acquired the capital nessassary to pay the banks? Should an entity (maybe a real estate mogul) purchase the property south of Canada and north of Mexico it would become theirs. They wouldn't be any more beholden to the constitution than someone buying an abandoned factory is to the business that originally built it.  Trump, who operates his businesses this way, would then be free to reconstitute it as his personal corporate dictatorship (he said term 1 day 1 he wanted to be a dictator and has said he'd prefer to run the country like a business).  And while international law may have something to say about our fate, does Trump seem like someone who thinks he's answerable to the international community?

----I'm gonna wander a bit off topic here, this next bit is just for ""the lefties"". The above bit, though. I genuinely want you to change my view.----


If Trump (& the Heritage Foundation) is the wannabe tyrant it seems like he wants to be.
A) A ""food shortage"" is an effective way to hold an entire population down. I'd expect it to continue. Also, power and communications black outs, ""due to the food riots "". A good excuse to send troops after his enemies? Maybe relocate people to places ""he can supply food and power to"" (the US has done it before)? While he's saving us. I'd figure communications would return quickly enough, but only things propaganda compatible would be allowed. (I'm thinking about how they say TV is in China, N Korea, etc)

B) The mid terms will be too late. What few patriots are left in government need to know  if they move to incarcerate Trump and the heritage foundation loyalist we will be there in large enough number to prevent another Jan 6. They can't act if we aren't there to protect them and prove, once and for all, that trump's will isn't the will of the patriotic United States of America! 

Time is running out. We all have to come out. This isn't politics as usual. This year we may well decide if self governance was too hard. If we fundamentally believe in freedom, liberty and happiness for all, or if we feel like the great American experiment was a failure. It wasn't. call every elected and appointed official you can as offen as you can and TELL THEM! Show up at every protest you can. Go to your town halls. Ask the 60's, it works!

For any ""righties"" who made it this far, if you believe in the constitutional USA (and I think, deep down, even the angriest of you do), I hope you guys understand everyone over here is just worried the same corporations that corrupted our (our) system of government are finally making their move.  It's not really about Trump specifically,  we just think he's in on it. We may disagree about things, but in this system we each get to celebrate our sides victories or plan to win the other side over next time. The greatest victory is converting your opponent. And for the petty among us all, you get to poke at the other side like an a.. and no one  can really stop you.( But if you start it they can preach back at you, fairs fair, ;) )  

Listen,  if we're wrong we'll eat crow( I'll get seconds for this) and we'll all have a laugh about how worked up social media got us. If we're right we're all going to suffer.

1jszk88,CMV: Gen Z has more in common with Boomers than Millennials.,"There’s obviously a difference in values, but in terms of attitude, behavior, and general vibe, Gen Z actually shares more with Boomers than they do with Millennials. Why? Well…

	1.	They’re kind of isolationist.

Gen Z seems more withdrawn. They value alone time and don’t love socializing outside their comfort zone. Which means…

	2.	Neither are great at emotional communication in person.

Gen Z often struggles to express feelings face-to-face. They shut down or avoid important conversations entirely. Kinda Boomer-ish, right? Different reasons, similar result. This creates…

	3.	Rigid belief systems.

Gen Z tends to adopt strong, black-and-white views—much like Boomers clinging to fixed worldviews. There’s less room for nuance or gray areas. Which is why…

	4.	Both love secondhand outrage.

There’s a shared grumpiness. Gen Z gets fired up over stuff that doesn’t affect them directly. Boomers did the same - just with a different set of values. Which brings me to…

	5.	Societal rule enforcement.

Gen Z is big on calling people out for breaking unspoken social rules. Boomers loved rules too - just old-school ones. And this really shows up on social media, because guess what, both are…

	6.	Chronically online

Boomers are Facebook addicts, Gen Z are TikTok addicts. Different platforms, same result: constant outrage and a worldview shaped by the algorithm. But the pièce de résistance…

	7.	Both think Millennials are cringey.

Boomers and Gen Z hate looking stupid. Millennials didn’t have that luxury - they grew up online, testing boundaries to figure out what was “too far.” Gen Z is way more self-aware and peer-policed, so they play it safe. Boomers just call this “dignity.”

I’m obviously not saying all Gen Z or Boomers as individuals are the same. But taking the tropes, clichés, and general vibe you get from each generation… if you strip away the aesthetics and politics, Gen Z sometimes feels like Boomer 2.0. Just younger, sassier and with better skincare routines.

1kazuo6,CMV: The liberal focus on nonviolent protests betrays the fact that most of the successful nonviolent movements existed alongside the implicit or explicit threat of violence,"Note to the admins: This is absolutely not a call to violence. Just an observation.

Anybody who has been to a protest in the US knows that the organizers take great efforts to ensure protests remain nonviolent. There are usually speeches, shouting, marching, etc. I've never been to an organized protest where the organizers did not take great care that we remained civil. The thing is, online and in liberal community projects, there's always the idea of nonviolent resistance held up as a golden standard by which we all abide.

My point of view comes from a few observations:

The first is that our protests lately seem to not be working. There's a rising tide of fascism in the US marked by the erosion of the institutions of democracy, threats to the judiciary, the politicization of civil service, and threats to the free press. Despite the protesting, we've had near-zero effect on public policy.

The second is that historical ""non-violent"" movements were always accompanied by implicit or explicit threat of violence. The US Civil Rights movement was widely known to be non-violent, however it existed alongside more violent groups like the Black Panthers and others. These protests gained moral authority and effectiveness partly because they existed alongside more militant alternatives that made peaceful change seem like the preferable option to those in power.

Other examples would include:

* Suffrage, with women in the movement who murdered opposition, did arson and property damage, and set off bombs
* The US Labor Movement in the early 1900s, where unions would destroy factories and kill the owners on occasion, to gain rights
* The Stonewall Uprising, where trans women threw bricks at police and shifted the movement from primarily accommodationist tactics to more assertive demands for rights
* In South Africa, after the Sharpeville massacre of 1960, the African National Congress formed an armed wing (Umkhonto we Sizwe) while continuing other forms of resistance. Nelson Mandela later acknowledged that this multi-faceted approach was strategically necessary given the context.

Basically I'm saying that nonviolence has historically not always been the answer. I think liberals tend to whitewash the truth to make it more acceptable to the average person, rather than discuss the true history behind some of these movements. I think they've sort of blindly accepted nonviolence as the only solution to an authoritarian uprising in the US and it's not getting them anywhere.

1juj69e,CMV: They did NOT bring dire wolves back from extinction,"For those unfamiliar, there is a huge story right now about this biotech company that supposedly brought dire wolves back from extinction. They are claiming this to be the first ever ""de-extinct"" species

What they actually did was genetically modify a grey wolf. They used machine learning and AI to compare the DNA of a dire wolf to the DNA of a grey wolf, and then they genetically modified grey wolf DNA to make it more similar to a dire wolf. Apparently they made 20 edits to 14 genes to make this happen. 

First of all, I do think it's interesting and cool what they did, very impressive stuff. I've seen people dismissing this and acting like they did some random guesswork to what a dire wolf would have looked like and they then modified a grey wolf to look like what they think dire wolves looked like. Essentially glorified dog breeding. I'm not going that far, from my understanding they used a tooth and a bone from two different dire wolf fossils to actually understand the difference between dire wolf DNA and grey wolf DNA. In theory, if you edited the DNA of a chimpanzee (which is 99% similar to a human) to match the DNA of a human, then you could make a human being even if the source of DNA is technically that of a chimpanzee. Similarly, you could do the same with grey wolves and dire wolves. 

So maybe some day this company will get much more advanced and actually be able to genetically engineer extinct species in a way that actually makes them effectively the same species as an extinct species that died out thousands of years ago. But in the case of this dire wolf...yeah that ain't a dire wolf. Editing 14 genes of a grey wolf in my layman opinion is not enough to say that this isn't still just a grey wolf. I could be wrong about that so to any biologists reading this, please correct me if I'm wrong. But I would view this more to what a Yorkie is to a Doberman. They look different, but both are still dogs. 

I would guess that these supposedly de-extinct dire wolves might look similar to what dire wolves looked like (although we don't know exactly what they looked like), but I highly doubt it has the same behavior and thought processes. Like imagine if you genetically modified a gorilla to look like a human, but it still behaved and thought like a gorilla. Would that really be a human? 

**BONUS**

This is separate from the main CMV, but I would also add that this company is claiming to be doing this for the sake of biodiversity and bringing extinct species back into the ecosystem for the sake of fulfilling a specific role. I doubt that's actually the intention of this company. I bet this will more likely lead to ""extinct animal"" zoos (basically Jurassic Park), and probably in the long run the ability to genetically engineer humans.

Democracy includes taking into account everyone's opinions and experiences. If only the wealthy and successful could cast ballots, democracy would be faulty. It would put lower-class groups in a worse situation and result in lower status and income. The voters who have already achieved success to achieve become better at the expense of those less fortunate. Since everyone usually votes for their interests and ideals. If voting to support two others worsened their predicament, no one would do it. We should still acknowledge the ideals of the less fortunate, even if they are problematic to society as a whole.",Arkziri,774,0.8700000047683716,296,1744582475,2025-04-13 17:14:35,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jyjjzh/cmv_saying_less_successful_people_should_have/,4,2025
1jvk879,CMV: The MAGA movement’s normalization of misinformation and distrust in facts is a growing threat to our future.,"I believe the consistent spread of misinformation within MAGA circles—and the refusal by many supporters to engage with credible sources—has become more than just a political divide. It’s setting a precedent where truth is subjective, and that’s incredibly dangerous.

What worries me most is that this trend isn’t stabilizing—it’s accelerating. People are not only doubling down on false claims after they’ve been thoroughly debunked, but they’re also building entire communities around those false beliefs. From election denial to anti-vaccine rhetoric, there’s a growing culture of mistrust that turns facts into “opinions” and disagreement into personal attacks.

This isn’t just frustrating—it’s a problem that’s compounding over time. Children are being raised in environments where critical thinking is discouraged and mainstream sources of information are dismissed out of hand. Social media bubbles reinforce these views, and alternative “news” ecosystems amplify them without accountability. We’re not just dealing with misinformed individuals—we’re watching the formation of a parallel reality, complete with its own heroes, villains, and narratives.

I recognize that misinformation exists across the political spectrum. But from what I’ve seen, the normalization and reinforcement of false narratives within the MAGA movement feels uniquely intense, widespread, and socially accepted in their circles.",seekinganswerslo,752,0.8399999737739563,385,1744242117,2025-04-09 18:41:57,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jvk879/cmv_the_maga_movements_normalization_of/,4,2025
1jw9i2a,CMV: MAGA Republicans Get Triggered Just Much as Liberals Do,"Everyone loves saying "" Oh the left always gets triggered, facts over feelings"" etc. But in my opinion we live in a society where everyone gets triggered. Honestly MAGA republicans get triggered just as much as liberals do and don't get as much flak for it. I'll give two really great examples to prove my point. 

  
1. I recently saw an IG reel of a woman wearing a MAGA hat who walked into a gay bar where the bartenders were clearly trans. The second she walked in the bartender's told her to leave she was clearly upset by this and asked ""Why you don't want my money"" The bartenders said ""No it's because you're a Trump supporter"" this is something that very much upset her but they weren't having any of it. They said if she didn't leave that they'd call the police. Then the woman said that was discrimination LOL. First off, that's not discrimination because your political affiliation isn't a protected class, so let's just get that out of the way. But something this women didn't realize is that she literally voted for someone that's trying to take the rights away from these people and then she wants to get mad when these same people don't wanna welcome them to their establishment and act hostile towards them lol. The bartenders behavior was completely justifiable towards her.

  
2. I saw a clip of Sam Seder ( A liberal commentator) on Patrick Bet David's podcast ( A known Trump supporter). PBD is honestly one of those pseudo intellectuals, it's crazy to me that people actually see him as a trusted news source considering how much misinformation he spreads. Anyways Sam Seder says exactly this on how PBD and his team spread misinformation on how illegal immigrants were getting social security benefits ( Not true btw legal, permanent resident green card holder's can get social security benefits, and can get a social security number. This is something that any green card holder can get) Anyways, Sam Seder says exactly that to PBD and his team, and they did what they always do whenever they get called out for spreading lies. They all just interrupted, spoke over, dismissed, and deflected everything Sam Seder said so much to the point that he really couldn't speak lol. It was pretty embarrassing to see these grown men have basically a toddler like melt down when they got called out for something wrong and couldn't even admit it. If this was any liberal doing the same thing these same people would clown them and be like "" Oh these liberals get so triggered""

1jvw9br,CMV: If Trump engaged in insider trading that’s bad.,"Trump’s recent decisions to apply massive tariffs and then suddenly remove the tariffs caused huge swings in the stock market. Anyone with knowledge of the trade policies before they were enacted could make wild sums of money by buying stock market positions that predict how the market will react to the new policy. If Trump or his staff participated in insider trading, it would be corrupt and unethical.

The president of the United States holds one of the most powerful and influential positions in the world. With access to vast amounts of sensitive information and the ability to influence financial markets through policy decisions, the president is expected to uphold the highest ethical standards. If the president were to engage in insider trading—the practice of trading stocks or other securities based on non-public, material information you are entrusted not to use to your personal benefit—it would have severe consequences for the country’s integrity, economy, and public trust in government.

First and foremost, insider trading by the president would represent a gross abuse of power. The office of the president is entrusted with confidential information that, if used improperly, could unfairly benefit individuals or groups financially. Using that information for personal gain would be a betrayal of public trust and a violation of the duty to serve the nation’s interests above one’s own. The president is supposed to be a role model for lawful and ethical behavior. If the highest leader in the country engages in illegal financial activity, it sets a dangerous precedent for others in government and beyond.

Moreover, insider trading undermines the fairness and stability of financial markets. The stock market functions best when all participants have equal access to information. When someone, especially someone as powerful as the president, uses confidential knowledge to make financial decisions, it creates an uneven playing field. This can erode investor confidence and deter people from participating in the market, ultimately harming the economy.

Another major concern is the potential for corruption and manipulation. If a president benefits from insider trading, there may be a temptation to shape policies not based on the public good, but on what would increase personal wealth. For instance, the president could delay or push legislation in a way that benefits certain companies or industries they have investments in. This would erode democratic principles and lead to governance driven by profit, not the public’s welfare.

Finally, insider trading by the president would deal a serious blow to public trust in government institutions. Citizens expect transparency, accountability, and fairness from their leaders. If the president is seen as using their position for personal enrichment, it fosters cynicism, apathy, and resentment among the public. This can weaken civic engagement and faith in the democratic process.

Below are a few arguments I’d guess people may make against my claim. I’d be curious if there’s evidence for any of these or any other explanation for believing that it would be okay for Trump to engage in insider trading.

-Insider trading does not hurt anyone.

-If Trump can increase his wealth and power, that is good for the country even if some people lose out.",Guilty_Scar_730,740,0.8399999737739563,337,1744286748,2025-04-10 07:05:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jvw9br/cmv_if_trump_engaged_in_insider_trading_thats_bad/,4,2025
1k2xt24,CMV: The Trump tariffs are intended to distract from the fact that the most sensible and effective way to reduce the U.S. national debt is to tax the rich,"The U.S. national debt is primarily influenced by the difference between government spending and tax revenue. Tax cuts generally increase the deficit. In fact, some studies show tax cuts by the Bush and Trump administration “have added $10 trillion to the debt since their enactment and are responsible for 57 percent of the increase in the debt ratio since 2001, and more than 90 percent of the increase in the debt ratio if the one-time costs of bills responding to COVID-19 and the Great Recession are excluded.” ([americanprogress.org](http://americanprogress.org))


I believe Trump is aware of the effect tax cuts have on the national debt. I believe he is firing federal workers and instituting tariffs as a scapegoat. He pretends those things will reduce the federal deficit; however, he knows they’re not a particularly effective way of doing so. It’s just that he prefers those things to taxing the rich.


The U.S. national debt sits at roughly $36 trillion. The top 1% of Americans are worth roughly $45 trillion. It stands to reason that raising taxes—especially as it relates to the top 1%—would be an effective way of reducing the federal deficit. Relative to instituting tariffs and firing federal workers, taxing the rich would likely raise more money and lead to lesser consequences for more American people. I believe Trump is aware of much of this, however, unlike most American people, Trump fears taxing the rich would more negatively affect him than tariffs and firing federal workers.

1k424qz,CMV: Republicans don't really care about religion/family values or being anti-crime if they support Trump,"Trump is a convicted felon and was accused of rape/sexual harrassment by multiple women. He's been divorced multiple times and has cheated with many women (including an adult actress after his wife just gave birth). He lies constantly and is just generally rude to people. He's really greedy and narcissistic. He basically goes against everything in the Bible and what Jesus stood for. As a result, I don't think it makes sense for someone to care about religion/family values or being anti-crime (like many Republicans claim to be) and also support Trump at the same time.",Blonde_Icon,714,0.7699999809265137,390,1745199921,2025-04-20 20:45:21,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k424qz/cmv_republicans_dont_really_care_about/,4,2025
1jr133l,"CMV: Donald Trump has no functional understanding of the policies he implements, aside from those pertaining to sociocultural issues.","The only time he speaks with any conviction is when he is railing against DEI, wokeness, the radical left, etc. I believe his bigoted views on those subjects are really his own. Otherwise, he just mindlessly reads words off a teleprompter, occasionally throwing in a useless anecdote that makes it sound like he was involved in crafting the policy he's talking about. He sounds like he wants to be doing *anything other than giving this speech.* When he has to answer questions, he always shoves in a barely relevant factoid that he clearly just learned, unaware that he is the only one in the room who did not already know it. He understands enough to know that his [fiscal/healthcare/defense/infrastructure/foreign] policy is the one that conservatives like and liberals dislike, but he has no personal beliefs about why these policies are supposedly good - nor does he care to develop any. It's a chore to him.",laketunnel1,673,0.8299999833106995,156,1743733226,2025-04-03 21:20:26,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jr133l/cmv_donald_trump_has_no_functional_understanding/,4,2025
