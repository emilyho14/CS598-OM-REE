Reddit Submission: [Wearing hearing aids could help cut the risk of dementia, according to a large decade-long study. The research accounted for other factors, including loneliness, social isolation and depression, but found that untreated hearing loss still had a strong association with dementia](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/12ls0pi/wearing_hearing_aids_could_help_cut_the_risk_of/)

The article [""Association between hearing aid use and all-cause and cause-specific dementia: an analysis of the UK Biobank cohort""](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(23)00048-8) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00314-0) from *The Lancet Public Health* as of December 12, 2023. The accompanying [editorial](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(23)00083-X) and [commentary](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(23)00058-0) articles have also been retracted. As [reported by Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/2024/01/04/we-should-have-followed-up-lancet-journal-retracts-article-on-hearing-aids-and-dementia-after-prodding/), concerns were raised by Jure Mur, a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh, after he was unable to replicate the paper's results while attempting a related analysis.

After being stonewalled by the authors and months of back-and-forth correspondence with the journal, Mur, *et al.*, submitted [a comment article](https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2_comment_article.docx.pdf) formally documenting their concerns. The journal solicited the [authors' response](https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3.1_author_response.pdf), but declined to publish either document. In their response, the authors noted they had ""found some discrepancies between coding schemes"" and described a new analysis of the data. These new results aligned with the findings of Mur, *et al.*, contradicting the original published paper. However, the authors did not request a retraction or major correction as part of their response. Several weeks later, after continued pressure from Mur, [the journal announced](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00314-0) the authors had requested a retraction after after discovering ""errors in their analysis which render their findings and conclusions false and misleading.""

A spokesperson for *The Lancet* issued the following statement to Retraction Watch:

>While acknowledging ""some discrepancies between coding systems"", they argued that ""The overall message of the study did not change."" In good faith, we accepted the authors' explanation, and decided not to publish the exchange. In retrospect, we should have followed up the admitted discrepancies more assiduously and worked with the authors and Dr Mur to settle any outstanding uncertainties. Dr Mur rightly challenged our decision in an email on November 16. We immediately recognised the seriousness of his concerns and wrote again to the authors on November 22 asking them to further clarify their analyses, based on Dr Mur's evidence and our own by now heightened unease. On November 24, the authors reported major errors in their paper, which rendered their findings and conclusions false and misleading. We moved quickly to retract the paper on December 12, 2023.
