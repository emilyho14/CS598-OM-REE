1bz23lw,CMV: A minor lying about their age on a dating app is NOT a victim.,"I need to explain fully what I mean. Let’s say you’re on a dating app, take Grindr for example. Then you start talking with a person who says they’re 18 and looks 18, and you start sexting. Let’s then say it turns out the person you’re talking to actually is 16. Who is in the wrong then? I don’t understand this. Cause to me it’s so obvious who’s in the wrong, the 16 year old… They lied about their damn age, so how could you be the one in the wrong then? But, apparently you could be the one facing charges then? Right? How… That’s literally so messed up. But it feels like society would view the 16 year old as the victim, or am I wrong??

1c4wp1m,CMV: Dating apps massively contributed to the rise of manosphere/incel ideology,"I've been reading a lot of posts from those subscribed to manosphere stuff here, and I've come to realise that a huge part of why this is happening is the use of dating apps to get dates. The apps basically force everyone to judge a person by a few pictures and a short prompt and give the impression that how you look is all that matters in a relationship, when often people fall in love after knowing and talking to someone. Given that men outnumber women on these apps, it's not surprising that men would find themselves in a highly competitive environment when in reality it's much closer to 50/50. This imbalance left a lot of younger men disappointed at themselves and, worse yet, women for not getting dates. I have this sense that dating apps market themselves as a way to find love, but for a lot of men it's just something that they find upsetting and disappointing. And when someone doesn't have the right support and structure, they would find the manosphere ideology appealing because it feels like their failures have been answered, even though obviously the ideology falls apart at the smallest scrutiny.

I'm sure some people will attribute this to patriarchy, but this manner of demeaning women hasn't been mainstreamed for many many decades, and patriarchy certainly wasn't any weaker back then, so in my view the best explanation is the perception that dating apps is the only way to get dates.",WheatBerryPie,1646,0.8899999856948853,498,1713213042,2024-04-15 15:30:42,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c4wp1m/cmv_dating_apps_massively_contributed_to_the_rise/,4,2024

1ch2b60,CMV: Religious people are excessively accomodated,"I believe that the fact that these accommodations must be recognized often amounts to discrimination against those who are not religious as it implies religious beliefs to be more important than non-religious beliefs. To give an example in parts of Canada and in the UK Sikhs are permitted to ride a motorcycle without a helmet despite it being illegal for anyone else to do the same.  By doing this the government has implied that Sikhism is a more virtuous belief than any other than could involve one choosing not to wear a helmet. Another non Sikh could choose not to wear a helmet simply because they believe that 'looking cooler' on the bike is worth the health risk of not wearing a helmet and by not allowing this the government is implying that the Sikh principles are superior to the principals of maximizing how cool one looks. It is also unfair that taxpayers in the countries will be forced to pay the excessive healthcare bills stemming from the more severe injuries caused by the lack of helmet. A more reasonable solution would be that anyone who chooses not to wear a helmet must pay an extra annual fee to cover the added healthcare costs.

&#x200B;

Another better example would be the fact that Kirpans (knives) are allowed to be carried onto airplanes by Sikhs but not by anyone else in Canada. The religious reason for wearing a Kirpan is in part self defense yet if any other Canadian chooses to carry a knife for self defense reasons it is a violation of the law and they would rightly be denied permission to bring one onto an airplane. Therefore self defence as a principle is honored by the government when it is packaged as part of a religion but not when it is just an important belief held by an individual. The Supreme Court of Canada even went so far as to say this about a kid bringing a kirpan to school

>Religious tolerance is a very important value of Canadian society.  If some students consider it unfair that G may wear his kirpan to school while they are not allowed to have knives in their possession, it is incumbent on the schools to discharge their obligation to instil in their students this value that is at the very foundation of our democracy.

this is a perfect demonstration of the mindset I described. As a non-religious person none of your personal beliefs are required to be taken with the same level of seriousness as a religion's beliefs. I fail to see why this mindset should be held as it is not a fact that religion is some kind of objectively good thing.

1bu11sl,CMV: I believe society let female harasser and predators get away with things lightly just because people find it hard attributing such behavior to women,"
I work as a male stripper , and I encounter a lot of evil, manipulative and predatory women in my line of work. They are more common in the rich and “high profile” parties/clients . 

And I find it odd how no one talks about it. And how it’s low key rewarded by society.


When I first started modeling and dancing, I was good at my job where I ended up being invited to more high profile parties to just perform. I was in my early 20s. Perform to rich , famous people sometimes even.

And my first encounter with sexual harassment was in one of these parties by one of these rich/popular women.

I froze and let it happen. 

But then when I told my manager and colleagues , I was always told to “man up” or “you should feel lucky” or “many guys would pay to be in that position” and so on.

I guess it didn’t help that these clients held a lot of power in terms of money and influence that the managers would side with them and just train us to let it happen and enjoy and shut up about it . 

Being a nobody who was young , being paid good and peer pressured into it being a good thing . You get used to it. 

Because to society , when a woman is the predator , it’s seen as hot.

And it’s not even about me being a man , it happens to female dancers as well , and the response is very different when its a woman taking advantage of her power compared to men. 


I just find it odd . Maybe I’m wrong but I just felt like sharing my point of view

1c8rxy4,CMV: Polyamory is just a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal.,"Three years ago, my ex partner unilaterally demanded we open our marriage during a trip with friends where I couldn't escape or even have a healthy conversation about it, then threatened to leave if I didn't comply when we came home.   
  
I begged and pleaded, but eventually relented. Then, after a few months I began to explore the literature and rules of polyamory in online support groups and became curious about finding my own relationships outside of our marriage (I realised later that this was mostly to escape the abuse I was still putting up with at home, which had persisted for for years).   
  
When I told my partner that I was also curious to find other people, she exploded in a terrifying rage that I am still struggling to understand. She accused me of just taking advantage of her 'coming out polyamorous first' in our marriage, insisted that I couldn't possibly be polyamorous because I am autistic, and finally demanded I 'prove' to her (somehow) that I ever felt love for another person other than her. 

When I couldn't come up with an example other than the one other crush I had before we began officially dating six years prior, she again threatened to leave, screaming at me for being a misogynist, and all I could do was beg for forgiveness and cry myself to sleep. 

She apologised days later, but halfheartedly and still accused me of being both a misogynist and narcissist who needed therapy and we scheduled couple's therapy together with a poly-friendly therapist. 

Two months later--and four days before our appointment--she cheated on me. 

She came home and confessed while begging for forgiveness in another whirlwind of pain, and again I gave her a pass as I was now terrified of being abandoned--only for her to buy a one-way ticket to Portland the next morning. 

I never saw her again. 

She filed for divorce 1,000 miles away, leaving me with our two cats and a whole heap of debt. I still went to our therapist appointment somehow, but alone. She was incredible. She helped me understand the full extent of the abuse I had been suffering for years and convinced me that polyamory and narcissism often intersect--but don't necessarily have to. 

But it still didn't help, and I checked myself into an emergency outpatient facility after a suicide attempt.

Things stabilised, but I left the country and am now struggling with severe mental illness and barely making ends meet while having to deal with the constant aching pain of having lost my best friend to what still feels like a relationship system defined by 'what you can get out of life'--not on forming a unique, stable, honest, and committed partnership. 

Please help me change my view.

I'm left grappling with deep emotional scars, questioning whether polyamory is inherently flawed or if my experience was an outlier.

I acknowledge that my ex-partner's behaviour was manipulative and abusive, but I'm struggling to reconcile how polyamory could be anything other than a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal. However, I'm open to reconsidering my perspective, as I don't want to let one traumatic experience colour my understanding of an entire relationship dynamic.

I'm seeking insights from the community to challenge my current view. Can anyone provide examples or arguments that showcase healthy and fulfilling polyamorous relationships? How can I separate my ex-partner's toxic behaviour from the broader concept of polyamory? I want to believe that love and honesty can coexist within non-monogamous relationships, but I need help reconciling my pain and trauma.",Ronald-Obvious,1002,0.7900000214576721,357,1713625010,2024-04-20 09:56:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8rxy4/cmv_polyamory_is_just_a_breeding_ground_for/,4,2024
1c0vth7,CMV: Eating a dog is not ethicallly any different than eating a pig,"To the best of my understanding, both are highly intelligent, social, emotional animals. Equally capable of suffering, and pain.

Yet, dog consumption in some parts of the world is very much looked down upon as if it is somehow an unspeakably evil practice. Is there any actual argument that can be made for this differential treatment - apart from just a sentimental attachment to dogs due to their popularity as a pet?

I can extend this argument a bit further too. As far as I am concerned, killing any animal is as bad as another. There are certain obvious exceptions: 

1. Humans don't count in this list of ""animals"". I may not be able to currently make a completely coherent argument for why this distinction is so obviously justifiable (to me), but perhaps that is irrelevant for this CMV. 
2. Animals that actively harm people (mosquitoes, for example) are more justifiably killed. 

Apart from these edge cases, why should the murder/consumption of any animal (pig, chicken, cow, goat, rats)  be viewed as more ok than some others (dogs, cats, etc)?

1cbrfoe,"CMV: American Jews on the Left are expected to tolerate a level of blatant antisemitism from POC, both personally and more broadly, that would be inconceivable if roles were reversed. ","The blunt truth about it is, American Jews are more concerned with appearing racist then black or Latino Americans are with being antisemitic. Or, if they do think it’s antisemitic they think it takes a backseat to their own struggles against discrimination. Because — most of them — are white. If they think about it at all. It may be no less conscious then something you grow up around hearing. 

This isn’t to say that there isn’t *lots* of work to do in the “white” community still when it comes to race relations *and* antisemitism or that this discrimination cancels out the other, it’s just to say that this is a real problem in the black community. While they were never ever representative of a majority of black Americans, the Nation of Islam was and continues to be an influential part of African America life, especially in cities. 

And if you agree protocols of the elders of Zion is antisemitic book, then you’d agree that an organization that takes its cues on the topic of Jews from such a antisemitic book would likely be, by extension antisemitic. Well early NOI was very much such an organization. And if that organization had deep roots in certain segments of black America it would probably be somewhat worthwhile to consider its effects.  

All this to say, there’s a reason Kanye West — who coincidentally also defended Louis Farrakhan from correct accusations of antisemitism — is still embraced by hip-hop fans and rappers today and if anything seems to be making a comeback of sorts.

Not that me saying this really matters. The people whose opinion this would change don’t read this and they’d only listen to people they respect within their local community. But it does look, to the outside viewer at least, that there’s a lack of reciprocity. 

During the George Floyd protests the arguments for taking to the streets to demand justice and reform society o prevent antiblack racism from killing more Americans or destroying more lives, were rooted in appeals to fundamental appeals to human rights to God. You can’t use that as a cudgel to motivate and shame people into action then turn around and ignore it or say “why they gotta drag black people into it”. Especially when it’s your fellow countrymen.

1bz9dgm,CMV: The Quran’s injunction against interfaith marriage for Muslim women faith while allowing Muslim men to marry whoever they want is a blatant example of men writing the rules for religion,"There’s no logical reason for it  except the same possessive need to control “their” women’s sexualities and reproductive organs that characterized much of Eurasian gender relations. At various points in history Muslim men have married Christian, Jewish, Confucian and even Hindu women. And were never seen as “less” Muslim for having done it. 

Not so for Muslim women. 

Miss me with the “the religion is inherited from the mother” boloney, there’s no quantifiable, genetic “muslimness” that’s passed down from mother to child. Men and women give the same amount of chromosomes to their kids and the same amount of religion too, which is none. 

There’s no reason a Muslim woman and a Christian man, who worked it out with each other prior to marriage, acknowledged that the children they’d have will be taught the values and tenets of Islam. That way the faith is preserved in the family if that’s so important to her.

Everyone is absolutely suffering now in some way or another except for those who live in a comfort that came from taking advantage of someone else.

1bvtplk,CMV: Anyone who sacrifices 40 hours a week of their life deserves to make a living wage,"I will define a living wage as enough money to cover food, housing, internet, phone, electricity, and necessary travel to and from work. Pretty basic, and far from lavish. 

40 hours a week is 24% of one's life. That amount of time should be valued enough by society to grant someone dignity and the ability to cover their basic needs. 

Looking at minimum wage jobs, a worker at McDonald's works harder than many high earning professions, doing a job not many others are willing to do, to provide a service that society would miss if no one was willing to work it. Even low skill jobs, apply stress, exhaustion, and sacrifice of time out of their lives. 

I would also argue that many minimum wage jobs are more important to daily functions of the public, than a lot of cushiony mid to higher level experience jobs, otherwise these jobs wouldn't exist.

People often use the example that a teenager in school doesn't need to make a living wage, however if they are working full time, perhaps they do. Regardless, their effort and the time committed to working said job should warrant the same pay, if they put in the same hours.

1c40sa9,"CMV: I struggle to understand why the crisis of masculinity is even a thing, why so many young men listen to the manosphere or influencers in general, etc. I think it is a case of crisis of independence rather than crisis of masculinity.","The current conversation about masculinity (in the US) confuses me very much, and I say this as a man. I grew up in a fairly stable middle class household, parents divorced in my early teens. I joined the US military at 18, served for a few years, and travelled around the country. After my service I started college and am soon entering my senior year. Why am I telling you all this?

I've always considered myself a highly independent person. I've also figured out a lot of things in my life on my own, to include how to rent an apartment, saving for retirement and amassing decent wealth for my age, entering and being successful in school, having a fair number of romantic partners. By many metrics of modern masculinity, I've done well for myself. But this also leaves me confused as to what men are missing from their lives or what they're having a crisis over.

I've never felt the need to have someone validate my masculinity (as it seems that needing someone else for that kinda defeats the point). Truth be told, ""being masculine"" has never really mattered to me much because its always seemed to be buying in to what someone else thinks is a necessary way to live your life--which returns me to my independence point. The rise of influencers and the manosphere has also seemed to be a weird proxy for mentors in many men's lives, which has always seemed to be a case of being far too online for too long in my opinion. I've also never really leaned on many mentors in my life, but that is probably by own bias showing, I'm sure many people get a lot of guidance out of mentor figures.

This altogether is to say that it seems that this crisis of masculinity is at its core a crisis of independence and men unable or unwilling to figure out their lives for themselves. Perhaps it was the military that ultimately gave me this independent foundation, but I think that proves my point--that it is independence and what it gives you than anything that masculinity is doing for people. The point is not that masculinity is failing or unstable, but that men are unable to be independent and take charge of their independence for themselves. Why, I'm not sure exactly--rent is high and wages are low, but women seemingly aren't having as much of a crisis about themselves these days. Many seem to be enjoying and embracing independence instead.

It’s not only on reddit. Take instagram, X, facebook and tiktok as well. 


I’m left rather confused regarding what these men precisely mean by low body count. Back in my home country, the consensus is that a woman should be virgin before marriage.

I understand groceries are a necessity (and that should be sufficient motivation for lawmakers to address the issues with crime instead of hand waving people's complaints aside.) but it's also completely understandable that grocers don't want to stay in high crime areas and they can't be forced to. It is San Francisco Lawmakers' responsibility to maintain communities that businesses will want to be a part of and if they are unable to do so then I think that should be grounds for removal.

The video gets viral and they become ig famous because of young teenagers, which is the main audience of these barbers. And these barbers start charging (scamming) 80-100+ dollars for a haircut. They usually get these cuts done under 45 mins as well. As a result, the ego of these barbers is massively inflated too. This ego boost has somehow spread to the average barber and they have started charging 50+ dollars for average cuts at best. So a reasonable adult has no choice but to at least spend 50+ dollars on a simple haircut. Other option is cutting your own hair which is not very viable for many.

1c5lpos,"CMV: Saying ""I hate all men"" doesn't make sense","Firstly, to be clear, I understand that I may be in the wrong for this one.

A couple months ago I was hanging out with a bunch of friends (mostly women, two men, not including me) and one suddenly started talking about how she ""hated all men"" and went on about how much she hated all men and how all men should be killed.

While I understand that there are a lot of bad or evil men, and a lot of/all the men she had interacted with might be part of that group, but that can't mean everyone is.

I then said, confused, ""isn't that too much of a generalization?"" and ""there's gotta be, you know, an adjective before 'men' right?""

She didn't answer then, but one of the other girls sent me a message after, saying that the girl was furious about what I said.

Another thing is when I said, at a later time, that ""for example, what if I were to say: Women are bad drivers and get into car crashes all the time, therefore I hate all women"" (not that I believe that, of course)

She then replied ""It's not the same thing"" which also confuses me.

For short: I think it's ok to hate a group of (in this case) men, but grouping everyone with the people that rob, attack or rape people and therefore saying that you hate them doesn't make sense to me.

X instead asked Y about her thoughts on abortion. Y rejected that topic and said it was private. X pressed the issue, but Y refused to participate, saying she was uncomfortable to reveal her stance

X became upset, saying that a refusal to reveal her stance on such a polarizing topic was itself a political statement, and to be neutral is to stand with the oppressors (I am paraphrasing)

1c6swqd,CMV: The Tipping Culture In The US Has Gotten Ridiculous ,"I am going to get a lot of hate for this one but I’m already prepared lol. 

Tipping Culture in the US specifically has gotten way out of hand I mean it’s ridiculous at this point. I am not some stingy individual and I have no problem with giving people tips for their service and time. But nowadays there seems to be a weird vibe that you have to always tip, and if you don’t you are a scumbag or something. 

I grew up learning and understanding the value of tipping for GOOD service, not shitty service. If I go to a car wash and after my car still has visible stains and missed spots, I should not be forced to provide a tip for that service. 

And I know what you are thinking right now no one is forcing me to give anyone a tip. The issue is looks of shame and disgust that people in the service industry will give you, as well as the overall peer pressure of how others perceie you. 

And let’s not get started about when you give someone a tip and they feel like it is too small of an amount. A recent example is I gave my DoorDash driver a $10 tip for a $15 order, and he told me that it was disrespectful because it was not enough to cover his gas for driving to me. 

It’s little instances like this that make me feel the service industry in America have literally lost their minds when it comes to this whole tipping thing. 

Again I am not a stingy person, I just do not believe that I always have to leave a tip, especially when it comes to bad service.

1c5mgu1,CMV: Everyone would be better off if women were the ones who were expected to make the first move.,"Attention from the opposite gender is like water. Men are desperately thirsty for it, while women are drowning in it.   
Most women don't like being approached randomly in public or being confessed to, while I don't know a single man who wouldn't appreciate being approached. The ""men remember compliments for years"" things is true for a reason. 

On top of that, there is also the aspect of safety, and the current societal expectation of men approaching women has resulted in women being seriously hurt or even killed due to rejecting a man. Women basically have to fear for their safety every time a man approaches them. Again, if women were the ones to approach, this wouldn't be an issue. 

If women were expected to approach, they could go out and not worry about guys hitting on her, and men can finally take a break from always having to be the initiator. Everyone wins.

Iran gets a lot of street cred on the Arab Main Street for attacking ""the nation of genocide."" It probably also achieves its aim of deterring future direct Israeli attacks on its (non-proxy) interests. It has shored up support for the regime at home and humiliated its biggest rivals, the Gulf Monarchies, who were forced to publicly align themselves with Israel.

On the other hand, Israel's biggest enemy at the moment is not Iran - it is Western public opinion. It definitely gained sympathy in the US and Europe last night as being able to present itself as the victim of aggression. For example, it now looks increasingly likely that it will immediately receive extra funding from Washington. It has conclusively demonstrated that its neighbours are now all much  more closely aligned with it than with the Iran bloc. And militarily, what happened was an absolute triumph for the IDF.

Obviously no one can just be completely 100% happy with themselves,(or there are very few who are), and you have to tick all the to do lists in life before settling with someone, that's not what I'm saying.

My point is that unless you are doing the thing you want to do every day, or spending majority of your time doing what you want, you are more unhappy than happy overall. Getting into a relationship is a distraction you gave yourself from the fact you are not happy overall, but think this person will be my happiness, which is wrong imo.

1c7fp7w,CMV: Many of the Gulf States that are allied with the United States are as morally reprehensible as Iran,"American and British politicians love to paint Iran as a great evil of the Middle East, as if it's the only bad actor in town, but I think that a lot of the Gulf States like Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar are just as evil as Iran is. Just like Iran, these countries are authoritarian regimes that heavily restrict the freedom of their people. 

Saudi Arabia is a theocratic monarchy, and it's dominant from of Islamic interpretation, Wahhabism, is notably conservative amongst all Islamic interpretations. Women are only allowed to drive in 2017, and today women are still under the male guardianship system despite improvements over the years. In the Yemen Civil War, Saudi Arabia has been criticised for indiscriminate bombings and intentionally worsening the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. When it comes to suppressing dissent, they famously assassinated Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul because he was a known dissident of Saudi Arabia.

Qatar is also a monarchy and it's known for abusing it's foreign workforce and can be constitute modern slavery. The relationship between them and their employers opens them to be victims of human trafficking and forced labour. If we want to criticise the Iran-backed Houthis for modern slavery, let's not forget our goverments-backed Qatar for the same crime. 

You may then point out that at least they don't fund proxies. Well, they do! Saudi funds their proxies in Yemen, previously in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain and Lebanon to contain Iranian influence in the region. Today the UAE is the biggest supporter of RSF, a genocidal militant force in Sudan that is responsible for numerous massacres. 

The point here is American and British governments only call Iran a ""destabilising force"" or an adversary because of their refusal to align with the West, not because of their immoral or evil actions in the Middle East, because if that's the case we won't be aligning ourselves with most of the Gulf States.",WheatBerryPie,438,0.7699999809265137,385,1713476967,2024-04-18 16:49:27,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7fp7w/cmv_many_of_the_gulf_states_that_are_allied_with/,4,2024
1bxh1yb,CMV: The average person in the United States should not trust the police.,"I’m coming from this from an American perspective but this may or may not be true in other countries. I suspect it is similar in many countries.

The view is simple. The police have a specific job and that job has nothing to do with serving the average person. Police work for the government and enforce the government’s laws and prioritize what the government wants them to prioritize. This mostly ends up meaning they protect rich people’s property and persons from poor people because the government primarily serves the interests of rich people.

The average person simply is not a priority for the government/police until they break a law. It has been ruled by the Supreme Court that the police have no obligation to protect you and it is standard procedure for police to lie to you if they think it’ll get them what they want.

To get ahead of the straw man arguments, no I am not saying the average person doesn’t benefit from the police in any way. I’m not saying the police are necessarily out to get you. I’m not saying your cop brother is an untrustworthy person. I’m specifically saying that the average person should not trust the police as an institution because the police are not necessarily on the average person’s side.",Grandemestizo,414,0.7300000190734863,423,1712424428,2024-04-06 12:27:08,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bxh1yb/cmv_the_average_person_in_the_united_states/,4,2024
1bxoafx,CMV: Labeling sexual/romantic orientations has gotten out of control and is now leading to more problems than solutions,"Hear me out bc ik This is a super hot topic but I asked a mod and its alright as long as this is not about gender identity which I understand and it is not

Please note:

I labeled it 18+ as im sure triggering stuff will be mentioned

Also i swear i don‘t mean to be offensive, I am sure that my argument is missing others povs hence this sub so keep that in mind

And I am specifically talking about romantic/sexual orientation, not gender identity. That is something way different and should not be discussed here at all.

So:

I will always stand for peoples right to exist in peace, surrounded by love and care regardless of your sexual/romantic orientation. I myself am in the pride community.

But I am genuinely so annoyed of reading on forums and subs, ‚i like this person, does that mean I am x orientation?‘

I understand that giving yourself a label is important because it helps you understand yourself. And I understand that back then when not much was known in the mainstream world, labels helped with identification and explanations

But I also see it as just being very limiting and honestly just leads to more confusions than solutions

For instance me:

 I am (i think) asexual and aromantic, I have never once been properly attracted to anyone and honestly find sexual/romantic intimacy to be a no-go. But then there are few moments where I do get to know someone and I do envision a life with them, and so now im here like…wtf am I

And so I googled all the possible labels for my feelings and found out sapiosexual is a thing, and demisexual and so on. That too me is soo damn confusing now… because why do I need a Label that says ‚attraction for me starts when i gained an emotional attraction and such‘. I actually had people argue with me and say ‚if im ace then I can‘t feel sexual attraction period‘ and then others say ‚well no bc xyz exceptions exist‘ so which oen is it? We don‘t know, these labels habe created this divide now

Now im sure the first counter argument is going to be, you don‘t need one but let others have one if they want to

But i say: how do we know if they want one? Maybe they are surrounded so much by labels that they think they need one. Maybe a world can exist where you are who you are and love whoever you want (plz dont bring up nonsense like peddos i ofc don‘t mean them) and thats that.

Like i feel like it is these labels that brings up so much conflict, because labels then come with stereotypes and being boxed in.

And as I mentioned before in my case, I see the pride community struggle with this actually bc we now not only have gay or lesbian and such but we now have graysexual, semisexual etc. because we came to the realization that humans are all on a spectrum, and instead of leaving it at that we feel the need to label everything

I guess for my point to stick, we would have to agree on us being on a fluid spectrum which I understand not everyone agrees on. But if we (those who support it) know there are people who like x person of one group but also sometimes y person of another group, then why do insist on creating new labels rather than just saying ‚ ok this person likes this one but also this person‘ and thats that.

I hope my point is clear, feel free to ask for clarifications.

1byxjde,CMV: Israel is showing extreme callousness towards civilian casualties in their war in Gaza,"5 days ago, [+972 Mag](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/) published an article that focuses on Lavendar AI technology and the IDF approach to civilian casualties. A few other outlets have already reported on this story, so it is likely that the sources have been corroborated and +972 Mag is generally seen as [reliable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/972-magazine/). While most of the focus of the +972 Mag's article is on the AI, there are a few other things that really caught my attention:

>it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians; in the past, the military did not authorize any “collateral damage” during assassinations of low-ranking militants. 

This ratio of 15 to 20 civilians is _absurdly_ high for a low-ranking militant. According to [this article](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/assessing-israel-s-approach-to-proportionality-in-the-conduct-of-hostilities-in-gaza) on proportionality analysis, the US Army generally accepts _ZERO_ for low-ranking militant, anything in the realm of 14 to 15 requires approval from the Secretary of Defense, and for Osama bin Laden the figure is 30. I don't understand how the IDF is permitting its commanders to approve a strike themselves if it kills up to 20 civilians per low-ranking militant.

>they would personally devote only about “20 seconds” to each target before authorizing a bombing — just to make sure the Lavender-marked target is male. This was despite knowing that the system makes what are regarded as “errors” in approximately 10 percent of cases, and is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose connection to militant groups, or no connection at all.

I'm not sure about you, but 10% is a crazy high error rate, because this is additive to the error rate that humans make. This is not some sort of error rate for a sorting machine, this is an error rate of killing people with weaponry. Using this and the information provided above, there's _at least_ a 10% chance that up to 20 civilians will die because of a Lavender error. 

>the commander laments: “We [humans] cannot process so much information. It doesn’t matter how many people you have tasked to produce targets during the war — you still cannot produce enough targets per day.”

This is incredibly dystopian. It feels like the commanders have a target number to hit every day, and because humans aren't capable to hitting that target by ourselves, an AI tool is used to speed up that process, a tool that has very little oversight.

>the Lavender machine sometimes mistakenly flagged individuals who had communication patterns similar to known Hamas or PIJ operatives — including police and civil defense workers, militants’ relatives, residents who happened to have a name and nickname identical to that of an operative, and Gazans who used a device that once belonged to a Hamas operative. 

This is not just a problem that runs deep in Lavender, it runs deep in their training set as well, which means the IDF consistently flag non-Hamas civilians as Hamas members. It puts the number of ""Hamas militant killed"" into question because that figure reported by the IDF must've included a lot of false positives like militants' relatives, nurses, etc.

>We were constantly being pressured: ‘Bring us more targets.’ They really shouted at us. We finished [killing] our targets very quickly.”

This speaks to a more top-down approach and systemic problem to killing Hamas militants. Because of the pressure from higher ups to rake up Hamas death toll, the lower level officials feel pressured to kill without proper oversight or check on intelligence. It feels like someone clocking into work, being demanded to hit some x targets a day, and clock out. There seems to be little consideration for what is the actual threat the targets pose to Israel or IDF. 

>“In the bombing of the commander of the Shuja’iya Battalion, we knew that we would kill over 100 civilians,” 

It's insane to me that a target like Osama bin Laden has an acceptable civilian death ratio of 30, but a commander in Gaza has a ratio of 100. I don't know, this seems very callous to me.


I can go on and on and I can bring up other incidents too like the WCK drone strike, but the point I'm making here is even if the IDF doesn't have a policy to target civilians, they sure as hell ignore civilian casualties in their policy-making. I don't know how this does not amount to a systemic enabling of war crimes. Also, the IDF response (which we have no reason to believe is true) does not deny the claims made by the sources I quoted. They denied some of the interpretations/extrapolations by others, and some of the minor details, but not the central claim of the article or the quotes I put above.",WheatBerryPie,394,0.6600000262260437,856,1712581987,2024-04-08 08:13:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1byxjde/cmv_israel_is_showing_extreme_callousness_towards/,4,2024
1c05z7f,CMV: Religious fundamentalism leads to bad people,"Recently, I’ve been doing a bit of research into altruism and religion. There was a study in 2015 by Jean Decety, since redacted, that claimed that Abrahamic religious children, specifically Christians and Muslims, are less generous, and more likely to be mean to people who aren’t in their own religious sub group. Correcting for errors in data collection showed that actually, children from more rigorous religious households are more likely to be mean to non-members than children from less rigorous religious households. So, right out the gate, fundamentalist children are bigger jerks to non-members. I’m sure this comes as no surprise to anyone on here. We all know the feeling of being looked down on by a religious fundamentalist; they often believe that all non-members are totally doomed, as well as foundationally evil.

However, these campus protests have been cracked down in a manner similar to the Civil Rights Movement back in the 60s. Riot police were deployed before the protests started, peaceful protestors were man handled, some were pushed by the police onto the highway so they would be arrested, some were tasered while handcuffed, it's a violent crack down on peaceful protests.

I've had some recent run in issues with my dating life that I feel as though it's backwards over the past 5 yrs or less. I'm heavily independent. I work two jobs (medical and restaurant). I can cook. Clean. Pay my bills. Have great sense of style. Well mannered and self caring in the best way. 

My issue is that some of my activities I've been told are red flags in the dating world. 

Said things are:

My closest friends are women. They have men. They have families. I have not had sex with them. We respect each other greatly in high regard.

I do ""couples"" activities by myself. I grocery shop. I got to local mall. I go to the movies by myself. I take long drives my myself. I travel to tourist attractions by myself. I go to farmers markets and local fairs and events by myself. 

I don't lock my phone??? Or I put my phone away when they are in my presence and use it less. (this one I've explained as a matter of focus and I'm not hiding something)

Im comfortable with them not texting me, or I text them for 24-48 hours. We all have a a life to live. It happens, life goes on. 

Low social media presence. I have a Facebook for friends and X for hobby groups. 

Going to restaurants by myself or even high end restaurants by myself. 

You get where I'm going with this. 

Now I didn't realize it had became an issue until a recent FWB came in contact with me again and wanted to offer an apology. I accepted to meet up and she explained that she was a Tik-Tok user and she came across videos that covered many things that I do as ""Red Flags"". My face must've spoke for me because she said ""let me explain"" and proceeded to tell me that she watched these videos over a few weeks and came to the conclusion that I was a big walking red flag. I followed up with the fact that we had flawless communication about everything in our lives so I don't see how she reached that conclusion when she knew everything. Needless to say, she felt ashamed. It was only after we stopped talking for a few months and she talked to real women in real life with boyfriends and husbands and etc that she realized she fucked up in her way of thinking. We finished, I accepted, and we went our separate ways. 

Since then I've seen it everywhere. It was like my eyes were opened. Facebook. Reddit. Twitter/X. Instagram. I've even heard some in person. Normal every day stuff that I thought that men were being men, is getting marked as a red flag in dating culture. I don't mean obvious red flags.

 I feel as though it's turning into an escalating issue that's taking away from what real red flags are and what you be keeping your eyes open for. Yes, red flags are a very real thing. I do personally think that it's over reaching in many ways. I think that it sets men up for unknown failure. I also think it's gives new and young Men and women unrealistic expectations and skewed views on what to look for in a partner.

1btq872,CMV: Suicide should be a human right. ,"To put it simply: you do not get to choose to be born. If, one day, you wish to see yourself out, that should be your basic, fundamental human right. Instead though, this is not the case, and voicing such things will get you labeled as crazy. Well, isn't what's crazy forcing someone into the world and not ever allowing them to leave on their own terms? Is it not ""cruel and unusual"" to force a dying animal to stay alive just because you dictate it should, and because it would make you personally more happy? It is. So, why is it different for people? 

And I'm not just talking about the terminally ill. It should be every human's basic right to leave an existence they did not choose to be a part of if and when they choose to leave, rather than forcing them to live until old age.

And, what I mean by ""forcing"", is that if you attempt to take your own life and fail, you don't really get any support. You get locked away and have other liberties stripped from you. That and there is no government mandated 100% safe and certain way to end your life. You're forced to take matters into your own hands with a large margin of error. See my aforementioned point on why that's not acceptable.

There should be a mandated, safe, quick way to leave an existence that you did not get to choose to be part of. If you don't get to choose to be born, which you don't, it should at least be your basic right to leave when you want and in a peaceful, safe fashion.

However, I can’t help but think that many people who say they don’t like cartoons are missing out on amazing stories, stellar animation, and just seeing TONS of hard work and talent being promoted on the screen. Now, as we know, not every animated piece is going to be top notch but I guess I’m looking to see what other view points could be out there that have a person choose live action media with real people as opposed to animated shows.

1cfjdt4,CMV: Most kids can handle and understand mature topics in kids shows as long as it’s presented the right way.,"Avatar the last air bender is a perfect example of this. It’s a “kids show” but deals with the themes of:

•War
•Genocide
•Corruption
•Animal abuse
•Domestic violence
•Sexism
•Racism
•Psychopathy
•Environmental destruction
•Natural disasters
•Grief
•Murder

I could go on but this is mostly what the show deals with and presents. What makes it kid friendly is by focusing on the emotions and consequences of each of these problems (also having no blood or gore helps lol) 

I see no reason why kids can’t learn about mature topics from kids shows as long as it follows the criteria above although my mind is open to change.",testamentfan67,323,0.8899999856948853,127,1714344106,2024-04-28 17:41:46,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cfjdt4/cmv_most_kids_can_handle_and_understand_mature/,4,2024
1cdcbrh,CMV: I believe that forced Conscription is akin to slavery and never justified. A society unwilling or unable too generate enough volunteers for its armed forces is not worth defending.,"Conscription is one of the worst infringements on personal life and liberty: First, young people (usually only men, which is a great injustice) are forced to perform forced labor for their government with very little compensation.

People who refuse to perform that forced labor usually are imprisoned for multiple months (if alternative service is available that does not change anything because it is still forced labor and refusing alternative service too usually will mean imprisonment too).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Secondly, it is even worse if that country is at war: Then the infringement upon the rights of the young people is even greater, because now thy are in massive danger to their life. It is also worth noting that conscripts in almost all circumstances very quickly turn into chess figures that is at the government's disposal for their own politics.

The best instances for this are: The Vietnam War (North Vietnam did not attack the U.S. and did not pose a threat - in fact, after they won in 1975 they did not retaliate).

Even Israel's Gaza War, while in principle justified, could be considered to be prolonged by Netanyahu for ulterior motives.

Similarly, the Ukraine-Russia War, while Ukraine is defending itself, their government refuses to even consider accepting giving any territory to Russia, preferring to sacrifice hundreds of thousands young men on the battlefield. The same applies to Russia, which is also willing to send their people into battle as cannon fodder.

Both countries have instituted measures to ban men from leaving the country. Ukraine deployed tens of thousands of soldiers to their borders with Nato countries with orders to shoot anyone trying to leave the country. Hundreds of men have perished trying to escape Ukraine.

This reminds me very sadly of the criminal activities by communist East Germany, which also shot people at the border who tried to escape the country.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In my opinion, these massive infringement upon the rights of individuals bears no justification whatsoever. While I do see the need to ensure national defense, I do not think that if the government, the society as a whole, is not able or willing to institute the necessary measures relying solely on volunteers, then this country and its people are to blame for themselves if they get conquered - because apparently, there were not enough people voluntarily defending it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I would also stress that in modern military technology, there is no real need of conscription because, for example, a strong air force of hundreds of modern fighter jets, as well as drones, plus an army with many tanks, artillery pieces, rocket artillery and similar technology, will beat a large army of men armed with rifles.

The farthest I would be willing to compromise on would be to formally have conscription (for all genders, of course), but if one refuses they will only face a fine, for example $ 1,000, and no other consequences at all. This way, some people who would not join the army on their own iniative, but are not actually opposed to it, would enlist because they formally have that duty. On the other hand, anyone really opposed to conscription would not be held to forced labor nor harshly punished, but basically giving a small contribution to national defense with their money.",dwujd,312,0.6200000047683716,597,1714105491,2024-04-25 23:24:51,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cdcbrh/cmv_i_believe_that_forced_conscription_is_akin_to/,4,2024

1byyvoa,CMV: The abortion debate should not be framed as men vs. women,"I’m not here to argue about whether or not abortion should be legal. However for reference I am pro-choice and a man.

I often see some feminists decreeing that Roe vs. Wade being overturned as part of the patriarchy, and criticizing the men who are pro life as sexist. 

I fully acknowledge that women are more affected by abortion restrictions than men. That being said, as a man I’m don’t benefit from stronger abortion laws at ALL. If I unintentionally get a girl pregnant that I’m not in a relationship with, I have to pay child support for the next 18 years. Yes it’s much harder on the woman since she has to carry the child and breast feed, but my life would get worse as well. 

Polls in the United States would also show that women aren’t that much more likely to be pro choice either. 55% of women identify as pro choice vs. 48% of men. 

Really the debate should be framed as religious vs. non-religious since religious people feel that abortion is evil and killing an innocent life, while non-religious people don’t see it as a life and don’ think the government should interfere what someone does with their body.

A better example of a men vs. women issue would be the gender pay gap. One could argue that could impact both gender’s salary depending on how much you want to enforce   equal pay.",Tobes_macgobes,297,0.7599999904632568,936,1712585497,2024-04-08 09:11:37,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1byyvoa/cmv_the_abortion_debate_should_not_be_framed_as/,4,2024
1cdrc81,"CMV: we should ban entirely the use of ""your honor"" in reference to judges of any kind in a courtroom","Disclaimer: I'm American and have no idea what customs are in courtrooms elsewhere. 

At the founding of the US, there was some question of what to call the executive, George Washington. 

Some had floated ""your highness"" or ""your grace."" Washington rejected these titles, settling simply on ""Mr. President,"" which at the time had very minimal prestige associated with it (for example, a head of a book club). Happily, this trend has continued. Mr. President has stuck.

How on earth do we call even traffic court judges ""your Honor"", including in second person (""your honor mentioned earlier ________"" instead of ""you mentioned earlier"")? I'm watching the immunity trial and it seems absurd.

Not only is it an inversion of title and authority, it seems like blatant sucking up to someone who will presumably have a lot of power over your life, or your case. 

We don't call bosses your honor, we don't call doctors that save lives your honor, we use the term *only* for people who could either save or ruin our lives, or at a minimum give us slack on parking tickets.

I would propose that a law be passed to ban the term in all courts, federal and state, and henceforth judges should be addressed as ""Judge _______"". 

Copied from another answer:

Imagine a boss insisted all his employees to refer to him as “His Majesty,” or “Your Holiness,"" and not abiding by this was fireable.

1cgtgm2,CMV: There aren’t any crimes presidents should be able to commit as part of “Official Acts”,"In the recent Supreme Court hearings on absolute presidential immunity, Trump’s team made the case that presidents need absolute immunity to prosecution for ""official acts"" to engage in ""bold and fearless"" action. The Republican justices seemed to buy this argument. At first, this seemed to make sense to me - presidents should be a bit less constrained in their actions than other people, right? But, as I consider what that would actually mean, I’m struggling to think of a crime that I think a president should be able to commit as part of an “Official act.""

Here’s how I’ve though about this: If I’m going to accept the proposition that a President should be able to commit crimes with impunity in the commission of their “official acts"" because the president would otherwise be too constrained, I should be able to identify hypothetical situations where the most desirable outcome would require the president to knowingly (or recklessly or negligently) order a subordinate to do something criminal. I am struggling to invent such a situation, so I’m inclined to believe that a president shouldn’t get any criminal immunity at all for their “official acts.” CMV.",GiraffeRelative3320,287,0.8299999833106995,352,1714485384,2024-04-30 08:56:24,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cgtgm2/cmv_there_arent_any_crimes_presidents_should_be/,4,2024
1cadgf3,CMV: There has never been a good representation of Arab people in American media ,"I am Lebanese-Canadian and I struggled so much as a kid never seeing my Arab culture represented correctly or even just seeing Arab people always play the villains or terrorists in movies and tv shows. Still to this day I think any Arab character I’ve ever seen in popular media has been incredibly inaccurate or racist.  I think people veiw the Arab countries as too much of a controversial subject to put into media as a main character hero or protagonist. Anytime Americans see depictions of Arab culture their brain Immidiatly associates it with war, terrorism, and Islamophobia. No positive depictions of Arab people in popular media is only continuing the anti Arab narrative. When I was in middle school I had people classmates asking me and my siblings if we were a part of ISIS. Positive Arab representation would help squash this racism so fast I feel. I want to have my opinion changed because I would love to see some people say examples of accurate Arab representation that I’ve never seen before. But I have never seen any therefore it’s my opinion. 

Some caviats: 

1. I am specifically talking about popular western media so projects made by the USA/canada/europe not films that were made in Arab countries
 
2. I am not saying I hate the original Alladin but as much as I loved it as a kid it is incredibly flawed and their “representation” is just racist stereotypes. I have a lot of beef with the alladin live action remake because they put no effort into making it actually representative of Arab countries and cultures and characters so I just count that movie as a tasteless cash grab with no actual attempt to do any proper representation.

3. Indian/East Asian films and shows don’t count. I am specifically talking about Arab countries like Lebanon, Iran, Egypt, Morocco for example. I want to give Ms. Marvel kudos for being really good Muslim and Pakistani representation but I can’t count it in this because I’m talking about Arab in particular. 


The closest thing I’ve seen of popular proper Arab representation is Moon Knight. The main charachter isn’t Arab just the setting so I don’t count it. But the Arab music is fire so it gets kudos from me. The work they did to make the setting accurate was enough to make me happy. I want my opinion to be changed because I would LOVEE to see some people put from good Arab representation media in the comments and prove me wrong. In order for it to count, the main character, protagonist, or hero has to be an accurately represented Arab character, preferably in an Arab country or setting. Side characters can also MAYBE change my opinion depending how relevant they are to the media. The whole point is it’s proper representation not just a token Arab character that has zero depth.

1c42xtn,CMV: The reason society feels so polarised and surreal at the moment is because we have never had access to information at the rate that we do today,"I'm sure society feels surreal, at least to anyone that spends time on the internet, which I think is most people. And I think it's because social media and the internet have given us access to unbelievable amounts of information that simply didn't exist before. Not just information such as research papers and what not which have existed for a long time, but with tiktok we literally have millions of people giving their life experiences and how it's made them feel every day. We are getting to see how individual people perceive life and society at rates that we never have before.

Society essentially cannot handle this. Historically, different people and cultures have been taught and brought up on different narratives. Today, the narratives are being challenged through this mass sharing of experience and information. It's as if the essence of society is imploding on itself. That's my view anyway.",proverbs109,283,0.8999999761581421,70,1713125511,2024-04-14 15:11:51,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c42xtn/cmv_the_reason_society_feels_so_polarised_and/,4,2024

1c7ibn3,CMV: Housing should not be an investment ,"I don’t believe that it’s good that housing is viewed as an investment. The problems I see from this are that: 

1 - this makes housing artificially more expensive than it should be and leads to homelessness and people spending too much money on rent/mortgage.

2 - housing as investment provides an incentive for home owners to be nimby’s. A class of people is created that now oppose the construction of new housing because this makes their homes less valuable.

3 - it’s a poor place to store wealth. Having wealth tied up in housing isn’t economically productive. Would it be better for the economy if your house cost $50k or 500k? If it was only 50k, you could diversify your wealth. You could buy bonds to help fund companies or the government. You could buy stocks. You could just spend it and put it right into the economy. 

I’m not saying that all housing should cost the same. A 4,000 sq foot apartment in NYC is always going to cost way more than a 700 sq foot apartment in Oklahoma City. But I don’t believe the price of housing (rents or home prices) should be expected to rise faster than inflation. 

How would it be achievable? Simple - build more housing. Tons of it. And most of it should be non-profit housing. This is housing - ideally apartment buildings - that is deed restricted to not increase rent above costs of the building. 

This would be a huge net benefit for society. ",eriksen2398,268,0.7400000095367432,501,1713483672,2024-04-18 18:41:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7ibn3/cmv_housing_should_not_be_an_investment/,4,2024
1cdekyt,CMV: violence against Asian-Americans does not receive enough media coverage.,"CMV: Asian-Americans are being attacked but nobody cares unless the perpetrator is white. 

I've seen dozens of videos of Asian Americans being killed, assaulted, and robbed. I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not. It's very sad to see people that look like my parents or grandparents being attacked or killed. Not to mention the thousands of incidents where Asians are victimized without violence, or the ones that are not caught on CCTV or cellphone videos. Asians are being attacked and it is not being acknowledged. The media will not report on these incidents unless it is a white person, as evidenced by the coverage of the Atlanta murders compared to violent crimes committed by other minorities. 

Just a few that come to mind when it comes to violence that is recorded:

- elderly Asian man picking up cans and being assaulted by a group of young men in the bay area
- elderly Asian woman being set on fire in New York
- elderly Asian man being violently shoved and later dying of his injuries in the bay area
- elderly Asian woman robbed and killed in the bay area
- elderly Asian woman in New York being punched and kicked 60+ times 
- asian woman in Houston being slammed and paralyzed
- asian woman dragged by a vehicle after being robbed in the bay area
- asian woman being ran over and killed in Las Vegas
- gangs specifically targeting asians and their businesses

And there are many more that I have forgotten to list, and those are just the incidents that aren't recorded or reported. 

People often mention the LA riots in conversations about Anti-Asian violence, especially when it comes to the murder of Latasha Harlins, but they fail to mention the constant victimization of Soon Ja Du, she had visible injuries from that day. She was thrown under the bus by the media and it became the justification for hundreds or thousands of Asian businesses being destroyed along with the countless Americans that it impacted. This is just the most extreme example. 

There has not been enough media coverage on these specific incidents. There has not been the type of movements that were evoked when other injustices are committed. There is no real action that has been undertaken by the the government in stopping the violence against Asians. And there is a general disdain for Asian people that is not being addressed. 

I get that there is a lot of intersectionality that is in play, asians inhabit the same spaces as other marginilized people, but that doesn't mean that they should be left out to dry. 

There is a lot more that needs to be covered, these examples are only the recent ones, but historically speaking, there are many more examples that are being ignored, not just by me, but in general. 

And I will acknowledge the racist sentiments that are held within the Asian community, it does exist, and it has led to discriminatory actions against other minorities. 

Conclusion: I believe that Asian Americans are being attacked, but it is not being acknowledged by the media or general populace when it is done by other visible minorities/marginilized groups. There is a media bias to protect certain groups, and an emphasis on when the crimes are committed by white people.

1c8si60,"CMV: The reason there’s so much loneliness in America today is because we’ve replaced the traditional institutions of community in America with social media and the internet, which are half-measures at best and actively harmful at worst.","Humans are, in my opinion, naturally lazy creatures who will always choose the path of least resistance in almost anything. This includes communication. Throughout most of human history our sense of community was connected to our ability to travel to meet other people or other peoples ability to travel to us. 

The postal service, mail, letters, tv radio shows and phones all altered the equation but none more fundamentally then the internet did. The internet offered something unique. The *closest* simulation you could get to having a person/people in the room with you while also being alone. It has the trappings of community but none of the soul. 

In addition to that, and this isn’t me blaming women it’s just observation, feminism. The increased freedom of movement allowed for women, the loosening of divorce laws and attitudes toward it, the slow, uneven elaxing of standards and expectations for women in general hurt it. 

Men in American aren’t socialized to be vulnerable and needy except when it comes to women. Women are far more comfortable openly expressing a want to be wanted by other women. Men, while still feeling the same things, just don’t do that for other men. Not openly at least. Because of fear of judgment etc. all this to say, women are socialized to be more…well, social. 

As wives and gfs and mothers they’re often responsible for organizing birthday parties, family reunions and holiday events. They’re the ones keeping in contact. Men are socialized and allowed to be more self centered in how they interact with women but especially other men. We just don’t care to ask each other deeper questions about our lives and society enables this in part by women taking up that extra burden and encouraging or scheduling actual events for us to take part in. 

And as birth rates have gone down, social institutions have declined, and women have more choice and higher standards for their partners, on a macroscopic level we’re seeing community tires fray and drift more.
