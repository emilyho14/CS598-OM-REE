18cgr86,AITA for expressing to my in-laws that I don't want to be their server for their family's Christmas dinner?,"So, I'm a newlywed, and my in-laws are rolling into town for Christmas and staying my husband's and my new house. They mentioned wanting to dine out for Christmas dinner, but I offered to whip up a home-cooked feast instead. Unfortunately, they turned down the offer.  
Now, here's where it gets interesting. I am currently working as a server in our town after recently being laid off from my corporate job. Lucky for me, the restaurant is closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas.  
Well, turns out my mother-in-law had other plans. She called up my workplace without speaking to me beforehand and asked for me to be their server for their entire Christmas dinner. I found out through my husband that I'd be playing the role of their server for their festive family celebration, and my Christmas ""gift"" would be a sweet tip and takeout from my restaurant.  
Seems a bit odd, especially since our restaurant isn't even open on Christmas Eve or Christmas and I'd be available to spend time with them on those days. They're scheduling this dinner the day before we close and making it their designated family celebration. 

I politely declined because, let's be real, being excluded from Christmas dinner while working as their server? That's a hard pass from me. 

Unfortunately, I was told that I was being dramatic and there's nothing weird about me being their server for their family's Christmas dinner.

18bq4pd,AITA for telling my parents that my kids won’t attend christmas if everyone can’t attend?,"My husband was injured when we were in high school (almost 18 years ago now) and uses a wheelchair now. We have four children—his 15 year old son from a previous relationship, an 8 year old daughter, a 5 year old son and a 1 year old daughter. 

My parents usually host a big Christmas every year with all of the kids and their families. Sometimes it’s at their home and sometimes it’s at a vacation destination. In previous years it’s always been accessible for my husband, but this year they’ve chosen to have it at a mountain/ski resort that is largely inaccessible and would have a lot of activities that would leave my husband out, so we told them we were going to do our own thing for christmas this year. No biggie, right? They responded with “how about you send the kids and you can do your own thing.” 

we responded that we wouldn’t be sending our kids and that if we couldn’t all attend, nobody would attend. They’re upset and accusing us of withholding the kids from something that brings them joy and being bad parents.

18gy5rr,AITA for not passing on an “heirloom” to my daughter in law?,"I am 48F and my eldest is 22M. He’s been with his fiancée (DIL) since they were 20 and he wants to marry her.

I’d always liked her before now, she’s a smart girl, she fits in well with the family, she’s driven, and she makes my son happy. Everything was all roses until they got engaged.

Now since I was little I was fascinated with jewellery. When I was older and married and had my own income I started to collect rings.

I would “design” them myself, used to ask friends and family to give me cash I could put towards them, and save up my disposable income towards whatever ring I wanted.

*Edit 2: Okay apparently this above paragraph is controversial. It is the custom of my family since always to give cash in celebrations. It’s also very normal in my community to ask your friends to give cash - I have done this myself for my friends.*

*HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF EACH PIECE OF JEWELLERY WAS ALWAYS BORNE BY ME. Whatever I got from birthdays was a bonus top up - not something I relied on to be able to afford it.*

It would be less than 10% of each piece definitely not the bulk. 10% being the highest but mostly it was around the 3-4% mark if any.

*Sorry but quite a few comments are being derailed by this*

I wasn’t buying one every year but over time I have a nice collection of rings. My favourite are a sapphire with a halo of diamonds, an emerald in a trilogy with 1ct diamonds either side, and a Ruby set in a pavé band.

After son got engaged and we invited him and DIL to dinner at home, DIL asked to speak to me. She said she’s been seeing my emerald ring over the years and she has always wanted one.

She pointed out that I wear it least often, which is true, and demanded that I gift it to her as an heirloom engagement ring. This is in addition to other wedding gifts and expenses we had discussed as a family during dinner. This includes gold to the value of approximately £6000 which is honestly more than my entire wedding cost, and which I still think is a significant amount.

This rubbed me the wrong way and I admit I accused her of trying to pick through my estate before I’m even dead. I told her the ring is mine and I can even sell it on my deathbed if I want to; she has no right to expect it and she’s being a rude brat by demanding it.

She yelled at me that something like this can’t just be sold, it should be an heirloom and it’s normal for heirlooms to
Be passed on while the wearer is still alive.

I told her to leave if she was just in my home to demand my property and she stormed out, taking my son with her.

She’s mad at me and son says I should’ve just passed the ring to her since I have others and it would
Be a nice gesture to welcome her to the family! He says it’s no different than his sister occasionally borrowing some of my pieces.

My husband and my daughter are on my side but this is the first time my son has shut me out like this so AITA?

(Edit: DIL has an engagement ring already. It’s beautiful and I would call it expensive. This is not a case of her being proposed to without a ring.)",Existing_Ring_,8427,0.9599999785423279,2636,1702419209,2023-12-12 16:13:29,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gy5rr/aita_for_not_passing_on_an_heirloom_to_my/,12,2023
18k3ejh,AITA for not letting my husband eat the food I cooked?,"My husband has food insecurity and over-eats even when he's not hungry; out of fear of it all being eaten before he gets to taste it. Every item of snacks/soda in this house that is bought is gone within a few days because he binges until it's gone. AND he has in the past told the kids they couldn't have more dinner because there ""wasn't enough"", just so he could eat it later. I was at work for that one. I did make him get therapy but it's not doing much good because he doesn't apply himself at all (thinks it's pointless and refuses to do the steps they provide). 

Today I bought stuff for lasagna and bought myself a big salad because I can't eat red sauce. Within an hour of being home he was already in the fridge asking if he could have my salad because he was starving. I said no originally but he kept prying and said ""c'mon, please? I will share it with you."" I said ""what the fuck ever"" and walked off. He left me 3 bites. I tossed it in the trash. This was not even 10 minutes before I started cooking. He said multiple times ""I'm so full"" or ""now my belly hurts"" or ""I ate too much"". Which is common for him. But I was still salty about it honestly. So, I only made half a sheet pan of the lasagna, which would only feed the kids. Husband said he was ""so full"" anyways.  

I give the kids their food 20 minutes later (I prep so cooking takes zero time at all). I tell them they can finish the pan off. Well, my husband comes out and sees the lasagna and says ""oo, that's what I'm talking about"". I said ""absolutely not. You just ate my dinner and you were full 30 minutes ago. This is the kids food."" (I didn't say this in front of the kids). He says I'm a ""royal bitch"" because he ""needs"" the lasagna and it's going to ""send him backwards"" because now I'm ""withholding food from him"".",Unique_Youth1201,6675,0.9700000286102295,1238,1702768801,2023-12-16 17:20:01,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18k3ejh/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_eat_the_food_i/,12,2023
18tzlbv,AITA for leaving Christmas dinner early because my SIL wanted to name her daughter the same name as mine but spelt different?,"I'm a 30f and my husband is a 32m. We have one daughter, Madelyn (8f). I have a SIL, Jasmin (32f) and she has been having infertility issues for a while now and has had a couple of miscarriages. Jasmin and I aren't that close but we're friendly to each other.   
  
She got pregnant a few months ago and she had her gender reveal party about 2 weeks ago. Everyone was so excited and happy when we found out she was having a girl.  
  
During this year's family Christmas dinner, she announced that she was going to name her kid Madelyn, but spelt differently of course! (as if that made it any better) Her daughter's name was going to be Madilyn. I was completely shocked. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect that Jasmin would want to name her kid Madelyn as well. If she told me before we named our daughter, I probably would've taken that into consideration before naming her.  
  
I asked Jasmin why she would want to name her daughter the same name as mine, and she said that technically it wasn't the same name since it was going to be spelt different. She also said that her great aunt's name was also Madilyn and that she thought that Madilyn was a cute name. Jasmin also mentioned that Madilyn was supposed to be the name of her kid before she had a miscarriage (this was before Madelyn was born). I never even knew that was what she wanted to name her kid because she never told anyone!  
  
I was really upset and told her she could've just told me before I named my daughter that she also wanted to name her daughter Madelyn. She said that I was always such a witch and that I probably would've named my daughter Madelyn either way. I don't even know what I ever did to this woman. I then asked what we were going to do about the confusion of them having the same name and she told me we could use my daughter's middle name! Like, what? I told her if anything, we should be calling her daughter by her middle name since my daughter came first.   
  
We went back and forth a few more times before I decided to leave early with my husband and Madelyn. My daughter was also pretty confused and asked why her aunt would want to name her daughter the same name as her. I'm still really upset and hopes she changes her mind, but this morning my BIL texted me and said that I should try to better understand Jasmin and her feelings. I texted him back and told him that she should stop being such a witch and try to understand my feelings instead.

18oqjjy,AITA for not buying my son a car like I did for the rest of his siblings.,"I (49M) have four kids, twin boys (both 27), one girl (25F) and another son (21M). This post is about my youngest son, Jack. Since they were children, I promised my kids two things, one, I’ll fully pay for all of their college expenses (housing/tuition/food etc) and two, once they graduate college, I will buy them a car. I kept that promise for all my kids, except with Jack and now I want to know if I am an asshole for that. I paid for Jack’s college expenses, but I am refusing to buy him a car, below is some of the reasons why:

1. I co signed my name on the lease for Jack’s room that he rents with a friend, and I send Jack his portion of the rent every month. The friend started taking advantage of my name being on the lease and stopped paying for rent too, knowing I will cover the amount because I don’t want missed payments on my credit score. I asked Jack multiple times to ask his roommate to pay his portion, but the boy did not care to even respond to me and I ended up paying for six months of his friend’s rent too until I finally solved the problem by getting my name out of the lease.
2. Jack have a very rude and entitled attitude. He speaks to us like we are his low performing employees, the only time he contacts us is when he wants money and goes no contact otherwise, and we don’t know what we ever did to him to treat us that way.
3. Last year when my wife had to be hospitalized, all of my kids flew back home to be there for their mother. Jack didn’t want to but one of his siblings bought him a ticket and talked him into flying out. Instead of being glad to be beside his very sick mother at the hospital, he spent the entire visit making everyone run errands for him (his sister has to cook a very specific type of meal for him/we had to drive him to the gym at a very specific time he demands etc) and acted like it was one huge inconvenience for him to have to fly out.

I even talked to my other kids about  whether we were bad parents that caused Jack to act this way but all my other kids don’t know why he ended up so entitled and spoilt. The rest of my kids are extremely different  from Jack, we all get along with each other and care about one another.  For the rest of my kids, I spent maybe $100K on each kid’s total college expenses.  With Jack’s  careless spending habits and unwillingness to save us any money, Jack’s college years ended up costing me $180k. So I refused to buy the promised car. Jack’s upset and has gone to his grandparents complaining about me. My MIL already hates me and now is calling me an asshole saying I am playing favourites because I bought everyone a car and not Jack.",Ill_Air_2551,5730,0.9599999785423279,1170,1703283670,2023-12-22 16:21:10,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18oqjjy/aita_for_not_buying_my_son_a_car_like_i_did_for/,12,2023
18huhjo,AITA for staying with my parents and refusing to come home unless it is in the condition I left it whenever my in-laws visit.,"My husband cannot control his family. Or at least he refuses to. When his parents visit and give us shit for ""forcing"" our kids to do chores he gives in and the house slowly becomes a mess that I have been left to clean up. When his siblings visit we are expected to clean up after them. I never agreed to this so now I leave. 

I lock my office up and go to my parents' house. I meet up with his family at restaurants or other public places. 

His parents have learned now that when they visit they have to clean up after the kids or get them or my husband to do it. They tried saying that I was abusive for refusing to do housework while they visited. So I posted a picture of my home before they came and one I took during their last visit. I asked them why the house was so messy and dirty and did they have anything to do with it. They said it wasn't their mess. I replied that the house was clean before they showed up. Once they started getting dogpiled for messing up my house they threw the kids under the bus. They said my kids were uncontrollable and it was their mess. I pointed out that there was no mess until they came so obviously my kids were able to clean up.after themselves when there weren't people telling them not to. 

My husband's siblings have cancelled plans to visit because they know I won't be there to clean up after them or cook so they will have to cook or spend money on takeout and restaurants. Great outcome in my opinion. 

My husband says that I'm being unfair putting all the work of cleaning up on him. I said he has two children to help him as well as ADULT guests who should be able to not make a mess. I also told him he could just pay a cleaning service out of his discretionary funds if he wanted to let his family run rampant and not clean up after them. 

He said that I was being mean by not contributing and making him spend his money. I asked how much he normally spends on cleaning the house. The answer is nothing since the four of us keep the house clean and tidy when we are on our own.",Adept-Entrepreneur44,5263,0.9800000190734863,517,1702510149,2023-12-13 17:29:09,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18huhjo/aita_for_staying_with_my_parents_and_refusing_to/,12,2023
18epys4,AITA for refusing to switch my son to an all vegan diet?,"I (22F) have a three year old with my ex (27M). When I found out I was pregnant we were together for two years and he had proposed two months before. It was public, we both posted about it. At first he was excited but when I was seven months he broke up with me and moved out. I asked if he was going to be involved and he said no and blocked me everywhere.


Our son is three now. Earlier this year he reached out to me saying hes matured and regrets not being in our sons life. I asked how hes matured and whats changed in the three years hes been no contact and he said that he has a new lifestyle and this and that. Come to find out hes married to a hardcore hippie vegan and living a completely different life. He lives on a farm now and has a lot of animals, none he makes profit off of. I was beyond shocked. He also doesnt smoke or drink and is just so… different. I spoke to my boyfriend, friends, and parents and they said to give him a chance.


He offered to start paying for his daycare and has been since May. I allowed him to meet my son in a supervised setting at the farm (I wanted to see the horses and animals lol) and met his wife. She inherited the farm and completely redesigned it. She was teaching me and my sisters about her raw organic vegan lifestyle and fed us a potato stew she made. It was really good and I thought things went well. They seemed trustable.


We’ve done a few more supervised visits throughout the year and I only now feel comfortable letting him stay overnights alone. They feed him vegan and I dont mind. The issue is they sat me down recently and asked that I start feeding him vegan full time since its much better for him and the world and that since he wants more involvement it makes sense he has a plantbased lifestyle. I said no, I myself am not vegan and they are not even the vegan chicken nuggets from Walmart type, they are the strictly raw fruits and vegetables type and thats asking me to learn a whole other type of cooking. They offered to meal prep during my time. He said in 2024 he wants 50/50 custody but that if I be “difficult” he will go for full custody siting our age and income difference and that I still live with my parents. I told him by threatening me he can see me in court and left. 


One of my sisters that came with me to a few of the visits has been vegetarian for many years now and she says Im being unreasonable since its healthier for him and they even offered to cook all his meals. And that by eating vegan for a while, it will mess up his digestive system if he eats meat and to just choose one and that since its a lifestyle for them and he will be involved in it, to just agree or Im the asshole?

189gl9c,AITA for telling my “boyfriends” kid I don’t intend on being her mom?,"TLDR: I helped my casual BF out by watching his kid while he went to a job interview. She didn’t want to abide by my house rules because “I’m not her mom and never will be” and I told her “I’m not trying to be your mom. I have my own kids.” 
**writing on mobile**

Context: 
I’ve (34F) have been in a casual long distance relationship for 2 years with “Matt” (40M). I set boundaries at the start of our relationship. We will never live together, he will not be involved with my kids or family, I won’t be involved in his. My kids have a dad that’s very active in their lives and we coparent amazingly. The relationship I have with Matt is just that, with *him*.  Matt agreed to these terms. Everything has been great. We never argue because we have nothing to argue about. We have our separate lives and when we’re together it’s like a break from the real world. 

Matt is relocating closer to me because he’s grown tired of the city and wants to live in a more rural place like I currently live in. He will still be roughly over an hour away so it’s within comfort. His daughter “Ava” is 12 and he was unable to leave her home as his mom had a slip and fall and wasn’t comfortable watching Ava while she was on heavy medication, she just wants to rest. He wasn’t comfortable leaving her at the hotel alone so he asked me to watch her. I agreed and we both understood it’s a one time thing. 

He tells Ava I’m an old friend but I’m guessing she’s heard my name before (it’s not a traditional American name) because of what follows.

 She was being hateful to my daughter “Rose” (11), making fun of the blemishes my daughter has on her chin. I asked Ava if she wanted to go to the basement to play any of the games down there, she said no so I told Rose to go to the basement. She did.

I then catch Ava slowly opening the basement door and I ask her to go to the living room. She refuses and opens the basement door all the way. I tell her she is not allowed down there right now but she’s welcomed to the Wii in the living room or she can pick a movie to stream. We go back and forth, then I walk to the basement door and shut it. She starts screaming at me that I’m not her mom so don’t try to act like it. That’s when I told her “Baby, it never crossed my mind because I have my own kids to parent. I have no intention of trying to be anything to you, I’m just helping your dad.” 
She went to the living room and occupied herself with her phone. I made lunch, served it, she didn’t touch it (it was sopita and cheese quesadillas). Her dad picked her up later and when he got back to the hotel he called me about what I said. He said he understands why I said what I said and it is true, but it was out of pocket to say it TO her.

18a5kxa,AITA for kicking out my sister in law after she lost my son while babysitting,"Over the past three months, my husband's sister has been staying with us until she got back on her feet. As part of her contribution to our household, she generously offered to babysit our kids, including our 3-year-old son with autism and with both delayed speech and language, without expecting any compensation.

However, about three weeks ago while she was babysitting, our son managed to slip out of the front door without her awareness, wandering around for approximately half an hour before a concerned individual alerted the police. 

Rather than immediately notifying my husband and I about the situation, she spent an hour searching the neighborhood before involving law enforcement. We only became aware of our son's disappearance after she had already found out that the police had picked him up and safely returned him home. There's uncertainty regarding whether she would have informed us if the police had not explicitly instructed her to do so.

In the aftermath I asked her to leave our home. My husband believes that my decision to kick her out was overly severe, labeling it as an honest mistake that could happen to anyone. He also emphasizes her lack of alternative living arrangements, arguing that it was “unjust” to leave her with nowhere else to go. She put my son’s safety at risk and broke my trust and I can’t get over that, but I can’t shake what my husband said. Now I feel terrible about putting her on the street.

18n7j4y,AITA for my girlfriend having to wait to be picked up from the airport,"So my girlfriend (F26) went out of town for the weekend and I (M26) dropped her off and picked her up. Her flight was scheduled to get back at 7:40pm Sunday night. On Sunday I went to dinner at my parents house and was going to go directly from dinner to pick her up. 

During dinner I was checking her flight status to make sure I was going to be on time. The last I checked was at 7pm and it said her flight was going to arrive at 7:28. At 7:12, as I was leaving to go to the airport, I got a text from my girlfriend saying she landed, followed by a text asking why I was still at my parents house. I said I was just leaving and would be there in about 35 minutes. She texted back and said she was “so fucking pissed”, and “don’t bother, I’m going to get an Uber”, “it’s extremely irresponsible”, “you better have a damn good excuse”… to quote a few of the texts I got on the way to the airport. 

Anyway, she ended up having to wait about 15 minutes for me to get her. She says that she shouldn’t have to wait to be picked up at the airport and that I should have given myself more time just in case her flight was earlier. To me, I don’t understand why I should have to be the one to wait in the cell phone lot, especially when I’m doing a favor (which she says me taking her to the airport and picking her up is not a favor, just something I should do). In my opinion, for a flight that landed 16 minutes before the flight tracking said it would, waiting 15 minutes is not that bad and should be understandable. 

But let me know if I’m wrong! She said she talked to people about it and they all say she’s right… and I don’t like talking about relationship issues with people that know both of us.

18t89ry,AITA for telling my daughter she needs to move out before getting engaged?,"Leah is 20 & is currently working part time while attending community college part time. She contributes a small percentage of her income (less than 20%) to help with rent/utilities/household expenses and the rest is hers to save/spend. She doesn't have a car and doesn't pay for any other expenses (insurance, etc) as those are all covered.

She's been dating her girlfriend Sophie for almost two years now and they're serious about each other. They're long-ish distance (about an hour away from each other) and only see each other once a month or so. Sophie lives with her family still as well, only she doesn't pay for household expenses and isn't responsible for any chores. Recently they seem to be getting really hype on talking/fantasizing about getting married and picking out engagement rings &tc. 

Last night Leah was telling me all these plans. ""Sophie is going to get me a sapphire engagement ring when she proposes"" ""I think I'm going to wear (x)"" 

And I was like ""It all sounds really nice hon, but I hope you're keeping your priorities in line. If you're grown enough to put a ring on your finger, you're grown enough to move out and support yourself.""

Leah wasn't happy to hear that and said they can move in together when they get married, and being engaged wouldn't really make any difference so why should she have to move out right away if they get engaged.

& I told her that personally, I don't believe in marrying someone you've never lived with. I think it's terrifically short-sighted, especially because Sophie is 21 and her mom still does everything for her. But also because neither of them truly understand the responsibilities and pressures of supporting themselves. Especially in the current economy. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with having these fantasies and dreams with a partner, and I emphasized that. My intention was to caution her against getting swept away in it/prioritizing it above other milestones that would help her survive independently.

She told her aunt (my sister) about the conversation later and her aunt called me and chewed me out for spitting on a harmless romantic fantasy. I said if it's really that harmless, she shouldn't be bothered by the idea of having to wait.

18ild48,"AITA Telling my mum to grieve in her own time, not at all or after my brother has passed?","My (23m) brother (18m) was diagnosed with cancer a few months ago. Its terminal and hes expected to pass within a year but that *could* change if we are lucky but with the type of cancer its unlikely. 

I just want to focus on giving my brother the best time for the time he does have left. The problem is our mother. She is putting her grief onto my brother and he has to sit around helping people grive the life hes going to lose rather than giving him a great life for how ever long he want. 

I understand grieving, i am too but i dont put that on him and its not like i want my mum to go through it alone but my brother is NOT the person to share her greif with. 

The other night i saw out mum just crying and holding him saying she doesnt want to lose him. Afterwards when my brother was asleep i told her she needs to stop grieving for him in fornt of him and if she cant do that she shouldnt at all. That shes making her own dying son deal with her own grief when hes already dealing with his own mortality. She should be supporting him, not the other way around. If she wants support she can talk to me, dad or a therapist but don put your shit on him. 

I do think i was a bit harsh, but it comes from a place of frustration.

18dziyq,AITA for telling my son's mom she can have him for Xmas if she pays for a summer vacation?,"I share custody of my 8yo son Elliot with my ex. It's mostly split and we have a calendar that we revise if needed. Usually we swap him every week but around holidays we extend the times. So the ex gets him for half of this month and I get the other half.

The reasoning for this month's schedule is that she was planning on spending Xmas with her SO back at his home state. I wasn't planning on traveling. Just Xmas at home. This week the ex said her SO wanted to take her and Eli on a skiing Xmas holiday and could she actually have him the last two weeks of December. 

I said so let me get this straight. You have him for two weeks already and now you're asking for another two weeks. Where does that leave me? She told me we can talk about afterwards. I said no, we can't. I'll tell you what. You give me money upfront so he and I can take a summer vacation. 

She said that was outrageous. I said not as outrageous as asking me to give up my time up front and your refusing to give me anything up front in return. And yes, I'd be willing to negotiate if I aaked her to give up her time and let it be known and not hang up like she did.

18d7ray,AITA for not letting my brother take credit for a pricey gift I got for his daughter?,"Heya Reddit!

So some backstory to start: I (32f) have an older brother Rob (37m). Rob has three kids (15f, 8m, & 6m). His two younger boys are he and his wife's kids, where as his oldest (who I'll call Kat) is from a previous relationship. 

Kat splits time 50/50 between her mom and Rob. This xmas she'll be with him. Usually Rob&wife+kids, our parents, and myself do a Christmas dinner/gift exchange together but it usually revolves around the younger kiddos nowadays. Rob and Kat's mom are both saving up to buy Kat a vehicle when she starts driving; Kat is aware of this and knows this means less 'big' gifts until then, but I felt kinda bad that all she's not getting that much for xmas.

Kat is very into gaming/mods/3d renders & has wanted a nice gaming PC for a while (all she has is an older laptop at the moment). I've got few expenses and a disposable income, so I figured ""what the hell"" and decided to go ahead and buy one for Kat for xmas. I told both Kat's mom and Rob about my idea for it before purchase; they both signed off on the idea. I found a nice prebuilt for around $1700 and ordered it. When I showed Rob the PC, he seemed taken aback and said he didn't realize it was an *ACTUAL* PC and *that* expensive.

Rob wants me to give the gift to Kat as from ""Mom, Dad, and Aunt \[MY NAME\]"". He's offered to purchase a monitor to include with the PC to make it ""fair"". I told him no, and if he wants to buy a monitor that's great, but a $200 monitor isn't the same as a $1700 PC. Rob isn't happy with this, and says I'm trying to undermine him and make him look bad to Kat.

1) I think thats crazy, I just want to do something cool for my niece.  
2) why is it bad that I want credit for a gift I researched & purchased on my own?  
3) wouldn't it be unfair for Kat's mom to ALSO not get credit if Rob does?

Rob wants me to either let him and SiL to also claim credit for the gift or wait until her bday (in 8 months!!) to give the PC so he isn't 'overshadowed' by me. My parents say I should just aquiese since Kat is his daughter & its not that big a deal.

18epdol,AITA for not giving up my seat for a woman with a baby?,"So we went to the city today with the public transport bus. I am 27, have a walker because of MS and cannot stand up easily. The aisle of the bus is not wide enough for my walker to go through. I took one of the seats for people with a disability. Parked my walker in front of me. 

A couple of stops later, a few women got in with a stroller. They looked very annoyed seeing me sitting there and basically expected me to stand up and give up my seat. The bus was extra large with a connection bit in the center. My spot could be used for disabled people but also for strollers. 

Her friend offered to move the stroller to the second part of the bus, where there was lots of space to put the stroller. The mother of the child refused to do this, saying she doesn't want the stroller to be lifted in the air. This wasn't necessary, as they could have gotten out of this part of the bus and into the second part of the bus. 

She asked me if my stroller could go there, I said no because my stroller is too wide for the aisle and I will literally fall without the stroller. Also, it takes a lot of energy for me to move. She raised her eyebrows and put the stroller in the door opening with the door closed. No passenger could get out of that door. Meanwhile she kept looking angrily at me.

18n8cva,AITA For telling my Jewish wife that religious Christmas songs are no big deal?,"My wife is Jewish and I'm an atheist. I was raised non religious and celebrate Christmas. When we had our son we agreed to raise him Jewish but also celebrate Christmas. 

He's three and this is his first year in nursery. They've been doing Christmas crafts and learning carols. On Friday he started singing ""away in a manger"". She was uncomfortable and asked what other songs they sing. He couldn't list any, but she asked for a list on Monday and got one. Theres a couple ""Jesus"" songs, basically. 

She was pretty upset when we sat down for dinner. I told her it was no big deal. He doesn't suddenly believe Jesus was the messiah because he sang about a shiny star. He's three.

She argued that its setting up a precedent, its worming into his subconscious. I told her she was being dramatic. Like half of his class is muslim and they are also taking part. It's just music.

She got pretty upset, said it was different and that she ""didn't expect"" me to get it. On Tuesday she spoke to the nursery nurses and told them she didn't want him to partake. They said they didn't have that option but she was free to take him out until after Christmas. 

She brought him home, to me, who works from home. I took him back. It's seriously not that serious. 

I told her she could take the time off work if she desperately doesn't want him there, but he already knows the songs so whats the point? Friday is his last day anyway.

She made a fuss this morning about having it noted in hia chart following that they need to make accommodation for him when celebrating religion.

My husband (28M) and I had already decided on what to name our baby depending on the gender, and upon finding out that she was going to be a girl, we announced that we would name her Adelaide. I first heard of this name when I was a kid and thought it was beautiful, and decided that if I ever had a daughter, I would name her Adelaide.

After hearing this, one of my friends (27F), who I have been close with since we were at University, began acting distant towards us. Throughout my pregnancy I have tried to be sensitive to her feelings, as I knew it was a sore point for her. Two years ago, she tragically lost her baby girl to a stillbirth. I can’t even begin to imagine how heartbreaking this must have been for her and I made sure I supported her through this devastating loss. Despite her trauma, she has never been anything less than kind and empathetic towards me, up until that day. A couple of weeks later, she confronted us, suggesting we change the name of our baby, to which we rebuffed. She kept on trying to convince us, suggesting different names, or saying that Adelaide was too old-fashioned or that it wouldn’t suite our child. We kept on denying to change her name, until eventually my friend started crying and revealed that Adelaide was the name she’d chosen for her stillborn baby.

When she was pregnant, she refused to tell anyone her baby’s name, as she wanted it to be a surprise for when she was born. After the stillbirth, she decided she would keep the name to herself because it was personal to her, to which we understood. Until recently, no one knew what her baby was going to be called. She claims that, by keeping our name, we are disrespecting the memory of her baby. She said that if I chose the same name then my daughter would be a living reminder of what could have been.

A few weeks ago I mentioned I was getting two extra days off from work at the holiday and that I thought we should use the time to start prepping the nursery. I'm 5 months pregnant and the room needs some work- furniture and guest bed removed, sickeningly bright green walls repainted, carpet deep cleaned. At the time he agreed. Well it turns out not only did he NOT take any additional time off himself (he has weeks and weeks of unused vacation), he has made plans to spend Christmas with his (Jewish) parents. They apparently invited him since he didn't get to visit on his dad's birthday or Hanukkah because of COVID in their household. I just found all this out today when I said we should start the nursery on Christmas day, since we usually visit my family on Christmas Eve and I'll be busy Saturday doing last minute shopping and wrapping.

I'm floored. My husband chose to disregard our plans and spend the holiday with people who DO NOT celebrate it rather than with his wife who DOES. And he wasn't planning to tell me about it.

The 3 oldest can pick stuff that they think the others would like fairly easily, obviously, we substantially helped our 2 year old pick gifts.   
  
Earlier this year, Liam saw a tiktok of some guy going to a thrift store and finding basketball merch, Liam plays basketball and wanted to see if he could do the same and he found some really nice stuff. Ever since then, Liam has been a huge fan of thrifting. He has found $50 or $100 items for a few bucks. Liam also wanted to thrift gifts this year, and the vast majority of the gifts he got were thrifted, this also means he was able to get each person quite many gifts, my husband and I had to get some big black trash bags to fit them all.

That annoyed me but I let it go. The other day we went to a local store and saw the perfect set but it was the last one they had and they can’t deliver until January so we had to take it with us. My BIL has a truck so we called him to come help us get it but guess what? He was busy. I ended up calling a couple of work buddies and they came to help us pick it up, take it to the in-law, and set it up. At this point my BIL has put in zero effort.

Her parents are out of town visiting relatives and will be returning around Christmas. Last night I told my wife that we’re not covering her brother’s portion and if he wants his name on the gift, he’ll have to come up with his portion or the other siblings can cover it. We got into an argument about it and she accused me of cutting him out of the gift because I know they can’t afford it. I argued that he can’t just expect to show up and take credit after not doing anything to earn it. She said he’s been sad since he’s been out of work and I said he can still drive his truck and lift boxes while being sad. I said my buddies have done more than him so their names should be on the gift. She called me an AH for saying that but I obviously disagree.",WorkingBarracuda3550,1642,0.9599999785423279,203,1703201570,2023-12-21 17:32:50,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18o0mzh/aita_for_excluding_my_bil_on_our_christmas_gift/,12,2023
18g73xa,AITA for taking my earbuds out of my wife's sister's hands?,"Ever since I was a teenager, I(39M) have been dealing with anger issues. My folks sent me over to an anger counselor when I was 16. He wasn't able to help me get rid of the anger, we tried medication, meditation, breathing exercises but the anger still remained, so he then focused on teaching me coping strategies and ways to navigate my anger so that other people won't be affected. From that point on, if I were standing up and getting mad, I would usually sit down(I'm a pretty large dude), blink a lot and try to break away my gaze since I was told that helps, but if all else fails I just leave. I have earbuds that I've had for over 5 years, and I take them and just listen to music away from everyone else. I have a special anger playlist I’ve been working on for a while, I’ve assembled all kinds of songs on it.   


This has helped me a lot but it's not always easy. For instance, my wife and I were having a huge argument over something that I'm not going to talk about. It started small, but escalated, largely spurred on by her sister, who was also participating and almost subtly egging me on.  


I told them both that I had enough and I stood up(I was in a sitting position). I took my earbuds out of my pocket and headed outside to my spot, but my wife's sister blocked the door. I tried to pull her away from the door but as I reached my hands she took my earbuds. At that point, I was so over everything, I told her to give my earbuds back, she said that we needed to talk about this and that I can't just leave, I told her again, but she tried to give my earbuds to my wife so I quickly grabbed them out of her hands and then loaded up my ""anger"" playlist.  


When I got home, my wife locked me out, and made me wait outside for 30 minutes. When I was finally let in, my wife's sister had left, but my wife said that what I did wasn't ok. I thought I was deescalating and preventing anything from happening, but my wife said that I scared her and her sister.

18or5p8,AITA for asking my daughter to check up on our house while we were away for vacation?,"Back in the summer, my wife, son and I went to Singapore for two weeks for vacation. Our daughter had to stay behind for work.

I am 64. My wife is 61. Our son is 20.

Before we left, I asked my daughter to drive by our home while we were away to check on it every once in awhile. I even gave her our keys.

The day she picked us up from the airport, I asked her if she had stopped by our house while we were away. She said no, which honestly was disappointing and confusing. Even if she didn't remember my request, I thought my daughter would be thoughtful enough to check our home to see everything was okay. But, I decided to not ask more about it and left it at that.

A few months after we got back, my daughter took an apprenticeship where she had to live only an hour away from her apartment. She asked our son to occupy and housesit her place for 6 weeks, a much bigger request then we were even asking of her to just check our house for a 2 week vacation.

All of this has felt like a slight, and a bit self-absorbed on our daughter's part. I didn't feel it was a big enough point to bring up to her, but I did want to get it off my chest, so I have mentioned how I felt about this to my wife and son a couple of times.

I just learned today that my son told our daughter about what we've been saying. He said that her explanation was that she simply ""didn't think about it"" (checking our house during the two weeks), but that's my point: the carelessness bothered me. As well, she said it's unfair to compare the two, but I feel differently.

18pmzc7,AITA for taking my kids away from their grandparents?,"For some context: I am 42M and my wife is 39F and we have two kids who are 10M and 7F. My son and daughter are everything for me. However, for the past 5 years or so, since before COVID and a bit after, I worked overseas and I rarely came home(I am a petroleum engineer and work on offshore rigs). I came home maybe 4 times in the past five years, only staying for a week max. My kids basically think of me as a stranger, and that is not their fault, it is mine. But everything I do is to provide for them, and my wife works overtime and I cannot even begin to express how much I appreciate her for that. She has been so understanding. We need the money, hence why I do what I do. 

The issue: I recently came back and switched to an on site desk job, about a month or two ago. My kids are still shy around me, and I want to get to know them better. My kids recently started coming out of their shell, and they usually spend a couple weekends per month at my in-laws place, whenever my wife has to work weekends. My wife had to work this weekend, and told me on Thursday. I asked my kids if they want to spend this weekend with me instead of their grandparents. No pressure of course. I did want to incentivize them staying though, so I promised ice cream after dinner both days, and a fast food lunch(both with my wife's permission). My son accepted immediately, and my daughter had to be bribed with a later bed time on Saturday(wife approved once again).

I just did this because I want to spend more time with my kids. I know I cannot make up for the times I've missed, but I don't want to miss anymore. However, my in-laws called me yesterday and gave me an earful about how I am interrupting their time with their grandkids and how I am breaking their tradition. I told them I just wanted to spend time with my kids, and next time my wife has to work the weekend I will send them over for sure to make up for it. They said I should find my own time to hang out with them and make traditions with them, and not interfere with what's going on. They accused me to bribing my kids for affection(partially true I guess) and for taking their grand kids away from them. They also called me a ""deadbeat"" which I feel wasn't fair since I didn't want to be away, my job made me, and I was constantly sending every penny I could back home. Had my kids still said no, I would've sent them to their grandparents. I did bribe them, but it's just with school and everything, I barely get time with them and weekends are the best. And with my wife on her business trip too, I get one on one time with them. I was just so excited and may have gotten carried away.

This would be her first time meeting my gf and we made plans to get dinner with gf’s family her last night in town.

I called her crazy and she asked me to cancel her flight, but then backtracked when she realized she couldn’t get a refund or credit. She requested that I kick my gf out of our house for the duration of her stay, and said that she would not meet her parents as originally planned. 

My gf is disappointed as she bought non-refundable gifts and prepared several vegetarian dishes for my mom so she could be comfortable during her stay. Gf said she doesn’t want to drive a wedge between my mom and I, and offered to leave when she visits.

18llxr8,AITA for refusing to go to my BF's son's wedding?,"This is a burner account (obviously) as I don't want any trace back to who I am.

I (31M) have been in a relationship with an older man (65M) for 2 years. The age difference surprises some people but it's fairly common in gay culture + he is a sweet, intelligent, fun-loving man who looks fantastic.

Let's call this boyfriend James. He was married for a few years and while very civil with his ex-wife, they have been divorced for a long time and their marriage - each has admitted - was toxic. They had one son (Junior). James struggled coming out for several years but has proudly been out and proud for a few years prior to us meeting.

James's son, we will call Junior (Jr), has known about his father's sexuality for years and was polite to me at first but quickly soured after about 6 months when it was clear I was not just a fling.

Junior is a few years older than I am - which was weird at first but I think it's time he gets over it.

James and I love to travel, try new things, etc. and due to the fact James sets the plans and - let's be frank - its farther along in his career elects to pick up the check 90% of the time. Junior (the son) has started calling me ""the sugar baby"" or just ""the baby"". 

I don't cross paths with Junior very often and to keep the peace, simply have to let any negative experiences go to not give James any undue stress.

I know how our relationship looks - and James and I have had many long conversations on the subject. We are both comfortable, having fun, and have great communication.

NOW

Junior (the son) is getting married in a few months. I was not directly invited but James naturally has marked me down as his plus one. Junior is marrying a lovely girl closer to my age. Last week, during a rare dinner that we were all present for, Junior was really nasty to me and made some unkind remarks.

It is clear that Junior has resentment toward his parents for their divorce, toxic family life early in his life, etc. He also thinks I am trying to weasel my way into the father's life for financial benefit (James built several companies that do really well).

LOOK: I am not without sympathy - if my father started dating someone a few years younger than me - regardless of gender - I would be taken aback and weirded out AT FIRST.

After 2 years though it is clear - to all of James' friends and his employees - that I am good for him. He is happier, taking more time away from his businesses, and just overall most pleasent.

I have done my best but I am done being a punching bag at every event the son and I are together at.

**I am refusing to go the wedding and while James is trying to be understanding - he is clearly hurt.**

I have made it clear that I fully support him going or even taking someone else as a date. I am not trying to spoil the big day - but I can't put myself in the firing line again.

I was gathering my things when my friend said, ""oh, by the way, you might want to check on that one as I kind of borrowed it"".

When I got into my new place, I noticed a lot of my clothes were stretched out and, considering the fabric of some, a lot damaged. 

I confronted her about it, and she said that since she was housing my stuff for free, it was basically a given. She then accused me of calling her fat, even though all I did was point out the fact that we have very different body types and what fits for me might not fit for her.

18ax6af,AITA for only picking up my food and not my families,"This is a throw away because I'd prefer my family now know my main account.

I (24 f) live with my parents and siblings because rent is crazy right now and my job isn't great. My parents have this thing where they'll always wait to pick up food. If we're told it'll be ready in 15 minutes they won't get ready to go until 30 minutes later. This has ment that anytime they get pick-up orders the foods always cold. 

I have started to pick the food up myself since I prefer hot food. The issue with this is me and my parents take turns buying the take out but they hadn't been paying since I'm the one who goes and gets it. Whenever I bring this up they tell me that they'll pay but I ""can't be impatient"" and if I go get it myself then I have to pay.

This leads to the issue yesterday. I ordered take out but said it was 2 separate orders. When the time came to get the food I went and got only my own. When I got back to the house my mom had only just grabbed her keys to get the food. She smiled and thanked me more getting the food again but I told her I got MY food and hers was waiting at the restaurant. She got mad and we had an argument. I didn't really care but my younger siblings were upset that their food was cold.

So I want to know if I'm the a-hile in this situation.

Edit:

I want to make an edit to answer for some the repeat questions instead of replying multiple times in the comments

1. Yes I pay rent and chip in for utilities and food 
2. No we aren't eating out every night. We get takeout 3 to 4 times a month. This has just been a problem for a long time.
3. My parents mainly order from a local restaurant so we have to order over the phone and pay when we pick it up. We can't order online or get it delivered.
4. My parents won't pay if I pick it up at all. They say if they pay they'll go pick it up. So if I'm being ""impatient"" and going before they leave then I can't pay for the food myself. So asking for thier card/money is a moot point because they won't give it to me to use.

Hope this helps clear the situation up and sorry for not including it to begin with.

18pnp6m,AITA for yelling at my boyfriend for eating my donut.,"

Edit: Boyfriend  insist I add that we've been together 8 years and that if this happened a month into our relationship, he agrees it would be psychotic, but what's a donut or two after 8 years. 

This is so dumb but this is somehow one the bigger fights we've had. 

I bought a shitty donut earlier today after me and my boyfriend finished some Christmas shopping and had dinner. I bought one and we were gonna share it. We regularly share food.

We go to my parents house to pick up our dog and chill out a bit before going home. I'm in the bathroom, and my boyfriend starts eating my donut and telling me how bad it is, stale and there's no creme in it (it's a Boston creme). I tell him that there's no way he's eating my donut right now and to stop or at least save me some.

He eats the whole donut. 

I get out of the bathroom and I'm kinda upset I wanted some donut tonight, he's being silly and put himself in the ''corner'' in the kitchen pretending he's there out of shame. I'm upset and ask him if he really ate it and he makes a joke and says it was so bad and not worth the calories. 

I just wanted a donut so I tell him that and he should save me some. (He says he apologized here but I do not remember this.) We go back into the living room and my dad is telling me drop it and that I'm overreacting for no reason. My mom is telling my boyfriend to apologize just because it obviously bothered me and that reason enough to apologize. My mom was kind of condescing towards him and the vibe got tense. 

I don't want to start some dumb fight over nothing and so we say our goodbyes and leave. 

On the way home I ask him to apologize and he says I'm making a big deal out of nothing and hugely overreacting. I say he's gaslitting me. Were both upset. 

We get home and keep talking about it in circles. I just want an apology to end it and he starts yelling that I'm being a ''five year old"" and that I ""made a scene in front of your parents"" and that I'm ""overreacting so badly he doesn't recognize me"". I'm mad cause he's ""gaslighting me into thinking I'm wrong"" and ""yelling at me for no reason"" and ""it doesn't matter if the donut was bad or not at least half of it was mine"". Anyways he yells my feelings are hurt and we go to seperate rooms and chill out for a bit. 

Later we talk about it a bit and both apologize, but maintain that we are in the right. 

So Reddit, who right in this extremely dumb fight?

We have both reviewed this post and agree with its facts. 

TLDR: 
Me - mad he ate my donut because we were meant to share. Doesn't matter that it was a bad donut, it's the principle of the thing. 

Him - he claims he wouldn't have been mad if I ate 'the last oreo' as an example. And that I dragged it out for too long (meaning my anger cause it was just a donut.) He says that he felt singled out my by mom and that that's worst than the donut.


UPDATE : He bought me a box of 6 donuts the next day, my favorite ones. 
And he apologized.
All is good, but thanks Reddit!!

18bobt5,AITA for making a big deal about my supervisor eating tuna?,"Throwaway, on mobile. 

I (30F) am 18 weeks pregnant. I had a very rough first trimester with morning sickness which is now tapering off, but I still have it some days. During my first trimester, I found out the hard way that the smell of tuna will trigger vomiting for me. 

My supervisor, let’s call him Dave, whose office is about 10 feet from my desk will usually eat tuna and crackers for lunch. I disclosed my pregnancy to HR and Dave in the same meeting, and HR shooed him out to discuss my maternity benefits. I took the chance to question if I could ask Dave to refrain from tuna until I felt better as it triggers my morning sickness and I can smell it at my desk when he eats it. I was told I can certainly ask, but that HR cannot enforce anything as it isn’t a documented allergy, which I was ok with. 

Talking to Dave one-on-one, I asked if he could not bring tuna in, or at least eat it in the break room that’s a good 50ft from our office area. He said yes without hesitation as he doesn’t want to be the cause of me being sick or interrupt my work flow. I profusely thanked him.

12 weeks later and I am feeling much better than I was. Last week we did a test run in the break room to see if tuna still bothered me, and it does. I apologized and Dave was a bit huffy about it, but I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Which brings us to today. I came back from lunch and Dave’s door was closed which is not unusual. I’ve been sitting for about five minutes when Dave pops out to chat with one of my coworkers and the tuna smell instantly hits me. Goodbye lunch.

Dave starts telling me I’m overreacting and just being dramatic. That I can’t expect everyone to cater to my pregnancy. My coworker tell him to back off and helps me get to the bathroom to clean up. I come back to my desk about 5 minutes later, someone used Febreeze but the tuna smell is EVERYWHERE and I get sick again. I grab a paper mask to try to mitigate the smell, but tuna is still all I can smell. 

After 20 minutes I can’t take it anymore and request if I can go home early. Dave huffs and asks if I can’t make it the final 3 hours. I told him no, and he hits back with that my leaving early will affect my end of year review. I said “so be it” and got  out of there.

On my drive home I get a call from HR. Dave told them what happened, and they again reiterate that they cannot keep Dave from eating whatever he wants in his office. I ask if my desk can be moved further away at least, to which I got “we’ll look into it, but don’t expect anything”. They ended the call by saying to should seek other medication from my doctor so my illness isn’t an office problem. 

So now I’m home, feeling like crap and waiting to hear back from my OB.

As the wedding approaches, Jess drops a bombshell – she's uninviting Will because of how he treated me during that challenging time. I understand her concern, but he's genuinely changed and even gifted them money for their wedding photos. I tried explaining our progress, but she remains firm.

In a show of solidarity with my partner, I've decided not to attend the wedding. Am I the asshole for supporting my fiancé in this situation?",Brilliant_Fig_2445,963,0.8299999833106995,461,1702590736,2023-12-14 15:52:16,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ijq0z/aita_for_skipping_my_friends_wedding_after_she/,12,2023

18k34sg,AITA for not wanting to invite a BABY to a party?,"I work at a restaurant with my parents, 2 brothers, and other people and we are having our Christmas party on Sunday. One of the people who doesn’t work at the restaurant but was still invited has a child, a 1 year old and I said that it’s stupid to invite a baby to the party. The youngest people at this party besides the baby are 15  and 17, both in high school. 

There will be tons of alcohol at this party, as well as people smoking weed (including myself), and there will be loud music, and it’s also inside of the restaurant where we work.  So I don’t think it’s the best environment for a baby, they will easily get overstimulated and cry, and it will just end in the mother (who was invited) tending to the baby all night. 

So at work I stated that it’s dumb to invite the baby, they will just cry the whole time and the mother will not enjoy it, and everyone including my parents started going off about how I’m a bad person? My mother said my brain was skewed, because I don’t want a baby around a bunch of drunk people. 

Am I the asshole?

Edit: I don’t think the teens or anyone under 18 should be there either ",Kingpunchwood,909,0.8799999952316284,270,1702767999,2023-12-16 17:06:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18k34sg/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_a_baby_to_a_party/,12,2023
18d7juk,"AITA for giving my niece a book of ""controversial"" fairy tales?","I (25F) sent my niece (6F) a book with the original collection of Grimms' fairy tales as an early Christmas gift, because I’m going abroad in a few days, and I won’t be home for Christmas. 

I texted my brother (30M), her father, to see if they had gotten my gift. He just said yes. I thought this was a weird, short answer (I mean, he didn’t even say thank you or anything else), so I followed up and asked if my niece liked it. Eventually, after some hesitation, my brother told me that his wife (31F) read some of the stories with my niece and she (my SIL, not my niece!) thought they were disturbing and inappropriate for a 6-year-old.   
  
Bear in mind, I read those tales myself when I was her around my niece's age. It’s the original version of those classic tales like Cinderella and Snow White, except they don’t sugarcoat the darkest aspects of the story. It didn’t traumatize me in anyway and millions of children have read them throughout history.

I got offended by my brother’s suggestion that this was an inappropriate gift. My brother then said it’s up to them, the parents, to decide if she’s old enough to read them or not, and I should just drop it. I don’t disagree with him, I was not saying they SHOULD read everything now (or ever), I just don’t think I’m an AH for not thinking this would be a problem. ",throwaway62191202,887,0.8399999737739563,774,1701988243,2023-12-07 16:30:43,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18d7juk/aita_for_giving_my_niece_a_book_of_controversial/,12,2023
18pmwqb,AITA for my bf’s 5-year-old son seeing me naked?,"I had just gotten out of the shower, which I told my bf I’d be in prior to, and had all the doors closed. I was in the process of drying off and was on the edge of my bed scrolling through my phone when his 5-year-old son busted in without knocking.  I quickly covered up the best I could. The child just said something unrelated and laughed like normal but my bf came behind him and without even addressing his son, immediately said, “can we not just sit around the house butt naked, please?”

I just looked at him incredibly dumbfounded and said, “can you please teach your son to knock?” The whole interaction was maybe about 6 seconds long. He closed the door without responding and I immediately started crying. 

I don’t know why, but this hurt me pretty bad because I feel like I was made out to be some type of predator for doing absolutely nothing wrong. I am incredibly upset by this. He came in a few minutes later trying to comfort me, and in his comforting he reiterated again the importance of not sitting around naked. I became upset all over again. Like, am I missing something? Am I wrong here?

TLDR: bf’s son walked in on me naked without knocking after I had just gotten out of the shower and chastised me for it.",Proper_Associate_791,866,0.9100000262260437,33,1703390338,2023-12-23 21:58:58,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pmwqb/aita_for_my_bfs_5yearold_son_seeing_me_naked/,12,2023
188oxx1,AITA for not pretending to like my husband’s gift?,"I (33F) have been married to my husband (37M) for 10 years. He’s a great husband and father but he is absolutely terrible at gift giving.

Several years ago, I told him I wanted a specific, inexpensive t-shirt with a funny to me saying on it for Christmas.  I showed him the shirt on Etsy multiple times. I thought it would be super easy for him to order and he didn’t have to worry about coming up with his own idea. He did not buy me the shirt.

The next year, I mentioned the shirt again and, once again, he did not buy me the shirt. 

I could have purchased the shirt myself, but at this point I became petty and let it stew over the years.

Flash forward to this year. At Thanksgiving he was bragging to my SIL that he always pays attention to me and gets me great gifts. I replied “Really? I asked you for one thing - X shirt - for years and you never bought it.” 

Today, when I got the mail, we had a weird package from a known knock-off t-shirt company. I immediately realized he must have finally ordered me “the shirt.” I searched for the phrase I had wanted and found that they had multiple designs with the same phrase but none of their shirts look like the original one I had shown him and wanted. The one I wanted had basic block text in black and the designs available on this site were multi-colored with cartoon drawings and are 100% not my style. 

I peeked in the package and can confirm, it is a shirt with the saying but in a design I absolutely won’t wear. 

AITA if I tell him I don’t like the shirt when he gives it to me and make him return it for the one I want? If he had gotten the horribly designed one the first year I asked, I would suck it up and pretend that I love it but I feel like he bought it to prove a point and didn’t even take the time to consider what I actually wanted.",taxhawk11,838,0.9300000071525574,345,1701471360,2023-12-01 16:56:00,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188oxx1/aita_for_not_pretending_to_like_my_husbands_gift/,12,2023
18pnhvw,AITA for booking my wife and son a Christmas 2024 Disney trip on Christmas Day?,"For context: My wife and I recently had our firstborn son this past Fall. The birth was traumatic and since then our poor little guy has had bouts with RSV, pneumonia and an ear infection. It’s been a hard few months on my wife to say the least. We also live in the south, half an hour away from my in-laws who we get to see regularly and they have helped us tremendously (which we’re both very grateful for). But I’m originally from the East coast and we haven’t been there in a couple of years so we’re spending Christmas with my family this year. We’ve spent the past few Thanksgivings and Christmas in our home state. As a Christmas gift and a way to give my wife an experience she’s always wanted, I booked the three of us a mini getaway to Disney World for Christmas 2024, which also includes Christmas Day.

Today however, when doing our gift exchange with our family in our home state, my mother-in-law became very upset about our trip and started asking why I would do that to her. I said “this isn’t about you. It’s about giving [wife] something she’s always wanted and deserves.” We also said that I only kept it a secret so that it wouldn’t get spoiled and that if they wanted to join us they were more than welcome to. She visibly got upset and then stormed off and locked herself in her room. She started accusing me of intentionally keeping my wife and son away from her and the rest of our family during the holidays. She also stopped talking to us the rest of the night. My wife felt guilty for receiving the gift and I began to feel like an asshole for upsetting my MIL because I was only thinking about doing something to make the missus happy that would also help us make some fun memories. I even was considering shifting the dates of our trip just to make peace. However, my MIL then started texting my wife and 1) accused me of plotting a Christmas trip away with my family over on the East coast on purpose in order to have two back-to-back years away for the holidays, and 2) berated my wife for allowing me to mistreat her in such a way. So now I definitely don’t want to move the trip because I feel like it would just reinforce my MIL’s behavior.

So, AITA?",deanleganger,820,0.9399999976158142,23,1703392364,2023-12-23 22:32:44,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pnhvw/aita_for_booking_my_wife_and_son_a_christmas_2024/,12,2023
