1fi41o4,CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy.,"If you're voting for Trump in the 2024 election, it suggests that you either have a lack of understanding about what has happened over the last decade and have been subject to misinformation, or are actively against democracy. 

There is a minority of Trump-voters who would like to see another system in place than the current system of democratic values, because they think their values and ideals are more important than democracy. Those who would rather live in a tyranny or other aristocratic system, as long as their needs and values are met. 

The vast part of the republican voters does not want to get rid of democracy - nor is it in their best interest - and are just un- or misinformed about current events. Even if your opinions are generally in line with most of the things Trump stands for, and you're actively opposed to everything Harris stands for, it should not matter since one side does not adhere to democratic values and the other does. I understand that a lot of information that people in the US get is heavily colored in favour of one candidate or the other

All of this has been made especially clear since January 6th; if you support a candidate that attempted to commit a coup d'était, you want to subvert democracy, or you don't have the correct information to make an informed choice.

I'm open to discussion and reconsidering my views if presented with new insights, as ""they're all misinformed or authoritarian"" feels overly simplistic. My perspective comes from observing recent events, but I'm curious to see whether my view is shaped by the news I receive or if there’s a more nuanced explanation.

1fboo3p,CMV: Hijabs are sexist,"I've seen people (especially progressive people/Muslim women themselves) try to defend hijabs and make excuses for why they aren't sexist.

But I think hijabs are inherently sexist/not feminist, especially the expectation in Islam that women have to wear one. The basic idea behind wearing a hijab (why it's a thing in the first place) is to cover your hair to prevent men from not being able to control themselves, which is problematic. It seems almost like victim-blaming, like women are responsible for men's impulses/temptations. Why don't Muslim men have to cover their hair?

I've heard feminist Muslim women try to make defenses for it. (Like, ""It brings you closer to God,"" etc.) But they all sound like excuses, honestly. This is basically proven by the simple fact that women don't have to wear one around other women or their male family members, but they have to wear it around other men that aren't their husbands. There is no other reason for that, besides sexism/heteronormativity, that actually makes sense. Not to mention, what if the woman is lesbian, or the man is gay? You could also argue that it's homophobic, in addition to being sexist.

I especially think it's weird that women don't have to wear hijabs around their male family members (people they can't potentially marry), but they have to wear one around their male cousins.

1f8d5lm,"CMV: Broadway would never allow a “Book of Mormon” style, satirical play on the Quran and neither would most Muslims","Say what you will about the LDS church but they at least have a good sense of humor about themselves. While the play is actually a love letter — in many ways — organized Christianity from atheists, it still does have many biting criticisms of the Mormon church and it takes having a somewhat of a thick skin to take them all with a smile. 

I don’t think this would be the same with Muhammad and Quran. In part because the God of the Quran is a lot more oblique and mysterious, the connection people feel with him is displaced to Muhammad instead. Hence the treatment of him as if he is god, not just a mortal man who’s his messenger. 

All this to say, there would be tons of public protests all over the world, bomb threats and gun threats in the lead up to opening day of the show. But, I think in all honesty it would be more outside America than within it. American Muslims, though they might be more upset with the blasphemous message and disrespectful tone, are pretty liberal overall and not much different from American Christians. Worldwide im sure there would be lots of “death to America and the gays on broadway” chants too. 

Nevertheless it would be an extremely volatile, toxic issue the pick-me Mercedes mujahideen type liberals who would lose their mind because they’d have to choose between treating Islam like Christianity conservatives or being “one of the good ones.” But if you’re in America, I can’t speak for anywhere else, part of the buy-in is being okay with people making fun of your religion.

1f7a62j,cmv: Demisexual is not a real sexuality,"This goes for demisexual, graysexual, monosexual(the term is pointless jesus), sapoisexual, and all the other sexualities that are just fancy ways of saying i have a type or a lack of one. 

but i’m gonna focus on demisexual bc it makes me the most confused. 

So demisexual is supposedly when a person feels sexually attracted to someone only after they've developed a close emotional bond with them. Simple enough, right? Wrong, because sexuality is a person's identity in relation to the gender or genders to which they are typically attracted; sexual orientation. Which means demisexual is not a sexuality by definition. 

Someone who is gay, straight, lesbian, or bi could all be demi because demisexual isn’t a sexuality it’s just when people get comfortable enough to have sex with their partner, which is 100% fine but not a damn sexuality. not everyone can have sex with someone when they first meet them and that’s normal, but i’ve got this weird inclination that people who use the term demisexual to describe themselves can’t find the difference between not being completely comfortable with having sex with someone until they get to know them or feeling a complete lack of sexual attraction until they get to know someone. 

maybe i’m missing something but i really can’t fully respect someone if they use this term like it’s legit. to me, it’s just a label to make people feel different and included in the lgbt community.

1ff2phz,CMV: Pedophiles Are Treated Unfairly,"Alright, calm down. I can already hear the pitchforks. I'll clarify two things before I begin: 

1: My post refers to **non-offending** pedophiles. Those who have an attraction toward children who have **not** committed a crime. Anybody who has committed an offence against a child should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. 

2: I am not a pedophile. Many people assume that anybody who speaks up on such a topic must automatically be involved, but the reason for my opinion is two fold. I was sexually abused as a child and I now work with young people who were released from a variety of institutions (detention centres, mainly), many of whom either suffered sexual abuse, or engaged in it. I am not a doctor, nor am I a psychologist. 

  
So, my view is relatively straightforward. I believe that society has demonised pedophiles to a point that makes life less safe for children. 

I believe that every non-offending pedophile should be treated with the same respect, care and compassion that we give to any other member of society who is suffering with a mental illness. Treatment in the form of counselling/therapy or anything else that is possible, should be widely available and completely confidential. 

I believe that the rhetoric of 'kill all pedophiles' does nothing but prevent these people from coming forward to receive the help that they need to stop them from acting on their thoughts. 

Finally, I believe that if we, as a society, showed more compassion to these people, and encouraged getting professional help like we do with many major mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc) that the world would be a much safer place for the most vulnerable members of our communities. 

  
To confirm; I am speaking **only** about *non-offending* pedophiles. ",NameOk2758,1397,0.6299999952316284,2236,1726148072,2024-09-12 08:34:32,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ff2phz/cmv_pedophiles_are_treated_unfairly/,9,2024
1fihxa0,CMV: there is such a thing as “being racist towards white people”.,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not white. I appear white, but most of my ancestry is Middle Eastern and Asian. I was born and raised in a Muslim-majority country. When I moved to the West, I was surprised to see how the white people here (particularly those leaning left) behave as if everything bad happening in the world is their direct fault. There is so much focus on being politically correct and tolerant, yet it seems to be the status quo to constantly shit on white people. 

I’ve had conversations with people who have this dislike for the white population, and they tell me that this hate stems from the West’s involvement in colonisation and now the white Westerners are to pay the price for the actions of their ancestors. This makes no sense. Many non Western countries out there have done horrible things, have invaded and colonised other states, waged cruel wars and the list goes on. Another argument I’m presented with is how there is still exploitation of particularly African countries by the Western nations. But how does attacking uninvolved white people help those impacted by this exploitation? Also, non Western countries also exploit other states.

There is absolutely such a thing as racism towards white people. Since I’m not white, people holding these views feel very comfortable talking bad about random white people and unironically call them colonisers in my presence. And the white folks will just take it all and apologise on top of it. Why? You never personally colonised anyone, if your great great someone did, that’s not your fault and not something you ought to make apologies for.

I don’t understand why you put up with this, especially in your own countries. It wouldn’t fly where I was born, but here it seems a societal norm even.

1f72hcb,"CMV: Both presidential candidates endorse removing taxes on tips. It's a terrible, unfair idea. ","I don't see any positive aspects to this, only the following negative aspects.

1.  Why should a fast-food restaurant worker have a substantial tax advantage over, say, a Walmart employee with an hourly wage earning as much or most likely less? That's incredibly unfair. 

2. Some service/hospitality staff at high end restaurants make an excellent living on tips, why shouldn't they pay taxes like others earning a similar, or in some cases, far lower wage?

3. If you thought tipping culture was broken now, wait until everyone else who doesn't currently get tips starts demanding them.  Sure, maybe they'll set limits on which professions can get tips, but that will end up being a pretty complicated process. People in tons of different fields and professions currently get tips. Who gets them tax-free, and why?

1f905a1,CMV: Voter ID is a totally sensible policy.,"Some context as to my view: 
- I’m an American dual citizen. I have been old enough to vote in one presidential election in both countries. For the election outside of the US, I needed to have a valid ID that was issued by the government to all citizens over the age of 18 in order to vote. Having experienced this, calls for voter ID in the US seem totally reasonable to me, with one important caveat. There needs to be a way for American citizens to easily get an ID. Getting a traditional form of ID like a driver’s license or passport is not universally accesible, you need to know how to drive to get a license or pay in order to apply for a passport. If you fix this by getting the government to issue voter ID cards to people who apply for free, then I really see no drawbacks to Voter ID policies.

1fctdjq,CMV: Universal Healthcare is less expensive and more efficient than the private American model,"Universal healthcare is actually way more efficient than the system we have in the U.S., and despite what some people say, it won’t bankrupt the country. Plenty of countries have made universal healthcare work for them without sinking their economies. Take Canada and the UK, for example: they’ve had universal healthcare for decades and, overall, spend way less per person than the U.S. does. According to a report from The Commonwealth Fund, the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on healthcare as these other countries but has worse outcomes in key areas like life expectancy and chronic illness management.

A common argument against universal healthcare is that it would be too expensive and would require higher taxes, which could cripple the economy. But here's the thing, Americans are already paying a lot for healthcare, just in different ways. Instead of paying higher taxes, most people are dealing with expensive insurance premiums, copays, and surprise medical bills. While taxes might go up with universal healthcare, people would actually save more money because they wouldn’t be paying for private insurance or out-of-pocket costs. Plus, a single-payer system would allow the government to negotiate drug prices, which could further lower costs overall.

Some people point to long wait times in countries like the UK to argue that universal healthcare doesn’t work. Yes, the UK has had issues with wait times, but it’s not like the U.S. system is any better when it comes to accessing care. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Americans often have to wait just as long, if not longer, to see specialists, especially if they don’t have good insurance. And let’s not forget that a lot of Americans avoid going to the doctor at all because they’re worried about the costs, even if they have insurance. So, the argument about wait times doesn’t hold up when you consider the whole picture.

Another reason universal healthcare is more efficient is that it cuts down on the massive administrative costs that come with private insurance. Right now, a huge chunk of U.S. healthcare spending goes toward paperwork, insurance claims, and bureaucracy, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). With universal healthcare, you could eliminate most of those costs, allowing more money to go directly to patient care instead of getting lost in administrative overhead.

In the end, the U.S. is already spending a ton on healthcare but getting mediocre results compared to countries with universal systems. By switching to a more efficient system that focuses on prevention and removes the need for private insurers, we could improve outcomes and reduce overall costs without bankrupting the country. Other countries have figured it out, and there's no reason the U.S. can’t do the same.",TheAntiCoomLord,1206,0.8299999833106995,967,1725898589,2024-09-09 11:16:29,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fctdjq/cmv_universal_healthcare_is_less_expensive_and/,9,2024

I've noticed the police in my short lifespan go from hawking profilers to being so lax they will see a crime happening right in front of them and just ask the perpetrator to move along. 

I go to the grocery store almost every day and over the last few years I've noticed the influx of people just walking In and walking out with shopping carts loaded with food and booze. The workers tell me the police won't do anything unless it's a felony charge. 

So now they have their own ARMED security and even they can only do so much without a threat of violence. 

Drug use is rampant on the street I can't go out for a bike ride without seeing at least one pilo being smoked out of let alone not see a needle or two.

1fes0nh,CMV: Israel Should Be Sanctioned for Killing an American Citizen Today,"My view is that this issue has reached a boiling point. This is not the first US citizen that Israel has killed American citizens. Credible claims point to no less than five American citizens whom Israel has claimed responsibility for killing (one way or another) in the recent past.

The most recent incident is particularly alarming in my view and does warrant actual sanctions as a response. Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was killed by a bullet Israel alleges was aimed at the **leader of a protest.** Amazingly to me, the White House has *hatched* a completely far fetched idea suggesting a sniper bullet ""ricochet"" caused an American civilian to be shot in the head and killed.

The glaring issue for me is that (just like in the case of Saudi Arabia) I do not understand why we are choosing to keep the taps flowing on money to ""allies"" who are carrying out **extra-judicial** killings of journalists or protesters, especially American citizens.

1fkl7y7,CMV: The Pager Attacks will separate people who care about human rights from people who engage with anti-Zionism and Gaza as a trendy cause,"I’ll start by saying I’m Jewish, and vaguely a Zionist in the loosest sense of the term (the state of Israel exists and should continue to exist), but deeply critical of Israel and the IDF in a way that has cause me great pain with my friends and family. 

To the CMV: Hezbollah is a recognized terrorist organization. It has fought wars with Israel in the past, and it voluntarily renewed hostilities with Israel after the beginning of this iteration of the Gaza war because it saw an opportunity Israel as vulnerable and distracted. 

Israel (I’ll say ‘allegedly’ for legal reasons, as Israel hasn’t yet admitted to it as of this writing, but, c’mon) devised, and executed, a plan that was targeted, small-scale, effective, and with minimal collateral damage. It intercepted a shipment of pagers that Hezbollah used for communications and placed a small amount of explosives in it - about the same amount as a small firework, from the footage I’ve seen. 

These pagers would be distributed by Hezbollah to its operatives for the purpose of communicating and planning further terrorist attacks. Anyone who had one of these pagers in their possession received it from a member of Hezbollah. 

The effect of this attack was clear: disable Hezbollah’s communications system, assert Israel’s intelligence dominance over its enemies, and minimize deaths. 

The attack confirms, in my view, that Israel has the capability to target members of Hamas without demolishing city blocks in Gaza. It further condemns the IDFs actions in Gaza as disproportionate and vindictive. 

I know many people who have been active on social media across the spectrum of this conflict. I know many people who post about how they are deeply concerned for Palestinians and aggrieved by the IDFs actions. Several of them have told me that they think the pager attack was smart, targeted and fair. 

I still know several people who are still posting condemnations of the pager attack. Many of them never posted anything about Palestine before October 7, 2023. I belief that most of them are interacting with this issue because it is trendy.

1fnwlrq,CMV: “Racism = prejudice + power” misunderstands what racism is,"
I’m a leftist and this argument is used a lot by leftists as a way to brush off interpersonal racism against white people, but I think this is harmful because it unnecessarily combines the definitions of interpersonal and systemic racism, and it’s important to distinguish the two.

90% of the time people who complain about anti-white racism are full of shit but the right way to deal with it is to either ignore them or confront them on their argument directly. I think it’s fair to say that interpersonal racism against whites is less of a problem for a lot of reasons (either because it’s less common, it doesn’t tap into trauma in the same way it does for POC, or it has less severe effects because anti-white rhetoric doesn’t affect whites systematically). But because those arguments are more complicated and people don’t wanna take the effort to make them, they come up with this new definition of racism that makes no sense and just serves to shut up people who don’t agree with it.

If interpersonal racism is only valid when accompanied by systemic racism, asian americans who aren’t first-gen immigrants can’t experience racism, since they don’t experience racism systemically. Other racial minorities can’t experience racism from black americans since black people suffer from systemic racism in america more than any other group by far, and therefore have less power in society.

If interpersonal racism was defined by the existence of systemic racism, there would be no need to distinguish the two. But it’s really important to understand the differences between types of racism so we can be specific when talking about racism and discussing its consequences. If this means acknowledging that white people can technically experience racism, that’s fine and doesn’t contradict the struggles of racial minorities. I also think turning the definition of racism into an equation is trying to “quantify” racism and turning it into oppression olympics which is always unhelpful.

I want my view changed because if there’s a good reason for me to agree with the “prejudice + power” statement, I wanna know about it.",Ill-Cat4533,826,0.7599999904632568,928,1727128646,2024-09-23 16:57:26,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fnwlrq/cmv_racism_prejudice_power_misunderstands_what/,9,2024

Violent sexual assault isn’t like other crimes. Most people aren’t going to therapy for years after getting smacked in the face by their parent or sibling as a 6 year old. Many people that were molested, even once, spend years dealing with the fallout from that moment well into adulthood. 

It’s because for most humans sex means profound vulnerability. It’s tied up with our identity, our attractiveness and our emotions in a deeply fundamental way *most* jobs we work don’t. 

I’m very pro capitalism for most things but seeing how even **non-sex** related jobs can be twisted into bizarre, abusive playgrounds for predators. Think Hollywood or the endless yoga/spiritual clubs that turn into fronts for sex work. With the right incentives people can and will pressure, this time with the law on their side, vulnerable men and women into physically or emotionally abusive situations so the whorehouse makes their bottom line by the end of the year. 

And the downstream effects of that normalization would be catastrophic in my opinion. ",nowlan101,794,0.7300000190734863,610,1727473908,2024-09-27 16:51:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fqz4j6/cmv_sex_work_will_always_be_different_from_other/,9,2024

Thus, their views regarding the EC will likely change. 

Texas voted 38% blue, 59% red in 2000. Every election with one exception, the blue share has gone up. It was 46 vs 52 in 2020, and Nate Silver's latest forecast is 45 vs 51. Many polls put Texas within 5% 

It's also possible that Democrats will suddenly stop supporting a popular vote alterantive to the EC.

I don't know if it was the no child left behind policy or something else but how is it that you can reach the age where you can make a bank account, write and deposit a cheque but you're somehow so mentally handicapped that you don't understand you're committing fraud, let alone think you're somehow going to be able to take money from a bank and they aren't going to take it back.

Then everything above put aside how can you have the gall to then go make videos about it like we're supposed to feel sorry that you generally should not have made it past childhood with that level of critical thinking.

  
My view, the victims of the chase bank money glitch are a sign of societal & intellectual decline either from schooling, parenting, genes, community, country, oppression, etc.",Cablepussy,685,0.7599999904632568,202,1725935843,2024-09-09 21:37:23,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fd7kqr/cmv_victims_of_the_chase_bank_money_glitch_are_a/,9,2024
1fd3qbw,"CMV: Regardless of where you stand on the abortion debate, the ""unborn"" should always have fewer rights than those who are born. ","I think it's ridiculous that anyone thinks the rights of the ""unborn"" should even come close to the rights of the born. People in my conservative family and hometown all firmly believe that unborn embryos and fetuses deserve the same rights as born babies. To me, the issue can be simplified by a very simple thought experiment. 

*You find yourself in a fertility clinic that is burning down. You estimate that you have about 5 minutes to escape. You're standing next to a random toddler that's looking at you for help. You are also aware of 50 frozen embryos nearby and you know you can save a few of them if you hurry, but you can't carry very many if you're also carrying the toddler. You see three choices and have to act quick, which one do you choose?*

*1. Pick up the toddler and run out of the building as fast as you can*

*2. Pick up the toddler and try to save as many frozen embryos and run out of the building as fast as you can*

*3. Try to save as many frozen embryos as possible and leave the toddler behind*

To me, the **only** sane answer is 1. You pick up the toddler and run out of the building as fast as you can. If I chose option 2, I would be risking the toddler's life as well as my own for what I consider an unnecessary risk. Even stopping to save a single frozen embryo (and ensure it is properly stored so it does not thaw out) means precious time lost and potential smoke inhalation for the toddler and me. 

If I choose option 3, I am responsible for the death of the born person no matter how many frozen embryos I save. 

I have posed this scenario to many of my conservative family members and none of them are willing to answer the question and inevitably go off topic. 

I believe that any sane person would always prioritize the safety of the born person. Yet I see very passionate arguments from conservatives about the rights of the unborn, as if the unborn were truly just as human as a born person. 

I am not denying that an unborn embryo or fetus deserve some dignity, that's why we have laws against endangering the unborn. But my real issue is this pervasive idea that the unborn are equal to the born. We can argue about the unborn being ""50%"" or ""80%"" or on a sliding scale of equality as they get closer to being born, but at no point, in my view, does an unborn person have 100% the same value as a baby who is being born right now or is already born.

From my perspective, Trump has all of the bad qualities of a politician with none of the good. He's a pathological liar, he's obsessed with power (to the point where he wanted to stop counting votes when he was winning, despite numerous news sources explicitly saying there was a high possibility of a red mirage.) He keeps claiming voter fraud, but does not have enough evidence to get a case in front of a court. When the team picked by him- the cyber ninjas- counted the votes themselves they found *more* votes for Biden. 

I mean the list of stuff with this guy goes on and on. And in so many ways, he is like a dictator. His language- ""vermin"" ""poisoning the blood of this country."" I have never heard anybody say that except sociopaths and dictators (or, as often happens, a mix of both.)

Until recently, I believed there was no way people were in an enormous cult. And the idea that they are is terrifying, because history has shown that cult members will sacrifice a great deal for their leaders. But I really just do not see another explanation.

After experiencing some health scares and getting a firmer understanding of just how fleeting our lives are, I've started to feel a deep dread, and sometimes borderline panic attacks, when contemplating death. The infinite void of nothingness. This amazing spark of life, then it's gone *forever*. I know that I won't experience being dead. But still, the idea of nothingness after death terrifies me.

1fj9b69,CMV: The view “abortion should be illegal except for cases of rape” is impossible to actually have as a policy in practice.,"Let’s assume every single woman who is a victim of SA reported literally the same day and the man is arrested the same day. Even in this scenario, you’d be lucky to have your rapist charged and convicted within your pregnancy period, and if you did the baby would probably be almost born anyway. Evidence collecting, discovery, motions, trial, getting a verdict takes way more time than people realize. 

I know many of you are thinking “durrr let’s just expedite these trials.” First to that, it’s hilarious seeing the party that has prided itself on defending the rights of accused rapists take that stance, that we should just greatly diminish the rights of the accused and hold an unusually fast trial for one of the most serious crimes there is. Second, even expedited litigation wouldn’t fix the issue. Inevitably there will be disputes and issues before trial, court delays, and other things that push even expedited trials to 6-12 months after the offense.

I haven’t even taken account the fact that basically every rapist that is found takes a long time to identify and arrest, haven’t mentioned that only 10% of crimes are ever solved in the USA, and haven’t made any arguments about how unfair the justice system can be to rape victims. 

TLDR: we could never arrest and convict rapists quick enough (without greatly violating their constitutional rights) as to have a policy of abortions illegal except for rape.

1fpssmp,Cmv: You can absolutely be racist to white people,"I hate when people say that you can't be racist to white people. As far as i'm concerned it means ""i'm racist but i don't wanna take accountability for it so i'm gonna water it down to prejudice and use my marganalization as an excuse"" 

Let's take a look at some definitions of racism and go over them. This is the one you get by google. It comes from oxford languages.


""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.""

First of all. The definition clearly states that racism is typically experienced by minorities/marganalized people but not exclusively. If this was the case then the definition wouldn't have the word ""typically"" in it.

This definition also describes the fact that there are different types of racism (such as interpersonal racism and institutional racism) and white people can absolutely experience racism on an interpersonal level

I'll also go over a second definition by merriam webster

1
: a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race

also : behavior or attitudes that reflect and foster this belief : racial discrimination or prejudice

2
a
: the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another

b
: a political or social system founded on racism and designed to execute its principles

This clearly also describes that racism can manifest in different ways. With what was being described under section 1 would be called interpersonal racism and what would be described under section 2 would  be described as systemic/institutional racism.

People say stuff like ""you can't be racist to white people"" and ""black people can't be racist"" to justify/downplay hatred towards white people. I have even heard that ""hate crime against white people is not a thing"" BUT IT IS A THING. if you committ a crime against someone because of their race it is a hate crime and being marganalized and opressed is not an excuse for that

We need to stop giving BIPOC passes when they say something racist about white people. I see it on tiktok all of the time. I hate it when they call me ""palm colored"" just call me ""white"" or caucasian. I am not going to be anyone's punching bag. You need to realize that the mindset that one race is ""less than"" is exactly what created the system of opression in the first place and if you are truly serious about equality, BIPOC should be held to the same standards as white people. Not to a lesser standard. I honestly think saying that shouldn't even be controversial but here we are.

1fhpjya,"CMV: Making a roommate rental posting for ""Gujarati Only"" or ""Filipino Preferred"" is racist","There has been an increase in Canadian urban hubs of seeing immigrants (of different nationalities) post their nationality preference in the listing for a roommate. The law states that shared accommodation is not covered by protections against discrimination. While this has been occurring for over 10 years, it has come more to the forefront as there is a significant housing shortage in those same areas in Canada, and people are more aware of housing issues.

I am also an immigrant. In any roommate posting I've ever made, I posted details about myself, and then assessed whether the other person jived with me. I cannot fathom meeting someone who was a great fit, but rejecting them due to their ethnic background. I never thought to filter by race or ethnicity, since it felt so wrong.

**Summarized Opinion:**

* I'm not questioning the legality of the issue. I believe searching for a roommate on the lifestyle and principles you have is fine. You have to live with them after all. 
* **Stating your own characteristics in a roommate search are fine, eg:** ""I am from the Philippines, speak English and Tagalog, I am a vegetarian, devout Christian, 9-5 job etc""
* **Searching for a roommate with criteria that discriminates on mutable characteristics are fine, eg:** ""I would like a roommate who is clean, quiet, doesn't WFH""
* **Specifying boundaries isn't an issue, eg:** ""I don't drink, so prefer not to have parties or alcohol in the house. I'm a strict religious vegetarian, so we'd need to keep our food separate.""
* **Searching for a roommate using immutable characteristics such as ethnic background**, and by saying ""Gujarati Only"" or ""Chinese Preferred"" **is racist.**

People have said that listing all this out takes too long, isn't it simpler to list the one word that you know will match all your criteria, ie... **your racial/ethnic preference**? I feel like the 'culture' argument is being used to hide the poster's own xenophobia, and dislike of meeting or interacting meaningfully with other cultures. I feel like they're being excused due to being refugees/immigrants, and that it's a double standard. I am struggling to unsee people who act insular like this as being racially motivated, otherwise they would use the language examples above.

I am curious if this sub can change my mind. I'm open to understanding your perspective. I appreciate immigration and melding of cultures, and I was genuinely surprised when I felt the pushback.

1fpsled,"CMV: Americans' current use of the term ""middle-class"" is a out of step with standard English and is a politically-motivated con.","In the broader Anglosphere, the term ""middle-class"" is used to describe the socio-economic class of households that enjoy middle-level incomes but also a suite of social practices. While there is no universal definition, many would include things like a university-level education, salaried position in a profession or ""white-collar"" job, travel abroad, considerable savings and job/financial security and so on.

In the US, the term ""middle-class"" has been co-opted to describe now something closer to what the wider world understands as ""working class"" - people who have paid employment, possibly shiftwork or casualised, often in blue-collar trades, with significant financial precarity. Many American sitcoms show ""middle-class"" (US-sense) families - like *The Simpsons*. A recent [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/02/15/middle-class-financial-security/) poll suggested only 30% of Americans consider a college education a marker of being middle class. This is not how the term is used in the UK, Canada, Australia (or other English-speakers in, for example, India).

The point of the term ""middle-class"" is to indicate there is an economic class ""above"" (in some sense) and ""below"". Using the term ""middle-class"" to describe people who the wider world describe as ""working class"" is a form of flattery (maybe) but also a piece of political theatre: ""hey, you're not on food stamps so you're middle class"" is a great way to deflect from people being systematically exploited in ways out-of-step with other English-speaking countries.

1f91whl,Cmv: Republicans shouldn’t be voting for Trump after his attempt to remain in power after losing an election. ,"Trump tried to execute a bloodless coup after losing the 2020 election. The fake elector scheme, telling Pence not to certify the results, having states individually not certify the results, are all such damaging and despicable acts, that even if they agree with him on policy, should have stopped Republicans from voting for him in the primaries and even the general election. 

There’s no compelling evidence the 2020 election was rigged. Most of the federal judiciary at the time and the Supreme Court was made up of Republicans, many of whom were appointed by Trump, and yet Trump still lost in court. He and his supporters make plenty of claims in public, but as soon as they were under oath and had to submit evidence subject to cross examination, they had none. 

Trump’s attempt to subvert our democracy is so incredibly damaging. It’s incredibly dangerous to set a precedent where the party that loses the election can remain in power anyway. Dictatorship is almost universally a bad idea with bad outcomes. 

The arguments that Democrats do the same thing are so poor, I’m skeptical they are being made in good faith. There are one or two comments Hillary has made since losing that I think are damaging and that she shouldn’t have made, but it’s not comparable to what Trump did. Hillary conceded and did not try to remain in power after losing. She did not try to pursue illegal or unethical schemes to remain in power. Gore challenged the vote in Florida when he had a legitimate reason to think he might have won, and once he lost, he conceded and did not try to remain in power. 

If a Dem had done what Trump did, I would absolutely vote for a McCain or a Romney over the dem. Democracy is too important. 

The only possible exception to the argument that I see is for people who actually believe abortion is 100% truly murder. Unlike the 2020 election which was demonstrably not rigged, abortion is a murkier philosophical question so I find it difficult to simply dismiss their view even if I disagree with it. It is also hard for me to advocate for someone to vote for a party that is pushing for the legalization of murder.

If someone cheats on their SO, they have committed violated the trust of their SO. The person they cheated *with* however, had no covenant or commitment to the cheater's SO and they had no obligation to enforce the cheater's own commitments.

The AP's actions *enabled* harm to the SO, but unless the AP and SO had some relationship independent of the cheater, I don't see any reason they deserve blame or contempt for that.

We all do things knowing they will cause harm to strangers every day, it's unavoidable to live in the modern world without helping other people and corporations cause harm to strangers all around the world.

At the very worst, the extent of the immorality of an AP's decision is no greater than the immorality of buying a cell phone from a manufacturer that uses child labor, which is not something for which anyone receives much social condemnation.

Notes – I'm talking here about the situation in which:

* the AP *knows* that the cheater is in a committed relationship and chooses to sleep with them anyway.
* the AP does not have any relationship with the cheater's SO.",dishonestgandalf,445,0.6600000262260437,871,1725570479,2024-09-05 16:07:59,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1f9xjku/cmv_affair_partners_have_virtually_no_culpability/,9,2024
1fgl7jq,CMV: People tend to treat obese people poorly,"I am a guy and my BMI is 42. So you can get a rough idea of how obese I am.

I feel that people in general treat me poorly due to my obese appearance.

Shop assistants don't really treat me well when I seek their assistance in shops. However, the assistants tend to be friendly to other people (who are not obese) right in front of my eyes.

And buying clothes is a painful experience for me. Many assistants will roll their eyes and say 'No' when I ask them if there are sizes available for obese people.

I also feel that people like refrain from talking to me in social events. I feel like they just talk to me for a short while for formality and try to end the conversation quickly. But I have noticed that they seem more eager to talk to other people (people who are slim). It makes me think that people find me being obese is unattractive and avoid conversing with me. 

I also feel that I get unpleasant stares from other commuters when I try to sit beside them in the public transport. So, I usually choose to stand in the public transport.

I also get unpleasant stares from other people when I try to take the lift in public. I guess maybe it's because I take up too much space in the lift.

1fagy4o,CMV: Most fines should be replaced with unpaid community service ,"Fines are not only unpopular and seen as a way for the state to make more money but I also find they're not very effective. Yes maybe someone will think twice but for many people it's probably worth the risk of getting fined once every few years to do something against the law (especially traffic violations). In most countries they're also not fair because for someone with more money it would pretty much be meaningless to pay a fine.

So why not replace them with unpaid community service with the number of hours depending on the gravity of what you've done? Community service is already something that exists so why shouldn't we expand it to most things that we currently apply fines for? I feel like people will probably think twice if they have to miss a large part of their weekend for a month rather than having to pay a fine in a few seconds.

Obviously there would be some exceptions but I'm saying for most fines it would work. For example, say someone is going 20mph (30km/h) over the speed limit. Rather than paying $100, continuing their day and probably not learning anything they should instead have to complete 5 hours of community service at the time of their choice but within a month.",macnfly23,438,0.9100000262260437,106,1725633909,2024-09-06 09:45:09,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fagy4o/cmv_most_fines_should_be_replaced_with_unpaid/,9,2024
1fdo64a,"CMV: ""white privilege"" would be better discussed if the termed was named something else.","Before I start, want to make this clear I am not here to debate the existence of racial disparities. They exist and are a damaging element of our society.

This is a question about how they are framed. 

I don't believe ""white privilege"" is the most fitting title for the term to describes things like the ability to walk down a street without being seen as a criminal, to have access to safe utilities, or to apply for a job without fear that your name would bar you from consideration. I don't see these as privilege, rather I see that is those capabilities as things I believe everyone inherently deserve.

A privilege, something like driving, is something that can be taken away, and I think framing it as such may to some sound like you are trying to take away these capabilities from white people, which I don't believe is the intent. 

Rather, I think the goal is to remove these barriers of hindrances so that all people may be able to enjoy these capabilities, so I think the phenomenon would be better deacribed as ""black barriers"" or ""minority hinderences"". I am not fixed on the name but you get the gist.

I think to change my mind you would have to convince me that the capabilities ascribed to white privilege are not something we want to expand access to all people as a basic expectation.",Atticus104,425,0.6700000166893005,855,1725990698,2024-09-10 12:51:38,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fdo64a/cmv_white_privilege_would_be_better_discussed_if/,9,2024
1frimcq,CMV: The stereotype constantly being pushed on reddit and other social medias that Gen Z has it worse than any generation leads to them disassociating and giving up on the hope of a bright future and will be far more harmful than anything the government will ever do/not do. ,"I was talking to a 21 year old the other day who was completely convinced that he was going to be subjected to a lifetime of financial and quality of life misery and he listed off all these reasons, blaming the government, economy, job market. He said he's given up saving money for a house and doesn't think he'll ever get married because the ""country wont be around long enough for it to matter"". After going on that rant, he goes on to talk about the 2 week trip to Europe he just got back from and drives a 2023 car and was wearing designer everything. I

 constantly see this narrative across all social media and especially on reddit that the ""system"" is broken and I don't think its a good thing at all. The government has always been shady, sleazy, corrupt, inept, and there is always something you can point at to place blame if you look hard enough. It's not an excuse to give up on your responsibility of your quality of life, or your moral obligation to try and make the society you live in a better place. 

Gen Z seems to have this attitude that it's not on them to fix anything and that the government should be responsible for their quality of life, and until that magic flip switches they don't need to take accountability for their bad decisions. This is leading to more and more Gen Z's stopping caring about the future, making self destructive decisions for immediate satisfaction, financially and otherwise which makes their lives worse, and then since they are miserable they want everyone else to be miserable, and anyone who isn't miserable got ""lucky"". I think when they get older they will be suffering the consequences of these choices far more than any amount of suffering caused by who is president, what dumb laws are made or not made etc. 

Despite all of the negativity you see on reddit the following are true and don't line up with the narrative that Gen Z has it worse than any other generation:

- Gun violence and violent crime in general has significantly decreased since the 80s and 90s. 

- Police violence has been stagnant, if not declining in the last 20 years. 

- The average IQ of people has increased several points per decade

- Wealth inequality is actually **decreasing** in the US, and decreasing even more rapidly globally

- The job market is basically back to average after the pandemic

- The average lifespan in the US is increasing significantly every year

- Women have far more opportunities and choices for career/lifestyle than ever before

-We are not at risk of overpopulation and natural resources are plenty and we are more efficient than ever at using them

-The worlds hunger problem while not solved, is dramatically better than it was 30 years ago. In the US almost nobody starves to death and those cases are due to severe neglect

Our parents lived through the civil rights movement, vietnam, the cold war, the dot com bubble, 9/11, the 08 housing bubble, the 2012 recession, they ate microwave TV dinners and now are dying of cancer at a much higher rate than ever before.

There are really big subs (political, news, suppose to be fun, various subs) on reddit, I won't be naming them who ban people because of their activities on exmuslim subs. That's just discrimination. Many leftists on reddit are also silent about it. So many exmuslims do not have a safe place to talk about their religion related traumas, and its so unfair on them that they get banned for it on bigger subs. There are gay people, girls who don't want to wear hijab anymore, people who had to leave their countries etcetc. I don't think reddit should allow this. I understand banning them on islamic subs but not on irrelevant subs?

If Trump loses he'll not concede and his supporters will believe that he won and will not support Kamala Harris' policies and if Kamala Harris loses, Trump will likely do many unpopular things that would seem inconceivable to Harris supporters, similar to his previous term.

1fc3l7o,cmv: there is no reason sex work should be illegal,"The number 1 argument against it is that there is a potential for sex trafficking, but this doesn't mean you ban the practice as a whole, the logical next step is that you make the job safer (which could be better done if it was regulated), not ban it unless inherently the position had some aspect of sex trafficking to it, , we wouldn't and don't apply this logic to most other facets of life, (don't drive cars because you could die in a car crash), and especially not other jobs, the reason it's illegal can't be solely based on how much harm it causes. 

The second most common argument is that it is inherently coercive, that the sex worker is inherently in a lesser position of power, and it is not completely consensual from both sides, in this case, I don't know why sex would be someone magically different than any other scenario where some inherent aspect of the person is being used for monetary gain (ignoring the fact that sex work isn't entirely based on the body of the worker anyway). You could certainly argue that by nature of their life circumstances, a mcdonalds employee is pressured into working in a job they don't want in the same way sex work couldn't be considered technically consensual because the sex worker isn't doing it for their own enjoyment necessarily, but because they have to because of life circumstances.

1fqap5y,"CMV: If the private market fails, flood insurance should not be federally subsidized.","I am conflicted. I don't want friends and family to be left in the street, but I also don't believe the federal government should step in and use tax dollars to cover property damages for those who chose to live in flood prone areas. Those people chose to live in risky areas and people in less risky areas should not share the burden of costs incurred due to that risk. I get that the whole idea of insurance is to spread said burden around, but at least with insurance you choose to get a policy which differs from taxes where you have no choice. Change my view. 

To give an idea of the situation: Private insurance is either unavailable due to the level of risk or prohibitively expensive. With global warming causing more storms, rising sea levels exacerbating flooding, and a huge portion of the population being located on the coast this issue will only get worse. Also, if you have any ideas on solutions for the failing flood insurance market in states on the US gulf coast like Florida please add those.

1f8yzr0,Cmv: Bruce wayne would improve Gotham much more by investing his billions in society rather than by becoming batman,"According to Forbes, our hero has a wealth of nearly 10 billion in a city that is blatantly a dystopia where there is a huge class difference.

Now, stop robberies is a heroic thing to do but the high rate of criminality in gotham is due to the extreme poverty and social difference.
The Joker can be see as a proof that super-criminals of Gotham did not pop up from another planet of pire evilness but arise also because of the sick society they live in.

My view is that the crime in gotham would be less if the billionaire invested in schools and social works or used his money to make a political rise instead of buying some million-dollar suits to beat up a single mugger.

It be summarized as follows:

1. Batman tends not to save the world (like superman) but his city (like spider man)

2. Gotham is a socio-economical nightmare and this has caused its high criminal rate (super criminal aside), anyway despite the super criminal the majority of suffering in common people of the city is caused by poverty and instability 

3. Batman would have the power to change the whole city by his economic means but instead of curing the causes of evil (the dystopian society) he tries to solve only the effects it produces (crime).

In conclusion, yes maybe you would have still Super villains but common thieves and murderers would decrease much more by improving the city wuth money than by punching some of them in the streets dressed up as a bat.

It's not ""if you can't prove it you're going to be punished"" it's ""if you get caught lying you'll be punished"" those are 2 very different things.

It's also telling that no one else has this opinion for other crimes. For example if I have black neighbors and tell everyone ""I saw them break into my house and steal shit"" and then a month later go ""no, I was just mad at them and wanted revenge"" they would support punishment for those false accusations.

You have to have a really fucked up sense of justice where 1 person can make accusations and punish someone and then be let off the hook when they're caught lying. There's no justice for the victim at all. People will say it doesn't happen, but literally everyone knows a person who's life was ruined with a false accusation.
