1hxbia1,"CMV: until democrats figure out why their party couldn’t beat someone like Trump instead of blaming Trump and his voters, they are destined to keep losing","Democrats on Reddit hate to hear this. I know it because any sentiment like this is usually immediately downvoted. “It’s them! Why can they get away with everything! Their voters are selfish, dumb, and/or racist!”

Yeah whatever that might be true but at the end of the day, if democrats couldn’t pick someone more attractive to the voters than Donald Trump then they need to figure out why that is and what to do about it. 

Because frankly the more whining democrats do about what the other side voted for and wants, the more they will continue to push voters in that direction.  

I won’t even go into all the shit dems have done wrong. I voted for Kamala myself bc not Trump was enough motivation for me but not Trump isn’t good enough these days so they need to figure out what is. 

It’s along the same of if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself. Can’t expect other people to change, to want what you want, etc. you have to step up and change and do things yourself to get what you want. 

For some reason democrats don’t understand this applies to politics as well. ",Itchy-Version-8977,4351,0.8399999737739563,3164,1736424971,2025-01-09 06:16:11,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hxbia1/cmv_until_democrats_figure_out_why_their_party/,1,2025
1icegiw,CMV: America has gotten so fat that overweight people are viewed as average weight and average weight people are viewed as skinny,"Ok went down a bit of a rabbit hole the CDC says that 
73.6% of American adults are either overweight or obese. At first I was like this percentage doesn't make sense. Then I started to think that I'm probably just so used to looking at people that are a bit overweight my perception of what's skinny healthy overweight obese is probably warped. I'm also aware that bmi doesn't automatically mean healthy weight and doesn't account for muscle mass so that could skew the results a bit. But still 73.6% is a huge number and I really don't see musle mass being the lone cause for this.

1i22ljg,CMV: People flocking to Rednote proves the Governments argument about the TikTok ban,"Most people believe the reason the Federal Government banned TikTok was because of data collection, which is for sure part of it, but that's not the main reason it was banned. It was banned because of concerns that a foreign owned social media app, particularly one influenced directly by a foreign Government can manipulate US citizens into behaving in a way that benefits them.

No one knew what Rednote was 2 weeks ago in the US. All it took was a few well placed posts encouraging people to flock to a highly monitored highly censored app directly controlled by the CCP and suddenly an unknown app in the United States rocketed to the number 1 app in the country. 

This is an app that frequently removes content mentioning LGBTQ rights, anything they view as immodest, and any discussion critizing the CCP- a party actively engaging in Genocide against the Uyghurs. Yet you have a flood of young people who just months ago decried the US's response to the Gazan crisis flocking to an app controlled by a government openly and unapologetically engaging in Genocide. 

This was not an organic movement. If one is upset at the hamstringing of free speech their first reaction would not be to rush to an app that is controlled by a government that has some of the worst rankings of free speech globally. All it took was a few well placed posts on people's fyp saying ""Give the US the middle finger and join rednote! Show them we don't care!""

1i1qdgi,CMV: Muslim immigrants demanding Sharia Law in Europe should go back home ,"I think that Muslims who have immigrated to European nations and are now demanding Sharia Law (or the choice to be tried under Sharia) in that country should go back to their home countries. I’m a left leaning person and respect everyone’s religion and beliefs, but I don’t think they should be forced on others or the people who practice said religions should be harassing people who don’t follow the same. There have been protests lately in Germany where Muslims are demanding Sharia law, and polls show that a large number of middle eastern Muslim immigrants living in France, England, Denmark etc support bringing Sharia Law to those countries. I don’t believe that Sharia goes well whatsoever with western values, and I don’t think they should even have the option to be tried under sharia in these countries either. Sharia law includes things like: 

- Killing someone who decides to leave the Muslim faith 
- Not much freedom for Women 
- Sex before marriage is punishable by death 
- Homosexuality punishable by death
- Women unable to travel for more than a couple of days without a male guardian 
- Death Penalty/ Extreme over the top punishment for thieves 
- Grown men being able to marry young girls 

These things don’t align whatsoever with most western values.

If middle eastern immigrants in Europe (or anywhere else for that matter but mainly focusing on Europe rn) that are demanding Sharia Law should go back to their home countries or to a country that has Sharia if it’s that big of a deal to them. I just don’t see why they’re in a western country if they don’t agree with western values.

The idea that a POTUS can rake in billions and billions of dollars in personal wealth - becoming one of the world's richest people overnight - as a new, completely unethical perk of being POTUS, is sickening. Things have gone too far, and Congress has a constitutional duty to react to this quickly and without partisan breakdown. If the US Congress cannot bring themselves to remove a POTUS who has personally benefitted from the Presidency on day one by billions and created massive conflicts of interest to the discharge of his duties - then they have simply outlived their purpose, and it is necessary to begin again.

1i7wbcj,"cmv: Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman are dangerous and do not deserve to have the platform they have. They are naive, fragile and inauthentic leaders of a cult.","Background: I once was an avid listener of ‘the rogansphere’ podcasts such as Joe Rogan, Lex Fridman and their friends. I stopped after realising that they are no longer some apolitical piece of individual media but something entirely else.
I have changed my mind to now be very anti-Rogan and I am amongst many male peers who are still in it or entering it. It was a phase for me and I hope it is for them too. 

My view: 
Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman are the kind of people who really like to appear as indifferent and open-minded but they have a really specific agenda. It seems as though their ideas of merit all come from martial arts, physical fitness, counter-academia, comedy and your willingness to partake in popular conspiracies. 

We all know Joe Rogan is not academic or by any means a genius, and he would even agree. But the fact that he uses his platform to encourage and broadcast ideas that he likes without any proper debating or counterpoints means that he is, intentionally or not, propagating an agenda. I’m afraid the usual argument of ‘it’s his podcast he can have whoever he wants on’ is just not acceptable now. His platform is too big and he should take responsibility for the ideas he is spreading.

Lex Fridman is a total worm. His monologues and soliloquies, I once saw as charming, are so naive, cringe and insufferable. A total narcissist who needs people to love him and view him as some innocent soul who only wants peace and love. He’s always like ‘I am trying my best’. Well do better, you have a massive platform and if you really want to be indifferent than be authentically indifferent rather than riding the coat tails of Rogan and Musk. He is just echoing the same agenda as the rest of the Rogansphere. The fact that in his podcast with President Zelenskyy, he has the nerve to question a world leader’s willingness to negotiate a peace deal with Russia in such a naive and holier-than-thou way just goes to show how these idiots aren’t equipped to ask proper questions and be reliable talk pieces for us to listen to. 

They also have massively contributed to division within the culture wars, much more so than what they claim ‘wokeness’ has.
They are becoming talk pieces for the far-right and seriously doing a lot more damage to the world than they are claiming. 

Please tell me how these guys are useful, why they deserve their platform and how they aren’t a total cult.

1hsaw8u,CMV: Non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries,"Based on my personal experience, what I've been hearing from my relatives, friends and co-workers, and also what I've read online on various forums, blogs, social media posts, I strongly believe that non-white countries are a lot more ignorant toward ""minorities"" or people who are considered non-white. In modern days most white countries would gladly accept immigrants and politically and socially they have dedicated laws and resources that are meant to help immigrants. Since the majority of white countries have a history of colonizing the world, modern history and social culture focus a lot on the sentiment of accepting people who are different than you, or simply the idea of racial/ethnic diversity and inclusion when it comes to representation and treatment. The school system or general education emphasizes on that, and all the organizations and firms would also follow and do the same(even if they have ulterior motive/not being genuine). As long as you grow up in a modern environment, you will learn about racism and that miniorities are perceived as ""vulnerable"" and there is this idea of treating people with respect no matter their cultural background, skin color, language etc.

Most white countries are diverse and have a lot of non-white citizens and migrants who yet to obtain their documents. In contrast, non-white countries are less immigrant-friendly and hence the society generally is not very aware of the aforementioned ideology/concept related to diversity, inclusion, racism etc. 

In Japan for example, there are restaurants can out right say no to people who look foreign(especially those with darker skintones) to them and use the ""no foreigner"" excuse to deny non-Japanese customers in the disguise of xenophobia. Such excuse would not be acceptable in western society. If a restaurant owner from UK, France, U.S, Canada denies someone who is foreign from entering their restaurant just because they are a foreigner or in the worst case that they believe they look foreign by their ethnicity, they will get sued and exposed on social media, and by laws and societal standards they will lose their license to operate. 

A Taiwanese friend of mine also told me that he has experienced way more casual/systematic racism in Congo than in other european countries he has lived in(he travels around because he works as an intepreter for a logistic company). From being stopped by police and asked to pay dirty money since he looks asian, to being denied rental housing even though his paperwork was perfect to Congolese casually pulling their eyes and mimick chinese person speaking, the incident amount is absurd as opposed to what he experienced in Canada, U.S and New Zealand. Such contrast of racist incidents are also reported a lot by my other friends who are from different ethnicities and a particular Pakistani friend who has very dark skin of mine said he was denied multiple jobs when he was working in UAE because his employers outright prefer to hire white caucasian, arab or even east asian workers because ""it makes the company looks more professional"". There are no specific laws that will define prejudice/racism in many context in these countries and even if they are, many can get away with it and the society as whole does not put enough emphasis to fight agianst racial/ethnic discirmination like what the western society does.

In conclusion, I believe non-white countries are a lot more racist than white countries, and its not just limited to casual, day to day personal racism but also systematic racism. (See how China can outright limits the freedom of any ethnic minorities or lock away foreigners as the authority deems so, or that African countries can infringe the rights of white/non-black citizens or that the fact non-white countries do not have enough immigrant politicians in the government because people do not vote for them and they gain no power and favorism even in elections etc).",padorUWU,1880,0.800000011920929,810,1735868750,2025-01-02 19:45:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hsaw8u/cmv_nonwhite_countries_are_a_lot_more_racist_than/,1,2025
1hvu7na,CMV: Western countries are the least racist countries in the world,"So unlike what much of Reddit may want you to believe Western countries by and large are actually amongst the least racist countries on earth. So when we actually look at studies and polls with regards to racism around the world we actually see that the [least racist countries](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/least-racist-countries) are actually all Western countries, while the [most racist countries](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/most-racist-countries) are largely non-Western countries.

In some of the largest non-Western countries like China or India for example racism is way more prevalant than it is in the West. In China for example they openly show ads like[ this one ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36394917)on TV and in cinemas, where a Chinese woman puts a black man into a laundry machine and out comes a ""clean"" fair-skinned Chinese man. 

And in India colorism still seems to be extremely prevelant and common place, with more dark-skinned Indians often being systemtically discriminated against and looked down upon, while more light-skinned Indians are typically favored in Indian society.

And Arab countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar or United Arab Emirates according to polls are among the most racist countries on earth, with many ethnic minorities and migrant workers being systemtically discrimianted against and basically being subjected to what are forms of slave labor. Meanwhile the least racist countries accroding to polls are all Western countries like New Zealand, Canada or the Netherlands.

Now, I am not saying that the West has completely eliminated racism and that racism has entirely disappeared from Western society. Surely racism still exists in Western countries to some extent. And sure the West used to be incredibly racist too only like 50 or 60 years ago. But the thing is the West in the last few decades by and large has actually made enormous progress with regards to many social issues, including racism. And today Western countries are actually by and large the least racist countries in the world.

1ibmxfc,CMV: It's entirely reasonable and not hypocritical to doubt the results of the 2024 election,"To be clear, I'm not saying Trump cheated to win the 2024 election. I don't know that and I don't think we ever will know that for certain. And due to the post-election security gaps that is true for every election- though I see no reason to doubt other elections. 

But when a notorious cheater facing prison who was despised by many, who threw a tantrum when he lost the popular vote last time, not only wins an election but wins the popular vote in every single swing state... I think it's reasonable to have some doubts. Especially when it happens after false bomb threats from a foreign power are called into polling places, forcing everybody there to evacuate. 

What's done is done, but given the circumstances I think  more questions should have been raised after the votes were counted and I think it's entirely reasonable and not hypocritical to doubt the results. I'm not saying Trump should be removed from power- I think he's a terrible president and person, but barring concrete evidence of election interference, as far as anybody knows, he was elected fair and square. But at least for me, this election will always have a question mark above it. But I welcome other views on this subject. Change my view.

1hxh0ka,"CMV: If Trump attacked Greenland and Denmark tried to defend it, his government wouldn't survive it","Currently, Denmark is close to perfect US ally...

* They have been NATO Allies for 75 years
* They spend >2 percent of GDP on defence
* They mostly buy American equipment and try
* When US trigerred Article 5, Denmark answered and their troops didn't shy away from combat in most violent parts of Afghanistan and Iraq. They actually had very similar per capita losses to the US in Afghanistan and highest of the non-US countries
* They gave very significant amounts of material to Ukraine, including F-16 fighter jets
* They allow US to have bases on their territory in Greenland and do whatever US wants there
* They have overwhelmingly favourable view of the US and support most of its foreign policy

If Trump decided to attack territory of such a nation, most of the US public would certainly see it as an incredible betrayal and he would have trouble keeping power. If Denmark decided to try to defend Greenland and internet would get flooded with imagery of US forces destroying Danish troops, who are merely defending their border, I don't believe that even the hardline Republican party members would be able to stomach it.

1icdp5l,CMV: Billionaires shouldn’t exist,"The existence of billionaires is proof of a rigged system that mistakes greed for “innovation” and exploitation for “merit.” It is not a sign of a thriving economy.

No one earns a billion dollars. You *extract* it by underpaying workers, dodging taxes, privatizing public goods,  commodifying basic human needs, etc.

The math doesn't lie. Even spending $1 million a day, it would take almost 3,000 years to go through a billion dollars. The top 1% of Americans hoard $44 trillion in wealth which is more than the bottom 90% combined. Meanwhile ending global poverty would cost roughly $300 billion *annually*. Jeff Bezos could single-handedly fund that for 50 years and still die richer than Croesus. This isn’t capitalism. It’s just feudalism with better PR.  

“But they create jobs!”

No, workers create value and billionaires just skim it. Elon Musk’s wealth surged by $150 billion during the pandemic while his factory employees fought for bathroom breaks and unions. The Walton family’s fortune for example was built on welfare-subsidized Walmart wages so low, taxpayers foot the bill for their employees’ food stamps.  

And philanthropy is a scam. Gates and Zuckerberg don’t “donate” wealth. They stash it in tax-free foundations to lobby governments, dodge accountability, and shape policy in their image. I’m no other toke has this been more true then now with Trump. 

Want to end malaria? Pay. Your. Taxes. Let democratically elected leaders, not unelected oligarchs, decide how to fix society.

So do teachers, nurses, and firefighters. They just don’t get to offshore their salaries to the Cayman Islands. Billionaires aren’t “self-made.” They’re products of publicly funded infrastructure, education, and research.

1i31opi,"CMV: Changing the correct term from ""homeless"" to ""unhoused"" does nothing to break the social stigma and is arguably a worse term","I want to open a discussion on the terms ""homeless"" and ""unhoused"" as I have seen many different opinions on this. Personally, I think it's counterproductive to call out people for being offensive because they use the term homeless for a few different reasons.

1. From an etymology standpoint, these words mean almost the same exact thing. House and home are synonymous. -Less means to be without, and un- means the opposite of. So homeless means to be without a home, and unhoused means you are not housed.
2. I think ""unhoused"" excludes people who choose to live with no stationary home. To me, homeless better describes this because it just means to be without a permanent dwelling. Unhoused, to me, could imply that the norm is housed and you are not. I think it can also imply you have become unhoused due solely to outside factors. Homeless, in my opinion, does not determine any fault or factor. It is simply to be without a permanent home. This is why I think it could be worse to use ""unhoused"" as that word has a higher chance of having a connotation attached to it.
3. Changing this term does nothing to help the homeless/unhoused population. Because they have similar definitions, no social stigma is decreased in changing it. Homeless is not a slur. Instead of bringing attention to programs and support for the population and trying to resolve the problem, it instead leads to mainly calling out others for being ""offensive"" to the population. Calling out others for being offensive is not a problem on it's own obviously; we should all be kinder to one another, and it's lead to getting rid of outdated hurtful words like the r word. But I do think it's an issue when there's almost no discernable difference between the words' meaning. It defies common sense.

I don't understand how anyone with more knowledge than someone cannot communicate with someone who has less knowledge than them. How if *you* know the answer, you can't communicate it with someone patiently enough to come up with common ground.

The problem is the gap in communication. We all get that there are no compromise righties that won't believe a word of what you're saying, but the inability to create mutual understanding is on you. If you can't communicate, then I'm sorry but I don't feel bad for you. There is obviously a lack of respect, and yes, I will forgive some of the interfamily dynamics that can get anyone on edge, but the overall loss of the left is due to their inability to humble themselves to create paradigms that people who oppose them can understand. It is to be on the same page (whether you agree or disagree) that is something worth fighting for, not to simply be astounded that someone thinks ""illegal immigrants are ruining the country,"" ""climate change isn't real"" ""x, y or z."" The *way* you communicate *facts* is what is harming you. 

Trust me when I say that if you are in position of control (are smarter), you should be able to reason with someone you disagree with. Ask any parent if they understand what their kid is saying, yet they can still reason with them and create dialogue. I truly do not believe that someone who is supposed to be smarter, cant find reason. And yes, the reason in this dialogue isnt ""you now agree with me,"" it's the patience to understand that you got them to think that you may be right. 

My true advice to anyone is to work on your communication and reasoning skills then stomping on someone. Learn the advantage of progress versus winning. Achieve common ground with someone you disagree with. 

My advice to your response isn't to simply blame the right. I've given the examples where you can blame them (furthest right, eg., bad actors; family). Let's make the goal to create respect than winning. And we all know that the right has its problems, but just remember, this thread is about you, the left.",poopchow,1013,0.7099999785423279,1398,1737653281,2025-01-23 11:28:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i88qtx/cmv_despite_being_more_knowledgeable_wealthier/,1,2025

1ie2m3n,"CMV: Until Melania and Baron Trump are deported, nobody else in the US should be ripped from their homes.","CMV: Nobody in the U.S. should be deported until Melania and Barron Trump are deported, because by Donald Trump's own definition, they are not legal citizens and should be the first to go—along with Elon Musk.

Premise 1: Trump’s Own Immigration Standards  
Donald Trump has consistently advocated for stricter immigration policies, including ending birthright citizenship, revoking visas for those who ""take American jobs,"" and heavily scrutinizing chain migration—the very system through which Melania Trump obtained citizenship. Under his own logic, Melania’s citizenship, obtained via the EB-1 visa (intended for people with ""extraordinary ability""), should be considered invalid, as her qualifications were dubious. If chain migration is unacceptable, then her parents, who became citizens through her, also should not be here. Barron Trump, as the child of an allegedly ineligible citizen, would also lack valid status under this framework.  

Premise 2: Consistency in Deportation Priorities
If the U.S. government enforces deportation policies, it should start with the most high-profile and politically connected individuals who benefited from questionable immigration practices. Trump’s own rhetoric suggests that immigrants take jobs, commit crimes, and exploit loopholes. Elon Musk, a billionaire immigrant, has been accused of labor violations and manipulating the visa system to benefit himself and his businesses. If deportation is about protecting American workers, Musk should be at the top of the list.  

Premise 3: Moral and Logical Fairness  
It is unjust to target vulnerable, low-income immigrants while allowing wealthy or politically powerful immigrants to remain. If Trump’s base truly believes in enforcing immigration laws without exception, they should demand the deportation of those who benefited from the very systems he condemns—starting with his own family. Until this happens, no one else should be deported, as doing so would be an inconsistent and hypocritical application of immigration law.  

Conclusion
If Trump’s immigration policies are to be applied fairly, Melania and Barron Trump, as well as Elon Musk, should be first in line for deportation. Until that happens, the U.S. should halt all other deportations to avoid selective enforcement that disproportionately harms the powerless while protecting the elite.

I am also left. I am not super politically active, but I know enough about Trump to dislike him. Aside from his treatment of minority groups such as LGBTQ people and his ignorance of climate change, I also dislike his economic tatiff plans for the US and how they seem to mostly help the 1%. Project 2025 is also a whole different can of worms. And I also heard something about him raising the prices for medicine already. And his relationship to Elon who supports the AFD, did two nazi gestures and censors Twitter is.. well. You know it.

But here we are.

But I want to try and be unbiased. I dont even want you to prove to me that he was a better choice, just a reasonable one. Make me say ""Well I disagree but I can see why one might think like that.""

1hwv4lp,CMV: Disney should make new movies with minority leads instead of race swapping in remakes ,"Literally the title. I’m a huge Disney fan but this is so lazy. I feel like if they actually cared about inclusion and representing minorities, they’d make original stories that represent them, not the half assed remakes that they’re using for cash grabs. I’m not one of those “why is Disney woke now 😡” kind of people, I’m happy to see more representation but I just hate how they’re doing it. Race swapping white characters like Ariel the mermaid and Hercules in live action remakes is just a dead giveaway that they’d rather take the easy way out instead of actually taking time to make fresh stuff. 

I feel like Disney was more inclusive back when they didn’t try so hard. Stuff like Pocahontas, Mulan, Lilo & Stitch and Princess and the frog. It felt real. Now it just feels so forced that many are unable to appreciate it. 

With only making remakes with minority leads instead of taking time to make them their own original princess/ main character I feel like they’re basically saying “you’re not worth the time of a new project”. Why can’t they just continue with things like Encanto, Moana, and Wish? Have they ran out of ideas or something?

1i5akbz,"CMV: When you are very naive, you believe the USA is the greatest country in the world. When you start to learn more, you believe it is a mess, almost a 3rd world country. When you are truly educated, you realize it is amazing compared to most of the world, and probably in the top 10 to live in.","this is at least what I gathered from fellow argentinians opinions on the US. The reality is that it has lots of very large problems to tackle, but in comparisson to the rest of the world, in terms of standard of living, it is one of the best countries in the world. for women, for LGBT people, for working people in general.

countries that may be even better are probably in the single digits, or low double digits: norway and switzerland probably, then maybe denmark and finland. much more difficult to determine are countries such as germany which is probably about the same, sweden which is in my opinion slightly worse than the US, maybe taiwan, australia.

the fact is, the US is very rich. it has ridiculous amount of disposable income, and while it is economically unequal, still most people have more purchasing power than in other developed countries. it is very good for doing business, inversting, it is very good compared to the world in LGBT laws and people's opinion on LGBT issues. it is one of the least racists countries in the world, if you travelled a lot you would know about it.

in my 18-20s I was very anti-USA, then I educated myself and put it in the top 10 best countries to live in. which is specially commendable giving its very large land area and population to manage. the single worst issue compared to other developed countries is security: homicides and its GPI is very much worse than other comparable countries. then in democracy, GINI, health it could be better. but in median income, GDP PPP, GDP PPP per capita, poverty rates, unemployment rates, HDI,  business, competitive, innovation indexes, economic freedom, etc. is a beast.

It would be a pleasure for most people in the world to live in the US. I travelled to the US, and was able to see, apart from just reading and educating myself about it. it is spectacular. infrastructure, cleanliness, the level of houses in suburbia and city centre. 

whats more, in economic and population (fertility & immigration) fronts, it has a very bright future. europe and developed asia face much more challenges, though this is a little bit more subjective.

BACK to the title: due to being the only superpower of the world, its bast cultural and propagandistic influences in the world makes it so that when you are naive, you think its amazing. then you start to learn about opioid crisis, health insurance crisis, uber-conservatives, etc so you think its a developing nation. after that, you get the gift of nuance and start to see that, comperatively, it is truly an amazing country to live in.

to change my view, you need to

1. establish the US as a probably non top 10 country to live in

2. convince me that most naive people in the world 'worship' the US, then when they learn some stuff they hate it, and then people who are very passionate about global politics, economics, int. relations, that read & watch much about comparable standards of living from country to country with nuance and an open mind, love the US or at least respect it a lot.",cuervodeboedo1,809,0.7300000190734863,586,1737324508,2025-01-19 16:08:28,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i5akbz/cmv_when_you_are_very_naive_you_believe_the_usa/,1,2025
1hz13nc,CMV: Obama laughing with trump is not something to be concerned about,"I’m not too desperate to get into most political talk, but people being concerned with Obama laughing at a joke by trump has been quite the stir recently. Ive seen posts on a few subreddits making the claim that the issue is not left or right, but classism, while using the photo of trump and Obama laughing at jimmy carters funeral. 

I’ve wanted to make the counter argument that the photo can be seen as a positive for Obama. I feel as though he has the capability to sit with anyone and perceive them as human. The ability to sit down and chat with your opposition is a positive trait that Obama uses as both leverage and assurity of level headedness from himself. 

I’m not going to deny the statement that class issues are a huge problem. Class inequality is what I believe to be one of our bigger issues in the United States and needs to be addressed. However, I do believe that Obama is not in the wrong for the ability to laugh at a joke by their opposition party, nor does it conclude that he is a problem with such an issue. In fact, I think that is something that Trump had begun to remove from the political scene compared to all other elections before his first run in 2016. You can compare political debates before the 2016 election and find more level headedness while still disagreeing. 

I also apologize if some of this is a bit unclear, feel free to have me rewrite some statements. I’ve just woken up and a bit hungover, idk why I have the energy to discuss this but I’m down for it lol

1i59te1,CMV: Conservatives Will Dominate America for the Next ~20 Years,"Note: By “conservatives,” I mean both Republicans and conservative Democrats.

Trump’s win in November was resounding in every way except the final popular vote tally. Trump won every swing state, and every state moved to the right. Trump fell short of a true majority of the popular vote and only won it by 1.5 points, but it was still the first time a Republican won the popular vote since 2004. Additionally, Republicans won over millions of voters from majority-Democratic voting blocs.

Many left-leaning people have claimed, falsely, that Democrats lost due to low turnout. In truth, the 2024 election saw the second- highest turnout of any presidential election, and swing states like Georgia and North Carolina saw record turnout. By all metrics, the Harris-Walz team’s attempts to “get out the vote” worked. They successfully got out the vote… for Trump. Indeed, Trump won both Independents and first-time voters. Trump won *because* of high turnout. High turnout no longer benefits Democrats.

All post-election polling has suggested that Republicans are now the more popular party. Overall, America shifted to the right by four points in 2024. One poll found that 43 percent of voters viewed Democrats favorably and 50 percent viewed them unfavorably. Increasingly, Democrats are viewed as affluent, out-of-touch, college-educated elites who ask for votes and never return the favor. Most voters trust Republicans more on the economy, immigration, and crime. The economy and immigration were the two most important issues for voters last year. Most voters support mass deportations, which Trump has repeatedly promised to begin on day one. It’s obvious that MAGA has won over the majority of voters, which is also why Democrats are starting to move towards the center on issues, immigration chief among them.

The shifts among key demographics are even more alarming. Harris barely won a majority of the Latino vote, and most Latino men voted for Trump. Harris won Asians nationally, but Asians in Nevada shifted to the right by more than *50 points*. Democrats may have permanently lost the Muslim vote because Muslims hate ~~Jews~~ ~~Israel~~ “genocide,” and the recent ceasefire deal, in which Trump was apparently instrumental, might be the final nail in the coffin, especially considering Muslims’ social views make white evangelicals seem progressive. That could mean that Democrats will never again win Michigan. Other racial and religious groups, such as blacks and Jews, also shifted to the right by smaller amounts.

However, the most alarming shift is among young voters. According to the AP VoteCast, Harris only won young voters by 4 points; Biden carried them by more than 30. Young men especially are rapidly shifting towards the GOP. The reasons for this shift are debated, though many attribute it to perceived abandonment and/or demonization of men by the left. Also worth noting are the issues that are genuinely worse for men, such as the male suicide rate. For instance, the percentage of college students who are female now is roughly equal to the percentage of college students who were male prior to Title IX, and college enrollment among men is declining. More and more men are opting for trade schools instead, largely due to costs. This is important because college-educated people tend to be more liberal (the so-called “diploma divide”), while tradespeople tend to be very conservative. Lastly, since young voters’ views tend to be the most malleable, it stands to reason that more and more young voters will embrace MAGA.

This shift to the right is not limited to the US. In fact, the West as a whole is moving sharply to the right, largely for the same reasons as the US: the economy and immigration. The Conservatives are all but guaranteed to take control of Canada later this year and were even before Trudeau’s resignation. Although Labour took control of Parliament just last year, its popularity has already plummeted, and Reform UK’s popularity has surged. The SPD is poised to get voted out this year, and the AfD is becoming more popular by the minute. Now, the situation in Europe is different - and frankly, more dire - than the situation here in the States. Europe is currently facing widespread economic stagnation, and European society is being upended by immigration, particularly from the Islamic world. Similarly, largely unrestricted immigration in Canada has inflated home prices and created numerous social issues. As a result, left-wing parties haven’t been less popular since the Cold War, and right-wing populist parties who claim to have solutions are rapidly gaining popularity. Arguably, Trump’s comeback was the final nail in the coffin for the progressivism of the early century. At the time of writing, all signs point to a generation of right-wing dominance of America and the West as a whole.",Emperor_Kyrius,697,0.7099999785423279,1225,1737322633,2025-01-19 15:37:13,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i59te1/cmv_conservatives_will_dominate_america_for_the/,1,2025

1. We should be spending it here in America. Which I don’t understand why the 60billion that was proposed was too much foreign aid as it is roughly 1% of the budget. The U.S. military receives dozens of times more money in our annual budget to accomplish the same goal as the aid to Ukraine: protect American, our allies and our interests around the world.

2. The war has gone on long enough and we should stop funding a brutal meat grinder. I could be on board with this if it weren’t for the fact that A. Ukraine is the country that was invaded B. We supplied the saudis long protracted war against the Houthis that went nowhere and we’ve been giving Israel billions in aid money for decades just so they can fight a never ending war.

1i852w8,"CMV: the term “Nazi” is an entirely appropriate approximate description of Trumpist Republicans based on a contemporaneous understanding of Nazi ideology, rather than a retrospective one.","Nazi isn't a generic slur. Neither does it require perfect specificity. Fascism itself is a collection of broad ideological goals, political tendencies, tactics, and aesthetics.

The idea of the Nazi as a cartoonishly evil villain stems from our retrospective understanding of what Nazism ultimately achieved. But for the average German citizen in the late 1920s-early 1930s, Nazism would have looked remarkably similar to Trumpism. The major exceptions are the nationalization of corporations and the explicit naming of Jews in the platform. The fact that today's GOP is smart enough to build on the Atwater/Nixon/Reagan Southern Strategy and not specifically call out racial and ethnic groups is a matter of tactics and degrees -- not a meaningful difference in ideology. In addition, you don't need to nationalize industry when you have a corporate oligarchy -- you can preserve the mythologies of capitalism while enjoying the benefits of corporate socialism. 

While some people may have reasonable concerns about the (over)use of the term ""Nazi"" to describe the American right today, many people who are pushing back against this language simply want cover to flirt with ideas and policies German Nazis would have loved. To advance the ideas without the label so those ideas appear respectable -- so they can rail against immigrants and trans people, remain in polite society and make extremism more acceptable. The rest are just pedants.

Here is the pre-war Nazi party platform:

1. We demand the union of all Germans in a Greater Germany on the basis of the right of national self-determination.
2. We demand equality of rights for the German people in its dealings with other nations, and the revocation of the peace treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain.
3. We demand land and territory (colonies) to feed our people and to settle our surplus population.
4. Only members of the nation may be citizens of the State. Only those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. Accordingly, no Jew may be a member of the nation.
5. Non-citizens may live in Germany only as guests and must be subject to laws for aliens.
6. The right to vote on the State’s government and legislation shall be enjoyed by the citizens of the State alone. We demand therefore that all official appointments, of whatever kind, whether in the Reich, in the states or in the smaller localities, shall be held by none but citizens.
We oppose the corrupting parliamentary custom of filling posts merely in accordance with party considerations, and without reference to character or abilities.
7. We demand that the State shall make it its primary duty to provide a livelihood for its citizens. If it should prove impossible to feed the entire population, foreign nationals (non-citizens) must be deported from the Reich.
8. All non-German immigration must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who entered Germany after 2 August 1914 shall be required to leave the Reich forthwith.
9. All citizens shall have equal rights and duties.
10. It must be the first duty of every citizen to perform physical or mental work. The activities of the individual must not clash with the general interest, but must proceed within the framework of the community and be for the general good.
We demand therefore:
11. The abolition of incomes unearned by work.
The breaking of the slavery of interest
12. In view of the enormous sacrifices of life and property demanded of a nation by any war, personal enrichment from war must be regarded as a crime against the nation. We demand therefore the ruthless confiscation of all war profits.
13. We demand the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations (trusts).
14. We demand profit-sharing in large industrial enterprises.
15. We demand the extensive development of insurance for old age.
16. We demand the creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class, the immediate communalizing of big department stores, and their lease at a cheap rate to small traders, and that the utmost consideration shall be shown to all small traders in the placing of State and municipal orders.
17. We demand a land reform suitable to our national requirements, the passing of a law for the expropriation of land for communal purposes without compensation; the abolition of ground rent, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.
18. We demand the ruthless prosecution of those whose activities are injurious to the common interest. Common criminals, usurers, profiteers, etc., must be punished with death, whatever their creed or race.
19. We demand that Roman Law, which serves a materialistic world order, be replaced by a German common law.
20. The State must consider a thorough reconstruction of our national system of education (with the aim of opening up to every able and hard-working German the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement). The curricula of all educational establishments must be brought into line with the requirements of practical life. The aim of the school must be to give the pupil, beginning with the first sign of intelligence, a grasp of the notion of the State (through the study of civic affairs). We demand the education of gifted children of poor parents, whatever their class or occupation, at the expense of the State.
21. The State must ensure that the nation’s health standards are raised by protecting mothers and infants, by prohibiting child labor, by promoting physical strength through legislation providing for compulsory gymnastics and sports, and by the extensive support of clubs engaged in the physical training of youth.
22. We demand the abolition of the mercenary [i.e. professional] army and the formation of a people’s army.
23. We demand legal warfare on deliberate political mendacity and its dissemination in the press. To facilitate the creation of a German national press we demand:
(a) that all editors of, and contributors to newspapers appearing in the German language must be members of the nation;
(b) that no non-German newspapers may appear without the express permission of the State. They must not be printed in the German language;
(c) that non-Germans shall be prohibited by law from participating financially in or influencing German newspapers, and that the penalty for contravening such a law shall be the suppression of any such newspaper, and the immediate deportation of the non-Germans involved.
The publishing of papers which are not conducive to the national welfare must be forbidden. We demand the legal prosecution of all those tendencies in art and literature which corrupt our national life, and the suppression of cultural events which violate this demand.
24. We demand freedom for all religious denominations in the State, provided they do not threaten its existence nor offend the moral feelings of the German race.
The Party, as such, stands for positive Christianity, but does not commit itself to any particular denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialist spirit within and without us, and is convinced that our nation can achieve permanent health only from within on the basis of the principle: The common interest before self-interest.
25. To put the whole of this program into effect, we demand the creation of a strong central state power for the Reich; the unconditional authority of the political central Parliament over the entire Reich and its organizations; and the formation of Corporations based on estate and occupation for the purpose of carrying out the general legislation passed by the Reich in the various German states.
The leaders of the Party promise to work ruthlessly—if need be to sacrifice their very lives—to translate this program into action.

I am not trying to be pro-China nor anti-China, but it is undeniable that the political relations between the USA and China are not great, and they are likely to get worse under the new Trump regime. Hence it is within the realm of reason for Americans to be be wary of Chinese agendas. (Again, I do not mean to be anti-Chinese.)

However, in my opinion, all the arguments I have heard about Chinese social media also apply to American social media. From my perspective as a European, the USA is a foreign power led by a dangerously unpredictable right-wing extremist. Elon Musk (who controls Twitter) is a close Trump-supporter, and as far as I can tell Mark Zuckerberg (who controls Facebook) also supports Trump. I don't know about the owners of other major social media such as YouTube or Reddit, but I do not trust any of these people. Any of these might ally with Trump and use their platforms to spread propaganda to support a Trumpist ideology. That could cause a lot of damage to my country and others.

If Chinese-owned social media are dangerous, then American-owned social media are just as dangerous. Especially under Trump, but also without Trump. Hence, if it is reasonable for the US Congress to regulate or ban TikTok, then it is just as reasonable for European countries to regulate or ban American-owned social media such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and also Reddit. 

(One problem, of course, would be that there is not much left. But I am not worried about that. In a hypothetical scenario where the EU bans all non-EU-controlled social media, a few EU-based ones would soon rise to replace them.)

1ibbe8c,"CMV: Colonialism was basically inevitable and some other power would eventually do it, if Western Europe didn't","From 16th century onwards, European powers had a really unique combination of opportunity and necessity. They had the means to start colonizing large swaths in the rest of the world and it perfectly fitted the economic needs of the slowly industrializing society. 

What on the other hand wasn't at all uncommon around the world was the desire for conquest and power and complete lack of morals towards achieving these goals. Be it the Qing China, the Mughals or the Ottomans, you would find countless examples of militaristic empires willing to enslave, exploit or genocide anyone standing in the way of their goals. Most African or American empires were maybe less successful, but hardly morally better in this regard.

Even if Europeans somehow decided to not proceed with colonizing the rest of the world, it was only a matter of time until another society undergoing industrialization needs the resources and markets and has the naval power to do exactly what the Europeans did. There was no moral blocks, which would prevent this from happening. 

If the Americas didn't get taken by the Europeans, they would simply face industrialized China or India a few hundred years later. Or maybe it would be the other way around. But in the fragmented world of the past, a  clash would eventually occur and there would probably be a winner.

Essentially it’s ‘fear’, he’s inciting people’s basic instincts talking about various boogeymen, immigrants, weak leaders, real fears that people have and mainly to amplify those in his base to distract them from his real motives (picking their pockets)

But it’s actually not his nature, he’s only scared of being laughed at. He’s not actually scared of immigrants or DEI hires or trans people himself.  He’s a rich well socialised guy who just basically wants to feel important and grab money.

He is using his tough guy image as a negotiating tactic to try and throw weight around, and it’s working as people are actually believing he’s crazy and destructive, and he will even do things until people complain.

He’s not sure how to actually do anything so he’s just saying a lot and listening to what latches on in people and what they say, just spitballing.

I think broadly society should have a mutually understood principle that even if you disagree or disapprove of someone's speech, they have the right to say it.

This includes supposed 'misinformation' and 'hate speech'.

As John Stuart Mill makes clear in On Liberty ""he who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that"", and ""“If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.”

Hate speech is a poorly worded and fascial set of legislation in the UK that can be used to prosecute anyone (including a young girl posting lyrics to a rap song and many teaching his dog to nazi salute as a joke - both of which have been arrested and prosecuted, though the former was released on appeal).

1i86unn,"CMV: I’m Afraid This Administration Will Make Life Substantially Worse for Black Americans, and I Don’t Know If There’s a Line They Won’t Cross","I’m scared, and I’m looking for reassurance. As a Black person, I’ve already concluded that Trump and Elon Musk are racist, based on their actions and statements. What I’m struggling with is this fear that life under this administration will get substantially worse for people like me—and that their supporters won’t ever draw a line, no matter how bad things get.

Here are some things that have already happened or seem to be in the works:
	
Ending Equal Opportunity Programs: Trump revoked policies aimed at promoting racial equity in hiring and government programs.

Stop-and-Frisk: He signed an executive order encouraging its return, which disproportionately impacts Black and brown communities.
	
Wildfire Risks: Water is being rerouted from Northern California, a region that hasn’t had major wildfires in years, to Central California. This feels like it’s putting lives at risk unnecessarily.
	
Elon Musk’s Nazi Affiliation: Musk has amplified neo-Nazi accounts on Twitter, seemingly supported Germany’s far-right party, and even made what looks like a Nazi salute at a public event.

I’m terrified of what this could escalate to. Discrimination in hiring might push more Black people into desperate situations like selling drugs or stealing to survive. With policies like stop-and-frisk, that could mean more of us ending up incarcerated. My biggest fear is that there’s no “step too far” for their supporters. Would things like migrant camps or even more explicit authoritarian measures finally make people realize this is heading into Nazi territory? Or will they just keep defending every action?

I’m not asking for someone to convince me these people aren’t racist—I’m already past that. I just want to believe that there’s a line they can’t cross, that legal systems, public resistance, or something will stop things from spiraling further.

Can anyone reassure me that there’s hope?

1hwzoat,"CMV: Trump is not fit to be the face of America, let alone the president.","This post is really just relevant to American users, but I'd like to hear the opinions of anybody outside the country if they do have a say. I, personally, do not understand how people can openly support Trump with the vast amount of information out there that definitely does not paint him as a good person. I've seen most supporters say that they voted for him hoping for cheaper gas prices, groceries, and to ""Make America Great Again."" I believe the country has never truly been great and needs much work, but that is an entirely different conversation.  
 Even if I did believe Trump could and would do everything his supporters are hoping for, I would not vote for him. Why? He was openly a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein for, according to Epstein himself, 10 whole years. There are clips of the two of them talking about women's looks - which I doubt their conversations were respectful after the ""grab 'em by the pussy"" comment. Trump says these exact words about Epstein: ""I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy... It is even said that he likes women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."" I'm not saying that Trump was a part of Epstein's crimes, but I would not be surprised if such news were to ever be revealed. I am simply pointing out who he has been associated with - for example, Matt Gaetz, who was said to have paid a 17-year-old girl for sex. Trump has faced similar allegations of sexual assault since 1970- 26 different allegations, to be exact. He has denied all of them, but considering the people he is around and the things he has said, it is very hard to believe him. As just about everyone knows, he IS a convicted felon.  
 America might need the cheaper gas prices, we might need the cheaper groceries, the walls, the need to be great, but is it truly worth putting the state of the country into the hands of a felon? The hands of a man that has likely touched and hurt women without a care in the world? Hands that shook with Jeffrey Epstein?

1i0lzxk,CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically,"I'll start with Biden's legislature passed during his term and explain why I think his tenure did not meaningfully advance the goals of the American left. 

Biden's first signature piece of legislature was the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which in fairness to Biden is not your typical giveaway to the wealthy. It included child tax credits that were wildly successful, I believe they cut the child poverty rate by half. However, these expired.

Via The New York Times, reporting on the stimulus package at the time:

*For a working single mother of a 3-year-old who earns the federal minimum wage — just under $16,000 a year — the bill would provide as much as $4,775 in direct benefits, Ms. Pancotti estimates. For a family of four with one working parent and one who remains unemployed because of child care constraints, the benefits could total $12,460.*

It was also refreshing to see after Trump's usually immodest boastings about his amazing soon to arrive infrastructure bill, that one was actually passed. Although the cost ($1 trillion) does seem excessive to me and it is irking that those who seemed to benefit most were large firms like CAT. 

Now the negatives:

the raw amount of spending is rather modest when put into perspective. Via Paul Krugman:

*But when I see news reports describe these laws as “*[*massive*](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/12/house-to-vote-on-inflation-reduction-act-tax-and-climate-bill.html)*” or huge, I wonder whether the writers have done the math. The infrastructure law will add* [*roughly $500 billion*](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/infrastructure-plan-will-add-400-billion-deficit-cbo-finds) *in spending over the next decade. The Inflation Reduction Act will increase spending by roughly* [*an additional half trillion*](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-inflation-reduction-act)*. A law to promote U.S.* [*semiconductor production*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-28/house-sends-52-billion-chip-bill-to-biden-for-his-signature?sref=qzusa8bC) *will add around $50 billion more. Overall, then, we’re talking about a bit more than $1 trillion in public investment over 10 years.*

*To put this in perspective, the Congressional Budget Office expects* [*cumulative gross domestic product*](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-05/57950-Outlook.pdf#page=13) *to be more than $300 trillion over the next decade. So the Biden agenda will amount to around one-third of one percent of G.D.P. Massive it isn’t.*

I am of the opinion that the CHIPS and Sciences Act was unnecessary or at least should have been amended as some Democratic senators suggested so that the chips companies receiving the subsidies didn't turn around and use the federal money on buybacks and dividends.

Speaking of stock buybacks, Biden's 1% tax on stock buybacks was welcome but in my opinion too modest to alter a practice that could potentially damage American competitiveness for the long term (as companies like IBM are spending more on buybacks than R&D)

I'm not sure what the ideal solution is to this (and obviously some of this is down to California's jurisdiction and its governor) but it doesn't seem to reflect well on Biden that in California the average home price is $700,000, which cannot be good for the average person. Recently, figures have also come out that US homelessness has risen to an all time high of 770,000. 

Wage growth adjusted for inflation on paper has been impressive (7.3% for the bottom 10% since 2019) it is  important to note that often the cost of living increases for these individuals have probably been greater than the official inflation statistics (grocery prices make up only 8% of the CPI but the average person in the bottom 10% spends more than 8% of their budget on groceries).

Biden cannot really be faulted for the nearly $400 billion in climate spending though in the IRA, good job there. 

Biden's student loan forgiveness plan (though this was not really his fault) ended up being hacked to pieces by the Supreme Court. 

Regulatory outlook:

Lina Khan's FTC came in with an ambitious plan to rewrite existing US antitrust practice. The results have been decidedly mixed. Lawsuits against Microsoft and Meta failed. A good symbol of where policy has become misguided under Biden is that the FTC sued to block the Tapestry-Capri Holdings merger over whether prices for affordable handbags would become too high.

1i89lhx,CMV: Pardoning the insurrectionists will prove disastrous for the Republican Party,"I’m open to having my mind changed on this, but I personally fail to see how this plays out well for the GOP. 

I believe this move has short term effects that help Trump’s administration earn some brownie points with MAGA supporters but in the long term I think it might do more harm than good.

I feel like this move solidifies the GOP as a chaotic, anti-law-and-order party, whereas usually they aim to be seen as the opposite. It obviously alienates moderate and independent voters who were disgusted with the events of Jan 6 - as well as younger voters who, as I understand it, are especially critical of the Jan 6 attack on the capitol.

If that isn’t enough, this would solidify Trump’s ties to the Republican party indefinitely, essentially meaning any Republican candidate for the foreseeable future has to play along, embrace the pardon and I could see that playing out badly when they try to appeal to the general electorate when Trump inevitably cannot run again in 2028.

Thoughts? Rebuttals? Looking for some clarity here.

1i53y3p,"CMV: TikTok is deliberately suppressing anti-China content, and this is sufficient to justify banning the app.","I've seen a lot of posts about TikTok recently, but relatively few posts with sources, so I thought I'd throw my hat into the ring.  [This substack article](https://thezvi.substack.com/i/142559317/tiktok-promoting-chinese-interests) was what convinced me of my current views.  It's very long, but I'll focus this CMV on what is IMO the strongest point.

In December 2023, a think tank did a [study](https://networkcontagion.us/wp-content/uploads/A-Tik-Tok-ing-Timebomb_12.21.23.pdf) comparing how common different hashtags are on Instagram and TikTok.  Using ordinary political topics like Trump, Biden, BLM, MAGA, etc as a baseline, they found a few significant differences (page 8), but nothing that I don't think could be explained by selection effects.

On the other hand, when they looked at content related to China, [they found a rather different pattern:](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F429fa831-69e8-4faf-bf10-7925282c513c_1042x759.jpeg)

- Pro-Ukraine, pro-Uighur, and pro-Taiwan hashtags are about 10x less common on TikTok as they are on Instagram.
- Hashtags about Tibet are about 25x less common.
- Hashtags about [Hong Kong](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a2856f7-af25-4f08-91cd-fe9a43bf51af_978x1003.png) and Tianenmen Square are over 100x (!!) less common.
- Conversely, hashtags about Kashmir separatism in India are [~1000x *more* common.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51e2a055-b3f3-43f5-8430-f0192da03e97_974x227.png) 

I don't think you can explain this with selection bias.  Absent a coordinated effort from everyone who posts about Tianenmen Square to boycott TikTok, a 100x difference is *far* too large to occur naturally.  The cleanest explanation is that the CCP is requiring TikTok--a Chinese company that legally has to obey them--to tweak their algorithm to suppress views they don't like.

I think this justifies banning TikTok on its own.  Putting aside the other concerns (privacy, push notifications in a crisis, etc), the fact that an unfriendly foreign country is trying to influence US citizens' views via content manipulation--and not just on trivial stuff, on major political issues--is an enormous problem.  We wouldn't let Russia buy the New York Times, so why let China retain control over an app that over a third of all Americans use?

(I'm fully aware that the US government has pressured US social media companies about content before.  That said, if my only options are ""my government manipulates what I see"" and ""my government *and* an unfriendly government manipulate what I see"", I would prefer ""nobody manipulates what I see"" but would settle for the former if that's not an option.)

Here's a few possible ways you could change my view (note: if you can give me links or sources I will be much more likely to award deltas):

- Find major problems with the posted studies that make me doubt the results.
- Convince me that the bill is problematic enough that it's not worth passing even if TikTok *is* manipulating content.
- Show that the US is pressuring social media companies to suppress anti-US content on a similar scale (this wouldn't change my views about banning TikTok, but it would change my views about the US).
- Convince me that most of the bill's support in Congress comes from reasons other than content manipulation and privacy (you'll need a good argument for how strong the effect is, I already know that e.g. Meta has spent boatloads lobbying for this bill but I'm not sure how many votes this has bought them).

1i0ojk9,CMV: California's insurers are not 'greedy' for cancelling policy renewals,"**Myth #1:** ""They made all this money then just left!"" 

Tyler Perry (a billionaire) is pushing this rhetoric, stating recently: *""Does anyone else find it appalling that insurance companies can take billions of dollars out of communities for years and then, all of a sudden, be allowed to cancel millions of policies for the very people they became rich on?""*

The problem? In the last decade in California, for every $1.00 insurers have collected in premiums, they've paid out $1.09 in claims. Not only have they not made any money, they've suffered *heavy losses*. 

**Myth #2:** ""They're canceling these people's policies so they don't have to pay the claims!""

Outside of non-payment of premiums or fraud, California law prohibits insurers from canceling an insurance policy *during its term*. 

What they're canceling is the *renewal* of the policy. 

**Myth #3:** ""They're just *greedy*!"" 

* Over the past decade, the average combined ratio for the U.S. homeowners line was 101.3%, indicating insurers paid out more in claims than they received in premiums.

The last update in State Farm's wiki has their net revenue at a $5.5B *loss* (they're a prime target right now). Did they just forget to be greedy, then?

**Why did they cancel policies (renewals), refuse to take on more, and try to exit California altogether?** 

Because California made it impossible for them to function properly as an insurer. 

In 2017, voters passed a measure with support of the Newsom regime that heavily regulated the insurance industry under the guise of keeping home insurance ""affordable"". 

\- This required insurers to get approval from regulators before raising rates.   
\- They could only assess their rates based on historical losses in California, instead of forward-looking risk assessment  
\- California quickly became the worst state in the country for the disparity between actuary assessed rate (people who determine future risk and determine what premiums should be), and the regulatory approved rate.  
\- They delay for regulatory approval/rejection approached 300 days on average  
\- They were also prohibited (until very recently) from passing on the cost of reinsurance (insurance for insurance companies, basically) to customers. 

So the result was in effect the inability to function properly as an insurer, exposing themselves to catastrophic risk, and the necessity to pull out of these areas altogether less face bankruptcy. 

This has nothing to do with ""greed"". And if it does, the greed was on the part of Californians who thought they're too special to have to pay more for living in a disaster-prone area, and insurers should just be bending over backwards to lose money for their customer's benefit.

1hzwscm,CMV: American capitalism is severely flawed and exploitation of the working class is inherent to becoming a billionaire,"Throughout history, it has been evident that the capitalist economic philosophy of profit above all else, little/no government regulation, and letting the uber-rich hoard their incomprehensibly large amount of wealth is a leech on the well-being of society as a whole and leads to a constantly growing wealth divide not only within the scale of country, but on a global scale as well; a very clear divide between ""developed"" and ""less developed"" countries.

I can understand the philosophy behind the free market, having absolute equal distribution of wealth between everyone is ridiculous and creates stagnation in the development of a country. However, an unchecked wealth gap between the working and corporate/wealthy class creates turmoil and division amongst the people of a country. Throughout history, we can see that the uber-wealthy tend to use hatred against fellow people to distract the working class from who is really exploiting them; a scapegoat if you will. 

We can see in current day America that Donald Trump, a billionaire who is also endorsed by (and essentially a partner to) Elon Musk, the richest man on the planet, uses Mexican immigrants as a scapegoat for all the working man's troubles, Grocery prices, gas prices, inflation, etc, while creating tax cuts for the uber wealthy and killing welfare programs and departments, including the Department of Education. Despite the fact that deporting 10 million Mexican immigrants would cripple the American economy, the common working class white American believes it, simply because they are of a different culture and it is very easy to believe that they are the enemy because of human psychology.

The wealthy benefit from this because a working class that is too busy hating eachother is a working class that wont develop class consciousness. The billionaires will still cut corners at their companies and lobby to keep minimum wages stagnant as inflation slowly chips away at the value of the dollar, all while they grow wealthier. 

The unimaginable hoarding of wealth we see in the billionaire class is a cause for most of the economic troubles. There is no justification for one man to own as much wealth as millions of people while there are people who cant eat or drink. To be a billionaire, you must have exploitation at some point along the chain among at least one of their income streams, mainly their companies. Jeff Bezos is a prime example, a man acclaimed to have made his wealth ""by himself"", yet Amazon is notoriously one of the worst workplaces in the entire country for worker who make pennies to Bezos' millions.

I don't call for a total communist revolution within America, I just think that no person should have a billion dollars of wealth to their name no matter what they do as there's no reasonable justification for it that doesn't involve leeching off the working class. The corporate class should be taxed and regulated over ten-fold so that the capitol earned by the people is in the hands of the people.",itszesty0,322,0.6899999976158142,450,1736715517,2025-01-12 14:58:37,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hzwscm/cmv_american_capitalism_is_severely_flawed_and/,1,2025
1hyt4ya,CMV: the world is fucked and I'm all here for it.,"With openly fascist parties and demagogues rising to power worldwide and people voting against their interest time and time again, social media doing way more harm then good, I think this won't be get better, it will only get worse.

I'm not angry at greedy, powerhungry assholes doing greedy, powerhungry asshole things. I'm not angry at the snails eating the lettuce in my garden either. It's just what they do.

I'm angry at the substantial amount of bootlicking morons not being able to see behind the lies.

I'm angry at the moderate politicians thinking idealism will still get them anywhere after witnessing the effectiveness of extremist propaganda.

But that anger has slowly turned into apathy and actually sometimes recognition.

I catch myself more and more often thinking: ""So y'all wanna get fucked? Ok let's fucking go! Let's see how bad it can really get.""

And this sentiment is seeming to get stronger.

1i9i8mj,"CMV: Without radical change, the Democratic Party will functionally cease to exist before 2040.","This view has one argument behind it: once solid Democratic voting blocs have steadily turned against them. 

From 1980 to 2012, the Latino vote has, with only two exceptions, been over 60% Democrat, usually a victory by 20+ points. Harris won the Latino vote by 5. This isn’t an anomaly either, it’s not Harris being deeply unpopular. It’s a downward trend taking place since 2008. (And probably further back, if you don’t count the outlier of Kerry v. Bush, where Latinos voted conservative at levels roughly equivalent to 2024.)

The same is largely true among black voters. From 95+% during the Obama years, with a steadily decreasing lead since then, black voters seem to be shifting rightward. Even if you consider the Obama years to be an anomaly, which I suppose they are, but not an outlier, the shift is dramatic. Harris won the black vote, despite being black herself, by the smallest margin in the last thirty years at least, and almost certainly more. This is also part of a continuous downward trend. Since Obama, they’ve voted less consistently Democrat than expected. 

If these trends continue, and I think they will, the Democratic Party will functionally cease to exist. They don’t even need to continue far. If they slip a few points more among black voters, that’s *it.*

I haven’t seen anyone talking about this. Sure, people have talked about the Latino vote going more red than expected or Trump making minor gains among black men, but no one seems to have acknowledged that these are *trends* that the Democratic Party will not survive continuing. Is there some glaring flaw in my logic? Or is there a deep panic going on behind closed doors?

1ibg3w9,CMV: States whose senators vote against federal funding packages should not receive federal funds.,"I’m a frustrated democrat in the US. Time and again, I will see Republicans tout all the federal funding their states are getting from bills like the CHIPs act, the IRA, or the infrastructure bill yet their voting record aggressively opposed passing any of that legislation. 

They don’t deserve it. Their states don’t deserve the funding that they clearly don’t ideologically support. 

I believe that if you’re a senator and you do not vote to pass a bill that assigns federal funds for improvement, you do not deserve the benefits of that improvement. Hell, I could be convinced that states that voted against the ACA don’t deserve the same healthcare protections. 

I can understand that many people in red states do not vote for the R candidate and they would suffer if this were followed. I don’t know that that matters. We’re in a representative democracy and if the majority of constituents don’t want federal funding, they shouldn’t be rewarded.

1ich3nu,"CMV: Waffles are strictly better than pancakes, and if you have the option to have either, there’s no reason to choose pancakes.","Pancakes are good. Waffles are simply better. Even low grade waffle mix cooked through is crispy on the outside, but fluffy, and spongy on the inside. Pancakes, on the other hand, can turn out rubbery, flavorless, and seemingly cooked on the outside while being raw on the inside. Even when both are properly cooked, waffles have a perfect blend of crispy and fluffy, whereas pancakes are _usually_ either one or the other. Additionally, syrup just slides off pancakes and you end up getting pools of it on your planet, whereas waffles hold and absorb the syrup, giving you glorious pockets of syrup in every bite. All of the benefits of waffles get even better when you make Belgian waffles. They’re so thick, fluffy, crispy, and two of them is a delightful feast. 

To me, this isn’t a vanilla vs chocolate ice cream comparison, because despite generally liking chocolate ice cream more than vanilla, I sometimes want vanilla ice cream. This is more like good ice cream vs better ice cream. You’re not going to pick the good ice cream if you can pick the better ice cream. When given the option, I will pick waffles 100% of the time. Anything pancakes do, waffles do better.

1hz98ck,CMV: corporate lobbying should be a heavily restricted activity and corporations should have no say in politics. ,"Im posting this because i know someone here will enlighten me on why it is actually not directly harmful to a society for non human entities with non human interests to have a say in lawmaking and politics.  

I don’t see why it makes sense for a corporation to have a direct say in policy making in a democracy. A business owner himself may have interests and employees may have interests and they should on behalf of themselves have a say but a corporation sending lobbyists to do whatever magic it is that they do to sway politicians to do one thing or another doesn’t make sense to me if the governments chief concern is the people who vote/citizens. 

Enabling business entities to lobby officials on their behalf which inevitably is in the interest of profit seems like it compromises a politicians dedication to the people. Politicians are people after all and can be swayed , i think it makes sense to lessen the amount of possible swayers who are not the people governed. 

The lobbying and the exorbitant funding of these campaigns clearly sways the public officials interests a bit further to the interest of  private ownership benefit than i care for. It seems like it has produced an environment where the people are in a battle with corporate interests . 

The business entities seem to function as incredibly powerful super voters who have an advantage over the very group governments are supposed to function for. The government is feeling more and more like a privately owned interest group for business entities and less like a public good chiefly concerned with the people. 

Am i being a doomer? Am i mistaken somewhere? Let me know.

1htrerd,CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment. ,"Yes its price has increased dramatically, but so did the price of tulips in the 1600s.

There is literally no use for this commodity. Invest in stocks or bonds and your investing in future earnings or the ability of a company to pay you back. I’m not a fan of gold as an investment but at least it has some practical use.

The use of crypto as a currency completely defies the definition of currency as it doesn’t hold a stable value.

It’s infuriating that so many people have lost loads of money on “shitcoins” backed by the wealthy and famous. These were obviously pump and dump schemes yet very few are held accountable.

I’m not as well versed on the subject but something to also note is the ridiculous amount of energy demand to “mine” nothing. 

I think there is legitimate use for blockchain technology and the likes but anyone viewing these currencies as investments is a fool.",art_vandelay112,282,0.7799999713897705,535,1736032855,2025-01-04 17:20:55,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1htrerd/cmv_cryptocurrency_is_not_a_good_investment/,1,2025
1i54zz4,"CMV: People who believe in tarot readings, physics etc are really gullible and stupid ","Physics, tarot readers, mediums etc are all charlatans who con people out of money.
The people they con are usually grieving soma death or in a bad mental space so they subconsciously want to believe the generic nonsense these scammers provide them.


If someone could actually talk to the dead (or dogs, believe me there are people who claim this too) then they would do it for free right?

But instead they charge plenty of money to spread complete lies.

I chatted to someone last night who said ""when my father died last year like 4 days after it I went to a medium and they told me that my father forgives me for working so much""


Like this is such generic and easy bullshit to say to convince a gullible person.

I'm aware some of these people are simply delusional and believe that they actually can do this ( I have friend who's sister believes and I actually believe that she believes) but the majority of these people know they are lying and know they are acting immoral and unethical.

If you truly believe in any of this stuff, to me, you're extremely stupid.

1i9zyoz,CMV: Trump politics is really about high school social dynamics,"As a Gen X, I remember the distinct social classes in a typical suburban high school where everyone knew their place in the hierarchy.   It was always the good looking kids at the top and didn't matter even if they were dumb as a rock.   It always helped if they were good at sports, excelled at fighting, or could tell funny jokes.  More times than not, the smart kids were on the lower tiers and didn't get invited to many parties.  But one thing you could not be was to be weird.  ""Weird"" meant many things during this stage during this time in our lives.  Being gay definitely qualifies for that label that gave people permission to bully them.  We also didn't understand mental illness, and many kids picked on the weird kids who were obviously struggling to get by.  The lowest of the low were probably the non-English speaking immigrant kids that were virtually invisible.

And then I went off to college and got married and yadi yada.  But the thing that has been shocking in hindsight is how upside down the social heirarchy of the general society in the last 30 to 40 years has been turned upside down from my old high school days.  The relative standing of those people that were deemed so weird back then now seem so much more accepted in society.   Those smart kids went on to become tech CEOs, doctors, lawyers, and engineers.   You may get cancelled or fired if you say the wrong thing about those same weird people now.   Those immigrants kids seem to be doing even better than you.  

Some of those popular kids in high school I knew are now Trump supporters.   They are not as good looking as when they were in high school and they are struggling financially.  So they are disgruntled.   Trump is a way for people to fix the social heirarchy to Make America Great Again. CMV.
