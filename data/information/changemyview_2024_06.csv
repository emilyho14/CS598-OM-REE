1dh7wsx,CMV: Asians and Whites should not have to score higher on the MCAT to get into medical school,"Here’s the problem:

White applicants matriculate with a mean MCAT score of 512.4. This means, on average, a White applicant to med school needs a 512.4 MCAT score to get accepted.

Asian applicants are even higher, with a mean matriculation score of 514.3. For reference, this is around a 90th percentile MCAT score.

On the other hand, Black applicants matriculate with a mean score of 505.7. This is around a 65th percentile MCAT score. Hispanics are at 506.4.

This is a problem directly relevant to patient care. If you doubt this, I can go into the association between MCAT and USMLE exams, as well as fail and dropout rates at diversity-focused schools (which may further contribute to the physician shortage).

Of course, there are many benefits of increasing physician diversity. However, I believe in a field where human lives are at stake, we should not trade potential expertise for racial diversity.",Excellent_Walrus3532,2432,0.8100000023841858,1247,1718545524,2024-06-16 08:45:24,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dh7wsx/cmv_asians_and_whites_should_not_have_to_score/,6,2024
1dcajfe,"CMV: There is no reason to ever allow ""religious exemptions"" from anything. They shouldn't exist.","The premise here being that, if it's okay for one person to ignore a rule, then it should be okay for everyone regardless of their deeply held convictions about it. And if it's a rule that most people can't break, then simply having a strong spiritual opinion about it shouldn't mean the rule doesn't exist for you.

Examples: Either wearing a hat for a Driver's License is not okay, or it is. Either having a beard hinders your ability to do the job, or it doesn't. Either you can use a space for quiet reflection, or you can't. Either you can't wear a face covering, or you can. Either you can sign off on all wedding licenses, or you can't.

I can see the need for specific religious buildings where you must adhere to their standards privately or not be welcome. But like, for example, a restaurant has a dress code and if your religion says you can't dress like that, then your religion is telling you that you can't have that job. Don't get a job at a butcher if you can't touch meat, etc.


Changing my view: Any example of any reason that any rule should exist for everyone, except for those who have a religious objection to it.

1d8511u,"CMV: Marrying someone who is straight, while you yourself are gay and hiding it, makes you a horrible person.","Over the years I've watched or heard, of stories involving gay partners coming out further along in life after marriage. 

If you know you are gay and you commit to a heterosexual relationship without conveying that information to your partner, you are a liar and a genuinely horrible person. Both to yourself and your partner.

I would like to clarify that in this post I am strictly speaking about people that know they are gay BEFORE they commit to marriage. If you find out your sexuality later on in life, that's unfortunate for the other person but not your fault.

The single most important factor in a healthy relationship is trust. Withholding something as significant as, ""not being attracted to your partner"" is the ultimate level of betrayel.

Being born into an anti-LGBTQ+ family is not an exception. You have a moral obligation to not marry someone who is hetero and distance yourself from your family. I know that sounds harsh but that's how I feel.

A really popular show that addressed this was, ""Grace and Frankie"". A Netflix series about two middle aged women finding out their husband's have been together for the majority of their marriages and the fallout afterwards. 

On twitter I saw that people really liked both the gay husband's but I just couldn't bring myself to. When I looked at them I felt anger and frustration that they would do something so backhanded and disrespectful to their partners. In the show they even said they, ""loved them"" but you don't lie to someone you love for 30+.

1d614o5,"CMV: People are treating mental disorders like they’re zodiac signs or personality tests. It’s dangerous and weird, but it’s the price we pay for lowering the stigma around mental illness.","I have ADD. I was diagnosed as a child and I’ve lived with it for most of my life. My mother has issues with anxiety, depression, and hoarding. My sisters struggle with the former two. None of us, however, *identify* with our illnesses to the extent that we turn it into a personality trait. We’re shaped by it but we are not *it*. This is where I think there’s a problem today. People are becoming tribal around the ideas of mental illness. Autism, ADHD, Bipolar, Anxiety, Tourettes, the more the concepts and language of academic psychology and psychiatry bleed into everyday life, the more people are going to construct their identities around it.

But I don’t think that’s healthy. I’m sure there will be plenty of people who respond to this who will say they’ve found community, connection and understanding through meeting/talking to others who share their illness. But when something as expansive yet also nebulous as mental illness is gets boiled down to 30 second tiktok video, we’re risking over expanding the definitions of illness so that they’re otherwise meaningless. Take a look at r/adhd for example. I’m a member of that group but I don’t frequent it often because the sheer amount of things people attribute to their ADD is ridiculous. People fail to understand the difference between correlation and causation and as a result we get posts like “I don’t like eating cake. DAE struggle with eating cake as an ADHDer??”

That’s a crude parody but it gets my point across. People are associating things to mental illness that are just normal human likes/dislikes. Yes, people don’t like doing laundry or brushing/flossing their teeth. Nobody, unless you love the sensation of floss on gum, enjoys doing chores. That’s why they’re called chores. If they were fun to do we’d call them “fun tasks”. But associating the dislike of chores as something inherent to ADHD is silly but when you take an idea like that, throw it into a lively internet community and combine it with the human desire to understand themselves or find a roadmap to building an identity you begin to the same “trait” adopted by others.

Most “neurodivergent” brains show no major differences from other humans brains. There are no “depression fingerprints” on the brain that allow people to identify a brain that has depression from a brain that doesn’t. The same principle applies to all other mental illnesses. It differs from person to person to person who are in turned shaped by their family, culture, and upbringing. But people want that roadmap so they’ll flatten that wide expanse into a flat binary of “ADHD” and “NON-ADHD”. Take the DSM for example, they tried to eliminate the diagnosis of aspergers and combine it with autism if I remember correctly but when people who’d identified as being “ASPIES” found out, they howled in protest at their erasure.

But, unfortunately, I don’t think there’s anyway to avoid this. The more we talk about something, the more we lower the barrier for entry. The more we lower the barrier, the more people can glom onto it for identity building. Kind of like the kids who, when I was a young, would fake cut marks on themselves to seem edgy and for personality fodder. But now we get it for every mental illness imaginable. To add a final point to this, I think the minute we start making other people’s symptoms iron laws for our own personalities is the minute we begin to limit and create reasons for why we “can’t” do something. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

We constantly talk about how much trauma there is in the world, how easy it is to be traumatized, how sensitive we have to be to other people’s trauma and how trauma trauma trauma can be and now we have high schoolers and middle schoolers claiming they have PTSD at rates combat veterans don’t have. Maybe some of them do, but I don’t think kids in the United States have it harder or that their classmates are any crueler then their grandparents generation before them. Or even my generation now.

This is an extremely unhealthy mindset for your social life.","So many relationship subs tell anyone who has an issue with someone to just leave and never see them again despite how serious the issue may be.

Humans are not perfect all the time. Eventually someone you love will hurt you by accident or by ignorance. Assuming it’s nothing dangerous, you can most likely talk it out with them. 

If someone has a behavior that violates your boundaries, there’s no problem with talking about it with them in a way that asserts yourself while saving your connection with them. Sometimes people aren’t even aware you are hurt. People can’t read minds.

Leaving everyone at the slightest problem prevents you from not only deepening relationships (since you will always be on the lookout for red flags and won’t enjoy your time with them, it’s kind of a self fulfilling prophecy), but also is not fair to the other person.

Now, the same could be said about any new player entering a league including men like LeBron, however the common notion and argument I hear is that the only haters and people trying to bring Caitlin Clark down are the men, which is hard to believe given that nearly every big name in the nba has had nothing but positivity towards Caitlin Clark.  A big reason why the wnba exists is to provide an outlet that supports, recognizes, and accomplishments in women's basketball.

1dhbumr,"CMV: Small penis jokes deliberately emotionally hurt all people with small penises, not just their intended target.","Whether it’s “small dick energy” or “compensating for something” or “mushroom dick” or any other insult, I genuinely do not believe it is possible to make a small penis joke without deliberately targeting everyone with a small penis at once, even if the intended target is a misogynistic, bullying, egocentric jerk.

Simply put, these jokes imply that having a small penis is a very bad thing. That it automatically makes you a disgusting, sexist, egocentric loser. The people who make these jokes claim people with small penises must all be insecure, but then deliberately use this humour to cause that insecurity and alienate. It’s like hitting someone and then making fun of them for being in pain. They want you to be insecure and then use jokes to highlight that insecurity.

This concept must be foreign to a lot of people because it actually is possible to be a decent human being with a small penis, but these jokes imply otherwise and are designed to make people conflate small penises with being a vile, woman-hating, insecure, vain prick. Those who make them clearly do not care if they emotionally hurt normal people with small penises, and when we call out their body shaming, that’s when they say “See? You’re insecure! Lol you have small dick energy!” We aren’t defending the intended targets of these jokes, we are defending ourselves because we aren’t like the people they are targeting.

1di89d8,CMV: There is no moral justification for not voting Biden in the upcoming US elections if you believe Trump and Project 2025 will turn the US into a fascistic hellscape,"I've seen a lot of people on the left saying they won't vote for Biden because he supports genocide or for any number of other reasons. I don't think a lot of people are fond of Biden, including myself, but to believe Trump and Project 2025 will usher in fascism and not vote for the only candidate who has a chance at defeating him is mind blowing. 

It's not as though Trump will stand up for Palestinians. He tried to push through a Muslim ban, declared himself King of the Israeli people, and the organizations behind project 2025 are supportive of Israel. So it's a question of supporting genocide+ fascism or supporting genocide. From every moral standpoint I'm aware of, the moral choice is clear.

1dek023,CMV: People shouldn't vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election because he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election,"Pretty simple opinion here. 

Donald Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. That's not just the Jan 6 riot, it's his efforts to submit fake electors, have legislatures overturn results, have Congress overturn results, have the VP refuse to read the ballots for certain states, and have Governors find fake votes. 

This was bad because the results weren't fraudulent. A House investigation, a Senate investigation, a DOJ investigation, various courts, etc all have examined this extensively and found the results weren't fraudulent.

So Trump effectively tried to overthrow the government. Biden was elected president and he wanted to take the power of the presidency away from Biden, and keep it himself. If he knew the results weren't fraudulent, and he did this, that would make him evil. If he genuinely the results were fraudulent, without any evidence supporting that, that would make him dangerously idiotic. Either way, he shouldn't be allowed to have power back because it is bad for a country to have either an evil or dangerously idiotic leader at the helm.

1ddowi7,CMV: The Hunter Biden Case Has Virtually No Bearing on Biden's Suitability as President,"After reading the New York Times' reporting, there seems to be a  consensus among reporters that this verdict will weigh heavily  against President Biden. I'm sincerely confused as to why that would be the case though because: 

1. Hunter Biden is not running for President.
2. Hunter Biden is a 50-something year-old man who presumably made his own choices. It's not like this was the case of a minor where the parents are ultimately responsible for his behavior. 
3. Hunter Biden does not write the President's policies, domestic or international. His conviction has no bearing on how President Biden will govern, set policy, make his budget, etc.  
4. President Biden has been convicted of nothing, charged with nothing. 
5. Donald Trump is literally a convicted felon. Shouldn't being a felon be worse for a campaign than being related to a felon?

Given those reasons, why is the Hunter Biden case even an issue? Most Americans are related or know someone personally that has a drug problem, and people who are in the midst of their drug issues are generally not known to be the best law-abiding citizens.

1ds7o2a,CMV: we should stop using “people of color” when referring to anyone who isn’t “white”.,"I think that the term “person of color” is actually not just unnecessary, but also offensive.

And even though I’m white, it does make my skin crawl whenever I hear it because it’s basically one step away from the 1950’s, calling someone a “colored person”.

When people say “person of color”, they’re basically just saying that “person” by itself means white.

And I also think we should stop saying African-American (or even Asian-American) because they have been in this country for as long as white people have. If we continue saying those terms, we might as well call white people “European-American” and call actual Native Americans just “American”.

People don’t call Dutch or Belgians who have been here since 1870’s “Belgian-American” or “Dutch-American”. So why should we call black people who have been here since the 18th century “African-American” when they are just as American as the rest of us?

1d9l0gl,"CMV: Not returning your shopping cart or at least putting it somewhere secure (e.g., on the curb) is incredibly selfish and entitled behavior. Yes, even if you are a parent.","I am a parent of two very energetic young kids who, like most kids, would happily walk into traffic if I wasn’t holding their hands.

Recently there was a viral video of a woman who went on a long diatribe on why she doesn’t return shopping carts and implied that society asking parents to do so is unreasonable.

I think she’s being incredibly selfish and privileged. There are lots of parents out there, and if all of them followed her example, parking lots would become *much* more chaotic and dangerous places for cars and pedestrians alike.

Here are my very simple instructions for her: Put your kids in their car seats (or lock them in the car if they aren’t in car seats), pump the A/C if it’s too hot, and then take the 15-20 seconds to return the cart. There will always be edge cases like emergencies, people with special needs and not feeling safe if it’s an isolated parking lot, but to not return a cart as a matter of course is just wrong. If you do just a few seconds of planning it’s not that hard. I know because I do it nearly every day, by myself with two crazy kids in tow. I’ve never even considered not returning the cart unless I truly couldn’t, and then I’ll make sure it’s on a curb or something so it doesn’t roll away.

1dbv1el,CMV: The latest IDF raid to rescue four hostages debunks the “targeted operation” myth,"In the Gaza War, the IDF recently rescued four hostages. The operation was brutal, with Hamas fighters fighting to the death to prevent the hostages from being rescued, and civilians caught in the crossfire. Hundreds of civilians died and Israel was able to rescue four hostages. Assuming the 275 civilian death number is accurate, you get an average of 68.75 Palestinian civilians killed for every Israeli hostage recovered. 

This strongly debunks the myth of the so called “targeted operation war” that many on Reddit call for. Proponents say Israel should not bomb buildings that may contain or conceal terrorist infrastructure, instead launching targeted ground operations to kill Hamas terrorists and recover hostages. This latest raid shows why that just isn’t practical. Assuming the civilian death to hostage recovered ratio remains similar to this operation, over 17,000 Palestinian civilians would be killed in recovering hostages, let alone killing every Hamas fighter. 

Hamas is unabashed in their willingness to hide behind their civilians. No matter what strategy Israel uses in this war, civilians will continue to die. This operation is yet more evidence that the civilian deaths are the fault of Hamas, not Israel, and that a practical alternative strategy that does not involve civilian deaths is impractical.

1djs0n8,CMV: Just Stop Oil is a strong net negative for the climate action movement,"A few minutes ago, I saw a video of Just Stop Oil painting Stonehenge with some sort of orange paint. This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it keeps escalating.

I believe that their organization is a significant net negative for the climate cause. They are so counterproductive that it seems like they must be paid actors installed by the oil industry.

I personally support climate action. However, many people around me, especially the older ones, are quite undecided. Every time Just Stop Oil commits an act of vandalism, they become more opposed to the cause because they dislike the activists advocating for it.

I also believe that gatherings and demonstrations are a great way to show discontent to the government. However, I would feel really uncomfortable attending a climate march with groups like Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion, as they escalate the protests and create conflicts with the police. I once experienced this firsthand and felt quite uncomfortable. As a result, I am less likely to participate again. I am sure many others feel the same way.

In my opinion, they also greatly harm the climate movement by pushing other causes under the guise of climate action. For example, by protesting against Israel as an organization, they strongly reinforce the narrative that climate activists do not actually care about the climate but are merely leftists promoting their political goals. This again turns away potential supporters of the cause.

1dmusxt,CMV: Falling birthrates are actually the best news we've seen in decades.,"The world, simply put, does not need more humans. We should be trying to improve life for the people who are already here, and to minimize our negative ecological effects. 

Right now, there is so much human life, in fact, that our society gives it no value; it allows children born in Africa—who might have the talents of Shakespeare or Einstein, but we'll never know—to die of preventable diseases because, contrary to this ruling-class gaslighting narrative of a ""labor shortage"", there is a global labor *overage*, which is why conditions for ordinary people are so atrocious. If we weren't grossly overpopulated, capital would have so little power, relative to labor, that we wouldn't even need a ""revolution"" against capitalism, because jobs would be competing for workers rather than the reverse.

At the same time, we exist under an economic system and at a primitive-enough technological level (still reliant on fossil fuels, for example) that we damage the planet irreparably for every year we exist in this state. If the birthrate drops precipitously and the population declines, we slow down capitalism's damage, giving us a chance of still having some semblance of a livable planet when we move beyond it.

The fertility collapse of educated people is one of workers using the one vote they have to speak out on the system, the prospects it has given then, and the opportunities their children would have if they existed. This movement toward voluntary childlessness isn't some epidemic of antisocial behavior; it is an outbreak of rationality and compassion. If we keep populating, we persist in a state of congestion wherein human life is assigned such a low value, our societies become terrible places to live. If we stop, on the other hand, we give the species a fighting chance. Voluntary depopulation might also be the only nonviolent way to overthrow capitalism and set us up to create something better when it finally collapses.

Don't get me wrong. Some of the reasons why birthrates are dropping are horrendous. Korean work culture and European stagnation and American inopportunity are not good things. Social isolation and involuntary celibacy (which, I suspect, afflicts many women as much as men) are signs of severe rot in our culture, and we should try to fix those problems. Not all contributors to the declining birthrates are good; some of these are serious issues that deserve address. Still, the fact itself of a negative net birth rate is something that all of us should be celebrating.",michaelochurch,675,0.6499999761581421,514,1719172825,2024-06-23 15:00:25,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dmusxt/cmv_falling_birthrates_are_actually_the_best_news/,6,2024

I am also aware of a sexuality being a spectrum, strictly bi/hetero/homosexual isn't very common here and sexuality of everyone should be respected, always.

But the peoblem is the term ""bisexual lesbian"" sounds quite mutually exclusive, lesbians aren't attracted to men, and it can invite creeps, perverts, MGTOW-ers, redpills and incels thinking they can get any woman and girl they want, regardless of of the women's sexuality and their boundaries.

1drtg6g,CMV: The worst thing the DNC can do right now is nothing.,"The way I see it, there’s three scenarios, but only two are likely.

The first is what I consider the most likely, it’s the thought that inspired this post, and is by far the worst outcome for the DNC. They wait NC (get it?). Biden’s polling numbers don’t recover enough, and, as November approaches, they realize he isn’t going to win, panic, get Biden to step down, and announce a replacement. With a few weeks or a month or two to campaign, they aren’t able to shake Harris’ deep unpopularity and lose. Or,l they go with a different candidate, don’t get their name out enough because they’re short on time, and they lose.

The second is that they do nothing. It’s the second of the two scenarios that inspired this post. They pretend it didn’t happen, continue as before, and run Biden against Trump in a 2020 rematch. Biden, who wasn’t certain to beat Trump before, at the height of his unpopularity, runs amid his low rating, doubts about his mental ability, calls to step down from his own party, and (at least the perception of) a shaky economy and high prices. He loses.

The third, and the least likely, is the winning scenario. The DNC acts now gets Biden to step down, replaces him with a younger, more virile candidate, and all of trump’s doubtful supporters flock to the younger alternative. With the benefit of three months of vigorous campaigning, they take the win.

There is technically a fourth scenario. The fallout from the debate is minimal, Biden runs normally and defeats Trump. If this was likely, we wouldn’t be hearing calls for him to step aside from his own party and from major media outlets.",Separate_Draft4887,484,0.6600000262260437,1129,1719721951,2024-06-29 23:32:31,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1drtg6g/cmv_the_worst_thing_the_dnc_can_do_right_now_is/,6,2024

1d90fx9,CMV: Arabs never criticize other Arab countries. However when it comes to Israel it's the polar opposite.,"First off I'm not posting this to shill an agenda in favor of anyone, I will try to be as apolitical as possible.

As someone who has a North African heritage. Most of my family members hold strong grudges against Israel. But I didn't see any signs of grievance or complaints when other Arab leaders/countries do some sorts of violations. And it's not just my family plenty of Arabs in the Arab world keep their mouth shut when it's another Arab but when it's Israel it's the complete opposite.

Just for context, here's a list of violations and mistreatment Arab countries have done:

\- Al-Assad regime killing his own civilians during the civil war and the casualty count trample the one seen in Gaza. The regime literally used chemical weapons against its own citizens.

\- The Saddam regime in 1). Invading Iran (with the help of the west) in a brutal war where some wild warfare practices were used. 2). Invading Kuwait. 3) Repressing his own citizens and especially Shi'ites and Kurds minorities (Yes I know that Iranians and Kurds in other countries protested Saddam) but the Sunni's in other Arab countries just kept silent.

\- Speaking of Kuwait? How many of you knew that there are actually people indigenous to Kuwait and the government refuse to grant citizenship to. [The bedoon of Kuwait as documented here](https://bit.ly/3yHhhbh). Why don't Arabs protest for their self-determination like they do for Palestinians?

\- The countless Human Rights violations in the Gulf countries starting from the Kafala system (that Qatar rightly abolished after plenty of FOREIGN complaints) to the numerous inequalities women face. I can go on forever here

\- The war in Yemen that caused the biggest massive humanitarian crisis and was instigated by both Saudi Arabia and Iran, again no massive protests was seen in the Arab world to reach a ceasefire.

It seems to me that the only consistent thing here is that when the aggressor is not Arab/Muslim the protests are massively launched, even though Arabs have violated themselves to an arguably greater degree.

Another thing noticed inside the Arab discourse is that the holocaust existence is taken with suspicion and never embraced, same with the Armenian Genocide. Compare this with the war in Gaza where in most mainstream discourse it is referred as an unfettered genocide in Gaza.

Tell me in one instance a sizeable group of Arabs disapproved another Arab country/leader for a particular violation. I'm not talking about government officials, I will change my view if this instance pertained considerable members from society.",holamifuturo,442,0.6600000262260437,337,1717620454,2024-06-05 15:47:34,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d90fx9/cmv_arabs_never_criticize_other_arab_countries/,6,2024

1dkd43z,CMV: Most of the hype surrounding AI massively misunderstands how it works and its resulting limitations,"We are currently living in what seems to be an AI hype bubble, with much of the current stock market being devoted to frenzied hype around ‘AI’. However, I believe that none of the people throwing money after this have any idea how AI actually works, and are going to be in for a rude awakening once they realise they are not going to get anywhere near the expected returns on their investments. Furthermore, even those that acknowledge the existence of a bubble seem to do so in ways that have no relation to the fundamental mechanisms of ‘AI’ (defined here as the sorts of generative AI popularised by ChatGPT and hyped up by the current tech industry). This is an attempt to change that.

As far as I can see, there are three main problems with how AI works. Firstly, the ‘ouroboros’ problem, whereby AI ends up consuming a load of its own content and the quality of outputs decrease - this seems to be one of the most popularly states arguments against AI, and won’t be the focus of my argument. Secondly, there’s the problem of small datasets - a lot of problems concern rather niche areas in which there is comparatively little data and literature on - thus will dramatically undermine AI’s ability to deal with these problems and the quality of its inferences will be significantly worse. This I believe is a more significant argument, and definitely plays into my belief that AI is about to plateau.

However, the main one is as follows: to my knowledge, most of the current innovation in AI is in processes that are essentially just super fancy ways of smashing the middle button of predictive text, albeit on more of a sentence and paragraph level. AI models are fed extremely large amounts of data, and essentially spit out the ‘statistical average’ of said dataset based on a given prompt. Because of the way human language works, so long as your dataset is large enough and the statistical models are good enough, this can approximate human speech and knowledge pretty well. However, at no point during this process does the AI ever ‘understand’ any of what it writes. It is able to approximate understanding by using contextual statistical models, but it isn’t able to translate any of it into actual actions that interact with the real world (or at least, no additional progress has been made).

To use an analogy based on the famous Chinese room thought experiment, imagine an English-speaking man in an enclosed room, who does not speak a word of Chinese. While in that room, he is able to find an enormous library of books written entirely in Chinese, with no English translations. He does not understand a word of it, but as he reads through, he begins to notice patterns, where in certain contexts certain characters are more likely to occur after certain other characters and symbols. He reads more and more through the books, and is eventually able to put together a rough model for the continuous patterns he finds. Now, if someone were to post a conversational message in Chinese, he would be able to ‘respond’ in a roughly accurate way (being more accurate the more books he has on the subject and the better his pattern identifying skills). However, if they were to post him an instruction (eg pass me one of your books), he would be no more capable of being able to carry it out than before he read through the pile of books, as he has no way of being able to relate the characters he sees to actual meaning. To use the more traditional Chinese Room set up, there are instructions on the wall for drawing symbols, but none for performing actions. 

This is essentially my understanding of where AI is at - there have been significant advances in providing the pile of books, and in being able to spot patterns within them, however AI is no better at being able to relate its outputs to reality than it was before the ‘explosion’ (and quite often, there are very few books on the subject they are being asked about). That doesn’t necessarily mean that it can’t, but it means that this aspect has to be done ‘manually’ by humans in a way that has not benefited from recent advances. The problem is, this bit is both the useful bit and the difficult bit. Attempting to translate human language into consistent actionable inputs is exceptionally difficult outside of certain environments - there are arguably entire disciplines such as philosophy and cognitive language theory devoted to it (part of the reason why ChatGPT is so successful is that it deliberately avoids doing it, instead focusing on pure statistics). 

However, if you can’t do this, then you essentially end up with an AI almost entirely incapable of interacting with its environment, and it is precisely this form of interaction that most people expect when it comes to AI. To use another example, customer service is an area many people consider to be obsolete following AI. Certainly I can see that an AI can replicate the advice side of things (“Have you tried switching it off and on again etc”), but as soon as you arrive at a situation in which action needs to be taken (eg something’s gone wrong with a purchase), an AI will be either almost entirely useless at solving it, or be stuck with incredibly simplistic responses such as providing refunds. This may change in future, but there is nothing in the current ‘AI revolution’ that has brought us any a closer to this. 

As it stands then, we have a large group of people hurling money at AI hoping it will change the world, without realising that it is barely even capable of interacting with it and certainly not with any niche, difficult areas. This seems a perfect recipe for a dot com style bust. 

This isn’t exactly the most heartening conclusion, and I’m no computer scientist, so it’s entirely possible my understanding of the mechanisms of AI is incorrect.

1dovp7x,"CMV: Not shooting Vladimir Makarov and his gang during ""No Russian"" in MW2 (2009) is one of the dumbest plot holes in video gaming history.","In the mission, you are walking behind Vladimir and his 3 men who are all not wearing any armor for, or protection on, their heads. They do not watch you. They do not even care if you never pull the trigger to kill civilians in the mission. PFC Joseph Allen could have easily shot and killed them all. He had an LMG with plenty of ammo, and was obviously trained in the military to where he could have handled it well. Makarov is even the one closest to you!!

The in universe reason given by Shepherd to Allen as to why Allen is going in to even do this is, and I quote directly from the game, ""It will cost you a piece of yourself. It will cost nothing compared to everything you'll save.""

In no world was any of the potential info that could have possibly been gained by staying in Makarov's circle been worth more than just killing Makarov on the spot. There was a prime opportunity to do what they've always wanted to do and bad/ignorant writing is the only thing that stopped it. 

I cannot think of any valid in universe reasons as to why Allen could not have shot at least just Makarov. In what world does a common-man military member (who is literally one step above private, which means he basically just completed boot camp) not stop the killing of literally hundreds, if not thousands of innocent people, let alone he actively participates in it???

I would have no issue with this if literally ANY coherent reason was given as to why it could not be done. Here's a few things that weren't written into the game, but if they were written in, it wouldn't be a plothole:

1. Makarov and gang is in full bulletproof outfits, obviously not allowing them to be fragged. This is just a character design change. Wouldn't have even needed to record dialog. 

2. Allen is forced to be in front as they don't trust the new guy, so he has to prove himself. You would be shot if you attempt to look at them with your gun, for example. 

3. The airport massacre and kill numbers weren't supposed to be anywhere close to this bad, in the eyes of Shepherd/America anyway. Whether this be because the target was unknown, or something else. 

4. There was someone above Makarov who they wanted, that successfully doing this would have lead them to.

1d8ys0n,"CMV: The popular refrain in American politics that ""both sides are equally bad"" is really just a refuge-seeking device for conservatives who are embarrassed by the GOP but plan to vote for them anyway","You hear some variation of this all the time when engaging in political discussion:

- Both sides suck;

- All politicians are crooks and cannot be trusted / I hate all politicians;

- The whole system is broken and needs to go;

- Etc. 

However, I've yet to come across someone who says this and votes liberal / Dem. It's ALWAYS people who vote GOP / conservative saying this. After all, if it were actually true, you'd see more of a 50/50 split among people who say this and the way they actually vote. 

A careful distinction is the word ""equally"" - the premise held by utterers of this phrase is that both sides are THE SAME level of bad; that they're six of one / half dozen of the other. In other words, this would not account for someone saying something like ""yes, the Democrats are far from perfect and have their issues, but their awfulness does not begin to approach the awfulness of the GOP."" In that way, someone is saying ""both parties have their flaws, but they are not *EQUALLY* bad."" 

My theory is this line of reasoning is merely refuge-seeking for the minority of well-adjusted people who recognize that Trump is a uniquely horrible human being, and that many GOP policy positions are reactionary and retrograde, but for whatever reason (the way they were brought up, peer pressure, their financial position, etc.) nevertheless are looking for a way to rationalize and justify their decision to continue voting for Republicans. If you can convince yourself that the other side is ""equally bad"", then it causes less cognitive dissonance & shame & embarrassment when you ultimately pull the lever for the side that's demonstrably worse.

1dckxpx,"CMV: In the context of American politics, the term “assault weapon” is poorly defined and the proposed “assault weapon bans” will have little to no effect on crime.","The term “assault weapon” does not have a generally agreed upon definition but in practice it seems to refer to anything that looks roughly like an AR-15 or Kalashnikov pattern rifle. It is an occasionally popular position in the Democratic Party to advocate for a ban on these rifles.

There are two problems with this. 1: The term “assault weapon” is so poorly defined it doesn’t ban weapons with virtually identical capabilities to AR-15s and Kalashnikovs, so it’s trivially easy to circumvent. 2: It is a proven fact that rifles are used in only a tiny portion of violent crime, as a matter of fact bare hands are a more common murder weapon than rifles, as are clubs or knives.

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls

So this proposal does not make logical sense. So-called “assault weapons” are not uniquely dangerous, they are not used in a large amount of crime, and the entire category is cosmetically defined.

I anticipate the primary argument in favor of an “assault weapons ban” to be to prevent mass shooting. This is a foolish strategy for preventing mass shootings as a person who is deranged can use almost any modern firearm to similarly deadly effect in the context of a mass shooting. Any typical handgun like a Glock for example would produce essentially the same deadly results.",Grandemestizo,359,0.7599999904632568,922,1718024461,2024-06-10 08:01:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dckxpx/cmv_in_the_context_of_american_politics_the_term/,6,2024
1dp2whk,CMV: It is more likely that Trump is a criminal than that he is being persecuted,"Trump has been convicted on 34 counts and has several state and federal charges pending. This is after literal decades of accusations of criminal activity in his real estate and casino dealings. Trump himself claims he is being persecuted by political opponents:

>When you look at what's happening, this is a persecution of a political opponent. This was never supposed to happen in America. This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot. So if you can't beat him, you persecute him or you prosecute him.

Trump has a long history of skirting laws and shady behavior. This leads me to believe the current charges have merit, and are not persecution or anything like it. In particular, the documents case seems to be a clear violation of Federal Law.   
  
He famously evaded the draft based on doctors' assessment that he had bone spurs. [This doctor was a podiatrist who rented space from Trump's father. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-vietnam-draft-exemption.html)It has been pointed out that this ailment doesn't seem to have had any effect on Trump's golfing.

He settled with the Department of Justice a 1973 charge that he was [illegally discriminating ](https://www.thedailybeast.com/doj-trumps-early-businesses-blocked-blacks)in apartment rental practices.

In the aggregate, Trump has a lot of close connections to illegal behavior.

This CMV is solely regarding Trump, and whether he is likely to have performed actions that warrant criminal investigation. I don't want to hear about the other guy. 

Things that might change my mind: Compelling evidence that the charges do not merit investigation. Evidence that other prominent New Yorkers were charged with numerous crimes when they were not actively testing the boundaries of the law. Maybe something else that I have not thought of.

These stories are designed to provoke anger by leaving out key details, presenting one-sided perspectives, and guiding readers towards hating a specific person or group. The lack of balance and nuance makes them highly manipulative.

Many of these posts read more like creative writing exercises than genuine experiences. The themes and plot twists are often repetitive, suggesting that originality is sacrificed for dramatic effect.

Regularly reading these exaggerated and often false narratives can distort one's perception of reality. It fosters cynicism and mistrust, harming the ability to form healthy, trusting relationships. The constant exposure to these toxic stories can make people see everyday interactions through a lens of suspicion and negativity.

The addictive nature of these stories can lead to a cycle of consumption that re-enforces these negative effects. People get hooked on the drama and emotional highs, making it harder to disengage and see the world more objectively.

1d6iy5e,CMV: The only requirement to celebrating pride is being a proud LGBTQ+ person or a straight ally with no other political stances unrelated to lgbtq rights being necessary.,"It's pride month. I am a gay man. I'll see posts and such from friends along the lines of ""You can't celebrate pride if you're not against Israel in their conflict with Gaza. You can't celebrate pride if you don't believe in BLM.""

I personally believe both those things. But I think it's dumb to gatekeep pride with sentiments like that. That you're not allowed to celebrate pride if you're not in lockstep with other political causes. I think that logic is wrong. Here is my reasoning. 

1. You can say it's about ""gay people's protest against oppressor so that means you must be against other forms of people protesting against their oppressors"". But there's plenty of examples of people rising up against their ""oppressors"" that I'm sure most western progressive thinking people wouldn't agree with at all. It's not about standing up against oppressors in general. It's specifically and exclusively about LGBTQ+ people standing up to their oppressors, gaining rights, and creating better lives for themselves, and celebrating how far we've come.
2. I believe it holds up an oppressed minority group up to a higher standard. Simply because a person is gay that means inherently that have more of a responsibility to be support of all other causes of inequality? That's dumb. They should be against other forms of inequality because they're a human being, like anyone else should, that has nothing to do with their sexuality of gender identity. I get you can say it's hypocritical, but that's such a naive way of thinking of it. In a perfect world yes hypocrites wouldn't exist. But anyone of any demographic, oppressed or otherwise, has just as much likelihood to be a bigoted asshole. Telling an lgbtq person they're supposed to have some sort of inherently quality because they are lgbtq is exactly the type of stuff we're fighting against. 

I'm open to having my opinion changed, but frankly it's pretty inconsequential for me because I agree with most of the causes I've seen it being compared to and needing to support. The only one I saw that I was a little iffy on was being against fatphobia. I don't make fun of overweight people, in fact I'm attracted to bearish men, and I think it's great plus size people are getting more media exposure. But I see some probably rage baity things online about what fatphobia is that makes me roll my eyes so idk maybe I am fatphobic? Getting in the weeds there, but the point still stands, I don't think there should be this gatekeeping attitude with pride.

1ddwxdf,"CMV: The political and philosophical arguments put forward by the subreddit r/TwoXChromosomes are extremist, inflammatory hate speech","I want to open by saying I’m a leftist politically and have never been associated with any right-wing or alt-right movements like incel or meninism or anything like that. My view on gender is that men and women are different, but equal and that they should share positions of power equally. I think the model used by many European Green parties (having two leaders, one male, one female) should be adopted by countries in respect to heads of state and other important departments. 

Ok with that out of the way, on to my main point. If you look at that subreddit on any given day their will be posts celebrating concepts such as “decentralising” men from your life which is described as switching all your service providers (doctor, therapist, electrician) to women, prioritising female friends over male ones, abstaining from any sexual or romantic relationships with men, only hiring women if you are in a position to do so etc. 

Can someone please explain how this is not just the white supremacy of gender theory? They’re using all the same talking points and philosophy that straight up fascists use? 

They regularly advocate for what is essentially a gendered apartheid system and will say that males and male characteristics need to be continually devalued and diminished in society. 

I have never heard any of these ideas said in real life, only on that subreddit which leads me to believe it is a fringe ideology on the edge of acceptable thought and should really be looked at more critically. If you speak to people in real life about gender, the overwhelming majority will agree that cooperation and mutual understanding between genders is essential for society and that increased respect between the genders can only be good for society, and this is the view we should be promoting… surely?!

Also the subreddit operates as a massive echo chamber which is don’t think is healthy, I was banned for trying to discuss the intersectionality of class and gender as from the perspective of a working-class man it seems like a lot of their views come from a position of privilege and do not reflect the realities of working-class relationships, social norms and family dynamics. 

Basically, I’m hoping someone can give me a better understanding on where these viewpoints (which seem extreme and dangerous to me) come from and justify why they are valid so I can be better informed.

I've seen some articles say that ""unconditional love is not unconditional tolerance,"" but love and tolerance are one and the same. Everyone has little quirks about them that their partners don't like. They tolerate those behaviors because they love them. But that tolerance has an end point.

1d8308p,CMV: Castle doctrine is a good idea. Stand your ground is not.,"With castle doctrine, the point is that you have a right to defend yourself in your home. It essentially says, well, in the home, we don’t know if you’re lying or telling the truth about an intruder being a threat, so we will give you the benefit of the doubt because it’s your property. Also, this includes the fact that you’re unlikely to be able to retreat safely in your home, so you may be even more justified in using lethal force. 

Stand your ground is essentially castle doctrine but just apply it everywhere. But it is that application of it everywhere that is the exact issue in my book. First off, in public, you don’t have anymore right to be there than the person you believe is attacking you, so you should not be able to be the one who decides if your life is in danger or not. Additionally, it is generally much easier to retreat in public than in your home. 

Another thing is that stand your ground can be easily abused. Someone can just shoot someone and tell the police that the person they shot did x or y. 

Now, if someone does retreat and then has no choice, or is unable to retreat, then yes, deadly force is fine but this is true in all 50 states and doesn’t need a stand your ground law.

It makes sense that you can defend your castle without needing to retreat, but the entire world was never your castle.

I tend to think of competitions where the results are determined by judges as ""performances"" rather than sports, whereas sports are competitions where the results are definitively measured.

I recently read a post(a photo of a fake clickbait twitter thing to be clear, this DID NOT happen) where apparently some man cut off the genitals of his daughter's rapist, cooked it, and fed it to the rapist. Let me make two things clear.

1. I **hate** rapists.
2. I also support human rights.

These things can both be true.

Now, when you look at the comment section, the people who somehow believed the post was real were calling the man a hero, and saying things like ""jury nullification"". This really confuses me. Rapists are bad people, but does being a bad person mean that people should have the right to do just *anything* to you?

My dislike for responses like these are twofold. First, the whole point of human rights is that they are unconditional. The worst serial killer will still get a fair trial-the judge can't say ""it's really obvious now throw them in jail"" You are not a hero or a good person for torturing people necessarily

Second, it's really hypocritical. I hope I explain this correctly but if I don't please tell me. You cannot say ""its okay to torture people I hate"" and then look at other people torturing people they hate and say ""wait that's bad"". This is \[special pleading\], isn't it? Consider public whippings of gay people in the middle east. The people in the comment section will certainly be okay with someone whipping some rapist or predator, but I would argue based on my experience with reddit that most of them would not be okay with the whipping of gay people. I don't think you can say, ""but pedophilia is ACTUALLY bad"" because the people supporting whipping gay people will say ""being gay is bad too""

I support gay people to be clear(Happy Pride Month)and I hope my message there is coming across correctly. Human rights aren't optional for me. There is no ""opt out program"". You cannot torture people, no matter what, or you should be put in a cell as well. That rapist(even though he doesn't exist) should theoretically just face justice, or the closest thing you can get to it.

So why do people celebrate people like this as heroes? Or is this an isolated incident or a joke I don't get?
