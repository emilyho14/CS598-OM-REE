Reddit Submission: [In 2013, France massively increased dividend tax rates. This led firms to reduce dividends (payments to shareholders) and invest profits back into the firm. Contrary to some claims, dividend taxes do not lead to a misallocation of capital, but may instead reduce capital misallocation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/x2efzp/in_2013_france_massively_increased_dividend_tax/)

The article [""Dividend Taxes and the Allocation of Capital""](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20210369) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.113.7.2053) from *American Economic Review* as of July 7, 2023. Inconsistencies in the study's code were identified by other researchers and [submitted as a comment](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20221432) to the journal. They argue that these flaws drove the paper's main findings and that, after correction, ""leaves no clear event study evidence of a positive effect of dividend taxation on investment.""

The corresponding author [disputes this claim](https://www.dropbox.com/s/skenqoxmygjxfcr/retraction_note_for_website.pdf), citing the [retraction notice](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.113.7.2053), which states the paper was retracted by him at the Editor's request ""on the grounds of a coding error in the rendering of a figure and a procedural error in the publication process."" He maintains that both errors ""were made in good faith"" and that neither alteration changed the conclusions of the study.
