1kzv1tu,"CMV: Out of all the groups that immigrate to western countries, Muslim Arabs are hands down the worst at assimilating to western standards","I am saying this as an Exmuslim Arab myself and yes, I know there’s exceptions. I know they’re not all that way. But the painting is on the wall. I’m not saying anyone should abandon their religion, but integration is very important when you are moving to a new country. 

The reason why immigrants coming from let’s say Mexico or Latin America integrate so well is because western cultures aren’t that different and share similar values. The differences between traditional Islamic Arab culture and western culture are so astronomically different that conflict usually arises. Europe's weak stance on who they let in from the Middle East proves this, just look at Birmingham or at Malmo. 

People say ""racism"" and “Islamophobia” very loosely. If people are coming to your home country(pick many of the EU), causing chaos, pushing their own beliefs, killings, getting benefits from a western nation, etc. of course people are going to start getting pissed off. 

Muslim Arabs originally born in the Middle East are used to their thoughts and values being the majority. They get a little confused in melting pot western cultures where they encounter a lot of people with different views. They’re so indoctrinated to think one way that assimilation is nearly impossible. Try going and be a raging Christian in Saudi Arabia, wouldn’t work. You would have to assimilate. 

What you worship or your religion is your business, but to move to a new western nation and expect to force the laws and beliefs of your former nation is just peak disrespect. European countries shouldn’t have ‘no go zones’ because some immigrants refuse to adopt the host country's culture and values.

1kvg6jv,CMV: Ruth Bader Ginsburg ultimately be remembered as a failure to her own ideals by not stepping down after her 2nd cancer diagnosis,"RBG was a crusader for civil rights. As a Supreme Court justice, she helped secure many freedoms for the American people. But her stubborn refusal to step down early in Obama's first term only served to undo her legacy of accomplishments. Recovering from cancer and continuing to work is admirable, but her first diagnosis was in 1999. When her second diagnosis occurred in 2009 and in a different part of her body, the correct decision would have been to allow a democratic president choose her replacement and maintain the balance on the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, she was a victim of her own pride and continued to sit on the bench, ultimately receiving 3 more cancer diagnoses (5 total) before her death in 2020. Her refusal to step away when Obama was in office enabled Trump to skew the court 6-3, and has resulted in multiple decisions that have since undone many of her accomplishments.

Because of her own pride, RBG enabled a far-right regime to cause irreparable damage to that nation.

1ky5bcm,CMV: It is high time we stop normalising islamism.,"We’ve had this discussion before, and I still stand by it, more strongly than ever: it’s high time we stop normalizing Islamism and start calling it what it is — a regressive, authoritarian ideology that stands in direct opposition to liberal democracy, secular values, and individual rights.

Let’s be clear. From systemic homophobia and deeply ingrained misogyny, to apologia for child marriage, terrorism, and ambitions for a global caliphate that would erase pluralism and national sovereignty — these are not fringe elements in Islamist discourse. They are core tenets. They are preached openly in mosques, embedded in school curricula in some countries, and often tolerated or downplayed in diaspora communities. These views are not “extreme” by accident — they stem from the fusion of politics with literalist religion.

And yet, somehow, in a grotesque twist of moral confusion, the Western liberal establishment continues to protect and even promote these ideologies under the banner of tolerance, multiculturalism, and inclusion. Left-liberals, who claim to stand for women’s rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and secular governance, suddenly become apologists when the violators of these principles cloak themselves in the garb of “minority rights.”

This selective outrage, this refusal to apply liberal principles universally, is not compassion — it is cowardice. It is betrayal. It’s a compromise of core democratic values in exchange for votes, virtue-signaling, and a hollow sense of moral superiority.

We must stop conflating criticism of Islamism with racism or bigotry. Islamism is not a race. It’s a political ideology — and like fascism or any other form of totalitarianism, it must be rejected outright, not coddled. Enough with the double standards. Enough with letting clerics who call for stoning or apostasy laws be treated as “community leaders.” Enough with allowing veiled theocracy to parade around as culture.

If someone openly supports Islamism, they are not simply expressing an opinion — they are rejecting democracy, secularism, and basic human rights. And they should be treated accordingly: with moral condemnation, not validation.

This is not a call for oppression. It is a call for clarity. Tolerance ends where intolerance begins. A liberal democracy cannot survive by embracing the very ideologies that seek to destroy it from within.",Middle_Exercise_1549,2710,0.7599999904632568,2266,1748506300,2025-05-29 03:11:40,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ky5bcm/cmv_it_is_high_time_we_stop_normalising_islamism/,5,2025
1kngj7l,CMV: 99% of people would press the button that kills a random person but gives you a large amount of money.,"Here’s a common hypothetical that we’ve all seen before: 

“A button appears in front of you. If you press it, a million dollars will be deposited in your bank account. But a random person on the planet will die instantly.”

There are no drawbacks. No “black mirror” shenanigans. The IRS or whatever won’t get suspicious. What would you do?

I believe that 99% of people, me included, will press that button.

Yes, it’s evil. Yes, it’s selfish. But I have my reasons.

First of all, the vast majority of people would put themselves and their families above strangers. 

I’m not poor, but a million dollars would still get rid of like 95% the of the stress in my life. 

For a financially struggling person, it would literally change their entire life. 

Sorry random stranger, but I value my life over yours.

Second of all, there’s the cognitive dissonance involved.

You simply press a button and get your money. You don’t know who died, you didn’t see them die, you can’t even really confirm if anyone actually died. It’s entirely different than someone handing you a knife and having to actually get your hands dirty.

It’s similar to why non vegans don’t feel guilty when eating meat or other animal products. But most will if they had to kill an animal personally.

I guess the moral of the story is that money talks, and very few people are incorruptible .

They want to force teaching of their Stone Age idiotic religion. They want to influence our politics. I see no issue with wanting this ideology gone.

1ki79g9,"CMV: Universities are not making students liberal. The ""blame"" belongs with conservative culture downplaying the importance of higher education.","If you want to prove that Universities are somehow *making* students liberal, the best way to demonstrate that would be to measure the political alignment of Freshmen, then measure the political alignment of Seniors, and see if those alignments shifted at all over the course of their collegiate career. THAT is the most definitive evidence to suggest that Universities are somehow spreading ""leftist"" or ""left-wing"" ideology of some kind. And to my knowledge, this shift is not observed anywhere.

But yeah, ultimately this take that Universities are shifting students to the left has always kind of mystified me. Granted, I went to undergrad for engineering school, but between being taught how to evaluate a triple integral, how to calculate the stress in a steel beam, how to report the temperature at (x,y,z) with a heat source 10 inches away, I guess I must have missed where my ""liberal indoctrination"" must have occurred. A pretty similar story could be told for all sorts of other professions. And the only fields of study that are decidedly liberal are probably pursued largely by people who made up their minds on what they wanted to study well before they even started at their University.

Simply put, never have I met a new college freshman who was decidedly conservative in his politics, took some courses at his university, and then abandoned his conservatism and became a liberal shill by the time he graduated. I can't think of a single person I met in college who went through something like that. Every conservative I met in college, he was still a conservative when we graduated, and every liberal I met, he was still liberal when we graduated. Anecdotal, sure, but I sure as hell never saw any of this.

But there is indeed an undeniable disdain for education amongst conservatives. At the very least, the push to excel academically is largely absent in conservative spheres. There's a lot more emphasis on real world stuff, on ""practical"" skills. There's little encouragement to be a straight-A student; the thought process otherwise seems to be that if a teacher is giving a poor grade to a student, it's because that teacher is some biased liberal shill or whatever the fuck. I just don't see conservative culture promoting academic excellence, at least not nearly on the level that you might see in liberal culture. Thus, as a result, conservatives just do not perform as well academically and have far less interest in post-secondary education, which means that more liberals enroll at colleges, which then gives people the false impression that colleges are FORGING students into liberals with their left-wing communist indoctrination or whatever the hell it is they are accused of. People are being misled just by looking at the political alignment of students in a vacuum and not considering the real circumstances that led to that distribution of political beliefs. I think it starts with conservative culture.

1kh3uxt,CMV: The far left is very effective at driving average people towards the right.,"Now when I say far left, I should clarify that I'm not talking about economic issues like wealth disparity. Those actually matter and are responsible for 99% of the problems the average person faces. Unfortunately the average person can't make the connection that someone else's life of ease/luxury costs them personally.

What people do seem to care about a lot are the social/cultural issues and that's where I think the left makes the most mistakes. Every argument I see is so hostile and emotional when it comes to these social issues that people who were otherwise middle of the road are pushed right. You can't agree with just 90% of the issue, if you don't agree with that remaining 10%, you're labeled a something-phobe and considered a target for cancellation. Obviously the right makes use of this, because it's really easy to point out how extremist that group is being. What were otherwise average people just end up voting against the group that attacks them.

One really good example of this is Reddit. This website censors a lot of social/cultural debate that's not biased towards the left. It's why a lot of topics are banned on a variety of subreddits.

1knmzjy,CMV: Bachelor's degrees today are what high school diplomas were 40 years ago.,"A high school diploma 40 years ago could get you almost any job that didn't require advanced degree (e.g. MD/DO, JD, VMD, and etc.). But if you look at job postings today for jobs that didn't require any higher education such as receptionist, data entry, retail manager, and etc. have some sort of higher education requirement or strong preference. Someone could live comfortably with a high school diploma job in the middle class up until the 80s.

In the 1980s the high school graduation rate hovered in the lower 70 percent range. Fast forward today, it is now upper 80 percent and in some areas its upper 90 percent. Now does that mean student have become more studious, scholarly, or our education system have drastically improved? Most middle schoolers today probably read and write at a grade school level and can't solve basic quadratic equations let alone any algebraic problems.

One could argue the education system since the 80s has made more strive to be equitable and inclusive to everyone and resulted in artificially pumped up graduation rates so that schools could receive more praise, funding, and attention. We awarded more for less.

Bachelor degrees are now seen as the only viable path to middle class but yet most have a negative ROI if you factor in the cost of attendance and the compounding interest from student loans. No one should have to go college to live a middle-class life. If you want to move up into higher socioeconomic tax bracket then that is what college should be for.

1kyairx,"CMV: The Islamic Golden Age was driven by individual geniuses, not Islamic orthodoxy—and modern glorification of it is dishonest","**Note that this text was translated from Arabic to English by AI and I reviewed it and edited some parts too**  
**---**

I've come to believe that much of the praise Arab Muslims today give to the so-called ""Islamic Golden Age"" is misguided. It treats a handful of brilliant thinkers—like Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Al-Razi (Rhazes), Al-Khwarizmi, and Ibn Rushd (Averröes)—as if they were the natural products of Islamic orthodoxy or Arab culture, when in fact many of these scholars were marginalized, persecuted, or even declared heretics in their time by the very religious and political institutions Muslims now revere.

  
My view is based on several key points:

* **Many of these scholars were persecuted**, not celebrated, in their time. Al-Razi criticized religion and was reportedly blinded by mobs incited by clerics. Ibn Rushd’s books were burned, and he was exiled. Ibn Sina was condemned by Al-Ghazali and accused of heresy.
* **Most were not Arabs**, and many weren't even working within Arab-dominated systems. Persian, Central Asian, and Turkish scholars made some of the biggest contributions, often in relatively tolerant courts like the Buyids or early Fatimids—not under the more orthodox Sunni caliphates. Labeling their work “Arab” or purely “Islamic” science erases the diverse and often non-Arab environments that enabled their ideas.
* **Orthodox Islam turned against philosophy and rationalism.** Thinkers like Al-Ghazali (Algazelus) or Ibn Taymiyya  argued that reason must submit to revelation, which helped shut down the momentum of intellectual inquiry. Theologians who attacked science and philosophy are ironically treated as heroes today, while the thinkers they suppressed are also glorified—this contradiction makes no sense to me.
* **Modern Arab-Muslim societies don’t carry on this legacy.** If Islamic civilization truly had a systemic, religiously-driven scientific culture, why didn’t that legacy continue? Why are major scientific contributions today mostly coming from secular or Western systems? It seems to me that the original scholars were outliers who thrived *in spite of*, not because of, dominant religious culture.

In short, the actual drivers of scientific progress during the Islamic Golden Age were not mainstream Islamic institutions but rather individual genius, cultural cross-pollination (Greek, Indian, Persian), and relatively liberal courts. The glorification of this period by modern Muslims often ignores the uncomfortable truth that mainstream orthodoxy largely opposed or suppressed this intellectual flowering.

  
One more thing I'd like to add that wasn't in my original Arabic text:  
It is also worth noting that many of these scholars, received support not from orthodox Sunni sects, but from non-orthodox Muslim groups like the Shi'i Buyids or even early Fatimids \[whom I myself don't support\], these dynasties most of the time provided MORE intellectually tolerant environments and societies that actually valued rationality and science. Again, while I may not personally align with their theology, it's clear as the sun that they actually created conditions in which rationalist inquiry and scientific advancement are accepted and celebrated, unlike the more rigid circles that later dominated Sunni orthodoxy

  
Why I hold this view:  
I believe the Islamic Golden Age is often misrepresented by most modern Arab Muslims. Many of the scientists and philosophers now celebrated were persecuted by religious authorities of their time. Thinkers were exiled or attacked, not embraced. Most weren’t even Arab, and many were supported by non-orthodox Muslim courts, like the Buyids and Fatimids, that tolerated rationalism, while Orthodox Islam later rejected this intellectual legacy. So I think glorifying it today feels dishonest",Thormosphere_,1578,0.800000011920929,204,1748524548,2025-05-29 08:15:48,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kyairx/cmv_the_islamic_golden_age_was_driven_by/,5,2025
1kgt7ag,"CMV: Western societies need to tolerate Islam less, not more.","This is specifically about Islam. I’m generally at odds with organized religion as a whole but among them, Islam stands out as the most ideologically aggressive, violent, and resistant to criticism. Christian or Jewish extremism exists, yes ,but there are levels to this. The scale, frequency, and institutional nature of violence or repression justified through Islamic teachings far surpass what we see from other faiths today.

And yet in Western societies, Islam is treated with extreme caution. Any open criticism is met with accusations of bigotry, and in some cases, violent threats and action. This creates a chilling effect where people self-censor not because they’re wrong, but because they’re afraid. That’s not tolerance, it’s submission.

I believe we should take concrete steps to reduce Islam’s ideological presence in the West:

**Restrict immigration** from Muslim-majority countries where this ideology is deeply embedded.

**Ban mosques** not because every single one is a threat, but because Islam doesn’t just use mosques for prayer. They often function as ideological centers where teachings can cross the line into political and social indoctrination. The potential for radicalization is built into the model. We don’t need structures that act as ideological distribution points for a system fundamentally at odds with our values.

**Protect speech critical of Islam** just as fiercely as we protect any other form of dissent. The current climate of fear is unacceptable in any society that values open discourse.

This is not about persecuting individuals. It’s about treating Islam the way we would treat any ideology that undermines liberal democratic values. We don’t tolerate Nazism. We don’t tolerate theocracy. So why does Islam, in its political and doctrinal form, get special treatment?

1klmg7r,CMV: President Trump should not accept the 400 million dollar jet from Qatar.,"Donald Trump should not accept the $400 million Boeing 747-8 jet gifted to him by the Qatari royal family. This decision is not merely controversial—it is unethical, unconstitutional, and a blatant affront to the very ideals of American sovereignty and integrity. 

Qatar has long been implicated in funding terrorism, with Trump himself acknowledging in 2017, “The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.” It has provided millions in direct aid to Hamas, hosted its leaders in Doha, and turned a blind eye to known terrorist financiers operating within its borders. Reports have linked Qatari charities to funding al-Qaeda, and wealthy donors from the country have bankrolled Taliban operations. Despite passing counterterrorism laws, Qatar continues to shelter extremists, making Trump’s acceptance of its gift not just unethical, but a serious security risk.

This jet is not a gesture of goodwill—it’s a bribe. Qatar is known for using its wealth to influence leaders who might serve its agenda. The idea that this plane is simply a donation to the United States is absurd. It will eventually be handed over to Trump’s presidential library, meaning it will become a personal asset. No matter how the administration tries to spin it, Qatar is giving Trump something of immense value, knowing it could influence his decisions in the future. 

Beyond ethics, this arrangement directly violates the U.S. Constitution. The Emoluments Clause explicitly forbids government officials from accepting gifts from foreign states. The distinction between gifting the aircraft to the Defense Department first and later passing it to Trump does not change the fundamental issue. Richard Briffault, a government ethics specialist, has noted that once the aircraft is transferred to Trump’s presidential library, it ceases to be a gift to the United States and becomes personal property. No matter how the administration attempts to justify this exchange, it remains a clear-cut example of unconstitutional foreign influence.

This move also contradicts everything Trump has claimed about putting “America First.” He has spent years criticizing foreign governments for exerting influence in U.S. politics. He once attacked Hillary Clinton for accepting money from Qatar (a one million dollar donation to the Clinton Foundation to celebrate Bill Clintons 65th birthday), yet now, he is gladly taking a gift worth $400 million from the same government. His company has also just announced plans for a luxury golf resort in the country. So is this decision based on America’s best interests or his own business ventures?

If Trump proceeds with accepting Qatar’s gift, he does so at the cost of American integrity, transparency, and security. There is no justification for this decision, and no legal loophole can disguise the corruption it represents.",HunterLazy3635,1425,0.8600000143051147,863,1747144245,2025-05-13 08:50:45,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1klmg7r/cmv_president_trump_should_not_accept_the_400/,5,2025

I understand it's a topic many people are passionate about, but so much of the 'discussion' is just screaming, with zero solutions that aren't just genocide. I am, sincerely, not seeing a realistic path forward where Israel is dismantled or radically reformed by outside forces. It's not like South Africa, where whites were a small minority ruling over a large majority of black people, and political and economic pressures were enough to eventually force a free election. It was a fragile, minority rule system to start with. But in Israel, right now, the population is ~75% Jewish. Even if we imagine adding the Palestinians of Gaza to the population, Jews will still be a majority. A free election in a combined Israel & Palestine would still look pretty close to what's already in place. Like what's the plan here? Because 'Two state solution' obviously is not what a lot of pro-Palestinian people have in mind. Not among protestors, and most definitely not on reddit. There is a very strong sentiment that Israel should just cease to be, rarely making any mention of what should happen to the people there.

You can't take the vote away from the Jews, because if you do, Hamas or something like it will win, and their *explicit* goals are to murder the entirety of the Jewish people in the region. Just look at the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund. The Gaza government loudly and openly paid the families of any muslim who murdered any Jew in Israel *for any reason*. Life in Gaza is abject misery right now, and half the population is *still* supporting the October 7th attacks. What exactly do people think will happen if the Palestinians are allowed to decide what happens to the Jews in Israel? That would just be an even bigger bloodbath than the current war.

So... what's the alternative? Expelling all the Jews? And send them where, exactly? Many of them are the children or grandchildren of Jews who were expelled from other Arab countries in the 20th century. You think sending them back to dictatorships that confiscated all their grandpa's property and kicked them out already is a good idea? No? Alright, you think we can find a country willing to take in 7 million Jews? No? Alright, should we forcibly split them up and guard to make sure they are only ever a small minority wherever they go? That hasn't worked out great, historically. Help me see a realistic solution here, people. I'm not condoning the actions of the IDF or the current Israeli government, but you have to be *for* something. You can't just shout ""From the River to the Sea"" and pretend 7 million Jews will just go away. Give me a sane, realistic path forward that doesn't devolve into a second holocaust.

“Obviously but I shouldn’t have to say that. I’m not talking about you.”

Sometimes better, sometimes worse.

We spend a significant amount of discussion on using more inclusive language to avoid needlessly hurting people’s feelings or making them uncomfortable but then many of us don’t bother to when they’re men or white or other non-minority demographics. They’re still individuals and we claim to care about the feelings of individuals and making the tiny effort to adjust our language to make people feel more comfortable… but many of us fail to do that for people belonging to certain demographics and, in doing so, treat people less kindly because of their demographic rather than as individuals, which I think and hope we can agree isn’t right.

There are the implicit claims here that most of us on the progressive left do believe or at least claim to believe that there is value in choosing our words to not needlessly hurt people’s feelings and that it’s wrong to treat someone less kindly for being born into any given demographic.

I want my view changed because it bothers me when I see people do this and seems so hypocritical and I’d like to think more highly of the people I see as my political community who do this. I am very firmly on the leftist progressive side of things and I’d like to be wrong about this or, if I’m not, for my community to do better with it.

What won’t change my view: 

1) anything that involves, explicitly or implicitly, defining individuals by their demographic rather than as unique individuals. 

2) any argument over exactly what word should be used. My point isn’t about the word choice. I used “many” in my post instead and generally think there are various appropriate words depending on the circumstances. I do think that’s a discussion worth having but it’s not the point of my view here.

3) any argument that doesn’t address my claim of hypocrisy. If you have a pragmatic reason not to do it, I’m interested to hear it, but it doesn’t affect whether it’s hypocritical or not.

What will change my view: I honestly can’t think of an argument that would do it and that’s why I’m asking you for help.

1keqtit,CMV: it’s perfectly reasonable to drop friends over political views,"I’ll start by clarifying that I’m a leftist, and that will inform a lot of the examples I use, but I don’t think you need to be a leftist to agree with me here. 
Lots of people, admittedly less these days, talk about how silly it is to stop being friends with someone or dislike someone over their political views. I don’t agree. People who say this act as if politics are some given trait or private matter like religion or culture, when it’s inherently not. Especially in a democratic country, a person’s political views have an impact on the society they are a part of. Yes, people inherit their beliefs from their family or whatever sometimes, but ultimately political views are rarely arbitrary, people tend to have reasoning to support theirs. I want to exclude from this people who clearly haven’t critically engaged with their views or politics. If you grew up in a republican household for example, and you study engineering and kind of just follow headlines, you aren’t really responsible for those views. Also, I mean this more for close friends. If you run in the same circles as someone you disagree with, there’s no reason to make an issue of it if they’re not someone you’re close with, trust, or love, ect.  
I’m not just talking about hateful or extreme views though, like thinking that gay people are sinful or supporting the deportation of green card holders for expressing their beliefs. Even basic beliefs about tax structure, regulations, or welfare. Just because those aren’t as flashy/provocative, doesn’t make them unimportant (they are often more impactful and broad in reach even). Like I said, I’m generally a leftist. If you are a “moderate” or believe in fiscal/macroeconomic policy that maintains the status quo, I think I should be totally justified in having a problem with that. 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and you believe that’s okay? Thats your right, but to me it shows we don’t have the same values (even ethically speaking) and I don’t want to have a close relationship with you. 
Let’s say you’re right libertarian leaning, and you think a too powerful state poses an existential risk, or maybe you think property is a god given right and wealth redistribution violates natural law or something (sorry if this sounds like a straw man for the right, that’s not my point though. If your friend believes in lots of regulation and democratic socialism, I think you have a good reason not to want to be close friends with them. 
Look, I’m not saying you should do this. I have lots of friends I disagree with about this stuff and I’m willing to look past it. I just think politics are a legitimate reason to end or loosen a relationship with someone.

1knazvt,"CMV: People who act like the US is a uniquely cruel, crime ridden and stupid place are participating in the same American essentialism as the people who act like the US is the center of the universe and that freedom and prosperity only exist there.","Since Trump was reelected, I’ve been seeing an increase in anti American sentiments both online and in person. While I understand why (it’s pretty tough to have a good reputation globally when Trump is your president), it’s starting to feel to me like just another flavor of American arrogance. The idea that America is the ultimate hero and that they are the ultimate villain comes from the same place. Blaming every global conflict, every global economic downturn, and every unfavorable cultural movement on the US is just reinforcing the idea that America is the center of the world, and that other countries don’t have their own agency and culture. 

I’ve seen people blame both the Israel/Palestine and Russia/Ukraine wars on the US (they’ve obviously played a part in these wars, but let’s not act like those countries don’t have their own agency and make their own decisions). I’ve seen people blame anti-blackness on the US (as if the US invented racism, and it doesn’t exist in every country on earth). I’ve seen people act like colonialism was an American invention, or that the concept of “stolen land” only applies to the US. I’ve seen people blame the rise of misogyny and antisemitism on the US. To me, this all comes from the same place as the people who say things like “America invented freedom”. 

My main point is that if you’re going to be somebody who gets frustrated when Americans act like they are earth’s saviors, you can’t then turn around and act like America is the driving force of all evil on earth. That is the same thing, just in reverse. The US is just another country, with people who are kind, cruel, smart, stupid, and everything in between, just like everywhere else on earth.

1kv4rk6,CMV: 55+ Communities are just a way to legally discriminate against young people,"For background, I work in real estate and this always annoys me. How can people over the age of 55 be allowed to discriminate against people under the age of 55? How is saying someone under 55 can't live in a community any different than saying someone over 55 can't live in a community? People always point to communities that have certain 'quotas' of young people, but there are communities that outright deny ANYONE under 55, and they deny anyone with kids as well. Familial status is a protected class just the same as age, but age seems to supersede familial status. Why can't communities say ""only college-aged individuals allowed"" or ""Under 40 community""? 

I've talked with lawyers and most just shrug and ask why I care. Does anyone have a good/decent explanation for this?

The thing is, the average democrat voter doesn't really understand stuff either. 

Sure liberal voters are on average more educated than conservatives, but to truly understand policy, healthcare, and geopolitics, you need a college degree on that topic or, really delve in the research with an exceptionally critical mind for years. I'd argue that liberals may know a little more but not that much about vaccines, or tarifs, or immigration.

1kcxb89,CMV: It takes more faith in Paul to believe in modern Christianity than in Jesus,"When I read the Gospels, Jesus appears as a Jewish teacher preaching repentance, Torah observance, and the coming Kingdom of God. His message was specific, grounded in Jewish law, and aimed at a Jewish audience. There’s no Trinity, no salvation by faith alone, and no outright dismissal of the Law. But then Paul enters the picture, someone who never met Jesus in life and who redefines the entire framework.

Paul’s writings pivot from Jesus’ teachings to doctrines like grace over law, justification by faith, and a divine Christ figure who replaces obedience with belief. It’s Paul who opens the door to Gentiles and pushes a theology that would be unrecognizable to most first-century Jews. Today’s Christianity, especially in its Protestant forms, leans more on Paul’s interpretation than on Jesus’ own words.

To me, believing in modern Christianity requires trusting Paul’s authority and vision more than Jesus’ teachings. That doesn’t sit right with me. I’m open to being challenged on this, but I don’t think the historical Jesus ever intended the religion that bears his name to become what it is now.

I think the objective of this is to get his opponents focused on it, force them to expend time and effort fighting the possibility of a third Trump term, when all along Trump and his toadies are working on a separate plan, which is this: when people start rioting in the streets because they can't get basic essentials, or possibly because of other issues, Trump will send in the National Guard. He can use heavy handed enforcement tactics to force violent encounters; shootings, assaults, riots, etc. At that point he declares martial law, claiming he's just trying to keep the peace.  Then he can suspend due process and start rounding up protesters and throwing them in camps (a 1,400 acre detention center is currently being planned for Texas). He can also arrest any politicians who oppose him.  As the situation becomes more tense Trump will claim he has no option but to suspend elections until things cool down, making him president indefinitely.

1kfaxhw,CMV: Arab countries are pretty terrible at protecting their religious and ethnic minorities.,"Whether they are a religious or ethnic minority group, minorities are persecuted and treated as worse than second class citizens. 

The biggest example of the Jews, they were always treated badly in Arab countries, even before Israel existed like Farhud massacre in Iraq (1941) and Hebron massacre (1834), in fact half of Israel population is Mizrahi Jews (MENA Jews) who fled their countries because of Arabs persecuting. There barely any jews left in Arab world while other Muslims nations like Turkey (15k Jews) and Iran (10k Jews) still have thousands of Jews living there. 


Same thing with Christians, Israel is the only MENA country with growning Christian population, attacks against Christians are big problem in Arabic world, there always a news about Christian being killed there and church being bombed. Even under secular Arab regimes like Saddam and Assad, Assyrian names were banned and speaking in Aramaic was discouraged. Coptic language (the native langauge of Egypt) has no native speakers and only used in praying. Amazigh langauges (indigenous langauges of North Africa) are all endangered and some of them got extinct, Libya even banned speaking them under Gaddafi. 


Kurds despite being Muslims are also heavily discriminated in Syria and Iraq, they have been massacre against Kurds (also Assyrians) by Arabs from over century like the Anfal genocide in iraq where 200k Kurdish civlians have been killed. Kurdish langauge and culture (like Newroz holiday) have been oppressed in Iraq and Syria since 60s and there are over 300k Kurds in Syria whom are still stateless to this day.


Since the fall of Assad, Alawites have victim of genocides where many alawite dozens were fullly ethnic cleansed leaving no alawites left and over 31k alawites took refuge in Lebanon and the number is still gorwimg every day. Druze also are persecuted there have been dozens of attacks against them since Assad fall of and they have even called for autonomous region in Syria and support from Israel because they don't trust Sunni Arabs to protect them, same thing in Israel, Israeli duze are very pro-Israel because Palestinians used to persecute them before Israel existed.

So, if he doesn't show restraint against them, why would he for others? However, it will be worse because 1) suspending Habeas Corpus will cause more protests and 2) now they won't be able to challenge their arrest.

When children die in Gaza or Ukraine, there's a global outpouring of sympathy, hashtags, media coverage, and activism. But when Indian civilians or soldiers are killed in terrorist attacks like Pulwama, Uri, or 26/11 the same energy is almost never seen.

It feels like empathy is being filtered through political trends. If you're aligned with what's seen as the ""popular"" or ""correct"" cause, your grief is validated. But if you're from a country like India and your attackers are tied to state-sponsored terrorism from Pakistan, suddenly it's seen as ""complicated,"" and global sympathy becomes muted or absent.

I'm not saying we shouldn’t care about innocents in other countries we absolutely should. But I question why grief and outrage seem so inconsistent.

1kfok4r,CMV: The US should not be supporting Israel.,"**I am going to make this case purely off of how Israel has acted towards the West, and NOT their war crimes in the Gaza strip or occupation zones or anything like that.**

This is for 2 reasons:

1. because many Western readers may not be as concerned with the Palestine issue (understandable, as it doesn't directly affect their daily lives as much as the climate crisis or social issues),
2. and because Israel often claims that the ICC and the rest of the world courts are biased against Israel, so we'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they're correct and aren't committing even a single crime against Palestinians.

so I will try to make the case that Israel's violations **towards Western powers alone** should be the reason we cut funding to that country.

* Not only that, they go even further and demand the US allows [Russia to be able to keep their military bases in Syria](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-lobbies-us-keep-russian-bases-weak-syria-sources-say-2025-02-28/) following the deposition of Omar al-Bashir.

This is a very common idea in the Muslim world today.

My claim is that this is not part of Muslim tradition, and is an import from 20th century Nazi propaganda.

Why I’m convinced:
	•	Pre-modern Muslim writers bash Jews plenty, but never for “having no culture.” The insult shows up only after European antisemitic tracts (like Protocols) hit Arabic presses in the 1920s.
	•	Hitler’s Arabic radio + leaflets (Mufti of Jerusalem on the mic) hammered the “cultural parasite” line all through the war.
	•	Sayyid Qutb, Baʿth textbooks, and 1970s state media basically copy-pasted that language—and that’s what today’s memes echo.

Things like:

* The language expectations change constantly, and if someone messes up or says something outdated, it feels like they get jumped on instead of just being corrected.
* There’s this “all or nothing” vibe, where if you disagree with one part, suddenly you’re not an ally anymore.
* And the public shaming stuff — even when people are clearly trying to grow or figure things out — just doesn’t feel productive. It starts to feel more about calling people out than actually changing minds.

1kzvm77,CMV: I think incels & redpill bros make dating easier for nice guys,"I know it sounds silly, but I think maybe I owe my life to incels & ""red pill"" toxic men

Recently me & my wife celebrated our wedding anniversary. She told me that she couldn't believe she lucked into marrying me, and it's a statement that is on the one hand absolutely absurd - she's beautiful, caring, has a good job, is a wonderful mother & wife, while I am far less attractive, make less money and could probably reasonably be described as ""a weird nerd"". Still, this woman feels like she's the lucky one to be with me. And the funny thing is I completely believe her.

When we exchanged dating stories in the past hers just seem so terrible, while mine are like ""we went on a few dates, didn't work out"". I think this is why I feel my own path to her was just meeting a few women who just weren't for me but were good experiences overall, while she was living a nightmare of the worst guys in the world until she lucked into me - not the worst guy in the world. Jackpot!

And this has been my experience with a lot of the women I went out with - women who seemed genuinely happy to be going out with me  after having a lot of bad experiences.

And this is why I think all those redpill bros & incels might have actually helped me out a lot. They keep trying to ""science"" the subject of dating, a very subjective individual experience, but in doing so may have created a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy. One metaphor I keep seeing in that context is the one of supply & demand. So... A lot of the paradigms they operate under actually act as self sabotage (like making a woman feel beautiful, safe & comfortable are considered bad things in those circles? Like that whole ""girls don't like nice guys l"" thing?). If we bring it back to that market metaphor - I might have really benefited from the disparity between supply and demand by being not a huge asshole in a market absolutely flooded with huge assholes. 

And it seems to hold true - being a reasonably nice dude seems to make me really appealing to women even now. I get looks. I get flirted with. I get complimented a lot for being a good husband & good dad. I feel like hot shit, and objectively I'm probably not. I married way up. It's absolutely silly that the woman I lucked into marrying thinks she married into me, and I think the way a lot of men (not all men, obviously) behave might have significantly contributed to that. I think all those guys might have accidentally stumbled into being right. Women don't want to date them. But it's likely because they are bitter & hate them, which causes them to become even more bitter & hateful, onboarding new guys into being bitter & hateful, and that makes dating much easier for those who have absolutely any amount of chill.

I have never felt more like women really go for nice guys (actually nice guys, not assholes pretending to be nice), and the more people insist it's not true, the easier time actual nice guys are likely to have with women as long as they manage to avoid growing bitter & resentful ",Orgalop,533,0.7599999904632568,326,1748693491,2025-05-31 07:11:31,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kzvm77/cmv_i_think_incels_redpill_bros_make_dating/,5,2025

1ks9e3g,CMV: Abortions should be legal because they do no appreciable harm when done properly,"I've thought about this topic from both sides and I honestly can't think of a legitimate argument for why abortion should be illegal. I'll present the arguments I've heard against abortions here and refute them in the ways I would argue.

""Every human being should have the right to life."" A human fetus really hasn't started living a human life yet. It's never laughed or cried or even seen the light of day. And if the mother wants to abort it, then it hasn't formed any meaningful social connections either. If I were to ask you what day you would consider to be the first day of your life, you'd say the day you were born, not the day you were conceived. If you're not even living a human life yet then you're not really a human being yet.

""Wait, but you just called it a human fetus back there! You're admitting it's a human being and therefore  it has the right to life!"" No, a human fetus isn't a human in the same way that human hair or a human hand isn't a human. Just because something is made of human cells doesn't make it a human being.

""A fetus is a baby, and you wouldn't kill a baby."" Calling a fetus a baby just goes against common sense.  No one in their right mind would place smashing a petri dish with a human IVF embryo in it and killing a baby on the same moral tier. It just goes against intuition. If you google image search ""baby,"" you would never find a picture of a fetus no matter how long you scrolled for.

""My religion says life begins at conception."" And I believe that it doesn't. We're both allowed to have our own beliefs, but beliefs don't form rational arguments. Logic and reason do.

""Abortion scars women for life."" Not getting an abortion when you don't want to give birth is even more scarring. No one gets an abortion because they like doing it, it's just the lesser of two evils.

""Some women die during abortions."" The WHO says ""Deaths from safe abortion are negligible, <1/100 000 *(5).* On the other hand, in regions where unsafe abortions are common, the death rates are high, at > 200/100 000 abortions."" I imagine unsafe abortions occur in places where abortion is illegal, but that's just my supposition. Either way, death by abortion doesn't seem like a huge issue.

I could list other counter-arguments I can refute, but I'll stop there. At the end of the day, women (and everyone for that matter) should be able to control the inner workings of their bodies as much as they can. That much seems like a common-sense human right to me. And lastly, what kind of a life could you expect to have if your own mother didn't want to have you? Abortions ensure that only babies that would be cared for and that are wanted would come into being. So being pro-choice isn't just being pro-choice, it's also being pro-love.

I made the argument that by denying due process with the intent to limit that to only illegal immigrants means that there's no protection against it's application against citizens since if law enforcement can deport people without seeing a judge, citizens could be sent to foreign prisons without being able to prove they're citizens and didn't commit a crime.

It’s frustrating to watch corruption, extremism, or illegal behavior go unpunished—especially when it seems like the system protects the powerful.

1klr1ed,"CMV: if there is a single thing Trump is right about, it’s the fact that NATO member states need to uphold their 2% spending financial commitments.","Before I get into my arguments, no I do not sympathize with Trump or his supporters in any way, shape, or form.

That being said, Mr Trump is not right. He is ultranationalist-level far right. Not a single one of my policy views align with his except the fact that NATO member states are acting in bad faith and need to face consequences if they do not comply with their commitments. 

While not binding, NATO member states have made formal commitments to spend at least 2% of their annual GDP on national defence. Given escalating tensions globally now (e.g., Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, Russia and Ukraine), it has become more important than ever for NATO allies to stand together in case things cascade into full-scale war. Unfortunately, many NATO member states seem to be free-riding on the NATO defence benefits—especially since a majority of spending is done by the U.S.—by contributing significantly less than 2% of their GDP to defence. Many do not even have a roadmap to reach that benchmark. Agreeing to do something, then failing to follow through while continuing to benefit from the security umbrella provided by others, is an act of bad faith and creates what in politics is known as the free-rider problem. The U.S. spends a disproportionate share of its annual budget on defence, while some ally states contribute little more than token amounts.

1kd3inn,CMV: The Allies were right to drop the nuclear bombs on Japan at the end of WWII,"The Allies decided to drop two nuclear bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in order to try and force Japan to surrender and therefore end WWI. My view is that this was morally the right decision, admittedly an incredibly difficult decision, but the right one. I do not believe nuclear bombs are the answer in basically any situation. I am not debating whether they should exist or be used in the future, just in this particular instance.

If we look purely at estimated death figures, on the high end there are 246,000 deaths from the 2 nuclear bombs (yes I understand many more lives will have been implicated), compared to estimations in the millions on BOTH sides (Allies and Japanese) for a land invasion of Japan. I understand the dangers of a utilitarian perspective, but if we look purely at the numbers they are not even comparable. A quarter of a million compared to multiple millions, when by this point of the conflict an estimated 70-85 million people had already died. I cannot begrudge the Allies for wanting to reduce the overall death toll, and the best way to do that was to end the war as quickly as possible, and in this case that meant using nuclear weapons.

I think in arguments against this, many people also misunderstand the Japanese point of view. Not only were they almost entirely set against surrendering, there was very little structure within the upper echelons of Japanese government/military. We can see this from the Tokyo War Crime Trials, where they all basically refuse to answer questions, claim they didn't have authority over anything, and someone else was in charge. Whilst this does show general chaos of wartime command, it also explains the lack of accountability taken by many of the Japanese following WWII. We can also see how badly some of the Japanese did not want to surrender even after the two bombs were dropped, as there was an attempted coup by some army officers to prevent Hirothi's broadcast accepting defeat. In this speech, the lack of accountability can be seen, as Hirothi claimed there was no intention to ""infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to embark on territorial aggrandisement"" which is just a blatant lie. As recently as 2015, conservative voices in Japan have lobbied Japanese Prime Ministers to reflect that Japans actions were not aggressive or illegitimate. I understand this reflects a minuscule portion of the country, and am by no means saying that Japan is not sorry for the crimes they committed, but it is concerning that this view is still circling around government circles.

There are also the environmental impacts to consider. Mainly the consequences caused by radiation. However, the radiation created from nuclear bomb testing is greater than that created from these two bombs. I understand that those tests were not done on densely populated areas, so the effects of these two will remain greater. I will admit that this is the weakest point of my argument, as there are clear environmental impacts. I just believe the overall lower death toll is of greater significance than the environmental impacts that occurred.

I am willing to change my view on this. Have I underestimated the environmental impact? Do you think even with the lower death toll dropping the nuclear bombs was still morally wrong? If so, why? Again, I am not debating the existence of nuclear bombs, just when they were used to end WWII.

I posted this as I wanted to have my view challenged, and your contributions have been very helpful. I have tried to respond to and engage with as many of you as possible. I have awarded multiple deltas to people that have brought new things to my attention, or have convinced me that things were more important than I had given them credit for. In no particular order I will list below factors behind my change in view. 

1. 3 days between the two bombs was not long enough 

2. I underestimated the impact of the Soviets, and the effect they had on a potential Japanese surrender, in light of this, the bombs were less necessary 

3. US being unreasonable by demanding unconditional surrender. Whilst I may understand the potential logic behind this, I had not given adequate thought as to how this would've affected Japan's willingness to surrender 

4. Other motivations behind dropping the bombs, aka a dick swinging contest with the Soviets 

5. Bombs or land invasion were not the only two options. There were other options, every options had their drawback but this was not a binary choice as I had originally presented it

6. The bombs could've been dropped on unpopulated areas/military targets 

These are all valid points, and thank you for bringing them to my attention. I will now no longer be responding to comments.

In these cases, my offers have been solid.  I've offered 20% down, have good credit, and in some cases have gone over asking with my offer. It doesn't matter.  The offer with waived home inspection always wins, and I'm not willing to give this up.

But this got me thinking... It seems like, if a buyer can waive a home inspection and people are willing to do that as a concession, then nobody gets to have a home inspection. All buyers are eventually going to be forced to waive it to compete if they want any home at all.  

This opens all buyers up to the risks of buying a house without an inspection: potential structural issues, electrical issues, water intrusion issues, etc, that will be so expensive to fix that they may result in bankruptcy, with no way of knowing ahead of time what you're walking into.  That's an insane way to live.

Any current owner/seller, even the ones who don't think there's any major issue with the house they're selling, would be morons to not push that risk onto the buyer if they can get away with it.  It basically absolves them of their duty as homeowners to maintain their own property and makes it somebody else's problem.  In fact, if they know they're going to get an offer from somebody who waives inspection, it practically invites them to defer maintenance!  Why fix it right if you can sell the house and make it somebody else's problem?

Legality aside, I'm honestly not sure why mortgage companies allow it in their terms, since it puts the loan at risk if the buyer immediately becomes upside down and declares bankruptcy due to the need for major remediation.

And none of this is a case of ""if somebody's stupid enough to do that it's on them"" because it's such a juicy plum for the seller that it forces the whole market down into the mud to compete. Once we're there, there may as well not be any home inspections at all.  

If you want any buyers to be able to do preliminary home inspections, they needs to be a legal requirement.

1kqbzag,CMV: Not having things in common is a bad argument against age gap dating,"I always see it as a big talking point  “I don’t know what a 40 year old could have in common with a 24 year old” but that’s just ignorant. Has no one here ever been close with older relatives, co workers, peers etc? I’m in my early 20’s and a guy in nursing school and I’ve met women from younger then me to in there 50’s I have plenty of stuff in common with. 

An example is my best friend from my cohort I’m 22 and she is 38, for example we both have interest in nursing, we both drive sports cars even race each other home sometimes, same ethnic background, both into basketball and other things. Now I’m not romantically interested in her but to act like people can’t have anything in common with an age gap is ridiculous. 

Especially considering having things in common isn’t even a necessity for a good relationship. People date people from around the world who don’t even speak the same language and one of the most popular sayings regarding dating is literally opposites attract. It’s a lot more important to marry someone with the same values as you than someone you have some stuff in common with anyways cause they aren’t a friend they are a romantic partner.

1kp0iln,CMV: The American flag represents all Americans,"I am an independent never-trumper. I try to incorporate the American flag and red white and blue into my life as much as possible, and encourage my peers to do the same. I get that I might be mistaken for maga, and that is my point. The flag represents all of us, and they dont get to claim it as their symbol. 

Today, I saw a TikTok about a veteran that has flown a flag since 9/11, but he took it down on November 6 last year. There were hundreds of comments supporting this and saying they did the same. 

I didn't serve so I don't have that perspective. I want to respect all military personnel, past or present, and show my American pride. Is going flagless the better option until 2029?",yagot2bekidding,340,0.75,455,1747508486,2025-05-17 14:01:26,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kp0iln/cmv_the_american_flag_represents_all_americans/,5,2025
