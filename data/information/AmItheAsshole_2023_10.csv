177c2tj,AITA for refusing to let my wife name our kid something stupid?,"Me (25m) and my wife (23f) are having our first child together. She is currently 9 months pregnant and could give birth anytime in the next couple of weeks. The only major fight we have had throughout her pregnancy happened a couple days ago, and it was about what we were going to name our kid.  
  
 It all started when we found out the gender of the baby. We didn’t do a gender reveal and decided to find out the gender at one of her checkups because we didn’t want to spend time making two lists of names then have to get rid of one after. So after we found out we were having a boy we sat down together and made a list. Almost all of the names she suggested were normal, until the one that caused me to write this post. She suggested we name our son Mune. She told me the name was from this movie she watched when she was younger and that it always stuck with her. I told her the name was a little out there and he would get made fun of for it. She claimed he wouldn’t and we started going back and forth trying to decide whether to add the name to the list or not. Eventually she agreed to keep the name off the list, we picked some that we liked, and I thought that was that.  
  
 Later on in her pregnancy her mom decided to throw a baby shower as it was her first grandchild, and my wifes pregnancy was almost over and we hadnt celebrated once. It was fine for the most part until we started to open the gifts. Most of them were normal baby things like diapers and bottles, until we got to her moms gift. My wife opened the gift bag and pulled out a blue handmade blanket. It seemed normal enough at first until my wife unfolded it and low and behold there was the name Mune written on the blanket. When I saw it i was pissed but didn’t want to cause a scene so i stayed quiet. After that reveal I had family members come up to me and ask me about the name and why i hadnt told them. I didnt know what to tell them as i didnt have a clue about this either and just had to embarrassingly tell my family that, which pissed me off even more.  
  
 Once the event ended and me and my wife went home I started to question her about the name. She got defensive and told me that it was a good name and that i was overreacting about it. I brought up the earlier points and told her it was a stupid name for a kid and if she wanted to name something Mune so bad she could use the name for a dog. She got upset and called her mom to come get her. After she left she called me and told me she wouldn’t be coming back for awhile. Everyone ive talked to about this has said im not the asshole, but now that my wife has been gone and ive been thinking about it I feel like I could have handled the situation better. Aita?

17gii96,"AITA For accidentally letting my sisters friends I have a ""crunchy vegan baby""?","To preface: I do NOT have a crunchy vegan baby and I think this is mostly a misunderstanding. 

My daughter is six months old and breastfed. I am vegan, my husband isn't, and our toddler is vegetarian/vegan-ish (he doesn't like animal dairy but will ravish eggs). We don't cook meat in the home, although my husband eats it out of the home, and our toddler isn't a fan. Before anyone jumps on my ass he has been introduced to it because his dad eats it. He just prefers fries. (Same, kid).

Anyway, I took my daughter to my parents house about a week ago. My mom is also vegan so we were eating our tofu and rice. My daughter has just started solids so she was also going ham on my plate. My parents dog ate more than I did.

My younger sister (15) had her friends over. They were having burgers or something and watching me with my daughter. After I ate I nursed her and one asked if I was vegan. I said yes, she got this weird kinda look, and asked if my baby was going to be vegan.

I just kinda shrugged because, you know, she could be a dairy hating fry fiend like her brother or a cheese-aholic like her daddy. Maybe, maybe not. My sisters friend nodded and spoke to me a little more before leaving. 

I thought it was a little odd but shrugged it off. Teens are weird creatures sometimes.

Anyway, unbeknownst to me, this teen had decided I was a crazy vegan ""crunchy"" mom. Theres a few tiktokers who are apparently stupid about their kids safety and happen to be breastfeeding vegans. Like yours truly.

I thought all was well - my sister sent me a link on the importance of a balanced diet for kids among a few other bits and eventually I called her. I was like, what the hell? And she started going on about how I was a bad mom.

I told her to watch her mouth and she blew up and said I was the one with a ""crunchy vegan baby"". 

So, turns out, her friends are all convinced my children are terribly abused by my veganism, and because she'd never seen my toddler eat meat it was clearly true. 

I told her to calm the fuck down, explained my parenting, yada yada.

She them got mad because all her friends think I'm a terrible mom and I should have been clearer and not just shrugged her friends question off because I should have known what they would have assumed I meant.

I think she's being dramatic. They were worried, wires got crossed, all is well. She's still acting like its the worst thing in the world.

So, basically, aita for making a mistake and having my sisters friends think I've got a crunchy vegan baby?

As a side note, my husband was feeling petty so he went and got ribs for lunch. Filmed little lady eating her first rib. I can now firmly say she will not be a vegan, vegetarian or anything of the sort.

171q8sd,AITA for telling my wife nobody cares about her small business?,"My wife (27F) owns an Etsy shop where she sells handmade jewelry. She has some real talent and the jewelry she sells is genuinely very nice and high quality. She gets a surprising amount of sales on there too, and has great reviews.

The issue is that EVERYWHERE we go, EVERY conversation she has, she slips in something about her shop and tries to promote it. Talking to a friend? She'll casually mention a big sale she made or a custom order she got and not-very-subtly mention that she'd give her friend a coupon or something similar. Talking to our waiter? She'll mention that she has a pair of earrings on her shop that would compliment their eyes. Talking to someone online? She'll somehow manage to say ""as the owner of a small business.."" She literally cannot have a conversation anywhere with anyone without trying to sell them her jewelry.

The other day was a family member's birthday, and they were having a decently-sized get-together with just other family members and a few close friends. I went with my wife, and she's a pretty social person even outside of promoting her shop so she was quickly making conversation with my family. Of course not 5 minutes later she was showing someone the bracelet she had on that she made and mentioning that she sells them and talking about how since they were family she would happily give them a 25% discount. She probably had that exact same conversation with at least 5 people during the 2 hours we were there.

As soon as we left I spoke to her and said she needs to quit doing that. I told her if people were actually interested, they would ask her about her store, but not every single person she talks to wants or needs to hear about her art. She got upset and said that she just wants to spread her product and doesn't see what she's doing wrong and hasn't spoken to me much since. I feel like I'm the asshole since I will admit I had a pretty harsh tone and could've been a lot nicer during that conversation, plus I get she's just trying to sell her products, even if it gets obnoxious. AITA?

17eyun2,AITA for laughing at how my friend used her inheritance?,"I decided to post this with the help of my husband (who is unsure if my behavior was over the line). Here's what he thought was important for the sake of the story:

\- My friend of about 17 years (Delilah, 37f) had a very problematic childhood. She barely went to school because her only parent was addicted to substances among many other problems. I don't know how she slipped through the system for so long but she was pretty much a lost cause by high school because of how little discipline she had. 

\- At 23 her dad died and due to the matter of death, Delilah won a somewhat large sum of money.

\- Once she got that money, Delilah chose to go to a community college. I guess she learned to love learning and had so many interest she never knew about that she went to several schools in most of her 20s and came out with several degrees.

So my view: I've held my tongue on her wasting so much money on school. I guess if it was my money I'd want to save it or explore then get a degree, not go head first. She has 6 degrees and to me it's just silly. The real kicker is my husband is an engineer and makes more than she does, despite all her side jobs and projects. 

Well we were visiting her and she mentioned how she wanted to study history and maybe take a class or two online for the fun of it. I laughed and asked if any of her inheritance was still even left. She said that shouldn't be my concern. I admitted it was ridiculous, she could have just bought a nice house with that money, instead of blowing it on degrees that she doesn't even use.

She told me all her degrees served a purpose, she loves what she does now and loves learning because she was deprived of it as a child. She told me she wasn't going to defend herself to someone who did not grow in a similar situation.

My husband told her to calm down. After is now awkward and I'm not sure if I need to apology or not.

170w5oo,AITA for telling a bridesmaid she can't bring her dog to the bachelorette party?,"I (30F) am the maid of honor for my sister (32F)'s wedding. We're planning a bachelorette weekend in Vegas since my sister has never been before and has always wanted to go. We plan to be out of the hotel as much as possible, making the most of our trip. 

One of the bridesmaids (28F) recently asked in the groupchat about accommodations for her dog, a fifty-pound Australian shepherd. 

I was confused...she wanted to bring her *dog?* 

The bridesmaid said the dog was an ESA (emotional support animal) and that she likes to have her dog there on planes (we live on the east coast and will be flying to Vegas). 

We literally flew to Istanbul together not six months ago without this dog and there was no issue whatsoever. And when we get to Vegas, does she plan on just...keeping her dog all cooped up in her crate the entire time?! The hotel we're booking does have dog-friendly rooms, but doesn't allow pets to roam freely around the hotel room unsupervised - the dog would have to stay in that crate for god-knows-how-long each day. That can't be great for the dog. On top of that, our other younger sister coming on the trip is very allergic to dogs. We don't have the money to just let this one bridesmaid book her own room for just herself and the dog to prevent my younger sister having an allergic reaction. Unless this bridesmaid was willing to pay for a room herself, I told her she couldn't bring her dog on this trip.

I thought that was going to be the end of it, since this was definitely reasonable on my part (in my opinion), but this bridesmaid is now being super pissy with me and saying how it's sooo wrong and horrible of me not to let her bring her ESA. Bearing in mind she's been absolutely fine without the dog in the past on much longer flights. Bearing in mind I even told her she could bring the dog IF she was able to pay for a room of her own so that my sister doesn't have a reaction.

178s9hl,AITA for not wanting my autistic sister to come to my birthday party?,"I (15F) am turning sixteen soon and I’m having a pretty big party to celebrate. I have a stepsister (16F) who is autistic. She is fairly high functioning but very spoiled and throws tantrums whenever she doesn’t get what she wants. When I was little, she would always ruin my birthday parties so I stopped having parties with my mom’s family. I usually have parties with just my dads family and my friends. This year, I’m turning 16 so I’m having a bigger party which my dad is mostly paying for but I’m inviting my mom, stepdad, stepbrother and half siblings (13M and 11F). I’m having a party with about 90 people and over the weekend my grandma is gonna take me and some of my friends and cousins to their cabin in the mountains.

I do not want my stepsister to come to the party or to the cabin. I know she’s going to ruin it. She gets jealous whenever I get anything and my dad is planning to gift me my dream car at the party so I know she’s gonna throw a tantrum. She always steals the attention from me and I just don’t want her there. I’m not inviting her to the cabin either because it’s just for my cousins on my dad’s side and my friends. I’m not that close to my stepsister. Besides, we’re going to hike, boat, ride horses, and do other outdoor events that I know my sister can’t handle. She’s gonna start crying if we try to go on the water and she can’t walk further than half a mile without getting tired.

Yesterday my stepsister told me that she’s really excited for my party because it’s at the zoo and she loves it there and she has never stayed in a cabin before. I told her that she’s not invited and she started crying and ran to her room. My mom called me an uncaring brat for not inviting her and telling her so bluntly. She said that her and my stepdad aren’t coming either if she’s not invited. I don’t think I’m the asshole because it’s my party and I don’t want her to ruin it.


UPDATE: I don’t think my moms family is coming. My stepbrother is coming because he’s 18 and doesn’t care if my stepsis is invited and I wish my little siblings could’ve come, but I’m not inviting her. I might do a smaller celebration with just them, but I don’t have the money to pay for that myself so I can only do that if my mom pays for it (which she probably won’t).",Due-Sale4970,5123,0.9200000166893005,1170,1697412822,2023-10-15 18:33:42,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178s9hl/aita_for_not_wanting_my_autistic_sister_to_come/,10,2023
1781c9v,AITA for publicly telling my step-sister that the quote from her book can't be stolen from her because it isn't hers?,"My (F30) step-sister (F42?) wrote an autobiographical book related to a war in a region that's currently experiencing significant disturbances again. In her book, she used a quote that has been widely circulated for years. I googled it and couldn't find the original author, but people have been quoting it on Twitter, blogs, forums, and YouTube since at least 2012.  
My sister made a post on IG and FB, shaming another account for sharing this quote without crediting her as the author. She also included a portion of her book that contained the quote. In the FB comments, I sent her links to several places where this quote had been used over the years and pointed out that it's a popular saying, so she shouldn't take it personally. For content published in 2022, she said it was after her book's release date; for 2021, it was after the date she submitted the manuscript; and when I showed her posts from 2018, she asked what my problem was.  
I then messaged her privately, explaining that I didn't have an issue with anything. It's just a well-known quote, and many people often come up with the same ideas simultaneously. However, I mentioned that it's bad PR for her to claim rights to a quote that, on the first page of Google, doesn't link back to her book al all but to various other people and their content from years before her book's publication.  
She responded, saying I was insulting her intelligence. She said I'm entitled to my opinion, as is she, but accused me of publicly dragging and harassing her. She ended the conversation, then deleted and reposted her original post, removing my comments.

17bx2pa,"AITA? My wife says I'm asking her to ""mask"".","Hi reddit. Sorry for this sockpuppet account. I am 34m and my wife ""Polly"" is 32f.

Like a lot of couples, we debrief after our workdays. Polly works in a high-touch, high-interaction job, so we usually say our hellos, make dinner, and then eat separately so she can wind down a bit. Then, afterwards, we sit in the living room and shoot the shit.

Polly has a mild neurodivergence that means she tells... let's call it ""branching"" stories. She will get bogged down in sidestories and background stories and details that, frankly, add nothing to the core story about her workday. That's usually fine, but I've noticed it getting a bit worse, to the point that, by the time she's done, it's basically time to watch a show and go to bed. I mean, I'm spending upwards of an hour just listening and adding ""mmhmm"" and ""oh wow"", because she says she gets even MORE distracted when I ask questions.

I brought this up with Polly, and she said that I am asking her to mask her disorder, and that's just how her brain works. I get that feeling, I really do, but I am starting to feel like I'm a side character here, because she takes up all the airtime that we set aside to debrief.

Here's why I might be an AH: I said ""well, we all change our communication styles based on context, right?"" And she said that's different, and that masking is not code switching. 

I just want some time to talk about my day, too, but I don't want her to feel bad. AITA? ",aita-mask,4681,0.9399999976158142,1190,1697758599,2023-10-19 18:36:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bx2pa/aita_my_wife_says_im_asking_her_to_mask/,10,2023

170wv5z,"WIBTA for ""telling on"" my neighbour for ""locking me out"" of a group meeting by refusing to engage the automatic door (I'm in a wheelchair).","  
I live in a co-op that has both disabled and non-disabled residents. I came up with the idea for a peer-support/help exchange roster, where people could help each other out if interested.   
Another resident and I set up a meeting to share the idea, get feedback, and potentially some money out of our ""social fund"" that people pitch into at the beginning of every year to finance group activities. The day of the meeting my wheelchair battery almost completely stopped working, and even though my co-presenter and I had agreed to arrive 15 min early, the meeting was almost about to start by the time we arrived, due to my wheelchair moving so slowly. I was right behind her, attempting to enter the room when she let the door close in my face. I gestured for her to hit the auto-door opener because there was only one on her side of the door. She neither let me in nor told anyone that I was outside waiting for the door to be opened. Instead she told them I couldn't make it because of wheelchair problems so people we pretty surprised when I finally found someone to push the door open for me.   
Later on my co-presenter admitted to doing this purposefully, she said ""why would I tell them, you already made us late I wasn't going to allow you to disrupt the meeting any more."" (We weren’t late, just not early, and once able to enter, it took all of 45 secs to join the group.) She also admitted to wanting to replace me with someone else because my wheelchair problem had frustrated and annoyed her. Note: this project is titled Advancing Accessibility and Good Neighbourliness, and the ideas all mine. I asked her not to use the language & materials I'd produced and she said ""I'll use whatever language I please"" and said I was ""deluded"" for thinking people wouldn't understand why she couldn't ""let"" me attend that meeting. (Anyone not using a wheelchair could just stroll in, I was the only she could've one kept out like that.)  
It feels so unfair and underhanded, so I really want to inform the rest of our neighbours who went to the meeting about what she did. Part of me thinks that's petty because it happened months ago (she only just admitted what had happened) and I still did get to attend the majority of the meeting.

17de736,AITA for refusing to sleep on the couch?,"I (32M) and my wife (31F) got into a heated argument after her friend accused me of hitting on her. The other day, on my way from work to home, I came across a friend of my wife and she looked like she was carrying heavy stuff so I asked if she wanted a ride home. At first she declined but as I was leaving, she changed her mind and got into the car. We had a nice chat whilst driving and all was well. I even told my wife about it when I got home.

Yesterday, I was confronted by my wife because I allegedly ""hit"" on her friend. I obviously denied it and told her the version of events but apparently I was persistent with said friend when offering her the ride. I only asked twice, and the second time was asking if she was sure. My wife insisted that her friend isn't the type to just lie about something like this. Naturally, I asked why she trusted her friend more than me and then she told me about how her sister's husband cheated with a friend. I was angry at how I was being compared to someone else based on a mere accusation and we ended up arguing. Then we were just about to sleep and she told to sleep on the couch because she didn't feel comfortable with me. I argued that I wasn't going to be punished for something I didn't do and after quite a back and forth, I eventually let her have the room and slept in the other one instead.

I woke up in the morning to yet another confrontation about why I didn't sleep on the couch. I was obviously baffled and asked why I would sleep on the couch when there's an entire other room. According to her, if one spouse tells the other that they should sleep on the couch, then they should do as asked to show that they're sorry.

She is always looking over my shoulder, she will straight up yank my laptop away from me and look at what I'm typing, if my phone goes off she goes ""oooh who is that?!"" and things of that nature. I've gently tried to explain to her that I don't want her touching my stuff like that, she'll say stuff like ""oh, well I'm an open book, it's no big deal!"" When I've explained less gently to her, she borderline cries and gets into an anxiety loop where she accuses me of being mean and/or mad at her.

I'm currently in a long-distance relationship and my boyfriend and I rely a lot on sexting to keep our relationship fun. He's in a different time zone, so the things I send him at night won't get responses until the next morning some times. Today I noticed he was sending me (text) responses to photos I had taken last night about what they made him want to do with me. I want to point out quickly that there were no kids in the room at this time, and even if one had wandered in, they're too short to get my phone and too young to read. I decided to leave my phone on a tall standing desk by my own laptop while going to get a cup of coffee, knowing my coteacher would probably look at it.

When I got back, my coteacher told me in a very serious voice that I need to be careful about what I am doing at work because she saw my disgusting and inappropriate texts. I told her she wouldn't have seen them if she hadn't been looking for them, and she said that wasn't the point, that she felt sexually harassed but wouldn't go to HR about it ""because the children wouldn't be able to handle a change in teachers.""

She came into the relationship with 2 daughters, Hannah who is now 14 and Daisy who is now 6 and I’ve had the joy of knowing them as the kids of one of my best friends and as my own stepkids. Their father left when Lexi was pregnant with Daisy and nobody has seen or heard from him in 7 years, so he completely abandoned Lexi and the girls. My own marriage broke down a year later in 2017 due to my wife cheating. It was a shitty time all round and Lexi and I relied on each other a lot but our friendship didn’t progress romantically until 2020.

I love both Lexi and the girls very much but I have never tried to force myself as a father to them, since I knew Hannah remembered her bio dad real well and has struggled immensely with his abandonment. It happened naturally when Daisy called me Dad one day and hasn’t called me anything else since. Hannah has also  started referring to me as her dad but still calls me by my first name. 

Anyway, at the wedding reception once all the speeches and stuff were out of the way, my mom grabbed me and told me that Lexi and the girls had a surprise for me. Basically, I was pulled away and Hannah and Daisy asked me to officially adopt them. I never expected this and was so over the moon I cried tears of joy so of course I said yes. 

Word quickly got out and ever since my sister  Claire has been insanely jealous. She has stepkids of her own and they have a mom very involved in their lives snd they do not view Claire as a mom at all. She has tried to push it and it’s caused bitterness between them. My sister has made some incredibly bitchy comments saying it’s not fair that she’s been involved with her stepkids a lot longer and she is only viewed as their dad’s wife whereas after just ‘3 short years’ I’m already a dad.

I’m honestly sick of her trying to ruin my happiness so I told her her jealousy was both pointless and pathetic and it’s really not my problem at all that her relationship with her stepkids is different than mine and I made her cry.

She is now saying I’m an insensitive AH as she doesn’t have bio kids and it’s the closest she’ll get even though I don’t have bio kids myself.
My mom says she is being childish but some others think I need to show compassion.",regulardadsunite,3703,0.9700000286102295,168,1697410283,2023-10-15 17:51:23,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178red6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_jealousy_over/,10,2023
17k7mvl,AITA for telling my husband to talk to his mother re: our newborn,"My husband and I just had our first child together after a couple years of trying and dealing with infertility. Our son came early, a month and a half - we spent three weeks in the NICU and it was a very emotional time for me/us.

Fast forward and we are now home and getting used to everyday life with a baby. We have been getting visitors pretty often compared to what we’re used to, and his parents come every couple of days. 

Lately, I have had extreme anxiety when they come over because his mother has been incredibly overbearing to a point where I feel insulted. Each time they visit, she is constantly staring and analyzing how I am taking care of my child and making comments on what I “should” be doing or what she would do. Mind you, my husband was born in the 80s and she has not taken care of a baby since. This came to a head the other night when she flipped out on me for sitting my child up to burp him. She for some reason believes you can’t do that to a newborn, even though it’s exactly how they showed us on the NICU. It would have been one thing if she actually had advice, but what she was saying made no sense and how she said it to me was incredibly rude and condescending. She also went on to comment on how he was dressed (not enough layers), how he was being fed (because he was drooling), and kept calling him by his middle name (see below).

I’m not a confrontational person, so when they left I asked my husband to talk to her re: her behavior. My husband also did not stick up for me as any of this was happening. This quickly spiraled into an argument, which yes is partly my fault because I was so heated about my MIL, and he told me that I’m overreacting, constantly miserable around them and I should “get over it”. Now he is saying that he wants to move out and raise our child separately.

I do want to add my husband and his parents are from a different country. They have lived in the US most of his life, but there are barriers at time culturally. Regardless, I’d like to know if I’m TA and overreacting - is this “just how I’m laws are”?

Last add: while my husbands reaction is extreme, other things I “complained” to him about my in laws leading up to this: his mother telling me I gave birth “the easy way” (emergency c-section), his father for some reason feeling comfortable grilling me about breastfeeding (I’m not for multiple reasons), his mother texting me two days after giving birth asking me not to name our child the name we DID end up choosing bc she does not like it (now she refuses to call him by anything but his middle name), his parents questioning what I was doing that caused our son to come early..",DreamerInTheThreads,3639,0.9599999785423279,368,1698710363,2023-10-30 18:59:23,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k7mvl/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_talk_to_his_mother/,10,2023
174589z,AITA for telling my MIL she can no longer have contact with my son?,"I’m a single mom (F42) of four- Arden (F13), Briony (F11), Robin (M10), and Kaya (F7). All of us, except Robin, are Deaf, with ASL as our first language. Arden and Briony’s dad (M46) left when the girls were 4 and 2, and I met Kaya’s dad, Alex (M43) shortly after. He had just come into custody of his nephew, Robin.   
Robin’s bio mom (Layla, F47) gave Robin up to focus on recovering from her long-term drug addiction. Robin is fully aware of who his bio mom is, but considers Alex to be his dad, and has called me his mom since the age of 2/3ish. Layla has told me in the past how grateful she is for me filling that role, and that she feels more like Robin’s aunt than his mom. All this to say, when Alex was diagnosed with cancer two years ago, it was pretty clear to all of us that I would continue to raise Robin as my son after Alex’s death.  
Alex passed away in June, and ever since, his mom has been causing problems. While she’s never been outwardly hostile towards me/my children, she often complains about our use of ASL (Most of the family learnt at least some basics to support communication, but MIL insisted she was too old and couldn’t do it) and has made comments in the past about my inability as a mother due to my deafness. My older girls are practically non-existent to her, and she often ‘forgets’ that Kaya is her grandchild too and focus solely on Robin.  
MIL spent most of the funeral telling people that I was ‘unfit’ and trying to ‘steal Robin away from his real family’. It was hurtful, to say the least, and made me uncomfortable welcoming MIL into my home after that, but I convinced myself that it was for the benefit of the kids- they’ve just lost their dad. I didn’t want to take away a grandparent too.   
Last Saturday, Robin came back from an outing with MIL looking miserable. He wouldn’t talk to anyone about what had happened and spent the rest of the weekend shut away in his room. I tried to ask MIL what was going on, but she didn’t answer any of my messages. Finally, Robin broke down in tears, asking me if ‘Grandma was really going to take him away’. It turns out that MIL has been repeatedly telling Robin that she’s going to take him away from us, even telling him she’ll call CPS on me to have the kids removed. On Saturday, MIL had gone even further, saying she could just drive away with him, and he’d ‘never have to see us again’.   
I immediately sent MIL a message informing her that she was no longer welcome in my home or near any of the kids, and let Layla know what was going on and that she was still welcome to visit/have Robin to stay, if MIL was nowhere nearby. My phone has been blowing up ever since, with people asking me to reconsider. I haven’t said anything about what happened, so can only assume MIL is spreading false information, but all the negative responses are making me doubt if I’m actually in the right here.

179jpz6,AITA for “disinheriting” my daughter?,"I didn’t actually disinherit my daughter it’s just what my wife claims. 

My first wife had drug problems and still got primary custody of our son. I was young and didn’t fight her on custody and when he got older we weren’t close so I felt awkward asking him to live with us. She tried to prevent us from communicated and moved around a lot so it was always hard to spend any time with him until he got his own phone. But now I have spent more time with him and now we are close. 

My second wife is hard working and very financially successful as an engineer. In fact she makes more than me. Our daughter takes after her, she is a straight A student and is going to be back in school to be a nursing practitioner soon. 

My wife is angry with me because my daughter and I aren’t close. She goes to her mom for everything and doesn’t speak to me much. We were close when she was young but since high school it’s like she pretends I don’t exist. I try to reach out but it’s met with silence. I think my wife poisoned her against me because I have spent most of my money on my son. My wife told my daughter I didn’t pay for an cent of college for her and my wife did all the saving for her college fund. 

I didn’t really contribute to my daughter’s college fund.I didn’t pay for any piano lessons etc. I did pay for half of the family expenses with my wife like the mortgage but my extra money has been going to my son. Partly child support but I’ve also been contributing outside of that. He didn’t finish school with good enough grades for college. I gave him money to upgrade his grades and helped him get a place to start college. He got 2 semesters in and then left because he was depressed. He has a lot of issues from growing up with his mother and I feel partly responsible because I didn’t try to fight for custody. I give him money for rent and he has issues holding down a job so he needs support. 

My daughter recently reached out with an schedule for her and her fiancé’s wedding. It had his and mom’s dance but not the father daughter one. I was confused and asked my daughter about that and she replied “we aren’t close enough for that”. I was shocked and asked her why she would consider us not close and she said “well you basically disinherited me”. I called her and asked her to explain and she said because her mom paid for college and will be helping her with her NP degree and I didn’t give a crap about her after middle school because of my son. I explained everything I said above to her and she said I should have split my funds and time between them. I told her I felt like I did and she got angry and said I didn’t and it’s like she was raised by a single mom and that’s why she is uncomfortable with having a wedding dance with me because it would be a lie.",Vegetable_Bet404,3562,0.8799999952316284,1036,1697497934,2023-10-16 18:12:14,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179jpz6/aita_for_disinheriting_my_daughter/,10,2023
17bx0zh,AITA for telling my wife that she's not welcome at my parents' house anymore because she's too loud?,"My wife, Karen, and I have been married for 5 years. She's a great person, but she can be really loud. She laughs loudly, talks loudly, and even snores loudly. It's not a major problem at home, but it can be really embarrassing when we're in public or at social events.  
Recently, my parents had a big party for their 50th wedding anniversary. Karen and I were both invited, but I was really worried about how she would behave. I told her beforehand to please try to be quiet, but she didn't seem to listen.  
As soon as we arrived at the party, Karen started laughing and talking loudly. She was also making a lot of noise with her jewelry and bracelets. I tried to subtly hint to her that she needed to quiet down, but she just ignored me.  
At one point, Karen was talking so loudly that she interrupted my mother during a toast. My mother was really upset, and she later told me that she felt embarrassed.  
After the party, I had a serious talk with Karen. I told her that her behavior was unacceptable, and that she's not welcome at my parents' house anymore until she learns to be more quiet.  
Karen is really upset with me. She says that I'm being oversensitive, and that she's not going to change her personality just to please me.

17hywgh,WIBTA for yelling at my spouse for leaving me alone in the car to hike?,"I got a minor medical procedure last week following a medical treatment involving lots of meds with hefty side effects. The side effects and healing process from the procedure are at their worst yesterday and today. I'm not supposed to do anything strenuous including hiking, kicking, jumping, or running for two weeks. 

My in-laws came into town for a week and we haven't seen them in 9 months. My spouse booked a reservation for a tour at a national park a few months ago, not knowing I would be undergoing this medical treatment.

On the 3 hour car ride to the town with the national park, my spouse decided he wanted to stop by an additional national park to hike. This is a national park we hiked at previously last year. I was not feeling well. They went to hike while I waited in the car. I was annoyed but it wasn't a big deal.

Today, after a hotel stay, we went on the tour. It involved hiking 3 miles downhill mostly. I was mostly fine but in pain towards the end. To my surprise, my spouse decides to go on another hike at the national park from yesterday. It's a 4 mile hike. I'm in too much pain from the 3 mile hike I wasn't supposed to do in the first place today. I say I don't think it's fair to ditch me in the car alone like this. They all leave anyway.

I'm currently alone in the car by myself and shocked I have signal. I'm pissed and I don't think I plan on talking to them the rest of the day. I'm tempted to just take the car and drive off.. I feel like it's extremely selfish to ditch me here at a park only a couple hours away from home which we've all been to before, not just yesterday, but previously when I was able to hike.

17cp1kz,AITA for throwing my friend’s girlfriend out of my house?,"I (35F) have been friends with Alex and Adam (twins 35M) since our mom’s were pregnant with us. Literally grew up together including them being only 3 days older than I am. Alex got engaged several months ago and the wedding is the weekend before Halloween. I love his fiance, Kelly (30F) she’s a beautiful human. Adam started dating a girl a few weeks ago, Jordan (28F). Jordan is the definition of spoiled brat. Only child who has never been told no and quite obnoxious about daddy’s money.

Alex and Kelly have their wedding planned already and are just waiting for the day to arrive. Ever since Jordan came into the picture she’s been trying to insert herself into the wedding. I’m currently 6 months pregnant with my third and final kid. My other two littles will be ring bearers and my husband and I are both in the wedding party. Jordan has apparently pulled Kelly aside more than a few times asking to replace me as a bridesmaid so I don’t “ruin the aesthetic” of the wedding. Kelly declines every time because we’re basically family at this point.

Kelly has told me each time she’s done this and spoken to both Alex and Adam. Alex as her fiance has taken her side, but Adam is staying neutral at best, avoidant at worst. My husband and I had both couples over last night for a chill dinner. Jordan immediately upon seeing said I look like a beached whale. So 6 months pregnant, not exactly small but I’m size 6 when not pregnant. I was livid. I told her at some point my belly would go away but she was stuck with her ugly personality and kicked her out of my house.

Kelly, Alex and my husband all think I was within my right to throw her out, even if what I said wasn’t exactly nice. Jordan did some more name calling and yelling before dragging Adam by the arm out of the house. I told him he could stay if he wanted and she called me a “boyfriend stealing bitch.” Doesn’t make sense but ok. Today Adam texted me saying I took a low blow and needed to apologize for being as asshole to Jordan. I don’t feel like apologizing, but am curious, was I out of line.

Update: (thanks mods) Adam came over earlier today and we spoke at length about Jordan’s behavior. I told him I hated the way she made me feel in my own home, and worse that she did it in front of my kids. I told him I can’t control who he dates, but if he wants to keep seeing her I would not be attending hangs when she is present. Adam said he and Jordan argued from the time they left my house and most of the day yesterday. He broke up with her and threw her out! He hasn’t responded to any of her messages. He showed me some of them and they are FOUL. He apologized to me for his role in all of this and not sticking up for me in the moment. Alex also apparently ripped Adam a new asshole yesterday and told him Jordan wasn’t allowed at the wedding. Adam told Alex about the break up and let Alex know if she shows up Adam will direct security to escort her out. Adam also apologized to Alex and Kelly. Adam told me he is embarrassed on behalf of Jordan and her behavior and told me hopes this doesn’t change anything between us. I told him we are family and that doesn’t change. I did ask him to choose better girlfriends moving forward.",Fun-Government-148,3347,0.9700000286102295,314,1697845621,2023-10-20 18:47:01,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cp1kz/aita_for_throwing_my_friends_girlfriend_out_of_my/,10,2023
17jfokn,AITA for signing away a house to my baby mama even after finding out she put me on child support?,"The mortgage is in her name but she put my name on the deed when our son was born. We were pretty much in agreement that it was her house. 4 years later, I keep our son on the weekends.

3 months ago, BM lost her job. She had me sign a piece of paper that said, handwritten, “I no long live at this address” because she can’t get public assistance unless she has proof we don’t live together.

My gf, who works in child support, says that she’s trying to put me in child support. BM had always said she’d never do that, but then my gf showed me the statues and. I ran this by BM and she said she withdrew the application when she found out.

Weeks later, BM says she can’t get mortgage assistance unless my name is off the deed. My gf says that something seems off. I signed the docs anyway, but BM told me the sig wasn’t valid so we agree to meet again to re-sign.

The morning of, my gf says “i just got an email that a letter addressed to you from DSS is on its way”. I text BM. She says she got a call about it and was gonna tell you about it this evening and says it’s probably just a notice, and that if she wanted me on it, she wouldve done it by now. My gf says she’s BSing and explicitly tells me NOT to sign the deed over. Says that I need to file for 50/50 custody. Gf tells me to call DSS asap.

Gf texts me an hour later with a voice memo with a rep from public housing assistance saying I do NOT have to be off the deed for BM to get mortgage assistance. I call DSS back and find that BM deliberately went and submitted the child support application. Gf tells me to stop all contact with BM and that this is now a legal issue.

But none of this was consistent with what I knew about BM. I called BM and she admitted to everything, but said she didn’t know about not having to have me off the deed. She said she is only using public assistance until next week, and then she is revoking the child support case. None of that explained why she had to have me off the deed nor why she deliberately put in a child support application. I stated that because i don’t NEED to be off the deed, I will wait to sign it over. She hit me with “so now you’re trying to withhold my own house from me?” And knowing her, if I pissed her off by not signing it, she would keep me on child support permanently.

My gf argued that I shouldn’t give up the only asset that may help pay off the child support one day. I asked my family and coworkers and they disagreed. Saying trusting her is my best option and that it’d be best to sign over the deed to keep the peace.

My gf said my BM controls me and that I am spineless and that I had no reason to give away the only asset I had. She even went all the way to say that she felt betrayed and that I chose to appease my BM over protecting our household finances. We have been fighting all weekend, but I genuinely felt like I did the morally right thing, as well as the only thing that’ll make BM drop the child support case.",throwRAbowlofchow,3231,0.8500000238418579,2264,1698622012,2023-10-29 18:26:52,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jfokn/aita_for_signing_away_a_house_to_my_baby_mama/,10,2023
16xgnuw,AITA for blowing up on boyfriend about him not doing shared housework and that his ADHD isn’t an excuse? I called it a misogynistic dynamic.,"My boyfriend (m35) and I (f33) have been together for a bit over year and living together for 5 months. Overall, we’ve both shared that we enjoy living together. When it comes to daily housework, we do a good job of sharing tasks like washing the dishes, making the bed, laundry, etc. 
There are certain tasks I find myself doing more, like cleaning kitchen surfaces and sweeping, and tasks he does more like mowing and grocery shopping. 

My issue lies with the less frequent, but equally important tasks. Things like changing the bed sheets, mopping, scrubbing the toilet, wiping down windows and mirrors, wiping off furniture surfaces, cleaning the shower, dusting baseboards, etc. He has done them just a handful of times since we’ve moved in. He sees me doing them, so he knows they are things that need to be done, and theyre overwhelming completed by me. I’ve brought up to him multiple tjmes that id like him to contribute more. He usually became defensive or gave excuses. He says because of his ADHD he doesnt notice when it gets dirty or forgets. In the end, he says he will do better and then takes up some of those tasks for the day, but theres no long term improvement. 

Today i found myself again working my ass off on these chores. i approached him again about my frustration and he got very defensive and downright angry. we both escalated quickly and it turned into mutual yelling. He again cited his ADHD as the cause. i said he does amazing at managing his adhd in his career and in other tasks by using strategies like setting reminders, alarms, putting things into a calendar, etc. He should implement them for housework too if he cant remember. he told me to write him a list of what needs to be done and when. i said no because im not taking on the mental load of being the household manager and sent him a video about how it is unfair when women have to manage and delegate tasks and schedules for their spouse to do their share of the work. Eventually i just sent him a chore list and schedule i found online because im not sitting down for an hour to make one. 

the fight dragged on and at one point he brought up that i do things that annoy him too.. like when i left a candle burning and a throw pillow got a burn mark (we were both in the room when this happened and the pillow was accidentally nudged from the bed to the nightstand). i thought that comment was unrelated to the real issue. it ended in me saying i wasnt going to end up in a misogynistic household where the woman is expected to do most of the cleaning and manage when others clean.

16z704f,AITA for telling my aunt I will ban her from seeing my parent in skilled nursing if she doesn’t stop being so judgmental?,"I (45f) am the daughter of a wonderful parent, who, unfortunately, is facing the final chapter. My parent needs full time care, as they suffer from Alzheimer’s.  My aunt recently came to visit her sibling, and had an attitude the entire time she was here. When I finally pressed for an answer to “what’s wrong are you okay?” She went off on me about how my parent shouldn’t have to live in this place. She told me I am selfish for not having my parent at home with me, and was very critical of the care my parent is getting.

The facility is very highly rated.  I vetted several recommended through a social worker before I chose this one. Is it perfect? No.  Nothing is. But they are safe, which is the main worry with an Alzheimer’s patient. 

Also, my parent is combative. My aunt doesn’t see it, but it is true. My aunt lives across the country and only makes it out here a few times a year. 

I have a full time job and two teenagers at home. I cannot care for my parent full time. I just can’t.  I feel bad enough about this without her piling on the guilt trip. 

I am the sole power of attorney.  I told my aunt I can have her banned if she doesn’t keep her opinions to herself, and of course that only made her even madder. She does not get how hard this is.

17fq8zg,AITA for wanting my fiancé’s step dad walk me down the aisle?,"My fiancé and I have been together for 6 years and we are getting married in May. My fiancé’s step father married his mom when he was 3 and raised him like his own. His mom died from breast cancer when he was a teenager but his step dad let him stay at home until he was 26 and even trained him to be a mechanic like himself. I have a lot of respect for his stepdad raising a child that’s not his own and helping us both when we needed it. He co-signed for our first place because neither of us had regular jobs and income and when we bought a place he and my fiancé did all the renos. 

My own father is a deadbeat to me. He dated my mom when they were both young and then left when I was born. He didn’t give us money and my mom never asked which is crazy if you ask me. I found out after I as an adult that he never wanted me but she did and felt guilty because he wanted her to get rid of me. So it’s not like he wanted me to exist. He visited me a few times in my childhood but never let us see his other family so I have half singling I only met when I was older. My mom and I were pretty poor growing up, we had government aid and when I got older I realized my half siblings were raised in a middle class home and my mom and I suffered for very little reason.

My husband is a blue collar worker in construction. He works long days, his job is pretty physical, and he works really hard. He gets up at 5am and gets home by 630. My days are usually around the same, give or take an extra hour in the morning.

Every single day my husband gets home, he wants to go to the bathroom and take a shower the second he gets in the driveway. This would be one thing if he was quick--but he takes at least 25 minutes on the toilet and 25 minute showers, and I cannot start dinner with the kids hanging off my legs. They just scream and cry every single time. I've started to ask him to wait until they go to bed, given I really only have a 2 hour window to get dinner ready, eat, clean up the dishes, clean up their chairs, get them ready for bed, get them baths etc.

He complied at first, but he's now telling me it's very unfair to ask him to sit in dirty clothes and be a sweaty mess for two hours until they get to bed. Which I understand it's uncomfortable, but you know...I've just been alone with the kids for 13 hours straight. Every day. I have stuff I still need to get done, too. My kids are in their tantrum phase as well, which has been really hard. 

He got really snippy with me today and said I was being incredibly selfish when I asked him to wait. I said I felt he was being selfish by running to the bathroom for almost an hour every time he gets home when he *knows* I have stuff to get done, too.

So, AITA here? Or is he?",Aware_Objective9275,2885,0.7699999809265137,6347,1698789515,2023-10-31 16:58:35,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kwlaj/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_shower_when_he/,10,2023
175qy8m,UPDATE: AITA for “ruining” my daughters graduation?,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bpmf2e/aita_for_ruining_my_daughters_graduation/)

Hi. It's been a while and I'm not sure if anyone would even care at this point but I accidentally logged into my throwaway on an old laptop and remembered this.

Quite frankly, I'm really embarasssed and ashamed to reread my original post. My attitude was terrible and it's one of those moments I wish I could go back in time and shake some sense into my past self. As many people in the comments predicted, I know longer have a relationship of any kind with my daughter, or two of my other kids. COVID and lockdowns did a number on our family, I'll just say that.

I've been doing a LOT of reflecting and therapy over the last year and I realise I've not been the kind of mother my children have needed in their lives. I have no contact with my daughter now - who has married and moved abroad now - and, from her wishes, this will not be changing anytime soon. I also have very little contact with two of my other children. My relationship with my final child is strained and I am doing everything I can not to break it.

After having logged into this account again and seeing that post, I find myself desperately wishing to go back in time and maybe I could've stopped the breaking of my family if I'd behaved differently here.

I don't really know what I want to say here. Maybe just hopefully encourage one person who has been deemed 'the asshole' to reflect sooner rather than later and maybe their lives won't go the same way as mine.

ETA: I'm going to log out of this account again now. Maybe I'll pop in again in another four years with better news. Thank you for the comments and advice I've received. And to those who think I'm beyond redemption, I truly hope you're wrong.

17jee5t,AITA for expecting a full refund for my daughter’s birthday cake.,"Today was my daughters 2nd birthday party, I went with a new girl that was recommended to be for the dessert. When I spoke to her over a month ago I sent her two different examples of what I wanted both decently easy. Price was not an issue, we would have paid whatever was quoted. 

We settled on an option for a 35 person 1 tier cake (marble cake with pink and white frosting with some glitter and white chocolate ghosts on it) and 40 ghost cake pops wrapped for part of the party favors. The quote including deliver was $180. We have been in contact almost every day this week confirming all the details. 

She was supposed to deliver it today at 9:30am to the party venue. Delivery cost was included. I paid in full in advance, and added a tip. $200 total. At about 9:45am she texted me that she was running about 40mins to an hour late, and would not be bringing the cake pops at all due to “an issue” and would refund us for them. At this post we are already at the party and guests are walking in, my husband ran to giant next door and grabbed plain cupcakes as a last minute resort. 

She finally arrived at almost 11am with a cake that looked nothing like discussed and was not even decorated as it should have been. She put the cake down and ran out of the venue. I texted her multiple times for a refund with no answer, she has since blocked me on all social media, and sent me $100 refund (half the total amount) the cake was awful and after cutting into it and trying it we ended up telling the venue to just trash it and went with the cupcakes instead. 

I’m furious and don’t know what to do. My family says it’s not a big deal and to be happy with the partial refund.",Significant-Chard999,2615,0.9700000286102295,215,1698618306,2023-10-29 17:25:06,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jee5t/aita_for_expecting_a_full_refund_for_my_daughters/,10,2023
176jndn,WIBTA If I didn't pay for my stepkids private schooling?,"I (36f) have one (13F) child. My husband (46) has 4 kids (13F,11M,8F,6F) with his ex wife. Their divorce was very amicable and he gladly pays for his ex’s home and cash support as she was a SAHM. This amounts to close to 8k a month. He makes 250k (15k month net) while I make 400k (around 23k a month, varies). I would guess his ex makes 60k a year now.

We live in a high cost of living city so Ex's house is only 3 beds and ours is 4 beds (almost 10k a month). Before marrying me he lived in a studio down the street and he would take the kids during his days but put them to bed at her house. I lived in a two bedroom paying 4k, so my daughter had her own room. Now, his kids share a room at our house when they are here 30% of the time. We have an uneven amount of kids and can’t afford a 6 bedroom. I have put my daughter in her own bedroom. She’s only 2 months younger than my oldest stepdaughter and is with us almost all the time. Her father is out of state and I receive meager child support.

Between that and my daughter attending private school (started 2 years ago before we married), I pay a little less than half my salary every month to tuition and mortgage payments.

Ex wife is now asking my husband to either allow my oldest stepdaughter or stepson to have their own bedroom, and to send all the kids to private school. Quite frankly, we can’t afford it. I am making great money now but was basically paycheck to paycheck most of my daughter’s life. I pretty much decimated my retirement and got into big debt (100k) to start my business that just started thriving last year.

She is claiming I am treating my child like the favorite. I have always instilled academic values in my child- she has never received anything less than an A and has a lot of dreams. The other kids are great kids but they do not value education as much. I’m not judging, just evaluating, but the kids are different. They have been raised differently, and that's fine.

I told my husband we can consider private school for each kid individually as they get older and  they possibly get more academic rigor but sending 5 kids to private school is just out of the question. I feel like I am being expected to foot this bill because I am successful but I also have my long term financial security to work out. He has a healthy retirement (to which ex is entitled to half) and I have nothing to fall back on if my industry gets a downturn. My career is half his career’s age, I do not have wealth like he has.

I asked my daughter if she was ok sharing a room with her stepsister, and she said she would prefer not to since the kids are messy.

AITA for not wanting to pay for all my stepkids private schooling and changing up rooms?

Edit: My four stepkids share two rooms at my house which mirrors their living situation at their moms (13F & 11M) and (8F & 6F). This weekend we are going to figure out a room divider.

1700z9v,AITA for telling my SIL I paid for her honeymoon?,"Throw away account because family drama.

Before we were married my (34F) and husband (42M) were in a horrific car accident, both almost killed. Since we were unmarried we each received separate 8 figure settlements. Literal fuck you money as we were hit by a major carrier 18 wheeler in 2016. We both still work full time, I have a 6 figure salary my husband 7 figure salary. Sounds braggy, sorry, but it’s important. Now to the point.

My brother, Mike (38M), proposed to my now SIL, Alice (32F) in 2017 and married in 2018. I love them both and would burn the world down for them no questions asked BUT I think they see my husband and I as an ATM. Post settlements, husband and I paid off all our student loans. I have a master’s he a Ph.D. so not cheap. I also, without his knowledge as a surprise, paid Mike’s student loans with the help of SIL. Would have paid SILs too but she had a full scholarship so no loans.

Mike and Alice paid for their own wedding as Alice’s family couldn’t afford it but chipped in where they could. It was a beautiful wedding. They stayed within budget but Mike realized he wouldn’t be able to take their dream honeymoon and asked if my husband and I could loan him some money for the cruise he wanted to take her on. We agreed and asked him to pay us back within a year of the trip. He agreed. To this day we haven’t seen a dime but aren’t mad over it. Alice and Mike hit a rough patch with some health issues, then covid and now here we are.

My SIL can be a lot. She also likes to tell me how to parent my kids (5M, 3M, and 1M). She and Mike don’t have any and don’t plan to. Fine their choice. My oldest had his birthday party over the weekend and in true 5 year old fashion asked for a trucks theme. We decked the house out. Day was going well until Alice made a comment about my 3YO having a meltdown over not getting any presents. I told her he’s little and expressing emotions how he knows. Not a super big deal for me as he’s pretty easily redirected. 

She commented how I’m enabling him to become a “Karen” later in life and how she wouldn’t tolerate it if she had kids. I quipped it was a good thing they weren’t planning on having any and went back to my little guy. She said something to the effect of “poor parenting” and in a snap judgement I told her I paid for her honeymoon and she and Mike owed me $7k and once I got that money back I would take her input into consideration. She grabbed Mike and stormed out of the party. That night my brother, SIL and her sister blew up my phone calling me an AH for telling her. My brother is pissed because it was “supposed to be between us.” Something I don’t recall us talking about. I thought she knew the whole time.

17ky8my,AITA for telling my daughter she needs to get over me grounding her as a teenager?,"When my daughter (now 26F) was 17, I left her home alone for a week while I was on a business trip; while I was away, she threw a party behind my back which ended with her and her drunk, underage friends trashing a significant part of the house inside and out. All told, they did a few thousand dollars in damage (including two broken TVs and damage to the car); the place looked like a warzone, or the aftermath of a bad teen movie. So, I told her she would have to pay me back, and that she was grounded until she did; no electronics outside of schoolwork, strict curfew, no friends over and absolutely no more parties, and she had to get a part-time job to start paying off her mistake.    
    
I wanted to teach her to take responsibility for what she'd done, and that meant no exceptions to the rule. It isolated her from her friends, I admit, but that was the consequence. She hadn't paid me back by the time prom came around; she tried to persuade me to let her go, but I was firm. She was basically grounded right up until she moved out.    
    
The thing is, she's basically resented me ever since. It feels like we haven't had a single pleasant conversation in nine damn years; she refused her college fund because she didn't want anything from me (she chose not to go to college at all - she went full-time at her job after HS); and even now it feels like every other conversation we have is her complaining about her senior year and how unfair I was. I've tried getting her to understand it was her own consequence, that I did it because I love her, the works, but she's still convinced it was all just me being awful.    
    
What's really brought things to a head is that recently her and her boyfriend had their first child. I've offered to help with anything they need, but I've been rebuffed at every turn, and when I asked if they were sure my daugher blew up on me. Apparently I'm not allowed to see my own granddaughter until I ""accept that how I treated my daugher is wrong"" and apologise for grounding her and forcing her to miss prom; my own kid told me that until I did that, she didn't trust me to look after or even be around her child in case I treat them ""the same way"".    
    
I told her that was enough; that of course I'd never be cruel to a baby or young child, that the punishment she earned was appropriate, and that she needed to accept she ruined her own damn senior year by being immature and doing things behind my back. In response, I got a long text from her and another from her boyfriend about how I'm an asshole and apparently I ""haven't changed"", and how I'll never be in their kid's life now. I've been talking about it with some close friends since, and while some of them are on my side, others have said I was too harsh on my kid at the time and that she's allowed to be upset. I've also had angry messages from some other family members about it, as well as some of support; it seems everyone's picking sides now.    
    
So, AITA?",bigfun1967,2380,0.8700000047683716,3092,1698794063,2023-10-31 18:14:23,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ky8my/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_needs_to_get/,10,2023
176kogp,AITAH for feud w/ deceased husband's ex??,"My husband and I were married for 12 years before he passed away. We have 2kids together. He also has 2 kids from a previous relationship. When he passed away his ex expressed wanting to keep things the same and have the kids spending time together. However she meant the custody schedule meaning I still have her kids 50% of the time. I missed my husband and was always close with my step kids so I agreed. 3 years have passed and his kids are 15&16 and I still want them in my life however I want to start forming my own habits, traditions and vacations without her imput such as vacations on ""her off time"" and not taking them, me not spending enough on birthdays, her asking me for money for their sports and interests. 

When I brought this up she threw a fit, literally said I was abandoning them ""just like their dad"" and I'm showing my true colours and clearly I never loved them like I said I did. I explained they can still come over and will still have their own rooms but if I want to up and go to my parents that live hours away I don't want to have to clear it with her anymore because I also don't want them at my house unsupervised (not because I don't trust them but because they're still young). 

She has literally hired a lawyer and is trying to establish that I agreed to a custody arrangement and she wants child support since we always had more money. My husband had money set aside for his kids when we met and when he died I sold assets that were his and split the $ between all 4kids. His life insurance was also split in 5 for all of us. The house was mine so it was never written to be left to his kids. 

The estate lawyer set it up where they get money at a certain age and she got monthly amount to help raise them. I dont believe I owe her more. Some people in our life are split since it seems like I did agreed to custody but I was just trying to be a stable figure for them still. 

Am I wrong for wanting her to screw off and not wanting to give her anything?? This whole thing seems ridiculous but her lawyer is attacking me???

178rrnv,WIBTA if I said I had a problem with my fiancée adding a ring enhancer to the engagement ring I just gave her?,"I’m not sure how I should feel here.

Last week I celebrated my 2 year anniversary with my then gf, & really went all out to make it an amazing weekend getaway, finishing it all off with a surprise proposal at the very end.

I got her a beautiful ring, simple classic style with smaller diamonds running down on the face of the band with a 1ct diamond sitting on top, it also came as a set with a matching wedding band that really makes the whole thing look amazing. I basically worked 2 jobs for months to be able to save up and buy this for her along with the rest of the weekend plans. The proposal went great, she was completely surprised & I even had a photographer lined up to be there inconspicuously to capture the moment without her noticing.

All week long after, she’s said how much everyone is telling her they love the ring & giving me kudos on the selection, etc. I didn’t have much to go off for figuring her style out because she’s not huge on wearing jewelry, which game me some anxiety regarding that so hearing that made me feel a lot better.

The ring size was a tad bit big so we had planned for her to get it resized sometime this next coming up week. Fast forward to today, she goes to church with her mom and is taking her & her daughter to a museum while I’m at work. While at her mom’s house, suddenly she texts me saying she might not need to have her ring resized after all now because her mom just gave her a nice ring holder to keep it in place, & sends me a picture of this ring guard/enhancer that, admittedly is very nice, but it almost swallows up her whole ring finger and completely changes the entire appearance of the ring I just gave her.

I told her I don’t think that is going to work after we add the wedding band to the ring, to which she replied she thinks can be split further apart to make that space. She then tells me I didn’t like it she didn’t have to wear it, but in the same text says she really loves it  and mentions this ring holder her mom is giving her is $3,000 so it was a very nice gift. 

Well, not that the monetary value is what matters here, but I spent just shy of 10 grand on her engagement ring/wedding band and diamond set. So I’m a little offended that she even feels the need to add the enhancer to it, which I’m still not positive will accommodate the wedding band after that is added after the wedding. & I just don’t like the fact that a wedding/engagement ring is meant to be from me and she wants to add more to it from someone else, even it it is her mom. To me, the enhancer is so big completely swallows & hides the ring itself.

AITA for feeling like this? Should I pretend it doesn’t bother me & hope I’ll get used to it, or that she’ll decide on her own to stop wearing it?  I’m worried she will take it this the wrong way if I try object to it, so hoping for some guidance on how to best approach it if my feelings are valid.",JackkHammerr,2262,0.9300000071525574,2066,1697411348,2023-10-15 18:09:08,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178rrnv/wibta_if_i_said_i_had_a_problem_with_my_fiancée/,10,2023

175rrgb,AITA for telling my friend’s GF to stop this shit when she pulled out tarot cards?,"I put a TLDR right at the bottom

My (24m) best friend Lewis (24m) has a girlfriend who is super weird, not just in the way she acts but her whole personality too. She believes in tarot cards, palmistry, crystal energy and all that sort of crazy stuff.

He started to bring her to group meetups & she seemed like a relatively chill person, she was just chatting and smoking some pot and stuff. One time when I was at Lewis’ house though she started to ask me what my zodiac sign is & telling me what crystals “match my energy”. There was another time when one of our other friends was going through a breakup, and she just straight up said to him “i guess that’s what happens when a Virgo dates a Aries”.

It’s just my personal opinion that anyone who believes in this stuff probably has a screw loose up there. But I didn’t say anything cause that’s his girlfriend. She started to talk about this shit more and more. 

I invited Lewis round to my house one day and when he arrived his GF was there too. I wasn’t rude or anything, but also wasn’t super friendly to her because I didn’t even invite her. For a while we were watching a movie, until she pulled out a pack of those tarot cards.

She started telling me that she wanted to give me a reading, I said no thanks. But she started pushing saying that she just wants to see what my reading comes out as. I think the fact that this was in MY house and that I hadn’t even invited her made me fly off the handle, and I ended up saying loud, but not shouting at all, “I have a reading for you : stop with this shit and get real”.

She asked if I was being serious and Lewis thought I was joking. I kept a straight face and said I wasn’t, and that I was fed up with all this psycho shit. His gf started crying & calling me names and Lewis said “why are you being such a dick” before leaving.

A few other friends that know us all have literally agreed with me, saying that she tries to push that shit on anyone and they’re fed up too. But some others say that I should have just let her do it to get it over and done with. AITA?

TL;DR - My best friend’s GF believes in crazy spirituality shit. When she tried to give me a tarot card reading, i said no but she kept pushing. i finally told her “I have a reading for you : stop this shit and get real”. They got upset, but some of my friends don’t blame me. AITA?

Edit because I forgot to mention and someone’s comment made me remember : I don’t know if this is true or not but Lewis has said to us once that his GF has some kind of personality disorder but wouldn’t specify what. Idk if that’s part of the reason for her behaviour (I see some people saying that I’m assuming she has a personality disorder because she likes tarot, PLEASE READ PROPERLY. I said that Lewis has literally said to us that she has one, not that I think she does).

Last edit : wow I went to sleep, woke up and checked my post not too long ago and I’m very very surprised at how much attention it got. It seems to be mostly ESH but because there’s LOADS of responses I can’t really tell. I understand now I went too aggressive and should have just said no again. I guess that the fact it was in my house and she wasn’t invited along with the things she’s said to me & my friends in the past (e.g the example i gave at the start when my friend broke up) was what made me get angry a lot faster. I’m gonna apologise to Lewis (idk about her though) and then see where our friendship goes from there.

I got angry and told him he was being sexist and that I wasn't his maid. He said I was overreacting and that it was just an innocent joke. He said I had no sense of humor and that I should relax.

I walked away from him and went to the living room. His sister (my sister-in-law) noticed that I was upset and asked me what had happened. I told her the truth, and she was furious. She said her brother was an idiot and that she was going to talk to him. She told the other women in the family what he had said, and they were all outraged. They all went to talk to him and criticized him for the sexist joke. He felt embarrassed and tried to justify himself, but no one accepted it.

174yb8g,AITA for not defending FIL in a feud on my pregnancy announcement post?,"When I announced my pregnancy on social media 3 weeks ago, FIL was upset that baby would be taking my last name. He commented that his last name sounded “much better.” My brother and a couple friends responded to him. They told him he was being weird and he insisted it wasn’t weird to expect his grandchild to have HIS last name. My brother called him stupid (not saying I agree with this but it happened) and it snowballed from there. 

I never once intervened but my MIL called my bf to complain about me. She said they’re tired of dealing with me, they refuse to keep eating my “shit sandwich” and they will not walk on eggshells. She was upset her husband got attacked in my comments. I ended up taking the phone and told her it was not my responsibility to moderate a feud that he initiated and publicized on MY announcement post. Basically we argued for an hour. She insisted I was in the wrong, I should’ve stuck up for him and I had no reason to be so upset and I am too sensitive (no one ever even told her I was upset?). 

I called FIL after because MIL told me that’s what I should do. He told me he doesn’t give a fuck about me or the baby anymore as it won’t have his last name. 

I really don’t see the issue in me not defending him.

16z7mz7,AITA: I told my pregnant sister I'm upset for not being made the godmother and not being able to help in the planning of the baby shower.,"My sister, let call her Anne (31) is 3 months pregnant.  Anne is my only sibling and this is her first baby. My dad pass away 4 year ago and it  only been mom, Anne and me for a long time. Mom and I have been really excited to welcome a new member of the family. Since Anne is my only sibling, I thought (assumed) I would be the baby's godmother. My sister made it seem I would until her husband told her I would need to be married in order to be the godmother. I'm very much single and have no plans to marry. I  don't think it in the cards for me. I was sad to hear this  and kept how upset I was to my self. If the catholic church says I can't be a godmother then who am I to argue. I took Anne to the Prego Expo, along with our mom. We started talking about the baby shower and doing a little planning during and following the expo. Today I go a text message from Anne, telling me the date and location of the baby shower. I asked her why she was doing it in that location since we talked about another location. She said her husband's brother and his wife liked that place and they wanted a DJ at the baby shower and for it to be a party. I was taken a bit back since I thought mom and I would be doing the planning. Especially since mom will be paying for the location and she has a limited income.   Anne then proceeded to send me screen shots of table center pieces and shower decorations that she wanted me to make for the shower. I was upset and it took me a minute to understand why I was crying. My plan was to ignore her for a few hours while I settled my feels. But she kept messaging, demanding a response and I finally texted her back. I told her I was upset about not being a godmother and that I felt her husband's family was taking over the planning and how my feelings where hurt. Anne texted back that its her husband, that she never confirmed the location and that I'm making no sense. I texted Anne back, telling her that  helping plan means involvement, and that I felt like I was not involved instead I was being told when things are happening and rudely being told I needed to do the decorations.  I also texted Anne that I clearly misunderstood my level of involvement and that I felt I was justify upset but that I will get over it. She has not responded.  My mom is now mad at me for upsetting Anne and she worried it will affect the baby. So now I feel like crap. I know it's Anne's decision on how much I am or am not involved in. My feeling where hurt and I should have kept them to myself since Anne is pregnant and it can affect her baby... Am I the asshole...

1780gxt,AITA for not telling my niece that I’m her biological mother?,"I (30F) had a baby when I was 14. I chose not to abort, but soon after she was born, I realized that I could not handle having a baby while being a freshman in high school. My older sister (26 at the time, now 42) and her husband can not have biological children. They adopted my baby when she was three months old and I gave up all my rights to her. It was a difficult decision but it was right for me and her. I no longer see her as my daughter, but as my niece. She does not know that I gave birth to her.

A few days ago, I was having dinner with my mother and she suggested that I tell my niece that I’m her biological mother because she’s sixteen now and old enough to understand. I refused. I have a good relationship with my niece and I’m afraid that revealing the truth will ruin our relationship because she might think I abandoned her. I love her as my niece but do not have any maternal feelings for her anymore. She is my sister’s daughter and I don’t want to ruin their family either.

My mother has continued to insist that I tell her because she has a right to know. She’s older than I was when she was born and my mom thinks she’ll understand. I disagree. I was a child then and she’s still a child too. She doesn’t need to know yet.

17h8pmw,AITA for telling my husband he doesn't deserve to be a father because he wasn't excited to be in the delivery room with me?,"My (26f) husband (29m) have been together for 4 years and I am currently pregnant with our first child due in the next couple of weeks.

When I got pregnant, I told my husband I wanted my sister (29f) to be in the delivery room with me. My sister is my best friend and I wanted to share this moment with her. Because the hospital we're going to has pretty small delivery rooms, mothers are allowed only 1 birthing partner. My husband was upset and kept asking me to reconsider because he wanted us to meet our child together. I understood where he was coming from but I was firm that I wanted my sister there and her support. He eventually got over it and I thought it was a thing of the past.

A few days ago however, my BIL's father passed away in his native country so both he and my sister travelled there for the funeral. Since this happened all of a sudden, my sister told me she is not sure she can make it back for the birth and needs to help her husband and his family sort through the estate. I was disappointed of course. I told my husband he could in the room with me. He just replied 'ok'.

That caught me off guard because he really wanted to be in the room when we talked about it a few months ago. I told him I thought he would be more excited. He said he's just my ""sloppy seconds"". I asked him what's that supposed to mean. He said I value my sister more than him and only see him as a backup because my sister can't help me out. I told him that's not true but then he brought up how my sister values her husband more than me and I should learn how to treat him from her. This started an argument and since then he's been a bit cold towards me. I talked to my best friend and she said I was wrong to ask my sister to be in the room before my husband.

17010zf,AITA for telling my husband I would have been better off hiring a babysitter?,"I have been married to my husband for 3 years and together for 7. Our only child is 2.5 years old and the last two years have been a struggle. This past weekend my husband admitted that he thought we had decided that I would make the child-rearing decisions and that he would ""help"" when I needed it. I was livid. I told him he had just defined ""default parent."" He did not think it was a bad thing that I make all the decisions for our child and he ""helps"" when I struggle. Cut to last night - I took two hours after work to get a run in with friends. This had been planned for a week and husband said he was cool with it. I came home to a house in disarray, table had not been cleaned from dinner, daughter had not had her bath, and other than ordering pizza for dinner, no other forward motion had been made to get our child into any sort of nighttime routine. I should add that my MIL was at the house as my husband had called her over to help. Husband jokingly says - ""we didn't get anything done."" I bit my tongue until this morning after a fitful night of interrupted sleep with our toddler (her sleep is off, but that's an entirely different post) - and I told him that I would have been better off hiring a babysitter the night before because a teenager could have accomplished more. He was defensive and responded that it was just a hard night. I get that, our kid is 2, so much of it is hard. I also know that when he plays in sports leagues 1-2 times a week and watches football at a bar 1-2 nights a week - I somehow manage to cook dinner, bath our child, brush her teeth, clean as I go, and get her calmed down if not totally in bed.

17k5zqa,WIBTA if I get married in my friend’s wedding dress?,"I (29F) am getting married next May to my boyfriend of 11 years (29M). We have been engaged since the birth of our kid 5 years ago. Due to a number of circumstances, chiefly finances, we have had a long engagement.

I have been friends with Caitlyn (31F) since grade school, and although we are not “best friends” we have had a long and joyful friendship that means a lot to me. I went to Caitlyn’s wedding to her college sweetheart, which happened when she was freshly graduated at 23.

Unfortunately, her husband was found in a bathroom stall with his coworker at the reception. My heart broke for her, and I was part of her support system in the aftermath. She is now happily remarried with two kids of her own.

In planning my wedding, the one thing I’ve been struggling with for years is the dress. My body image is poor, and I have an unusually large chest that makes all clothes shopping awful. But I went thrift shopping last week, and found THE DRESS. It was everything I could have dreamed of, and it FITS ME! I literally fell to my knees crying in the dressing room. Right away, I sent a photo to everyone I could think of, including Caitlyn. She called me immediately. I didn’t see it then, but when I got home, I saw that I had multiple missed calls and texts from Caitlyn.

So, it’s her wedding dress from her marriage to her ex. Apparently, she finally decided to let go of it. Since it was so long ago, I genuinely didn’t recognize it. It’s also not as if she goes around parading her wedding photos. Once she said it, I remembered right away. It also made sense, as one of the things she and I bond over is boob size. I tried to laugh it off, but she said, “I’m sure they’ll let you return it, under the circumstances.” I felt sick to my stomach because it was obvious she didn’t want me to wear the dress, and I was already super attached to it.

I stopped engaging for the rest of the night and talked it over with my fiancé and some other friends. Opinions are split. Some know how hard this process has been for me, and think Caitlyn is being petty. Honestly, I don’t. I get where she’s coming from. But I literally cannot keep looking. And it was $30. I have a 5 year old. I would love to spend wedding dress money on her instead.

Some say that it’s not only a bad omen, but disrespectful to ask Caitlyn to look at me in her dress. Imo, Caitlyn has moved on and has a family. If the roles were reversed, I would be thrilled for her. That said, I do understand that I could be the AH by reminding a friend I do love of one of the worst day of her life.

I tried talking to her about it the next day, but she has been firm on not attending my wedding if I wear the dress. She actually said she is rethinking the friendship in general. I am gutted, and don’t really think that’s fair. I would love to find a solution that allows me to keep the dress and my friend, which is why I am posting here. AITA? What can I do?",Careful-Border-4986,1188,0.9100000262260437,718,1698705868,2023-10-30 17:44:28,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k5zqa/wibta_if_i_get_married_in_my_friends_wedding_dress/,10,2023
17ioa5q,AITA For Not Giving Stuff To People Having a Second Kid?,"I got SO MUCH of the same stuff that are extras and I'm trying to sell them on Marketplace for some extra cash because we are struggling a bit right now, as bfs hours may change.

My MIL informed me of someone in the family who is expecting a baby any day now *this was a few weeks ago, she's now had the baby, which is apparently their second or third kid, according to my Bf* 

My daughter is now in size 4 diapers and we had a package of 3s left, I have no problem with her bringing that to the family member, I've given away free diapers before just because our baby shower had an amazing turnout and we didn't need to buy diapers until the 5month mark. 

Anyway, my MIL sees me listing this bundle, it includes 3 teethers, a toy I have THREE of, and do not need another of, and a 3 month clothing item. I'm selling it for $15, which is cheap considering the entire bundle is $30-$40. I also said I'm giving away more 0-3 or 3-6 freebies if they buy the bundle. Kids are expensive, kids!! 

She calls me, furious that I didn't think to give the bundle to the family considering they have a girl. I asked my boyfriend beforehand if it's their first kid, or second? I feel that that matters mostly because it shows they either do, or don't need it. My MIL is PISSED saying ""How dare you assume they can't afford this child! How stupid do you think they are!?"" I tell her, I'm sorry, but when people plan to have a second (third???) Child together, typically they make sure they can afford it. I also have over 11 listings to try and bring in around $70, I want to give my daughter a fantastic birthday/Christmas.

She's not happy I'm not giving away the bundle. So, AITA?

Edit; OK, I'm getting mixed responses here saying I'm TA about my attitude towards having second children. In my opinion, if you can't afford kids, you should not have them. So many women/families can/are living off of welfare with 6+ kids being neglected. Also *huge disclaimer* I'm not just giving away gifts from the baby shower. I'm giving away all the extras or things that simply do not and will not fit. She has at least 100 outfits, many of which are duplicates! 

Edit #2, I guess since people don't understand what i am saying; 
I am solely referring to people who legitimately take advantage of the system, people who are drug addicts with no business having children (hiya, that's me, I was born to a drug addict and adopted!) People who FAKE disabilities, people who sell their food stamps, I could keep going on. Because it's very true people take advantage of the system. I am not one of those people. I am trying to get on disability and also still work part time to provide, due to a chronic illness that popped up immediately after pregnancy and hasn't ceased since. I understand why people would find me to be a hypocrite, but when I say we have so and so to our name, this is genuinely the first time it has ever happened, as my free phone STB and I need a phone plan; it's not like I'm a lot of people, who DONT use protection then are shocked Pikachu face that they're not invincible to getting pregnant, and, again, up until this point we've had assistance such as snap, wic, medicaid, and hopefully soon SSDI. 

Edit #3; I see what many of you are saying and why my attitude about eugenics is wrong. One person even said I as being racist (????????) It's definitely hypocrisy, but at the end of the day, the entire reason I'm not giving these people the things I'm selling is because #1, ive never met them, #2, bf has never met them, #3, I already gave them a package of diapers, and #4 I automatically assume if this IS their second or third kid... well, then, you would hope that they would still have some things leftover from the first, money saved up, (ik, ik, hypocrisy because for the first time ever we are struggling. Thankfully our child has everything under the sun and more) financially well off, etc ",Chickpeapee,1143,0.8600000143051147,560,1698530495,2023-10-28 17:01:35,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ioa5q/aita_for_not_giving_stuff_to_people_having_a/,10,2023
