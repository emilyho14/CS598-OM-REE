1ihv09r,AITA for correcting a friend when she said she “re-homed” her cat?,"My friend told a story about re-homing her cat because it wouldn’t stop going to the bathroom on her bed. 

She said she put the cat in its carrier and left it outside the door of a local salon before they opened. She said she checked in later, and one of the girls had decided to adopt the cat, so the re-homing was a success. 

I told her that what she did was not re-homing, and that what she had actually done was dump her cat. I told her that re-homing involves finding an owner and vetting them in advance. 

She got very angry at me for “judging” her. Am I the asshole? ",anon_mouse82,26053,0.9800000190734863,1046,1738709432,2025-02-04 16:50:32,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ihv09r/aita_for_correcting_a_friend_when_she_said_she/,2,2025
1iy5n9x,AITA for asking my GF if she can take a shower?,"My GF really only showers once a week, twice if I'm lucky.

Typically we go to the gym together, and I've often asked her why she doesn't shower, and she always comes with things like ""Oh women don't really sweat much, and I sweat very little even for women's standards"". And I don't buy it, because I can smell. I used to just suck it up, because I know she's extremely sensitive. Kinda NSFW here but, this even affected our sexlife. I used to love going down on her, but after not showering after workouts/long work days etc I've lost interest. 

Fast forward a bit. She now starts using the sauna at the gym. Maybe on average 2 times a week.  
She. Still. Refuses. To. Shower. I've said ""There's just no way you don't sweat in the sauna, just me sitting 5 minutes in there gets me soaked"". She says she doesn't sweat much there either. And she sits there for 20 minutes.

Things are now worse. I can smell her, very badly. Almost to the point where I try not to breathe in too close to her because it's not good. I've tried so long to give hints to get her to shower more, like: ""Hey do you want to take a shower together ;)?"" But she can't take the hint, and says ""Why would we do that, there's only room for 1 under the water anyway""....

One evening, she wanted to lie down on the floor, and stare at a world map she has. She invited me to lie down next to her, and just talk about where we want to go etc. I lasted for about 1 minute, before I had to make up some dumb excuse as to why I had to get up. She then get's upset and says something along the lines of ""Why are you leaving? You never do stuff with me"" The truth is just I can't be close to her for long.

I'm not even sure if I started to resent her, because it was only this one thing that was bugging me in the relationship. But maybe I did, and that's my fault for being bad at communicating to her.

Anyway, I couldn't hold it any longer. I tried one last time to ask if she wanted to take a shower with me, to show I did want to do stuff with her, but she declined. Then I said ""I know you say you don't sweat, but I can smell. I don't like the smell of sweat etc and it being a popular gym we go to, I would just appreciate if you showered a bit more"". 

She freaked out. WW3 started. She accused me of things and asked if I found her disgusting etc. It almost felt like she wanted me to think she's disgusting for some messed up reason? Like this was an easy way to create distance between us, have less sex, and all that. I'm not sure, maybe I'm overthinking it. It's just to me, it feels awfully obvious to shower if not daily, at least every other day. She said she doesn't want to shower her hair often, but still, you can shower your body. 

Our relationship is borderline over because I hurt her, so AITA? What could I have done differently?

^(Irrelevant but: Is it normal that women shower less than men? I was always under the assumption it was the opposite.)",john4844,14479,0.9599999785423279,3863,1740517106,2025-02-25 14:58:26,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iy5n9x/aita_for_asking_my_gf_if_she_can_take_a_shower/,2,2025
1iucy76,AITA for not explicitly stating my punch is non-alcoholic?,"I (25F) recently attended a potluck-style work party, and brought punch, which has since caused a problem between myself and another coworker (42F), who we’ll call Sandy.
Last week, my boss hosted a party at his house to celebrate the end of the busy season, and a job well done. All of my coworkers and their spouses were invited, and we decided it would work well to do a potluck to offset the cost of feeding everyone (about 35 people, since not everyone who came brought a spouse or significant other). I volunteered to make a punch that I’ve brought to previous work events that everyone said they enjoyed, as well as some fruit to go with it. This was a casual party with alcohol present, but since I have some coworkers who don’t drink, I didn’t add any alcohol to this punch, and figured that if people really wanted some they’d just add it themselves. Fast forward a couple hours, and Sandy is getting even louder and more dramatic than normal, and is stumbling around the party. I didn’t think much of it and figured she brought her own drinks, or was adding some of the hosts alcohol that was put out into something else. She suddenly fell off the chair she was sitting on, and made a big show of saying that it’s because she was so drunk- she then asked me, in front of the rest of our coworkers, what it was that I put in the punch. I was confused, and told her what was in it (just a mix of gingerale, 7up, orange juice, and a can of juice concentrate), and she wanted to know what alcohol I put in it, because she’s been drinking it all night, and is “really feeling it”. I told her that I didn’t put any alcohol in it, and asked if maybe someone else had spiked the punch bowl- nobody said they added anything, and one of my coworkers who doesn’t drink even said that they’d also been drinking the punch all evening, and was still completely sober. I also would like to clarify that I understand how context can matter, like if everyone else was really drunk then that can make even a sober person feel like they’re loaded, but that definitely was not the vibe- Sandy was the only person acting “drunk”. She then got really quiet, and went by herself to the bathroom. The rest of my coworkers and I exchanged some awkward glances, and tried to laugh it off. She left shortly after, and I received an angry text from her about how I shouldn’t have embarrassed her like that, and that now she looks like an “idiot” in front of our bosses, and the rest of our coworkers. She’s been hostile to me at work ever since, and is basically refusing to talk to me. I didn’t think I did anything wrong, and most of my coworkers agree with me, but some say that I should have just let her go on thinking that the punch was alcoholic to save her the embarrassment, and I’m wondering now if I’m in the wrong.

1iwn9y6,AITA for telling my girlfriend I wouldn't make her coffee anymore unless she stops micromanaging me?,"So, for context, I (24M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for about two years, living together for roughly six months. Normally, we have a good routine: I wake up first, make coffee, and she wakes up to a nice hot cup. Recently, though, she started getting really particular about how she wants it done. She insists on using this super specific method: measure the grounds to the exact gram, pre-warm the mug in the microwave for 30 seconds, add the milk at a certain temperature, and on and on.

At first, I tried to oblige because hey, if she loves coffee that much, I want to make it nice for her. But it got to a point where every time I handed her a cup, she'd grill me: ***“Did you weigh the grounds first?” “Did you warm the mug?” “Is this whole milk or 2%?”*** If anything was off, even by a tiny bit, she'd sigh and say it wasn't as good as “the right way.” One morning, she literally took the mug from me, dumped it down the sink, and started the process herself—while ranting that I *never* do it the right way.

I got frustrated and told her, “If you’re going to be this picky, just make your own coffee. I’m done making something only to be told how it’s ‘wrong’ every time.” She got upset and said I was overreacting, that she just wants her coffee a certain way, and that I should respect her preferences. I argued that I *was* respecting her preference—I just didn’t appreciate the constant criticism or micromanaging. She accused me of being lazy and unaccommodating.

Now, I’m feeling guilty because I do want her to enjoy her morning coffee, but I’m also tired of feeling like I’m a barista under constant scrutiny. AITA for telling her she can just handle it herself until she stops micromanaging me? Or should I just suck it up and follow her super detailed instructions?",No_Reputation1738,12283,0.9700000286102295,2206,1740351896,2025-02-23 17:04:56,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iwn9y6/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_i_wouldnt_make_her/,2,2025
1ivwpqc,AITA for asking my friend to give back a gift I gave her after she openly expressed that she would be getting rid of it?,"I (27 F) have been friends with this girl (we'll call her Mary- 28 F) since high-school. Recently I was back in our hometown and she invited me to her birthday brunch to celebrate her 28th b-day. One day on my way home I happened to stumble across an estate sale where I found a set of really nice, crystal champagne glasses that were in really good condition and cheaper than their worth. Mary lives a high quality fancy lifestyle, so I thought they would be perfect for her, especially because they were within my budget (at the time I had been recovering from student loans and just put down a deposit on my first apartment in the city).

Fast forward to the brunch, we had a really good time and I got to catch up with Mary and other friends from high-school. Mary was eager to open the presents, and when she got to mine, she seemed to enjoy them, asking me where I got them since there was no label. I explained that I didn't know the brand, but the person running the estate sale had assured me that they were authentic and had been a wedding gift to the previous owners. At the mention of the estate sale, Mary became visibly disgusted. Although she didn't say anything to my face, she was very passive aggressive towards me for the rest of the afternoon. I overheard her whispering to some of the other guests about how I had the audacity to give her a used item and that she would be discarding them later.

  
After the event was over, I approached her privately, not wanting to make a scene and asked that if she wasn't going to use the glasses, if she could give them back as I would put them to good use and know their quality. She flipped out and told me it was extremely rude to ask for them back and it was not my business what she did with them.

My family is understanding and thinks that I did nothing wrong, but some mutual friends also at the event think otherwise. So, am I the a-hole?",cereal4dinner12,8680,0.9700000286102295,714,1740268492,2025-02-22 17:54:52,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ivwpqc/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_give_back_a_gift_i/,2,2025
1ih16sq,AITA for refusing to give back a family heirloom?,"A few years ago, my mom gave me a beautiful gold bracelet that originally belonged to my grandma. It had been passed down to my mom, and my mom told me she wanted me to have it because I was the ‘responsible one’ (I'm the oldest of her children) and would appreciate it the most. I was honored and have worn it regularly since.

Now, my younger sister (22F) is getting married, and my mom decided she wants the bracelet back so she can give it to my sister as a wedding gift. I was shocked because, as far as I knew, it belonged to me now. My mom keeps insisting that it was never meant to be ‘permanently’ mine—just in my possession until it was time to pass it on. But she never said that before.

I refused to give it back, saying that if she wanted it to go to my sister, she shouldn’t have given it to me in the first place. My sister is now upset because she thinks I’m being selfish and hoarding the bracelet out of spite.

Most of our family also thinks I'm bitter towards my sister because she's getting married, and I'm unmarried, but that's not the case at all. I'm happy for her, I just want to keep the bracelet as it was given to me first.

1iwmrhj,AITA for embarrassing my parents in public over an allergy?,"I (19F) have been allergic to dairy since I was a baby. My doctor and parents had a whole schedule for the first year of my life to get me acclimated to dairy. It went from me throwing up every night as a baby to the point where I could eat a pretty unrestricted diet and have no real symptoms other than stomach pain when I was in middle school. 

This sounds kind of stupid lol but it took me until a couple of months ago to realise that the stomach pain is actually a symptom and not a thing I just need to deal with. I was on a school trip and asked if I could have the dairy-free meals (because I knew my stomach would feel icky from motion sickness and traveling) and I actually ended up feeling great, so ever since coming back to university I've basically gone dairy-free and my digestion has been great.  However, because I now have lost all my tolerance for dairy, even very little makes me nearly as sick as when I was a really young child. 

I've told my parents this and they basically said ""Do whatever you want at school but we didn't spend nearly two decades getting you used to dairy just to get it out now, that's a lot of time wasted."" I had to go home recently for a family event that my parents hosted and we had a big family meal with a lot of extended relatives where nearly everything had dairy. I tried scraping sauce and cheese off of stuff but I ingested some anyway clearly because I felt gross and spent a lot of time in the bathroom. 

At one point my mother got annoyed at me for leaving the table so much (I was leaving a lot) and said kind of angrily, ""Why are you being so rude at this event?"" This annoyed me because I didn't feel I was being rude, I was sick, so I said to her ""Why don't you take my allergy seriously? You're the reason I've been eating stuff that makes me sick for all my life.""

The issue is that I think that was kind of harsh of me. My parents do believe I have an allergy, they just also believe they cured it with the diet plan my doctor had me on. And they've told me that they only pursued it because my doctor said it could increase my quality of life to not have an allergy--which, to be fair, when I was on this plan I was able to digest more without getting sick, my stomach just hurt a lot. I feel like I may've been unnecessarily rude in how I reacted to my mother, and I'm also worried I drew attention to myself that wasn't needed (a lot of my relatives were asking if I was okay after dinner, which was kind of them but really not the focus of the event).

1inbw35,AITA for not “passing it on” at the food cart?,"I was standing in a long line at a food cart, waiting to get a popcorn refill and the gentleman ahead of me gave his order, then said, “And whatever he wants!” directing his generous smile my way. 

I immediately protested, “Sir, you don’t need to pay for mine.” But he said he wanted to, and I didn’t want it to be a thing, so I thanked him. Then he looked me in the eye and (expectantly) said “Pass it on.”

He smiled again and looked at the long line behind me before turning to get his order. I got my refill of popcorn and said thank you again and he looked so disappointed that I left instead of saying “I’ll pay for the guy behind me.” And he stopped me and seriously said ”Make sure you pass it on someday.” I repeated the words of someone I once tried to pay back: “Pay it forward- that’s what it’s all about.” I thanked him again and escaped.

But I came for the cheapest thing on the menu - popcorn is like two dollars. And there was a large family behind me. And most people were coming in big groups for alcohol. So I might have gotten free popcorn, and I appreciate the gesture, but I might then have had to shell out fifty bucks for beer for a bunch of randos.

And I’ve never liked the “pass it on” thing. It’s generous of the first person, then the last person gets a freebie, but as is often said here, all the middle people get their prices randomized and it’s a headache for the workers.

So I will pay it forward sometime, and I definitely have in the past, but I didn’t play along in the moment and I could tell the man felt his grand gesture was wasted.

1j0isvh,AITA for asking a guest to not crochet at my bachelorette party?,"I'm (28F) getting married this year (yay!) and went on my bachelorette party trip last weekend. The trip was to a cabin-type setting where we all stayed in the same house. I have three bridesmaids, but also invited some friends to come along.

Part of the group is my brother's girlfriend (36F, brother is 38M) of five months who isn't in the wedding party. She wasn't initially invited because I don't know her well and they live in another state, but my brother asked me to invite her as a favor to him. He said that she's never been invited to a bachelorette and likely never would be (I have no idea why, this is just what he told me), and hoped she could have this experience.

Since people would be paying their own way and the group wasn't large, I figured why not. She seemed nice enough.

The problem is that during the weekend, she would insist on crocheting all the time, even during our events and games. When I asked her to participate with us, she said that she took time off for the trip, and wanted to make the most of her ""vacation"" by catching up on her crochet projects. And that playing games and hanging out with my friends wasn't ""fun"" and she didn't want to ""waste"" her days off (all her words, not mine).

To be clear, I don't care that she wants to crochet in general. Most of our activities ended after dinner anyways and we'd just hang out in the living room. I just asked her to saving the crocheting for at night after the activities.

My issue is that she was taking her crocheting with us to places like wine tasting, brunch, a museum tour, etc. It was super disrespectful in my eyes because she'd insist on coming yet wouldn't participate in the activity. Honestly, I was bothered that she was crocheting when we were playing bridal games, but at least that was in our living room!

The trips over now, but apparently she was super peeved that I asked to limit her crocheting time, and my brother's been pestering me to apologize to her for ruining her trip. I personally don't feel like I should, because she shouldn't have come to a bachelorette party if she didn't want to do bachelorette-y things!

But I also love brother very much and I don't want this to come between us. I'm starting to doubt myself because his girlfriend sounds really annoyed with me. Please help!

Edit: I wanted to add some details in case it helps, because I think some people think I'm being a bridezilla: 

1. She was crocheting a throw blanket about the width of my entire arm span. That's what she was carrying with her to dinner, museums, wineries, etc. It wasn't some small thing the size of my palm. She also had the materials for the blanket with her: about five balls of yarn? I'm not sure what you'd call it, but each ball was about the size of a cantaloupe. 

2. We gave her the option to stay home. I told her I wouldn't be offended if this trip wasn't her style and she wanted to spend it crocheting. But she insisted on coming out with us to every single event. 

3. Even though my brother asked me to bring her, she admitted to me that she wanted to come and that she had asked my brother to ask me. 

4. She's doesn't have social anxiety. She just thought our activities were boring and a waste of her time. I mentioned this in another comment, but I overheard her calling my party a ""basic bitch bachelorette"", but I didn't want to confront her because I *didn't* want to cause drama. 

5. My biggest issue isn't that she wasn't giving me attention. Please! I'm a grown adult and already thankful for the friends giving me love and joy during the weekend. I just thought it was super rude to crochet such a big project during group activities. She literally brought her blanket to a museum and crocheted *during* a private tour!",Plane-Presence9361,7341,0.9700000286102295,694,1740778021,2025-02-28 15:27:01,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1j0isvh/aita_for_asking_a_guest_to_not_crochet_at_my/,2,2025
1j0lkc4,AITA for refusing to go to my sisters wedding after finding out only our side of the family were having to pay to attend?,"Obligatory ""this is a throwaway account"" clarification - I'm very active in a D&D sub that I don't particularly want it to tied to this situation. 

So my younger sister (Katie 28F) and her partner (Chris 29M) are getting married in April in Dubai. She has always wanted an extravagant wedding and is going all out on this - so the wedding is happening over 4 days. Theres 70 guests but they they want us (me, my husband, and parents) to stay in the same hotel with them along with her bridesmaids (which I am MOH) and groomsmen - the hotel is pretty lux so with flights is costing us just over £2900 each. 

Chris’ family are also staying in the hotel which includes his parents, two brothers, and his nephew. 

They are well off - I don’t know exactly how much they earn combined but I know Katie is on 88k and she is the lower earner. But about 6 months ago Chris and Katie came to us and asked to borrow 17k more. They stressed it would be a loan paid over time and said the venue had increased the price, Dubai law was different blah blah blah - they paid this money or they lost the lot - we believe them and I offered to loan 7k and my parents the other 10k.

So long story short - I have since found out through someone else that the 17k wasn’t for the venue - it was for Chris’ family to fly over there. They saw how much it was going to be, didn’t want to pay and refused to go. I asked Katie and she confirmed so my first question was if they were paying for his parents why not pay for ours? (I would never expect them to pay for me - even if we couldn’t afford it, I’d have wished them well and stayed at home). And her answer was “because they can afford it”. She got very defensive and said this was the fairest way she could think of doing it, it’s hard enough planning a wedding etc - but when I asked, if you genuinely thought this was the fairest way to do it, why did you lie about what the 17k was for and say it was a venue issue? She couldn’t answer. 

My parents are aware and are very disappointed they lied - but have said they’re still attending - but I have backed out. To me it feels like my parents are being taken advantage - and if they couldn’t afford to pay for both our and Chris’ parents and his brothers and nephew then they shouldn’t have just paid for the 4 parents or no one at all. And they especially shouldn’t have lied about it. 

Katie and Chris keep calling and asking me to attend, saying I’m making them feel bad and ruining their day. But the whole thing just feels… icky to me. 

I’m genuinely and open book so be brutal - am I being an AH here? Should I just suck it up and go? 

Edit*** - Crumbs that's a lot of comments haha - thanks so much everyone. Just wanted to answer a couple of questions/comments that have come up a lot. 

1) the repayment - my husbands brother is a solicitor and he kindly drew up a contract and repayment plan for both myself and my parents so the money will be paid off within 12 months of the wedding. If they don't stick to this I have access to a free solicitor haha. I hope it wouldn't come to that - but that's why I have the papers for worst case scenario. 

2) asking for the 7K back - Imight be a soft touch, but asking for this back feels like a step too far. Like I'm mad as hell but not enough to actively try ruin their wedding a few weeks before which it feels like (right now at least) is what that would be doing. But hey - give me a few more days to stew. 

Edit 2*** 

Thanks again for all the feedback everyone. Just another quick FYI - a few people have asked about Chris' family or seem to have the impression they're well off. 

I'm obviously not privy to their financial situation, but what the limited amount I do know from what Katie has said Chris and his family gree up very poor. Before all this I'd always though Chris was a lovely guy but I had caught him in the odd but harmless white lie (things like where he went to school, the type
Of house he grew up in, etc). I get the impression he is embarrassed or resentful of his upbringing giving their lack of money and this is how he now values his own self worth - by his much money he has. 

My guess is when his family said they couldn't go he panicked and worried people who ask why they weren't there and he would either have to say they couldn't afford it or he couldn't afford to pay for them. And look his past trauma/experience is not for me to judge - but if that were the case it just makes me more mad that they both didn't plan ahead and talk to friends/family about what they could afford BEFORE booking Dubai. If it was such a dealbreaker for his family to be there they should have factored in the cost of paying for all parents to attend instead of thrusting a 3k per person bill at them and expecting them to rock up.

1iryg40,AITA for wearing my wrist brace at work while my coworker has a broken wrist,"
Okay so this is so weird, I (24F) work as a cashier at a sub place, and my coworker last week broke her wrist falling on the ice, so she is in a cast.

When I was 14 I was diagnosed with tendinitis in both wrists, for the most part it doesn’t flare up unless I’m doing a lot with my hands, well I’ve been doing a lot of embroidery recently and as such, have caused a flare up. 

It’s been bothering me for about two weeks and I wear my brace at home, and generally just sucked up the pain while at work, because with my coworker wearing a cast I felt weird about wearing my brace.

Well yesterday it was bad enough I had to wear it at work, as I’m putting my stuff down and getting ready to start my shift, another one of my coworkers who I’ll call Lisa, started to glare at me and asked in the usually snobby tone she uses with me “what is that for”

So I told her about my tendinitis and what it was, she then started to get huffy like I was making it up. Mind you, the coworker who has the broken wrist didn’t care, she didn’t say anything.

1iti2n0,AITA for telling my dad he chose between me and his fiancé when he prioritized her surgery over mine? [UPDATE],"OG post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/YGMXJvjGhl
Hey guys, been awhile. Thanks for your love, I’ve been dragging my feet on an update but here it is. Surgery recovery has been great, I’ve been in therapy since 12, so my therapist knows everything about my dad. Can I just say it’s weird seeing my story posted on other apps with subway surfers and wood work? Love that people think my dad is a sperm donor and not a dad across all platforms.
Senior night is on Valentine’s Day which I’ve told him weeks in advance saying “games start at 7 usually but I would get at the school 30 minutes early since we will probably do it before the game.” I texted his mom(Memaw) to ask him if he was going and he texted her: “oh I never got a date, she doesn’t tell me anything” BULLSH!T! I told her I’ll go NC if he doesn’t go and I will go LC if he does go. If he wants to know? He can fvcking ask and write it in his calendar.
I told my mom to stop staying neutral and tell me why he acts like this, the relationship is almost ruined so there is no point in her trying to save it. He likes to play victim, try to make it sound like my mom doesn’t want him around, uses it as an excuse to make him look like a good guy. I’ve seen text messages when I was younger of my mom trying to get my dad to make an effort, (I showed her the first post so I’ll send her this one too, hi mom, the kindle had screenshots of some convos ily, I saw them in August when I found it so I knew for awhile). I see my mom in a new light now. She will be walking me down the aisle and my first dance, she sacrificed so much of herself for me. She is not only mom but my dad. 
For non Americans, senior night usually involves seniors and chosen people to walk them across the floor. My dad walked me down for my fall senior night, but he will not be one of my people this Friday. I am desperate to keep contact with my sister, I know Memaw will help me with that. I know that if fiancé and dad break up, he will do the same thing to my sister.
Friday came and passed, my dad got p!ssy when he realized I didn’t want him to walk me across the gym floor. He along with Memaw and my sister left during halftime. (We did the walk before the varsity game and pep band can’t leave the stands until third, same as marching band plus Memaw has been to previous basketball games along with football games). I left dad a long voice mail and message Friday for leaving especially since my sister begged to see me and he refused her. I told Memaw I was disappointed that she left when she knew what happens at games.
 Monday I finally sent him boundaries and blocked him. I know I’m going to cry later, this is going to be hard for me. Thanks for your support, it means a lot to me throughout this journey.",Normal_redditorr,4857,0.9700000286102295,158,1740002760,2025-02-19 16:06:00,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iti2n0/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_chose_between_me_and/,2,2025
1irxhxa,"UPDATE: AITA for refusing to help my dad's ex-wife with rent after his passing, even though she is struggling and my half-brother is still a minor?","
[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/3cv9Ud9zK2)

Over the weekend, I realized I was blocked on socials by the ex-wife and also my brother removed me as well.

I reached out to my brother directly because I wanted to make sure he knew that none of this was his fault and that I will always be there for him. I didn’t want to say anything that could damage his relationship with his mom, but I needed him to know that I did nothing against him and that he can always reach out to me.

To my relief, he responded right away and reassured me that he has no hard feelings toward me at all. He already knew that a lot of what his mom told him wasn’t true and even said he was actually happy about the decision I made. He told me that if he were in my position, he would have done the same thing.

One of the most upsetting parts of our conversation was when he admitted that he never liked asking me for money through his mom because it made him feel like a beggar, but she insisted on it. He also told me that she had been looking for an apartment way beyond her budget and had been trying to collect money from different people to afford it, which confirmed my suspicions. I also learned that now they found an apartment within whatever budget she has. 

What really broke my heart was when he said he needed to delete our messages because his mom sometimes checks his phone, and if she found out we talked, she would be very upset with him. It made me realize just how much control she has over him.

I reassured him that the money I was sending for him is still his, kept safely with me, and that when he needs anything, I will find a way to help him—but it won’t be through his mom anymore. He understood and seemed relieved. He also told me that he’s already thinking about his future carefully and wants to choose a profession where he can be financially independent, so he never has to worry about money.

Honestly, I was happily surprised by how mature and self-aware he is for a 15-year-old. Despite everything, he’s handling the situation with so much understanding and perspective, and it makes me even prouder to be his sister.

For now, I will keep in touch with him privately to make sure he knows he is not alone. I told him that when he grows up, I’ll be there to support him, especially for things like university. He knows that no matter what happens, I will always have his back.

Edit: I'm not giving him a debit card or anything as clearly he doesn't need and want it. I will save the money for his future.

I didn't order it so I texted the roomate group chat saying it was outside. One of my other roommates (who I don't get along with) grabbed it since she was home too and put it on the counter (she didn't order it either) after our other 2 roommates got home from my room I overheard her asking if it was theirs and noone in the apartment had ordered it. They were excited about the free food (we are in college) and ate some putting the rest in the fridge. Nothing about the pizza being noones was voiced directly to me but i could hear the conversation. I ate a couple slices the next day and my roomate was mad at me for eating ""her"" pizza even though she only knew about it because I texted and nobody here paid for it.

1izrplx,AITA for refusing to buy my girlfriend another pair of designer shows when she barely wears the first pair?,"In 2023, my girlfriend and I went to Hawaii. At some point, we ended up in a Christian Louboutin store, and I caved—I bought her a beautiful, expensive pair of red-bottomed heels. Not the most extravagant, but still a luxury splurge.

She wore them exactly twice—once prancing around our hotel room and once at the office, where they scuffed a little. I was informed that scuffing is part of the charm (which, okay, sure). But since then? They’ve been living a comfortable, untouched life in her closet.

I’m not mad, but I do poke fun at her about it from time to time for basically keeping them hidden.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, and we’re back in Hawaii. Naturally, we visit the Louboutin store again, and now they have “everlasting” red bottoms which basically resist scuffs.

My girlfriend wants another pair. The salesman enthusiastically backs her up but I say that I'd be willing to get her another pair when she actually wear the first ones.

Now, we're not fighting, but she shares the story with all her friends. She’s been telling me I don’t get it, that luxury fashion is an investment. She insists that one pair isn’t enough because she needs a pair that won’t get scuffed so easily. I told her that sounds like she’s asking me to buy display shoes. Now she’s been giving me side-eye ever since and I'm wondering if AITA for not understanding the big picture with shoes.

So, AITA for holding my ground and not buying a second pair when the first ones are still in mint condition?

1ikz8b3,AITA for calling out my aunt for lying about having a condition that I actually struggle with?,"So some background, this Aunt has a habit of copying everything anyone does and treats it like a competition. This also applies to illnesses. You mention getting ill? she is sick a day later and she always feels worse than you. Then acts like she never knew you were sick

6 months ago I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that doctors think I have been dealing with for years. The only reason they found it is because it very quickly got worse and has ruined my life. It won't shorten it, but I am in so much pain that I can't even walk to the store that is right next to my flat without feeling extreme pain and discomfort. My sleep is awful, my social life has become non existent unless people come to my place. There is no cure for it, I'm on specific targeted medications to try and stop it getting worse, the best we can do is pain management at this point and I'm on the strongest painkillers I can have but it's still bad. 

When I was first diagnosed I posted about it on my FB, not in detail, just said what I had. The only person who knows the details is my mum.

Yesterday mum picked me up so I could visit my nan. while we were there, aunt turned up. We were talking about random stuff at first but then she mentions she went to the doctors and they diagnosed her with  (condition I have) and they think she's had it for years. I thought she was lying so asked her some questions regarding it and every answer was bs. She claimed she told a doctor her symptoms and that's how they found it, when you need bloodwork done to find it. She claimed that they were looking into different procedures to cure it, which again, no cure. When I asked what meds she was on she said there wasn't any they could prescribe for it and she had paracetamol to deal with the terrible pain she was in. 

She then went on about how its affecting her life, its made things difficult for her. Yet she does martial arts 3 times a week and goes clubbing every weekend like she's a teen and posts about it on FB. I lost it. I just went off about how full of it she was and that pretending to have something so serious when I was actually going through it was pathetic attention seeking behaviour. I pointed out everything she said that proved she was lying and said the only medical help she needed was for her head as she clearly had issues. She tried to double down and say that she never knew I had it, (she saw my FB post), she thought I would be more sympathetic as I know what she's going through etc. At this point I was so mad that my mum drove me home. My aunt then later posted on FB about her 'struggles' and how some people just aren't sympathetic about this condition. I called her out in the comments of the post and mentioned what had happened earlier in the day and a load of other family started calling her out for it so she quickly deleted the post. However my cousin (her daughter) is now calling me TA as my aunt is upset I called her out.

1iy63ei,AITA because I get up for five minutes after my fiancé and I have a meal?,"I (23F) and my fiancé (25M) have been living together for almost 2 years. In the last month or so my fiancé has adopted the habit of attempting to clean his teeth after eating by making this sucking noise constantly. It is such a disgusting noise and I can’t stand listening to it. 

For context, growing up I grew up with a grandfather that ate with his mouth open and my grandmother who had issues with her throat. Because of this, for most of my life I was subject to listening to some pretty gross noises while they ate. As an adult, I don’t want to be subject to the same experience if I don’t have to.

I’ve brought it to my fiancé’s attention several times. Every time he acknowledges it and says that he’ll try to stop, he just feels like there’s something in his teeth. I have suggested floss, toothpicks, those portable toothbrushes. Nothing has worked, he still continues to do it.

I don’t really see why I have to force myself to listen to him doing that so after we eat I’ve made it a point to get up and go sit in a different area of the house for five minutes.

We got into an argument about it and he is calling me an asshole because I shouldn’t be getting this upset about something he can’t help. Like I said, I’ve already told him several times that I’m not gonna subject myself to listening to him do that. If he’s not gonna make a more conscious effort to not do it then I’m going to remove myself from situations where I listen to him do that. 

I’m not even trying to make him feel bad or give him this ultimatum, but I don’t understand why I need to force myself to listen to him do something that genuinely makes my skin crawl just to make him feel better. It’s also important to note, it’s not like he does this just after big meals. He does this multiple times a day after eating pretty much anything.

1iqccwe,"AITA for not inviting my friend to a party, after he consistently overstays and breaks all social contracts?","Recently I had some friends over for a party at my house, and notably didn’t invite my friend “John.” I didn’t lie to him, or say that we weren’t doing it, or rub it in his face, I just had some friends over and he didn’t get the invite. 

I felt bad, but at the same time he always stays too late, makes things really uncomfortable for me, and is just a difficult guest to have in my house. I hosted a super bowl party, and he stayed roughly two hours later than everyone else, even though I straight up told him, “parties over dude.” He vapes, he says the n-word (which i don’t think anyone should say, but especially not him) and makes jokes abt some of my mental health issues. 

I love him to death and he’s one of my oldest friends, but it’s at the point where if he’s coming to my house I have anxiety the whole day leading up to it. 

Anyways, he called me during my party and asked me what I was up to, and if I wanted to catch a movie. I said I actually had a couple people over so I couldn’t tonight, and he asked who, I told him and he asked why he wasn’t invited/if he could come, and i said something along the lines of “ehh not tonight man.” He kind of lost his shit at me and sent a bunch of angry texts the next day, which is imo a huge overreaction bc i tried to be as nice as i could about things. 

so ig aitah if i just stop inviting him? 

EDIT: for everyone calling me a racist in the comments; 

some things you should know, that i should’ve included in the original post. he recently had a large personality change seemingly out of nowhere , which included some things like new music taste, excessive working out, and as of LAST WEEK saying the n word. 

i am not a racist, i do not condone racism, or his actions. he HAS NOT been invited back to my house since the first time he said that word, and will not unless he changes some things. i am not “continuing to associate with a racist,” as this is a new behavior, and my other friends feel the same way as i do.

1imjm1v,AITA for telling my ill dad to stop asking me to visit him in the hospital ?,"
I am in my mid 30’s. My parents are really old. My dad is almost 90. My mom is in her 70’s. My dad was in his mid 50’s when my parents had me. Since I was 6 years old, my dad has had major procedures in the hospital. At first it was once every 2-3 years, and within the last 15 years it’s been once a year. In the last two years, it’s been every few months.

My mom got married “later” in life. She lived her life to help her parents. I feel like because she “missed out”, she put unrealistic expectations on me. She pressured me even before I ever met my current husband to find someone and have kids. I had kids, and shortly after my youngest was born she let me know she wouldn’t be able to help me. I expected such with her age, but it was insane to me how even yet still she would ask me to have more. 

My dad has been in the hospital twice now this year for complications from congestive heart failure. My eldest is 3 and my youngest is 16 months. I am able only to see my dad for a short while in the hospital. They call me everyday to ask if I’m coming to see them. My mom sent me a text today in the middle of my work meetings saying “your dad is asking for you.”

I’ve been so exhausted from just raising kids, dealing with issues with my husband, work, cleaning house, potty training, etc. I saw the text and called her and said “why did you send the text?” She said “I’m just letting you know your dad is asking for you.” I responded “has anything changed? Is anything happening?” She said “nothing changed since yesterday” (when I last saw them). 

Is this practical, or normal ? I’m extremely overwhelmed and this is just added stress coming off as manipulation to me. My father just called me in the middle of writing this and asked me why I’m not at the hospital and I responded, in the middle of playing with my kids, “if you wanted me to be by your side all the time why did you all expect grandkids from me? Did you think that my job was just to give birth to them and abandon them once you needed me?”  I feel horrible I said this. My mom made a comment I can find a baby sitter and that she always sees advertisements for baby sitters. I told her that I can’t afford daycare and a baby sitter everyday to come see you. Then my kids will see me less than 4 hours a day.

I hate to add on this part, but — my dad has literally had everything. Heart surgery, intestinal surgery, cancer, a stroke, etc. His health is declining rapidly. But he will be in the hospital for weeks. Not only can I not afford child care to cover me for weeks — I don’t want to. I want to spend time with my kids, especially knowing that … he’s always in the hospital, and my kids are too young in my opinion not to have me for a set amount of hours a day. My mom told me I’m the a-hole for and that I should respect a dying man’s wishes — but he’s been having a dying man’s wishes for 15 years now.

1io3thv,AITA? Mother-In-Law invites self over during lunch and tells my partner later that she was offended we didn't share.,"I (26m) and my partner (44m) just bought a house together. We've been in the process of moving boxes and unpacking in between going to work/school/etc. Our parents respectively have been helping a lot, gifting us the things we didn't have room for in our previous too-small apartment. 

However, my parents help when I ask. They show up when I need them. They don't drop in with a ""Hey I'm coming over."" text. And they certainly don't spend hours following me around while I'm putting things away to tell me that I'm doing it wrong. Nor do they gift us a white bathmat, just to criticize the fact that I actually put it in the bathroom because ""it'll get dirty, it's white."". They also do not criticize my decor choices or spend hours scrubbing things that do not need scrubbed. They also do not tell me how to hang curtains or act like I'm too stupid to do regular handy-chores and yardwork.

You know who does? His mother. 

A few days ago, she sent that ""Hey, I'm coming over text."" right after I started cooking lunch which was annoying, but whatever. She gets there and without prompt tells me that she brought food with her. She says she's gonna have her little sandwich. And while I understand passive-aggressive boomer speak I don't entertain it. She said she had food, therefore I did not offer. 

Upon realizing she had given herself the duty of scrubbing our brand-new and clean bathroom for hours, I did, however, put on some coffee. We're all big coffee drinkers.

Of course, because I made it, it wasn't good enough. She managed to try to take coffee before it was done so it was dripping on the burner while she was pouring it. 

She stayed through lunch (10am, we have breakfast at 4:30am) clear to dinner. She even stayed when my partner left for their study group. 

While I was making dinner I was hoping she'd go home. I was tired of her appearing behind me to micro-manage my unpacking. My partner (who returned around 3pm) and I began talking about how tired we were, and how we needed to take showers, etc because asking her to leave was out of the question. Trust me, I wanted to. 

Eventually, after realizing we did not make her dinner she left. I however did not realize this was the case right away, because she was still talking about how she brought food. And given that she invited herself to do things that didn't need done, I took her word for it. She's an adult, she said she was good and that she had food. She's not an incompetent baby that I need to micro-manage. 

But yeah, she's kinda mad and my partner was agreeing saying we were bad hosts. I do not agree, I think his mom is negative and pushy. And it feels like she finds reasons to show up and be critical. I'm not entertaining this behavior.

1ina65n,AITA for writing so bad my teacher couldn't read it because he didn't let me use my support?,"I (14f) live in the UK and therefore have to do my GCSEs next year. In preparation for these tests, we must do ""mini"" tests with our chosen subjects before. I also happen to have severe dyspraxia. I can talk and ""look normal"" but only as a result of years of OT. I can't run properly or move quickly and the one thing I can't do is write.

My old school didn't teach students to write normally and we were scolded if our handwriting wasn't in cursive/joined up so I never learned to write like the other kids quickly - all my writing is in cursive and I only learnt to write with a fountain pen (the school also didn't allow us to carry non-fountain pens). I manage just fine as I have had a laptop concession and word processor for any writing task that takes longer than 30 minutes and recently taken it up full time as my condition worsened with puberty.

**Heres where my story starts**. My teacher (??M) (we'll call him Mr S) gave out the test papers for a history test - a test that requires 8 essay style questions so naturally I pulled out my device (that I don't normally use in history because there's not a lot of writing - its mostly sheets and bullet points) but Mr S stopped me. He said he didn't see my name on the list of students allowed (even though I am definitely on the list as the only student there with a concession and extra time) and demanded I put my device away or he'd give me a detention.

Begrudgingly, I put it away and decided if he wanted to play, then I'd shoot too. I'm rather petty and this was one of those instances but I feel it was justified.

I opened my paper and while writing my answer, I didn't exert myself. This was an hour long assessment and I knew I'd burn out if I did my ""bestest girlies neatest caligraphy"" so I didn't. I just wrote loosely and didn't clench my hand to the point of cramping.

By the final question, I was exhausted and practically scrawling away so I handed in my sheet and went directly to the head of counseling and welfare. I told her everything and she went to give Mr S a slap on the wrist and re load my name on the god protected list.

Soon after, Mr S reported me to a teacher I'm under for being ""disrespectful"" after my writing was ""unacceptable"" and basically accused me of attention seeking. I have cc (ed) in the welfare department who have my records in the email he sent me and made sure to keep up my teachers pet act I've been building my reputation around for the past 4 years (in front of teachers anyway) and now I'm having the office tell me it was unfair on Mr S who didn't know the severity of my condition and I should've just talked to him (I tried). However, my friends are backing me up.

Its been weighing on my mind so tell me Reddit.

Am I the Asshole?

My teacher didn't believe I had a real problem and forced me to hand write a test.

It feels rather unfair to be expected to fork out that much money (and without any clear lines of communication or early notice to begin with) yet we are being made out to be the enemy. 


Realistically, we will have paid for flights and our wedding outfits + gotten a gift for her so even before the big cost of the accommodation, we will have forked out even more before we even reach the destination!! 


Am I being unreasonable to not want to be in the accommodation because I don't want to pay that kind of money or is there some unwritten wedding etiquette I'm not following?

1il0yux,AITA for telling my SO that her parents getting home from the airport is not my responsibility?,"We’re in the U.K., and my SO’s parents are going to Australia in November. Good for them, I’m pleased for them, however…..

The day they return I have tickets to a gig. For what it’s worth, my SO isn’t going to the gig as she doesn’t like the band in question.

Anyhow, I agreed to take her parents to the airport (she can’t drive) but told her they’d have to get their own way home when they return. 

She has told me that I’m out of order and that they expect me to collect them as I am dropping them off. 

She thinks I should give up my ticket and collect them, I think they should use the train or an Uber. 

Long and short is that my SO and more so her parents think I’m a cunt, and right now the feeling is mutual.

1isp11m,AITA for telling my MIL she can't see her grandchild until at least 6 months old?,"My MIL treated me very poorly after I had our first daughter during the pandemic. I had severe PPD and PPA and eventually I had full blown post partum psychosis. There's alot of things she said & did but her crowning moment was when I was being taken away by ambulance in full blown psychosis and she later referred to this event as a ""barrage of shit"". When i asked her to ""please not say things like that because they're hurtful & mean"" her response was ""you don't tell me how to talk"". My husband and her have a strained relationship and it's been even more strained since this. She has never offered any apology and acts as if she was justified in her actions. When I pointed out that we're all adults and we're all equal she said we weren't equal because ""shes the parent"". Anyways, Im pregnant again with our second and I don't want her around at all post partum. She caused such distress the first time around, tried to pit my husband and I against each other, tried to get my parents involved. She wasn't seeing her granddaughter as often as she wanted so she threw out toys she bought for her, sent back photos we sent of her, I could go on and on. I don't want to deal with it again and my husband REALLY doesn't want to deal with it again. We kept my current pregnancy private-ish until I was 6 months along. During a discussion with my MIL last night she told us she would be staying in town around my due date to ""help out"". We tried to politely decline but she was not taking the hint so eventually we just told her flat out we didn't want her around until baby was a bit older (atleast 6 months old) because we don't want any extra stress. She obviously reacted badly and is calling us toxic monsters (especially me) who are trying to deprive her of time with her grandchild (yet again, she said the same with the first one but reality was that i was really sick and couldn't be around a lot of people and also it was covid). Am I the asshole for holding this boundary? Part of me thinks i'm being to brash. Another part thinks back to all the chaos she caused and I feel at peace with the decision. She's not a terrible person at all, she just handled the situation so poorly that I do not want to go through it again. Husband agrees. So, am I the asshole?

1ig8kit,AITA for not giving straight yes/no responses to my husband’s questions?,"I don’t give a non answer. I give an answer. It just might not be yes/no. It drives my husband nuts. He gets annoyed and I feel like he’s overreacting. Here are some examples:

“Do you want butter and honey on your toast?”
“I want butter and jam”

“Did you want to see a movie tonight?”
“I feel like staying in”

“Is that bill paid for?”
“I actually need to go back and look at that because they sent the wrong amount”

“Did you talk to X about Y?”
“He didn’t call me yet”

Are my types of answers really that bad? Why does he get so annoyed with these answers? (Feel free to convince me to be more sympathetic and change my answers; I just kind of think he’s being overreactive when I am clearly not avoiding the question. It’s like he wants an exact answer to the question. 

EDIT/UPDATE: A lot of people saying I do this intentionally and maliciously. I don’t. It’s a habit of how I talk and answer questions. I am aware it annoys him and I do try to adjust but I don’t always because, again, it’s a habit of talking. It can be difficult to change the way you communicate. It takes time. He also explains why it annoys him (unclear answers, sometimes ambiguous, he has a lot of vagueness at work and would just like some straightforwardness at home, sometimes lack of clarity scares him like wondering if I can’t be more direct with important situations). I understand all this and am sympathetic and do try to adjust. It just feels like a little much when he gets annoyed at something that I don’t see at that big of a deal.

1inbt3w,"AITA for refusing to help my dad's ex-wife with rent after his passing, even though she is struggling and my half-brother is still a minor?","So here’s the situation. My dad passed away 3.5 years ago when my half-brother was 11 years old. My dad and his ex-wife had been separated for about 5 years before his death, but they weren’t legally divorced. During that time, they didn’t really have much contact, and she didn’t join any family gatherings or events. Even during the funeral, she wasn’t there where my aunt, my grandma, and I (32F) were, and I didn’t have a close relationship with her.

My dad was also struggling financially and he didn't left anything behind apart from a small boat he had purchased in my name, which I sold and put the money aside for my brother’s future and started paying towards his needs such as education fees and monthly allowances for him. My dad had still been supporting my half-brother’s mom financially, even though they weren’t living together, and I only had to communicate with her a few times fter his passing about my brother's expenses.

Here’s where things get tricky: my aunt has been paying the rent for my dad’s ex-wife and my half-brother for the past 3.5 years, as my dad’s ex-wife claims to be struggling financially. She works full time but also receives a pension through my dad. Now, the landlord wants them to move out, and my aunt, who has been helping with rent all this time, is not in a position to pay for the rent in the future apartment. My dad’s ex-wife is now asking me for help with rent, claiming she’s still struggling.

I’m honestly conflicted. I don’t have a strong relationship with her, and I don’t feel it’s my responsibility to help her out with rent, especially when I’m already helping my brother. I’ve made it clear that I can’t help with the rent, but she’s persistent and threatening me to tell my brother that I'm this bad sister who is not helping him out with their housing situation and she told me if I'm not helping her out with rent, I shouldn't act like a good sister and help out on anything else as well. I feel like it’s not fair that I should take on this burden when I’m already looking out for my brother’s well-being, and especially when my aunt has already been helping her all this time. My primary focus is on my brother’s future, and I just don’t want to take on any more responsibilities that aren’t my own.

I also want to mention that while my dad financially supported my dad’s ex-wife when they were separated, their relationship was strained, and I never felt close to her. I’m struggling with whether I’m being unreasonable for not helping her, even though she’s in a tough situation.

So, AITA for not wanting to help her out with rent, even though she’s claiming that she is struggling?",Professional-Cry1342,2073,0.9700000286102295,221,1739313906,2025-02-11 16:45:06,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1inbt3w/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_dads_exwife_with/,2,2025
1iucnv5,AITAH for being rude when my wife had a zoom meeting in my office?,"I had a medical procedure this morning/afternoon and didn’t arrive home till about 3PM. While I was gone, we had some cleaners come to our home so my wife relocated from her office to my office where the dogs were being kept. This keeps them quiet. The cleaners left at 1PM so the whole house was available for my wife to have her meetings. Let me add that my wife has a local office, but wanted to work from home today.
The medical procedure makes me very sick, and I needed my medication, which was in my office. When I got home, my wife was still in my office, even though the cleaners were long gone. She refused to even look at me and I could’ve just walked in, but I think she would have gotten angry. I took 15 minutes to do a few quick chores for my wife, came back and she was still in there.  So I stood outside my office and waited. I was there long enough that I decided to just wait in the bedroom. When I came out, my wife was very angry, and sincerely called me the asshole. 
I explained that the cleaners had been gone for hours, and my wife had the rest of the house to have this meeting. She called me an asshole again like this is my fault. I couldn’t get into my office to get my medications, but I am the bad guy. I feel that my wife has terrible WFH etiquette and because of that makes her abrasive to these types of situations.

Sounds great right ?? Absolutely not. I come to find out that she had actually booked the tickets to go to my step sisters wedding in Morocco to marry a man she has known for 3 months. The marriage is a complete sham, my step sister and this mystery Moroccan man had previously agreed to get married so that he could  get a visa, allegedly they fall in love (all within 3 months) and now it’s genuine ???? It also turns out that we leave Morocco the morning after my birthday and my mum “couldn’t book any other flights” (she could they were just on sale so more convenient for her ig). She also didn’t give me a heads up or a choice in this so essentially she was content with ditching me on my 20th birthday (a big one in my opinion) to go to this fake wedding with a women she barely sees and a man she’s never met. My birthday would be rushed and spent packing our bags for the day after, I would have had to also spend the whole week hearing all about this wedding I don’t even agree on and living under the same roof as my stepdad and other step siblings I don’t get on with. It all just feels like it’s been rushed, poorly planned and is convenient for my mum because she gets to cram my birthday in at the end of it. To make matters worse she said it’s too complicated and stressful if I bring a friend when I asked, which is weird as I should have at least one say in what happens on my big day.

1isqjm1,AITAH for taking my dad home after missing a train instead of waiting for the next one?,"My dad (60m), my sister (22f) and I (20m) were supposed to take a train downtown for a car show. I was the one who arranged and paid for everything since I thought it would be good family time.

I told him to be ready at 12:15 pm so that we would have enough time to drive to the station and park before the train arrives at 1:04. The drive is about 25 minutes, so my thinking was that I would have 49 minutes to drive to the station and figure out parking and to get to our terminal (I had never been to this station so just wanted to have extra time incase things go wrong).

He said he would come out to the car at 12:15. My sister and I got to his house at 12:10 and waited. He didn't come out until 12:31. I told him we would be late but he said we were fine since it was a only a 25 minute drive.

We arrived at the station at 12:55. Here's where the first problem came up. We could only find reserved parking spots. We parked in a reserved spot so that I could get out of the car and go find somebody to ask where the regular lot was. Turns out, nobody is in the customer support area as it's a holiday. At this point, it's 1:00.

Then, my dad saw a security officer in the lot and told me to go ask him where the regular lot was. He told me it was at the other side of the road. So, I park up in the regular lot, run back to the boarding area (where my dad and sister was waiting). The doors of the train literally closed as I was about 20 metres from the train. 

My dad and sister didn't board as they saw I couldn't make it. I was upset, but willing to let it go as there was another train coming in an hour. Then, everything got heated. My dad got mad at me for missing the train because ""I should have known where to park instead of wasting time in the reserved lot looking for the regular lot""! Now I was mad. I told him that the reason I wanted to come earlier was because I didnt know the station and where everything was, and since he was late, we didnt have enough time. He said I shouldve researched the parking lot before coming. We got into an argument, which eventually got very bad. At this point I didn't even want to go to the car show as I was so pissed at him for blaming me. I told him that I would wait in the car and that he and my sister could go to the show and I'll pick them up when they come back. He called me selfish as he and my sister got ready for this family outing just for me and that he wanted me to come on the next train as we already made the drive over to the station. I told him no because I was in tears from the argument and wasn't in the mood to spend an entire day with him after he said terrible things to me for something he did.

Eventually, he got in the truck and we headed home. He told me to never speak to him again as I was selfish and wasted his time (he will hold this grudge for at least a month).

1ih278o,AITA for telling my boyfriend my dad was dead,"I (26F) lost my mother to cancer when I was 8 and have always had an absent father. I only found out who he was when I was 13 and even then he did not want custody of me forcing me to stay in the foster system until I was 18. Over my whole life I have had about 5 conversations with him give or take- he is like a stranger to me. He appears once in a blue moon to ask for money or something along those lines. It doesn't really bother me anymore, I've just learnt to accept it now but i don't like talking about it so to avoid that conversation with people i usually just say both my parents are dead.

This leads me to a year and a half ago when I had just started dating my boyfriend (25M) and like usual I had just told him my parents were dead but the other day my dad showed up at my door (I still don't know how he knows where I live) and asked for 100 dollars except my boyfriend was there and he obviously found out my dad was not dead. This lead to a long conversation with him that night where I explained the whole situation.

He said this was a breach of trust between us since I lied about my dad and that he needed some space to rethink our relationship but he doesn't think he will leave me.

I feel so shitty and that I should have told him earlier but I am going to be honest I just didn't think. So AITA?

UPDATE: my boyfriend texted me 5 mins ago asking to talk so we are going to have a full in depth conversation tomorrow after work and I'll update again then :)

  
UPDATE 2 (last update): Before I get to the update I would like clear things up.

1. I have only given money to my dad once when I was still desperate for his love and acceptance but he did not get any money this time.

2. Despite his confusion my bf stepped in to defend me and get my dad to leave and it was only after my dad left he asked me about it

Now onto the update. My boyfriend told me that all the sudden information along with the knowledge I hadn't told him the truth was very overwhelming and he just needed some space to not say the wrong thing. He also said that he got why I lied initially and he wasn't mad that I lied more hurt that I felt like I couldn't tell him about it. He also mentioned that he couldn't be there for me if he didn't know what was going on. The conversation ended in tears and it is the most vulnerable I have been in front of someone. He was very understanding and we have decided to draw a line in the sand and 'start again' if that makes sense.

I have also looked into therapy for my childhood trauma and all in all I am using this as an opportunity to better myself and heal fully.

1imk6md,AITA for telling  my neighbor to stop thinking she is the only one who can do it all?,"I am most likely the asshole.  But parents who think that they are the only ones who can keep the world going tend to drive me crazy.

A little background. I 47 male have had issues with this one neighbor before when she told me that my house gives her anxiety and I have been trying to just avoid her in general. After this one incident I have just avoided her at all costs and if there is anything we need to talk about it goes through the parent’s emails system through the school.

There is a school banquet coming up soon and I have volunteered a couple of times for it. I forgot it was coming up so naturally I didn't say anything. She stopped over the other day to see if I was interested this year. From the past experience my house was in a  
midweek state so kinda organized chaos. She said that she was at another parent’s  
house a couple of houses down from us so she felt it was just easier to just  
stop over than email. I guess it could be believable. 

She asked about the banquet and I looked at the calendar and saw that my stepson was going to begone for that weekend so I told her no I was not going to be helping and that Iwas actually relieved because there is a lot that we have going on right now.  
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF IT. RIGHT???? I thought so. 

Neighbor started on her own tangent about everything she does to manager her house and that includes managing all the kids events. And how she does it all herself with no help. I don't know why she told me all this. I told her and these were my exact words.  
""Well good for you. I'm lucky because in this household we all pull  
together and help one another out. My husband, stepson and myself we all share  
the house responsibilities. Maybe enlist your husband and kids to do the same.  
It might help free up some time."" 

She looked at me like I had a third eyeball and told me nobody knows how to organize the family like she does. I told her well that that was her own fault for making it so that  
nobody could live up to her standards. She didn't really like that answer. I  
told her I needed to get my own stuff done and she needed to go. 

I am now the public enemy number one among the school moms. Which is no big deal to me. It's just a giant clique. But from what I heard earlier I'm an asshole for not understanding what it's like to be a parent these days. This is funny. Last I knew I had three step kids one of which lives with me and my husband full time.

1iinj2v,WIBTA if I told my MIL she could no longer visit my child at daycare?,"My (29F) daughter is five months old and goes to a daycare at my husband’s (32M) workplace. My mother in law also works at the same place so she has easy access to the daycare. At least once a week she goes and spends 30 minutes to an hour just playing with my daughter. This rubs me the wrong way for so many reasons. As a mom, it frustrates me that she thinks it’s okay to just drop by whenever without at least saying something or asking (I actually just found out while writing this that she tells my husband but nobody communicates it with me). As a former daycare worker, I would have hated having someone just come in and spend time with a child because now not only do they have infants to watch, but now they have to work around a fully grown woman and make sure that she isn’t taking pictures/videos of other babies as well. I think my biggest issue is honestly that some days she gets to spend more awake time with my daughter than I do and I know that’s a horrible reason to be frustrated with someone but it is what it is.


Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop visiting daycare so frequently? She comes to our house and gets to spend several hours with my daughter at least once a week so it’s not like daycare is the only time she gets to see her.

1irxbpr,AITA for telling my friend's dad not to walk into my house uninvited?,"I (17f) and my friend (17f) hung out like we normally do at my house. She use to drive herself over, but she hit a deer and totalled her car (she was okay). Friend's dad drops and picks her up now, which was totally fine at first. 

He does this thing - that I think is weird - where he will walk her up to the door, and walk up to the door to pick her up. This was also fine, it may be weird but harmless. 
Recently, he's been rude (in my opinion). He picked up Friend and instead of doing the normal thing of knocking on the door and waiting for us to answer, he just walked in. Now, Friend just walks into my house but she has complete permission, her father does not. 

I talked to my mom about it the first time and she also thought it was very weird. just earlier today he came to get her, and he walked into my house. 
I said somthing along the lines of, ""did you just walk in?? Did you even knock?""

He said we don't respond when he knocks, so I said back that he could've texted or called, which he said we never reply. Not only is that not true, but he has the ability to ping her phone through parental controls. 

Now he says I'm getting too defensive about him walking in and says we're doing something we shouldn't be, but truly I just think it's weird and rude to walk into someone's house, not to mention a safety hazzard, without them opening the door for you when you don't have permission. He told Friend he didn't trust her further and he is obviously now iffy about her coming over here.

Very luckily if he doesn't allow her to come over we only have a few more monthsountil we're adults, but it would really suck. I don't know what to say or do anymore, but I don't think it's right on many levels to just walk into my house, not even my house but my mother's house. 

Tldr; Friend's helicopter dad walked into my house uninvited and without knocking, and thinks I'm too defensive about it. 


Edit/update

I should've clarified this in my original story, but the lock on my front door is slightly broken. It does lock, however it is pretty difficult and often it goes unlocked. I was recently told we don't always make sure the door is locked at night. My parents are aware of this, but my mother's husband isn't really a ""get it done"" Type of guy, and we've been low on funds. 

My house is one floor and it's fairly small, so if friend's dad knocked on the door, we are fairly sure we would've heard it. He let us know when he was leaving his house, about 15 minutes from my house. She was completely ready when he got there, about 25 minutes later, the reason we weren't standing right by the door when he got there. My step brother (also 17) was home but he didn't hear a knock, only came out when he heard the front door open. He said he knocked, but we're not entirely sure he did. 

I can drive and I offer to come get Friend, my mom also offers to get her because he drives her all the time but he insists that he drives her. My parents don't get home until past 4pm, and he knows that if he wants her home earlier than that he has to get her, or again we would drop her off later on.

I talked to my mom about everything later after it happened and it made her realize that if my friend's dad is going to just walk into our house, then really anyone can. 

Our house lock works like I said, but it's slightly broken and difficult to lock, however everyone in the house should be more careful to lock the door. We are also getting new locks after this, which is great. 

My mom is worried that Friend's dad won't allow her to come over anymore but it sounds like he's already on the edge about that. He is only seeing from our perspective and thinks we're hiding something, and if my mom tells him it makes her uncomfortable then hopefully he'll see from her side. 

No matter what happens my friend turns 18 in June and we graduate this year, so it's not too much longer but it still would suck not being able to hang out at my house anymore.

1ijgom3,"AITA for telling my grandma not to sell an expensive setup for so cheap, even if it’s family?","Okay so i, 19m was speaking to my grandma recently when she mentioned she was selling her computer and the entire setup to my cousin. out of curiosity i asked how much she was selling it for and she said $150. i was confused because it was an expensive setup, the monitor alone was six hundred not counting the wireless keyboard and mouse and high quality microphone. i asked why she was selling it so cheap as it was still in beautiful condition and worked great. there’s no reason to sell for only 150 and she should look into how expensive the setup actually was and how much it’s worth. well she took my advice and is now selling it for 450. my cousin and other family members are angry with me because she should apparently sell it for so cheap because “he’s family”. personally i don’t think i did anything wrong and i feel i would be an awful grandson if i let my grandma get scammed like that. but apparently im “driven by greed”?

1iy8lil,WIBTA if I put a lock on my bedroom door so my GFs mother can’t sleep in our bed,"My girlfriend (F27) and I (M30) are going on holiday in a few months and her mother (F60s) and stepfather (M70s) have agreed to come and babysit our 2 cats (M1.5&F1.5). Her mother has said that they will need to use both the spare room bed and our own bed when they stay as they can’t share a queen sized spare bed for 1 week as they’ll “not be able to sleep in the same bed together all week” blaming the bed size. My GF has unhappily agreed to keep the peace but it’s making me very uncomfortable they’ll be using our bed. WIBTA if I put a lock on our bedroom door just before we go away so they can’t use it?

Extra info that may/may not be relevant: 
My girlfriend’s mother lives about 3 hours away visits every few months, but the step dad has never been before. Before we had the spare bed she would happily sleep on the quite comfortable sofa and we mainly got the spare bed for her visits. Although I know they are doing us a big favour by looking after the cats they were intending to use it as a mini holiday.
The mother does not always sleep in the same bed as her stepfather as they both wake each other up snoring and he is now getting some medical issues meaning he has frequent toilet trips in the middle of the night.",Guilty-Loquat-2153,1178,0.8700000047683716,443,1740524529,2025-02-25 17:02:09,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iy8lil/wibta_if_i_put_a_lock_on_my_bedroom_door_so_my/,2,2025
1iourgj,AITA for standing my ground with a crazy mother in law,"AITA for standing my ground with my MIL? 

My husband and I are expecting our first baby in June this year, it is the first grandchild on both sides of the family. My MIL was always a bit crazy prior to me getting pregnant but seems to have gone up a notch now. She has said things like ‘I can’t wait to tell people I’m going to be a mum again’, told someone I was pregnant and they doubted her so she reassured them by saying ‘no look at how fat she’s getting’ while I was standing beside them & made a complete song and a dance about how she needed to be the first person to buy our baby clothes and it’s going home from hospital outfit, the list goes on about how she’s amazing and no one will ever birth children like she did. What really tipped me over the edge recently was to do with our scan of the baby. For context we live in the Uk and you are provided 2 ultrasound scans, one at 12 weeks and another at 20 weeks they will usually print 3/4 pictures of the scan for you to take but this is ones they chose and your given what your given. When we went to visit I had shown the first 12 week scan and she demanded to keep it, I explained that as it’s a free scan with the NHS we only get a few and she can’t keep it as it is special to us, I did however take a photocopy of it to give to her. This is no longer good enough for the 20 week scan and she is now calling me and telling my husband he needs to bring her one of the scan photos as it’s her grandchild to. I am now fed up having to explain to my husband how this woman makes me feel horrible calling me fat and now demanding that she gets one of our scans that really means a lot to me. He doesn’t get it and ends up in a fight. AITAH for telling her that I do appreciate she is excited about my child but to back off and it’s our child not hers?

1iowi46,AITA for telling my fiancée to stop being a brat?,"My fiancée and mom are fighting because my fiancée wanted a wedding at this lake in the mountains that she talked about before the engagement. We visited every year and it’s almost tradition to hike up there and camp there and there is more hiking past that point that we make a long weekend of it. 

My mom is not happy because she is not fit enough for the hike. Her family is because they are a hikers but my mom has knee issues and is overweight and cannot do anything too difficult. This hike is 6 km to get to the lake and everyone in the wedding party can do it. My fiancée agreed but then wanted to do it in her aunt’s backyard. Her aunt has the nicest backyard out of the people we know but I wouldn’t say it’s still very nice. She said she was just going to buy some string lights and an arch and do it there. I have been to the backyard and it’s not bad it just has garden beds and chickens in the corner which my mom isn’t happy with. My mom wants a formal location and is arguing the backyard spot is her punishing her from her first option. My fiancée denies it and says it’s because she doesn’t want to pay for a ceremony spot and she thinks the backyard is prettiest spot that is free. We looked at some public parks but they get very crowded and renting them is already not an option as they mostly filled up.

My mom found a rental spot in a building with a decorative wall and benches that cost $1200 for 2h rental and is something she felt like is pretty enough for a wedding. This is the cheapest option other than the parks we come across. My fiancée refuses to pay for it even though she agreed to half and told my mom if she wants to dictate the spot she needs to pay for it. My mom is taking it as her punishing her for not letting the wedding happen at the lake. They are arguing and I think my fiancée and I each paying for half is an easy fix and she is making it difficult for no reason. She refuses to make any compromises and told my mom if she doesn’t want the wedding at her aunt’s backyard then she doesn’t have to come. We argued about it as well and I called her a brat because it’s her way or the high way and she called me an asshole. I don’t know why this is such a huge compromise to her but AITA?

1iwm13i,AITA for not cutting his hair? He isn’t talking to me at the moment,"Ever since the marriage of my parents, my mum used to cut my dad’s hair on a monthly basis. 
However, this arrangement changed several years ago when my mum sadly passed alway. 
Since my mum’s passing, things became odd. Dad will asking my brother in-law to cut his hair. He will offer my sister and my family a nice dinner to meet up as well which we were all fine with at first, but now both my sister and I have our own children to take care of, we have been pretty occupied with our family and no longer felt we have the time to cut his hair.

I recently took over the barber duty because I was away overseas for a few years. Being the son, I have been discussing with my brother in-law to convince my dad to find his own barber. So last week over the phone,  I tried in the politest way to ask if he can settle with a barber of his choice. But everything suddenly went wrong when he didn’t like my idea at all. He insisted that my brother in-law or I must cut his hair. He cut the phone call off before I had much to explain. And we haven’t spoke since that day.

Am I an asshole for getting into this situation?
My dad has been somewhat controlling being an Asian parent. But us family are fed up with his demand.

1ipofgi,AITA for not giving my sister credit for the tasks I get done around the house?,"Some Background: I (19F) live at home with my sister (20F) and mom (55F). At home we have 5 pets, our house is on the smaller size but it does have 3 floors.

My mom works 5 days a week. She spends most of her time on her days off, getting extra work done. My sister and I work 2 days a week, family rules dictate we can’t work more during the semester in order to prioritize our studies. The other five days, we both have classes. All of my classes are in person meanwhile all of my sister’s classes are online. I also have doctors appointments throughout the week each week.

•

My sister and I have equal responsibilities in the house. We must take care of the pets, clean what needs to be cleaned, etc. It’s basic stuff. The problem comes that I’m the only one that who gets the job done. When I get home from class (4 hours after my sister gets up), I have to turn off lights and open all the curtains.  Same with walking/feeding the animals, cleaning dishes, cleaning the other rooms in the house. I do it all every single day.

My sister has accepted that if she doesn’t do stuff, then I’ll just do it and I won’t say anything about it. The alternative is me not getting the stuff done then both of us get in trouble.

Today, our mom gave both of us the task of replacing the kitty litter. I spent the day studying and it completely slipped my mind. I fully admit that I did not do it. When she got home, she was frustrated with us for not having the job done. In a moment of irritation, I yelled and said “maybe if [sisters name] helped out for once, stuff could get done”. My mom asked me to explain what I meant, so I told her about having to do all the jobs by myself on top of all the stuff I had on my own. This of course got my sister in a lot of trouble.

I feel justified in not giving my sister credit because she really has not given any help. But my sister is calling me a jerk because I should have just let the lecture end by not mentioning her not helping. Instead she got chewed out, which didn’t help her mood since she was having a hard time with her boyfriend breaking up with her.

So I don’t know. Am I the asshole for not giving my sister credit for me getting tasks done around the house without her help?

(Before you ask: why don’t you move out? Financial reasons, with college expenses it’s too expensive to move into an apartment or dorm. The other reason for me personally is that I’m in a disability program that’s helping me get the skills I need to live on my own, I’m not ready to be independent yet.)",LlamaDawn-Throwaway,954,0.9599999785423279,51,1739576619,2025-02-14 17:43:39,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ipofgi/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_credit_for_the/,2,2025
1ifk4wo,AITA for telling my siblings about my sister stealing our inheritance before I confront my sister?,"Don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried to ask her many times about probate (which she refused to do with excuses there wouldn’t be enough money to recover to make probate worth it) and she’s also been asked multiple times about a specific inheritance my mother came into when my mother was actively dying. 
  When I discovered the circumstances and amount of the money left, it was obvious my sister (the executor, the POA and caretaker) hid this from us and that it would’ve been a life changing amount of money for each of the beneficiaries on my mother’s will, which states equal splits.
 We are going to confront her about this and give her the opportunity to fess up and make right to each sibling with the remaining amount and not even be penalized for what she’s spent, so long as she’s compliant and upfront. Honestly I just feel like an asshole wishing there was another way to handle it and fearing she will always resent me for outting this secret.

1ihswh4,AITA.    Am I the asshole for deleting my wife’s text that upset me?,"My wife has made it clear to me through our entire 10+ years together that she uses “yeah”, “yep”, and “lol” to show she’s basically giving the what the fuck ever reply to whatever she is responding to. She has stated this throughout the years. 
And I have asked her in the past multiple times to talk to me about what’s upsetting her instead of replying to me in her basically upset code words.
She refuses. It’s always those words by themselves. Me or someone else will text her full sentences and she’ll respond with only “lol”, “yep” or “yeah”.
She never uses them unless she is upset. It could be however long and she won’t use them for weeks, and then something will upset her and she will only use them to express she doesn’t care about what the person is saying and that she isn’t even caring enough to respond to it.

This has always upset me. A few months ago I started to just delete the one word text where she responds with those words so that I can just move on from them and not get upset by them. Because it genuinely upsets me when that’s the only reply I receive and that when I try to talk to her or ask what’s wrong I’m only given those in response.

She recently used my phone to look up a recipe she sent me in the past, and in doing so saw our text from my side, where I had removed the text with one word text. She is upset and says that I’m disrespecting her by removing them because they are still responses.
 Even if they aren’t replying whatsoever to what was said and even if they are dismissing what was said, not to mention you only use them when you don’t care to respond??
I said it doesn’t affect the conversations we have, it just keeps me from getting worked up because she uses them with no regard for how the other person feels. I just want to continue our conversations without seeing them because even if I ask about them she refuses to say anything.

1iyyk0f,AITA? Refuse to be on kitchen cleaning schedule at work.,"So I (34f) work in a pretty small office with maybe 10-12 full-time employees. It's a generally chill environment and I enjoy working there. But a recurring issue seems to be cleaning, to the point that one section of the offfice has to use a rotating cleaning assignment schedule to ensure certain areas are kept clean. I always cleaned up after myself, and the problem was one or two specific employees, but I didn't mind having an assigned day because I do use the space and supplies. 

However, or supervisor is threatening to do the same with the employee kitchen and said that she'd prefer if we figured it out ourselves before she has to step in. I point-blank but politely told her that I have no intention of participating in a cleaning rotation for the kitchen, as I only use it to heat up coffee a couple times a week and am not the cause of the messes she is referring to. She explained that she has no way to pinpoint who specifically is responsible for the issues, so she has to be fair and ask everyone to pitch in equally, to which I replied that I will not be cleaning up after other grown adults. If that means I don't get to use the kitchen, so be it. Supervisor is annoyed and said she'd have to think over what I said but she wishes I'd just do it to keep the peace. I told her, respectfully, that's not my job and what's to prevent people from just leaving their mess because it's technically not their cleaning day? 

I might be the a-hole because I may be making a big deal out of something that's just not worth it, and I don't want to refuse to do my part. I just don't think this is my part.
