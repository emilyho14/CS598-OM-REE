1ihwjem,CMV: Elon Musk's role in Trump's administration is the product of corruption,"Elon Musk donated at least $277 million to Trump's election campaign. Musk was then appointed to lead the ""Department of Government Efficiency."" His employees now enjoy high-level access to sensitive information in organizations like the treasury.

If Musk earned this high position through his qualifications, then the $277 million donation would be an improbable coincidence. The writing on the wall is very clear: Musk bought access to the executive branch from Trump.

In order to change my view, you would have to convince me that either the campaign donations are a coincidence, or that creating a new organization and then giving control of it to your biggest individual campaign donor is not corrupt.

1knazvt,"CMV: People who act like the US is a uniquely cruel, crime ridden and stupid place are participating in the same American essentialism as the people who act like the US is the center of the universe and that freedom and prosperity only exist there.","Since Trump was reelected, I’ve been seeing an increase in anti American sentiments both online and in person. While I understand why (it’s pretty tough to have a good reputation globally when Trump is your president), it’s starting to feel to me like just another flavor of American arrogance. The idea that America is the ultimate hero and that they are the ultimate villain comes from the same place. Blaming every global conflict, every global economic downturn, and every unfavorable cultural movement on the US is just reinforcing the idea that America is the center of the world, and that other countries don’t have their own agency and culture. 

I’ve seen people blame both the Israel/Palestine and Russia/Ukraine wars on the US (they’ve obviously played a part in these wars, but let’s not act like those countries don’t have their own agency and make their own decisions). I’ve seen people blame anti-blackness on the US (as if the US invented racism, and it doesn’t exist in every country on earth). I’ve seen people act like colonialism was an American invention, or that the concept of “stolen land” only applies to the US. I’ve seen people blame the rise of misogyny and antisemitism on the US. To me, this all comes from the same place as the people who say things like “America invented freedom”. 

My main point is that if you’re going to be somebody who gets frustrated when Americans act like they are earth’s saviors, you can’t then turn around and act like America is the driving force of all evil on earth. That is the same thing, just in reverse. The US is just another country, with people who are kind, cruel, smart, stupid, and everything in between, just like everywhere else on earth.

1gac58g,CMV: Censorship within /r/WorldNews is dangerous,"/r/WorldNews is the largest subreddit on reddit, and controlling the narrative with permabans for widely supported views is dangerous and promotes a one sided story. It creates a self perpetuating echo chamber. 

I was permabanned instantly for saying that Israel is enforcing an apartheid. Something many extensive United Nations reports have concluded, along with the top respected humanitarian aid organizations, and the government of the country for whom the word was literally invented, South Africa. 

Being instantly permabanned for just agreeing and sharing a view with these organizations undermines any credibility for the largest subreddit, yet they are the dominant voice for international news on reddit. 

Whether you agree that for example Israel is upholding an apartheid is not the issue, it is the complete lockdown on what is able to be discussed on that subreddit.

1drtg6g,CMV: The worst thing the DNC can do right now is nothing.,"The way I see it, there’s three scenarios, but only two are likely.

The first is what I consider the most likely, it’s the thought that inspired this post, and is by far the worst outcome for the DNC. They wait NC (get it?). Biden’s polling numbers don’t recover enough, and, as November approaches, they realize he isn’t going to win, panic, get Biden to step down, and announce a replacement. With a few weeks or a month or two to campaign, they aren’t able to shake Harris’ deep unpopularity and lose. Or,l they go with a different candidate, don’t get their name out enough because they’re short on time, and they lose.

The second is that they do nothing. It’s the second of the two scenarios that inspired this post. They pretend it didn’t happen, continue as before, and run Biden against Trump in a 2020 rematch. Biden, who wasn’t certain to beat Trump before, at the height of his unpopularity, runs amid his low rating, doubts about his mental ability, calls to step down from his own party, and (at least the perception of) a shaky economy and high prices. He loses.

The third, and the least likely, is the winning scenario. The DNC acts now gets Biden to step down, replaces him with a younger, more virile candidate, and all of trump’s doubtful supporters flock to the younger alternative. With the benefit of three months of vigorous campaigning, they take the win.

There is technically a fourth scenario. The fallout from the debate is minimal, Biden runs normally and defeats Trump. If this was likely, we wouldn’t be hearing calls for him to step aside from his own party and from major media outlets.",Separate_Draft4887,484,0.6600000262260437,1129,1719721951,2024-06-29 23:32:31,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1drtg6g/cmv_the_worst_thing_the_dnc_can_do_right_now_is/,6,2024,0.03325675527841593,0.2706983441324694,0.15197754970544267,cmv the worst thing the dnc can do right now is nothing,the way i see it there s three scenarios but only two are likely the first is what i consider the most likely it s the thought that inspired this post and is by far the worst outcome for the dnc they wait nc get it biden s polling numbers don t recover enough and as november approaches they realize he isn t going to win panic get biden to step down and announce a replacement with a few weeks or a month or two to campaign they aren t able to shake harris deep unpopularity and lose or l they go with a different candidate don t get their name out enough because they re short on time and they lose the second is that they do nothing it s the second of the two scenarios that inspired this post they pretend it didn t happen continue as before and run biden against trump in a 2020 rematch biden who wasn t certain to beat trump before at the height of his unpopularity runs amid his low rating doubts about his mental ability calls to step down from his own party and at least the perception of a shaky economy and high prices he loses the third and the least likely is the winning scenario the dnc acts now gets biden to step down replaces him with a younger more virile candidate and all of trump s doubtful supporters flock to the younger alternative with the benefit of three months of vigorous campaigning they take the win there is technically a fourth scenario the fallout from the debate is minimal biden runs normally and defeats trump if this was likely we wouldn t be hearing calls for him to step aside from his own party and from major media outlets,0,cmv the worst thing the dnc can do right now is nothing the way i see it there s three scenarios but only two are likely the first is what i consider the most likely it s the thought that inspired this post and is by far the worst outcome for the dnc they wait nc get it biden s polling numbers don t recover enough and as november approaches they realize he isn t going to win panic get biden to step down and announce a replacement with a few weeks or a month or two to campaign they aren t able to shake harris deep unpopularity and lose or l they go with a different candidate don t get their name out enough because they re short on time and they lose the second is that they do nothing it s the second of the two scenarios that inspired this post they pretend it didn t happen continue as before and run biden against trump in a 2020 rematch biden who wasn t certain to beat trump before at the height of his unpopularity runs amid his low rating doubts about his mental ability calls to step down from his own party and at least the perception of a shaky economy and high prices he loses the third and the least likely is the winning scenario the dnc acts now gets biden to step down replaces him with a younger more virile candidate and all of trump s doubtful supporters flock to the younger alternative with the benefit of three months of vigorous campaigning they take the win there is technically a fourth scenario the fallout from the debate is minimal biden runs normally and defeats trump if this was likely we wouldn t be hearing calls for him to step aside from his own party and from major media outlets
1bfeuhy,CMV: Some of the differences between men and women in gymnastics are outdated and should be changed,"While I understand that men vs women gymnastics are different sports that focus on different types of physicality, there are still differences that I think are outdated:

1. I think that all gymnasts should be given a much wider range of attire choices. Male gymnasts should be allowed to wear leotards/unitards, while female gymnasts should be allowed to wear pants/shorts. It's especially important for women because often female gymnasts in leotards are sexualised, or couldn't perform if they are on their periods.

2. Remove the need for music and dance elements for women's floor apparatus. I think it should be optional for both men and women to include music or dance elements. Some people enjoy the choreography element of gymnastics while others don't. I don't see how that's relevant to how good a gymnast is.

3. Men should have rhythmic gymnastics, like this [video here](https://youtu.be/EQ-sorX193g?si=TBp0TftKxo3CYqmQ). I think it'd be a great addition for men to showcase the more artistic side of gymnastics. The physicality focused and the apparatus used will likely be different, but that's okay as it suits the appeal of a different set of athletes.

4. I don't know if this is doable, but I think men and women should have the same number of apparatus, probably five. I don't know how appealing this is but I think it's an outdated notion that women can only use 4 apparatus while men can use 6.",WheatBerryPie,403,1.0,142,1710511849,2024-03-15 09:10:49,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bfeuhy/cmv_some_of_the_differences_between_men_and_women/,3,2024,0.024395580352259052,0.033837293016558675,0.029116436684408865,cmv some of the differences between men and women in gymnastics are outdated and should be changed,while i understand that men vs women gymnastics are different sports that focus on different types of physicality there are still differences that i think are outdated 1 i think that all gymnasts should be given a much wider range of attire choices male gymnasts should be allowed to wear leotards unitards while female gymnasts should be allowed to wear pants shorts it s especially important for women because often female gymnasts in leotards are sexualised or couldn t perform if they are on their periods 2 remove the need for music and dance elements for women s floor apparatus i think it should be optional for both men and women to include music or dance elements some people enjoy the choreography element of gymnastics while others don t i don t see how that s relevant to how good a gymnast is 3 men should have rhythmic gymnastics like this video here i think it d be a great addition for men to showcase the more artistic side of gymnastics the physicality focused and the apparatus used will likely be different but that s okay as it suits the appeal of a different set of athletes 4 i don t know if this is doable but i think men and women should have the same number of apparatus probably five i don t know how appealing this is but i think it s an outdated notion that women can only use 4 apparatus while men can use 6,0,cmv some of the differences between men and women in gymnastics are outdated and should be changed while i understand that men vs women gymnastics are different sports that focus on different types of physicality there are still differences that i think are outdated 1 i think that all gymnasts should be given a much wider range of attire choices male gymnasts should be allowed to wear leotards unitards while female gymnasts should be allowed to wear pants shorts it s especially important for women because often female gymnasts in leotards are sexualised or couldn t perform if they are on their periods 2 remove the need for music and dance elements for women s floor apparatus i think it should be optional for both men and women to include music or dance elements some people enjoy the choreography element of gymnastics while others don t i don t see how that s relevant to how good a gymnast is 3 men should have rhythmic gymnastics like this video here i think it d be a great addition for men to showcase the more artistic side of gymnastics the physicality focused and the apparatus used will likely be different but that s okay as it suits the appeal of a different set of athletes 4 i don t know if this is doable but i think men and women should have the same number of apparatus probably five i don t know how appealing this is but i think it s an outdated notion that women can only use 4 apparatus while men can use 6
1ddowi7,CMV: The Hunter Biden Case Has Virtually No Bearing on Biden's Suitability as President,"After reading the New York Times' reporting, there seems to be a  consensus among reporters that this verdict will weigh heavily  against President Biden. I'm sincerely confused as to why that would be the case though because: 

1. Hunter Biden is not running for President.
2. Hunter Biden is a 50-something year-old man who presumably made his own choices. It's not like this was the case of a minor where the parents are ultimately responsible for his behavior. 
3. Hunter Biden does not write the President's policies, domestic or international. His conviction has no bearing on how President Biden will govern, set policy, make his budget, etc.  
4. President Biden has been convicted of nothing, charged with nothing. 
5. Donald Trump is literally a convicted felon. Shouldn't being a felon be worse for a campaign than being related to a felon?

Given those reasons, why is the Hunter Biden case even an issue? Most Americans are related or know someone personally that has a drug problem, and people who are in the midst of their drug issues are generally not known to be the best law-abiding citizens.

1jw9j7h,CMV: DEI is just a buzzword used to cover racism,"**Being against Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion blatantly promotes Segregation, Inequality, and Prejudice. This country was founded upon and made great by immigrants**. It's horrible to see a large-scale attempted shift away from welcoming different cultures and it's ignorant to pretend that this country hasn't been shaped around institutional racism. **The melting pot has rusted.** 

The incredibly shallow thought process of: ""We should just have qualification-based hiring's"" is brain dead. We already hire off of merit, but are trying to give those who don't have an 'uncle in the business' a fighting chance. **Almost every high-paying professional work environment I've been in is 90%+ white.** To further this notion, labeling professionals/people who have worked hard to get where they are as 'DEI hires"" is horrible. 

**DEI is just a scape-goat for the Trump-alignment of his and his constituent's ideal white America.** The scrubbing of the Tuskegee Airmen and other Black/Hispanic/etc figures from government websites. The banning of books and reshaping of our school's education about slavery in America. The list goes on, all labeled as DEI. 

**Stiff-arming federal agencies, schools, and corporations with purposely vague notions of: 'Supporting DEI' to reshape/impose fear.** Meanwhile the threat of federal funds used as leverage. 

**America is on life support as the values that made this country great are torn to shreds**. Decades of collective action undone as our allies are spat on. 

Meanwhile women and those with disabilities fall under DEI.

16ia8w6,CMV: Changing Snow White's race is parallel to changing Black Panther's race,"A new remake of Snow White is currently being made and they've, controversially, changed Snow White’s race. I disagree with this; it comes off as virtue signalling. The character's race was changed to be more diverse, presumably.  
  
Now, I don't see what makes the change in Snow White's ethnicity any different to changing Black Panther to a different ethnicity or race. Snow White’s ethnicity and complexion are integral to her character, hence her name. One relatively 'big' part of the story is her complexion and how she is the ‘fairest of them all,’ and unique because of it. Similarly, Black Panther’s name originates from the Black Panther party and his race is relatively important compared to most characters. \`  
  
Even as a person who leans left (essentially centrist), there is the double standard that much of the left holds. The double standard is the opinion or view that changing a white person’s race is okay, or perhaps even great, but changing a black person’s race is racist and deemed whitewashing. I understand there is some nuance here but I still believe the two things are on a similar level. Whitewashing is bad because it pushes forward the message that being black is ‘bad’ or not desirable. Blackwashing should be seen as bad as it pushes forward the message that whiteness is not desirable. Perhaps the intention of blackwashing in media is to be diverse, but again, I find this to be virtue signalling and there are better ways to go about this… just make new characters or new movies.  
  
In my opinion, race should not be changed if it’s an original and old character, particularly if it’s relatively integral to the character’s identity. Just make new characters.  
  
I assume that I will get replies that point out that Snow White is not Disney’s story and there are many different versions, thus, it’s not necessarily race-swapping characters. But that’s wrong:  
  


>  
Snow White is a live-action remake of the Disney animation classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" which debuted in 1937. However, it appears that Disney is approaching the seven dwarf characters in a new way in order to avoid reiterating prejudices from the first animated feature. The lead actress Zegler also hinted at the story's contemporary revisions meant to appeal to the progressive audience during the D23 event.[\[1\]](https://collider.com/snow-white-disney-live-action-remake-release-date-cast-plot/)

  
  
The issue is that Disney and other massive corporations are making *\[x\]* and then advertising it as *\[y\]*. The only reason for this is because these corporations want a bigger audience so they grab nostalgic stories such as Snow White and other classics and then reboot them to get a guaranteed audience. For example, Velma, a TV series where they race-swapped Velma, is hardly the original character- neither are the rest of the characters, really. They marketed the series as Scooby-Doo characters to gain instant and free traction despite the fact they are hardly even the same characters.   
  
So yeah, that’s basically my view. I just don’t agree with the race-swapping of random characters and I think that race-swapping Black Panther is of the same nature as race-swapping Snow White.

1krvvrf,CMV: There is no realistic path to dismantling Israel as a Jewish state,"I rarely discuss Israel/Palestine. Made the mistake of trying to have a conversation in a thread full of people shouting 'Dismantle Israel' in a news sub and got permabanned. Feel free to check my comment history.

I understand it's a topic many people are passionate about, but so much of the 'discussion' is just screaming, with zero solutions that aren't just genocide. I am, sincerely, not seeing a realistic path forward where Israel is dismantled or radically reformed by outside forces. It's not like South Africa, where whites were a small minority ruling over a large majority of black people, and political and economic pressures were enough to eventually force a free election. It was a fragile, minority rule system to start with. But in Israel, right now, the population is ~75% Jewish. Even if we imagine adding the Palestinians of Gaza to the population, Jews will still be a majority. A free election in a combined Israel & Palestine would still look pretty close to what's already in place. Like what's the plan here? Because 'Two state solution' obviously is not what a lot of pro-Palestinian people have in mind. Not among protestors, and most definitely not on reddit. There is a very strong sentiment that Israel should just cease to be, rarely making any mention of what should happen to the people there.

You can't take the vote away from the Jews, because if you do, Hamas or something like it will win, and their *explicit* goals are to murder the entirety of the Jewish people in the region. Just look at the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund. The Gaza government loudly and openly paid the families of any muslim who murdered any Jew in Israel *for any reason*. Life in Gaza is abject misery right now, and half the population is *still* supporting the October 7th attacks. What exactly do people think will happen if the Palestinians are allowed to decide what happens to the Jews in Israel? That would just be an even bigger bloodbath than the current war.

So... what's the alternative? Expelling all the Jews? And send them where, exactly? Many of them are the children or grandchildren of Jews who were expelled from other Arab countries in the 20th century. You think sending them back to dictatorships that confiscated all their grandpa's property and kicked them out already is a good idea? No? Alright, you think we can find a country willing to take in 7 million Jews? No? Alright, should we forcibly split them up and guard to make sure they are only ever a small minority wherever they go? That hasn't worked out great, historically. Help me see a realistic solution here, people. I'm not condoning the actions of the IDF or the current Israeli government, but you have to be *for* something. You can't just shout ""From the River to the Sea"" and pretend 7 million Jews will just go away. Give me a sane, realistic path forward that doesn't devolve into a second holocaust.

1isgi09,CMV: Claims that Kamala should’ve “been more progressive” are out of touch with reality,"I'll be responding to a talking point  
  
**""Being more progressive would've energized her base"".** No. It would not have energized her base, it would have energized *you*. Progressives are not, and never have been, the base of the Democratic Party. Progressivism is something that was introduced to us 10 years ago by someone who wasn't even a democrat (Bernie), and both times (2016 & 2020) the voters said ***no***, decisively. (No, the 2016/2020 primaries were not ""rigged"", but I can debate that in the comments)  
  
In 2016 & 2020, Harris watched her, as well as other progressives (Bernie & Warren), get demolished in the primaries by more moderate figures. Now with that in mind, why would she try that strategy again? It's pretty simple lol. And even when Kamala proposed mildly progressive ideas ( eg child tax credit), she got hit with the ""why didn't you do this in the past 4 years""?

Nobody cares about paying +10% taxes for socialism when they can't even afford groceries.. Read the room.. The 2024 election was not the time or place for that. You can't expect her to become a clone of Bernie Sanders so she can pander to you...

1fz67ym,CMV: Haiti is not a failed state but a victim of colonization and revenge,"With the recent tragedies going on in Haiti due to gang violence and the assassination of the i president many people on this site have referred to the country as a failed nation and asked what could’ve happened to bring them to this state. I think this is an ignorant position that makes light of history.

Haiti was a slave nation where people who were stolen from Africa were traded and made to work under threat of violence rape castration lynching and murder. When they orchestrated one of the first major successful slave rebellion, pushing back the French, and allowing for the Louisiana purchase to occur they were not only not welcomed into the rest of the world but brutally punished and forced to pay back “reparations” to the French. 

The enslaved people of Haiti were forced to pay money to the people who killed, raped, and enslaved them and this debt was not paid off for 122 years. Under threat of warship they were told to pay back more than 10x the cost of the Louisiana purchase. The equivalent of 20-30 billion dollars.

Thomas jefferson worked to isolate Haiti diplomatically and strangle it economically, fearing that the success of Haiti would inspire slave revolts back home. Haitian success was perceived as a threat to slavery in America for decades, and the United States didn't officially recognize Haiti until 1862, as slavery began being abolished.

The United States  worked to isolate a newly independent Haiti during the early 19th century and violently occupied the island nation for 19 years in the early 20th century. While the U.S. officially left Haiti in 1934, it continued to control Haiti's public finances until 1947, siphoning away around 40% of Haiti's national income to service debt repayments to the U.S. and France.

This means that while other countries were taking advantage of the various and exponentially quick technological revolutions, Haiti was trying to pay its way out of a fictional and racist debt “owed” to slave holders at gunpoint. 

If you add on the effects of natural disasters and the earthquake as well as the fact their president was murdered by foreign mercenaries. It makes sense that they would be in this position, and they deserve empathy not the designation of a failed state.

1bnolej,CMV: Russia cannot win the war in Ukraine at this point.,"So by victory I mean achieving objectives, which we should consider at the start of the invasion, when the intention was to take Kyiv and install a puppet government, and to take much of Ukraine. 

But to expand on that, long term what could Russia's reduced goals be considered? A smaller area of Ukraine? Slowing the spread of NATO? ""de-nazification?""

I contend that in the long run none of these will happen in a way that Russia desires. To change my view on this you will need to convince me that Russia can achieve their military goals in Ukraine.

Don't come at me with Russia adjusting their goals and claiming victory, like ""well we didn't want Ukraine anyway, and our goal was to cause NATO to expand"", I am not buying that.

Here goes:

Russia on offense:

* Russian military doctrine is terrible at projecting power. Russia uses old soviet military doctrine, which is to defend the homeland on the cheap. More lower end tanks, more lower end artillery, more lower end aircraft, etc. Fewer support trucks per battalion, instead moving men, machine and supplies by rail inside Russia, And not going for air dominance but airspace denial. Using robust SAMs to deny airspace once the ground has taken.
* Russian logistics are worse than Russian military doctrine. This is the ability to provide reinforcements, ammunition, food, and other supplies to those fighting the war. Omar Bradley once said amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics, and he was correct. Keeping the war machine moving takes good logistics, and Russia is garbage at it.
* Russian maintenance practices are marred by corruption and inefficiency. Corruption has caused needed maintenance not to happen, or to be underfunded after theft of funding. And this has caused Russia to have more failures than expected in ordinance (at one point 60% of Russia's guided missiles failed to launch, target or detonate) or in equipment. (Russia has had a staggering failure rate on vehicles and aircraft. You have to do the wrench work, and Russia doesn't do it well.
* Russia's losses have been severe. Not just in human losses, having lost more soldiers to being killed or wounded, having lost perhaps 400,000 soldiers to being wounded or killed. (now more than the USA has lost in all wars going back to WW2, and now they are going into WW2 in terms of US losses) and Russia has endured. In terms of vehicles the losses are perhaps more damaging, as replacement is not as easy as another round of conscription, where we now see Russia sending T54/55 tanks into Ukraine, tanks built in 1948. Russian losses so far, per Oryx, who verifies losses via images or video:

2856 tanks  
  
1273 armored fighting vehicles  
  
3677 infantry fighting vehicles  
  
418 armored personnel carriers  
  
3175 trucks  
  
353 towed artillery   
  
706 self propelled artillery  
  
361 multiple rocket launchers  
  
106 aircraft  
  
135 helicopters  
  
21 naval ships and submarines

That is a large amount off loss for Russia, a country not able to replace their losses.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\_of\_the\_Russo-Ukrainian\_War

So militarily, Russia cannot project power well, and has gone about as far as they are going to go in terms of offensive actions. Russia will struggle to go any farther, and the harder they push the worse the losses will be. Will they run out of soldiers? No, but they will run out of equipment for those soldiers. As much as it was a shock to see two US sourced Bradley's kill a modern Russian T-90, a Russian T62 or T54/55 has no place on a modern battlefield, they will not last long in combat.

So that is the ability for Russia to go on offense, now let's talk Russia on defense:

* Russian defensive ability is better than their offensive ability, and it isn't close. Now their artillery and their mines have much more value, and the S400 and S500 systems are quite good, and they can deny the airspace near the front to non-stealthy Ukrainian aircraft.

If Ukraine attacks these defenses, Ukraine will take much larger losses than when defending against Russian offenses. They can and should keep fighting, but carefully, as to prevent as many losses as possible.

But in the long run, the Russian defensive ability wont save them. First, Russia hasn't achieved their goals, right now if it all ended Russia didn't achieve their goals and lost a staggering amount, right now it would be a loss if Russia didn't go back on offense...and if they did it would be a terrible idea for them.

Why wont Russian defensive capability save them? Let's talk some reality. First, if Ukraine can destroy the Kerch Strait bridge, they probably take Crimea through siege. Russia feeds and arms their forces in Crimea using that bridge, and without it their ability to continue that (bearing in mind poor Russian logistics) are compromised. Sending those supplies across the water cannot possible support their forces there and can also be targeted, and sending them through contested Ukraine is quite a lot farther and more costly, and is also in danger in the parts of Ukraine it would have to drive through.

That is Crimea eventually falling. It is a matter of when, not if.

Now the parts of Ukraine with a direct land connection to Russia? That is much more problematic. For Ukraine to take that would take military capability Ukraine, but in the end if those areas are returned to Ukraine (and again, keeping those areas is not a victory for Russia, I am speculating in what a full victory for Ukraine would look like) it will not be because they were lost militarily.

Why? Let's talk sanctions:

The sanctions are doing more than you might think. Russia is hurting. Russia is buying artillery shells from North Korea and drones from Iran, nations Russia used to supply, now they are a customer. That speaks to Russia's military industry. Russia cannot build Armada tanks to send into war, they are sending T54/55s built in 1948. And Russia cannot build more SU-57's, an aircraft not seen over Ukraine. 

Russia is mainly selling gas and oil to China and India, and they are selling it for currency that only buys goods and services from China and India. That will not help them to win the war. 

So as long as the sanctions continue, Russia's clock is ticking. They can put off the inevitable, but in the end Russia will have to abandon this war that they started. Economics demand it.

Will the sanctions end? No, not until the war ends, and not for a while after that. So the west will keep the sanctions up for as long as it takes, as that serves the interests of the west. 

Will the military aid end? No. It will slow, but we are still talking about spares, older weapons systems and ammunition which is not front of the line for NATO. This is an investment for the west into Russian defeat, and the harder Russia loses, the more secure the west is when this war is over. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, lets talk about the reality of the situation for Russia:

Russia is sending T54/55s into war, Ukraine is now sending Abrams, Leopards and Challengers. Russia cannot take steps forward, their ability to project power is a joke. Russia is getting hit at home by Ukraine, and now by terrorists. And now NATO has expanded, now closer to Russia than ever, now covering both sides of the exit from St. Petersburg, making getting submarines out in a stealthy way more difficult for Russia. And in the end Ukraine has kept fighting, and the west has kept supporting them.

Russia has succeeded to the greatest extent that they are able to militarily and economically, and can go no further, and cannot be said to have won this war.   


And the future is more bleak for Russia than the present.

1er6clk,CMV: The USA are a Plutocracy (a form of Oligarchy),"To demonstrate my point, I will start first by underlining the undemocratic nature of the US. 

First of all, in any democracy as it is defined each person’s vote must be equal to any other.
This is false for the US for several reasons:

## a) The electoral college system: 

39.5 million Californians translate to 55 electoral votes, while a combined total of 20 other states with the same population translate to 102 electoral votes. 

As it is clear, the vote of a Californian person has less intrinsic value than that of any other state in those 20. 

Furthermore, if say Republicans win in a certain state even by just 51%, they get ALL the electoral votes, meaning the other 49% amounts to a grand total of 0 political power. This is entirely and irrefutably undemocratic.

## b) The two party system:

This system, by itself, is undemocratic.

In an ideal democracy, all citizen with democratic beliefs should be represented. 

While this tends to be false even for multi-party systems, in those systems the large majority of people is represented in their ideas by a combination of parties: someone who is conservative in terms of immigration but progressive in terms of climate change might not be represented entirely by a single party but their beliefs are in fact represented. 

This of course doesn’t happen in the US. 

There’s no representation for socialized healthcare.

No representation for a ban on weapon carrying with. 

No representation for an electoral system change or for a constitutional revision.

And I could go on.

## c) The nationalistic zeal: 

USA are nationalistic. I think we can all agree with that. What that translates to, is a significant trend of passing the blame to outside forces, alongside the rivaling party. This is particularly in the case Donald Trump’s way of politics.

“The economy isn’t working? It’s because our allies are trading with china (and it’s the other party’s fault)”
 
“Covid struck too hard? It’s because of our border policies (and it’s the other party’s fault”

“We lost the election? Well Russia must have had something to do with it, with the other party’s approval” 

What this really means for a democratic society is the lack of self criticism and self improvement, at least at the federal level. Despite all the debates online and in court about what party supports what policies, the actual reality is much more “conservative” in regards to changes and reforms.

Regardless of who wins, it’s unlikely that truly deep reforms will get passed. However this is only a recent trend, and only true in terms of domestic policies. The true changes will be seen in terms of international politics, but that’s off topic for this discussion.

## d) Money talks:

Lobbying is legal in the US. Let that sink in. 

In terms of domestic policies (although this reflects in international policies as well), politicians are very much encouraged to accept financial support from national and multi-national level corporations, in exchange for support.

What this means is: you are not getting what you voted for. 

The Military industrial complex will still receive support.

Pharmaceutical companies will still be allowed astronomical prices for otherwise cheap medications.

X, Meta, Google and other tech companies will still be able to sell illegally retrieved customer data.

No. Matter. Who. You. Vote.

So, to recap, the USA are

1) a democracy only in name
2) nationalistic and stagnant
3) sheltering powerful companies

There’s a name for a form of government with those characteristic a *Plutocracy*.

1agdy9r,CMV: Humans are inherently cooperative and egalitarian versus the violent and selfish brutes that modern civilization has made us out to be.,"Buckle up - this is going to be a long one.

I know this might seem counterintuitive to what is being observed in modern day societies. We have murder, rape, wars, genocide, slavery, hate crimes, and large disparities between classes of people. There’s so many examples of people hoarding resources from needy underserved populations. There’s many examples of corporate greed in which they know they’re poisoning the world (see: forever chemicals such as PFO/PFAs pushed by companies like DuPont and 3M that’s now in everyone - and I do mean everyone’s - blood streams) but fail to act because it would hurt their shareholders bottom line. 

Personally, I am a professional ecologist who works in the private sector in America and knows first hand how governments write and re-write laws to help bolster business profits at the expense of the environment. I am not naive to the throes of how every major system (social/racial/environmental) is basically fucked and in need of a major upheaval to get things back on track - if they were ever on track in the first place.

All of this can be chalked up to greed of the few at the expense of the many. This greed seems to trickle down to the everyday person because if you’re not looking out for number one you’ll get left behind in the poisonous dust, polluted air, and contaminated drinking water. You’ll be poor, uneducated, and forever stuck in the cycle of being exploited for what little you do have by those who want it all.

However, I am currently in the process of writing a book about how f*cked humans are, how we got here, and what we can do about it. Through my interdisciplinary research I have discovered surprising theories contrary to what is obviously happening to us all. Which has changed my pessimistic POV of what being human really means.

Richard Dawkins might be the proponent of the trickle up theory of how our genes are selfish which equates to us as humans being selfish but I have come to the conclusion that he is ultimately short sighted in his argument.

To begin let’s get some dates straight - humans (Homo sapien sapien) first appeared 200,000 years ago. The beginning of modern civilization was only birthed 10,000 years ago with advent of agriculture (the Neolithic Revolution) which changed the way humans lived from migratory hunter-gathering to a more sedentary lifestyle. The sedentary life style that agriculture required is what has done us in, not our biology.

We are taught that our selfish brutish behaviors are inherent to our biology because if we just look to our closest ancestors - the chimpanzee - we will see that they too are violent creatures that live in cyclical harmony but are fraught with war, infanticide, resource hoarding, and rape. We share 98% of our DNA with them, so this must be true. But what is frequently over looked is that the chimpanzee is not our only closest relative there are also the bonobos. 

Bonobos also share 98% of our DNA and they are free of war, rape, infanticide, and resource hoarding. They’re cooperative, have sex for pleasure and conflict resolution, and are matriarchal. Historically, pre-agriculture, we share more with bonobos than we ever did with chimpanzees. In our natural environment which we evolved for, not the current one we are living in, we share more with bonobos than we ever did with chimpanzees.

Anthropological and archaeological investigations into hunter and gatherer tribes of the modern day show that the predominant themes between them are that they are egalitarian, cooperative, friendly, and easy going. This can be extrapolated to pre-modern humans due to the fact that these tribes, as seen in aboriginals or the Inuits to name two, have lived a traditional lifestyle up until very recently. 

Hunter-gathering tribes consisted of up to approximately 150 individuals. Which means that everyone knows everyone which then equates to social accountability. These tribes, while there are always exceptions to the norm, shared resources and didn’t praise anyone above anyone else as everyone was doing their part in supporting the tribe. Those who might have been too aggressive, attempted to resource hoard, or were disruptive in any way were ostracized, isolated, or even killed when other means didn’t work so that social cohesion was maintained.

Agriculture, on the other hand, ballooned populations due to increase fertility of women (not really a good thing) to levels where no one could know everyone which led to decrease accountability. Agriculture invented property, first with land and water, and then people were seen as resources by those who needed more workers to plow their fields. Agriculture birthed the patriarchy and made women and children into property. Agriculture created classes of the have and have nots and that led to disparity. Agriculture invented slavery as “civilized” societies captured and drug in hunter and gathering societies by their feet into their communities for cheap labor. Agriculture caused those in power to hoard resources from the greater collective. Agriculture led to wars between societies looking for more resources. Agriculture is the root of zoonotic (influenza, SARs, chickenpox etc) diseases to spread through our species. Agriculture led to famines as climate patterns changed. Agriculture led to the balloon of mental health problems. Agriculture is what destroyed our egalitarian ways.

We lived for approximately 190,000 years as hunter gathers amongst our family and kin. We lived in an environment which we were evolved for and we as a species were better for it. As Darwin points out, altruism and cooperation was naturally selected for because it was better for the species and as social animals because protecting our communities was as important as important as protecting oneself.

So, no we aren’t inherently selfish like Dawkins tries to claim nor are we naturally violent as our chimpanzee cousins. These are both symptoms of a sickness caused by living in an unnatural system. Just as birds who are kept confined that pluck out all their feathers, we are losing our minds and what it means to be truly human because of modern society - something we are not evolved for.

TL;DR humans are not naturally violent and selfish as modern day evidence has led us to believe. We lived as egalitarian altruistic communities for 190,000 years before the invention of agriculture. Agriculture and the sedentary life style that it required is what has caused us to become who we are today and is not a true reflection of the human species.",notmepleaseokay,348,0.7699999809265137,247,1706802279,2024-02-01

1enf4mh,CMV: Kamala's shutdown of hecklers at her Detroit rally can't reasonably be interpreted as a stance on Palestine,"The timeline as I understand it: 

* Kamala met with the protest group and talked to them prior to the speech.
* The protesters get rowdy and disruptive during the speech and Kamala reminds them that, while they have a voice, it's her time to speak.
* They persist and she shuts them down more harshly
* People who didn't think it through, didn't know the context, or just don't care make a big deal out of it and try to shame her and everyone else as being ""pro genocide"" as if those were related.

So basically, I want to know what possible perspective or information I missed that makes this wrong. There certainly seem to be a lot of people (bots?) who are just going nuts over this issue turning all their frustration and hostility about the middle east against Kamala and anyone who points out that this was about interruptions, not anything else.

What would change my view - information that changes the context of what happened, some other reasoning that what she said could reasonably be interpreted the way some people are taking it.

1ihdctq,CMV: Islam's Prophet muhammad was a horrible and disgusting person,"I'm an ex Muslim, and one of the biggest reasons I left islam had to do with all the disgusting things that Muhammad said and did throughout his life. 

Muslim apologists and dawah people love to portray him as an amazing human being, someone who was a flawless and timeless example for all of mankind, and if you're not that knowledge it's easy to be deceived into believing such things. As a muslim when I would hear about some of the more disturbing things he did from critics I would just brush it off as either inauthentic or taken out of context. 

As I became more religious and started studying more, I came across things he did and said that either didn't make any sense or were just straight up disgusting. Some of those things include: Marrying a literal child, forbidded eating with the left hand, commanding the execution of apostates, had several sex slaves, said that women who pluck their eyebrows are cursed, married up to 9 wives at one time even though the quran permits men to marry no more than 4, said that black dogs are devils, said women who wear perfume are like adulterous whores, said that men who wear trousers over their ankles will go to hell, forbidded music and other types of art, and so much other horrible and ridiculous shit.

1cm7v5h,CMV: There is no valid aviation-safety-related reason for airplane mode in modern airliners,"Airplane mode makes little difference to the navigation or communication capabilities of a modern airliner. First, the bands that a mobile phone tranmit on (800MHz upwards) do not overlap with the coms radio of airliners (100-300MHz for VHF and lower for HF). Second, they largely do not tranmit on the same bands as what’s used for navigation either, and either way ground based navaids are going the way of the dodo, and what’s left that’s commonly used is only ILS systems. One could argue that they may interfere with GPS since they both use GPS, but that’s neither here nor there or else GPS would break down in a slightly more crowded area.  

The simplest way to explain my point would be, if having mobile phones off airplane mode is so dangerous, then terrorists wouldn’t need to go to the trouble of bringing a bomb or some such, they merely need to turn on their $200 phone and that would be enough.  

Finally, to clarify, I am narrowing the scope of this to aviation safety related reasons. I don’t care if your phones might impact cell towers which might just happen to make an emergency call be delayed. And I don’t care if it’s because the law tells you to.  

I’d like to see anyone who can change my view by presenting evidence to support the opposite position.

1amad3o,"CMV: We can throw billions of dollars at public schools all we want, but until parents care more about their children’s academic performance nothing will change","We can’t spend our way out of it. We’ve tried. Look at the NYC public school system. We’ve shoveled dump trucks worth of money into their pockets and, while seeing some *marginal* improvements among some elements of the student body, have gotten nothing for it beyond more debt. America can’t wipe our asses for us, it’s not our mommy/daddy and we need to take responsibility for our lives and the lives of our children. And that means buckling down and making sure your kid is studying, doing their homework, **going to class** and in general giving two shits about their academic performance. No amount of money from the nanny state can fix that. Unfortunately, this problem is so deep and widely rooted I don’t know how the government *can* fix it.

In addition, the racial climate in America right now is just not conducive to discussions on a child’s poor performance. 69% of urban public schoolteachers in the United States are white. Using the New York state example, [https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/12/10/americas-public-school-teachers-are-far-less-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-than-their-students/ft_21-11-17_studentteacherrace_3/] (black and latino students are more then 40% more likely to have a white public-school teacher then one more congruent to their skin color (though how this takes into effect mixed race schoolteachers and mixed-race students I have no clue.). To be clear, I’d rather slam my hand in a door then get between *any* parent and their child. But it gets even harder when you’re a blonde, white woman telling a black parent/parents “hey x kid is a real shithead in class and doesn’t work hard, study, or in general attend.” without immediately losing the parents or at the very least, raising severely their hackles.

Parents are already extremely defensive about their children and then if you add the ugly history of race relations in America on top of it? Not a conducive environment for early interventions in troubled students lives. It’s the sad truth but you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. If the kid don’t care about reading, writing, or education in general you can’t force them to care. It has to come from the parent or guardian.

1bjjd5t,"CMV: jobs requiring constant physical labour deserve to be paid a lot than they currently are. Especially when comparing to the pay of other jobs, that don’t require physical labour, like a desk job. ","I don’t understand how people breaking their backs everyday, putting their bodies through hell, can get paid minimum wage. The future impact this sort of work has on your body after decades of wear and tear is astonishing. 

The medical bills and terminal pain that physical labourers experience in their old age is NOT worth getting paid minimum in their youth. Minimum wage is not worth the cost of the medical bills they will be experiencing in the future.

I have the opinion that people working on the loading dock and busting their butts deserve to be compensated the same as someone like a banker, a lawyer, or even a neurosceintist. It’s not fair that physical labourers get paid insanely less, but then also have to deal with expensive medical bills in the future. I can see why Lenin or Karl Marx had the opinions they had, it’s because their way of thinking is a lot more fair for **EVERYONE** . I can imagine people being against a communist system if they were born into privledge, and don’t want to share their wealth.

I happen to work at a loading dock for Walmart and this job is nothing like I expected. When you receive a job offer from the #1 company on the Fortune 500 list, you expect the job to be at least decently cushy, and to compensate well. That’s not the case. My co-workers recently informed me that we make the absolute bare-minimum income that they can legally pay us in this province. It’s a living heck hole in that loading dock area and most of my co-workers are at the bottom of society, barely scraping together a living. Tell me how the CEO can make millions of dollars while we’re working harder than him?! How does that make sense. This isn’t happening just with Walmart too, this is many billion dollar companies around the world.

I want to abolish the far-right economic system we have right now, and I want to bring in more aspects of communism. That doesn’t mean I want to be full communist but I do want workers to be compensated like it is a communist society. There is no way that you can tell me a banker works harder than I do, when I’m sweating my balls off carrying 50-100 lb boxes, **MY ENTIRE 6 HOUR SHIFT** . Professional athletes get paid millions for training everyday and there’s an argument that me and my co-workers are arguably putting our bodies through much much worse, but get compensated so much less. 

Lebron James makes $45 million a year. He plays roughly 100 games in a season (including playoffs), and each game is 48 minutes. 100 x 48 = 4800 minutes. 45 million / 4800min = $9374/minute.

$9375 x 60 min = $562,500/hour

That’s how much Lebron gets paid. Now let’s calculate how much I get paid per hour compared to him, and why don’t you capitalistic, fantastical economic ‘geniuses’ explain how that’s fair. Spoiler alert, #ITS NOT . But I digress. 

$15/562,500 x 100 = 0.00266%

**Let me say that again for the neoconservatists in the back** . My salary is 0.00266% of Lebrons. And all he does is throw a rubber ball through a metal ring… it’s complete bush league.

I’d like someone to argue against the fact that physical labour jobs need a LOT more compensation, and that a communist economic system is a lot more fair than a ‘free market’ one. I’m not saying we should be getting paid the exact same as Lebron James or a neuroscientist but it shouldn’t be anywhere near what it is now, and it frankly shouldn’t be anything past double our salary. Because there is no argument for them working double as hard as me, when I’m working as hard as I possibly can every day. I work so hard that I have been taking adhd pills from my coworkers every shift just to get through it. 

P.S. it’s funny that they call it a ‘free market economic system’ when I’m literally a slave to the system, sacrificing my youth and body for chump change. Us physical labourers are anything but free.

15s891q,"CMV: The conservatives who complain ""Why are we sending money to Ukraine instead of helping people here at home in America?"" wouldn't want that money to be spent on people in America, either.","Since the beginning of the war, a certain Trumpish faction of Republicans has been arguing that we shouldn't spend money on helping Ukraine ""because of the domestic needs at home.""

The first problem with this is that the amount of money the U.S. has sent to Ukraine is actually only a tiny percentage of GDP/federal budget, and it's for a good cause.

But the second, more pressing, problem is that even if the U.S. never sent any aid to Ukraine, and instead diverted the $70 billion in weaponry and financial aid back to America instead..........most of these Trump-wing conservatives wouldn't want that money spent on Americans either, despite their complaint. I'm talking about the Marjorie-Taylor-Greene type.

If it were spent on school lunches........Republicans have been spending a lot of effort blocking free school lunches.

If it were spent on welfare.......Republicans would complain that that's......well, welfare.

If it were spent helping the homeless...........Republicans would complain that it's helping 'stinky, dirty, lazy homeless people.'

In other words, Republicans don't actually **want** that money spent on helping people, they just want something to complain about.

Lastly, if the Biden administration indeed sent no aid to Ukraine, you can 100% guarantee that these Trump-wing Republicans would do a 180-degree and attack Biden for being ""weak,"" an ""appeaser,"" and claiming that Biden is letting Russia win.",SteadfastEnd,671,0.8199999928474426,626,1692140979,2023-08-15 18:09:39,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15s891q/cmv_the_conservatives_who_complain_why_are_we/,8,2023,0.05371403566349415,0.1499880009599232,0.10185101831170867,cmv the conservatives who complain why are we sending money to ukraine instead of helping people here at home in america wouldn t want that money to be spent on people in america either,since the beginning of the war a certain trumpish faction of republicans has been arguing that we shouldn t spend money on helping ukraine because of the domestic needs at home the first problem with this is that the amount of money the u s has sent to ukraine is actually only a tiny percentage of gdp federal budget and it s for a good cause but the second more pressing problem is that even if the u s never sent any aid to ukraine and instead diverted the 70 billion in weaponry and financial aid back to america instead most of these trump wing conservatives wouldn t want that money spent on americans either despite their complaint i m talking about the marjorie taylor greene type if it were spent on school lunches republicans have been spending a lot of effort blocking free school lunches if it were spent on welfare republicans would complain that that s well welfare if it were spent helping the homeless republicans would complain that it s helping stinky dirty lazy homeless people in other words republicans don t actually want that money spent on helping people they just want something to complain about lastly if the biden administration indeed sent no aid to ukraine you can 100 guarantee that these trump wing republicans would do a 180 degree and attack biden for being weak an appeaser and claiming that biden is letting russia win,1,cmv the conservatives who complain why are we sending money to ukraine instead of helping people here at home in america wouldn t want that money to be spent on people in america either since the beginning of the war a certain trumpish faction of republicans has been arguing that we shouldn t spend money on helping ukraine because of the domestic needs at home the first problem with this is that the amount of money the u s has sent to ukraine is actually only a tiny percentage of gdp federal budget and it s for a good cause but the second more pressing problem is that even if the u s never sent any aid to ukraine and instead diverted the 70 billion in weaponry and financial aid back to america instead most of these trump wing conservatives wouldn t want that money spent on americans either despite their complaint i m talking about the marjorie taylor greene type if it were spent on school lunches republicans have been spending a lot of effort blocking free school lunches if it were spent on welfare republicans would complain that that s well welfare if it were spent helping the homeless republicans would complain that it s helping stinky dirty lazy homeless people in other words republicans don t actually want that money spent on helping people they just want something to complain about lastly if the biden administration indeed sent no aid to ukraine you can 100 guarantee that these trump wing republicans would do a 180 degree and attack biden for being weak an appeaser and claiming that biden is letting russia win
19a7yjm,CMV: voters can and should be blamed for the horrible policies they enact by voting for certain parties politicians and policies,"I know this post will be controversial but I've been thinking about it for some time. There seems to be a disconnect over how politicians and law and regulation is overall started in the United states. Many people will give a pass to a person who voted for a politican who enacts a bad policy for their state country or city. It all starts origin wise with a vote by the people for a person or proposition to enact a law. 

For example the people in states like Texas and Idaho and other states with complete abortion bans (even the life of the mother is really just on paper) if you are a conservative person who has been voting republican your whole life and saw the extremist pro forced birth laws creep in your state year after year you can't be surprised by your state now post dobbs going full abortion ban. Many will say it's counter productive to do this as it could drive people away from changing their beliefs and voting for another person party or policy. But I believe that confronting someone with that fact that these polices that are enacted are in fact started by a vote. Many people feel that their votes are not causes for bad policy and can divorce their responsibility for their vote for harmful policy. Many ""left wing"" Podcasters claimed this about blaming Trump voters in 2016 by saying you couldn't blame them for voting for him.

Over the past year, I’ve watched funding get slashed so badly that some agencies had to shut down. Now I’ve got clients wondering how they’ll pay rent or medical bills, and even some elderly folks debating if they’ll have to go back to work just to survive.

Whenever I bring this up with friends, they instantly defend Trump. They’ll say I’m lying because Fox News or Trump himself claims the only people affected are “illegals” or people abusing the system. Even my own family has told me to *leave the country* for not supporting him.

1ib2o29,CMV: Donald Trump is playing everyone,"I’ve been following him from afar for a while trying to get my head around the whole phenomenon and understand it.

Essentially it’s ‘fear’, he’s inciting people’s basic instincts talking about various boogeymen, immigrants, weak leaders, real fears that people have and mainly to amplify those in his base to distract them from his real motives (picking their pockets)

But it’s actually not his nature, he’s only scared of being laughed at. He’s not actually scared of immigrants or DEI hires or trans people himself.  He’s a rich well socialised guy who just basically wants to feel important and grab money.

He is using his tough guy image as a negotiating tactic to try and throw weight around, and it’s working as people are actually believing he’s crazy and destructive, and he will even do things until people complain.

He’s not sure how to actually do anything so he’s just saying a lot and listening to what latches on in people and what they say, just spitballing.

1e5q70i,"CMV: Jack Black handled Kyle Gass' comment appropriately and it's silly to call anything regarding the events ""cancel culture"".","Quick context for anyone unaware: Tenacious D is the satirical duo of Jack Black and Kyle Gass.  Black is the more prominent of the members.  A few days ago, during a ""make a wish"" segment at a concert, Gass said his wish was something to the effect of ""that the shooter doesn't miss next time"".

Black went on to cancel the rest of the tour, also stating that future creative plans are now on hold.  Gass issued an apology - not a ""sorry if you were offended"" type, but an outright ""what I said was wrong"" kind.  He knew what he said was inexcusable.  

I do not understand peoples' reaction to this.

*""Oh, so now they're holding satirical comedians to a higher standard that political candidates!""*  Huh?  Who's ""they""?  Black is an outspoken liberal, so he's never been supportive of Trump and similar people.  He's holding his bandmate to the same standards he's held others to, including politicians.  

*""This must be that cancel culture that Republicans 'don't believe in'!""*  Again, huh?  Jack Black himself is the one who pulled the plug.  The promoter didn't cancel the tour.  The venues weren't canceling shows.  The leader of the freaking band made the decision.  

*""What a way to treat your friend.""*  Still confused here.  Ever since 2016, people on my side of the political spectrum (left-leaning) have been quite vocal about the notion that you can, and should, disavow your own freaking family if they say outrageously toxic things.  These people are now the ones saying that Black should just laugh off an utterly inappropriate comment about the nearly successful assassination of a former president / current candidate?

1g01fdk,CMV: Conspiracy theories are just coping mechanisms for life’s unpredictability.,"With Hurricane Milton making landfall in Florida, there are countless people who believe the government has the ability to generate a Category 5 hurricane with minimal effort. Cloud seeding, chemtrails, and other theories come up frequently. But at the core, these theories are about people being afraid of things they can’t control.

A lot of them advocate for ‘waking up’ and seeing the truth. They have to be constantly vigilant, as if there’s some kind of unseen enemy out to get everyone. The idea that things just happen randomly, without anyone being at fault, is impossible for them to accept.

It’s hard for them to face the fact that we can’t control nature, other people, or the forces of the universe.

1jsox9n,CMV: America has no way to remove Trump due to its ridiculously entrenched laws for the preservation of the presidency.,"All the protests, discontents, negative poll numbers, and even a majority republican dissent will NOT be able to remove Trump from office. 

They have tried to impeach Trump twice, and it did not work. 

If impeaching Trump for actual CRIMES did not work, then the constitution has NOTHING else to enable the removal of a US president. 

He would literally have to kill an innocent person on video to be successfully removed from office. 

Incompetence, greed, selfishness, gross negligence, ignorance, egomaniacal, general scumminess, ruining the economy and foreign relation, even actual fascism will NOT be enough to remove Trump, because American laws for removing the president is so weak that nothing sort of an actual horrible crime (murder, rape, treason) can lead to a successful prosecution and removal. 

A ""No confidence"" vote is not a thing for the American presidency. 

""But sir, surely actual fascism is enough to remove the President, right?"" -- I don't think so, because by then it would be too damn late and all the laws will be changed to keep him in power, Nazi style. 

It's relatively easy to vote someone into the presidency but ridiculously hard to remove them before their end of term. 

Trump could literally turn America upside down and inside out, dragging the world down with America and STILL remain in office. 

If any American constitutional/law/presidency experts could change my view on this, please enlighten me. I would LOVE to be proven wrong because this is becoming absolutely ridiculous.

1msci03,CMV: Putting low price limits on death row inmates' last meals defeats the point of offering one.,"So when someone is scheduled to be executed, they're usually given a last meal consisting of whatever they request. Unsurprisingly, this is often things like seafood, steak, or other expensive meals. 

I'm largely talking about the US here (I don't know other countries' death penalty laws/traditions), but several states have imposed restrictions on this last meal, with some states doing away with it completely, and some imposing limits as low as $20-$25. 

Practically, I understand the reason for imposing some restrictions, (such as food that can be purchased locally and reasonable substitutions if the specific food the inmate requested isn't available, or even a significantly higher price limit) but if you're going to offer someone the kindness of a last meal, limiting them to such an incredibly low price means that there's a high chance they won't be able to get what they want. You can barely order a meal from a fast food place that comes to less than $20, much less a real meal. (Especially if you live in a place with sales tax.)

1hc2wam,"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Biden’s legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure. ","Biden will be a historian’s president, loved in between the pages of a book but forgotten and disdained by your average Americans. I voted for Biden in 20 and Harris in 24’ but his presidency will be haunted by the shadow of defeat by trump. There’s no way around it. If you run an incumbent out of office saying “we’re better than this guy!” and then that same guy turns around and runs *you* out of office with overwhelming disapproval by the American public, you lost the battle and the war. 

Nobody cares about his achievements in foreign policy because America is making a turn toward isolationism again — as it’s done throughout its history at various times — nobody cars about build back better or the inflation reduction act. He will be seen as a Jimmy Carter-like figure, impotently standing on the sidelines as a former actor/celebrity rides to power in the Oval Office on Red Wave that reshaped the Republican part in Reagan’s image much as Trump has reshaped the current GOP in his. 

The only thing that spared him from a Carter landslide-like loss is his decision *not* to run for reelection in 24. A decision that came too late as it would turn out, but one saved him from being seen as a total failure unfortunately for him he’s almost 100 years old (or he looks like he’s almost 100 years old) so he won’t have the redemption arc Carter had with Habitat for Humanity.

He’ll die a one-term who will chiefly be remembered for his “senility”, the worst presidential debate performance of all time and the apathy by which most people greeted his arrival, his tenure and his departure from office.

1ldftpo,CMV: Americans and people in the West who believe the Russian talking points about the war against Ukraine are some of the stupidest people in the world,"I understand the title comes across as harsh, but this is true as it gets. With Russians living in russia it makes sense why they believe the lies told, but for Americans and people in the west that have access to information free from the russian state, it just stupid.

Let me be crystal clear: I'm not saying that every single person who questions the war in Ukraine is stupid. Nor am I saying that questioning U.S. foreign policy will necessarily turn one into an ignorant individual. But when I hear people in the West—especially Americans—parrot talking points verbatim from the Kremlin propaganda machine, I can't help but question that we're working with some of the most gullible, uninformed, and plain stupidest individuals on this earth.

You don't have to be a geopolitical sage to see what's going on. A nuclear power dictatorship ruled by a man in office longer than the majority of Reddit users have been alive bombs a sovereign democratic neighbor. It takes land, kills civilians, and targets infrastructure—flagrant violations of international law. And still, there are Western apologists for it.

Some of the arguments I continually hear:

""NATO provoked Russia.""
Even if you believe that NATO expansion was a failure, nobody can explain an all-out invasion of a country that did not pose a threat to Russia. Ukraine was far from joining NATO when the invasion began.

""Ukraine is corrupt.""
True, but so is Russia—on a far larger and more systemic scale. Ukraine was (and continues to) work towards reforms and conduct democratic elections. Russia poisons journalists, jails opposition, and occupies neighbors. If corruption deserves an invasion, half the world is up for sale.

""The U.S. does bad things too.""
Yes, America does have a dirty history. That is no reason for Russia to be given a free pass to commit war crimes. This is the most idiotic whataboutism. Two wrongs do not make a right.

""It's all fake news, Ukraine is losing, it's just Western propaganda.""
This is astounding. Westerners with access to free media fall for easily debunked propaganda from state-run Russian sources. They gobble up blatantly staged ""news"" segments, fake maps, and appallingly terrible military analysis. If you believe that RT or some Telegram account with a hammer and sickle avatar avatar is providing you with the ""real story,"" I've got a bridge to sell you.


To believe these talking points is to disregard mountains of evidence, credible reporting, satellite imagery, war crimes reports, and the lived experiences of tens of millions of Ukrainians. And for what? To feel like you're ""not like the sheep,"" that you ""know the truth"" when in fact you've been conned by one of the most well-documented propaganda operations of the last century?

This kind of idiocy is not innocuous either. It undermines democratic solidarity with Ukraine, emboldens authoritarian governments, and mocks the very principle of truth in the public sphere. It's not ""just an opinion"" when it is grounded on falsehoods, and it is openly calling for a war of aggression.

So certain, I'll say it again: if you live in a free country that can access facts and still choose to believe Putin's disinformation, then you're voluntarily ignorant, intellectually lazy, or woefully gullible.

Donald Trump has made sexual comments about her daughter over the years. In one of them he says: ""...a beauty, if I weren't happily married, and, you know, his father..."", he considers ""being happily married"" the primary reason for him to not be with his daughter. On another talk show, they ask him what is his common interests with his daughter and, again, he says ""well I was going to say SEX, but I can't relate this with her..."".

176cb77,CMV: CEOs are not special talents that deserve tens of millions,"I was reading another thread that made some pretty good points about a CEOs value, but they only barely seem to hold up due to circumstance, and I hope there's more to it.

People wrote that top CEOs are tireless workers, who dedicate their entire life to the success of an entity. That may be true, but tons of regular people do this. One huge example are the millions of poor families that have individuals who sacrifice most of their waking hours to ensure some quality of life for their dependents. This behavior is not even minimally unique to top CEOs. Furthermore, executive positions rarely have any meaningful personal financial stakes, or otherwise (they already made it). The main reason for their absurd pay, appears to be because they are allowed to dictate it, and that societies prioritize shareholders over laborers. If laborers were protected and prioritized, it would be seemingly impossible to justify an absurd CEO salary.

I have also read that CEOs successfully manage tons of important relationships, and have to make enormous decisions every day. This is also not unique to top CEOs. Again, I will use a common example with higher personal stakes, which are working poor families. The working poor often have to succesfully deal with tons of people who have power over THEM (often sociopaths), under the threat of homelessness, daily. Their decisions and sacrifices are what make every difference for them and their families. CEOs have entire teams dedicated to making their decisions easier. The important relationships that CEOs manage are likely people with mutual interests, from the same absurd social class (low personal stakes in terms of financial security), which is hardly the most testing thing one can imagine.

Another thing I read is that CEOs tie together a lot of expertise from different departments. This is also not unique and even less special, in light of the people who manage the actual products and projects that truly define the success of a large company. In a large company, the departments must surely be connected by much more than an individual. A large successful company always looks more likely to succeed in spite of an owner, or CEO (Twitter), than it is to be helped in any way that isn't hollow, or related to perceptions. The stock market is seemingly ruled in large part by perception, and the directive is already built in, which is to make more money and cut costs. The CEO would be the friendly face that they know, and who makes the investors feel better. Someone who will pull the trigger on those nasty directives, and look good doing it, but not much more. If that's most of it, how does the position deserve 400 percent more than anybody?

I feel like the only reason this absurdity thrives, is the stock market. A market which is largely incoherent, needing regulation, and way too big to fail. The modern CEO seems to be the clown steward of our system's broken promises, and a vestige of our monotheistic worldview, but not some special genius.

I would love to know of any reason that a CEOs vast inequality makes sense, outside of a greedy/emotional stock market, and the directive for infinite growth that apparently needs a friendly/confident face to execute it. They really do seem to me to just be a bad person, that can market themselves as a good person, and push some dark directives, while only concerning themselves with initiatives that support those directives. It would be nice not to feel that shitty about all of it.

Another example that was used in the other thread was Messi, the soccer player, getting paid much more than others. But Messi represents labor and the object of consumption, not administration, so that doesn't work.",bohrmachine,1236,0.8299999833106995,701,1697131293,2023-10-12

with mutual interests from the same absurd social class low personal stakes in terms of financial security which is hardly the most testing thing one can imagine another thing i read is that ceos tie together a lot of expertise from different departments this is also not unique and even less special in light of the people who manage the actual products and projects that truly define the success of

than others but messi represents labor and the object of consumption not administration so that doesn t work,0,cmv ceos are not special talents that deserve tens of millions i was reading another thread that made some pretty good points about a ceos value but they only barely seem to hold up due to circumstance and i hope there s more to it people wrote that top ceos are tireless workers who dedicate their entire life to the success of an entity that may be true but tons of regular people do this one huge example are the millions of poor families that have individuals who sacrifice most of their waking hours to ensure some quality of life for their dependents this behavior is not even minimally unique to top ceos furthermore executive positions rarely have any meaningful personal financial stakes or otherwise they already made it the main reason for their absurd pay appears to be because they are allowed to dictate it and that societies prioritize shareholders over laborers if laborers were protected and prioritized it would be seemingly impossible to justify an absurd ceo salary i have also read that ceos successfully manage tons of important relationships and have to make

1hcxwer,CMV: Reddit's male spaces are completely broken and no longer represent men at all.,"I genuinely want someone to try change my mind on this because it's such a disparaging thought.

I've recently had a bit of an experience in r/askmenadvice that really irked me. I have found myself on the receiving end of the bullshit and seen some things I really don't like about collective male behaviour on Reddit.

Here's an example thread (on mobile so I'll edit with the link in a sec.

I have literally just been trying to argue my point that these spaces are public despite having 'men' in the name, and that we should be kinder and more considerate. There are 1000+ people reading even 0 upvote posts, who may be damaged by the casual women bashing that is so common, and many people have admitted to me that women should expect. They are extremely unlikely to participate because of the backlash.

These loud few boys do not take any accountability for how their actions affect other people. I do not care how old they are, they are simply not emotionally men yet if that's how they think. I appreciate that they are hurting, but choosing not to grow up has never been and will never be a successful strategy for coping with the real world.

In my opinion, men take responsibility. This is true for every happily married man I know IRL.

Approx 95% of the 'men' I've interacted with in these spaces are telling me the following:

1. I'm too angry/emotional with my argument - which implies my opinion as a man is invalid (feeling my emotions does not scare me now I've sought therapy)
2. That vulnerable people should not access these spaces if they can't handle it (that doesn't change that they still will)

Particularly concerning is that the sub descriptions openly have rules like 'be nice' and say that men are keen to open up their feminine side.

Staying cold and distant ain't the way to do it. Becoming a man for me has been all about understanding my emotions and exercising them helpfully.

Things that will CMV:

- Examples of reddit male spaces that aren't like this
- Genuine discussion of where my cognitive dissonance may lie on the matter

Things that will not CMV:

- Being told I am being dramatic/too angry/emotional about this. I feel very passionately about this and I will not censor myself when I've just expressed an opinion that I feel most men IRL share with me.
- Being told that's just the way it is, and I should ignore it. I believe that men can moderate ourselves and take responsibility better.

From my perspective, while I appreciate people need to vent to heal, Male Reddit is making things much, much worse. It's actually become a barrier to proper growth for anyone who interacts with them regularly and thinks it's normal.

So please CMV, because I am clearly hurting about this in the dark somewhat and I'd like to see the light.",ponderous_pete,352,0.6100000143051147,623,1734044275,2024-12-12

17m7807,CMV: Bottled Water is the world's most successful scam,"To start off, allow me to admit that I understand there are cases where bottled water is necessary such as in the recovery of a natural disaster or if tap water is unsafe to drink due to contamination.

That said, for the vast majority of people in the First World, bottled water is a massively overpriced scam.

Firstly, bottled water companies upcharge massively due to the cost of producing plastic bottles, so bottled water costs hundreds of times more than tap water. It would be like paying $300 for something you can get for $1.

Secondly, bottled water is unnecessary if your concern is purification/safety since municipal systems are actually held to similar, if not higher, standards. The bottled water industry actually often uses the same source in fact.

Thirdly, bottled water is perishable since the microplastics break down. I'm sensitive to it. To me, bottled water tastes terrible because it makes me think of liquid plastic.

Fourthly, bottled water is a huge strain on the environment.",Dawntodusk87,413,0.8399999737739563,302,1698941971,2023-11-02 11:19:31,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17m7807/cmv_bottled_water_is_the_worlds_most_successful/,11,2023,0.02548955256536484,0.07223422126229902,0.04886188691383193,cmv bottled water is the world s most successful scam,to start off allow me to admit that i understand there are cases where bottled water is necessary such as in the recovery of a natural disaster or if tap water is unsafe to drink due to contamination that said for the vast majority of people in the first world bottled water is a massively overpriced scam firstly bottled water companies upcharge massively due to the cost of producing plastic bottles so bottled water costs hundreds of times more than tap water it would be like paying 300 for something you can get for 1 secondly bottled water is unnecessary if your concern is purification safety since municipal systems are actually held to similar if not higher standards the bottled water industry actually often uses the same source in fact thirdly bottled water is perishable since the microplastics break down i m sensitive to it to me bottled water tastes terrible because it makes me think of liquid plastic fourthly bottled water is a huge strain on the environment,0,cmv bottled water is the world s most successful scam to start off allow me to admit that i understand there are cases where bottled water is necessary such as in the recovery of a natural disaster or if tap water is unsafe to drink due to contamination that said for the vast majority of people in the first world bottled water is a massively overpriced scam firstly bottled water companies upcharge massively due to the cost of producing plastic bottles so bottled water costs hundreds of times more than tap water it would be like paying 300 for something you can get for 1 secondly bottled water is unnecessary if your concern is purification safety since municipal systems are actually held to similar if not higher standards the bottled water industry actually often uses the same source in fact thirdly bottled water is perishable since the microplastics break down i m sensitive to it to me bottled water tastes terrible because it makes me think of liquid plastic fourthly bottled water is a huge strain on the environment
1d1y22j,"CMV: If Israel wishes to establish international credibility, it should get third parties to investigate the major incidents that took place in Gaza.","Yesterday it was reported that an airstrike in Rafah has resulted in at least 45 deaths, many of which women and children. There are even pictures of charred and decapitated babies coming out. All the videos we saw are horrific. Bibi has already called it a [""tragic mistake""](https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/netanyahu-acknowledges-tragic-mistake-after-rafah-strike-kills-dozens-of-palestinians/) and the IDF will investigate the incident.

This is not the first time the IDF has had a high-profile incident that warrants investigation. Others include the killing of 7 WCK aid workers, the killing of the 3 Israeli hostages, and the Flour Massacre that killed more than 100 Palestinians. In the case of the 7 WCK aid workers, the investigation was reportedly [""hurried completed""](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/05/israeli-inquiry-blames-wck-aid-killings-on-grave-errors-by-military-personnel) and was unlikely to be [transparent and honest](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/02/israeli-strike-on-jose-andres-aid-group-prompts-new-level-of-us-backlash-00150245). The killing of the 3 Israeli hostages did not result in anyone reprimanded or dismissed despite a clear violation of rule of engagement that heavily tanked IDF's reputation. On the Flour Massacre, Israel's version of event has been [doubted](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/09/middleeast/gaza-food-aid-convoy-deaths-eyewitness-intl-investigation-cmd/index.html) by CNN too.

Suffice to say, it's unlikely that the IDF will investigate yesterday's incident or any other incident in a transparent, honest manner with proper accountability to those responsible. Without doing so, Israel's international credibility is rightfully tarnished and gives other institutions like the ICC ground to investigate Israeli officials. (Note that the ICC only investigate individuals when their home country's justice system is incapable of punishing war criminals.) It should get third parties that involve an international team of experts to investigate these incidents to clear its name or to hold those responsible accountable.

1glc7i8,CMV: One of the biggest flaws European Liberal party’s made the last decade was not combating islamist extremism.,"I know titles like this leave room for interpretation so before I start some information. I’m a 19 year old, Atheist, bisexual dude who is very left-leaning on social issues and more centrist on economical issues. No I don’t think people from Muslim countries or Muslims are inherently evil or that religion in general is stupid.

One of the trends we can see in the last decades is that islamist extremism and terrorism is on the rise. Even in Europe which tended to be becoming more atheist and liberal Christian in the last decades. This has given right wing populist an extremely successful target and led to the success of right wing parties in recent years.

Liberal party’s were to scared that they seemed racist if they even addressed problems related to Islam which is a thing that still baffles me because textbook Islam(like many religions) is inherently anti feminist and homophobic so one would assume that liberal party’s would try to protect women’s and queer rights/safety.

1cwq65v,CMV: it is perfectly reasonable of the ICC prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for leaders of Hamas *and* of Israel for alleged crimes against humanity,"I’m feeling like the world has gone mad in its general reaction to this move by the ICC prosecutor.

We have Biden and others calling it outrageous to suggest equivalence between Israel and Hamas (which it would be) but that’s not at all what the ICC prosecutor has done - he’s just said ‘name’ is suspected of this list of bad things, and ‘name’ is suspected of this other list of bad things, with evidence, and those allegations are serious enough that there is potentially a case to answer. 

I’ve also seen people on Israeli subs saying although they might hate Netanyahu, the ICC has lost the plot. Like: ‘he’s a criminal but obviously not THAT kind of criminal!’, and saying the ICC should turn its attention to the real crims in Russia or North Korea instead. But, jurisdictional issues aside, why would you not want scrutiny of all leaders responsible for massive loss of life? Even the strongest supporter of Israel’s right to defend itself should surely be concerned about how exactly that defending is done? And there are lots of features of Israel’s warfare that should at least prompt cause for concern (disproportionate fatalities, friendly fire, dead aid workers, soldier misconduct)

Meanwhile Hamas says the move equates victim with executioner. Same point applies as above, that leaders on both sides might have some charges in common, but the question in each case is “did this person do this stuff?” NOT “is this person better/worse than that person?” Also I don’t believe there is any doubt that Hamas ordered deliberate killing of civilians and taking of hostages. The whole point of the concept of war crimes is that it doesn’t matter how righteous or justified you feel, or how nasty war is - you should never do them. 

Are we really so addicted to “good guy vs bad guy” narratives that we can’t bend our minds around the concept that maybe two sides, despite all sorts of legitimate grievances, can simultaneously inflict great evils on one another?

Is it perhaps that it’s such a complex situation the moderates stay quiet so the polar extremes dominate the airtime?

Or am I missing something here? I see no sensible reason for calling the ICC’s (very preliminary) move anything other than reasonable, or anything short of exactly what we should want to see in modern civilisation.

1g016fw,CMV: Being pro-Palestine is not antisemitic,"I suppose most of this line of thinking is caused by the people who want to erase Israel from the map entirely along with its Jewish inhabitants which is as antisemitic as it gets, so to clear up, I mean pro-Palestine as in: against having innocent Palestinians barely surviving in apartheid conditions and horrified by 40 000 people (and other 100 000 injured) being killed and it being justified by many / most of the world as rightful protection of the state. I am not pro-Hamas, I can understand a degree of frustration from being in a blockade for years, but what happened on October 7 was no doubt inhumane... but even calling what's been happening over the past year a war feels for how one-sided is the conflict really feels laughable (as shown by the death toll).  
  
I browsed the Jewish community briefly to try to see another point of view but I didn't expect to see the majority of posts just talking about how every pro-Palestinian is uneducated, stupid, suspectible to propaganda and antisemitic. Without explaining why that would be, it either felt like a) everyone in the community was on the same wave-length so there was no need to explain or b) they just said that to hate on anyone who didn't share their values. As an outsider, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it's possible that I hold my current views because I'm ""uneducated"", I have admittedly spent only a relatively short amount of time trying to understand the conflict and I'm not very good with keeping historical facts without having them written somewhere... but again, I reserve my right to identify what goes against basic human principles because it shouldn't ever be gatekept, so I doubt any amount of information would be able to make me switch 180 degrees suddenly, but there is room for some nuance. 

Anyway, I'm assuming the basic gist is: being pro-Palestine > being anti-Israel > being anti-Zionist > being antisemitic (as most Jews are in fact Zionists). I find this assessment to having made a lapse of judgement somewhere along the way. Similarly to how I'm pro-Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza, I'm not anti-Israel / Jewish people, I am against (at least morally, as I'm not a part of the conflict) what the Israel government is doing and against people who agree with their actions. I'm sorry that Jewish people have to expect antisemitism coming from any corner nowadays, as someone who is a part of another marginalized community I know the feeling well, but assuming everyone wants me dead just fuels the ""us vs them"" mentality.

1gly6bc,CMV: Terms Like 'Incel' Prove That We Reduce People's Worth to Sexual Success,"Let’s start with the term “incel,” which often reduces a person’s value to whether they succeed in the dating world. I think this is a narrow view. After all, it overlooks bigger struggles, like isolation and the lack of meaningful relationships, which are real issues. When we focus only on sexual success, we miss the chance to understand deeper emotional needs and human dignity.

Indeed, not all men who identify as “incels” (or are labeled as such) see others as mere objects for sex. However, the culture around the term often promotes (and proves) a transactional view of relationships, where human connections are reduced to something that validates someone’s identity. In my opinion, this directly takes away from the true depth and respect that relationships should have.

Of course, misogyny, toxic masculinity, and objectifying women are serious problems, no doubt. But I think the bigger issue is that society struggles to understand human dignity. We need to see each other as whole, multi-dimensional people, not as objects to conquer or manipulate. Respect should come from this deeper recognition.

Yeah, relationships are naturally complicated, and we all want intimacy and connection. But they shouldn’t be seen as transactions, where someone’s worth is based only on what they can give in return.

In the end, I believe that sexual success should never define a person’s worth or the health of a relationship. So, when society overemphasises it, we set up unrealistic expectations, frustration, and lose sight of the emotional bonds that make relationships last.

Consequently, societal expectations impact relationships, but we need spaces where people can connect authentically, without pressure to meet shallow standards. The goal isn’t to eliminate all expectations but to shift the focus away from appearances or sexual success and make room for genuine, meaningful connections.",borisdandorra,673,0.6399999856948853,732,1731006127,2024-11-07 13:02:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gly6bc/cmv_terms_like_incel_prove_that_we_reduce_peoples/,11,2024,0.053932830106115305,0.1754259659227262,0.11467939801442074,cmv terms like incel prove that we reduce people s worth to sexual success,let s start with the term incel which often reduces a person s value to whether they succeed in the dating world i think this is a narrow view after all it overlooks bigger struggles like isolation and the lack of meaningful relationships which are real issues when we focus only on sexual success we miss the chance to understand deeper emotional needs and human dignity indeed not all men who identify as incels or are labeled as such see others as mere objects for sex however the culture around the term often promotes and proves a transactional view of relationships where human connections are reduced to something that validates someone s identity in my opinion this directly takes away from the true depth and respect that relationships should have of course misogyny toxic masculinity and objectifying women are serious problems no doubt but i think the bigger issue is that society struggles to understand human dignity we need to see each other as whole multi dimensional people not as objects to conquer or manipulate respect should come from this deeper recognition yeah relationships are naturally complicated and we all want intimacy and connection but they shouldn t be seen as transactions where someone s worth is based only on what they can give in return in the end i believe that sexual success should never define a person s worth or the health of a relationship so when society overemphasises it we set up unrealistic expectations frustration and lose sight of the emotional bonds that make relationships last consequently societal expectations impact relationships but we need spaces where people can connect authentically without pressure to meet shallow standards the goal isn t to eliminate all expectations but to shift the focus away from appearances or sexual success and make room for genuine meaningful connections,0,cmv terms like incel prove that we reduce people s worth to sexual success let s start with the term incel which often reduces a person s value to whether they succeed in the dating world i think this is a narrow view after all it overlooks bigger struggles like isolation and the lack of meaningful relationships which are real issues when we focus only on sexual success we miss the chance to understand deeper emotional needs and human dignity indeed not all men who identify as incels or are labeled as such see others as mere objects for sex however the culture around the term often promotes and proves a transactional view of relationships where human connections are reduced to something that validates someone s identity in my opinion this directly takes away from the true depth and respect that relationships should have of course misogyny toxic masculinity and objectifying women are serious problems no doubt but i think the bigger issue is that society struggles to understand human dignity we need to see each other as whole multi dimensional people not as objects to conquer or manipulate respect should come from this deeper recognition yeah relationships are naturally complicated and we all want intimacy and connection but they shouldn t be seen as transactions where someone s worth is based only on what they can give in return in the end i believe that sexual success should never define a person s worth or the health of a relationship so when society overemphasises it we set up unrealistic expectations frustration and lose sight of the emotional bonds that make relationships last consequently societal expectations impact relationships but we need spaces where people can connect authentically without pressure to meet shallow standards the goal isn t to eliminate all expectations but to shift the focus away from appearances or sexual success and make room for genuine meaningful connections
1lxhcqw,CMV: food delivery places like Domino's and Papa John's destroyed drivers tips when they added a delivery charge.,"Like a lot of teenagers, I delivered Pizza when I was young. And I made incredible money. People tip to you a dollar or two, for a pizza, more for several.  Later on, I'll admit after I left delivery work, food delivery started with the delivery charge. From almost every pizza delivery driver I have talked to over the past few years, they know where make what they used to. This is with gas prices a lot higher, and the cost of living. Many people assume that when you're paying a delivery charge, that covers the driver. Then you had the option of contactless delivery due to covid, so people didn't even have to face the drivers and stopped tipping them even more.

1hksiq5,CMV: Reddit is a far left echo chamber.,"The general reputation of Reddit is that it leans very far to the left, and if you use it much at all, you can easily understand why. Many of the largest subreddits are filled with progressive or far-left takes, and the way the site functions tends to amplify those perspectives. While plenty of communities cater to other ways of thinking, the general culture of Reddit is slanted left. It's become sort of an echo chamber for those ideas, and alternative views really don't get much traction.

First off, many of the most popular subreddits on Reddit have to do with progressive or socialist issues. Places like r/politics, r/antiwork, and r/latestagecapitalism are filled with posts railing against capitalism, billionaires, and big corporations. The discussions go beyond just pointing out problems, too—they can get really extreme. You see and hear people quite vociferously saying that billionaires don't deserve to exist and calling CEOs-bankrupting industries for profit, specifically the ones dealing in healthcare-are something people say quite easily; from basic 'Billionaires deserves to lose everything' comments up to and including outright physical or other forms of suggested violence. These posts gain thousands of upvotes, so they are on the front page, reinforcing the leftist vibe.

The voting system on Reddit makes the echo chamber effect even worse. If someone posts a comment or opinion that doesn't fit the dominant narrative-like a conservative or moderate take-it's usually downvoted so hard it disappears. On the other side, everything that corresponds to the popular left-leaning view is upvoted and moved to the top. That means just one side of the argument is really seen, while opposing viewpoints get buried or ignored. Over time, this just discourages people with different perspectives from even bothering to engage. Why post something if it's just going to get downvoted into oblivion?

Then, of course, there is the huge role of moderation in giving shape to the overall tone of the platform. Large subreddits are run by their moderators, who are themselves often very left-leaning. They can be very quick to remove posts or ban users if they don't agree with the content, even when it doesn't break any rules. Such moderation makes a one-sided space where alternative viewpoints are not just unpopular but also actively suppressed. It's unsurprising that people view Reddit as a hostile place for anyone who doesn't align with progressive values.

Another reason has to do with the makeup of the site's users: The users go for a younger, more technologically hip audience that can easily go to the left on social issues and politics. Users interact and upvote this content as it speaks for their views, only to increase the presence of the left on this site. Now, for those right-leaning areas of Reddit-areas such as r/Conservative or r/libertarian-they exist but pale in size to the big left leaning behemoths.

At the end of the day, Reddit is not completely bereft of other viewpoints, but the way the site is structured makes it incredibly hard for them to be heard. From the voting system to the heavy-handed moderation to the demographics of the user base, Reddit has devolved into a leftist echo chamber where everything else is drowned out. No surprise there, really, when people think of it that way.

1h9o6wr,CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term.,"Before I present my case, I want to get two things out of the way. One, I am a Democrat who voted for Kamala Harris, so I would very much like to be wrong. Two, this analysis does not take into account the possibility that no future elections are held. While I'm not convinced US elections are over forever, half of Reddit seems to be. Anyway, here's why I believe the Democrats are fucked even if democracy remains intact.

The 2024 election should have been a lay-up for Kamala Harris. Biden and Trump were both historically unpopular nominees, so much so that a man changed his legal name to ""Literally Anybody Else"" and ran a joke campaign. Biden was replaced by Harris in July, leading to tons of enthusiasm and small-dollar donations on the Democratic side. The economy was (and is) doing considerably better than in most other countries, including wealthy European nations. Most importantly, her opponent was a senile old man whose inaction led to the deaths of over a million people in the United States alone, was the only head of state to deny climate change, and tried to overthrow the government on his way out. Despite having the easiest possible set of circumstances with which to win a presidential election, *she still lost.*

Furthermore, rural voters are never going to vote for Democrats again. Local media, commonly cited as an antidote to polarization, has shriveled up, to be replaced by right-wing talk radio. Now, if Democrats could lose those areas by 30 points instead of 50 points, that would go a long way in the swing states. However, they don't just need swing states to remain viable as a national party (more on that later). Additionally, the 2024 election saw urban centers, people of color, and many other demographics that traditionally vote for Democrats swing violently rightward. As a 24-year-old man myself, I'm shocked but not surprised that Trump outright won men under 30. And I don't think they're coming back, because the Democrats won't embrace alternative media - there will never be a left-wing Joe Rogan. If the Democrats can't make up ground in rural areas, but also lose core parts of their base, they are doomed.

The situation is even more dire in the Senate, especially important because the Senate is the only chamber that can confirm or block nominees to the judiciary. Even with a 47-seat minority, the Democrats will still control both seats in several states that voted for Trump in this election. This includes both Arizona seats in a state Trump won by more than 5 percentage points. In other words, the Democrats are far more likely to lose Senate seats than to gain them in the long term. Even in the short term, the Democrats have just two pick-up opportunities in 2026 Senate - North Carolina (which has remained elusive for Democrats at the federal level since 2008!) and Maine (in which the unbeatable Susan Collins is likely to run again). Even if the Democrats can elect a President, they can only do so much without the Senate on their side, and if the judiciary gets right-wing enough, they will start green-lighting even more egregious voter suppression than we've already seen, which will eventually make it virtually impossible for Democrats to win again.

Finally, let's look at the media. In a craven display of anticipatory obedience, the Washington Post infamously did not endorse Kamala Harris this year. To make matters worse, MSNBC's Morning Joe (the channel of choice for the #Resistance) is already sucking up to Trump because they fear he'll try to shut them down. Trump would be foolish to shut them down, of course, because they're perhaps more responsible than anyone else for him returning to power. But in the period between the 2016 election and Trump's inauguration, I remember there being a lot more protests among both Democratic lawmakers and Democratic civilians than I see this time. That could partly be because the Kyle Rittenhouse precedent allows white vigilantes to murder protestors and get away with it, in which case I don't blame people for being too scared to protest. But the Democrats seem demoralized rather than angry, which is why I don't think they will engage in the necessary activism to resist Trump's worst policies.

1dx9e4e,CMV: It is wrong to refuse service to Israeli tourists solely due to their nationality.,"There was a video uploaded to r/PublicFreakout and various other subreddits purportedly showing a restaurant in Vietnam having a confrontation with an Israeli tourist. While I agree his behaviour in the video and the context behind it paints him as being a bad-faith actor, I was somewhat and disturbed by the sentiment shown in the comments.

A lot of people in Israel are against the continuation of the war. In fact, there have been constant protests against Netanyahu and his government for prioritising it over other means of freeing the hostages. It should go without saying that not all citizens supp kj
Itbzl
G  ort the actions of their government. This is true everywhere, whether in Russia, China, or any other dictatorship like Iran or Saudi Arabia. Many of which commit even worse human right abuses and are rightfully condemned. Would it be right to discriminate against a tourist from such a country? No, and even if they are in support of their government tons of tourists with objectionable views are served regularly without any problems.

If the tourist was the aggressor and had incited the confrontation it would be right to refuse service to him. But the comments heavily plied that it would be correct to refuse service to all Israelis. I cannot see this as anything other than discrimination based on nationality. It might not be racist as nationality aren’t races, but it would certainly be wrong. And when criticizing someone for their (geo)political beliefs, one should not extend their criticism to all members of a nationality or religion. “Fuck Israel” is often heard due to the actions of Netanyahu’s government, but “Fuck Gaza” is never said even though the comparably vile Hamas is in control of Gaza. To me both would be too blunt.

1fq27tb,CMV: Death is terrifying,"For the longest time, the idea of memento mori has brought much meaning and compassion to my life. I used to like the ""sting"" of knowing that I would die one day and it would remind me to treat every day as a gift. 

While I do generally still have this sentiment, I think it was relatively easy to acknowledge that I was going to die, while still subconsciously distancing myself from the reality of death because ""I still have my whole life ahead of me"" and ""I'm still young"". 

After experiencing some health scares and getting a firmer understanding of just how fleeting our lives are, I've started to feel a deep dread, and sometimes borderline panic attacks, when contemplating death. The infinite void of nothingness. This amazing spark of life, then it's gone *forever*. I know that I won't experience being dead. But still, the idea of nothingness after death terrifies me.

To be clear: I am not looking for advice on how to cope with the fear of death. I am rather curious about those of you who think that death is not scary, and why you think so. Why am I wrong about thinking that death is terrifying?

1klr1ed,"CMV: if there is a single thing Trump is right about, it’s the fact that NATO member states need to uphold their 2% spending financial commitments.","Before I get into my arguments, no I do not sympathize with Trump or his supporters in any way, shape, or form. Mr Trump and his administration seem to have genuine malicious intent. I politically consider myself to be center, I lean left on some issues and lean right on others. That being said, Mr Trump is not right. He is ultranationalist-level far right. Not a single one of my policy views align with his except the fact that NATO member states are acting in bad faith and need to face consequences if they do not comply with their commitments. 

While not binding, NATO member states have made formal commitments to spend at least 2% of their annual GDP on national defence. Given escalating tensions globally now (e.g., Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, Russia and Ukraine), it has become more important than ever for NATO allies to stand together in case things cascade into full-scale war. Unfortunately, many NATO member states seem to be free-riding on the NATO defence benefits—especially since a majority of spending is done by the U.S.—by contributing significantly less than 2% of their GDP to defence. Many do not even have a roadmap to reach that benchmark. Agreeing to do something, then failing to follow through while continuing to benefit from the security umbrella provided by others, is an act of bad faith and creates what in politics is known as the free-rider problem. The U.S. spends a disproportionate share of its annual budget on defence, while some ally states contribute little more than token amounts. This not only breeds resentment but also undermines the credibility and reliability in the alliance.

1dovp7x,"CMV: Not shooting Vladimir Makarov and his gang during ""No Russian"" in MW2 (2009) is one of the dumbest plot holes in video gaming history.","In the mission, you are walking behind Vladimir and his 3 men who are all not wearing any armor for, or protection on, their heads. They do not watch you. They do not even care if you never pull the trigger to kill civilians in the mission. PFC Joseph Allen could have easily shot and killed them all. He had an LMG with plenty of ammo, and was obviously trained in the military to where he could have handled it well. Makarov is even the one closest to you!!

The in universe reason given by Shepherd to Allen as to why Allen is going in to even do this is, and I quote directly from the game, ""It will cost you a piece of yourself. It will cost nothing compared to everything you'll save.""

In no world was any of the potential info that could have possibly been gained by staying in Makarov's circle been worth more than just killing Makarov on the spot. There was a prime opportunity to do what they've always wanted to do and bad/ignorant writing is the only thing that stopped it. 

I cannot think of any valid in universe reasons as to why Allen could not have shot at least just Makarov. In what world does a common-man military member (who is literally one step above private, which means he basically just completed boot camp) not stop the killing of literally hundreds, if not thousands of innocent people, let alone he actively participates in it???

I would have no issue with this if literally ANY coherent reason was given as to why it could not be done. Here's a few things that weren't written into the game, but if they were written in, it wouldn't be a plothole:

1. Makarov and gang is in full bulletproof outfits, obviously not allowing them to be fragged. This is just a character design change. Wouldn't have even needed to record dialog. 

2. Allen is forced to be in front as they don't trust the new guy, so he has to prove himself. You would be shot if you attempt to look at them with your gun, for example. 

3. The airport massacre and kill numbers weren't supposed to be anywhere close to this bad, in the eyes of Shepherd/America anyway. Whether this be because the target was unknown, or something else. 

4. There was someone above Makarov who they wanted, that successfully doing this would have lead them to.

5. Any piece of anything that would have been more valuable than Makarov and the stopping of his future atrocities if it existed. More valuable to everyone, by the way, not just more valuable to Shepherd. 

Please do what you can to change my mind because this bothers me so much. I'm open to hearing all potential points. I want my mind changed because other than this specific issue, I can suspend my disbelief for everything else wacky that happens.",Platinum--Jug,383,0.8600000143051147,116,1719399224,2024-06-26

19brluv,CMV: Sex offenders with more then 10 victims should be chemically castrated and sterilized for the betterment of society,"As harsh as it sounds I really do think it’s necessary. Nobody stumbles into the life of being a serial rapist. It’s not like some sexual assault cases where there’s some, if not nuance, then grey area. To be clear, the assault happening is unjustifiable and wrong no matter what, but the college frat boy who rapes a girl while she’s passed out at a party is different from a predator following a woman to her job, her gym, her house, waiting for a moment to kidnap her and get his rocks off. More time, planning, obsession and in some cases violence go into the latter type of offender.

The frat boy, in most cases I’ve seen, is opportunistic. They want sex. They’d prefer it consensually but if the girl is drunk and too fucked up to say “no” they’re fine with that too. Serial rapists however, they get off on the lack of consent. They get off on the resistance. They want the person to scream, fight and try and run. Domination is inextricably bound up with their sexual desire. 

Did anybody watch The Last of Us on HBO? Well, there’s a character just like that in the show. Someone that gets off on resistance. Someone like that can’t be reformed, retrained or redeemed. They’re wild dogs. And even if you could “tame” them, it’s still too risky in my opinion. A drunk who relapses will likely hurt themselves, either via alcohol poisoning or just your run-of-the-mill self-destruction of their lives. A junkie will likely be the same. Though the risk they betray a friend or family member and rob them for a quick fix is also a factor. They too are more likely to just OD and die.

A serial sex offender though? If they relapse someone is getting raped.

That risk is too much for me. Humans are animals, no? If an untrained/abused/mentally ill dog bites two or three kids, not matter how much their owners might love them, they’re getting put down for the benefit of society according to the state. Even if you could put them on meds or put them in a different environment there’s always the risk that down the line something could set them off and then it might not be a bitten kid you’re dealing with but a dead one. I feel like this is a happy medium for the criminal justice reformers and the tough-on-crime crowd. Because when the offender is “fixed”, we release them from prison free of the “urges” that would make them want to attack someone again, we save billions of dollars that would be otherwise spent on feeding and housing them, and the “law and order” crowd can sleep soundly knowing these guys are castrated and, though they’re free, will remain on a list for the rest of their lives.

1arqgnj,Cmv: People of colour absolutely can be racist,"The notion that black people and POC can’t be racist has become more prevalent in the last few years, usually explained by saying that racism is a system of oppression and because white people have not been traditionally systematically oppressed, they cannot be subject to racism.

My issue with this is that I believe people are mistaking racism with systematic oppression.

Racism as a word, to me at least  simply means prejudice based on race. Any prejudice that is based on someones race or ethnic background is an example of racism.

Systematic racism is a form of oppression based on racial characteristics, and it’s true that white people have rarely been held under these systems.

So the mistake people make is claiming that POC can’t be racist full stop, which is untrue, and actually a racist claim in itself. 

If somebody dislikes white people based on the colour of their skin or the acts of their ancestors that is racism in its rawest form, just like any other.",serialrimmer,606,0.7400000095367432,1211,1708031776,2024-02-15 15:16:16,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1arqgnj/cmv_people_of_colour_absolutely_can_be_racist/,2,2024,0.04660321627830653,0.2903767698584113,0.16848999306835893,cmv people of colour absolutely can be racist,the notion that black people and poc can t be racist has become more prevalent in the last few years usually explained by saying that racism is a system of oppression and because white people have not been traditionally systematically oppressed they cannot be subject to racism my issue with this is that i believe people are mistaking racism with systematic oppression racism as a word to me at least simply means prejudice based on race any prejudice that is based on someones race or ethnic background is an example of racism systematic racism is a form of oppression based on racial characteristics and it s true that white people have rarely been held under these systems so the mistake people make is claiming that poc can t be racist full stop which is untrue and actually a racist claim in itself if somebody dislikes white people based on the colour of their skin or the acts of their ancestors that is racism in its rawest form just like any other,1,cmv people of colour absolutely can be racist the notion that black people and poc can t be racist has become more prevalent in the last few years usually explained by saying that racism is a system of oppression and because white people have not been traditionally systematically oppressed they cannot be subject to racism my issue with this is that i believe people are mistaking racism with systematic oppression racism as a word to me at least simply means prejudice based on race any prejudice that is based on someones race or ethnic background is an example of racism systematic racism is a form of oppression based on racial characteristics and it s true that white people have rarely been held under these systems so the mistake people make is claiming that poc can t be racist full stop which is untrue and actually a racist claim in itself if somebody dislikes white people based on the colour of their skin or the acts of their ancestors that is racism in its rawest form just like any other
1i9u2h8,cmv: Trump was not a reasonable choice for president.,"Let me get this straight. I am German, and while I do have some horses in this race considering the US is such a large country that it effects me too, I am not nearly as effected as actual Americans. 

I am also left. I am not super politically active, but I know enough about Trump to dislike him. Aside from his treatment of minority groups such as LGBTQ people and his ignorance of climate change, I also dislike his economic tatiff plans for the US and how they seem to mostly help the 1%. Project 2025 is also a whole different can of worms. And I also heard something about him raising the prices for medicine already. And his relationship to Elon who supports the AFD, did two nazi gestures and censors Twitter is.. well. You know it.

Once again, I am not super into politics but the fact that Trump actually got elected surprised me. In hindsight I shouldnt of been, but I thought ""someone like THAT won't be voted AGAIN, they can't be this dumb. He dodged a question about border security with aliens eating cats and dogs."" 

But here we are.

But I want to try and be unbiased. I dont even want you to prove to me that he was a better choice, just a reasonable one. Make me say ""Well I disagree but I can see why one might think like that.""

1ip14zv,CMV: I have become racist.,"I live in Atlanta (in the city not the suburbs), born and raised here. I live/ and have grown up, in a diverse neighborhood, blacks, whites, hispanics, and a couple asian families as well. I am white. I tend to have mostly black friends, don't know why it just kind of happened. I was also raised in a very liberal family, always taught to never judge others, be kind to everyone, diversity is amazing, black lives matter etc (my entire family is like this). As I've gotten older its very hard to ignore the obvious things i see around me. Almost all crimes in my area are by black people. In my schools the people getting in fights, disrespecting teachers, all black. When I'm walking on the street or in public transportation, only black people will threaten me, be obnoxiously loud on the phone, or play loud music disregarding everyone else. My parents are from the north, grew up around practically only white people, I began to realize how easy it was for them to have their believes as they did not grow up around any other races. So when i'm walking home at night and see a black person with a hood up coming towards me, I do cross the road, the past 20 years of my life have taught me that. I dont want to be racist, I'd love to say that everyone is nice and I would never judge someone based on something that they cant even change, but I don't think I can.",TraditionalReturn357,1299,0.7699999809265137,1251,1739502731,2025-02-13 21:12:11,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ip14zv/cmv_i_have_become_racist/,2,2025,0.12241549064653758,0.2999760019198464,0.211195746283192,cmv i have become racist,i live in atlanta in the city not the suburbs born and raised here i live and have grown up in a diverse neighborhood blacks whites hispanics and a couple asian families as well i am white i tend to have mostly black friends don t know why it just kind of happened i was also raised in a very liberal family always taught to never judge others be kind to everyone diversity is amazing black lives matter etc my entire family is like this as i ve gotten older its very hard to ignore the obvious things i see around me almost all crimes in my area are by black people in my schools the people getting in fights disrespecting teachers all black when i m walking on the street or in public transportation only black people will threaten me be obnoxiously loud on the phone or play loud music disregarding everyone else my parents are from the north grew up around practically only white people i began to realize how easy it was for them to have their believes as they did not grow up around any other races so when i m walking home at night and see a black person with a hood up coming towards me i do cross the road the past 20 years of my life have taught me that i dont want to be racist i d love to say that everyone is nice and i would never judge someone based on something that they cant even change but i don t think i can,0,cmv i have become racist i live in atlanta in the city not the suburbs born and raised here i live and have grown up in a diverse neighborhood blacks whites hispanics and a couple asian families as well i am white i tend to have mostly black friends don t know why it just kind of happened i was also raised in a very liberal family always taught to never judge others be kind to everyone diversity is amazing black lives matter etc my entire family is like this as i ve gotten older its very hard to ignore the obvious things i see around me almost all crimes in my area are by black people in my schools the people getting in fights disrespecting teachers all black when i m walking on the street or in public transportation only black people will threaten me be obnoxiously loud on the phone or play loud music disregarding everyone else my parents are from the north grew up around practically only white people i began to realize how easy it was for them to have their believes as they did not grow up around any other races so when i m walking home at night and see a black person with a hood up coming towards me i do cross the road the past 20 years of my life have taught me that i dont want to be racist i d love to say that everyone is nice and i would never judge someone based on something that they cant even change but i don t think i can
1fes0nh,CMV: Israel Should Be Sanctioned for Killing an American Citizen Today,"My view is that this issue has reached a boiling point. This is not the first US citizen that Israel has killed American citizens. Credible claims point to no less than five American citizens whom Israel has claimed responsibility for killing (one way or another) in the recent past.

The most recent incident is particularly alarming in my view and does warrant actual sanctions as a response. Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was killed by a bullet Israel alleges was aimed at the **leader of a protest.** Amazingly to me, the White House has *hatched* a completely far fetched idea suggesting a sniper bullet ""ricochet"" caused an American civilian to be shot in the head and killed.

The glaring issue for me is that (just like in the case of Saudi Arabia) I do not understand why we are choosing to keep the taps flowing on money to ""allies"" who are carrying out **extra-judicial** killings of journalists or protesters, especially American citizens. My view is that a strongly worded letter, as promised by the White House, is simply not enough.

Proverbs 29:7 
A righteous man knows the rights of the poor; a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.

Deuteronomy 15:7-8
""If among you, one of your brothers should become poor, in any of your towns within your land that the LorD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother, but you shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need, whatever it may be.

Corinthians 8:9 
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich.

John 3:17 
But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?

""If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you.

You shall give to him freely, and your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him, because for this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake.

As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.

Psalm 68:10 
Your flock found a dwelling in it; in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy.

Psalm 112:9 
He has distributed freely; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn is exalted in honor.

towns within your land that the lord your god is giving you you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother but you shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need whatever it may be corinthians 8 9 for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor so that you by his poverty might become rich john 3

himself with you you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner and he shall live with you luke 12 33 sell your possessions and give to the needy provide yourselves with moneybags

1ldmwzr,CMV: Single Payer Healthcare is 100% better than what the vast majority of Americans are doing,"Popular opinion here, I’m sure. Not a karma farm, really looking for people to tell me something other than what I’m experiencing.

First, I’m one of the few Americans currently using a “socialized” healthcare system: The VA. I’ve had cheap medical care previously (about $800 a year for three daily meds and roughly 8x yearly visits including ER and specialists) and I currently have free medical care (disabled veteran status)

Talking to my family about dealing with severe chronic illness before age 40, I got them to stop worrying about my health with one sentence:

“The biggest indicators of longevity are usually genetics and access to quality healthcare.”

Now I spent the last hour on the phone playing tag with the local hospital and the VA about a bill the hospital still thinks needs paying and the VA says is closed. That sucks. I was thinking about complaining about how much it sucks. But every single person I know who has to pay insurance and copays has had the same experience.

So, if you’re for the current American healthcare system: why? What are you getting out of it?",humanguy31,621,0.8299999833106995,651,1750166323,2025-06-17 08:18:43,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ldmwzr/cmv_single_payer_healthcare_is_100_better_than/,6,2025,0.04824417459796521,0.15598752099832014,0.10211584779814267,cmv single payer healthcare is 100 better than what the vast majority of americans are doing,popular opinion here i m sure not a karma farm really looking for people to tell me something other than what i m experiencing first i m one of the few americans currently using a socialized healthcare system the va i ve had cheap medical care previously about 800 a year for three daily meds and roughly 8x yearly visits including er and specialists and i currently have free medical care disabled veteran status talking to my family about dealing with severe chronic illness before age 40 i got them to stop worrying about my health with one sentence the biggest indicators of longevity are usually genetics and access to quality healthcare now i spent the last hour on the phone playing tag with the local hospital and the va about a bill the hospital still thinks needs paying and the va says is closed that sucks i was thinking about complaining about how much it sucks but every single person i know who has to pay insurance and copays has had the same experience so if you re for the current american healthcare system why what are you getting out of it,0,cmv single payer healthcare is 100 better than what the vast majority of americans are doing popular opinion here i m sure not a karma farm really looking for people to tell me something other than what i m experiencing first i m one of the few americans currently using a socialized healthcare system the va i ve had cheap medical care previously about 800 a year for three daily meds and roughly 8x yearly visits including er and specialists and i currently have free medical care disabled veteran status talking to my family about dealing with severe chronic illness before age 40 i got them to stop worrying about my health with one sentence the biggest indicators of longevity are usually genetics and access to quality healthcare now i spent the last hour on the phone playing tag with the local hospital and the va about a bill the hospital still thinks needs paying and the va says is closed that sucks i was thinking about complaining about how much it sucks but every single person i know who has to pay insurance and copays has had the same experience so if you re for the current american healthcare system why what are you getting out of it
1h3fhh0,CMV: Liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only,"For a democracy to thrive it needs the following (among others):

* A population that agrees on facts: Therefore, channels of information (e.g., podcasts, social media, and traditional media) need to be able to distribute fair and accurate information to the public.
* A population that is informed of their civic duty and is willing to honor them: This means that political participation should be enabled as much as possible e.g by making voting as easy as possible, but most importantly by making education much more than just preparation for a job, but more about how to function as a participant in a society where democracy is the political system
* A political system that is not corrupted by money and special interests: i.e. shouldn't be allowed to buy votes or pay (donate to) politicians to pass favorable legislation.

Around the world, all of the above points are being undermined for example in the EU one of the vice presidents of the EU parliament was arrested for accepting bribes from Qatar, see here: [https://www.politico.eu/article/mep-kaili-charged-with-corruption-by-belgian-prosecutors-reports/](https://www.politico.eu/article/mep-kaili-charged-with-corruption-by-belgian-prosecutors-reports/)

There are many examples of the lack or deterioration of the above basic requirements in numerous places hence my view is that liberal democracies will eventually only be democracies in name only in the future unless we find a way of fixing the :

* information sources so that people can agree on the facts
* Voting is made easier and people understand their civic duty
* Remove corruption from politics.",kindly102,382,0.800000011920929,200,1732982133,2024-11-30 09:55:33,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h3fhh0/cmv_liberal_democracies_are_decaying_into/,11,2024,0.0220982387047369,0.04775617950563955,0.03492720910518822,cmv liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only,for a democracy to thrive it needs the following among others a population that agrees on facts therefore channels of information e g podcasts social media and traditional media need to be able to distribute fair and accurate information to the public a population that is informed of their civic duty and is willing to honor them this means that political participation should be enabled as much as possible e g by making voting as easy as possible but most importantly by making education much more than just preparation for a job but more about how to function as a participant in a society where democracy is the political system a political system that is not corrupted by money and special interests i e shouldn t be allowed to buy votes or pay donate to politicians to pass favorable legislation around the world all of the above points are being undermined for example in the eu one of the vice presidents of the eu parliament was arrested for accepting bribes from qatar see here there are many examples of the lack or deterioration of the above basic requirements in numerous places hence my view is that liberal democracies will eventually only be democracies in name only in the future unless we find a way of fixing the information sources so that people can agree on the facts voting is made easier and people understand their civic duty remove corruption from politics,0,cmv liberal democracies are decaying into illiberal democracies or democracies in name only for a democracy to thrive it needs the following among others a population that agrees on facts therefore channels of information e g podcasts social media and traditional media need to be able to distribute fair and accurate information to the public a population that is informed of their civic duty and is willing to honor them this means that political participation should be enabled as much as possible e g by making voting as easy as possible but most importantly by making education much more than just preparation for a job but more about how to function as a participant in a society where democracy is the political system a political system that is not corrupted by money and special interests i e shouldn t be allowed to buy votes or pay donate to politicians to pass favorable legislation around the world all of the above points are being undermined for example in the eu one of the vice presidents of the eu parliament was arrested for accepting bribes from qatar see here there are many examples of the lack or deterioration of the above basic requirements in numerous places hence my view is that liberal democracies will eventually only be democracies in name only in the future unless we find a way of fixing the information sources so that people can agree on the facts voting is made easier and people understand their civic duty remove corruption from politics
1j2iuum,CMV: Liberals/centrists who down play the severity of the current political crisis are deluding themselves.,"I hear a lot of people say things along the lines of ""they wouldn't dare take away voting rights"" or ""public lands won't be sold off. It's too complicated and too many laws are in place"". I believe this is a complete and total delusion about the intent, ambition, and capabilities of the Trump administration.

They want to destroy the system and be in power for as long as they possibly can. Voting rights and many other things are a direct threat to their ability to remain in power and shape society to their views. Of course they will try to manipulate and remove voting rights from as many of the ""wrong people"" as they can.

They do not care about laws. Every branch of government has already been complicit in the whole sale violation of law at every level. There is some resistance but it's barely slowing them down. Even if a judge or banding together of workers mitigates the capabilities of this administration in one area they will just come from ten other directions with the same intent and ambition.

No right or law or norm or public good is safe. Anyone that believes differently is delusional.

It got [screenshotted, and he quote tweeted it](https://x.com/jules_su/status/1821271151747711219) trying to get just one person to give him a straightforward answer to the question of ""How do we stop the genocide?""

People in the replies threw insults, gave vague references to ""direct action"" and donating to causes, but he pointed out to all of them that they either

A) Had no plan

B) Their ""plan"" does not do anything to stop the genocide.

18cacyg,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,"I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating.",wettigingss,403,0.5600000023841858,2949,1701886825,2023-12-06

1ma77mb,CMV: Hamas stealing aid is NOT a valid excuse for a blockage,"Hi, the #1 reason being thrown around for Israel's inhumane aid blockage is that Hamas steals the aid and sells it at very high prices. I don't think that's true, but let's assume it is.

If they are, so what? Israel is clearly dominating this ""war"" and destroying Hamas on all fronts, Hamas pretty much stands no chance and is fighting for survival now. Israel is much more funded and powerful than Hamas could ever be. How could this money they generate from selling food even fund them further? They can't get more weapons into Gaza, what's wrong with ""giving Hamas money"" if Israel plans on killing every Hamas member anyways?

I don't see how Hamas getting more money could skew this ""war"" towards them in any way possible - it's just a bullshit excuse Israel is using to starve Palestinians.

A lot of the birth process (why design people so that they poop themselves and often rip from their v to their a?)

Rabies

Dementia

True, some if these things are more common because of human intervention, but we only play a part.

I imagine a possible counter argument might be that people get stronger from encountering adversity. Except that they don't always.  Sometimes people die, and sometimes people are left in so much pain that they never recover.

I also imagine that some people might say people have these things happen to them because they deserve it.

18nnyyd,"CMV: ""Slippery slope"" is a perfectly valid argument to use.","Let me use drug addiction as an example.

Many ex-alcoholics refuse to touch a drop of alcohol again for the rest of their lives. There's a reason - even a single drink could push them on the path to relapse and then before they know it, they're a full-blown alcoholic again. In other words, they use a slippery-slope argument when telling friends and family why they must refuse any and all drinks, not even ""just a sip.""

Same with ex-smokers. Many ex-smokers cannot smoke again, not even just a single cigarette, because doing so could push them all the way towards total relapse again. Same with many illegal drugs, or an ex-gambler gambling even ""just one time."" They invoke the slippery-slope argument.

In business, politics, warfare or relationships (especially abusive or potentially-abusive relationships,) there are many times when one cannot yield an inch, lest the other person take a mile. That is also a slippery-slope argument.

1ikq3cq,CMV: It feels like conservatives aren't really against censorship,"Many conservatives claim to be strong defenders of free speech, constantly criticizing censorship, cancel culture, and government overreach. But I’ve noticed a pattern where some of the same people who fight against censorship are fine with suppressing speech when it suits their agenda.

Many conservatives praised Elon Musk for taking over Twitter, saying he would restore free speech. But under his leadership, Twitter has banned journalists who criticized him, suspended accounts tracking his private jet, and suppressed posts from political opponents.

If it was wrong for Twitter to censor conservatives before, why is it okay now?

Some conservatives argue that businesses should be free from government interference. But in states like Tennessee and Florida, they’ve pushed for laws restricting drag performances and LGBT content, even in private businesses.

If conservatives oppose government control over businesses, why support laws dictating what people can perform or express?

Conservatives often defend companies rights when it comes to political donations or free market decisions. But when companies take stances they don’t like, such as Disney opposing Florida ""Don’t Say Gay"" bill, suddenly they advocate for government retaliation.

If businesses should be free to support conservative causes, shouldn’t they also be free to support progressive ones?",No_Discussion6913,1031,0.8199999928474426,747,1739029456,2025-02-08 09:44:16,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ikq3cq/cmv_it_feels_like_conservatives_arent_really/,2,2025,0.09309703533530249,0.17902567794576435,0.13606135664053343,cmv it feels like conservatives aren t really against censorship,many conservatives claim to be strong defenders of free speech constantly criticizing censorship cancel culture and government overreach but i ve noticed a pattern where some of the same people who fight against censorship are fine with suppressing speech when it suits their agenda many conservatives praised elon musk for taking over twitter saying he would restore free speech but under his leadership twitter has banned journalists who criticized him suspended accounts tracking his private jet and suppressed posts from political opponents if it was wrong for twitter to censor conservatives before why is it okay now some conservatives argue that businesses should be free from government interference but in states like tennessee and florida they ve pushed for laws restricting drag performances and lgbt content even in private businesses if conservatives oppose government control over businesses why support laws dictating what people can perform or express conservatives often defend companies rights when it comes to political donations or free market decisions but when companies take stances they don t like such as disney opposing florida don t say gay bill suddenly they advocate for government retaliation if businesses should be free to support conservative causes shouldn t they also be free to support progressive ones,0,cmv it feels like conservatives aren t really against censorship many conservatives claim to be strong defenders of free speech constantly criticizing censorship cancel culture and government overreach but i ve noticed a pattern where some of the same people who fight against censorship are fine with suppressing speech when it suits their agenda many conservatives praised elon musk for taking over twitter saying he would restore free speech but under his leadership twitter has banned journalists who criticized him suspended accounts tracking his private jet and suppressed posts from political opponents if it was wrong for twitter to censor conservatives before why is it okay now some conservatives argue that businesses should be free from government interference but in states like tennessee and florida they ve pushed for laws restricting drag performances and lgbt content even in private businesses if conservatives oppose government control over businesses why support laws dictating what people can perform or express conservatives often defend companies rights when it comes to political donations or free market decisions but when companies take stances they don t like such as disney opposing florida don t say gay bill suddenly they advocate for government retaliation if businesses should be free to support conservative causes shouldn t they also be free to support progressive ones

17ugk46,CMV: The majority of people who think the economy is doing poorly dont understand inflation and the process of getting it under control and instead think they would be better off in a recession,"A large percentage of people currently believe that Biden is doing terrible on the economy, largely due to inflation and difficulty affording things. I think that is entirely because they do not have an understanding of what inflation actually is and dont realize that this is, in fact, the ideal scenario. 

When Biden was inaugurated, inflation was at 7.7% and is currently down to 3.7%. While still elevated, this is a remarkable improvement and the fact that we are slowly approaching the ideal rate of 2% without entering a recession and having people continued to be employed is remarkable. I think, what people dont understand, is that inflation is cumulative and the numbers will never go back down without major things happening and I would like to use the example of food to illustrate this. There are two things that will cause the price of food to largely return to where it was, either a technological breakthrough that doubles yields (not happening) or, the more likely scenario, a drastic decrease in demand because people are out of work and are no longer able to afford anything because the economy is in a recession. I think this later scenario is what many are naively arguing for! 

In addition, I dont think they really understood the 3 paths that we were facing at that time. The first path was runaway inflation, second path was slowly decreasing the inflation rate to 2%, and the third path was entering into a recession. I think we are currently on this middle path and seem to be doing it really well, but if you look at posts all over reddit, people will say, ""the economy isnt doing great, I can barely afford my rent and groceries when I used to be able to"". I am not saying that isnt true, but they dont realize that that is the goal. Would they rather we have entered into runaway inflation? Would they rather have lost their job and not be able to afford rent at all but at least the rent in their area hasnt increased?

1eox0xr,"CMV: The 2024 election will be quite similar to the 2016 election, just with the roles reversed.","If you look at it: For the first time in Trump's political career, he's had to put up with an opponent who draws comparable amounts of enthusiasm as him and one who's stolen much of his media thunder. I honestly don't think Trump knows what to do and I'm not convinced he'll figure it out before the election. What is funny, is that other Republican candidates had an idea that this would happen and yet Trump seems to have been caught completely and utterly off guard by Biden deciding to pass the torch. I won't deny there is always time for Trump to turn it around, but based on what's gone on so far it's not looking good, and we haven't even gotten to the DNC yet. I believe Harris will win every state Biden won in 2020, as well as North Carolina and will make Trump uncomfortable in Texas, Florida and Ohio. I also believe she'll carry Democrats over the finish line in both the Senate and the House. The reason I say this is similar to the 2016 election is because this election comes at a time of uncertainty. Trump represents what Clinton represented in 2016. A product of a political system that most Americans think needs washing. Harris now is what Trump was in 2016. This isn't like 2020 where Democrats were of course happy to vote Biden in but weren't all that enthused about him. Democrats are fired up for Harris this time around and I really do not know if there's much Trump can do to stop or try to counter it.

1j16piq,CMV: The US should be considered an adversary and it’s a security risk to have their forces in Europe,"From the UK, it’s clear that the USA isn’t just no longer an ally - they are an adversary, siding with our enemy, Russia. Look at Greenland. Look at the tariffs. And now the horrible Zelensky meeting.

We share intelligence with the USA. They have troops all over Europe. With Trump, Putin, Vance, Bannon and the Project 2025 fascists in charge - and presumably finding ways to stay in power indefinitely - the USA is now permanently one of the bad guys.

1cbrfoe,"CMV: American Jews on the Left are expected to tolerate a level of blatant antisemitism from POC, both personally and more broadly, that would be inconceivable if roles were reversed. ","The blunt truth about it is, American Jews are more concerned with appearing racist then black or Latino Americans are with being antisemitic. Or, if they do think it’s antisemitic they think it takes a backseat to their own struggles against discrimination. Because — most of them — are white. If they think about it at all. It may be no less conscious then something you grow up around hearing. 

This isn’t to say that there isn’t *lots* of work to do in the “white” community still when it comes to race relations *and* antisemitism or that this discrimination cancels out the other, it’s just to say that this is a real problem in the black community. While they were never ever representative of a majority of black Americans, the Nation of Islam was and continues to be an influential part of African America life, especially in cities. 

And if you agree protocols of the elders of Zion is antisemitic book, then you’d agree that an organization that takes its cues on the topic of Jews from such a antisemitic book would likely be, by extension antisemitic. Well early NOI was very much such an organization. And if that organization had deep roots in certain segments of black America it would probably be somewhat worthwhile to consider its effects.  

All this to say, there’s a reason Kanye West — who coincidentally also defended Louis Farrakhan from correct accusations of antisemitism — is still embraced by hip-hop fans and rappers today and if anything seems to be making a comeback of sorts.

Not that me saying this really matters. The people whose opinion this would change don’t read this and they’d only listen to people they respect within their local community. But it does look, to the outside viewer at least, that there’s a lack of reciprocity. 

During the George Floyd protests the arguments for taking to the streets to demand justice and reform society o prevent antiblack racism from killing more Americans or destroying more lives, were rooted in appeals to fundamental appeals to human rights to God. You can’t use that as a cudgel to motivate and shame people into action then turn around and ignore it or say “why they gotta drag black people into it”. Especially when it’s your fellow countrymen.

1e2aujx,"CMV: I think having women wear a hijab/Niqab/Burka/Etc is sexist, and people defending it for reasons other than religious is illogical","My main gripe with the subject is not over the religious aspect, but rather people defending it as one of ""them cultural things"" Just because something is a part of a culture it doesn't mean it gets a free pass to do anything or makes it right. Black slavery was part of the culture of the time, and it was not right, and I think we can all agree on that. This is something that silently bothers me so I would like to hear the other side to see if I can understand it. If it's religious I could understand it, even when I'm not religious myself, because from a religious person's perspective, it is the indisputable word of God and cannot be doubted.

The argument I see the most often is that some women choose to wear the hijab, I'm obviously not talking about these cases, please refrain from bringing this up. 

I find the idea that women should cover themselves in restrictive clothing in order to ""protect themselves from lewd gazes and abuse"" ridiculous and kinda like victim blaming, why is the victim forced to forfeit her liberties instead of the abuser learning to not...abuse. And yeah I understand the Quran is also sexist with men, but then again, it doesnt make it right.

""It helps control how sexualized women are, and keeps beauty standards down to earth"" Again, the victim shouldnt change for the abuser's sake, and if the natural standard is men so lustful they can't see a woman's hair, I prefer sexualizing women.

""It's like women being required to wear a bra"" It totally isn't. Women, at least currently, \*choose\* to wear a bra for comfort, and sometimes even to make their breasts look better. And wearing a bra is not mandatory.

""It's the same as having to cover your genitals in public"" No, there is a biological imperative, mating instincts, that makes us specially attracted to genitals, also our primary genitals are not only for reproducing but also for excreting, so it's also considered unhygienic. And it can be disruptive.

""You just think that way because of traditional western values"" Yes, yes I do. I don't agree with with everything in traditional western values, but generally I do, and that does not, in any way, affect the validity of an argument, I stand by what I believe because I see logic in it, not because the TV or my parents told me to. And it's why I'm eager to hear the logic in the counter-argument to update my own.

1mpcsa3,CMV: Not liking ghetto/ratchet culture is not the same thing as being racist or classist,"I come from an area of NY that is pretty damn mixed. I have multiple interracial (white/black and white/latino) marriages within my family, and to this day my absolute best friends are a very mixed group. So I don’t wanna hear the I’m racist nonsense meant to shut down a conversation rather than engage in it

I absolutely despise this proud to be ghetto, unashamedly ratchet in public, Idgaf attitude in today’s culture that, unfortunately from what I see, seems to be widespread in black communities. I think it does so much harm to those communities to embrace it and does not help race relations in the slightest


People will say it’s a poverty issue. I’m sorry, I flat out reject that. You don’t need money to act in a respectful manner. You don’t have to be the most educated person to move throughout the world with a sense of modesty and politeness. Rich people can act trashy as well. It’s a culture thing above all else

Whenever I bring this up I just get with “you’re racist”… meanwhile I’m absolutely infatuated and have  tremendous respect for Jim Crow era black America. The fact that they endured so much injustice while remaining godly, intact family units, well educated, and contributed so much to the arts ( fuck yeah blues music), it just makes me sad to see what is happening the last few decades

 I personally blame the media and the glorification of hustle rappers glorifying the lifestyle. That’s who they are shown, that’s the role model image for too many and parents are failing these kids by either taking part in themselves or not doing enough to curb it

I’m ready for the hate but I think this is a real problem I hope to see black community leaders work hard against

183wtc2,"CMV: Female superheroes are ‘failing’ because they have no character arc, not because of PC culture","Seen a few posts on this topic recently, and I disagree with all of them. 

The reason female superhero movies are doing less successfully is primarily because their character arcs deviate from that of the standard superhero. The standard superhero starts off as weak person with low status in society (or a rich playboy with pain on the inside), acquires powers in a freak accident, goes through formative trials that test their abilities and their values, and then hones both of these just in time to fight the main villain. Female superheroes don’t have this same character arc: they start off every movie all powerful, like a literal invincible god. Their character arc tends to be, really, I don’t know, nothing… In essence, every single female superhero is Superman, except without kryptonite or Lois Lane. 

Take Wonder Woman for example. She starts off as a literal Amazon Goddess. Her only character arc is that she has to be taught by a man how to function in human society (sarcasm to point out that it was actually kind of a sexist movie). 

Take Captain Marvel for example. The most powerful Avenger who literally couldn’t be involved in all the movies or she’d break the story. She started off her first movie all powerful, just minus her memory… I’ll leave out for spoilers. Needless to say, she doesn’t really have significant personal growth, or growth in her powers. Wonder why her second movie bombed so hard.

Why can’t they just treat a female superhero like the first Spider-Man? Nerdy person gets superpowers, gets confidence, gets love interest and fights bad people? Is it maybe because the directors themselves are sexist and think people won’t take a female superhero seriously unless they make them incredibly powerful?

It’s not the fact that people don’t want to see a woman beat up men. People love superhero movies.

If they want to talk about it, they will. It is not a cancellable offence to not use your platform to talk politics if your platform isn't focused on politics.

1jvw9br,CMV: If Trump engaged in insider trading that’s bad.,"Trump’s recent decisions to apply massive tariffs and then suddenly remove the tariffs caused huge swings in the stock market. Anyone with knowledge of the trade policies before they were enacted could make wild sums of money by buying stock market positions that predict how the market will react to the new policy. If Trump or his staff participated in insider trading, it would be corrupt and unethical.

The president of the United States holds one of the most powerful and influential positions in the world. With access to vast amounts of sensitive information and the ability to influence financial markets through policy decisions, the president is expected to uphold the highest ethical standards. If the president were to engage in insider trading—the practice of trading stocks or other securities based on non-public, material information you are entrusted not to use to your personal benefit—it would have severe consequences for the country’s integrity, economy, and public trust in government.

First and foremost, insider trading by the president would represent a gross abuse of power. The office of the president is entrusted with confidential information that, if used improperly, could unfairly benefit individuals or groups financially. Using that information for personal gain would be a betrayal of public trust and a violation of the duty to serve the nation’s interests above one’s own. The president is supposed to be a role model for lawful and ethical behavior. If the highest leader in the country engages in illegal financial activity, it sets a dangerous precedent for others in government and beyond.

Moreover, insider trading undermines the fairness and stability of financial markets. The stock market functions best when all participants have equal access to information. When someone, especially someone as powerful as the president, uses confidential knowledge to make financial decisions, it creates an uneven playing field. This can erode investor confidence and deter people from participating in the market, ultimately harming the economy.

Another major concern is the potential for corruption and manipulation. If a president benefits from insider trading, there may be a temptation to shape policies not based on the public good, but on what would increase personal wealth. For instance, the president could delay or push legislation in a way that benefits certain companies or industries they have investments in. This would erode democratic principles and lead to governance driven by profit, not the public’s welfare.

Finally, insider trading by the president would deal a serious blow to public trust in government institutions. Citizens expect transparency, accountability, and fairness from their leaders. If the president is seen as using their position for personal enrichment, it fosters cynicism, apathy, and resentment among the public. This can weaken civic engagement and faith in the democratic process.

Below are a few arguments I’d guess people may make against my claim. I’d be curious if there’s evidence for any of these or any other explanation for believing that it would be okay for Trump to engage in insider trading.

-Insider trading does not hurt anyone.

16ig7al,"cmv: 9 times of 10, “cultural appropriation” is just white people virtue-signaling.","There’s a big difference between appropriation and appreciation, and should be fairly easy to distinguish… unless you yourself lack an appreciation and then can’t tell the difference. 
Wearing another culture’s clothes is not “appropriation” if it’s coming from a place of appreciation… in the same way as eating another culture’s food or listening to another culture’s music isn’t “appropriation”. Appropriation would be to APPROPRIATE another culture’s clothes, food or music, by claiming is as YOUR OWN or making a mockery of it.
Drinking tea is not appropriation, claiming it as British is.
See the difference? If you can’t, I think that says more about you. 

Side note: I have had the fortune to travel to many countries, have often worn the clothes of the country I’m visiting or living in, and NEVER ONCE has anyone from that culture been even close to offended… in fact the reactions I have received have ALWAYS been positive. People around the world are so happy and grateful to see someone celebrate and embrace their culture. The only people who have ever acted “offended” are, and I say it as a white person myself, almost always white people getting offended “on behalf” of another culture. Classic virtue signaling, and also what an insulting position to take. I couldn’t possibly enjoy that culture and therefore must be mocking it? Did appreciation just not occur to you?

1jszk88,CMV: Gen Z has more in common with Boomers than Millennials.,"There’s obviously a difference in values, but in terms of attitude, behavior, and general vibe, Gen Z actually shares more with Boomers than they do with Millennials. Why? Well…

	1.	They’re kind of isolationist.

Gen Z seems more withdrawn. They value alone time and don’t love socializing outside their comfort zone. Which means…

	2.	Neither are great at emotional communication in person.

Gen Z often struggles to express feelings face-to-face. They shut down or avoid important conversations entirely. Kinda Boomer-ish, right? Different reasons, similar result. This creates…

	3.	Rigid belief systems.

Gen Z tends to adopt strong, black-and-white views—much like Boomers clinging to fixed worldviews. There’s less room for nuance or gray areas. Which is why…

	4.	Both love secondhand outrage.

There’s a shared grumpiness. Gen Z gets fired up over stuff that doesn’t affect them directly. Boomers did the same - just with a different set of values. Which brings me to…

	5.	Societal rule enforcement.

Gen Z is big on calling people out for breaking unspoken social rules. Boomers loved rules too - just old-school ones. And this really shows up on social media, because guess what, both are…

	6.	Chronically online

Boomers are Facebook addicts, Gen Z are TikTok addicts. Different platforms, same result: constant outrage and a worldview shaped by the algorithm. But the pièce de résistance…

	7.	Both think Millennials are cringey.

Boomers and Gen Z hate looking stupid. Millennials didn’t have that luxury - they grew up online, testing boundaries to figure out what was “too far.” Gen Z is way more self-aware and peer-policed, so they play it safe. Boomers just call this “dignity.”

I’m obviously not saying all Gen Z or Boomers as individuals are the same. But taking the tropes, clichés, and general vibe you get from each generation… if you strip away the aesthetics and politics, Gen Z sometimes feels like Boomer 2.0. Just younger, sassier and with better skincare routines.

1fuof4o,"CMV: Piracy isn't immoral, Nor is the damage from it as big as people make it out to be.","- ""If buying isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing.""

We've all heard this phrase countless times, and that's what i wanna dive into here. Companies have been and continue to get greedier by the second, and they've started to completely disregard people's conditions when it comes to acquiring a product. Streaming services deliberately serve you ads on their lower tier subscriptions in order to get you to upgrade (giving ads to paying customers is ridiculous), certain game stores have shit regional pricing or don't have it at all, game companies continue to include DRM software that damages the experience of the paying customers (cough cough, denuvo) and completely fucks up the experience of paying customers. Let's not even get into Nintendo and their abuse of the copyright system, i'll leave it for another post.

Not only is piracy these days not immoral, its actually the only way some people can acquire something they want to consume because they don't have a choice. So one could argue it ends up reaching people that would've otherwise just not consumed the product: You're not getting someone who can't buy a product to buy a product. But through pirating it they may become a potential customer. But lets digress a little.

So you, yeah, the person reading the post. Lets say you wanted to buy a game. Perhaps you'd use an online game store like epic games or steam, right? Now you own the game, and you can play it. Simple and convenient right? Except you don't own the game. If you, for any reason, get banned from the platform or lose access to your account you'll end up with either one of two things: an excruciating headache from trying to get it back or no games at all. Oh, you say you're a paying customer and you acquired everything legally? Sucks to be you! (You're also subject to the service's longevity, ToS changes, bugs, online authentication, bullshit DRM integration... I mean at least take me out to dinner before you f-- me like that-)

...Nah, for real though. The difference between getting games these days and lets say, 20 years ago, is that you actually owned the game physically. Unless you were using your CDs to cut bananas or something, you just need the game console and the CD. Nowadays you basically need to have everything online and completely depend on the company and be subject to their online authentication for various games before you can actually play them. Again, making the life of paying customers harder for no reason. 

If these companies are extremely rich and they keep buying out or getting rid of competition (cough cough nintendo), keep flipping the bird to the customers and push us to do exactly what they want once they've monopolized the market, how is piracy immoral? Doing anything about injustices legally will get you slapped around by big time lawyers and legal fees, so it is quite literally the only way that we have to rebel against these companies and make them change the way they behave. Your support ticket #2131321 is not changing shit, but speaking with your wallet surely will, especially if more people do it. Piracy isn't immoral, and it is purely a service issue. Its born out of the greed of streaming services and game companies. I guarantee it'd drop by an astounding 99% if they were to just fix the fucking way they operate, but they refuse to. So i say, sail the high seas and find that One Piece! Okay i need to stop... but anyways, change my view if there's something im missing here.

1klk21c,CMV: USA taking in white South African refugees is racist in the context of Trump’s immigration policies,"At the start of his Presidency, Trump halted all refugee admissions to the U.S. However, he has since made an exception for white South Africans, specifically Afrikaners, citing “racial discrimination” and violence against white farmers following South Africa’s 2024 land reform law.

I’m unconvinced that white South Africans are the only group in the world that needs asylum in the USA.

My definition of racism is discrimination against people based on their ethnic or racial background.

17m51d2,CMV: Parents should be required to be present in the room and watch the whole procedure while their child is being circumcised.,"At least in North America,  parents usually stay out of the procedure room while their child is being circumcised. I believe if parents would have to stomach watching their child getting mutilated fewer people would want to do it and it would fall out of favor.

Aside from clinically indicated cases, circumcision is a barbaric and unnecessary practice based on distorted perceptions stemmed from religion or social norms.

The prepuce (foreskin) is a normal part of the body that protects the very sensitive glans of the penis. Unless there is a clinical indication for amputating a normal part of the body, it is mutilation. 

Circumcision is also a violation of four basic human rights:
- the convention against torture 
- the convention of the rights of the child
- the universal declaration of human rights
- and the international covenant on civil and political rights.",zerokids2023,525,0.6899999976158142,885,1698936133,2023-11-02 09:42:13,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17m51d2/cmv_parents_should_be_required_to_be_present_in/,11,2023,0.037742041352149654,0.21214302855771539,0.12494253495493252,cmv parents should be required to be present in the room and watch the whole procedure while their child is being circumcised,at least in north america parents usually stay out of the procedure room while their child is being circumcised i believe if parents would have to stomach watching their child getting mutilated fewer people would want to do it and it would fall out of favor aside from clinically indicated cases circumcision is a barbaric and unnecessary practice based on distorted perceptions stemmed from religion or social norms the prepuce foreskin is a normal part of the body that protects the very sensitive glans of the penis unless there is a clinical indication for amputating a normal part of the body it is mutilation circumcision is also a violation of four basic human rights the convention against torture the convention of the rights of the child the universal declaration of human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights,0,cmv parents should be required to be present in the room and watch the whole procedure while their child is being circumcised at least in north america parents usually stay out of the procedure room while their child is being circumcised i believe if parents would have to stomach watching their child getting mutilated fewer people would want to do it and it would fall out of favor aside from clinically indicated cases circumcision is a barbaric and unnecessary practice based on distorted perceptions stemmed from religion or social norms the prepuce foreskin is a normal part of the body that protects the very sensitive glans of the penis unless there is a clinical indication for amputating a normal part of the body it is mutilation circumcision is also a violation of four basic human rights the convention against torture the convention of the rights of the child the universal declaration of human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights
1h7kro3,CMV: Paywalls are destroying the web and fueling misinformation.,"Look, I get it—publications need money to survive. Journalists and fact-checkers don’t come cheap, and investigative reporting is a valuable service that deserves compensation. But I feel like we’ve reached a breaking point with paywalls. Everywhere I turn, from reputable newspapers to specialized journals, I can’t read more than a paragraph without being hit by a pop-up that demands I pay $12 a month for [Random Publication Here].

I’m not inherently against the idea of supporting quality journalism, but the way it’s currently done seems to be pushing people away. There’s no shortage of nonsense on the web that’s completely free of paywalls. Bad information fueled by shock value and conspiracy theories never costs a dime. Meanwhile, good information from credible sources sits behind a locked gate. Every time I open an article only to have my scrolling abruptly interrupted by a paywall, I’m tempted to just chuck my phone across the room.

We wonder why people have such distorted worldviews, but can we really be surprised? When factual, well-researched reporting is locked behind a paywall, and the first page of search results is littered with free, sensationalized content, what do we think people will gravitate toward? It’s a no-brainer: they’ll go for what’s accessible, even if it’s garbage. And when that’s what people read day in and day out, it inevitably shapes their perspective on reality.

I’m tired of this cycle. I’m tired of feeling like the best information is hidden away, and that I’m being forced into the arms of social media’s algorithm-driven content. Paywalls might make financial sense for news organizations, but I feel they’re hurting the public’s overall understanding of the world.

1d90fx9,CMV: Arabs never criticize other Arab countries. However when it comes to Israel it's the polar opposite.,"First off I'm not posting this to shill an agenda in favor of anyone, I will try to be as apolitical as possible.

As someone who has a North African heritage. Most of my family members hold strong grudges against Israel. But I didn't see any signs of grievance or complaints when other Arab leaders/countries do some sorts of violations. And it's not just my family plenty of Arabs in the Arab world keep their mouth shut when it's another Arab but when it's Israel it's the complete opposite.

Just for context, here's a list of violations and mistreatment Arab countries have done:

\- Al-Assad regime killing his own civilians during the civil war and the casualty count trample the one seen in Gaza. The regime literally used chemical weapons against its own citizens.

\- The Saddam regime in 1). Invading Iran (with the help of the west) in a brutal war where some wild warfare practices were used. 2). Invading Kuwait. 3) Repressing his own citizens and especially Shi'ites and Kurds minorities (Yes I know that Iranians and Kurds in other countries protested Saddam) but the Sunni's in other Arab countries just kept silent.

\- Speaking of Kuwait? How many of you knew that there are actually people indigenous to Kuwait and the government refuse to grant citizenship to. [The bedoon of Kuwait as documented here](https://bit.ly/3yHhhbh). Why don't Arabs protest for their self-determination like they do for Palestinians?

\- The countless Human Rights violations in the Gulf countries starting from the Kafala system (that Qatar rightly abolished after plenty of FOREIGN complaints) to the numerous inequalities women face. I can go on forever here

\- The war in Yemen that caused the biggest massive humanitarian crisis and was instigated by both Saudi Arabia and Iran, again no massive protests was seen in the Arab world to reach a ceasefire.

It seems to me that the only consistent thing here is that when the aggressor is not Arab/Muslim the protests are massively launched, even though Arabs have violated themselves to an arguably greater degree.

Another thing noticed inside the Arab discourse is that the holocaust existence is taken with suspicion and never embraced, same with the Armenian Genocide. Compare this with the war in Gaza where in most mainstream discourse it is referred as an unfettered genocide in Gaza.

Tell me in one instance a sizeable group of Arabs disapproved another Arab country/leader for a particular violation. I'm not talking about government officials, I will change my view if this instance pertained considerable members from society.",holamifuturo,442,0.6600000262260437,337,1717620454,2024-06-05

17277c9,"cmv: The US population of foreign born people, regardless of legal status, has fluctuated between 5 and 15% for over a century. The current so called “crisis” is a bigoted myth.","We have always had a thriving community of foreign born people here in the US, which has fluctuated for the last century between 5 and 15% of the over all population.

https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/immigrant-population-over-time

This current so called “crisis” myth is also nothing new. There has always been a vocal segment of the US who blame immigrants for every single social challenge from the economy to drugs and crime. 

For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime.

https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/mythical-tie-between-immigration-and-crime

I lived in a border community for 12years that had upwards of 80% Spanish speaking immigrants of every sort of legal status. They are no different than any other segment of the US.

The current “crisis” in the US is born of nothing less than thinly varnished bigotry.

Furthermore large segments of the US economy are utterly dependent on immigrant labor to perform work that Americans simply will not do. We’re we to actually enforce the current prohibitions we have on the books the results would be catastrophic.

16f3ker,CMV: Writing a letter to a judge as a character reference does not imply you don't believe someone did the bad thing they were convicted of,"This is spurred by the backlash to Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis writing letters as a character reference for Danny Masterson, but it can be applied to many things. 

People convicted of many crimes have others write character references to the judge prior to sentencing, and I don't believe that when that happens they necessarily think the person is innocent.  They are speaking to how they know them outside of the crime committed.  All this is so the judge can get a better picture of the person outside of the crime they have been convicted of and that can influence sentencing.   But at no point is that saying the person is innocent. 

I feel like a lot of the flak Ashton and Mila received is a bit unfair.   They were asked to do this as people who have known him for 20+ years.  They could have said no of course, but he was already going to jail for some period of time.   It didn't say he was innocent.  It didn't say they didn't believe the women who accused him.  All it said was that ""this is the person I know and this is what he did for me"".  

If you feel that these character references have no place in the justice system, that is fine.  But I think being upset that people write them at the request of lawyers is a bit much. 

I also feel that many people would do the same for someone they have known for 20+ years, and people are being a bit hypocritical.

1cvoqzc,"CMV: Saying someone ""committed suicide"" is fine","Over the last couple years, especially from people I know in mental health, there has been an effort to change language around suicide to use the phrase ""die by suicide"" instead of ""commit suicide"" and while I think ""die by suicide already sounds kind of off because speaking in passive voice sounds like it is removing agency from the individual, I also have problems with the main argument for the switch that I've seen.

The argument is that committing suicide sounds like they're doing something wrong. Since you commit crimes and historically suicide, or attempts to do so were illegal.

But we don't just use ""commit"" as a crime. It's also just means to pledge, or just carry out. You commit resources. You commit to a relationship. You commit energy.

1eaehhe,cmv: The recent commentary that Kamala Harris becoming the democratic nominee through stepping down rather than through primary are disingenuous.,"When I voted for Joe Biden in the democratic primary, I did so understanding that if elected and unable to carry out the duties of being the president, he would immediately be replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris without any kind of vote.

If Joe Biden were to pass away, Vice President Harris would immediately replace him right now. If Joe Biden were to pass away 10 seconds after the election was certified, the Vice President, who at this point, Joe Biden has intended to be Kamala Harris, would replace him. If Joe Biden were not the incumbent, and Kamala Harris was not already the Vice Presidential candidate, there would be an argument because there would be no clear line of succession, but there is in this case.

1hzwscm,CMV: American capitalism is severely flawed and exploitation of the working class is inherent to becoming a billionaire,"Throughout history, it has been evident that the capitalist economic philosophy of profit above all else, little/no government regulation, and letting the uber-rich hoard their incomprehensibly large amount of wealth is a leech on the well-being of society as a whole and leads to a constantly growing wealth divide not only within the scale of country, but on a global scale as well; a very clear divide between ""developed"" and ""less developed"" countries.

I can understand the philosophy behind the free market, having absolute equal distribution of wealth between everyone is ridiculous and creates stagnation in the development of a country. However, an unchecked wealth gap between the working and corporate/wealthy class creates turmoil and division amongst the people of a country. Throughout history, we can see that the uber-wealthy tend to use hatred against fellow people to distract the working class from who is really exploiting them; a scapegoat if you will. 

We can see in current day America that Donald Trump, a billionaire who is also endorsed by (and essentially a partner to) Elon Musk, the richest man on the planet, uses Mexican immigrants as a scapegoat for all the working man's troubles, Grocery prices, gas prices, inflation, etc, while creating tax cuts for the uber wealthy and killing welfare programs and departments, including the Department of Education. Despite the fact that deporting 10 million Mexican immigrants would cripple the American economy, the common working class white American believes it, simply because they are of a different culture and it is very easy to believe that they are the enemy because of human psychology.

The wealthy benefit from this because a working class that is too busy hating eachother is a working class that wont develop class consciousness. The billionaires will still cut corners at their companies and lobby to keep minimum wages stagnant as inflation slowly chips away at the value of the dollar, all while they grow wealthier. 

The unimaginable hoarding of wealth we see in the billionaire class is a cause for most of the economic troubles. There is no justification for one man to own as much wealth as millions of people while there are people who cant eat or drink. To be a billionaire, you must have exploitation at some point along the chain among at least one of their income streams, mainly their companies. Jeff Bezos is a prime example, a man acclaimed to have made his wealth ""by himself"", yet Amazon is notoriously one of the worst workplaces in the entire country for worker who make pennies to Bezos' millions.

I don't call for a total communist revolution within America, I just think that no person should have a billion dollars of wealth to their name no matter what they do as there's no reasonable justification for it that doesn't involve leeching off the working class.

1hvpmcx,"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media","As far as I understand, the US Congress is trying to ban TikTok because they believe that a big Chinese-owned social media site/app is dangerous because the Chinese government might use it to spy on Americans and push propaganda to them.

I am not trying to be pro-China nor anti-China, but it is undeniable that the political relations between the USA and China are not great, and they are likely to get worse under the new Trump regime. Hence it is within the realm of reason for Americans to be be wary of Chinese agendas. (Again, I do not mean to be anti-Chinese.)

However, in my opinion, all the arguments I have heard about Chinese social media also apply to American social media. From my perspective as a European, the USA is a foreign power led by a dangerously unpredictable right-wing extremist. Elon Musk (who controls Twitter) is a close Trump-supporter, and as far as I can tell Mark Zuckerberg (who controls Facebook) also supports Trump. I don't know about the owners of other major social media such as YouTube or Reddit, but I do not trust any of these people. Any of these might ally with Trump and use their platforms to spread propaganda to support a Trumpist ideology. That could cause a lot of damage to my country and others.

If Chinese-owned social media are dangerous, then American-owned social media are just as dangerous. Especially under Trump, but also without Trump.

194cjhp,CMV: Conservatism is just delaying inevitable change,"I mean this with as most respect as I can give, and I’m genuinely looking for someone to change my view because maybe I’m oversimplifying things.

I’ve gotten more and more into politics each year and I’ve found that I lean more with left-wing ideas. But I don’t really understand conservatism especially from a historic perspective.

When I say that I mean I feel like we’re in this cycle where a controversial issue comes up, the left takes a position, the right takes the opposing view, time flies, legislation changes favoring the left, more time flies, we understand this as a social norm now, new issue comes up, the right completely disassociates from that last issue. I think the most recent one is gay marriage but, suffrage for virtually every group, climate change, social security and basically every hit button issue of the past i feel like are in the same boat. 

I say this not to insult, rather to learn more about the other side. Because as I am left leaning I don’t really abide by political tribalism. If someone can explain or enlighten me, I’d genuinely appreciate it.

Again, sorry if I come off as aggressive or abrasive.

1mfxy10,CMV: Islamophobia has made it impossible to criticize Islam in a normal & non-bigoted way.,"I’m taking specifically about the West. 

Right wingers want all Muslims to die and leftists don’t accept any kind of critique against Islam in general. You tell someone on the right that you’re not a huge fan of Islam’s apostasy laws and they’ll tell you with a straight face that they’re all terrorists. You tell someone on the left that some of Islam’s laws on warfare (like the one about prisoners of war) are morally questionable, and they’ll try to shift the conversation to Christianity, criticism against which they’ll readily accept and talk at great lengths.

Christianity in the West is a great example of a religion we can now criticize in a normal, rational, un-bigoted way in the West. That’s because there’s hardly such a thing called “Christianophobia” in the West, and thank God. In fact I think Christianity is dissected in the West in such a scientific, anthropological way that I think is so fascinating. I think the way everyone regardless of their religious beliefs (or lack thereof, in the majority of cases) felt comfortable tuning in and talking about this year’s Conclave goes to show how normalized rational, non-bigoted discussion and critique of Christianity is in the West. 

Because of Islamophobia, popular discussion about Islam in the West has only ever fallen under two categories: bigotry or blind defense. 

Obviously Islamophobia has caused a surge in irrational hatred and bigotry from the right against Muslims, that we all know, but an unintended consequence of this that people don’t really talk about is how the Western Left seems to have in many ways either blatantly defended the indefensible or become intolerant towards any critiques against Islam to kind of absorb or “balance” all of the hatred coming from the Right.

This leaves very little space for people to interact or engage with Islam in a normal, rational, non-bigoted, non-biased, and non-censored space. I feel like there exists no “centrist” space for a conversation like this, or maybe it’s just that centrists aren’t loud enough about their opinions on Islam as the right and left (I don’t really know if centrists are really loud enough about anything, coming from a leftist). You’re either fully Islamophobic or don’t think Islam’s problems should be discussed whatsoever. 

Like are there normal people who have normal thoughts about Islam? Like there are some pretty good things in there too. Bad stuff as well. Like can we just be normal? Some nasheeds are genuinely so fire. Maybe let’s not advocate for killing Ex-Muslims though. Is it that hard to have a conversation like this? 

TLDR:
Me: Islamic apostasy laws are kinda crazy I’m ngl
Right wingers: That’s why I don’t have any sympathy for the children in Gaza. Israel should finish the job. 
*incorrect buzzer sound*

Me: Islam allowing governments to hold prisoners of war for ransom is lowkey insane 
Leftists: What about Christianity? Let’s talk about Christianity. You’re Islamophobic.
*incorrect buzzer sound*

Me: I think it’s weird that Prophet Mohammed PBUH married all those women.
Hypothetical Centrist that I’ve yet to meet: Me too. He ate when he advocated for the education of women, though. 
Me: Real. Let’s go get shawarma from our local friendly Lebanese restaurant.

There's also a racial aspect to this. With the naacp launching a lawsuit against one school district who kept passing a student, all the way through getting a diploma, while the student was functionally illiterate. The case claimed his civil rights were denied because he was not given an education.

https://edsource.org/2022/the-right-to-read-it-took-a-lawsuit-against-california/678069

Worth noting, students in predominantly white districts are often held to very different standards in the same state. Certain behaviors are tolerated and worse yet, actually getting worse grades is considered passing. This creates two tiers of an education system that's also based on race to a degree. 

But it gets worse. Because these students then come out of high school knowing less, but they go on to college, often going into debt, and then they quit after realizing they're nowhere near the level which it takes to pass a college level course. This sets up these students for even worse prospects in life. Worth noting, this is also why California quietly ended affirmative action admissions years ago  at many state universities. It was having negative repercussions for students of color. 

https://www.npr.org/2023/06/30/1185226895/heres-what-happened-when-affirmative-action-ended-at-california-public-colleges

Students who have learning disabilities or need special help can also request it in this system. It's called an IEP and this allows for accommodations for their disability. So a student can get extra time, or individual tutoring should they fall behind. If they really want to, they're going to pass. 

And this isn't even touching on the grade inflation we've seen on the last couple decades. C level work is now considered A level. Curriculums have been dumbed down to the point where showing up and doing the bare minimum is enough. Well, fsr less than the bare minimum. The numbers themselves are pretty shocking. Whereas it's common for predominantly white school districts to have around 85% on grade level, in many cities across the us this drops to just 25% of black students in cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland. 

https://www.realcleareducation.com/articles/2022/11/24/large_racial_reading_and_math_performance_gaps_persist_as_children_age_110794.html

The answer isn't to continue to just pass everyone with a heartbeat, but have actual repercussions for students. Of course some accommodations should be made and in some instances students should be able to retake certain tests, but overall as it currently stands, there's not much a school will do to a student who is far below grade level, and also having multiple absences.

1c8rxy4,CMV: Polyamory is just a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal.,"Three years ago, my ex partner unilaterally demanded we open our marriage during a trip with friends where I couldn't escape or even have a healthy conversation about it, then threatened to leave if I didn't comply when we came home.   
  
I begged and pleaded, but eventually relented. Then, after a few months I began to explore the literature and rules of polyamory in online support groups and became curious about finding my own relationships outside of our marriage (I realised later that this was mostly to escape the abuse I was still putting up with at home, which had persisted for for years).   
  
When I told my partner that I was also curious to find other people, she exploded in a terrifying rage that I am still struggling to understand. She accused me of just taking advantage of her 'coming out polyamorous first' in our marriage, insisted that I couldn't possibly be polyamorous because I am autistic, and finally demanded I 'prove' to her (somehow) that I ever felt love for another person other than her. 

When I couldn't come up with an example other than the one other crush I had before we began officially dating six years prior, she again threatened to leave, screaming at me for being a misogynist, and all I could do was beg for forgiveness and cry myself to sleep. 

She apologised days later, but halfheartedly and still accused me of being both a misogynist and narcissist who needed therapy and we scheduled couple's therapy together with a poly-friendly therapist. 

Two months later--and four days before our appointment--she cheated on me. 

She came home and confessed while begging for forgiveness in another whirlwind of pain, and again I gave her a pass as I was now terrified of being abandoned--only for her to buy a one-way ticket to Portland the next morning. 

I never saw her again. 

She filed for divorce 1,000 miles away, leaving me with our two cats and a whole heap of debt. I still went to our therapist appointment somehow, but alone. She was incredible. She helped me understand the full extent of the abuse I had been suffering for years and convinced me that polyamory and narcissism often intersect--but don't necessarily have to. 

But it still didn't help, and I checked myself into an emergency outpatient facility after a suicide attempt.

Things stabilised, but I left the country and am now struggling with severe mental illness and barely making ends meet while having to deal with the constant aching pain of having lost my best friend to what still feels like a relationship system defined by 'what you can get out of life'--not on forming a unique, stable, honest, and committed partnership. 

Please help me change my view.

I'm left grappling with deep emotional scars, questioning whether polyamory is inherently flawed or if my experience was an outlier.

I acknowledge that my ex-partner's behaviour was manipulative and abusive, but I'm struggling to reconcile how polyamory could be anything other than a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal. However, I'm open to reconsidering my perspective, as I don't want to let one traumatic experience colour my understanding of an entire relationship dynamic.

I'm seeking insights from the community to challenge my current view. Can anyone provide examples or arguments that showcase healthy and fulfilling polyamorous relationships? How can I separate my ex-partner's toxic behaviour from the broader concept of polyamory?

1kbrkch,CMV: The United States would be a more just and united country today if the Union had imposed draconian punishments on the Confederacy after the Civil War,"This is a follow-up/enhancement to a recent post on this subreddit titled ""CMV: The American Civil War should have ended with mass executions"".  I thought that post was a good start, but I wanted to take the idea even further.  
  
The failure of the Union to decisively dismantle Confederate ideology and power structures after the Civil War was a critical mistake that enabled white supremacist terrorism and regional grievance culture to persist for generations. If the Union had treated the Confederacy as a treasonous insurrection and responded with uncompromising punishment—including executions of leadership, long-term military occupation, land redistribution, and the criminalization of Confederate symbols—then I believe the United States would today be a more socially just, racially equal, and politically united country.

**Context**:  
After the Civil War, the federal government pursued a relatively lenient policy toward the defeated South. Confederate leaders were not executed; many quickly regained political influence. Efforts to protect the rights of freed slaves during Reconstruction were eventually abandoned. This led to the rise of the ""Lost Cause"" mythology, the creation of Jim Crow laws, and racial terror groups like the KKK. Confederate monuments were erected decades later, and even today, states fly Confederate flags and debate whether the Civil War was ""about states' rights.""

I think all of this could have been prevented—or at least severely limited—if the federal government had acted more decisively in the 1860s and 70s.

**My Argument**:

If the Union had enacted a policy of **total dismantling** of the Confederacy—not just in terms of military defeat, but cultural, political, and economic erasure—the following benefits would likely have emerged:

1. **Abolition of Confederate Identity**:
   * Confederate leaders like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee could have been publicly tried and executed for treason.
   * Confederate flags, monuments, and songs could have been banned by federal law.
   * Southern schools and churches would be required to teach a pro-Union, anti-slavery narrative—preventing the Lost Cause myth from ever taking root.
2. **Lasting Protection of Black Civil Rights**:
   * A prolonged military occupation (20–30 years) could have kept Black voters, landowners, and politicians safe.
   * Land formerly owned by slaveholders could have been redistributed to freedmen.
   * A Black political class might have firmly taken root, with long-term representation at all levels of government.
3. **Economic Restructuring**:
   * Plantation landowners could have been dispossessed and barred from regaining political or economic power.
   * Northern industry and capital could have modernized the South with infrastructure and industry under federal control.
   * The region’s economy might have been diversified away from white-dominated agriculture much earlier.
4. **Suppression of White Supremacist Movements**:
   * Early iterations of the KKK and similar groups could have been ruthlessly dismantled by federal troops with legal authority.
   * Sympathy for such groups would be viewed socially and legally as treasonous rather than defensible under ""heritage.""
5. **Long-Term National Unity**:
   * The regional divide that still influences U.S. politics might have faded with a clearer victory and forced ideological realignment.
   * Racial grievance and Southern exceptionalism would be stigmatized and discredited early.

**Anticipated Counterarguments** (feel free to challenge these):

* “That level of punishment would’ve caused long-term insurgency.” → Possibly, but the South was already devastated; firm occupation could have prevented armed uprisings more effectively than leniency did.
* “You can’t force ideological change through punishment.” → Post-WWII Germany and Japan suggest otherwise—firm restructuring paired with education and democratization *can* work.
* “That would’ve been authoritarian and un-American.” → The Confederacy waged war to preserve slavery. The response needed to be just as morally clear and uncompromising.

**Change My View**:  
I'm open to hearing why this path would not have led to a better America. Would it have backfired long-term? Are there moral or practical limits to federal authority, even in the wake of treason? Would another approach have been more effective?

Let me know—I'd especially appreciate well-sourced historical, legal, or ethical arguments.",Vidarr2000,1431,0.8100000023841858,321,1746047590,2025-04-30

1msrc8g,CMV: There is literally nothing Trump could do that would make his supporters denounce him.,"MAGA is in some weird psyop where Trump can literally do no wrong ever, and he's getting more and more batshit crazy every day. He has military in American cities with zero cause, and his supporters are cheering it on. No matter how brainwashed MAGA is, it gets to a point. Like, even if I imagined myself being fed Fox News slop from birth, I still see myself questioning what the Trump admin is doing right now. Maybe when their own lives are ruined, then they'll start backtracking, but even then, they'd probably just pretend they never actually supported Trump and latch onto some other far-right figurehead. Right-wing politics right now is literally just hating the left, no matter what that entails. Denying climate change, pretending vaccines don't work, hating minorities, getting rid of regulations that literally keep us alive, shredding the Constitution to pieces and ignoring the law, allowing the President to literally own a memecoin where he takes in bribes as well as drop his own cologne and phone brand, not to mention the pedophilic sex ring, global blanket tariffs, etc. Dozens of videos of ICE literally abusing legal residents on video, but clearly they don't care about any of that. This doesn't even mention the insane shit Trump has already done years ago, such as January 6th. Not sure what else is supposed to be disqualifying for someone to be President if that isn't. All of this because they hate woke culture or something? I can't even fathom the reason.

17f6fkz,CMV: No one should support Palestine,"There's quite a bit of posts about the conflict but if you're here then you're interested!

Quick note: I am not saying we should not support PalestiNIANS (the people), what they're going through is a horrendous nightmare

Anyway, I want to quickly say what I think I know so that if I'm mistaken it can be pointed out:

- Israel took over most of the surrounding land including what some argue rightfully belong to Palestine, and that this was a long time ago
- This conflict has lasted years and several battles, with the current one being yet another fight for Palestine to take their land back
- However, Israel has tried around 5 times to come to a peaceful agreement (involving the UN at some point) about these lands which have been rejected by Palestine every time
- Lastly, the initiators of today's conflict are literal terrorists

Ok and this is why I hold my view:

- First of all, Palestine begun this conflict (again). Why is anyone supporting the perpetrator of a war that has already caused so much destruction and murder of innocent people
- Also, these were TERRORISTS!!! There's a group in my home country that are similar to Hamas, and if they ever pulled something like this I would never support my country... yet so many support this.
- Israel has had this land for a decently long time, why is Palestine still fighting for it? They're clearly militarily inferior and can't protect it, they should be taking a peace treaty at all costs
- I understand the implications of the land being controlled by Israel (Economic troubles and such) but does this really justify the killing of thousands of innocent people?
- Lastly, it seems Israel is launching a counterattack that to me seems to be fair, they keep getting attacked for the same thing so it's time to shut off Hamas for good. Hamas uses civilians to protect itself while Israel seems to just want to protect its people whatever the cost.

I understand that because of the recent border blockage many Palestenians do not have access to food which is very unjust and horrible to the innocent people, but this has been a common tactic to pressure governments to stop attacks and converse diplomatically or surrender.

That is all, I'm very open to having my view changed on this matter if I'm persuaded. And just in case this is brought up; I am not from either of these countries or their surrounding areas, and I'm also not originally from any of the countries are actively supporting either side, I

1csag26,CMV: There is nothing wrong with female students helping a male teacher unbraid his hair,"If you haven’t seen the news recently JaQ Lee is a teacher that went viral for making a video with his female students helping him unbraid his hair. He only asked his students to help him unbraid his hair because he had a hair appointment after school that day and he wouldn’t be able to unbraid his hair in time if he waited until after school.

Prior to making this video he had already posted many videos of his students. It is very obvious that he loves his job and he loved his students. However recently he was fired for that video. Many people think it is inappropriate for him to have his female students unbraiding his hair even though it is obvious he had no ill intentions against his students. However I have to disagree.

It is a teachers job to build strong bonds with their students. A strong bond between a teacher and their student is the main way for a student to trust their teacher. A student who trusts their teacher is more likely to listen to that teacher when they teacher and is more likely to go to that teacher if they have any issues. It is obvious that this was just another way for him to bond with his students. 

Also it is just hair. People are acting as if the students were putting lotion on his back or cutting his toenails. The students were just helping him unbraid his hair what exactly is the harm behind that.

In the black community many of us don’t have strong male figures in our lives. When a male role model does enter our life we look up to them and admire them. Majority of his students are black. It is very possible that many of his students may not have a male role model in their life and because of the strong bond they have with their teacher they look up to him and admire him. Helping him unbraid his hair is a way for his students to bond with him and show their appreciation for him.

It is very possible that now since this teacher has been fired that the students in that classes grades will drop. They had a lot of trust and respect in Mr.Lee and it will be hard for a new teacher to gain these students trust and respect. The students may not listen in class anymore leading to their grades dropping. A lot of negative things could happen as a result to this school firing an amazing teacher.

173bl6u,"CMV: If there is a God, it's unfair for Him to sentence unbelievers to Hell as punishment when there are 4,000 religions in the world and it's impossible for someone to discern which one is correct.","Disclaimer: I'm only familiar with Christianity, and have some vague understanding of the other two Abrahamic religions (Islam and Judaism.) I know almost nothing about any other religion. So I cannot give adequate coverage of the other religions, all the more so given that 4,000 religions exist. I can only paint with a broad brush.

One central teaching of Christianity is that those who die unsaved will be suffer in Hell as their rightful outcome for not believing in Jesus as Lord and Savior. (Now, of course, many Christian denominations have different interpretations, but that's the overall gist of it.) 

And one argument that many Christians use is, ""God has made His existence clear and obvious to all, along with salvation, so we have no excuse on the day of Judgment.""

Indeed, a Bible verse, Romans 1:20, even says that explicitly: ""People are **without excuse** (for not believing in and knowing God.)""

Islam says similar things; that hell awaits the unbelievers.

The problem with all this, of course, is that 1) even if God exists, His existence is not obvious at all - the very fact that mankind has been debating His existence for millennia proves that it's not obvious - and 2) there are thousands of religions in the world. How are we supposed to know which one is correct?

To add a third point, **what religion one believes in is heavily influenced by geography and one's local culture.** If you were born in Iraq, you're almost certainly going to be a Muslim; if you were born in the Bible Belt in the USA, chances are you'll be a Christian, if you were born in Thailand, you'll likely be Buddhist, if you were born in India, you'll likely be Hindu, etc. So how is someone who was born in Iraq supposed to correctly ""deduce"" that Jesus is the one true Lord any more than someone born in Oklahoma or Alabama is supposed to think that Allah is god?

So the viewpoint I would be open to being changed is this: T**here isn't sufficient evidence for any one religion - out of 4,000 - to clearly and obviously stand out as the correct one - if religion is even the correct way to go at all (how do we know atheism isn't the right path?) And as such, it is unfair for God to throw someone into Hell for not drawing the correct religion-lottery number - correctly choosing the one out of 4,000.**

181mvuv,CMV:Social media is harming young men's view on women immensely and maybe the other way round is true as well.,"As a male I think the more time I spend on the internet and espically on short form content like youtube shorts or tiktok on top of social media like twitter the more I get shown specifically selected young women that show 0 empathy or understand of consequences for their actions while simultaneously thinking they are near perfect and expect a man to be the top 0.1% to be good enough for her. and I really think the way these algorithms work means you get shown this and show men talking about it with the idea ""women these days are like this""

I think its just awful and I don't know what is being shown to anybody the algorithms mark as women but can't imagine its any better. 

I know this stuff isn't accurate. I know meeting people irl will show you so many women who are awesome people and i could make a long list of women who are caring empathetic people. 

but my worry is even if I know the internet is showing me the worst to keep my attention is I don't think enough people do. I think lots of people are seeing this stuff and giving up on the idea of dating and start to believe it. believe you need to become this 6"" all muscle man who is a millionaire in his 20's or women will all turn you down. believe that if you marry a woman she is just waiting till somebody better comes along so she can leave you and take half your stuff. 

studies show men benifit more from marriage but the internet makes it all look like its better for women and a man is just taking a risk at her destorying his life and taking everything

1gl5345,"CMV: Most reddit mods are biased and remove/leave content which they personally disagree/agree with, despite it violating/not violating the rules of the subreddit.","Alright, let’s talk about something I’ve noticed happening on Reddit.   
  
Moderators there are supposed to be impartial, right? They’re tasked with enforcing rules fairly, keeping things balanced, and making sure discussions stay open for everyone. But lately, it seems like some moderators are letting personal beliefs influence what stays and what goes.   
  
They’re picking which posts stay visible based on whether they agree with them or not, which can feel unfair to a lot of users. Sometimes, posts that are technically against the rules are allowed to stay up if they fit a certain narrative. And other times, posts that don’t break any guidelines get removed because they don’t align with a particular perspective. This inconsistency in enforcement can lead to a sense of unfairness for a lot of users who feel like the playing field isn’t even.   
  
What I am seeing as a result is that Reddit is turning into more of an echo chamber in certain spaces. Many subreddits tend to show only one side of a conversation, one perspective. If you’ve got an opposing opinion, or you want to question the main views in those subs, it’s tough to have your voice heard.  


Take r/pics for example, we know that it got so much bad rep for political posts throughout the 2024 US Presidential Election cycle, I mean all of you who are active on that subreddit saw how we had 10s of posts everyday where embarrassing pictures regarding the two candidates were shared.   


But I saw that the posts which were against Donald Trump (Republicans) got 1000s of upvotes and comments. While the ones against the Democrats, got removed by mods there fairly quickly. Even though the posts did not break any rule.  
  
I believe this kind of moderation is harmful to free speech and people deserve a chance to share their perspectives in an open forum and feel confident that the rules are applied the same way to everyone.   
  
That said, I’m open to changing my mind on this. If there’s a valid reason why this approach to moderation is necessary or if someone can make a solid case for how it’s ultimately better for the community, I’m all ears.

1j8csfy,"CMV: The President of China (Xi Jinping) is now the most powerful person on Earth, not the president of America.","We were living in an American Century. Since World War 2, the President of the United States has been considered the most powerful person in the world. However, I believe that title now belongs to Xi Jinping, and not to Donald Trump (or any US president). 

China's economy cannot be understated. It has been the world's largest economy (PPP) for over a decade now. The country is a manufacturing giant, controls massive amounts of global supply chains, and has significant leverage over international trade. Not to mention it has 1.4 billion people to serve as its workforce, consumer base, and anything else the CCP needs.

The US, once the uncontested global leader, is in a state of deep political division, economic struggles, and social unrest. Partisan infighting, government gridlock, and internal strife make it harder for any president—especially Trump—to wield power effectively. The US’s global influence has also been waning as China expands its reach through its growing Belt and Road Empire.

The most significant factor is the difference in governance. The US president operates within a democratic system that imposes limits on power—courts, Congress, elections, media scrutiny, and public opinion all act as constraints. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping is an authoritarian leader who has effectively consolidated power, removed term limits, cracked down on dissent, and expanded surveillance and social control. In other words, he can dictate policies with little resistance, while a US president is constantly facing checks and opposition (despite what Trump and DOGE are trying).

China is making strategic moves to replace the US as the dominant global force. It is investing in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, gaining influence in regions the US has neglected. It is also developing economic alliances that reduce reliance on the dollar and expanding military capabilities, particularly in the South China Sea.

Putin might have been sabotaging America, but China is the real winner of America's repeated own goals. The USA still has massive soft power, but who knows how much longer that will last considering divisions and the current administration. The world order is shifting, and it’s time to acknowledge that the most powerful person on Earth might no longer be sitting in the White House.

I don't even like China, and have 0 plans to visit it, but facts are facts. Unless you can show me otherwise. CMV.

1epa315,CMV: Most Muslims only care about Islamophobia when it’s done by “the West” or by “the Jews”,"Islam, despite the fact that the most populous Muslim nation on the planet is in Southeast Asia, is still haunted by a profound thread of arab chauvinism. It’s been this way since the beginning when you see conflicts in North Africa between the indigenous Amazigh and the invading Arabs that conquered the land. Arabs were given preferential treatment, their Islam was more pure, their language more civilized. 

The Amazigh were barbarians being rescued by the Arabs and the Prophet and raised to civilization. 

Today not much as changes. Arabic is still used in almost every mosque on the planet, regardless of the languages of the region, most imams are Arabic and the Muslim world is still generally oriented around Muslims. It’s why whenever there’s any news about injustice being done to Muslims in America or in Gaza you’ll see massive protests among Arab Muslims in those same western countries or even, despot the dangers, the repressive theocracies of the Middle East. 

Yet notice how they never make a peep over the blatantly anti-Muslim tactics of China or the Rohingya in Myanmar? That’s because they’re just some Asians to them that happen to be go to a mosque. Not Muslims with caring about. Not Muslims worth caring about when compared to the idea of THE JEWS OR THE US oppressing them.

1cz17gg,"CMV: The reason there’s so much loneliness in America today is because we the people have replaced our traditional institutions of community in America with social media and the internet, which are half-measures at best and actively harmful at worst.","
Humans are, in my opinion, naturally lazy creatures who will always choose the path of least resistance in almost anything. This includes communication. Throughout most of human history our sense of community was connected to our ability to travel to meet other people or other peoples ability to travel to us. 

The postal service, mail, letters, tv radio shows and phones all altered the equation but none more fundamentally then the internet did. The internet offered something unique. The *closest* simulation you could get to having a person/people in the room with you while also being alone. It has the trappings of community but none of the soul.

Low investment, low barrier to entry. Those are the hallmarks of social media. Yes it’s monetized in variety of different ways but on the whole it’s accessible and easily available at no cost to almost anyone. But it’s this lack of investment that causes the problem. People feel less satisfied, more lonely and more disconnected because the crutches they’ve fallen back on — again the path of least resistance — are empty calories. They provide no real nutrition, no food for the soul, they can aid people in connecting but they’re a tool. Not a solution in my opinion. 

My nephew is the textbook example of social media’s failed promise. He’s probably on the autism spectrum, he’s naturally shy and as a result has almost no friends in school. But with social media, game chats and YouTube to provide nourishment it should be no problem right? 

Wrong. 

He’s almost graduated high school and god love him, he’s emotionally stunted. Idk how he’s gonna meet a man/woman, how he’ll fall in love, how he’ll build a network of friends, how he’ll even hold down a job if he’s never exercised, never developed, the “muscles” you need to form meaningful, longterm connections with other humans. 

It’s not to say people like that are doomed. They’re not. I’m not on the spectrum but I had many of the same problems as he did in school but I was forced/forced myself to develop a personality and learn how to work and be social outside of a screen. 

But if you’ve got a collection of electronic crutches to fall back on, you and by extension the rest of your society is going to splinter into smaller and smaller, more disconnected tribes that happen to share the same town, city or country.

1fz6425,CMV: Presidential Debates should have LIVE Fact Checking,"I think that truth has played a significant role in the current political climate, especially with the amount of 'fake news' and lies entering the media sphere. Last month, I watched President Trump and Vice President Harris debate and was shocked at the comments made by the former president.

For example, I knew that there were no states allowing for termination of pregnancies after 9 months, and that there were no Haitian Immigrants eating dogs in Springfield Ohio, but the fact that it was it was presented and has since claimed so much attention is scary. The moderators thankfully stepped in and fact checked these claims, but they were out there doing damage.

In the most recent VP Debate between Walz and Vance, no fact checking was a requirement made by the republican party, and Vance even jumped on the moderators for fact checking his claims, which begs the question, would having LIVE fact checking of our presidential debates be such a bad thing? Wouldn't it be better to make sure that wild claims made on the campaign trail not hold the value as facts in these debates?

I am looking for the pros/cons of requiring the moderators to maintain a sense of honesty among our political candidates(As far as that is possible lol), and fact check their claims to provide viewers with an informative understanding of their choices.

I will update the question to try and answer any clarification required.

1fqap5y,"CMV: If the private market fails, flood insurance should not be federally subsidized.","I am conflicted. I don't want friends and family to be left in the street, but I also don't believe the federal government should step in and use tax dollars to cover property damages for those who chose to live in flood prone areas. Those people chose to live in risky areas and people in less risky areas should not share the burden of costs incurred due to that risk. I get that the whole idea of insurance is to spread said burden around, but at least with insurance you choose to get a policy which differs from taxes where you have no choice. Change my view. 

To give an idea of the situation: Private insurance is either unavailable due to the level of risk or prohibitively expensive. With global warming causing more storms, rising sea levels exacerbating flooding, and a huge portion of the population being located on the coast this issue will only get worse.

1hamjcd,"CMV: Smaller, more intimate stakes are better in fiction than world-ending threats","Regarding movies, shows and games any presented world-ending threat is not taken seriously by the audience. ""If the bad guys win, the world/galaxy will end"" is met with the predefined knowledge that the good guys will win anyways. So there is no real tension for the audience. Especially in larger franchises.

However if the stake is smaller, lets say the possible death of a reoccurring character, the danger is more realistic to the audience, since there is a real chance the authors go through with it.

1biwpvb,"CMV: Progressives often sound like conservatives when it comes to ""incels""—characterizing the whole group by its extremists, insisting on a ""bootstrap mentality"" of self-improvement, framing issues in terms of ""entitlement,"" and generally refusing to consider larger systemic forces.","Married guy here. Happy relationship, sexually satisfied, father to a compassionate son, and I find fulfillment in my career.

I don't have a personal stake in the ""Incel Debates,"" but I do know a few loved ones who fit the term and I do spend way too much on the internet readings posts and articles discussing the topic.

Now, nothing in this post is intended to deny the reality that some incels are absolutely shitty people. I would say that I know four younger men who fall into this category and one of them (my youngest brother, actually) is someone I am deeply concerned for as he is now genuinely consumed with bitterness towards the world and women. However, the other three are genuinely great guys. They aren't 9s or 10s pulling down $200k while flexing their six-packs, but they're solid. **I'll put it this way:** I met my wife, dated, and got married in the late 2000s—before the rise of dating apps and the death of Third Spaces. ***If any of these three guys had been single during those years, they would have easily been able to strike up relationships.*** 

And yet I've seen these guys 1) get unfairly tagged with the ""incel"" label and its stigma and 2) listened to their sincere emotional pain over having very few outlets for discussing the loneliness and relational hardships they face. That's really what has prompted this post.

So as someone who grew up in a deeply conservative Southern community and left it for more progressive communities, why am I seeing so many ""conservative"" arguments made in attacking single men who feel like the deck is stacked against them?

**Someone CMV because what I'm seeing is:**

* ""Incels are dangerous misogynists and even terrorists."" This sounds like my conservative hometown talking about Muslims after 9/11. When is judging a whole group by its worst elements ever justified?
* ""Incels should focus on improving themselves instead of complaining all the time—then they'd get dates."" This sounds like my conservative town talking about poor people. Is ""picking yourself up by the bootstraps"" ever the solution to something that is affecting millions of people?
* ""Incels feel like they are *entitled* to sex. No one is entitled to *my* body!"" This sounds like my conservative hometown decades ago when it fought against the end of segregation or today when they cheer for the dismantling of affirmative action. ""No one is *entitled* to a position in my company, so I don't have to hire gay people"" or ""No is *entitled* to admission to Harvard, so they should be free to only admit Whites and Asians.""
* ""Incels just have a victim mentality. No one is oppressing them.""

1eusfr9,CMV: Being ABLE to work hard is a privilege which the average (able-bodied) person isn't aware of  ,"Before you come @ me about how it's a privilege to be able to not work (and I agree that there are certainly many circumstances where this is the case) please hear my perspective out...

I have been on both spectrums of being physically healthy/able-bodied, and being extremely chronically ill/disabled. When I was younger, I was an athlete (working out 5-6 days a week, 2-3hrs/day), able to do school full-time, and get straight-A's, and had multiple jobs. Basically, I was a type-A extremely hard-working, productive, and efficient member of society.

When I developed multiple chronic illnesses and health conditions in my early 20's, I went from being a superwoman who could do it all to basically completely bedridden. For a period of time my hands were disabled, I had 10/10 pain throughout my body 24/7, searing migraines, and I was physically incapable of walking. Needless to say, I could not work *any* type of job (blue-collared, white-collared, or otherwise) in that condition. At the worst of my health problems, it was literally impossible for me to work and I did end up living in my car for a period of time (in the beginning my family didn't believe my chronic illness was real and kicked me out because they thought I was mentally ill/lazy). Even jobs that could be done 100% online (which are already extremely limited for many career paths, particularly 10 years ago when I was in my 20's) were not possible for me due to the hand paralysis, migraines, and extreme neurological conditions (including light sensitivity to screens and very bad cognitive issues/brain fog).

After being told it's all in my head and that I'm just lazy/don't want to work (despite me being an extremely hard-working person for my entire life prior to my diagnosis) by virtually all of society, almost a decade later I finally have several diagnoses that validate my disabilities. I am also fortunate to have improved to some degree where I can still work (but not nearly to the extent that I used to be able to) with certain accommodations but I am still very limited by severe chronic pain and daily symptoms. I had to chance my entire career path and life around my disability, because the path I was taking was simply not accessible to me.

My chronic illness/disabilities essentially ruined my 20's, destroyed my bank account (medical bills leaving me with no savings, so I am nowhere near being able to save for things like a home or retirement). Coming from this perspective, it irks me sometimes when people deny that health/ability privilege is a real thing and act as if they do not have privilege to be able to work. I understand the plight of the lower-class/middle-class working person who needs to work very hard, sometimes in multiple jobs, to have a roof over their head and put food on the table. But for some people with severe disabilities/chronic illnesses, no matter how hard they want to or try, this is quite literally not possible or accessible. Many of those people end up losing everything and becoming homeless, then being further blamed and stigmatized for their situation.",anonykitcat,353,0.6800000071525574,414,1723929838,2024-08-17

1hn0ahj,Cmv: Pro-illegal immigration sentiments are astroturfed by corporations that benefit off of their labor,"Illegal immigration causes competition for housing and wages among the poorest Americans. It creates downward pressure on wages and working conditions.

They are pretty much exploited by default. Immigrants on work visas are already exploited enough.

Every single study I have read on the matter says that illegal immigration provides a net benefit to the economy, but the ones that go into the details find that it's the wealthy people that receive the benefit by exploiting the workers more. The working class is generally negatively impacted by this, even if the economy does better overall

There is, at the same time, no real benefit we provide the world on a meaningful scale by accepting refugees. There are specific, local scenarios where we can absolutely have a meaningful impact by accepting refugees. 

The best example of this has been how we accept Haitians. There's been general bipartisan support for accepting these people as refugees, and even Trump extended the protections first doled out by Obama after the earthquake

However, when everyone tries to claim asylum, the alternative means of entering the US that was necessary for these Haitians after their airport was shut down was made not viable. 

The only people who truly benefit off of Illegal immigration are the wealthy that exploit them for their labor

I hate the idea that we profit off the exploitation of a lower class of people

17hvq2p,"CMV: ""Don't politicize a tragedy"" is the weakest line in politics","So to be clear, this post isn't about gun laws or anything like that. Its related, but its besides the point. I have opinions on the matter, but their irrelevant to this post. Whenever something horrible happens, a politician may soon after suggest that it is evidence that a change of some kind needs to be made. While shootings are the obvious example, its not the only one. If, for instance, a state had a natural disaster, a politician might soon after suggest that it could have been handled better if we made certain reforms. After they do so however, you're likely to see a lot of people (including other politicians) call them out for ""politicizing a tragedy""

Ideally, politicians SHOULD be doing things to try and prevent further tragedies, so it makes sense to learn from the ones that have happened and to use them to make a point. Thats a part of their job of trying to make good decisions for society and represent people. Are they trying to get points politically from doing so? Probably, though in most cases I doubt it's their only reason. But whatever, their trying to earn political points on a constant basis, and there are far more immoral ways of doing so than simply using a tragedy to illustrate highlight a good or bad policy suggestion. To be clear, your free to disagree and strongly critique whatever it is they suggest, that's not my issue.

17zm3f0,CMV: people that don't opt-in for organs donation should go bottom of the list when it comes to become recipients,"This post is on the back of yesterday's post about how the default for organs donation should be opt-in and people should explicitly state that they want ot opt-out.

I was quite shocked at how many replies were against it, some people talked about ""tricking"" people, I'm not sure why, informative campaign could be done, is not some complex concept that the average person in the street can't understand. Also I'm not going into the debate on why people would rather have their organs rot in the ground instead of helping a fellow human being, but here's a proposal that I think would reconcile these views:

We keep the system as it is, but if you don't opt-in as an organ donor you go to the bottom of the list if you ever need one. Here are some points that got me to this idea:

* We already give priorities to organ recipients: age, medical history, etc (basically chances of survival) are already taken into consideration when lists are compiled, it's not just first come first served.
* It totally respects individual freedom
* It incentivize much needed organs donation  
* it's fair to people that opted in 

Just to reiterate: I'm not saying that people that are not organ donors DON'T get an organ ever, only that they get a lower score compared to people that opted-in, that's only fair, if you think your organs are too precious to donate even when you're dead, surely you can't expect others to do any differently. Otherwise you're just an HYPOCRITE. It's all about FAIRNESS. 

Now, I'm bias to the argument, my other half has received a kidney and is one of those things that people that haven't been through can't understand what it means to see a loved one getting sick, going through dialysis, going through the long process of getting into a recipient list and finally the long wait. 

Final couple of points: 

I'm sure there're super rare occasions where my POV may create some contradictions, we can discuss them and (as a society) find a solution, I don't believe in discarding good ideas just because they are not so good in the 0.1% of cases.   
Different countries have different protocols for organ donation/transplant. So pointing why it wouldn't work due to a specific law/regulation is a bit of a weak argument. I believe in principle every modern democratic country could implement this idea.

1g4b3ls,"CMV: In almost every practical way, No Tax on Tips is a bad policy","I don't know why both candidates are supporting it.

1. If you think people who make less should be paying less in taxes, just advocate that, adding complexity doesn't help.
2. It opens the door to more tip-based jobs in society. Surgeons will be making $2.13/hr with an expectation you tip 20% on your triple bypass surgery, and that be how they make their money. There's already an expectation to tip plastic surgeons. These large tips on expensive procedures being tax free will just continue us down the rabbit hole
3. If you want to incentivize people to work jobs like service industry jobs that are tip-based, the government shouldn't be the one doing it, the businesses should be. I would prefer business subsidies to businesses that pay their employees well over no tax on tips. This just perpetuates the cycle of businesses relying on the government instead of actually providing for their employees.

That meant at minimum the husband and wife had sex 14 times. Maybe the only sessions in their marriage and each session produced a child. But it was a given that the risk was always there.

194axin,CMV: It Should Be Illegal for Politicians to Tell Blatant Lies,"This is Trump-inspired. I was just listening to Trump speaking to reporters not five minutes ago after coming out of his civil trial in New York where he has already been found guilty of massively inflating the value of many of his properties and holdings and they are determining what the punishment/fine should be. He stood in front of reporters and stated, time and again, that ""this was the new way Democrats were stealing the elections"" and repeatedly said that all of these trials and charges he is facing are being coordinated by Biden. 

I understand that the news media can rebut these claims and can follow-up his conferences with fact-checks, but I don't think that is sufficient as he is consistently allowed a megaphone in which he can state huge, incredibly damaging lies that hurt our country and there is no reprecussion for doing so. 

I do not believe that politicians should be held liable/that it should be illegal for them to tell lies in that for example, they say they will do ""X"" for their constituents but then that doesn't happen. What I mean is it should be illegal to make such incredibly damaging and damning claims when there is literally no evidence to support it. This is because the types of claims Trump is making are the type that can lead to true disarray, hatred, anger, and potentially even civil war if allowed to carry on unpunished. 

When Trump tells people that Biden is coordinating charges against him when there is literally no evidence of this his supporters believe it. And this type of claim is the type of claim that angers and infuriates his supporters. They truly believe that the election was stolen (even though he had many, many chances in court to prove his claims and failed in every single one) and they truly believe that Biden is somehow coordinating an effort to put Trump behind bars.

The simple fact is, Trump clearly was told by many, many individuals that there was no evidence of fraud in the election but he plowed forward with ""stolen"" claims anyways. He called the Georgia secretary of state and asked him to find just enough votes for him to win. He did all these things and there are consequences. He brought this upon himself, not Biden. 

Why shouldn't it be illegal for candidates to tell these types of lies? In a world where gaslighting the public leads to true national division, can we really continue to allow such dangerous lies to be legally okay? What is the end of this type of lying? Where does it lead? It can't lead anywhere good and it infuriates me that he is allowed to just straight-up lie without consequences.

194d4tf,"CMV: Bar Rescue places way too much emphasis on ""overpouring.""","Disclaimer: I am very well aware that this is a TV show, and most of it is for ratings. However, getting angry at this, TV or not, is unhinged and baseless.

More specifically, they treat overpourers like assholes and criminals who are literally stealing money out of the owners pockets. Couple examples:

1. ""Grandpa got run over by his grandkids."" The family who owned the bar fired two bartenders who were overpouring and it was very clear they had no idea they were overpouring and obviously not overpouring on purpose or with malice intended. Meanwhile, the grandkids (who owned the bar) were taking cash from the register, caught on camera, left and right. But they acted like the overpouring bartenders were the thieves. They're not thieves. Jon Taffer and his crew are bar experts, and this could have been a training/learning opportunity not utilized.
2. ""Don't tell the mom the bar is dead"" Shawn Ford, one of Jon Taffer's experts, comes into the guys bar and berates him for serving a 9% ABV beer in a Mason Jar and not a ""snifter,"" going on about how it's ""irresponsible"" and even having a full-on shit fit and breaking his glassware. Sorry, but it's not that fucking serious. If Shawn Ford came into my house and started breaking my shit, I'd drag him out by his man bun. Total douche move that nobody thinks is unhinged and wrong.

1jeq5bb,CMV: Arabs are a lost cause,"As an Arab myself, I would really love for someone to tell me I am wrong and that the Arab world has bright future ahead of it because I lost hope in Arabs nearly a decade ago and the recent events in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Iraq have crashed every bit of hope i had left. 


The Arab world is the laughing stock of the world, nobody take us seriously or want Arab immigrants in their countries, why should they? Out of 22 Arab countries, 10 are failed states, 5 are stable but poor and has authoritarian regimes, 6 are rich, but with theocratic monarchies where slavery is still practiced. The only democracy with decent human rights in the Arab world is Tunisia who's poor and last year they have elected a dictator wannabe. 


And the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq are just embarrassing, Arabs are killing eachother over something that happened 1400 years ago (battle of Karabala) while we are seeing the west trying to get colonize mars. 


I don't think Arabs are capable to make a developed democratic state that doesn't violate human rights, its either secular dictatorship or Islamic dictatorship. When the Arabs have a democracy they always vote for an Islamic dictatorship instead like what happened in Palestine, Iraq, Egypt and Tunisia. 

> ""If the Arabs had the choice between two states, secular and religious, they would vote for the religious and flee to the secular.""

1kv4rk6,CMV: 55+ Communities are just a way to legally discriminate against young people,"For background, I work in real estate and this always annoys me. How can people over the age of 55 be allowed to discriminate against people under the age of 55?

People always point to communities that have certain 'quotas' of young people, but there are communities that outright deny ANYONE under 55, and they deny anyone with kids as well. Familial status is a protected class just the same as age, but age seems to supersede familial status. Why can't communities say ""only college-aged individuals allowed"" or ""Under 40 community""? 

I've talked with lawyers and most just shrug and ask why I care. Does anyone have a good/decent explanation for this?

Yeah whatever that might be true but at the end of the day, if democrats couldn’t pick someone more attractive to the voters than Donald Trump then they need to figure out why that is and what to do about it. 

Because frankly the more whining democrats do about what the other side voted for and wants, the more they will continue to push voters in that direction.  

I won’t even go into all the shit dems have done wrong. I voted for Kamala myself bc not Trump was enough motivation for me but not Trump isn’t good enough these days so they need to figure out what is. 

It’s along the same of if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself. Can’t expect other people to change, to want what you want, etc. you have to step up and change and do things yourself to get what you want.

1i86unn,"CMV: I’m Afraid This Administration Will Make Life Substantially Worse for Black Americans, and I Don’t Know If There’s a Line They Won’t Cross","I’m scared, and I’m looking for reassurance. As a Black person, I’ve already concluded that Trump and Elon Musk are racist, based on their actions and statements. What I’m struggling with is this fear that life under this administration will get substantially worse for people like me—and that their supporters won’t ever draw a line, no matter how bad things get.

Here are some things that have already happened or seem to be in the works:
	
Ending Equal Opportunity Programs: Trump revoked policies aimed at promoting racial equity in hiring and government programs.

Stop-and-Frisk: He signed an executive order encouraging its return, which disproportionately impacts Black and brown communities.
	
Wildfire Risks: Water is being rerouted from Northern California, a region that hasn’t had major wildfires in years, to Central California. This feels like it’s putting lives at risk unnecessarily.
	
Elon Musk’s Nazi Affiliation: Musk has amplified neo-Nazi accounts on Twitter, seemingly supported Germany’s far-right party, and even made what looks like a Nazi salute at a public event.

I’m terrified of what this could escalate to. Discrimination in hiring might push more Black people into desperate situations like selling drugs or stealing to survive. With policies like stop-and-frisk, that could mean more of us ending up incarcerated. My biggest fear is that there’s no “step too far” for their supporters. Would things like migrant camps or even more explicit authoritarian measures finally make people realize this is heading into Nazi territory? Or will they just keep defending every action?

1gk33fs,CMV: Islamophobia is not irrational,"First off, I’m not interested in comparing Islam to other religions in this post, this discussion is only about Islam, so please keep comments focused on that.

For context, I grew up in Iran around Shia Muslims. Most of the people around me identified as Muslim in name, but many didn’t strictly follow the religion, and some even despised it. Personally, I hold a very critical view of Islam.

From my perspective, Islam promotes outdated, unhealthy, and often bigoted ideas. While I know not all Muslims follow these beliefs to the letter, these aspects are deeply rooted in the ideology. A few examples I find concerning:

* Islam often promotes misogynistic beliefs that limit women’s freedom.
* It teaches intolerance towards homosexuals and apostates.
* It encourages violence against its enemies and places a strong emphasis on martyrdom and military supremacy.
* The goal of Islam, as stated in its texts, is to dominate the world as the true religion.

With these factors in mind, I think a critical view or even fear of Islam isn’t irrational. I believe that acknowledging these issues is important, rather than ignoring them under the guise of tolerance.",Empty_Alternative859,1209,0.7200000286102295,1085,1730799942,2024-11-05 03:45:42,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gk33fs/cmv_islamophobia_is_not_irrational/,11,2024,0.1125697407285855,0.2601391888648908,0.18635446479673815,cmv islamophobia is not irrational,first off i m not interested in comparing islam to other religions in this post this discussion is only about islam so please keep comments focused on that for context i grew up in iran around shia muslims most of the people around me identified as muslim in name but many didn t strictly follow the religion and some even despised it personally i hold a very critical view of islam from my perspective islam promotes outdated unhealthy and often bigoted ideas while i know not all muslims follow these beliefs to the letter these aspects are deeply rooted in the ideology a few examples i find concerning islam often promotes misogynistic beliefs that limit women s freedom it teaches intolerance towards homosexuals and apostates it encourages violence against its enemies and places a strong emphasis on martyrdom and military supremacy the goal of islam as stated in its texts is to dominate the world as the true religion with these factors in mind i think a critical view or even fear of islam isn t irrational i believe that acknowledging these issues is important rather than ignoring them under the guise of tolerance,1,cmv islamophobia is not irrational first off i m not interested in comparing islam to other religions in this post this discussion is only about islam so please keep comments focused on that for context i grew up in iran around shia muslims most of the people around me identified as muslim in name but many didn t strictly follow the religion and some even despised it personally i hold a very critical view of islam from my perspective islam promotes outdated unhealthy and often bigoted ideas while i know not all muslims follow these beliefs to the letter these aspects are deeply rooted in the ideology a few examples i find concerning islam often promotes misogynistic beliefs that limit women s freedom it teaches intolerance towards homosexuals and apostates it encourages violence against its enemies and places a strong emphasis on martyrdom and military supremacy the goal of islam as stated in its texts is to dominate the world as the true religion with these factors in mind i think a critical view or even fear of islam isn t irrational i believe that acknowledging these issues is important rather than ignoring them under the guise of tolerance
1cpdcgp,"CMV: Biden's attempt to appease both sides of the Gaza issue is hurting his electoral chances, he should commit to one side and accept the consequences.","Recently, there have been multiple reports on the divide between Netanyahu and Biden, but they have been conflicting, or at least mixed messages. Here's a report by [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68984999) saying that it is ""reasonable to assess"" that arms supplied by the US have been used in ways ""inconsistent"" with Israel's obligations, but in the same [report](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-administration-says-israel-isnt-violating-us-weapons-terms-rcna151764) it says that it hasn’t verified specific instances that would justify withholding military aid, and the headline used for each outlet is different depending on what the journalist prefer to highlight. Biden has also withheld military supplies and threatened to withhold more, as reported [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68980820), but not enough to actually stop the Rafah invasion from happening. 

To me, this is an attempt by him to appease both the pro-Israel and the pro-Palestine camps within the Democratic party, but I think he's failing at both. Pro-Israel folks will see this as a severe stepback from the unconditional support US has historically provided to Israel, while the Pro-Palestine folks will still see him as complicit in the genocide in Gaza as long as the Rafah invasion goes ahead, and the campus protests are unlikely to die out anytime soon. I think the most disastrous outcome for Biden is neither side doesn't feel like they can vote for him anymore in the election, handing Trump a victory. He should commit to one side, either back Israel unconditionally or withhold significantly more arms sales and aid so that America is no longer complicit in what's happening in Gaza.

1dek023,CMV: People shouldn't vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election because he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election,"Pretty simple opinion here. 

Donald Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. That's not just the Jan 6 riot, it's his efforts to submit fake electors, have legislatures overturn results, have Congress overturn results, have the VP refuse to read the ballots for certain states, and have Governors find fake votes. 

This was bad because the results weren't fraudulent. A House investigation, a Senate investigation, a DOJ investigation, various courts, etc all have examined this extensively and found the results weren't fraudulent.

So Trump effectively tried to overthrow the government. Biden was elected president and he wanted to take the power of the presidency away from Biden, and keep it himself. If he knew the results weren't fraudulent, and he did this, that would make him evil. If he genuinely the results were fraudulent, without any evidence supporting that, that would make him dangerously idiotic. Either way, he shouldn't be allowed to have power back because it is bad for a country to have either an evil or dangerously idiotic leader at the helm.

1ahyd7d,CMV: The sentence of Bryn Spejcher for stabbing her boyfriend to death was ridiculous.,"I'm refering to the California woman who stabbed her boyfriend 108 times after consuming cannabis and only sentenced last month to 100 days of community service.

This case reminds me of Sarah Halimi's one in France where an elderly lady got thrown off a window by a man who had just taken cannabis before his rampage and was considered not criminally responsible penally.

Although, contrarily to that other murder I do think that Bryn was indeed in a serious state of psychosis as she not only stabbed her boyfriend but her dog, and herself. And when the police intervened, even taser and baton strikes were not very effective at stopping her.

That being said I do believe that the sentence she received was highly problematic (way too low) for these 4 reasons:

* Even if marijuana frenzies can potentially happen on rare occasions, I just don't believe a mentally stable person could reach such violence with only marijuana. This led me to believe that she either consumed other additional substances or that she has some sort of mental instability that can lead her to become violent in some instances. And if that second hypothesis is true, then she needs psychiatric treatment (which was the decision for Sarah Halimi's murderer)
* Maybe the most important of my 4 points: Her not being aware during the killing doesn't mean she isn't responsible for it. The fact that she willingly decided to take psychotropic drugs that could potentially cloud her judgment meant she was responsible for putting herself in that state. Correct me if I'm wrong but if a person after consuming alcohol becomes violent a attacks others, he will be convicted. Removing all responsibility for marijuana sounds like encouragement for murderers to use this excuse and be cleared of charges.
* Receiving only 100 days of community service after brutally killing someone is shameful and a total disrespect for the deceased and his family. It just isn't right.
* Let's not fool ourselves, she only got this miraculous judgment because she was an upper-class white woman. If it was a man, poor or of color that sentencing would have been different.

And for these 4 reasons are believe that Bryn judgment was not only unfair but dangerous.",vuzz33,544,0.8299999833106995,621,1706973492,2024-02-03 09:18:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ahyd7d/cmv_the_sentence_of_bryn_spejcher_for_stabbing/,2,2024,0.03982058855705065,0.14878809695224382,0.09430434275464723,cmv the sentence of bryn spejcher for stabbing her boyfriend to death was ridiculous,i m refering to the california woman who stabbed her boyfriend 108 times after consuming cannabis and only sentenced last month to 100 days of community service this case reminds me of sarah halimi s one in france where an elderly lady got thrown off a window by a man who had just taken cannabis before his rampage and was considered not criminally responsible penally although contrarily to that other murder i do think that bryn was indeed in a serious state of psychosis as she not only stabbed her boyfriend but her dog and herself and when the police intervened even taser and baton strikes were not very effective at stopping her that being said i do believe that the sentence she received was highly problematic way too low for these 4 reasons even if marijuana frenzies can potentially happen on rare occasions i just don t believe a mentally stable person could reach such violence with only marijuana this led me to believe that she either consumed other additional substances or that she has some sort of mental instability that can lead her to become violent in some instances and if that second hypothesis is true then she needs psychiatric treatment which was the decision for sarah halimi s murderer maybe the most important of my 4 points her not being aware during the killing doesn t mean she isn t responsible for it the fact that she willingly decided to take psychotropic drugs that could potentially cloud her judgment meant she was responsible for putting herself in that state correct me if i m wrong but if a person after consuming alcohol becomes violent a attacks others he will be convicted removing all responsibility for marijuana sounds like encouragement for murderers to use this excuse and be cleared of charges receiving only 100 days of community service after brutally killing someone is shameful and a total disrespect for the deceased and his family it just isn t right let s not fool ourselves she only got this miraculous judgment because she was an upper class white woman if it was a man poor or of color that sentencing would have been different and for these 4 reasons are believe that bryn judgment was not only unfair but dangerous,0,cmv the sentence of bryn spejcher for stabbing her boyfriend to death was ridiculous i m refering to the california woman who stabbed her boyfriend 108 times after consuming cannabis and only sentenced last month to 100 days of community service this case reminds me of sarah halimi s one in france where an elderly lady got thrown off a window by a man who had just taken cannabis before his rampage and was considered not criminally responsible penally although contrarily to that other murder i do think that bryn was indeed in a serious state of psychosis as she not only stabbed her boyfriend but her dog and herself and when the police intervened even taser and baton strikes were not very effective at stopping her that being said i do believe that the sentence she received was highly problematic way too low for these 4 reasons even if marijuana frenzies can potentially happen on rare occasions i just don t believe a mentally stable person could reach such violence with only marijuana this led me to believe that she either consumed other additional substances or that she has some sort of mental instability that can lead her to become violent in some instances and if that second hypothesis is true then she needs psychiatric treatment which was the decision for sarah halimi s murderer maybe the most important of my 4 points her not being aware during the killing doesn t mean she isn t responsible for it the fact that she willingly decided to take psychotropic drugs that could potentially cloud her judgment meant she was responsible for putting herself in that state correct me if i m wrong but if a person after consuming alcohol becomes violent a attacks others he will be convicted removing all responsibility for marijuana sounds like encouragement for murderers to use this excuse and be cleared of charges receiving only 100 days of community service after brutally killing someone is shameful and a total disrespect for the deceased and his family it just isn t right let s not fool ourselves she only got this miraculous judgment because she was an upper class white woman if it was a man poor or of color that sentencing would have been different and for these 4 reasons are believe that bryn judgment was not only unfair but dangerous

1et5esf,"CMV: The concept of ""You don't owe anyone an explanation"" is stupid. ","I've been increasingly hearing this over and over for the past few years from people who are overly entitled and sensitive, and it's really getting on my nerves.

Yes, if you leave your partner of 5 years, you owe them an explanation. You just took 5 years of their life, you don't just get to ghost after all that time.

Yes, if you've been friends with someone and you want to stop being friends over life/philosophical/political differences, you DO owe them an explanation and a chance to talk it through.

Yes, if you're quitting your job with no notice and no consideration for your coworkers, you owe them an explanation.

The exception is obviously abuse, if they're mistreating you, you should leave - although the definition of abuse has been so diluted it no longer holds much meaning.   
  
Obviously there's no feelings police, nobody's gonna come after you- but it does make you a piece of shit. It's just cowardice combined with a lack of accountability. It's not pride and maturity to cut ties with someone with no explanation, it's sneaking away like a spineless loser.

1cqsuws,"CMV:Islam is evil, and the biggest threat to the West","First. Let’s get this out the way before someone’s chimes in with the “Islamophobic” retort. Criticizing Islam isn’t hateful. Or racist. Arabs are fine. Islam is not. I hold all 3 religions in nearly equal contempt. However the other two are in the 21st century at least. There are a frightening number of radicals worldwide. The religion itself was built on conquest and spread by the sword. Muhammad was a pedophile. And Islam actually got better for awhile. Then I want to say around the 1700s/1800s you started having these different schools of thought. Then you had Sayyid Qutb come along in the early 1900s. He’s basically the father of modern day Islamism. Let me explain two different kinds of people. 

There is a difference between radicals and terrorists. A small minority are terrorists.

15-25% of all muslims are radical in their beliefs, meaning they believe one or a combination of the following:

1.	⁠Being gay should be illegal.
2.	⁠Honor killings are sometimes justified.
3.	⁠Apostates should be killed.
4.	⁠Terrorist attacks against civilian centers is sometimes justified.

Anyone who believes those things is a radical. Regardless if Islam teaches it or some government says it. In this specific case, 15-25% or more muslims believe some of these things. There are polls recently that show close to 90 percent of Gazans support Hamas. A majority supported October 7th. 93 percent of Palestinians oppose homosexuality. Close to 40 percent of young British Muslims believe apostates should be killed. I can go on and on. And that is why I believe Islam evil and a grave threat.

That’s not accidental. That’s a pattern. While working families bleed out, his billionaire buddies are sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the dip — then buying in cheap.

This isn’t “America First.” It’s “My Circle First.”

He's not just out of touch — he’s using the chaos to consolidate power and wealth. He keeps the culture war burning so nobody looks at the financial war he’s quietly winning. While people argue about pronouns and flags, his friends are quietly buying distressed assets and laughing their way to the bank.

And if you call it out? He says you're “fake news” or “part of the problem.”

He Keeps Echoing Russian Talking Points! Whether it’s doubting Ukraine’s legitimacy, suggesting NATO is useless, or taking Putin’s word over U.S. intelligence, he has a history of saying things that conveniently benefit Russia.

He’s undermining ukraine right when it needs support most! By calling Zelenskyy a dictator, he’s fueling skepticism about military aid, which plays right into Putin’s hands.

It’s not just Words, it’s actions too! Let’s not forget that Trump literally withheld aid from Ukraine in 2019, leading to his first impeachment. Even now, he’s openly saying he’d let Russia do “whatever the hell they want” if NATO countries don’t pay up.",No_Discussion6913,1103,0.8700000047683716,498,1740053714,2025-02-20 06:15:14,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1itx4hk/cmv_trump_recent_comments_on_ukraine_prove_hes/,2,2025,0.10097363526966414,0.11927045836333093,0.11012204681649754,cmv trump recent comments on ukraine prove he s basically a russian asset,so trump recently called zelenskyy a dictator which let s be real is straight out of the kremlin s playbook russia has been trying to paint ukraine s government as illegitimate since day one to justify their invasion now trump is repeating that same narrative right when u s support for ukraine is on shaky ground this isn t just a one off there s a pattern here he keeps echoing russian talking points whether it s doubting ukraine s legitimacy suggesting nato is useless or taking putin s word over u s intelligence he has a history of saying things that conveniently benefit russia he s undermining ukraine right when it needs support most by calling zelenskyy a dictator he s fueling skepticism about military aid which plays right into putin s hands it s not just words it s actions too let s not forget that trump literally withheld aid from ukraine in 2019 leading to his first impeachment even now he s openly saying he d let russia do whatever the hell they want if nato countries don t pay up,0,cmv trump recent comments on ukraine prove he s basically a russian asset so trump recently called zelenskyy a dictator which let s be real is straight out of the kremlin s playbook russia has been trying to paint ukraine s government as illegitimate since day one to justify their invasion now trump is repeating that same narrative right when u s support for ukraine is on shaky ground this isn t just a one off there s a pattern here he keeps echoing russian talking points whether it s doubting ukraine s legitimacy suggesting nato is useless or taking putin s word over u s intelligence he has a history of saying things that conveniently benefit russia he s undermining ukraine right when it needs support most by calling zelenskyy a dictator he s fueling skepticism about military aid which plays right into putin s hands it s not just words it s actions too let s not forget that trump literally withheld aid from ukraine in 2019 leading to his first impeachment even now he s openly saying he d let russia do whatever the hell they want if nato countries don t pay up
1m5ukdm,"CMV: Christians, based on their own teachings, should lean left politically.","This is based on a few verses.

First of which (and the strongest pointer, in my opinion) would be the Parable of Sheep and Goats. Jesus is essentially saying that the treatment of the lowest in society should be of the same quality as the treatment we would give to Jesus himself, and we would be rewarded with eternal glory. Neglect of the lowest in society is the same as neglecting Jesus, and, thus, you should burn in eternal damnation. 

Then there's Proverbs 30:8-9. ""Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me, lest I be full and deny you and say, “Who is the Lord?” or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God."" It seems like they are saying that we should only take what we need, and we should provide for those who have need. It, certainly, seems to show a distaste for those who live in luxury while others suffer.

1 Corinthians 10:24, ""Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor"" This seems to be stating that we should provide for others and others will provide for us. 

Deuteronomy 14:28-29, ""At the end of every three years you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in the same year and lay it up within your towns. And the Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance with you, and the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your towns, shall come and eat and be filled, that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands that you do."" AKA you should feed those who you owe nothing to and you will rewarded. 

1 Corinthians 12:26 ""If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together."" We exist as a collective, and should only suffer if it is together, and work together towards a common good. 

James 5:1-20 ""Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days. Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, are crying out against you, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter"" 

I think you get the point. The Bible oftentimes points to this idea of working towards a greater good regardless of personal reward or suffering. I feel like this is very in line with my personal ideals (to be brief, Libertarian Socialist) of providing welfare to those in need and providing tools for the people who are down on their luck to pull themselves up with. Additionally, I believe that these verses strongly frown on those that see somebody suffering and kind of shrug and say, ""not my problem,"" as many right-wing people would say about welfare issues, as well as frowning on people who hoard wealth in general.

I guess, to change my views you would need to show that A) the left does not actually align itself to the passages stated (and there are more that I left unstated) B) that the ideals above are not actually contradicted by right-wing policies C) that I am misinterpreting the verses above, and the more reasonable interpretation aligns more with right-wing policies or D) IDK, if I knew all the ways I could change my opinion, I wouldn't be here.

16q2x1q,"CMV: All schools should have a mandatory subject about ''after school life'' which cover topics such as student loans, politics and basic law/rights.","The reason for a CMV about this is because to me this sounds like it's obviously a good thing and should most definitely be done, but I'm also fairly certain that there's a reason it's not. I just can't think of a *good* reason as to why it isn't compulsory other than the education system as a whole is outdated and needs an overhaul but it doesn't happen for whatever reason. I don't know too much about this, so excuse the ignorance.   


A subject like this should be compulsory for all students, but passing/failing it has no impact on whether or not they pass school. It should however impact whether or not they're able to apply for a student loan. If they're unable to pass a basic test about how student loans work and what they'll end up paying and the laws about it, then they simply should not be able to get it. It seems irresponsible to have an 18 year old kid take out a contract like that without them understanding the basics of it.   


Other topics covered by this subject should include stuff like basic politics and how the political system works. The consequence for failing this part should be that they're unable to vote ( or at least unable to until a certain age ) with the ability to retake the test as many times as they want, at no cost. I understand some people would strongly disagree with this because they may feel like it's some kind of discrimination and I imagine these would be the same type of people who disagree with voters requiring ID, but I'm fairly certain that the vast majority of people would agree to this. Oh, and also a government ID should be issued to them too at school. Absolutely no reason to not have one. I'm from South Africa and got my ID in grade 10. And if a country like that can get this right, I see no reason for a ''first world'' country to mess it up.   


Of course, this isn't a perfect list of topics that ''should'' be covered, but this is a rough idea on my thoughts. Nitpicking at an oversight or tiny detail is not going to change my view, rather fault the idea itself. The reason I believe this to be the right thing to do has nothing to do with discriminating against illiterate people or people one might believe to be stupid, it is simply there to help someone better understand the world they're stepping into. Failing to understand the basics of something like a loan should be viewed in the same way as failing to understand the contract you're signing where it says '' sign here to  confirm you understand the T&C '', except that this is a test to ensure that you do actually understand the basics of the T&C's

187wktd,"CMV: The notion that the Democrats or Republicans ""must"" run Biden or Trump ""because there are no other viable candidates"" is ridiculous. There are thousands of people who would make better presidential candidates for 2024 than Biden or Trump.","Every argument for Biden or Trump to run in 2024 boils down to some version of ""status quo"" or ""inertia."" We're told that the Ds and Rs have no choice but to run these super-old candidates because there's nobody else who could be suitable.

&#x200B;

In a nation of 332,000,000 people, there are well over 100 million who are over the age of 35, American-born, and have resided in the United States for 14 years or more - in other words, are constitutionally eligible to run for president.

Out of those 100 million, surely at least half have a basic education, are mature, sensible, decent people, and have demonstrated solid character - and also be significantly younger than Trump or Biden.

Out of those 50 million, surely at least ten million would qualify as *highly* educated - the metrics of which can be tricky to figure out (is it a master's degree? or something else?) - but they would be significantly above average.

Out of those 10 million, surely at least one million would be quite exceptional - people who have substantially high IQ, have advanced quite far in life and a career - such as being a doctor, or having worked in public governmental service for decades, etc.

And out of those million, surely at least 10,000 would have the political know-how, the charisma, the political interest, maybe have spent significant time abroad in foreign countries or speak multiple languages, to be a suitable president.

In fact, even in Congress, state legislatures or governorships alone, there must be dozens of good, qualified, educated, experienced politicians who would be much younger than Trump or Biden, and who would make suitable presidential candidates. 

So, CMV on this one. I don't buy for one moment the notion that, in a nation of 332 million people, America somehow has no choice but to run Biden vs. Trump in 2024 because ""we've got no one else who'd be a good candidate.""

1folf4q,CMV: Police haven't been defunded by and large they have just stopped enforcing laws and that's why crime has got so our of control in California. ,"Police use the ""well the DA isn't going to prosecute this any way - so why should I arrest someone "" line all the time out here. I've noticed the police in my short lifespan go from hawking profilers to being so lax they will see a crime happening right in front of them and just ask the perpetrator to move along. 

I go to the grocery store almost every day and over the last few years I've noticed the influx of people just walking In and walking out with shopping carts loaded with food and booze. The workers tell me the police won't do anything unless it's a felony charge. 

So now they have their own ARMED security and even they can only do so much without a threat of violence. 

Drug use is rampant on the street I can't go out for a bike ride without seeing at least one pilo being smoked out of let alone not see a needle or two.

Traffic violations too, what the fuck happened to the California stop? People used to at least pretend to stop now it's just fly thru the intersection and screw having a rotation of ya snooze for a second you lose I'm going ! Even if it's not my turn. (Not me but that's what I assume everyone is saying now )

People speed in excess everywhere don't stop don't care about pedestrians and this all started over the last 5 years

They are only doing this so the citizens DEMAND a more strict police force and more serious punishments for petty crimes so we all go back to that what cops say go mentality it's extremely obvious to me but I'm wondering if anyone out there can change my view or offer an explanation. 

No police in my area have been defunded they got more money and newer cars actually they just aren't doing their jobs any more , don't get me wrong I don't mind not having to worry as much about nothing but small businesses suffer pedestrians are getting hit by cars more and the open use of extreme hard drugs like meth heroin and fentanyl along with not prosecuting major thefts is kind of insane ",H2OULookinAtDiknose,1002,0.7599999904632568,761,1727206971,2024-09-24 14:42:51,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1folf4q/cmv_police_havent_been_defunded_by_and_large_they/,9,2024,0.0899245159172957,0.18238540916726662,0.13615496254228115,cmv police haven t been defunded by and large they have just stopped enforcing laws and that s why crime has got so our of control in california,police use the well the da isn t going to prosecute this any way so why should i arrest someone line all the time out here i ve noticed the police in my short lifespan go from hawking profilers to being so lax they will see a crime happening right in front of them and just ask the perpetrator to move along i go to the grocery store almost every day and over the last few years i ve noticed the influx of people just walking in and walking out with shopping carts loaded with food and booze the workers tell me the police won t do anything unless it s a felony charge so now they have their own armed security and even they can only do so much without a threat of violence drug use is rampant on the street i can t go out for a bike ride without seeing at least one pilo being smoked out of let alone not see a needle or two traffic violations too what the fuck happened to the california stop people used to at least pretend to stop now it s just fly thru the intersection and screw having a rotation of ya snooze for a second you lose i m going even if it s not my turn not me but that s what i assume everyone is saying now people speed in excess everywhere don t stop don t care about pedestrians and this all started over the last 5 years they are only doing this so the citizens demand a more strict police force and more serious punishments for petty crimes so we all go back to that what cops say go mentality it s extremely obvious to me but i m wondering if anyone out there can change my view or offer an explanation no police in my area have been defunded they got more money and newer cars actually they just aren t doing their jobs any more don t get me wrong i don t mind not having to worry as much about nothing but small businesses suffer pedestrians are getting hit by cars more and the open use of extreme hard drugs like meth heroin and fentanyl along with not prosecuting major thefts is kind of insane,0,cmv police haven t been defunded by and large they have just stopped enforcing laws and that s why crime has got so our of control in california police use the well the da isn t going to prosecute this any way so why should i arrest someone line all the time out here i ve noticed the police in my short lifespan go from hawking profilers to being so lax they will see a crime happening right in front of them and just ask the perpetrator to move along i go to the grocery store almost every day and over the last few years i ve noticed the influx of people just walking in and walking out with shopping carts loaded with food and booze the workers tell me the police won t do anything unless it s a felony charge so now they have their own armed security and even they can only do so much without a threat of violence drug use is rampant on the street i can t go out for a bike ride without seeing at least one pilo being smoked out of let alone not see a needle or two traffic violations too what the fuck happened to the california stop people used to at least pretend to stop now it s just fly thru the intersection and screw having a rotation of ya snooze for a second you lose i m going even if it s not my turn not me but that s what i assume everyone is saying now people speed in excess everywhere don t stop don t care about pedestrians and this all started over the last 5 years they are only doing this so the citizens demand a more strict police force and more serious punishments for petty crimes so we all go back to that what cops say go mentality it s extremely obvious to me but i m wondering if anyone out there can change my view or offer an explanation no police in my area have been defunded they got more money and newer cars actually they just aren t doing their jobs any more don t get me wrong i don t mind not having to worry as much about nothing but small businesses suffer pedestrians are getting hit by cars more and the open use of extreme hard drugs like meth heroin and fentanyl along with not prosecuting major thefts is kind of insane
1keqtit,CMV: it’s perfectly reasonable to drop friends over political views,"I’ll start by clarifying that I’m a leftist, and that will inform a lot of the examples I use, but I don’t think you need to be a leftist to agree with me here. 
Lots of people, admittedly less these days, talk about how silly it is to stop being friends with someone or dislike someone over their political views. I don’t agree. People who say this act as if politics are some given trait or private matter like religion or culture, when it’s inherently not. Especially in a democratic country, a person’s political views have an impact on the society they are a part of. Yes, people inherit their beliefs from their family or whatever sometimes, but ultimately political views are rarely arbitrary, people tend to have reasoning to support theirs. I want to exclude from this people who clearly haven’t critically engaged with their views or politics. If you grew up in a republican household for example, and you study engineering and kind of just follow headlines, you aren’t really responsible for those views. Also, I mean this more for close friends. If you run in the same circles as someone you disagree with, there’s no reason to make an issue of it if they’re not someone you’re close with, trust, or love, ect.  
I’m not just talking about hateful or extreme views though, like thinking that gay people are sinful or supporting the deportation of green card holders for expressing their beliefs. Even basic beliefs about tax structure, regulations, or welfare. Just because those aren’t as flashy/provocative, doesn’t make them unimportant (they are often more impactful and broad in reach even). Like I said, I’m generally a leftist. If you are a “moderate” or believe in fiscal/macroeconomic policy that maintains the status quo, I think I should be totally justified in having a problem with that. 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and you believe that’s okay? Thats your right, but to me it shows we don’t have the same values (even ethically speaking) and I don’t want to have a close relationship with you. 
Let’s say you’re right libertarian leaning, and you think a too powerful state poses an existential risk, or maybe you think property is a god given right and wealth redistribution violates natural law or something (sorry if this sounds like a straw man for the right, that’s not my point though. If your friend believes in lots of regulation and democratic socialism, I think you have a good reason not to want to be close friends with them. 
Look, I’m not saying you should do this. I have lots of friends I disagree with about this stuff and I’m willing to look past it. I just think politics are a legitimate reason to end or loosen a relationship with someone.

1hwzoat,"CMV: Trump is not fit to be the face of America, let alone the president.","This post is really just relevant to American users, but I'd like to hear the opinions of anybody outside the country if they do have a say. I, personally, do not understand how people can openly support Trump with the vast amount of information out there that definitely does not paint him as a good person. I've seen most supporters say that they voted for him hoping for cheaper gas prices, groceries, and to ""Make America Great Again."" I believe the country has never truly been great and needs much work, but that is an entirely different conversation.  
 Even if I did believe Trump could and would do everything his supporters are hoping for, I would not vote for him. Why? He was openly a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein for, according to Epstein himself, 10 whole years. There are clips of the two of them talking about women's looks - which I doubt their conversations were respectful after the ""grab 'em by the pussy"" comment. Trump says these exact words about Epstein: ""I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy... It is even said that he likes women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."" I'm not saying that Trump was a part of Epstein's crimes, but I would not be surprised if such news were to ever be revealed. I am simply pointing out who he has been associated with - for example, Matt Gaetz, who was said to have paid a 17-year-old girl for sex. Trump has faced similar allegations of sexual assault since 1970- 26 different allegations, to be exact. He has denied all of them, but considering the people he is around and the things he has said, it is very hard to believe him. As just about everyone knows, he IS a convicted felon.  
 America might need the cheaper gas prices, we might need the cheaper groceries, the walls, the need to be great, but is it truly worth putting the state of the country into the hands of a felon? The hands of a man that has likely touched and hurt women without a care in the world? Hands that shook with Jeffrey Epstein? No. I would truly love to know how anybody could ever choose that just for a cheaper life. ",Silent_Ice6040,482,0.6800000071525574,739,1736382170,2025-01-08 18:22:50,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hwzoat/cmv_trump_is_not_fit_to_be_the_face_of_america/,1,2025,0.03303796083579477,0.1771058315334773,0.10507189618463604,cmv trump is not fit to be the face of america let alone the president,this post is really just relevant to american users but i d like to hear the opinions of anybody outside the country if they do have a say i personally do not understand how people can openly support trump with the vast amount of information out there that definitely does not paint him as a good person i ve seen most supporters say that they voted for him hoping for cheaper gas prices groceries and to make america great again i believe the country has never truly been great and needs much work but that is an entirely different conversation even if i did believe trump could and would do everything his supporters are hoping for i would not vote for him why he was openly a close friend of jeffrey epstein for according to epstein himself 10 whole years there are clips of the two of them talking about women s looks which i doubt their conversations were respectful after the grab em by the pussy comment trump says these exact words about epstein i ve known jeff for 15 years terrific guy it is even said that he likes women as much as i do and many of them are on the younger side i m not saying that trump was a part of epstein s crimes but i would not be surprised if such news were to ever be revealed i am simply pointing out who he has been associated with for example matt gaetz who was said to have paid a 17 year old girl for sex trump has faced similar allegations of sexual assault since 1970 26 different allegations to be exact he has denied all of them but considering the people he is around and the things he has said it is very hard to believe him as just about everyone knows he is a convicted felon america might need the cheaper gas prices we might need the cheaper groceries the walls the need to be great but is it truly worth putting the state of the country into the hands of a felon the hands of a man that has likely touched and hurt women without a care in the world hands that shook with jeffrey epstein no i would truly love to know how anybody could ever choose that just for a cheaper life,0,cmv trump is not fit to be the face of america let alone the president this post is really just relevant to american users but i d like to hear the opinions of anybody outside the country if they do have a say i personally do not understand how people can openly support trump with the vast amount of information out there that definitely does not paint him as a good person i ve seen most supporters say that they voted for him hoping for cheaper gas prices groceries and to make america great again i believe the country has never truly been great and needs much work but that is an entirely different conversation even if i did believe trump could and would do everything his supporters are hoping for i would not vote for him why he was openly a close friend of jeffrey epstein for according to epstein himself 10 whole years there are clips of the two of them talking about women s looks which i doubt their conversations were respectful after the grab em by the pussy comment trump says these exact words about epstein i ve known jeff for 15 years terrific guy it is even said that he likes women as much as i do and many of them are on the younger side i m not saying that trump was a part of epstein s crimes but i would not be surprised if such news were to ever be revealed i am simply pointing out who he has been associated with for example matt gaetz who was said to have paid a 17 year old girl for sex trump has faced similar allegations of sexual assault since 1970 26 different allegations to be exact he has denied all of them but considering the people he is around and the things he has said it is very hard to believe him as just about everyone knows he is a convicted felon america might need the cheaper gas prices we might need the cheaper groceries the walls the need to be great but is it truly worth putting the state of the country into the hands of a felon the hands of a man that has likely touched and hurt women without a care in the world hands that shook with jeffrey epstein no i would truly love to know how anybody could ever choose that just for a cheaper life
1bgukwq,CMV: Dating has become more of a chore than it supposedly being fun ,"Note: I am not American, so I am not basing culture culture off dating in America, but just generally about dating. 

Take a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/s/Eg6c0W7LEn) and you will see how taxing dating has become. 

Dating apps are basically useless for men, even for men who get some matches because women on dating apps aren’t even exactly looking to go on dates, at this point it seems like women are seeking validation and an ego boost from the tons of matches they get. 

The dating standards have become ludicrous at this point, and no, it is not “incel” to point out how the extremely high standards that a lot of women are holding for men is ridiculous. 

That’s the equivalent of me wanting a super model who vibes with me but I can’t even give anything in return. Thats exactly what dating has become now. Women seek men who are in the ‘top percentages’, but what do they provide in return? 

They are problematic and want to be treated like ‘passenger princesses’, and expect men to be both “modern and traditional” at the same time. 

Dating would have remained *simpler* if dating apps didn’t exist, but these dating apps and even social media has completely warped women’s minds because of the tons of attention women get from DM’s, and likes on Instagram and those sort. 

And a lot of the older men who will probably read this post will never understand the struggles of younger men today who are trying to date, because you never grew up in an era where women hold men to such ridiculous standards and even the average men are being seen as disposable and useless. 

At this point why even bother trying to date? Might as well stay single forever, focus on my career, take care of my parents and get a dog.

Change my view and tell me why dating isn’t a chore in today’s age, especially for younger men.

Larian Studios is fairly small, not massively rich, and doesn’t have anything near the resources of the big triple a gaming studios. Those triple a gaming studios do routinely copy other games because creativity is hard and proven success helps. 

As such, they should be looking for lessons from this, we should compare future rpgs to Baldur’s gate, and they have the resources to do anything Larian did well.

190cmeb,"CMV: The Democratic Party platform of ""vote for us or lose the right to vote at all"" is not the strong ""saving democracy"" platform that party leadership seems to think it is.","Note: in this post I'm using ""democracy"" to describe any system of government where power is derived from legitimate elections. The debate about whether our representative form of government was ever a true ""democracy"" is another topic entirely.

The US has long had a two-party democratic system. Now, one of the two parties is openly un-democratic. They support a candidate who already attempted one coup to overthrow an election, and who openly wishes to be a dictator. So from my perspective, that party is no longer participating in the democratic process, which leaves us with a... one-party democracy? Is that even a democracy at all?

In 2020 Biden ran on the premise of saving democracy from Trump. Now, entering the next election, democracy seems *even farther* from ""being saved,"" and Biden is running on the same premise again. Frankly, it seems a lot like the rhetoric from self-labeled but widely accepted to be undemocratic regimes like Russia and China; ""you must vote for THE party or doom us all.""

It seems to me that the only way out of this situation is to create a viable third-party (or rather, 2nd party, if you assume that the Republicans are not participating in democracy).

1ace5gs,CMV: Boneless wings and chicken nuggets are two distinctly different dishes.,"CMV: Boneless wings and chicken nuggets are two distinctly different things.

My buddy and I will die on this hill. My argument is that if you went to a restaurant and ordered boneless wings and chicken nuggets, you would always get two distinctly different dishes. If you went to a restaurant and ordered boneless wings and you received a plate of chicken nuggets covered in sauce you would think to yourself, “hey these are chicken nuggets, not boneless wings.” And you would not be happy that that’s what they served you. 

Chicken nuggets have always been ultra processed shaped “nuggets” and boneless wings will never be processed to the degree that nuggets are. Another part of the argument brings in chicken tenders. If you call boneless wings nuggets, you have to call chicken tenders nuggets too. Granted, boneless wings are not deboned wings.

1ftufds,"CMV: CMV: Within legally recognized marriages, adultery should have clear, civil legal consequences, unless expressly agreed between spouses.","The legal concept of marriage, where spouses act as partners, is almost always built on mutual trust that certain aspects of the relationship, such as sex, are to be exclusive to the relationship unless agreed upon otherwise. Legally and financially rewarding spouses for betraying the trust of their spouse by allowing a cheating spouse to come out ahead in divorce undermines one of the key relationship dynamics in our society.

For the vast majority of people, entering into marriage is an explicit agreement that unless divorced or otherwise agreed upon, the people in the marriage will not have sex with or develop romantic relationships with other people. This should apply evenly to all genders, and if you view this as benefitting one over the other, it says a lot about your view on who may or may not be more likely to cheat.

Before I'm accused of being some kind of conservative or traditionalist: I have zero issue with any form of LGBTQ+ relationship or poly setup. I'm speaking strictly to traditional, legally recognized, monogamous marriages, which comprise the bulk of those in our society. I'm also not religious or socially conservative.

Heading off a few arguments:

1. ""The government shouldn't be involved in marriage""

Too late for that. Marriage is a legally binding agreement that affects debt, assets, legal liability, taxes, homebuying, and other fundamental aspects of our lives. The end of marriage has profound, legally enforceable consequences on both parties. It is also included in a pre-existing legal doctrine of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation\_of\_affections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affections).

2) ""But what if the spouses want to open their marriage?""

Totally fine. My post is in reference to the most common form of marriage, which is monogamous.

3) ""Adultery doesn't have a clear definition""

It does. ""voluntary sexual [intercourse](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=05826a3c56c67289&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1127US1127&q=intercourse&si=ACC90nwZrNcJVJVL0KSmGGq5Ka2Y_LZNCuz-rXf3RWbWGZD0YFuvQ0gck8iv_I-vXEsPMmDpeldPlTyUN0FJ6k9nx2_KAjj_QmEabPxsAQcdvs4E9R8NkyU%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_k-r92u2IAxVAMdAFHaqNGncQyecJegQIOhAO) between a married person and a person who is not his or her spouse."" ""Sexual intercourse"" would include all the commonly recognized forms of sex. This would have to be proven via the typical preponderance standard, which is greater than 50% odds, via typical evidence used to evidence behaviors - depositions/testimony under oath, any written or photographic evidence, circumstantial evidence, etc.

4) ""What should the legal consequences be?""

At the very least, immediate forfeiture of any rights to alimony or spousal support. Shifts in the default assumption of a 50/50 split of marital assets are another route to explore. Certainly not enough to leave anyone destitute, though.

5) ""What about children?""

Child support is a separate issue, as it affects the child, who has no say in one of their parents cheating on the other.",insect_ligaments,654,0.6800000071525574,1145,1727805246,2024-10-01

1jw3hht,CMV: Many Americans have no grasp on reality and it’s largely why we’re in this mess.,"I was talking to my boyfriend the other night about how Americans have become so soft. Now I’m not a conservative by a long shot, I’m very much on the left. But I was talking about how if the civil rights movement or the movement for women’s suffrage had happened today, those groups either wouldn’t have achieved their goals or it would have been *way more* difficult because people just seem so apathetic and uncaring.

This led me into saying that I really think a large majority of Americans have no real grasp on reality. Sure, if you’re in true poverty or are homeless in this country, that’s absolutely gonna suck and will be a horrible and traumatizing experience. However, most people who make an average salary are doing fine. Sure, you’ll probably need a roommate in more expensive areas and I do think that’s an issue, but still… even living with a roommate in an apartment is like… fine (at least to me).

Americans are so landlocked and separated away from any countries that experience *true and intense* hardships, that I really do believe we’ve come to the ideal that not being able to buy what you want all the time is the biggest hardship of all.

I think the amount of wealth that can be gained in this country really messes with people’s perception of what is normal. It’s normal to need a roommate, it’s normal to live in a smaller house, it’s normal to have to budget. But because we see people living extravagant lifestyles, we believe that somehow… through sheer force of will, we could also get there.

I also think it makes normal salaries that are fine amounts of money seem “small.” Like, I make 70k and I live in a large city in Missouri, but it’s really a mid sized city compared to others in the country. I live in a nice apartment building, can pay my rent and bills, and still buy and do things I want every once in a while. But somehow people have decided that 70-80k is still… not that much money?

I think Americans have been sold a lie that we can forgo social services in the name of being a country where you can *possibly, but probably not* make all the money you could ever dream of and more. If we had subsidized healthcare, parental leave, etc we probably wouldn’t feel the need to make over six figures, but people have decided that it’s more important to possibly be able to become a billionaire than to have services that would actually relieve stress and money issues.

Americans don’t want to admit that maybe they’ll be average for their whole lives and that is ruining us as a country.",MissHannahJ,5722,0.8999999761581421,587,1744305936,2025-04-10

1jf9nhx,"CMV: The removal of the article talking about Jackie Robinson's military history on grounds that it was ""DEI"" is proof that the movement is based purely on anti-minority racism.","The Department of Defense removed an article talking about the Army history of sports legend Jackie Robinson on grounds that it was DEI (it had a DEI tag). This is proof that the anti-woke, anti-DEI movement is based exclusively on anti-minority racism, and elimination of non-white societal participation. 

Jackie Robinson is an important historical figure as he broke the color barrier in a major sport, during the Jim Crow era. The sheer fact the people are willing to eliminate the existence of a person of color under claims that it was ""DEI"" is proof that the anti-DEI movement is about the restoration of 1900's era Social Darwinism and avocation of white superiority. 

The removal of Jackie Robinson's military history was only detected and reversed when ESPN noticed it and brought it up. Also highlighting the importance of media in society as a check on government actions. 

The irony of the removal of the discussion about Jackie Robinson's military history is that Jackie Robinson lived in an era where black people weren't allowed to participate in large parts of American society, and now we live in an era where black participation in society is now viewed as ""Affirmative Action"" and ""DEI""

1clrqw2,CMV: future of Islamism in Europe is not promising ,"
I'm ex-muslim and I was worried about what's happening in the last few years where people in the UK chanting for implementing Sharia as well as Germany 

I don't have problems with Muslims just if you want to say I'm islamophobic but I don't want my head to be chopped off because I left my faith for the scientific errors in the Quran which is the word of God 

But I truly believe that stoning to death, killing apostates, cutting hands and doing jihad which is militarily fighting other countries to worship allah and enslaving their women and children and kill men if they defend their land and implementing jyzia to humiliate non-muslims is something bad and inhumane and terrorist 

I think that 1 scenario will happen in the future out of 2 

1. The good scenario 

Europe will organize the immigration policy and the next generations of Muslim will be less conservative and many of them will leave the faith and everything is gonna be fine (most of the ones who want sharia are either 1st generation or 2nd at most) a


2. The bad scenario 

UK will face a civil war from people who wants to implement the Sharia (and yes that's what literally in the Quran, Muslims are ordered to jihad) and eventually the UK will win but after many casualties 


Sorry if that's sounds very extreme but I'm genuinely worried because I'll encounter many persecution if people in my country knows that I'm atheist and maybe I'll be killed if they know and I'm willing to go work in the west and I -for obvious reasons- don't want to be killed there too

172zudm,CMV: Voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all.,"In 2020, only about 2/3 of eligible voters actually voted. According to a survey, of the 1/3 who did not vote, 20% said their reason for not voting was that they did not like the candidates.  
https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/945031391/poll-despite-record-turnout-80-million-americans-didnt-vote-heres-why  
Here is my view: If you do not like either of the main two candidates enough to vote for one of them, you might as well vote for someone else.  
A lot of people say ""a vote for a 3rd party candidate is a vote for (insert name of Democrat or Republican candidate)""  
By definition it is not. It is a vote for someone else. And this argument fails even harder when the voter in question would not otherwise have voted for anyone.  
People say that voting for a 3rd party candidate is meaningless because they won't win. But something interesting happens when a 3rd party candidate gets 5% of the vote. They become eligible for federal funding in the next election.  
https://transition.fec.gov/info/chtwo.htm  
This is certainly not impossible. In 2016, both Clinton and Trump were such immensely terrible candidates that the Libertarian nominee, Gary Johnson, got 3.3% of the vote.  
It's too early to say for sure, but I'd wager both major candidates in 2020 will be astonishingly difficult to vote for.  
So if a potential voter's reaction to whichever two clowns they put at the top of the ballot is to vote for neither of them... why shouldn't they vote for someone else instead?  
This is not to say that an undecided voter should necessarily vote 3rd party instead of trying to figure out which of the major candidates is the 'lesser evil'. My statement is only that voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all.  
In an ironic twist, due to the way the electoral college works, in deep red or deep blue states, voting for a 3rd party candidate may influence the result of the election more profoundly than voting for one of the two main candidates. One vote can be the difference between a major party receiving 88% or 88.0001% of the vote in a particular state... or it can be the difference between a third party receiving 4.99999999% or 5% of the vote nationwide.",LaserWerewolf,433,0.7799999713897705,631,1696773607,2023-10-08 09:00:07,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/172zudm/cmv_voting_for_a_3rd_party_candidate_is_more/,10,2023,0.027677496991576414,0.1511879049676026,0.0894327009795895,cmv voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all,in 2020 only about 2 3 of eligible voters actually voted according to a survey of the 1 3 who did not vote 20 said their reason for not voting was that they did not like the candidates here is my view if you do not like either of the main two candidates enough to vote for one of them you might as well vote for someone else a lot of people say a vote for a 3rd party candidate is a vote for insert name of democrat or republican candidate by definition it is not it is a vote for someone else and this argument fails even harder when the voter in question would not otherwise have voted for anyone people say that voting for a 3rd party candidate is meaningless because they won t win but something interesting happens when a 3rd party candidate gets 5 of the vote they become eligible for federal funding in the next election this is certainly not impossible in 2016 both clinton and trump were such immensely terrible candidates that the libertarian nominee gary johnson got 3 3 of the vote it s too early to say for sure but i d wager both major candidates in 2020 will be astonishingly difficult to vote for so if a potential voter s reaction to whichever two clowns they put at the top of the ballot is to vote for neither of them why shouldn t they vote for someone else instead this is not to say that an undecided voter should necessarily vote 3rd party instead of trying to figure out which of the major candidates is the lesser evil my statement is only that voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all in an ironic twist due to the way the electoral college works in deep red or deep blue states voting for a 3rd party candidate may influence the result of the election more profoundly than voting for one of the two main candidates one vote can be the difference between a major party receiving 88 or 88 0001 of the vote in a particular state or it can be the difference between a third party receiving 4 99999999 or 5 of the vote nationwide,0,cmv voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all in 2020 only about 2 3 of eligible voters actually voted according to a survey of the 1 3 who did not vote 20 said their reason for not voting was that they did not like the candidates here is my view if you do not like either of the main two candidates enough to vote for one of them you might as well vote for someone else a lot of people say a vote for a 3rd party candidate is a vote for insert name of democrat or republican candidate by definition it is not it is a vote for someone else and this argument fails even harder when the voter in question would not otherwise have voted for anyone people say that voting for a 3rd party candidate is meaningless because they won t win but something interesting happens when a 3rd party candidate gets 5 of the vote they become eligible for federal funding in the next election this is certainly not impossible in 2016 both clinton and trump were such immensely terrible candidates that the libertarian nominee gary johnson got 3 3 of the vote it s too early to say for sure but i d wager both major candidates in 2020 will be astonishingly difficult to vote for so if a potential voter s reaction to whichever two clowns they put at the top of the ballot is to vote for neither of them why shouldn t they vote for someone else instead this is not to say that an undecided voter should necessarily vote 3rd party instead of trying to figure out which of the major candidates is the lesser evil my statement is only that voting for a 3rd party candidate is more useful than not voting at all in an ironic twist due to the way the electoral college works in deep red or deep blue states voting for a 3rd party candidate may influence the result of the election more profoundly than voting for one of the two main candidates one vote can be the difference between a major party receiving 88 or 88 0001 of the vote in a particular state or it can be the difference between a third party receiving 4 99999999 or 5 of the vote nationwide

1gx4o9z,CMV: Culling male chicks is the least cruel option after in-ovo sexing,"Several EU countries have banned the practice of culling male chicks because the general population finds it ""icky."" The thing is, factory farming as a whole is inherently icky and culling the male chicks is objectively the most humane way of dealing with the fact that it makes zero economic sense to raise these chickens. Instead of going into the grinder shortly after they hatch, the male chicks are shipped off to live in a warehouse with the absolute worst conditions allowed by law until they're ready for slaughter. So we either kill the chick on day 1 or we kill it on like day 50 after it's spent its entire life inside a windowless warehouse where there's not even enough space to move. Either way, we're killing the chicken and the grinder minimizes the time it has to suffer. 

Raising all of the male chickens also causes a surplus of chicken meat and, since there isn't enough demand for this meat in the EU, it ends up being exported to developing nations and destabilizing their own poultry industry, which will inevitably cause them to be dependent on the EU for food. Without fail, every single time a developing nation has become dependent on wealthier nations for food, it has had absolutely devastating consequences for the development of that nation. So you can't even really argue that ""At least the male chickens are dying for a reason if we slaughter them"" because a) the chickens *literally* do not give a fuck and b) the ""reason"" is to dump cheap meat in Africa. 

Destroying the male eggs before they even hatch with in-ovo sexing is obviously the best option but, as far as I understand, this is still pretty expensive and hasn't been universally adopted. Until the cost for in-ovo sexing comes down, the grinder remains the best option. It would be different if the male chicks were being shipped off to some green pasture to live out their days but this is literally the opposite of what actually happens to them. I would even argue that these bans on culling are a form of performative activism so that privileged Europeans can feel better about themselves while they remain willfully ignorant to the horrors of factory farming.

1jza96b,CMV: Donald Trump should be removed via Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution,"Section 4 of the 25th Amendment states:



""Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.



Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.""



I believe the President's Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office using this section. The 25th Amendment would also give cover to the Senate and the House to determine that the President is mentally incompetent, especially if there is evidence to support it. So it's safer for Congress to use this method instead of impeachment, because they can say that they support Trump, but that he ""lost his mental capacity.""



\*\*I think Congress would also be in their rights to hold votes through secret ballot as well, because they would like to protect their families from retaliation from an irrational President, who has shown a willingness to retaliate against anyone he perceives to be his enemy (\[see the attempted assassination of Nancy Pelosi by a supporter of his attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer in their home\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack\_on\_Paul\_Pelosi)), and who does not comply with the Rule of Law, or Due Process under the Constitution.\*\*



I think this would be a powerful argument because Trump's irrationality is self-evident through his own actions. For example, he is ignoring the advice of experienced experts in the government, he's instituting tariffs and rolling tariffs back, he's not following due process, and he's acting very irrationally. There is an unprecedented attack on our system of government, and there needs to be a determined and legally justifiable response to oust Trump, as soon as possible.



Through the 25th Amendment, the process would proceed as follows:







\- The VP and a majority of the Cabinet write a letter to the Senate President & House Speaker stating that Trump is not mentally competent, and the VP will assume the Presidency



\- Trump writes a letter back, stating that he is mentally competent, and attempts to take the power back



\- The VP & Cabinet write another letter stating that he is not mentally competent, and prevents him from taking the power back



\- The Senate and House must convene within 48 hours and rule by a 2/3 vote that Trump is or is not mentally competent within 21 days, this can be done by secret ballot for the safety of members of Congress







This is a historic moment, and I believe drastic steps need to take place to save our system of government. This is a legal method. :) People need to use their personal and institutional influence to lobby for this to happen, because our systems of government are under attack and we are at risk of losing everything.

1ano790,CMV: Someone should leak “Coyote vs Acme” on the internet,"Warner Bros Discovery produced a Looney Tunes “Coyote vs Acme” film, produced by James Gunn and starring John Cena. In test screenings, the reactions were overwhelmingly positive by the audience. 

But WBD CEO David Zaslav decided that it would be better to never release the film for the company to get a tax off in its earnings. The movie is already finished and it’s just there, getting dust. 

My view: WBD doesn’t want to release the film themselves nor sell it to other studios. With that, it would be perfectly ok (although illegal) for someone to leak the film on the internet, just like they did with “Scooby and Krypto”, a movie that would have had the same fate if not for a leak. 

What would change my view: arguments that don’t revolve around the illegality of leaking and arguments that don’t revolve around “the film is WBD’s property and they should do what they want”.

1csgums,CMV: It’s perfectly acceptable to care about a potential partner’s sexual history ,"It’s no secret that there is a double standard between men and women on this topic. Men’s promiscuity tends to get a pass or even praise while womens’ tends to get cringed at or shamed. 

But I think regardless of gender, it’s not an unfair standard to want a partner that hasn’t slept around a ton. A popular sentiment online is that if I found out well into a relationship that my partner had slept with 50 people, any emotional reaction I may have can only be the result of insecurity. 

Is it inherently insecure to not want a person who is willing to let their body be used by numerous strangers? At the very least I think I’m justified in thinking “ew”, and that doesn’t have to be because of my own insecurity. 

I’m no prude. I don’t think sex is sacred or anything. And you don’t have to agree with my preference, but why can’t this just be merely be a preference without accusations of sexism or “slut-shaming”?

1mg1egx,"CMV: sabrina carpenter is not for the ""girls and the gays"", and her marketing is largely based around men.","okay, hi! the controversy around sabrina carpenter's new album cover inspired me to make this post, and i'll mostly be talking about the sudden switch in her marketing/brand since Nonsense. i'd like to start of by saying that you can argue whether being male centred is good or not, but that's not exactly my point, my point is merely proving that her brand IS male centred, and not for the ""girls and the gays"".

Wikipedia defines the male gaze as the act of depicting women and the world in the visual arts and in literature from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as sexual objects for the pleasure of the heterosexual male viewer.   
  
1. The nonsense outros: all are about men. all of them. all of them are oversexualised. they centre men. it's sexual humour, but all of it centres men. how big he is, et cetera et cetera. moreover, the sexualise outros aren't empowering or subversive either. they're marketable, specifically to the men that she is singing to. it's not empowering because there's less about her sexuality as it is, and more about how her sexuality profits men. which imo makes it obvious that the nonsense outros specifically are male centred. 

  
2. the man's best friend cover (original): while she is the centre of the cover, i'd like to argue that she is the centre of the cover in a voyeuristic way. once again, it's a man's action that is highlighted, i.e, the pulling of her hair. her action, kneeling, is AGAIN in service to the man's action. the title compares her to a dog, direct objectification. how is that not male gazey? 

\-the inside of the vinyl, side A (if i'm not wrong): is once again, her being displayed for a man, she's on a bed, her hands holding the headboard (passive), while a man touches her leg. once again, it's sexualised, but it's not for a woman's pleasure, it's the man who is controlling the situation.



3. Manchild: the only single that's been released off of the album, is once again talking about a man who's problematic, and once again features her centring her life around such problematic men. ""i swear they choose me, i'm not choosing them"" even as a joke, is her being passive. 

  
4. the tracklist for man's best friend: 

1. Tears
2. My Man On Willpower 
3. Sugar Talking
4. We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night
5. Nobody’s Son
6. Never Getting Laid
7. When Did You Get Hot?
8. Go Go Juice
9. Don’t Worry I’ll Make You Worry
10. House Tour
11. Goodbye

and 6 of these titles are very obviously about men, even though they're not released. 

  
5. the short and sweet tracklist: 

1. Taste
2. Please Please Please
3. Good Graces
4. Sharpest Tool
5. Coincidence
6. Bed Chem
7. Espresso
8. Dumb & Poetic
9. Slim Pickins
10. Juno
11. Lie To Girls
12. Don’t Smile

11/12 of these are about men. if we argue espresso isn't about men, that makes it 10/12 songs.

these are all the points i could think off the top of my head. i don't see how someone could look at these examples and then claim that her marketing is for the ""girls and the gays"", just because she had one video where she was depicted as having no outfits for men, and an outfit for the girls and the gays. thank you for reading if you did!

1mzupsm,CMV: Trump is setting the stage to intentionally start a war with Venezuela or Mexico so he can then claim to be a war time president in an attempt to cancel the 2028 elections.,"Trump's moves in relation to Venezuela and/or Mexico are a misguided attempt to imitate Putin and Netanyahu. 

There have been multiple times that Trump and his followers have floated the idea of Trump being President for a third term. He mentioned the idea during a January 2025 Vegas rally ( [https://youtu.be/OXo-XBvMAUQ?t=2465](https://youtu.be/OXo-XBvMAUQ?t=2465) ). Then again during a Feb. 2025 speech ( [https://youtu.be/Vw2AZK5gEok?t=823](https://youtu.be/Vw2AZK5gEok?t=823) ). In March he said that a lot of people have asked him to run again and that, while he's focused on this term he would like to run again and that there are ways around the 22nd amendment ( [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752) ). Even as recently as Aug. 5th he's said he would like to run again ( [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/05/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-president-donald-trump.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/05/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-president-donald-trump.html) timestamp 35:58) There was even been an attempt to amend the constitution as early as Jan. 2025 by Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn. ( [https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/29](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-joint-resolution/29) ) to make is so that a candidate can run and be elected for President up to three times. These are all tests to see how much outrage something like this would cause, how much actual support there would be for Trump continuing as President past 2028, and attempts at normalizing the idea of Trump continuing as President past his second term. Add to all this Trump's 'joke' based on the fact that Ukraine has been unable to hold elections since 2019, “So you say, during the war, you can’t have elections,” Trump responded. “Say, three and a half years from now — so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections. I wonder what the fake news would say about that?” ( [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-live-updates-rcna225477/rcrd86684?canonicalCard=true](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-live-updates-rcna225477/rcrd86684?canonicalCard=true) ) and the actions he's been taking to normalize the use of military force on American soil, like the activation of the National Guard and the Marines in California, the federalization of the DC police force, the activation of the National Guard in DC, and the proposal to send the National Guard into other American cities like Chicago and New York. 

These actions combined make the movement of the USS Gravely, the USS Jason Dunham, and the USS Sampson to the coast of Venezuela, along with his authorization to deploy US troops into Mexico ( [https://youtu.be/povVuY6L6pA](https://youtu.be/povVuY6L6pA) ) to ""fight the cartels"", which could spark a war with Mexico if done without the Mexican President's permission, permission that she has already said multiple time she will never give, seem like the first step in sparking a war with one or both countries as 2028 gets closer in an effort to then use that as an excuse to try and stall or cancel the elections.

1cp7sol,"CMV: After 2010, none of Meryl Streep's performances have been worthy of praise/acclaim, and thus her moniker of the ""Greatest Living Actress"" has diminished.","Her performances in the late 1970's to late 2000's are absolutely banger and are minblowing performances (Sophie's Choice, The Devil Wears Prada, Doubt and Kramer vs Kramer). However, after 2010, all of her performances have been actively hammy and bad. Her performance in The Iron Lady definitely shouldn't have been the one to get her her third Academy Award, it feels like a bad SNL impersonation. She was bad in August Osage County, Into The Woods, Florence Foster Jenkins and The Prom. The only good work of hers was The Post, which was also not up to her usual standards. She was good in the TV show, Only Murders In The Building. 

I feel like people assign her the above moniker purely due to her early work, ignoring the fact that her later filmography has more misses than hits. Thus, her title's effect has been diminished in my view, due to her churning out more bad movies. It also keeps back actors/actresses who have made a few movies and are low-profile, but are consistent and excellent in all their projects.",Fun_Protection_6939,327,0.7599999904632568,157,1715397211,2024-05-10 22:13:31,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cp7sol/cmv_after_2010_none_of_meryl_streeps_performances/,5,2024,0.01608139153265507,0.037437005039596835,0.026759198286125954,cmv after 2010 none of meryl streep s performances have been worthy of praise acclaim and thus her moniker of the greatest living actress has diminished,her performances in the late 1970 s to late 2000 s are absolutely banger and are minblowing performances sophie s choice the devil wears prada doubt and kramer vs kramer however after 2010 all of her performances have been actively hammy and bad her performance in the iron lady definitely shouldn t have been the one to get her her third academy award it feels like a bad snl impersonation she was bad in august osage county into the woods florence foster jenkins and the prom the only good work of hers was the post which was also not up to her usual standards she was good in the tv show only murders in the building i feel like people assign her the above moniker purely due to her early work ignoring the fact that her later filmography has more misses than hits thus her title s effect has been diminished in my view due to her churning out more bad movies it also keeps back actors actresses who have made a few movies and are low profile but are consistent and excellent in all their projects,0,cmv after 2010 none of meryl streep s performances have been worthy of praise acclaim and thus her moniker of the greatest living actress has diminished her performances in the late 1970 s to late 2000 s are absolutely banger and are minblowing performances sophie s choice the devil wears prada doubt and kramer vs kramer however after 2010 all of her performances have been actively hammy and bad her performance in the iron lady definitely shouldn t have been the one to get her her third academy award it feels like a bad snl impersonation she was bad in august osage county into the woods florence foster jenkins and the prom the only good work of hers was the post which was also not up to her usual standards she was good in the tv show only murders in the building i feel like people assign her the above moniker purely due to her early work ignoring the fact that her later filmography has more misses than hits thus her title s effect has been diminished in my view due to her churning out more bad movies it also keeps back actors actresses who have made a few movies and are low profile but are consistent and excellent in all their projects
1ah5ccs,"CMV: For under $50, the single best piece of home gym equipment you can buy is a kettlebell.","This isn’t a big, intense, charged societal CMV. I’m genuinely looking for other thoughts here. But I do think the humble and versatile Kettlebell will be hard to beat.

The Kettlebell and the myriad associated exercises can do cardio or strength. It can be dynamic with swings and snatches, or low impact and static.

It has no moving parts and is incredibly sturdy (I’m talking the proper iron ones, I know the cheaper sand/plastic imitations aren’t as reliable). It takes up a very small footprint.

The big downside would be that you choose a specific weight and live with it for a while. I could see a user hitting a plateau after a time.  But even there I think the kettlebell is dynamic enough where you can feel a certain amount of mastery and fluidity, which will give your workouts greater depth.

Interested to hear about other affordable home gym items folks are passionate about.

**Defining ‘Single Piece of Home Gym Equipment’:** We’re talking about something that is reasonably one ‘thing’ used in a workout.  

So a ‘set of dumbbells’ is pushing the concept, but I’d listen. Because you do sort of need two dumbbells to do alternating curls or other sorts of established dumbbell workouts.

A Jump Rope works. A Box Jump box works.

1fgl7jq,CMV: People tend to treat obese people poorly,"I am a guy and my BMI is 42. So you can get a rough idea of how obese I am.

I feel that people in general treat me poorly due to my obese appearance.

Shop assistants don't really treat me well when I seek their assistance in shops. However, the assistants tend to be friendly to other people (who are not obese) right in front of my eyes.

And buying clothes is a painful experience for me. Many assistants will roll their eyes and say 'No' when I ask them if there are sizes available for obese people.

I also feel that people like refrain from talking to me in social events. I feel like they just talk to me for a short while for formality and try to end the conversation quickly. But I have noticed that they seem more eager to talk to other people (people who are slim). It makes me think that people find me being obese is unattractive and avoid conversing with me. 

I also feel that I get unpleasant stares from other commuters when I try to sit beside them in the public transport. So, I usually choose to stand in the public transport.

1afie1j,"CMV: The Palestinians' fear of getting ethnically cleansed is very real and valid, and it needs to be taken seriously.","It was reported yesterday that 11 cabinet ministers and 15 coalition members of the Knesset attended a conference calling for a ""voluntary migration"" plan of Gazans. Let's call a spade a spade, this is textbook ethnic cleansing. It's no different from when the US ""asked"" Native Americans to move to reservations, or when Soviets conducted population transfers in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. There's no ""voluntary"" here when their homes have been destroyed by the IDF.

The people attended this conference were not some fringe figures as well, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich were both there, they are the Minster of National Security and Minister of Finance respectively. They are also in the war cabinet. Despite the fact that the government has denied these plans, it remains true that these people have real power and real influence in the government. 

When it comes to public perception, the plan is not deeply unpopular or fringe as well. 33% of Israelis support the resettlement and annexation of Gaza and 56% oppose it. Governments all around the world have implemented policies much less popular than 33%, just ask Netanyahu's protestors last year. A proposed policy that only a slim majority of Israelis oppose has a very good chance of becoming actual policy if the political climate changes, even slightly.

If you're a Palestinian, I think it's valid to have fears of being ethnically cleansed from your homes when the climate in Israeli politics is so in favour of such a policy. We need to recognise that and take concrete steps to reaffirm that that's not going to happen, by drawing red lines, or punishing problematic officials, etc.",WheatBerryPie,1063,0.6499999761581421,1608,1706709332,2024-01-31 07:55:32,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afie1j/cmv_the_palestinians_fear_of_getting_ethnically/,1,2024,0.096597746417241,0.38564914806815453,0.24112344724269777,cmv the palestinians fear of getting ethnically cleansed is very real and valid and it needs to be taken seriously,it was reported yesterday that 11 cabinet ministers and 15 coalition members of the knesset attended a conference calling for a voluntary migration plan of gazans let s call a spade a spade this is textbook ethnic cleansing it s no different from when the us asked native americans to move to reservations or when soviets conducted population transfers in eastern europe and elsewhere there s no voluntary here when their homes have been destroyed by the idf the people attended this conference were not some fringe figures as well ben gvir and smotrich were both there they are the minster of national security and minister of finance respectively they are also in the war cabinet despite the fact that the government has denied these plans it remains true that these people have real power and real influence in the government when it comes to public perception the plan is not deeply unpopular or fringe as well 33 of israelis support the resettlement and annexation of gaza and 56 oppose it governments all around the world have implemented policies much less popular than 33 just ask netanyahu s protestors last year a proposed policy that only a slim majority of israelis oppose has a very good chance of becoming actual policy if the political climate changes even slightly if you re a palestinian i think it s valid to have fears of being ethnically cleansed from your homes when the climate in israeli politics is so in favour of such a policy we need to recognise that and take concrete steps to reaffirm that that s not going to happen by drawing red lines or punishing problematic officials etc,1,cmv the palestinians fear of getting ethnically cleansed is very real and valid and it needs to be taken seriously it was reported yesterday that 11 cabinet ministers and 15 coalition members of the knesset attended a conference calling for a voluntary migration plan of gazans let s call a spade a spade this is textbook ethnic cleansing it s no different from when the us asked native americans to move to reservations or when soviets conducted population transfers in eastern europe and elsewhere there s no voluntary here when their homes have been destroyed by the idf the people attended this conference were not some fringe figures as well ben gvir and smotrich were both there they are the minster of national security and minister of finance respectively they are also in the war cabinet despite the fact that the government has denied these plans it remains true that these people have real power and real influence in the government when it comes to public perception the plan is not deeply unpopular or fringe as well 33 of israelis support the resettlement and annexation of gaza and 56 oppose it governments all around the world have implemented policies much less popular than 33 just ask netanyahu s protestors last year a proposed policy that only a slim majority of israelis oppose has a very good chance of becoming actual policy if the political climate changes even slightly if you re a palestinian i think it s valid to have fears of being ethnically cleansed from your homes when the climate in israeli politics is so in favour of such a policy we need to recognise that and take concrete steps to reaffirm that that s not going to happen by drawing red lines or punishing problematic officials etc
1fzi81j,CMV: All transportation should be free out of evacuation zones. ,"Currently there is a massive problem with price gouging by airlines (supposedly now capped...) and it made me think...

If you are under a mandatory evacuation, you should not have to pay to evacuate. You are already likely going to lose your home. You may have no work to return to. You are limited in the possessions you can bring. And now you must also spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars just to leave? 

If an area falls under a mandatory evacuation and you live in that area, the government should be funding all of that. That should be part of FEMA to ensure everyone who has to evacuate doesn't need to worry about how. It would be easier and avoid fraud as well if we just did this up front instead of reimbursing people later. 

You tell the airlines ""there's a major hurricane how many people can you transport out of the area within X time"". Figure out how much it would cost. Create the guidelines for that many people. Do the same with trains and busses. If people are driving out (which should be a last resort because the more people who drive the more people who get trapped) the gas should be freely available. 

Any amount of ""fraud"" in a situation like this would be minimal. People will either pay to travel back or call it lost and stay put or travel somewhere else. You can coordinate with multiple airports/train/bus stations so that people get out of the hurricane zone to designated spots and they can either stay there or they can pay to travel somewhere else.

But they shouldn't have to worry about if they can afford to get out of the initial area.

17p10mg,CMV: democracy cannot tolerate ignorance. Sovereignty for the undereducated is bad for democracy.,"Democracy requires a highly educated electorate; democracy collapses if the people lack advanced education.

It sounds elitist sure, but I strongly believe that it’s true. Popular sovereignty is a nice idea, but an extremely bad one. Literacy tests were certainly abused during the Jim Crow era, but they have well-founded reasoning behind them. 

Demagoguery can really only occur if the population is ignorant enough to believe that the would-be tyrant isn’t lying; or that history repeats itself. 

Take Trump for example. Those who haven’t read primary sources reflecting the rise of the German National Socialist Party might not see the parallels between American populism and German populism. Or at worst, people might not even know what populism is. 

From a policy perspective, the ignorant might think a bunch of government stimulus is a good thing and will never have any negative consequences. Whereas anyone who took high school economics could tell you that inflation will rise as a direct consequence of free money injected into consumer wallets. 

In countries where dictators or oligarchs rule, there is no need for a wise population. In fact, the stupider the better.

1c40sa9,"CMV: I struggle to understand why the crisis of masculinity is even a thing, why so many young men listen to the manosphere or influencers in general, etc. I think it is a case of crisis of independence rather than crisis of masculinity.","The current conversation about masculinity (in the US) confuses me very much, and I say this as a man. I grew up in a fairly stable middle class household, parents divorced in my early teens. I joined the US military at 18, served for a few years, and travelled around the country. After my service I started college and am soon entering my senior year. Why am I telling you all this?

I've always considered myself a highly independent person. I've also figured out a lot of things in my life on my own, to include how to rent an apartment, saving for retirement and amassing decent wealth for my age, entering and being successful in school, having a fair number of romantic partners. By many metrics of modern masculinity, I've done well for myself. But this also leaves me confused as to what men are missing from their lives or what they're having a crisis over.

I've never felt the need to have someone validate my masculinity (as it seems that needing someone else for that kinda defeats the point). Truth be told, ""being masculine"" has never really mattered to me much because its always seemed to be buying in to what someone else thinks is a necessary way to live your life--which returns me to my independence point. The rise of influencers and the manosphere has also seemed to be a weird proxy for mentors in many men's lives, which has always seemed to be a case of being far too online for too long in my opinion. I've also never really leaned on many mentors in my life, but that is probably by own bias showing, I'm sure many people get a lot of guidance out of mentor figures.

This altogether is to say that it seems that this crisis of masculinity is at its core a crisis of independence and men unable or unwilling to figure out their lives for themselves. Perhaps it was the military that ultimately gave me this independent foundation, but I think that proves my point--that it is independence and what it gives you than anything that masculinity is doing for people. The point is not that masculinity is failing or unstable, but that men are unable to be independent and take charge of their independence for themselves. Why, I'm not sure exactly--rent is high and wages are low, but women seemingly aren't having as much of a crisis about themselves these days. Many seem to be enjoying and embracing independence instead.

I'm open to the idea that I'm approaching this from the wrong angle though, happy to hear everyone's thoughts.",mandolin6648,722,0.699999988079071,1406,1713120289,2024-04-14

17jns4u,cmv: the Pro-Palestine cause would be stronger if individuals who were Pro-Palestine would explicitly condemn Hamas,"Pro-Palestine efforts are shooting themselves in the foot by not condemning Hamas. It's making the movement come off as ideological instead of rational as well as ambivalent to human suffering, not unlike the ways in which Israel has been ideological and ambivalent to the suffering of Palestinians. I think, to most people, the very true fact that Israel's treatment of Palestine *explains* the situation is simply not enough to *justify* the deaths of civilians, and that disconnect is hurting the reputation of the free Palestine movement. Hamas has damaged the reputation of Palestine by targeting civilians, and supporters of a free Palestine would rally far more support if they'd communicate, directly and without concession, the fact that the actions of Hamas were morally reprehensible, without concluding that they were ""necessary"" or, in so many words, that ""Israel had it coming."" Unless the majority of Pro-Palestine individuals *are* indeed Pro-Hamas (which I don't want to just assume flippantly because I have no way of knowing whether or not that's true) I don't understand why more people don't condemn Hamas explicitly instead of responding to the attack on Gaza with Pro-Palestine sentiments.

15xjb56,CMV: Having kids is great,"We often get posts here about kids, usually about how awful it is that society expects people to become parents, how having kids is selfish and environmentally unfriendly or how having kids will ruin your life. It’s very hard to respond to these posts because telling people who don’t want kids that kids are great and that they should have them is a bit of a dick move. However, this subreddit is all about expressing and defending opinions, me writing this isn’t about convincing others, it’s about defending a view that’s rarely expressed here.  
Before I explain why kids are great I need to set a condition, it is possible for something to be great whilst still being expensive, frustrating, tiring or difficult. Many great things are one or all of these things, a safari is amazing but costs a fortune, climbing Everest is one of the hardest but most rewarding things you can do and sometimes my wife is incredibly frustrating, it doesn’t mean she’s not the best thing that’s ever happened to me.  
So why is having kids great? It boils down to two main things, one, they’re great fun and two, you get to experience how wondrous the world is through their discoveries. We never stop enjoying play but, as we get older, we get responsibilities and mature, we still like play but we limit how much of it we do and the play we do do we often take seriously. Kids don’t suffer from this, they don’t have our ego, they just want to imagine and pretend and race and climb and build. It’s a pure form of play that adults have often forgotten but we get to experience again with kids. The other day I pretended my three year old daughter could electrocute me. We spent a good 10 minutes of her touching me, me pretending to get an electric shock and her laughing like crazy. It was joyous and wonderful and I rarely experience anything close to it in my wider life, my daughter and I do something like that 5 times a day, it’s incredibly fun.  
The other thing is less obvious. One of the most rewarding things we can do as adults is to achieve something we’ve never done before, the older we get the less this happens. For kids this happens like clockwork, especially early on. Seriously the pride a child feels the first time they pull on their socks is wild and guess what, the parent feels it too. Rolling over, seeing a duck, eating with a fork, catching a ball and don’t even get me started on their first steps, these are all incredible experiences and you experience them along with your child. Children reframe what life is, the most mundane things for an adult are an incredible adventure for kids. Last week I flew with my kids for the first time, I filmed them as the plane took off, it was like we were on the greatest roller coaster ever built.  
Kids give you an experience that is unlike anything else in my adult life and, despite the tantrums, despite the mess and the constant need for attention, that is absolutely worth it. Here’s the other wonderful thing, I haven’t lost the adult stuff either. It takes a bit more work but I get to go out with my friends and do all the kid free stuff I used to, I still have both worlds. Having kids is great, Change my view.

1aqz3a1,"CMV: The gun problem in America is too far gone, and there is no viable solution. The shootings will continue to happen forever.","I live in America. I own 1 gun for protection, and if I had to give it up tomorrow due to an outright gun ban, I wouldn't give a shit. Ignoring the fact that the US government would never in a million years even attempt this in the first place, even if they did, there are millions of unregistered guns that would just stay in the owner's possession and we'd never know.

Then you end up in a situation where all the registered gun owners have now given up their guns, but also know that most of the people they wanted to protect themselves from are still in possession of their unregistered guns, so the now gunless people will just find a gun via illegal means, and just keep it hidden at home. Millions of people will wanna do this, and now there is just a much larger black market for guns, and anyone can get one if they really want one (which they will) and we will be back where we started, where everyone still has a gun that wanted one in the first place.

I also think ""fixing the mental health crisis"" is maybe even a more impossible task. That relies on these people willingly getting help for their problems, which completely flies in the face of the macho ""suck it up or i'll give you something to cry about"" culture that every male has instilled in them growing up, and many have not grown out of as an adult. 

I really see no solution to this, and even if there was one, I think we have too many lunatics that would rather let the problem continue than give up their guns, which is absolutely insane to me.",drippyneon,1212,0.7300000190734863,3111,1707948049,2024-02-14 16:00:49,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aqz3a1/cmv_the_gun_problem_in_america_is_too_far_gone/,2,2024,0.11289793239251723,0.7463402927765779,0.42961911258454755,cmv the gun problem in america is too far gone and there is no viable solution the shootings will continue to happen forever,i live in america i own 1 gun for protection and if i had to give it up tomorrow due to an outright gun ban i wouldn t give a shit ignoring the fact that the us government would never in a million years even attempt this in the first place even if they did there are millions of unregistered guns that would just stay in the owner s possession and we d never know then you end up in a situation where all the registered gun owners have now given up their guns but also know that most of the people they wanted to protect themselves from are still in possession of their unregistered guns so the now gunless people will just find a gun via illegal means and just keep it hidden at home millions of people will wanna do this and now there is just a much larger black market for guns and anyone can get one if they really want one which they will and we will be back where we started where everyone still has a gun that wanted one in the first place i also think fixing the mental health crisis is maybe even a more impossible task that relies on these people willingly getting help for their problems which completely flies in the face of the macho suck it up or i ll give you something to cry about culture that every male has instilled in them growing up and many have not grown out of as an adult i really see no solution to this and even if there was one i think we have too many lunatics that would rather let the problem continue than give up their guns which is absolutely insane to me,1,cmv the gun problem in america is too far gone and there is no viable solution the shootings will continue to happen forever i live in america i own 1 gun for protection and if i had to give it up tomorrow due to an outright gun ban i wouldn t give a shit ignoring the fact that the us government would never in a million years even attempt this in the first place even if they did there are millions of unregistered guns that would just stay in the owner s possession and we d never know then you end up in a situation where all the registered gun owners have now given up their guns but also know that most of the people they wanted to protect themselves from are still in possession of their unregistered guns so the now gunless people will just find a gun via illegal means and just keep it hidden at home millions of people will wanna do this and now there is just a much larger black market for guns and anyone can get one if they really want one which they will and we will be back where we started where everyone still has a gun that wanted one in the first place i also think fixing the mental health crisis is maybe even a more impossible task that relies on these people willingly getting help for their problems which completely flies in the face of the macho suck it up or i ll give you something to cry about culture that every male has instilled in them growing up and many have not grown out of as an adult i really see no solution to this and even if there was one i think we have too many lunatics that would rather let the problem continue than give up their guns which is absolutely insane to me
1mdyofz,CMV: The killing of Corporate Executives (or other wealthy elites) is a facet of class warfare equivalent or lesser than cutting critical services.,"**This is not a post advocating for violence.**

Recently Wesley LePatner, an executive for Blackstone who oversaw a $53 billion dollar real-estate investment fund, was killed by an armed shooter. This attack was less clearly motivated than the killing of healthcare executive Brian Thomson. However it does mark the 2nd high profile executive that was killed in recent memory. 

Currently in the United States, the bottom 50% of households hold less than 4% of the national wealth. A significant portion of which is held by the top of that 50%, because many people towards the bottom of that range have less than nothing, just debt. Many of these people rely on social services like Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, just to survive. 

It's not an exaggeration to say that many of these people's lives are held at the mercy of wealthy individuals' whims. So when someone like Brian Thompson makes a policy choice that he knows will lead to thousands of people to be denied potential life saving medical care, or a real-estate mogul raises rent for the 5th consecutive time knowing families will be homeless, they are aware that their actions will kill people. 

I don't see how the targeted killing of individuals with this kind of power is fundamentally different than someone knowingly taking their lives. The only true difference is that the wealthy elite uses a policy change instead of a gun, and is protected by a few layers of separation. In the end though, both parties are making choices with the full knowledge that it will kill or ruin someone's life.

I'd even argue that many policy chocies made by the elite are worse comparatively, due to the scope of harm caused. Things like cuts to USAID or the NIH will touch the lives of exponentially more people than any individual murder.

1c05z7f,CMV: Religious fundamentalism leads to bad people,"Recently, I’ve been doing a bit of research into altruism and religion. There was a study in 2015 by Jean Decety, since redacted, that claimed that Abrahamic religious children, specifically Christians and Muslims, are less generous, and more likely to be mean to people who aren’t in their own religious sub group. Correcting for errors in data collection showed that actually, children from more rigorous religious households are more likely to be mean to non-members than children from less rigorous religious households. So, right out the gate, fundamentalist children are bigger jerks to non-members. I’m sure this comes as no surprise to anyone on here. We all know the feeling of being looked down on by a religious fundamentalist; they often believe that all non-members are totally doomed, as well as foundationally evil. As these people grow, they seem to get more and more closed off and often bigoted. And just look at all the PURE EVIL these groups can produce. One look at Warren Jeffes and his group shows the tyranny possible with these groups, what

1df8yw4,CMV: Most of the disruptive protests that occur do nothing to change anyone's mind.,"I'm in Chicago.  Not too long ago a bunch of protesters shut down the road to O'hare, one of the busiest airports in the world.  This was protesting the war in Palestine.   Chances are, no one with actual power was being inconvenienced, so all it did was fuck up the travel plans for random people.

1dzaiow,"CMV: Restaurants should have a ""last call"" time in addition to a close time.","I've heard a lot of restaurant workers complaining on the internet about when customers come in a few minutes before close and expect to be served. I understand that the staff wants to go home, but I always found it weird that there is an unofficial window where it's wrong to ask for service even when the business is open.

Restaurants should list two times: one time for when the last order will be taken, and one time for when the restaurant fully closes.

During that window, it should be expected that the staff can clean the kitchen and unused tables in any way that they can while the remaining customers eat. The window should be large enough for a large party to receive their food and have a reasonable amount of time to eat. Once they are past the cutoff, they cannot order anything other than more water.

After closing, their tables and anything else gets cleaned. Hopefully the head start would make that process easier on the staff.

Is this solution perfect? No. Is it better than listing a closing time and expecting customers to be polite and not come in too close to that time?

1awisda,CMV: An airborne strain of Rabies is the most terrifying (and realistic) pandemic scenario imaginable,"Rabies has a 100% lethality rate. It also has an extremely wide window of transmission, as it sometimes takes several weeks for symptoms to begin showing. An entire state or small country could become infected without anyone noticing it was spreading.

During that wait for inevitable death you get Paranoia, delusions,hallucinations, and an inability to drink water due to a heightened gag response.

1gzmh2l,CMV: Lying and exaggerating trumps rhetoric (or any rhetoric for that matter) only leads to more defenders of said rhetoric. ,"What I noticed a lot during this campaign was that people would say “look at what this person said” and you look at their comments and the actual tweet or Reddit post or news article you see is an interpretation of seemingly unrelated comments. I don’t know if I’m allowed to identify a subreddit here but there’s one particular page that is notorious for this. There was a whole thing about how Trump threatened Kamala supporters but he actually said something like “raise your hand actually don’t do that because it would be bad” at one of his rally’s which in reality is not a threat. It’s unprofessional and should not be coming from a presidential candidate but they made it seem worse than it was. The same rhetoric exists around abortion. Labeling anybody anti abortion as someone who wants to control women’s bodies when their reality could be that they genuinely believe it’s murder. I think when you say these things to make someone seem more extreme than they actually are then it makes people see the actual harm they bring to society in a less harmful way. They look like they’re being attacked. I always say, if you believe in something the truth should be enough to convince people Trump said plenty of terrible things and a lot of it is posted on his website.

1armn1r,Cmv: Kids are disrespectful toward the school system because it's disrespectful toward them.,"When I was in school I remember clearly, the overarching message coming from the teachers, staff, the entire school system in general was this: ""We don't care how you feel, we don't care what you think, you're here to do what we tell you to. If you don't do what we want, you're worthless to us."" 

Students who did poorly were often singled out and mentioned by name as examples of what not to be. Students who obviously came from neglectful homes were given no extra help or leniency, they were just treated as failures when they were clearly suffering and not allowed basic hygiene at home. How can you expect someone to get their work done when they don't even have a clean table at home? The students who were treated fairly were the ones who lived in the same subdivisions as the teachers, the ones who live in the neighborhood and who's parents hang out with the teachers as friends. 

There was a clear rift, if you could afford to live in the middle class subdivisions you were worth something and the teachers treated you like a person, if you couldn't afford to live there you were treated with disrespect. Poor kids were seen as a bad influence on the middle class subdivisioners, and so didn't deserve respect. They were always bad right from the start to the teachers. 

There were times I walked up to the teacher to ask for help, and they would stop and make me go away when one of their preferred students would come ask for help, or sometimes refuse to help at all. 

When I see teachers talk about problem students online they don't talk about the factors that cause them, and chock it up to ""lack of discipline.""

1iwnuxk,CMV: MAGA is a scam that exploits the working class,"The “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) movement was never about making America great. It was never about empowering working-class Americans or restoring economic prosperity for those left behind by globalization, automation, and corporate greed. Instead, it has always been a scam—a carefully engineered distraction to stoke resentment, sow division, and keep ordinary Americans too angry at the wrong enemies to recognize they are being systematically exploited.

Donald Trump and his billionaire backers built MAGA on the promise of fighting for the “forgotten Americans”—the blue-collar workers who saw their jobs disappear, the rural communities left hollowed out, and the families watching their wages stagnate while their cost of living skyrocketed. He made them believe their suffering wasn’t caused by corporate greed or billionaire tax cuts, but by immigrants, minorities, liberals, and a so-called “deep state” working against them.

It was all a con.

MAGA isn’t a movement for working-class Americans—it’s a branded identity, complete with red hats and rally chants, designed to make its followers feel like they’re part of something bigger while ensuring they never realize they are being exploited. Instead of helping struggling Americans, MAGA’s real function is to distract, divide, and exploit.

Step One: Exploiting Economic Anxiety with False Promises

From the start, Trump positioned himself as a champion of the working class, promising to bring back manufacturing jobs, stop outsourcing, and put American workers first. But every single economic policy enacted under MAGA did the opposite.
- The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Trump’s signature policy, overwhelmingly benefited the top 1%, giving billionaires and corporations massive tax breaks while offering crumbs to working-class Americans.
- Corporations used their tax breaks for stock buybacks, not job creation, further enriching CEOs and investors while leaving workers with stagnant wages.
- Factories continued closing, and automation expanded, eliminating more jobs—a reality Trump never addressed.

Meanwhile, MAGA supporters pay a higher tax rate than many billionaires. While everyday Americans see a chunk of their paychecks disappear to taxes, billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and even Trump himself exploit loopholes, offshore accounts, and special tax breaks to pay far less than the average worker.
- A firefighter or teacher might pay 22-24% in taxes, while billionaires often pay an effective tax rate of less than 10%—sometimes even zero.
- A 2021 report revealed that some of America’s richest people paid zero federal income tax in multiple years, while MAGA supporters were left covering the cost.

The working class is paying for the billionaire class to get richer—yet MAGA convinces them their enemy is a poor immigrant or a liberal college student instead.

Step Two: Manufacturing an Enemy to Hide Who’s Really Screwing You Over

The genius of MAGA isn’t just in its false promises—it’s in its ability to make its supporters blame everyone except the actual people exploiting them. Every time Trump or his allies betrayed the working class, they fed their base a new villain:
- Immigrants are taking your jobs! (Reality: Corporations are outsourcing jobs and automating labor to increase profits.)
- Minorities are getting all the government benefits! (Reality: The biggest beneficiaries of government subsidies and tax breaks are billionaires and corporations.)
- Liberals want to destroy America! (Reality: Billionaires on both sides profit from division while ordinary Americans struggle with rising costs and stagnant wages.)

Instead of uniting Americans against the people who actually rigged the system—corporate elites, Wall Street, and political insiders—MAGA encourages its base to fight a cultural war against their fellow citizens. If you can convince a struggling factory worker in Ohio that their real enemy is an undocumented immigrant in Texas or a lesbian barista in Brooklyn, they’ll never stop to question why their boss just got a massive tax cut while their wages stayed the same.

Step Three: Suppressing the Vote to Maintain Control

MAGA leaders know that if more people vote, their hold on power is at risk. So instead of winning elections through popular support, they focus on voter suppression tactics designed to keep working-class Americans, particularly minorities and young people, from voting.
- Closing polling places in minority neighborhoods makes it harder for Black and Latino voters—who tend to vote Democratic—to cast their ballots.
- Strict voter ID laws disproportionately affect lower-income Americans who may not have driver’s licenses or easy access to government offices to obtain IDs.
- Purging voter rolls under the guise of “election integrity” often removes eligible voters, forcing them to jump through bureaucratic hurdles to re-register.
- Gerrymandering districts to dilute the power of working-class and minority voters ensures that even when MAGA policies hurt the people they claim to help, the system is rigged to keep them in office.

Trump and his allies spread lies about voter fraud not because fraud is a real issue—it isn’t—but because they need an excuse to justify voter suppression tactics that keep power in the hands of the wealthy. If everyone who was eligible to vote actually did, MAGA would collapse overnight.

Step Four: Keeping Americans Distracted with Endless Culture Wars

MAGA is not about policy—it’s about emotion. It thrives on outrage and grievance because if Americans ever stopped fighting each other long enough to look at the policies being enacted, they’d realize they were being conned. That’s why Trump and his allies keep their base hooked on an endless cycle of manufactured outrage.
- Instead of addressing rising healthcare costs, MAGA tells its followers to be mad about trans people in bathrooms.
- Instead of tackling corporate monopolies and stagnant wages, MAGA wants its base obsessed with whether someone knelt during the national anthem.
- Instead of fixing America’s broken education and job training programs, MAGA convinces its base that the real crisis is “woke” teachers indoctrinating their children.

This is not accidental. The more energy MAGA voters spend fighting these battles, the less likely they are to recognize the real scam happening right in front of them.

Step Five: Keeping the Working Class Down and Powerless

The final piece of the puzzle is ensuring that working-class Americans stay frustrated, poorly educated, and economically insecure—because an empowered, informed working class would be a threat to billionaire rule.
- MAGA Republicans push massive cuts to education funding because an educated population is harder to manipulate with lies and propaganda.
- They work to gut workers’ rights and labor protections because if people had strong unions and higher wages, they wouldn’t be as desperate or easily controlled.
- They fight against universal healthcare because nothing keeps people more dependent on their jobs (and less willing to fight back) than the fear of losing health insurance.

The system isn’t broken—it’s working exactly as intended. Billionaires don’t want independent, secure, well-educated Americans. They want a desperate, divided, easily misled population that will keep voting for the very people exploiting them.

The Hard Truth: MAGA Is a Scam—But Its Victims Keep Defending It

The tragedy of MAGA is that its biggest victims are the ones defending it most fiercely. Millions of working-class Americans, manipulated by fear and resentment, have been tricked into fighting for billionaires who are actively making their lives worse. They cheer for tax cuts they’ll never see, fight for industries that will never return, and defend a system that ensures they remain trapped in a cycle of economic frustration.

And when the next election comes, they’ll be told once again that their real enemies aren’t the billionaires hoarding wealth, the corporations sending jobs overseas, or the politicians voting against their interests. Instead, they’ll be told to blame immigrants, minorities, LGBTQ+ people, college students, and “coastal elites.” And once again, the cycle will repeat—because as long as MAGA keeps Americans angry at each other, they’ll never turn their anger toward the people actually responsible.

MAGA isn’t about making America great again. It’s about making sure the rich stay rich, the powerful stay in control, and the working class stays too divided and misled to do anything about it.

1kazuo6,CMV: The liberal focus on nonviolent protests betrays the fact that most of the successful nonviolent movements existed alongside the implicit or explicit threat of violence,"Note to the admins: This is absolutely not a call to violence. Just an observation.

Anybody who has been to a protest in the US knows that the organizers take great efforts to ensure protests remain nonviolent. There are usually speeches, shouting, marching, etc. I've never been to an organized protest where the organizers did not take great care that we remained civil. The thing is, online and in liberal community projects, there's always the idea of nonviolent resistance held up as a golden standard by which we all abide.

My point of view comes from a few observations:

The first is that our protests lately seem to not be working. There's a rising tide of fascism in the US marked by the erosion of the institutions of democracy, threats to the judiciary, the politicization of civil service, and threats to the free press. Despite the protesting, we've had near-zero effect on public policy.

The second is that historical ""non-violent"" movements were always accompanied by implicit or explicit threat of violence. The US Civil Rights movement was widely known to be non-violent, however it existed alongside more violent groups like the Black Panthers and others. These protests gained moral authority and effectiveness partly because they existed alongside more militant alternatives that made peaceful change seem like the preferable option to those in power.

Other examples would include:

* Suffrage, with women in the movement who murdered opposition, did arson and property damage, and set off bombs
* The US Labor Movement in the early 1900s, where unions would destroy factories and kill the owners on occasion, to gain rights
* The Stonewall Uprising, where trans women threw bricks at police and shifted the movement from primarily accommodationist tactics to more assertive demands for rights
* In South Africa, after the Sharpeville massacre of 1960, the African National Congress formed an armed wing (Umkhonto we Sizwe) while continuing other forms of resistance. Nelson Mandela later acknowledged that this multi-faceted approach was strategically necessary given the context.

Basically I'm saying that nonviolence has historically not always been the answer. I think liberals tend to whitewash the truth to make it more acceptable to the average person, rather than discuss the true history behind some of these movements. I think they've sort of blindly accepted nonviolence as the only solution to an authoritarian uprising in the US and it's not getting them anywhere.

1lffpfd,"CMV: Israel’s attack on Iran was intended to draw the US into war, not prevent Iran from having a nuke","Israel claims its attack on Iran on Friday was about preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. I think that this is a pretty transparent lie for the reasons below.

Israel has been claiming Iran has been close to a nuclear weapon for 30 years. North Korea is significantly less advanced than Iran, but has successfully developed a nuke during that time period. 

Iran previously had a nuclear weapon program. That ended in 2003 to avoid getting attacked by the US. Since then, it looks like it’s strategy has been to use its nuclear capability for deterrence. (“stop fucking with us; we can build a nuke pretty quickly”)

It is clear that Iran does not want a conflict with the United States. Openly weaponizing their nuclear program invites that conflict. 

Of course, they could pursue weaponization in secret. But the US, UK and Israel knowingly misrepresented evidence of WMD prior to the Iraq war. It is more than fair for the public to demand proof of weaponization since one party in this conflict has previously used this exact same lie as cover for regime change.

Israel does not have the ability to inflict significant damage to Iran’s nuclear program or pursue regime change in Iran on its own. Even if they had the capability to destroy Fordow, the enriched uranium is almost certainly spread out across the country. If Iran’s entire nuclear program including the uranium were destroyed, it could still develop a bomb in under 5 years.

The only ways to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuke is convincing the regime that a nuke is not in their best interest or changing the regime. 

It’s still early, but it seems like Israel’s attack has made the idea of having a nuke more appealing to Iranians and the regime. It looks like having a nuke is the only way to deter Israel and its allies.

So why would Israel attack Iran? I think the most straightforward answer is they were hoping Iran would retaliate in a manner that forced the US to enter the conflict and pursue regime change.

Iran hasn’t taken the bait, so now Israel is attempting to present Iran as neutered by their campaign. “Iran is weak. Come over and help us finish the job”

Iran has been weakened, but they clearly have the capability to inflict more damage on Israel than they have demonstrated. The threat of offensive US involvement has constrained their response.

Once the US attacks, Iran will no longer be constrained by the threat of the US joining the conflict and will retaliate on US/ Israeli assets. The US will officially be in an offensive war that it did not initiate. This was Netanyahu’s actual calculation before Friday.

My view can be changed by concrete evidence of Iran’s nuclear weaponization and/or an explanation of how Israel thinks this bombing campaign will prevent Iran from pursuing a nuke without US involvement.

TL;DR: Israel doesn’t have the capability to meaningfully impact Iran’s nuclear program or pursue regime change on its own. They attacked Iran hoping that they could provoke a strong response that would draw the US into the conflict.

nuclear weapon program that ended in 2003 to avoid getting attacked by the us since then it looks like it s strategy has been to use its nuclear capability for deterrence stop fucking with us we can

15p2lws,CMV: The Selective Service System should require both male and female U.S. citizens to register,"The Selective Service System should require all Americans to register, including female Americans, because if male and female Americans have equal rights then male and female Americans should have equal civic duties to the United States. To answer the two most common arguments to this:

Argument 1: What about the biological differences between male and female humans?

Answer 1: Although I do not deny the biological differences, the Selective Service System currently only drafts able-bodied male Americans who pass the physical strength requirements. If female Americans were also drafted, the same process would apply so no one who is not physically capable will be drafted. Therefore, the biological differences won't create an unfair draft.

Argument 2: No one should be required to register.

Answer 2: I completely agree except America’s leaders agree that despite the success of the All-Volunteer Force, registration with Selective Service must continue as a key component of national security strategy. There is no way that America’s leaders would ever allow for registration to end so this is the next best solution for equality and civic duty to the United States.",Miky2025,444,0.8600000143051147,649,1691841072,2023-08-12 06:51:12,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15p2lws/cmv_the_selective_service_system_should_require/,8,2023,0.02888086642599278,0.15550755939524838,0.09219421291062058,cmv the selective service system should require both male and female u s citizens to register,the selective service system should require all americans to register including female americans because if male and female americans have equal rights then male and female americans should have equal civic duties to the united states to answer the two most common arguments to this argument 1 what about the biological differences between male and female humans answer 1 although i do not deny the biological differences the selective service system currently only drafts able bodied male americans who pass the physical strength requirements if female americans were also drafted the same process would apply so no one who is not physically capable will be drafted therefore the biological differences won t create an unfair draft argument 2 no one should be required to register answer 2 i completely agree except america s leaders agree that despite the success of the all volunteer force registration with selective service must continue as a key component of national security strategy there is no way that america s leaders would ever allow for registration to end so this is the next best solution for equality and civic duty to the united states,0,cmv the selective service system should require both male and female u s citizens to register the selective service system should require all americans to register including female americans because if male and female americans have equal rights then male and female americans should have equal civic duties to the united states to answer the two most common arguments to this argument 1 what about the biological differences between male and female humans answer 1 although i do not deny the biological differences the selective service system currently only drafts able bodied male americans who pass the physical strength requirements if female americans were also drafted the same process would apply so no one who is not physically capable will be drafted therefore the biological differences won t create an unfair draft argument 2 no one should be required to register answer 2 i completely agree except america s leaders agree that despite the success of the all volunteer force registration with selective service must continue as a key component of national security strategy there is no way that america s leaders would ever allow for registration to end so this is the next best solution for equality and civic duty to the united states

For example there is hardly a tennis player, who would exchange a major title for an Olympic medal. A lot of the best players typically skip the Olympics anyway. During the 4-year period, there are 20 tournaments in tennis, which are bigger than the Olympics.

Or take football. Would someone exchange an Olympic gold for a Euro cup or a Champions League title? I find that very difficult to believe. Olympics is seen as some sort of glorified friendlies.

I think that inclusion of these sports devalues the status of the Olympic medal and it is really unnecessary as there are more then enough opportunities for the respective athletes to shine outside of the games.

1m1r35k,"CMV: The rise of racial affinity groups (like Black-only spaces, AAPI-only clubs, etc.) is creating more division than solidarity.","So this is something that's been on my mind for a while and I’m honestly a little nervous to post this, but I’m here in good faith and genuinely open to changing my mind.

Lately I’ve been seeing more and more spaces that are race-specific like “Black-only healing spaces,” “Latinx-only events,” or “AAPI-only support groups.” And while I totally get the intention behind it (safe spaces, shared experience, etc.), I can’t help but feel like it’s starting to divide people more than bring us together.

I’m not saying these groups shouldn’t exist. I’m more wondering if they are actually helping in the way we hope? Or are they unintentionally making things feel more separate?

I’ve been in situations where I couldn’t join a convo or event because I wasn’t the “right” ethnicity, and it felt... kinda off? Like I respect the goal, but if we’re talking about inclusion and solidarity, shouldn’t there be more cross-race dialogue together , not in separate rooms?

Also what about people who are mixed race? Or people who feel connected to multiple cultures? Where do they fit in?

To be clear: I’m not trying to downplay anyone’s experiences or say “all lives matter” or anything like that. I just genuinely worry that we’re unintentionally building echo chambers, even within progressive spaces.

1kyairx,"CMV: The Islamic Golden Age was driven by individual geniuses, not Islamic orthodoxy—and modern glorification of it is dishonest","**Note that this text was translated from Arabic to English by AI and I reviewed it and edited some parts too**  
**---**

I've come to believe that much of the praise Arab Muslims today give to the so-called ""Islamic Golden Age"" is misguided. It treats a handful of brilliant thinkers—like Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Al-Razi (Rhazes), Al-Khwarizmi, and Ibn Rushd (Averröes)—as if they were the natural products of Islamic orthodoxy or Arab culture, when in fact many of these scholars were marginalized, persecuted, or even declared heretics in their time by the very religious and political institutions Muslims now revere.

  
My view is based on several key points:

* **Many of these scholars were persecuted**, not celebrated, in their time. Al-Razi criticized religion and was reportedly blinded by mobs incited by clerics. Ibn Rushd’s books were burned, and he was exiled. Ibn Sina was condemned by Al-Ghazali and accused of heresy.
* **Most were not Arabs**, and many weren't even working within Arab-dominated systems. Persian, Central Asian, and Turkish scholars made some of the biggest contributions, often in relatively tolerant courts like the Buyids or early Fatimids—not under the more orthodox Sunni caliphates. Labeling their work “Arab” or purely “Islamic” science erases the diverse and often non-Arab environments that enabled their ideas.
* **Orthodox Islam turned against philosophy and rationalism.** Thinkers like Al-Ghazali (Algazelus) or Ibn Taymiyya  argued that reason must submit to revelation, which helped shut down the momentum of intellectual inquiry. Theologians who attacked science and philosophy are ironically treated as heroes today, while the thinkers they suppressed are also glorified—this contradiction makes no sense to me.
* **Modern Arab-Muslim societies don’t carry on this legacy.** If Islamic civilization truly had a systemic, religiously-driven scientific culture, why didn’t that legacy continue? Why are major scientific contributions today mostly coming from secular or Western systems? It seems to me that the original scholars were outliers who thrived *in spite of*, not because of, dominant religious culture.

In short, the actual drivers of scientific progress during the Islamic Golden Age were not mainstream Islamic institutions but rather individual genius, cultural cross-pollination (Greek, Indian, Persian), and relatively liberal courts. The glorification of this period by modern Muslims often ignores the uncomfortable truth that mainstream orthodoxy largely opposed or suppressed this intellectual flowering.

  
One more thing I'd like to add that wasn't in my original Arabic text:  
It is also worth noting that many of these scholars, received support not from orthodox Sunni sects, but from non-orthodox Muslim groups like the Shi'i Buyids or even early Fatimids \[whom I myself don't support\], these dynasties most of the time provided MORE intellectually tolerant environments and societies that actually valued rationality and science. Again, while I may not personally align with their theology, it's clear as the sun that they actually created conditions in which rationalist inquiry and scientific advancement are accepted and celebrated, unlike the more rigid circles that later dominated Sunni orthodoxy

  
Why I hold this view:  
I believe the Islamic Golden Age is often misrepresented by most modern Arab Muslims. Many of the scientists and philosophers now celebrated were persecuted by religious authorities of their time. Thinkers were exiled or attacked, not embraced. Most weren’t even Arab, and many were supported by non-orthodox Muslim courts, like the Buyids and Fatimids, that tolerated rationalism, while Orthodox Islam later rejected this intellectual legacy.

1mblqmi,"CMV: If you're a centrist, and a leftist being mean to you pushes you to the right, you were always a right winger.","I've been seeing that meme way too much lately with the enlightened centrist standing between the red and blue, and being shoved into the red for some asinine take. This might be unpopular but I don't think the people who spread that meme around were ever centrists to begin with. 

See I'm not ignorant to how mean and judgy leftists can be. Infighting is extremely common for a reason. We all have a lot of conviction in our beliefs and some of us tend to interpret different viewpoints as opposing viewpoints. But that's not what I'm talking about here. Because I've had many shitty arguments with self proclaimed leftists and never once has it encouraged me to take on conservative beliefs. 

I genuinely can't imagine the kind of person who has such little moral fiber that they'd reactively change their beliefs at the first instance of pushback. Hell even after many instances of pushback. Leftists love to debate, so you'd also get many reasonable and compelling arguments from them, even if it's 90% vitriol. It'd be one thing if they just doubled down, but these people are saying they changed their beliefs in opposition to the people they were arguing with. It's hard to believe a legitimately open minded person would only absorb from this experience that 'leftist bad.'

And then you take into account the flaming vile words and actions taken by the right. How did hearing 'jews will not replace us.' on national TV not push you to the left then? Did you really never get into a heated argument with a conservative? I've been called slurs a vast number of times, both online and irl, just for arguing with conservatives.

1b2o53w,CMV: it is impossible to ethically accumulate and deserve over a billion dollars,"Alright, so my last post was poorly worded and I got flamed (rightly so) for my verbiage. So I’ll try to be as specific in my definitions as possible in this one.

I personally believe that someone would hypothetically deserve a billion dollars if they 1. worked extremely hard and 2. personally had a SUBSTANTIAL positive impact on the world due to their work. The positive impact must be substantial to outweigh the inherent harm and selfishness of hoarding more wealth than one could ever spend, while millions of people starve and live in undignified conditions.

Nowadays there are so many billionaires that we forget just what an obscene amount of money that is. Benjamin Franklin’s personal inventions and works made the world a better place and he became rich because of it. Online sources say he was one of the 5 richest men in the country and his lifetime wealth was around $10mil-$50mil. I would say he deserved that wealth because of the beneficial material impact his work had on the people around him. Today there are around 3-4 thousand billionaires in the world, and none of them have had a substantial enough positive impact to deserve it.

Today, there are many people working hard on lifesaving inventions around the world. However, these people will likely never make billions. If the research department of a huge pharma company comes up with a revolutionary cancer treatment, the only billionaires who will come out of it are the owners and executives. If someone single-handedly cured cancer, and made a billion from it, I would say that is ethical and deserved. But that is a practical impossibility in the world today. Money flows up to those who are already ultra-rich, and who had little to do with the actual achievement, in almost all cases.

On entertainment: there are many athletes, musicians, and other entertainers who have amassed billions. I recognize that entertainment is valuable and I do think they deserve to be rich, but not billionaires. That’s just too much money and not enough impact.

Top athletes are very talented, hardworking, and bring a lot of joy to their fans. I don’t think they bring enough joy to justify owning a billion dollars. If Messi single-handedly cured depression in Argentina, I’d say he deserves a billion. There’s nothing you can do with a sports ball that ethically accumulates that much money.

Yes, a lot of that money comes from adoring fans who willingly spend their money to buy tickets and merch. Michael Jordan has made over $6 billion in royalties from Nike. But I would argue that there is little ethical value in selling branded apparel or generating revenue based on one’s persona or likeness. It’s not unethical, but it doesn’t change the world for the better. MJ deserves to be rich but doesn’t deserve billions. I’m open to debate on this.

My general point here is that if you look at any list of billionaires, the vast majority are at the top of massive companies and profit directly or indirectly off of the labor of others. You could say that’s just how to world works but that doesn’t mean it’s right. I don’t think there is any person who has individually contributed enough to the betterment of the world in their lifetime and has also amassed a billion dollars. I am open to any particular billionaires and their work that might change my mind. I also should say that this is a strongly held belief of mine so I would be hard pressed to offer deltas but I absolutely will if someone provides an example of one person who has made a billion that deserves it.",champagne_papaya,687,0.7200000286102295,945,1709171094,2024-02-28

1hettt0,CMV: The New Jersey Drone’s are just mass hysteria.,"People are seeing planes and helicopters, maybe some small recreational drones from hobbyists.

I was really interested in this issue at first, however I noticed a reoccurring theme: nearly every time someone posts a photo or video of the “smoking gun” everyone goes “holy shit!” for the first hour or so. After that, someone figures out it’s an exact match for a helicopter, or a plane that was near the airport. It takes too long for a positive ID, and by the time it’s found everyone’s moved on to the next smoking gun- leading to many threads with the vast majority of comments freaking out about the phenomenon, burying comments that solve what it actually is.


Here’s the thing: I want to be wrong. I want to feel the magic of the drone invasion again.

1lytmfs,CMV: True masculinity is advocating for those weaker than you,"

Growing up I was raised by all women and masculinity was something I struggled with. What is manliness? Working with your hands? Shooting guns? Eating steak? Being a stud in the bedroom? Lifting weights and getting swole? Fighting sports such as boxing or UFC? Cars? Being the provider? 

The list goes on and on right?

Now that I've entered my 30's and started a family of my own, I've really began to reflect on lessons handed down to me as a kid 

One of them was ""Boys lookout for family and protect girls, not hurt them""

I always thought this was a little weird but now I'm wondering if maybe it was tapping into something real and raw and amazing.

We as men should never be bully's unless we are speaking truth to power. Like a person with power who is bullying others deserves to be bullied. (DJT and his goons for example)

Men generally are in a position of power of others. People are less likely to start shit with a man versus a woman. 

We are listened to more than women. When our voice is used to advocate for others, it is taken muchmore seriously.

All of this is touching on the privilege of being a man. Obviously being a man has its downsides and there are drawbacks and issues with how society treats men but it is no question that you are dealt a better hand being born a man versus a woman.

So that said, true masculinity is advocating for those weaker than us. Whether it be disabled people. Mentally or physically. LGBTQ people. Women. Children. Animals. Or literally anyone who would have very little power and is being unfairly targeted or bullied.

This is my takeaway from my 30+ years on this planet. This is what it means to be a man.

1lz40a3,"CMV: Conservative outrage blasting the Superman movie for being ""woke"" due to its pro-immigrant message proves that the anti-woke movement is pure ignorance","The first issue of Superman originally came out in 1938, and was widely credited for single-handedly creating the entire comic-book genre. 

One of the biggest themes when Superman first came out was portraying immigrants as people who could become the symbol of what is means to ne American. Especially due to what was going on in 1938. 

Fast forward to today, and the new Superman movie is being blasted by conservative figureheads for being ""woke"" due to its pro-immigrant message. 

Not even going to touch that Superman has been used as a figure to condemn racism and xenophobia, which is partially what it means to be woke.  Heck within the first 10 years of its existence, Superman was depicted taking on the KKK.

Being pro-immigrant and anti-racist in the 1930's and 40's is super duper mega woke in that era. 

Even going further, in the 1950's, Superman was used in conjunction with black activists to target racism and segregation, with even official government posters as well (partly why Superman and Batman have a No-Kill policies). 

The fact that conservatives are calling the new Superman movie ""woke"", proves that the anti-woke movement is completely based on ignorance at the least, and bigotry and the worst. Especially since they didn't know that Superman ALWAYS had a ""woke"" message.

1gdcgv6,CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round. They are mistaken. ,"Two years ago in the UK, a new front in the culture wars opened up when large posters exclaiming [""Hey straight white men; pass the power!""](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYiLQixX0AEUK03?format=jpg&name=900x900) were spotted in various locations around its cities, as part of a taxpayer funded outdoor arts exhibition ran by an organisation by the name of 'Artichoke' - a vaguely progressive body aimed at making art more accessible to the public at large.

Evidently, the art was designed to generate discussion, and due to its front page news level controversy, on that level at least it was an astounding success: with the intended message clearly being that 'straight white men' have too much power, and they need to hand it over to people who are not 'straight white men', in order to, according to Artichoke's own mission statement at least, ""Change the world for the better"". 

Now this kind of sentiment - that 'straight white men' (however they are defined) are currently in power, and they need to step aside and let 'other people' (again, however they are defined) run the show for a while - is one that seems, to my mind at least, alarmingly common in liberal circles. 

See for example [this article](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/lily-allens-right-white-males-9562356#ICID=sharebar_twitter), which among other things,  claims:

\>""It's white men who run the world. It's white men who prosecute the crimes, hand down the jail sentences, [decide how little to pay female staff,](http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/women-20s-paid-less-men-9560167) and tell the lies that keep everybody else blaming each other for the world's problems""

\>""It's white males, worldwide, who are causing themselves and the rest of the planet the most problems. It was white males over 45 with an income of $100,000 or more who [voted for tiny-fingered Donald Trump to run the free world](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-followed-emergency-kittens-9549099)""

Before finally concluding:

\>""Let me ask you this: if all the statistics show you're running the world, and all the evidence shows you're not running it very well, how long do you think you'll be in the job? If all the white men who aren't sex offenders tried being a little less idiotic, the world would be a much better place"".

And this, at last, brings us to the crux of my issue with such thinking. Because to the kinds of liberals who make these arguments - that it's white men who run the world, and are causing everyone else all the problems - could you please explain to me:

How many straight white men currently sit among the ranks of the Taliban, who don't merely decide ""How little to pay female staff"", but [simply ban them from working entirely,](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-07-07/an-afghan-woman-wanted-to-be-a-doctor-now-she-makes-pickles-as-the-taliban-restricts-womens-roles) among [various](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/26/taliban-bar-on-afghan-women-speaking-in-public-un-afghanistan) [other](https://amu.tv/129066/) [restrictions](https://medicamondiale.org/en/where-we-empower-women/afghanistan) ? 

How many straight white men currently govern countries such as Pakistan, Iran, and Thailand, where the kinds of crimes prosecuted involve [blasphemy (which carries the death penalty), ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68511557) [not wearing the hijab (which again, basically carries the death penalty)](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/16/iranian-woman-dies-after-being-beaten-by-morality-police-over-hijab-law), and [criticising the monarchy (no death penalty at least, but still 15 years in prison)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/thailands-lese-majesty-laws-explained-in-30-seconds#:~:text=Under%20article%20112%20of%20the,majesty%20%E2%80%93%20anywhere%20in%20the%20world) ? 

Or how many straight white men were responsible for ""blaming someone else"" for the problems of any of those [various countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_cleansing_campaigns#2000s) in which acts of ethnic cleansing have taken place, on the orders of governments in which not a straight white man sat? 

Indeed, the article preaches against the thousands of white men who voted for Trump -  ignoring the fact that more [Indians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_2019_Indian_general_election)voted for Modi's [far right](https://jacobin.com/2024/03/bjp-far-right-modi-india) BJP, than there are white men in America \*at all\*!

Now; again, I must stress. NONE of the above is to say that straight white men have never restricted the rights of women, passed overbearing laws, or persecuted minorities. Of course they have; but surely it is more than enough evidence to show that NONE of those behaviours are exclusive to straight white men, and so simply demanding straight white men step down and ""Pass the power!"" is no guarantee of a progressive utopia-  when so many countries not run by straight white men are \*far\* from such? Moreover; does it not also suggest that ideology is NOT dictated by race, and therefore asserting that we can judge how progressive -or regressive- one's politics are simply by skin tone is ludicrous? 

Indeed, the whole idea that 'straight white men' exisit as a political collective at all seems frankly baffling to me; many liberals ironically seem to know the difference between Bernie Sanders/Jeremy Corbyn and Donald Trump/Boris Johnson (delete as nationally applicable) very well, and if straight white men do act in such a collevtive spirit, as liberals often allege, then how in high heaven did England have a series of [vicious civil wars, driven in part by religious sectarianism,](https://www.britannica.com/event/English-Civil-Wars) at a time when nearly every politician in the country was straight, white and male?!

Indeed; while we're back with the UK - even if all such people did step down, and hand over their power, we would still find a great deal of conservatism in the ranks of our politics; we may even find non white MPs standing up and demanding the [recriminalisation of homosexuality](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law), or even [persecution for apostasy.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34357047) Yes, many ethnic minorities are more likely to vote for ""progressive"" parties (Labour in the UK, the Democrats in the US), but this clearly does not translate to political progressivism on their own individual part. 

Now, a counter argument to my view here may be; ""But are you not cherry-picking the worst examples? Why do you not look at those non-white societies which, presently or historically, have been more progressive?"".

And I concede; ancient India may have been more accepting of homosexuality and gender fluidity than was the norm in (white) Europe - as were several Native American nations. But this too ignores the fact that, as today, non white societies in the past also ran on a spectrum of progressive to conservative: certain Native American societies might well have been gender egalitarian, even matriarchies - but many of the Confucian states in East Asia (particularly China) were perhaps even more patriarchal than was the norm in Europe. Indeed, they were certainly as apt at [warfare](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/atrocity-and-genocide-in-japans-invasion-of-korea-15921598/7EFEAB40BC9D61D2F9E92CF8C506FB70), [genocide, ](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/qing-extermination-of-the-zunghars/6D038CADD0F808459451175C1CAD6DC5)and [ethnic persecution.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/viet-nam-and-the-genocide-of-champa-14701509/6E8490A4C5670883A94DAD24BF5C899A)

All of which is to say, finally reaching my conclusion, in which (I hope!), I have effectively stated my case:

History, foreign politics, and even the attitudes of minorities within 'white' majority countries all suggest that there is no correlation between skin tone and political belief - and it is FAR MORE important to listen to what people actually believe, rather than lazily assume ""Oh, you have X skin tone, therefore you must believe Y, and surrender your power to Z who will make the world a better place than you"". 

Again, the argument I am making here is NOT that there should be \*only\* straight white men in politics, or that non white men are inherently \*worse\* at politics - I am well aware that there are many extremely progressive POC, as there are many extremely progressive white men. 

Rather, I argue exactly the opposite; that liberal identity essentialism is entirely in the wrong, and no one group of people are any inherently more progressive or conservative than any other - thus, simply removing one group from power is no guarantee of achieving progressive causes.

1hln8gs,CMV: Republicans will hold a permanent Senate majority for the foreseeable future,"In recent years, the red state–blue state polarization has become more and more locked in. We are now at a point of having no Democratic Senators from red states (and one Republican from a blue state, Susan Collins in Maine). At the moment, there are 24 safe red states, 18 safe blue states, and 7 swing states. This gives Republicans a baseline of 48 Senators, and it means the math no longer works for Democrats. They must hold 12 of 14 swing state Senate positions at once to make it to 50, which would be broken by the Vice President only if Democrats hold presidential office. It just doesn’t add up for Democrats. Barring Texas, Florida, Ohio pipe dreams, Democrats are simply not competitive in any red state.

Obviously, this cripples any Democratic presidents in the near future and weakens the party nationally, as even winning the presidency will not allow Democrats to make any legislative progress since they cannot hold the Senate as well. This further strengthens Republican dominance, as they are the only ones who can get anything done.

The resistance of the national Democratic Party to change and its unwillingness to upset corporate donors and interested groups seems to only cement this and shut down future arguments about how parties adapt—they don’t WANT to adapt.

1hbydut,"CMV: Taxation is not theft. In fact, it is more akin to a modest admission ticket to participate in the economy.","I think a lot of people get their paycheck and see tax deductions and feel robbed. Like what do you mean my yearly salary is not actually how much I take home?"" Right? Libertarians make the the saying ""taxation is theft"" their rallying cry, often arguing that no taxation is acceptable, and the government should essentially disband or be at least decimated. 

I think this argument is intuitive to a lot of people because it does not feel like the benefits we get out of our tax dollars is not as valuable to us as the money would have been. When the average person thinks about how tax dollars benefit them they probably think about roads and maybe the mail or schools but not much else unless they receive government benefits like Medicaid or SNAP. In fact, the ways the government helps poor people are a lot more visible than the ways the might help everyone else. When poor people are essentially getting a monthly check from the government every month, I think it's easy for the average person to conclude that taxes are basically a scam to transfer money from working people to bums who don't work. 

But I think the benefit of tax dollars for the average American are actually much greater than we see at a glance, and the average American benefits from taxation far more than they lose because the government creates and manages the economic conditions that allow us to earn so much in the first place. 

Let's say you're a car salesman at a Toyota dealership. That dealership exists because cheap, safe trade is possible with Japan. This safe free trade is facilitated by the US military, which supports the defense of allies like Japan that could be invaded by China if the US were not an ally. If Japan were at war with China, the country might be blockaded, embargoed, or sanctioned by China in ways that make exports more expensive. Japan would also have to devote tremendous resources to their war effort. Domestic labor would be shorthanded and car manufacturing might have to be converted for war machines. If it were possible to get Toyota cars out at all, they would be more expensive. If China won the war they might impose trade restrictions on Japanese cars to the US to support its own vehicle industry. Also keep in mind the Japanese car industry only exists because the United States supported Japan's economic recovery after WW2 (with taxes), which created the Japanese economic miracle, which allows them to keep producing cheap cars. This relationship with Japan is only possible because the US won WW2 (with tax dollars). 

Imagine if FDR had been a penny pinching libertarian. He might have gone to war with Japan but would he have converted US industry to the extent necessary to win the war? Would he have raised taxes to fund the war effort if taxes are inherently theft? Or would he have negotiated for peace the moment he could secure non-aggression with Imperial Japan? Libertarian Truman certainly would never have approved funds to help Japan's economy recover. Libertarian FDR/Truman probably means no winning WW2, no Japanese economic miracle, no cozy trade relationship, which means no cheap cars in 2024. 

Your job selling cars at Toyota exists because of decisions made by the government 80 years ago supported by a tremendous tax burden, and tax dollars continuously spent to support that status quo. And besides you, customers benefit from cheap reliable cars. And the government collects tax revenue on the sales to make up for its expenses. This whole industry that benefits us all would not exist without the government spending money. This is how economies grow and create more wealth overall than existed before taxation.

While Toyota cars are maybe an easy example, there are so many other ways the government upholds the economy, such that this reasoning can apply to any job. Domestic cars? Made with imported steel and exported for profit that allows the company to grow and employ more people. Work at Walmart? Full of cheap imported goods. Bank? Insured by the government. Library? Government. Law? All about the government. Farm? Subsidized by the government. Healthcare? Majorly bloated with employees bc of the government. 

All of this is not to say that the government is perfect or that you should be ""thankful."" I am just arguing that we should recognize that the government is a necessary institution that requires taxes to work. Every day millions of Americans drive to work in Toyota cars on roads built and maintained by the government, kept safe by the government, to work in industries supported by the government, buy goods and services kept cheap by the government, and send their kids to schools provided at no cost by the government and wonder where all their tax dollars are going. Your tax dollars are all around you mate. 

And I know a lot of people are going to say this can all still exist with a free market and no government, but we have never seen that happen in the real world. Imagine what no government truly means. You would have to pay a toll of some sort to use a road if you did not build it yourself. You would have to pay a regular fee for police and fire protection. Your employer would not be required to provide healthcare, a bare minimum salary, or safe working conditions. You would be nickel and dimed at every turn so often that it would be just as bad as paying taxes or worse. And that's only assuming the inevitable corporate monopolies play nice and do not decide to simply enslave you. If a libertarian utopia were possible I just think it would have been accomplished by now. 

There are already places on earth in which there is no government. Haiti's government has collapsed. If you hate the government you can just move there. But it's a gang-controlled hell hole and nobody has the power to stop it except governments. People there are desperate. They would work for pennies to make iphones or flip flops or whatever but nobody can build a factory there because it would be taken over by gangs. Governments create order which creates economies which create wealth. You cannot have the economy and wealth without the government. All the government asks is a small fee in the form of taxes. 

Taxation is not theft, it is a small admissions fee to enjoy the robust, lucrative economy created and maintained by the government. Again, not perfect, but far better than the alternative. The lie that taxation is theft was created and circulated by rich people who know that less government means more power for them. 

Sorry, I have never taken a single economics class. I am guessing this is some economics 101 shit that economists have already extensively fleshed out. But I am a humble non-economist who does not possess the mental bandwidth to get up to speed sophisticated macroeconomic debates.

1hi0od9,CMV: Elon musk having as much power as he does is one of the most deplorable things to ever happen in america.,"This is obviously a subjective opinion. Just want to start by saying that. Im also aware Elon musks companies have provided great value to Americans. The fact that he has essentially infiltrated the American government to the point he is being suggested for speaker of the house is probably the most insane thing I’ve ever witnessed.

It is a textbook example of the worship of the wealthy and the unrestricted power of money in the US government. I find it absolutely insane that he can actually sway government officials including the president when he knows nothing about the average American outside of twitter. In a proper functioning government, what he’s done so far would be illegal. 

I don’t even see what his goal is , he’s as rich as he can get, he has more power than 99.9999% of humans on earth. He is treated like a super genius visionary by many. I mean what the hell else can he get?

The guy is insane. Anyone supporting him is insane. This is a disgrace to the human population and to the US. Genuinely ridiculous and deplorable system.   

My view is billionaires(elon musk in this case) should never in a million years have the amount of influence over the political system that he does right now.

1kenjwy,CMV: the left is far too soft on Islam,The left is far too soft on Islam despite the implications of it continuing to grow in the West. I think the reason is because the people who believe in it are brown. The people who believe in it are immigrants. But these same people want to remove rights from gays and women. They want to force teaching of their Stone Age idiotic religion. They want to influence our politics. I see no issue with wanting this ideology gone. I see no issue with people being extremely against it. There’s a reason why so many gays supported the AFD in recent election.

1ager2s,CMV: hunting meat is more ethical than buying it from a grocery store,"Inspired by someone talking about how hunters creep them out because ""why do you want to kill an animal/ watch it die when you can just buy it from the store?"" and they were implying that its like something psychopaths do. I don't hunt but honestly I think its way less ethical to buy from a store than to hunt for yourself. The meat industry has a huge impact on global warming, it takes up massive amounts of land, and most animals live and die in horribly cruel circumstances. I am not innocent of buying meat from the grocery store, but I only eat meat about once every two weeks and try to treat it like a luxury instead of an every day food.  

I mean, even from an animal rights standpoint, what is better? an animal living its life in nature, with plenty of land to roam, or stuck in a tiny poo covered pen and only fed corn? It reminds me of that Parks and Rec episode where Ron brings a pig to slaughter for a family BBQ. There was gonna be a dead pig either way, slaughtering it in front of you only reminds you that at one point it was a live animal. 

I don't think trophy hunting is really justifiable. But hunting for food is a lot more ethical than buying it at a grocery store.

1gty4bv,"CMV: Americans and people in the West's criticism of Netanyahu is for the ""wrong reasons"", and would have been the same if any other Israeli was in charge","Israelis hate Netanyahu, but not because of the reasons Americans/people in the world despise him. Israelis hate Netanyahu because he is a corrupted megalomaniac with a god complex, not because of ""war crimes"" or because of his tough stances on Palestinians. In fact most Israelis dislike the Palestinians (especially after Oct7) and share the tough stances on them. 

Even when Netanyahu goes, Israelis still won't support a 2SS (Most of the opposition opposes it), the War will continue and in fact, all of the criticism about Netanyahu for his management of the War and the genocide remarks would have been the same even if Lapid or Yair Golan were in charge, because when it comes to the War and Oct7, most of Israelis are pretty united. (While they are divided when it comes to the Hostage deal, the global Ceasefire now crowd is using the hostages to push a prominent ceasefire that will keep Hamas in power and end the War, while Israelis who want the hostage deal still want Hamas destroyed and to continue the war after the deal)

The Western left who considers themselves as Pro-Israel and anti-bibi, wants Netanyahu gone because they see him as an ""obstacle"" to the 2 State solution (That nowadays no Israeli and no Palestinian support).

16tscm2,CMV: I think inceldom is simply an extension of our society's current relationship with personal responsibility,"As opposed to being directly caused by various forms of sexism. Sexism is obviously present in incel communities, but the state of inceldom would still exist absent sexism.

The basic logic:

'I want to have sex with people' --> 'I have not been able to have sex with people' --> 'This is because of various factors outside of my control' --> 'Society should change because this is unfair'

In this case, the change incels would like to have happen is the gender they are attracted to (usually women) should change their standards so that the incels could have sex.

\------

This logic is consistent with other aspects of our society as well:

\- 'I should not have to lose weight, instead society should change their standards of beauty' (and also airlines should increase the size of their seats to accommodate me so I'm more comfortable)

\- 'Something someone said offended me, and therefore it is bad. Rather than just not consume the content anymore, the person should change'

\- 'I was triggered by something someone said. Anything that triggers me is bad. Rather than manage my emotions, the trigger should no longer exist.'

&#x200B;

\------

Finally, I think while there would certainly still be critics, if the issue of incels being associated with a protected class were removed, it would be much more acceptable in mainstream society.

EG - 'White women are often scared of black men for no reason, thus it is unfairly difficult as a black man to establish romantic relationships'. The logic is the same, including the sense that the black man is ""owed"" romantic relationships common in inceldom, but this is much more palatable to modern society than incel culture is.

Thus, it isn't the base logic and reasoning society finds so distasteful; Rather it's the association with white men. A class that is seen as having the most privilege complaining that things aren't fair isn't going to win over a lot of people.

&#x200B;

\--------

Things that would likely change my view:

\- Explain how my understanding of incel culture is completely wrong

\- Explain how there is no valid relationship between incels lack of personal responsibility and the examples I listed; Besides claiming one is less moral/acceptable than the other. Explaining how the examples can be rationalized or are more just wouldn't really address the main point.",ZeusThunder369,259,0.7699999809265137,381,1695840109,2023-09-27

17llow9,"CMV: Conservatives do not, in fact, support ""free speech"" any more than liberals do.","In the past few years (or decades,) conservatives have often touted themselves as the party of free speech, portraying liberals as the party of political correctness, the side that does cancel-culture, the side that cannot tolerate facts that offend their feelings, liberal college administrations penalizing conservative faculty and students, etc.

Now, as a somewhat libertarian-person, I definitely see progressives being indeed guilty of that behavior as accused. Leftists aren't exactly accommodating of free expression. The problem is, I don't see conservatives being any better either.

Conservatives have been the ones banning books from libraries. We all know conservative parents (especially religious ones) who cannot tolerate their kids having different opinions. Conservative subs on Reddit are just as prone to banning someone for having opposing views as liberal ones.  Conservatives were the ones who got outraged about athletes kneeling during the national anthem, as if that gesture weren't quintessential free speech. When Elon Musk took over Twitter, he promptly banned many users who disagreed with him. Conservatives have been trying to pass ""don't say gay"" and ""stop woke"" legislation in Florida and elsewhere (and also anti-BDS legislation in Texas to penalize those who oppose Israel). For every anecdote about a liberal teacher giving a conservative student a bad grade for being conservative, you can find an equal example on the reverse side. Trump supporters are hardly tolerant of anti-Trump opinions in their midst.

1m5xlfs,CMV: Most complaints from older women about feeling “invisible” to society are simply beautiful women experiencing the natural process of aging.,"I remember watching the first season of the Golden Bachelor with my gf at the time and listening to the different female contestants on the show talking about their experiences as women “past their pretty years” and how they feel society ignores them. But not just them, I work in a  career field with a lot of women and I’ve overheard scattered bits and pieces from others women discussing similar problems. 

If you’ll allow me to paraphrase a somewhat famous aphorism that goes “To those with privilege, equality often feels like injustice”, I feel like that’s very applicable here. Older women, like women in general, deal with a lot of poor treatment from men who don’t respect or understand the aging process. And historically men’s investment in women they’re not related to decreases in proportion to their age and attractiveness. 

But the experience of being unseen isn’t  unique among older women nor would I argue is it even the objectively worst part of dating. To put it crudely, these women had the luxury of being one of the prettiest people in the room from their childhood to at least their mid 40’s. Now, they’re starting to get treated like the rest of us average folk, men and women alike. 

That’s not unfairness that’s just a leveling of the fields. Compare that with the experience of average men/women as they age. They start out not getting noticed and then as they age, they get truly invisible. It’s even worse for the ugly ones. Men don’t care and women still have the threat of sexual assault hanging over their heads for the rest of their lives so they’re even less likely to see or try and see those men either.

Strange, ugly men weeping or looking sad in the streets attract less sympathy on the whole then any lady. It’s why it’s far more common for homeless women to receive help and *not* be seen on the streets as opposed to homeless men. 

As a final point, I’d just say that the women who feel invisible aren’t invisible in the ways average people are. They’re invisible relative to a beautiful girl half their age in the same room, but relative to their generation and age group, they’re still beautiful and have access to a form of pretty privilege that average or ugly seniors can/will never have.

1bapzpn,CMV: Most people in the US are completely deranged about sex and nudity,"The title speaks for itself really, but to elaborate:

* Most Americans have negative overreactions to sex and nudity that are disconnected from any potential harm.
* While sex and nudity can cause harm, e.g. a flasher is sexually harassing people, not everyone who is nude is a flasher. Being able to differentiate nonsexual nudity from sexual nudity and from someone using nudity to harass is a skill most Americans lack.
* This lack of differentiation then gets scaremongered into overreactive policies and everyone being accused of being a sexual predator, in a similar way to 9/11 lead to random innocent people being accused of being terrorists and security theater becoming the norm, with the usual preoccupation with protecting 'normal Americans' from outsiders via norms and propriety - ""we don't do that here"" - rather than real harm reduction focused on real threats.
* Children are as usual weaponized as an excuse to police the actions of others, instead of teaching children age appropriate lessons about sex and nudity to prepare them for public life.
* Not talking openly about sexuality nor educating people beyond the mechanics of sex leads to many Americans not understanding what their own sexuality is and being unable to understand sensual, sexual or romantic expression and how these interact with the public realm.
* This becomes a cultural vicious circle: people are told nudity is bad, told that it's not normal, so they don't expect it, so they feel surprised and scared by it, so they feel it's bad.
* Younger Americans are often additionally hamstrung by absorbing discourse around private sexual consent that does not include the public sphere, leading them to think that they can 'not consent' to other people doing things they don't want to see. Combined with young people's general distaste for older bodies, this becomes ""that old person is creepy"" as code for accusing them of sexual harassment.
* Some in the US kink communites have tried to assuage the fears of the average American, unfortunately lending them further confidence that they are correct because the kink community 'agrees' with them, ignoring that this came from pragmatism.
* The US rightwing are even more poisonous with their fears about sexuality, even going so far as thinking dancing in public is evidence of pedophilia if they think the dancing is too sexy (or black).
* People in other countries are also just as bad as the US or worse; this post isn't saying *only* the USA has issues with puritanism.

1ihplop,cmv: Pro-lifers that carve out exceptions for rape are morally inconstant.,"I would like to start by saying that this is not a pro-life vs pro-choice post. That's not the point of this CMV, so I won't be engaging with the comments that are arguing for/against pro-life.

In the discussions on reddit about abortion, you'll often see pro-choicers demonize pro-lifers for not carving out exemptions  for rape when they are discussing their views. You'll see pro-choicers justify their view by saying that someone shouldn't carry their rapists baby. This is a completely fair view with in the context of bodily autonomy. The problem is that this view doesn't matter in the context of ""all human life has some inherent value"" the way that pro-lifers believe.

The life of someone who was conceived by rape isn't any less valuable than the life of someone who was conceived in some other manner.

Get Polynesian Tattoos? Go for it. 

Wear Cowboy Hats? Why not.

1adbv86,CMV: university quotas are actively discriminating against men.,"In our current higher education system (in most of the western world), there are quotas implemented ""to make sure that historically underrepresented groups get access to higher education"".

The admissions process works by taking an unbiased entrance test, after which candidates are ranked, based on how they did on that test.

1h2li68,CMV: Authors Have No Obligation to Make Their Fiction Morally Perfect,"I’ve seen criticism directed at J.K. Rowling for her portrayal of house elves in Harry Potter, particularly the fact that they remain slaves and don’t get a happy ending. I think it’s completely valid for an author to create a grim, imperfect world without feeling obligated to resolve every injustice.

Fiction is a form of creative expression, and authors don’t owe readers a morally sanitized or uplifting narrative. A story doesn’t have to reflect an idealized world to have value it can challenge us by showing imperfections, hardships, or unresolved issues. The house elves in Harry Potter are a reflection of the flawed nature of the wizarding world, which itself mirrors the inequalities and blind spots of our own society.

Expecting authors to “fix” everything in their stories risks turning fiction into a checklist of moral obligations rather than a creative exploration of themes. Sometimes the lack of resolution or the depiction of an unjust system is what makes a story compelling and thought-provoking.

Ultimately, authors should have the freedom to paint their worlds as grim or dark as they want without being held to a standard of moral responsibility.

1ki79g9,"CMV: Universities are not making students liberal. The ""blame"" belongs with conservative culture downplaying the importance of higher education.","If you want to prove that Universities are somehow *making* students liberal, the best way to demonstrate that would be to measure the political alignment of Freshmen, then measure the political alignment of Seniors, and see if those alignments shifted at all over the course of their collegiate career. THAT is the most definitive evidence to suggest that Universities are somehow spreading ""leftist"" or ""left-wing"" ideology of some kind. And to my knowledge, this shift is not observed anywhere.

But yeah, ultimately this take that Universities are shifting students to the left has always kind of mystified me. Granted, I went to undergrad for engineering school, but between being taught how to evaluate a triple integral, how to calculate the stress in a steel beam, how to report the temperature at (x,y,z) with a heat source 10 inches away, I guess I must have missed where my ""liberal indoctrination"" must have occurred. A pretty similar story could be told for all sorts of other professions. And the only fields of study that are decidedly liberal are probably pursued largely by people who made up their minds on what they wanted to study well before they even started at their University.

Simply put, never have I met a new college freshman who was decidedly conservative in his politics, took some courses at his university, and then abandoned his conservatism and became a liberal shill by the time he graduated. I can't think of a single person I met in college who went through something like that. Every conservative I met in college, he was still a conservative when we graduated, and every liberal I met, he was still liberal when we graduated. Anecdotal, sure, but I sure as hell never saw any of this.

But there is indeed an undeniable disdain for education amongst conservatives. At the very least, the push to excel academically is largely absent in conservative spheres. There's a lot more emphasis on real world stuff, on ""practical"" skills. There's little encouragement to be a straight-A student; the thought process otherwise seems to be that if a teacher is giving a poor grade to a student, it's because that teacher is some biased liberal shill or whatever the fuck. I just don't see conservative culture promoting academic excellence, at least not nearly on the level that you might see in liberal culture. Thus, as a result, conservatives just do not perform as well academically and have far less interest in post-secondary education, which means that more liberals enroll at colleges, which then gives people the false impression that colleges are FORGING students into liberals with their left-wing communist indoctrination or whatever the hell it is they are accused of. People are being misled just by looking at the political alignment of students in a vacuum and not considering the real circumstances that led to that distribution of political beliefs. I think it starts with conservative culture.

16m25zs,CMV: Far-left “tankie” media is harmful to democracy.,"I know the word “tankies” has had a lot of meanings throughout history. For the purposes of this post it refers to the modern way it’s commonly used, i.e. far-left “anti-imperialists” who tend to hate the nebulous West. 

I’m talking about the Grayzone/Multipolarista types, the Max Blumenthals, Ben Nortons, and their ilk. To them, the concept of democracy is secondary to the demise of Western power. 

They present themselves as anti-imperialists because they ostensibly support the liberation of smaller “global south” nations under the grip of global hegemony. Now, I’m all for anti-imperialism in principle, every country should have the maximum amount of self determination possible to shepherd their people into as prosperous a future as possible without some big power boot on their neck. 100%. 

The problem I have with tankies in this context is that anti-imperialism should be pro-democracy. But that is not what’s emanating from these circles. 

In practice, what it looks like is simply being anti-West. If the US, Europe, or their allies are in *any* way even tangentially involved in some geopolitical conflict or dispute, it doesn’t matter what the conflict is, or where it is, or what the motivations are, or who is involved, or what they are doing, the other side is *always right* to these people. 

They seem to giddily support all manner of autocratic brutality as long as it is done in the service of damaging the West’s influence in the world. Everything is a zero-sum game, and the West must never win it no matter what the cost. 

They deny atrocities and push any manner of conspiracy theories (White helmets being false flag terrorists. China not committing atrocities against Uyghurs, no chemical weapons use in Syria, etc.) that would put their favorite dictators in a bad light and, by extension, advance the Western position. 

Look at Syria, Russia, China, Venezuela, Cuba, etc. There is seldom even the slightest, most tepid condemnation for the crimes that these governments impose on their own people and others, because they are “fighting” or “resisting” western influence, and by virtue of that, they can do no wrong in the context of this great power struggle. 

I have yet to see any evidence that they would be willing to forcefully condemn “non-west” dictators for anything they do, as long as the US/Europe oppose them, or any evidence that they would support a democratic cause if it would somehow benefit the west at the expense of great power rivals, but I'm open to hearing opposing views.",BrokkenArrow,234,0.6399999856948853,469,1695059287,2023-09-18

1i6qxi9,CMV: stop debating with conservatives. It is a waste of time. Work around them or against them. You will never change them.,"The last straw for me was the persistent blaming of immigrants for all of Britain’s woes when the real problem is the far right and the very rich.

To quote Sartre:

Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, or it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.
Jean-Paul Sartre

1bissk6,"CMV: most people who dislike centrists/moderates don’t want them to pick A side, they want them to pick THEIR side.","I want to start this off by saying that I would not call myself a moderate, I probably fall more in the classical liberalism camp. I believe that a lot of times whenever people criticize centrists/moderates they don’t even know what they are talking about, thinking that centrists want a compromise on every issue ever. This is not what a centrist is. 

While a centrist may indeed be more likely to admit that they don’t have enough information on a topic to form an opinion (that’s an incredibly wise thing to do, by the way, much better than just picking a side and not knowing what you’re talking about), that’s not what centrism is.

Centrism is having political positions on different topics which could be either considered liberal or conservative, putting their median position in the middle. For example, if you ask a centrist about abortion, gun control, higher taxes, and about universal healthcare, they might be pro-life, anti-gun control, pro-universal healthcare, and think we ought to raise taxes, that would make them, on average, in the middle. Centrists aren’t centrist on issues, they’re centrists on average.

I think most people understand this but pretend not to. It is perfectly fine to dislike centrism on that merit, but it seems that most people tend to distort what centrism is, turning it into a strawman. As seen in a popular comic which I am sure you have seen, a centrist is inbetween the KKK and members of the civil rights movement holding a sign that says “compromise?”

People on the left have used this comic to say “the kkk is the right wing and the civil rights movement is the left wing, and so they’re letting it happen!” Which is multiple straw men in one argument. The fact that this is such a repeated argument shows that they don’t hate moderates because they are moderates, they hate them because they’re not leftists. Same thing goes for the right wing.

There could be two people who have opposite viewpoints on everything, and still both be moderate.

1dckxpx,"CMV: In the context of American politics, the term “assault weapon” is poorly defined and the proposed “assault weapon bans” will have little to no effect on crime.","The term “assault weapon” does not have a generally agreed upon definition but in practice it seems to refer to anything that looks roughly like an AR-15 or Kalashnikov pattern rifle. It is an occasionally popular position in the Democratic Party to advocate for a ban on these rifles.

There are two problems with this. 1: The term “assault weapon” is so poorly defined it doesn’t ban weapons with virtually identical capabilities to AR-15s and Kalashnikovs, so it’s trivially easy to circumvent. 2: It is a proven fact that rifles are used in only a tiny portion of violent crime, as a matter of fact bare hands are a more common murder weapon than rifles, as are clubs or knives.

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls

So this proposal does not make logical sense. So-called “assault weapons” are not uniquely dangerous, they are not used in a large amount of crime, and the entire category is cosmetically defined.

I anticipate the primary argument in favor of an “assault weapons ban” to be to prevent mass shooting. This is a foolish strategy for preventing mass shootings as a person who is deranged can use almost any modern firearm to similarly deadly effect in the context of a mass shooting. Any typical handgun like a Glock for example would produce essentially the same deadly results.",Grandemestizo,359,0.7599999904632568,922,1718024461,2024-06-10 08:01:01,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dckxpx/cmv_in_the_context_of_american_politics_the_term/,6,2024,0.01958210261459359,0.22102231821454282,0.1203022104145682,cmv in the context of american politics the term assault weapon is poorly defined and the proposed assault weapon bans will have little to no effect on crime,the term assault weapon does not have a generally agreed upon definition but in practice it seems to refer to anything that looks roughly like an ar 15 or kalashnikov pattern rifle it is an occasionally popular position in the democratic party to advocate for a ban on these rifles there are two problems with this 1 the term assault weapon is so poorly defined it doesn t ban weapons with virtually identical capabilities to ar 15s and kalashnikovs so it s trivially easy to circumvent 2 it is a proven fact that rifles are used in only a tiny portion of violent crime as a matter of fact bare hands are a more common murder weapon than rifles as are clubs or knives so this proposal does not make logical sense so called assault weapons are not uniquely dangerous they are not used in a large amount of crime and the entire category is cosmetically defined i anticipate the primary argument in favor of an assault weapons ban to be to prevent mass shooting this is a foolish strategy for preventing mass shootings as a person who is deranged can use almost any modern firearm to similarly deadly effect in the context of a mass shooting any typical handgun like a glock for example would produce essentially the same deadly results,0,cmv in the context of american politics the term assault weapon is poorly defined and the proposed assault weapon bans will have little to no effect on crime the term assault weapon does not have a generally agreed upon definition but in practice it seems to refer to anything that looks roughly like an ar 15 or kalashnikov pattern rifle it is an occasionally popular position in the democratic party to advocate for a ban on these rifles there are two problems with this 1 the term assault weapon is so poorly defined it doesn t ban weapons with virtually identical capabilities to ar 15s and kalashnikovs so it s trivially easy to circumvent 2 it is a proven fact that rifles are used in only a tiny portion of violent crime as a matter of fact bare hands are a more common murder weapon than rifles as are clubs or knives so this proposal does not make logical sense so called assault weapons are not uniquely dangerous they are not used in a large amount of crime and the entire category is cosmetically defined i anticipate the primary argument in favor of an assault weapons ban to be to prevent mass shooting this is a foolish strategy for preventing mass shootings as a person who is deranged can use almost any modern firearm to similarly deadly effect in the context of a mass shooting any typical handgun like a glock for example would produce essentially the same deadly results

1cyfuom,CMV: Requiring landlords to prove tenant damage is more fair than requiring tenants to prove their innocence,"At every apartment I've rented, the landlord can charge the tenant for any damage or uncleanliness that they find. They don't need to provide any evidence or proof that the tenant was responsible for the damage. In order for the tenant to *not* owe the landlord money for this, the tenant needs to have noticed the damage/uncleanliness within the first few days of moving in and reported it to the landlord.

I think this is unfair, because it is unrealistic for a tenant to notice every minuscule damage or uncleanliness within the first few days. For example, most people probably wouldn't immediately notice dust on top of the fridge, but a landlord could charge a tenant for leaving dust on top of the fridge. Many people wouldn't immediately notice a broken blind, but a landlord can charge for this. Most people wouldn't immediately notice a small dent or scratch on the side of an appliance, but a landlord can charge for this.

I think what's more fair is requiring the landlord to prove the previous condition of anything they want to charge for. If they want to charge for dust on top of the fridge, they need a picture showing there was no dust when the tenant moved in. If they want to charge for a broken blind, they need a picture showing that all the blinds are not broken, et cetera. 

This would not only protect tenants from shitty landlords, it would protect landlords from shitty tenants. For example, a tenant could report ""damaged blinds"" seeing that two of them were broken, and they could break 10 more and pretend the original report of ""damaged blinds"" was referring to 12 broken blinds rather than 2.

1apr98a,"CMV: ""not all men"" is the socially righteous position to take","Statistics help show many facts as best as census data provides.

Some of these statistics show that in some places Islamic people are more likely to advocate Sharia. However, if you use these statistics to make generalisations about Islamic people that would be racist and inappropriate, because even a statistical majority does not mean that all Islamic people are that way. This kind of bigotry should be called out.

The same is true when people use statistics to say that black people are more likely to be criminals, or in gangs, and so on.

However ""men"" as a subgroup seems to be an exception. I think it's common to see people argue that it's obvious they aren't talking about all men, or that they are talking about all men because the good ones don't do enough. This is in discourse around gender based violence, where the statistics show that men are responsible for the majority of rapes, sexual assaults etc.

However, basing your view on men as a group on statistics is as flawed as basing your opinion of Muslims, blacks, and anyone else on statistics. It's by definition prejudice, and shoobe called out.

When you highlight that not all black people are criminals and that you shouldn't assume that from their race it is  socially just. The same goes for calling out prejudice against men based on statistics.

18p9saa,"CMV: If you are an ugly woman (like myself), you will not have it easy in society, and will have to make up for it in different ways","It is often said that men have lower standards than women, and that women don't have as much to worry about when dating. Growing up I've always heard that men have it harder because nobody will take of them, whereas men will almost always take care of woman (regardless of traits, employment, income).

Which I do mostly agree with, until looks are mentioned. Most men will not date, love, or take care of a woman they consider to be ugly. Being traditionally feminine, showing vulnerability, anxiousness, or being shy is are traits that are not afforded to me or other women who are considered 'ugly'.

In my personal experience, men have always treated me as if I were invisible or nothing. I have been called ugly, made fun of, and many guys have played me.

Furthermore, I've found that I've had to make up for where I lack in looks with bettering myself as a person. Raising my self esteem, not being sensitive/developing a thick skin, being more blunt, and being aloof.

The state expects (requires) that I have an ID card by the age of 12-13. The ID card is issued by the police and contains basic information (name, address, DoB, citizenship) and a photo.

I need to present my ID when:

* I visit my doctor
* I pick up a prescription from the pharmacy
* I open a bank account
* I start at a new workplace
* I vote
* I am asked by the police to present it
* I visit any ""state-owned service provider"" (tax authority, DMV, etc.)
* I sign any kind of contract

Now, I understand that the US is HUGE, and maybe having a federal-issued ID is unfeasible. However, what would be the issue with each state issuing their own IDs which are recognized by the other states? This is what we do today in Europe, where I can present my country's ID to another country (when I need to prove my identity).

169vziy,"CMV: If you wear MAGA swag, chances are you’re an asshole.","Not saying all Trump voters are assholes (I know many, including in my family, who are great people.) 

But if you believe in Trump’s message so fervently that you’d deck yourself out in Trump/MAGA iconography, it’s more likely than not that you’re probably a dickhead who believes in the worst, most emotive parts of his message. 

Many republicans/independents voted for him the past two elections either because he was the closest one to their position, not necessarily because they liked him. More of an anti-Democrat, pro-Republican vote than a pro-Trump vote.  If you’re sporting the red hat, or the bumper sticker, or have the flag pinned up somewhere though, it likely indicates that you’re a fan of the man himself, and by extension the more venomous elements of his platform (rabid anti-immigration in particular), rather than just lowering taxes. 

Totally open to changing my mind on this - I know that probably the counter-evidence would be anecdotal in nature and that’s fine (seeing as how my argument is based on anecdotal evidence as well - ive yet to come across a MAGA-branded person who, accounting for my own bias, wasnt a prickly cunt).

It’s not good enough, though, to just say “My dad is a good man and he loves Trump and wears the hat” - many racists/assholes/fuckheads are great with their family and neighbours. You’d have to show that they wear that shit *and* don’t subscribe to the shittiest parts of Trumpworld (I suppose you can try to argue that supporting something like family separations doesn’t make you an asshole, but I would disagree).

190573g,"CMV: As an Asian American, voting for the Democratic Party is the only viable option for me, as they are the lesser of two evils","As someone deeply engaged in the upcoming election, I remain aligned with the Democratic Party as an Asian American, especially considering I reside in California. This state is the wealthiest in the nation and holds a remarkable economic standing, with a GDP that, if considered independently, would rank among the top 10 globally.

On top of that, the GOP has this habit of throwing around racist remarks, which just doesn't sit right with Asians. It's the kind of stuff that could be used against them, especially when we're talking about the surge in hate crimes against Asians.

While Asians encompass a rich tapestry of ethnic diversity, I want zero in on the ""holy Asian trinity"" (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) due to their numerous and influential representation among the Asian community. Democrats tend to lean towards supporting social safety nets and regulations, and this tends to resonate more with educated minorities.

Education holds immense significance in Asian culture, exemplified by phenomena like cram schools in East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan, where students attend supplementary classes to gain a competitive edge in entrance exams to some of the most competitive colleges in their respective country.

Drawing a comparison within the U.S., states under Republican governance tend to exhibit lower academic achievements than their Democratic counterparts. This discrepancy is often attributed to the Republican Party's inclination to reduce funding for education, resulting in lower academic outcomes.

While there is a consensus that schools could benefit from increased cost efficiency, the solution does not lie in defunding education.

1c7ibn3,CMV: Housing should not be an investment ,"I don’t believe that it’s good that housing is viewed as an investment. The problems I see from this are that: 

1 - this makes housing artificially more expensive than it should be and leads to homelessness and people spending too much money on rent/mortgage.

2 - housing as investment provides an incentive for home owners to be nimby’s. A class of people is created that now oppose the construction of new housing because this makes their homes less valuable.

3 - it’s a poor place to store wealth. Having wealth tied up in housing isn’t economically productive. Would it be better for the economy if your house cost $50k or 500k? If it was only 50k, you could diversify your wealth. You could buy bonds to help fund companies or the government. You could buy stocks. You could just spend it and put it right into the economy. 

I’m not saying that all housing should cost the same. A 4,000 sq foot apartment in NYC is always going to cost way more than a 700 sq foot apartment in Oklahoma City. But I don’t believe the price of housing (rents or home prices) should be expected to rise faster than inflation. 

How would it be achievable? Simple - build more housing. Tons of it. And most of it should be non-profit housing. This is housing - ideally apartment buildings - that is deed restricted to not increase rent above costs of the building. 

This would be a huge net benefit for society.

180kyd2,CMV: I don't think the Marvels failed because moviegoers are sexist and racist,"As somebody who enjoys writing, I can empathize with the director Nia DaCosta. I would be heartbroken if a story I'd poured blood, sweat, and tears into was shunned by so many people and, going by any metric, the Marvels has failed to attract audiences. 

Nia DaCosta herself did an interview in which she said ""There are pockets that are really virulent and violent and racist — and sexist and homophobic and all those awful things. And I choose the side of the light. That’s the part of fandom I’m most attracted to."" I don't think it's fair to interpret that as her saying superhero fans in general are these things or the movie failed because of these things as some people are. 

But there are others who are convinced bigotry is responsible for the failure of ""The Marvels"" or at least primarily responsible. Based on the data I've seen, I don't think this is the case. It's true that white people and men didn't turn out in large numbers which could suggest bigotry was a major factor. But nobody else did either. 

So why did the Marvels perform poorly? In my view...

The Marvels itself does not score particularly well with critics. This is probably the biggest factor. A movie can have legs if it gets good word of mouth from viewers and critics. Elemental is a great example. Bombed initially, but came roaring back. The A cinema score no doubt helped it. And elemental touched on racism and discrimination too. 

Due to the strikes there was limited press

There's a lot of superhero fatigue. I personally couldn't make it through more than 15 minutes of part 1 of avengers endgame. 

These all seem like more logical explanations than rampant racism and sexism.

1edo50c,CMV: stigma against the childless needs to end,"As a man in my early 20s, my friends and I are regularly bombarded by comments from family like “you need to find someone to have kids with soon”; “you need to have kids when you’re young”; “you will regret not having kids”; “only losers don’t have kids” and so on.

That’s just family right? We learn to live with it. But when Trump’s permanently-grumpy running mate called childless women “cat ladies” , I thought: this type of behaviour needs to stop.

I don’t have anything against having children. If that’s part of your journey in life, then I wish you well. Maybe it brings you immense fulfillment in life, and if so, I’m happy for you.

However, in my personal observation, many more people are less happy than when they were childless. And many more people regret having children than not having children.

So a lot of people, especially my age, are realizing that beyond economic limitations, we just aren’t interested in having children because we’d be less happy if we did. I, for one, would much rather be hiking or biking on my own than changing diapers or watching little league games.

And I don’t see anything wrong with doing what maximizes my happiness if it doesn’t harm anyone else.

So if you’re someone who thinks there’s something so unethical or immoral about this opinion or lifestyle that people should be called “cat ladies” for having them, I’m happy to discuss.",honeyetsweet,543,0.6299999952316284,1043,1722107740,2024-07-27 14:15:40,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1edo50c/cmv_stigma_against_the_childless_needs_to_end/,7,2024,0.039711191335740074,0.25005999520038397,0.14488559326806202,cmv stigma against the childless needs to end,as a man in my early 20s my friends and i are regularly bombarded by comments from family like you need to find someone to have kids with soon you need to have kids when you re young you will regret not having kids only losers don t have kids and so on that s just family right we learn to live with it but when trump s permanently grumpy running mate called childless women cat ladies i thought this type of behaviour needs to stop i don t have anything against having children if that s part of your journey in life then i wish you well maybe it brings you immense fulfillment in life and if so i m happy for you however in my personal observation many more people are less happy than when they were childless and many more people regret having children than not having children so a lot of people especially my age are realizing that beyond economic limitations we just aren t interested in having children because we d be less happy if we did i for one would much rather be hiking or biking on my own than changing diapers or watching little league games and i don t see anything wrong with doing what maximizes my happiness if it doesn t harm anyone else so if you re someone who thinks there s something so unethical or immoral about this opinion or lifestyle that people should be called cat ladies for having them i m happy to discuss,0,cmv stigma against the childless needs to end as a man in my early 20s my friends and i are regularly bombarded by comments from family like you need to find someone to have kids with soon you need to have kids when you re young you will regret not having kids only losers don t have kids and so on that s just family right we learn to live with it but when trump s permanently grumpy running mate called childless women cat ladies i thought this type of behaviour needs to stop i don t have anything against having children if that s part of your journey in life then i wish you well maybe it brings you immense fulfillment in life and if so i m happy for you however in my personal observation many more people are less happy than when they were childless and many more people regret having children than not having children so a lot of people especially my age are realizing that beyond economic limitations we just aren t interested in having children because we d be less happy if we did i for one would much rather be hiking or biking on my own than changing diapers or watching little league games and i don t see anything wrong with doing what maximizes my happiness if it doesn t harm anyone else so if you re someone who thinks there s something so unethical or immoral about this opinion or lifestyle that people should be called cat ladies for having them i m happy to discuss
1fi41o4,CMV: Voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election means you're either ill informed or actively opposed to democracy.,"If you're voting for Trump in the 2024 election, it suggests that you either have a lack of understanding about what has happened over the last decade and have been subject to misinformation, or are actively against democracy. 

There is a minority of Trump-voters who would like to see another system in place than the current system of democratic values, because they think their values and ideals are more important than democracy. Those who would rather live in a tyranny or other aristocratic system, as long as their needs and values are met. 

The vast part of the republican voters does not want to get rid of democracy - nor is it in their best interest - and are just un- or misinformed about current events. Even if your opinions are generally in line with most of the things Trump stands for, and you're actively opposed to everything Harris stands for, it should not matter since one side does not adhere to democratic values and the other does. I understand that a lot of information that people in the US get is heavily colored in favour of one candidate or the other

All of this has been made especially clear since January 6th; if you support a candidate that attempted to commit a coup d'était, you want to subvert democracy, or you don't have the correct information to make an informed choice.

I'm open to discussion and reconsidering my views if presented with new insights, as ""they're all misinformed or authoritarian"" feels overly simplistic. My perspective comes from observing recent events, but I'm curious to see whether my view is shaped by the news I receive or if there’s a more nuanced explanation.

1kzv1tu,"CMV: Out of all the groups that immigrate to western countries, Muslim Arabs are hands down the worst at assimilating to western standards","I am saying this as an Exmuslim Arab myself and yes, I know there’s exceptions. I know they’re not all that way. But the painting is on the wall. I’m not saying anyone should abandon their religion, but integration is very important when you are moving to a new country. 

The reason why immigrants coming from let’s say Mexico or Latin America integrate so well is because western cultures aren’t that different and share similar values. The differences between traditional Islamic Arab culture and western culture are so astronomically different that conflict usually arises. Europe's weak stance on who they let in from the Middle East proves this, just look at Birmingham or at Malmo. 

People say ""racism"" and “Islamophobia” very loosely. If people are coming to your home country(pick many of the EU), causing chaos, pushing their own beliefs, killings, getting benefits from a western nation, etc. of course people are going to start getting pissed off. 

Muslim Arabs originally born in the Middle East are used to their thoughts and values being the majority. They get a little confused in melting pot western cultures where they encounter a lot of people with different views. They’re so indoctrinated to think one way that assimilation is nearly impossible. Try going and be a raging Christian in Saudi Arabia, wouldn’t work. You would have to assimilate. 

What you worship or your religion is your business, but to move to a new western nation and expect to force the laws and beliefs of your former nation is just peak disrespect. European countries shouldn’t have ‘no go zones’ because some immigrants refuse to adopt the host country's culture and values.

1exwwiv,CMV: gifted programs should not be removed from any STATE. ,"The Seattle school district and many other left-leaning states are planning to remove gifted programs for children due to a lack of racial representation in these programs. I believe this is unjustified and doesn’t make sense. It would be like making professional athletes go back to playing in an academy.

As someone who was part of a gifted program in high school, I found that regular schoolwork wasn’t challenging or engaging. It made me dread going to school, as it felt like placing an adult in a kindergarten class to learn 1+1 and expecting them to be excited about it for the next three years.

It’s also unfair to teachers and administrators, who are expected to adapt and create convoluted curricula for each individual when students are not separated by performance. They’re already underpaid and are being further burdened by the government to do extra work.

What happened to academic meritocracy? Why are we equating racial segregation with intellectual segregation?

Imagine if sports teams had similar policies, where instead of always picking the best players, they had to meet a racial quota.

Some might argue that gifted students have greater access to resources, which allows them to perform better in school, making it unfair for them to access better education and opportunities. But that same logic could be applied in reverse to any aspiring athlete: If someone had better access to equipment, nutrition, and trainers, should they also be excluded from gifted athlete programs?

1fboo3p,CMV: Hijabs are sexist,"I've seen people (especially progressive people/Muslim women themselves) try to defend hijabs and make excuses for why they aren't sexist.

But I think hijabs are inherently sexist/not feminist, especially the expectation in Islam that women have to wear one. The basic idea behind wearing a hijab (why it's a thing in the first place) is to cover your hair to prevent men from not being able to control themselves, which is problematic. It seems almost like victim-blaming, like women are responsible for men's impulses/temptations. Why don't Muslim men have to cover their hair?

I've heard feminist Muslim women try to make defenses for it. (Like, ""It brings you closer to God,"" etc.) But they all sound like excuses, honestly. This is basically proven by the simple fact that women don't have to wear one around other women or their male family members, but they have to wear it around other men that aren't their husbands. There is no other reason for that, besides sexism/heteronormativity, that actually makes sense. Not to mention, what if the woman is lesbian, or the man is gay?

1lkwnvc,CMV: anti-natalism achieves nothing besides ensuring that progressivism will die out in the west.,"Fairly simple premise, all data indicates that over the last 30 years increasingly the biggest predictor of a groups fertility rate in the west has been: religiousness, and conservativeness.

We know that temperament and ideology are heritable both in the form of social indoctrination, but also that literally someone's disposition and biology can lend itself to how religious or conservative they are. People rebel, but not as often as they don't.

All the doom cult of anti-natalism achieves is ensuring that over the next 100 years the majority in the west will have been raised in religious and conservative households and liberally temperamental people will have become a minority.

I genuinely think the rise of MAGA etc in young men and the recent reversal in the trend of the youth vote getting more and more liberal is in part due to this fact that has been bearing out for long enough now to procure the first generation where there was a measurable difference in fertility rates between democrats and republicans.",RatioFinal4287,1021,0.699999988079071,826,1750933661,2025-06-26 05:27:41,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1lkwnvc/cmv_antinatalism_achieves_nothing_besides/,6,2025,0.0920030631221967,0.19798416126709864,0.14499361219464768,cmv anti natalism achieves nothing besides ensuring that progressivism will die out in the west,fairly simple premise all data indicates that over the last 30 years increasingly the biggest predictor of a groups fertility rate in the west has been religiousness and conservativeness we know that temperament and ideology are heritable both in the form of social indoctrination but also that literally someone s disposition and biology can lend itself to how religious or conservative they are people rebel but not as often as they don t all the doom cult of anti natalism achieves is ensuring that over the next 100 years the majority in the west will have been raised in religious and conservative households and liberally temperamental people will have become a minority i genuinely think the rise of maga etc in young men and the recent reversal in the trend of the youth vote getting more and more liberal is in part due to this fact that has been bearing out for long enough now to procure the first generation where there was a measurable difference in fertility rates between democrats and republicans,0,cmv anti natalism achieves nothing besides ensuring that progressivism will die out in the west fairly simple premise all data indicates that over the last 30 years increasingly the biggest predictor of a groups fertility rate in the west has been religiousness and conservativeness we know that temperament and ideology are heritable both in the form of social indoctrination but also that literally someone s disposition and biology can lend itself to how religious or conservative they are people rebel but not as often as they don t all the doom cult of anti natalism achieves is ensuring that over the next 100 years the majority in the west will have been raised in religious and conservative households and liberally temperamental people will have become a minority i genuinely think the rise of maga etc in young men and the recent reversal in the trend of the youth vote getting more and more liberal is in part due to this fact that has been bearing out for long enough now to procure the first generation where there was a measurable difference in fertility rates between democrats and republicans
1jmvjws,CMV: Republicans are the very thing they despise,"Republican voters and conservatives are anything but. They elected a fascist authoritarian, a man who is, by his own admission, a dictator. They want a dismantling of our republic and democracy in favor of anti-American strong man authoritarianism. They voted for the most anti-establishment candidate that I know of, revoking the conservative dogma of actually conserving the status quo in favor of breaking it. They claim the libs are snowflakes when they are the ones that cannot handle facts and debates, as we can see in r/Conservative. They claim that republicans are better at governing, when that is demonstrably false at the federal, state, and local level. They claim to hate welfare, but they are some of the biggest recipients of government aid, at the federal, state, and local level. They claim to be followers of Jesus Christ, but they act in a way that directly contradicts his teachings, such as love thy neighbor.

183xayy,"cmv: When people say 'white', they mean 'white North American'.","Disclaimer: This doesn't really affect North American people. This post is centered around a Eurpean perspective, and so it might be confusing to some of you. 


I live in Germany as an immigrant, and I have friends from all across the world. I am European. 

Across the bank, the majority of friends I have met that were from outside of Europe had a very specific set of prejudices against me, that never really bothered me too much and just calmly explained this was not a thing in my country. 

I have noticed, however, that some things always repeated although being absolutely absurd. Here are some examples of the things I have been told/ were expected of me. 

1) Not seasoning food

- I am Italian. We have very simple cuisine but it's good. The same friends who tell me this about ""white people"" love my cooking and ask for my recipes/ to make their favourite dish again. 

2) Not having an own culture

- A friend of mine said something along the lines of ""White people appropriate other cultures and festivities because they don't really have their own"". I believe we were talking about Dia de los Muertos in that regard. But all European countries have their own very different cultures. 

In general, I don't think ""black culture"" and ""white culture"" apply to Europe the same way they do to the US. While there may be an african american culture across the U.S., my Ethiopian friend and my Tanzanian friend have just as little in common as a Russian and a Spanish person. They don't share one culture, they each have their own, which may overlap in some parts of life. 

3) My culture was never oppressed

I come from a part of Italy that used to have it's own language and traditions. When Italy was formed in the 19th century, people were forced to stop having their own customs and speaking their own language, or call themselves anything other than Italians. 

My grandparents still spoke the language, but I was never allowed to. I was expected to behave like an Italian so that I would have better chances in life and people would not know my background, which was considered lesser. 

I am not an exception. There are many ethnic groups in Europe that are considered white and still suffered oppression and sometimes persecution. I hate to see these stories devalued by someone saying a blanket statement.

4) This is silly, but the sandal

""White people will never understand how scary it is when your mother picks up the sandal"". But we do have the sandal in Italy. And when I pointed this out, I was told that that was cultural appropriation. 

5) Beige

""White people love to have their walls painted beige and all interior decor has to be beige.""

This was just yesterday. I talked about how houses in my region are not like that at all. And then I thought about it and described how Swedish houses are not like that. Nor are russian houses. Or French ones. Or Spanish ones. Or German ones, at that. Even my German friend, who initially agreed (in shame) that all white houses were just beige, did so while sitting in her perfectly colourful apartment with no beige in sight. I asked her if she had ever seen such a beige home in real life. She has not. Neither had anyone else, when we thought about it. 

To be honest, I don't even think most American white people live like that. I think it's just a social media fad. 



And that brings me to the reason why I am here:

As much as I am not upset at people when they make assumptions, it can be tiring when you hear the same things over and over again. I am upset that European people have to be culturally associated with North America just because we look similar, even though culturally we are so far apart. Social media paints a picture where every white person is from a Florida suburb, and people choose to believe it.

1fpssmp,Cmv: You can absolutely be racist to white people,"I hate when people say that you can't be racist to white people. As far as i'm concerned it means ""i'm racist but i don't wanna take accountability for it so i'm gonna water it down to prejudice and use my marganalization as an excuse"" 

Let's take a look at some definitions of racism and go over them. This is the one you get by google. It comes from oxford languages.


""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.""

First of all. The definition clearly states that racism is typically experienced by minorities/marganalized people but not exclusively. If this was the case then the definition wouldn't have the word ""typically"" in it.

This definition also describes the fact that there are different types of racism (such as interpersonal racism and institutional racism) and white people can absolutely experience racism on an interpersonal level

I'll also go over a second definition by merriam webster

1
: a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race

also : behavior or attitudes that reflect and foster this belief : racial discrimination or prejudice

2
a
: the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another

b
: a political or social system founded on racism and designed to execute its principles

This clearly also describes that racism can manifest in different ways. With what was being described under section 1 would be called interpersonal racism and what would be described under section 2 would  be described as systemic/institutional racism.

People say stuff like ""you can't be racist to white people"" and ""black people can't be racist"" to justify/downplay hatred towards white people. I have even heard that ""hate crime against white people is not a thing"" BUT IT IS A THING. if you committ a crime against someone because of their race it is a hate crime and being marganalized and opressed is not an excuse for that

We need to stop giving BIPOC passes when they say something racist about white people. I see it on tiktok all of the time. I hate it when they call me ""palm colored"" just call me ""white"" or caucasian. I am not going to be anyone's punching bag. You need to realize that the mindset that one race is ""less than"" is exactly what created the system of opression in the first place and if you are truly serious about equality, BIPOC should be held to the same standards as white people. Not to a lesser standard. I honestly think saying that shouldn't even be controversial but here we are.

1858lk8,CMV: Not voting for Biden in 2024 as a left leaning person is bad political calculus,"Biden's handling of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts has encouraged many left-leaning people to affirm that they won't be voting for him in the general election in 2024. Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively.

Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest.

To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.

To assist, while I wouldn't dismiss anything outright, the following points are ones I would have a really hard time buying into:

- Accelerationism

In these cases, my offers have been solid.  I've offered 20% down, have good credit, and in some cases have gone over asking with my offer. It doesn't matter.  The offer with waived home inspection always wins, and I'm not willing to give this up.

But this got me thinking... It seems like, if a buyer can waive a home inspection and people are willing to do that as a concession, then nobody gets to have a home inspection. All buyers are eventually going to be forced to waive it to compete if they want any home at all.  

This opens all buyers up to the risks of buying a house without an inspection: potential structural issues, electrical issues, water intrusion issues, etc, that will be so expensive to fix that they may result in bankruptcy, with no way of knowing ahead of time what you're walking into.  That's an insane way to live.

Any current owner/seller, even the ones who don't think there's any major issue with the house they're selling, would be morons to not push that risk onto the buyer if they can get away with it.  It basically absolves them of their duty as homeowners to maintain their own property and makes it somebody else's problem.  In fact, if they know they're going to get an offer from somebody who waives inspection, it practically invites them to defer maintenance!  Why fix it right if you can sell the house and make it somebody else's problem?

Legality aside, I'm honestly not sure why mortgage companies allow it in their terms, since it puts the loan at risk if the buyer immediately becomes upside down and declares bankruptcy due to the need for major remediation.

And none of this is a case of ""if somebody's stupid enough to do that it's on them"" because it's such a juicy plum for the seller that it forces the whole market down into the mud to compete. Once we're there, there may as well not be any home inspections at all.  

If you want any buyers to be able to do preliminary home inspections, they needs to be a legal requirement.

1lb86kj,CMV: Israel attacking Iran makes perfect sense.,"Iran built its entire Israel strategy around a network of proxy states and paramilitary groups. They spent tens of billions of dollars arming Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis and supporting Bashar Al Asads regime in Syria. 

The goal of this investment was to encircle Israel and grant Iran the ability to threaten Israel on multiple fronts while protecting Iranian territory. 

This strategy failed big time and faster than anyone could imagine. 

In less than two years, Israel has nearly annihilated Hamas, decapitated Hezbollah, precipitated the fall of Asad’s Syria, and is perfectly capable of handling the Houthis who turned to be more of a nuisance than a threat. 

Iran is now alone, reasonably broke, and at its weakest. 

Israel is winning on all fronts and has retained the military support of all its allies. Add to this the potential alignment of the entire Levantine region with Saudi Arabia. 

It makes absolute sense to strongly and aggressively attack Iran right now. This is the closest to the regime falling Iran has probably ever been, and the weakest militarily.

18qcgj9,CMV: People who perceive intellectual conversations as douchey and pretentious are idiots who are just insecure and feel the need to prove their superiority,"I cannot even count how many times I have tried bringing up intellectual topics, or even simple things like analysis of a painting, a movie or any other kind of art form, and whenever I use any word that is a bit uncommon or try to bring some nuanced perspective in the conversation, people either feel the need to one up me by disagreeing with some irrelevant argument, or just clock out of the conversation and call me a douche behind my back. I have also tried doing these things without making other people feel excluded and explaining ideas in a simple manner, but seems like most people just care about surface level discussions and somehow think discussing anything in depth makes you a pretentious narcissist.  
And this is not just limited to personal experience. In most scenarios, people club anyone bringing up anything remotely intelligent as pretentious and feel the need to one up the person by clubbing him/her into categories like r/iamverysmart or something similar. Its such a disgrace. I also feel like this stems from an anti-elitist mentality but even that is harmful for us as it hinders innovation and lateral thinking.  


However I agree that I may be wrong, so please feel free to give reasons as to why this kind of behavior is justified. And like I said, this is not just from personal experience even though that plays its own part, but this is a sentiment I have seen being echoed very frequently no matter which kind of circle you are in, so please keep that in mind as well before criticizing me or assuming that somehow I am a douche who is trying to justify his actions by calling other people out.

1fmoifs,"CMV: Joining the military is not inherently noble, and treating military servicepeople as more noble than civilians is misguided","Search the web and you’ll quickly discover that the reasons most men and women join the military are related to personal gain. Reasons listed usually include things like:

- “It pays well”.
- “I wanted to travel the world.”
- “I needed to get through college.”
- “I wanted to fly a helicopter.”
- “I wanted to make Papa proud.”
- “My buddy joined.”

Such reasons are not noble. The following is an example of a noble reason:

- “I have throughly thought through the implications of how my country is positioned geopolitically, I understand how our national military budget is spent, and I have fully examined the ethics of offensive military programs. I am fully convinced that our military operations are ethically sound. I thus firmly believe that by serving I would be doing the Right Thing.”

It’s incredibly rare to hear anyone giving such a thoroughly nuanced reason for enlisting which includes a justification for any particular “war”.

On the other hand, throughout history, the most noble of warriors emphatically DID NOT fight just to get through college or pay for their first house.

1lj4ihd,Cmv: Russia is a sh*thole and it’s partially because of their culture,"Sup everyone, Im from southern France and there is a huge Russian community there, people don’t talk a lot about them because people are too focused on Arabs to care and on top there is quite a large admiration about Russian culture here. And I agree I love Russian literature, animation history etc etc… but there is another aspect that I don’t think people talk about, they have a group snug and demeaning attitude (on average ofc everyone is different). There is a culture of silence in Russia, people don’t say how they feel and there is pressure to fold to conformity as “Russia is just better and everything from the outside sucks”.  A lot generally think Russia is just arbitrarily better then other countries and so ignore evidence and statistics with their own eyes in the name of the country or whatever and it causes them to use whataboutism and fall in dogmatism, and thats one of the reasons they let themselves get fucked over by putin and his friends and ignore that to focus on Ukrainian nazis or whatever in Ukraine. Hell all the Russians I know in France are almost all fiercely anti western and genuinely believe Ukraine is full of nazis while Russia has more neo nazi groups then Ukraine ( in Russia nazi means anti Russian tho but they say that while they have been anti Ukraine since forever) and thats despite the fact they live and benefit from the west. Russia is poor cuz they ignore corruption due to that culture of silence and instead of fighting back most delude themselves in Russia is just better mentality and ignore it. A lot of Russians have this idea that that Russia is better because of the community aspect despite the fact that u can find that communial and united aspect in other countries and cultures as well you just have to intergrate something which most don’t.

1d6iy5e,CMV: The only requirement to celebrating pride is being a proud LGBTQ+ person or a straight ally with no other political stances unrelated to lgbtq rights being necessary.,"It's pride month. I am a gay man. I'll see posts and such from friends along the lines of ""You can't celebrate pride if you're not against Israel in their conflict with Gaza. You can't celebrate pride if you don't believe in BLM.""

I personally believe both those things. But I think it's dumb to gatekeep pride with sentiments like that. That you're not allowed to celebrate pride if you're not in lockstep with other political causes. I think that logic is wrong. Here is my reasoning. 

1. You can say it's about ""gay people's protest against oppressor so that means you must be against other forms of people protesting against their oppressors"". But there's plenty of examples of people rising up against their ""oppressors"" that I'm sure most western progressive thinking people wouldn't agree with at all. It's not about standing up against oppressors in general. It's specifically and exclusively about LGBTQ+ people standing up to their oppressors, gaining rights, and creating better lives for themselves, and celebrating how far we've come.
2. I believe it holds up an oppressed minority group up to a higher standard. Simply because a person is gay that means inherently that have more of a responsibility to be support of all other causes of inequality? That's dumb. They should be against other forms of inequality because they're a human being, like anyone else should, that has nothing to do with their sexuality of gender identity. I get you can say it's hypocritical, but that's such a naive way of thinking of it. In a perfect world yes hypocrites wouldn't exist. But anyone of any demographic, oppressed or otherwise, has just as much likelihood to be a bigoted asshole. Telling an lgbtq person they're supposed to have some sort of inherently quality because they are lgbtq is exactly the type of stuff we're fighting against. 

I'm open to having my opinion changed, but frankly it's pretty inconsequential for me because I agree with most of the causes I've seen it being compared to and needing to support. The only one I saw that I was a little iffy on was being against fatphobia. I don't make fun of overweight people, in fact I'm attracted to bearish men, and I think it's great plus size people are getting more media exposure. But I see some probably rage baity things online about what fatphobia is that makes me roll my eyes so idk maybe I am fatphobic? Getting in the weeds there, but the point still stands, I don't think there should be this gatekeeping attitude with pride.

1jmt165,CMV: American soft power is being steadily wiped out,"As we all know, American soft power is currently in the dumps, with many people outside the country either viewing it as a laughingstock or trembling in fear of it. Few people seem to actually respect and want to cooperate with it anymore.

A big reason of course is Donald Trump. Not only has he alienated the rest of the democratic world by withdrawing support from Ukraine and cozying up with autocrats, but by threatening to conquer Canada and Greenland he has made the people of these countries see the US as an aggressive monster. And America’s international reputation won’t be repaired after he leaves, since everyone will know that every election the US has a 50% chance of electing a capricious Republican. Hell, America’s reputation is arguably still damaged from the Bush II administration.

But it goes beyond Donald Trump. Already the US is seen as a laughingstock due to our lack of universal healthcare, poor labor and food safety standards, lack of walkability, and now our regression on social issues. It has gone as far as when people consider immigrating to the US (eg in r/IWantOut) the default response is “no don’t come here it’s too dangerous and it sucks compared to other developed nations.”

And American companies are losing influence too. Most prominently, the US auto industry is fated to become like the East German auto industry. Coddled by tariffs, they are being bodied by the Chinese auto industry on the world stage. Chinese electrical vehicle brands like BYD are dominating in places as diverse as Southeast Asia and Australia and are making massive inroads into Europe. Soon, American cars will only be viable in the American domestic market. Just look at the number of posts lamenting the lack of affordable Chinese cars in r/electricvehicles in the US. Similar things can be said about the American drones (nonexistent), renewables (threatened by Trump and was behind China beforehand), or AI (which seemed like a bright spot until Deepseek showed up).

And soon, even the most prominent manifestation of American soft power - Hollywood and the arts - will be on the decline. The reason I actually made this CMV is because there is currently massive drama surrounding the SAG-AFTRA voice actor guild. Originally American VAs have been striking for AI protections, leading to games like Genshin Impact to be unvoiced for months. However, people realized that it wasn’t just about AI protections; SAG-AFTRA also wanted to maintain a monopoly on VA work, where only union members can work on projects. This came to a head when Hoyoverse (the Chinese company behind Genshin) hired a Japan-based VA to replace a striking American VA, causing him to be denounced as a scab by SAG-AFTRA VAs and putting the Genshin community in turmoil (just search “SAG-AFTRA controversy” in r/Genshjn_Impact).

Now, people are predicting that Hoyoverse and other international companies will avoid hiring American VAs like the plague, in order to avoid SAG-AFTRA’s monopoly. Already, most new English voices in Genshin and Wuthering Waves (another Chinese video game) have been from the UK. Furthermore, people are using this opportunity to highlighting how backwards the US is in general, from the general nastiness of both US labor laws and labor unions, to China having stronger AI protections (despite Chinese people being more AI-friendly than Americans).

So the trend is unmistakable: the international community, in both the political and economic spheres, are increasingly shunning the US. By the end of Trump’s term, I predict the US will look like Russia: a hated, isolated country whose most prominent exports are agricultural and petrochemical products, which arms sales if we’re lucky. Meanwhile, China, buoyed by its national champions like BYD and Hoyoverse, is set to take its place as the world’s global superpower.",ice_cold_fahrenheit,910,0.8700000047683716,328,1743273511,2025-03-29

17wqbsc,CMV: an engagement ring should be given back if the engagement is called off.,"I was watching a Netflix show where a woman decides she’s no longer attracted to her fiancé so she breaks things off. When he asks for the ring back she refuses, he hesitates then agrees that she can keep it and angrily claims that every time she sees it she’ll think of their short lived relationship. 

This got me thinking of my ex fiancé, and how I broke things off, I did pretty much the same thing and she claimed it was so pretty so I gave in and let her keep it, eventually I got it back but there was no reason for her to keep it in the first place as an engagement ring represents a promise, it’s usually expensive, and it basically turns into a trophy celebrating how I got this person to propose to me, it seems almost greedy or narcissistic to keep.

1kfok4r,CMV: The US should not be supporting Israel.,"**I am going to make this case purely off of how Israel has acted towards the West, and NOT their war crimes in the Gaza strip or occupation zones or anything like that.**

This is for 2 reasons:

1. because many Western readers may not be as concerned with the Palestine issue (understandable, as it doesn't directly affect their daily lives as much as the climate crisis or social issues),
2. and because Israel often claims that the ICC and the rest of the world courts are biased against Israel, so we'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they're correct and aren't committing even a single crime against Palestinians.

so I will try to make the case that Israel's violations **towards Western powers alone** should be the reason we cut funding to that country.

* Israel [does not honor US sanctions on Russia](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/netanyahu-governments-approach-russia-and-ukraine) in response to the Ukraine invasion, making it the only US ally to do so. They continue full trade with them against the request of the US, as US-led NATO is actively trying to repel the Russian invasion in Ukraine and negotiate to end the war.
* Not only that, they go even further and demand the US allows [Russia to be able to keep their military bases in Syria](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-lobbies-us-keep-russian-bases-weak-syria-sources-say-2025-02-28/) following the deposition of Omar al-Bashir.
   * (Russia literally [funds Iran and Hamas](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/russias-relationship-hamas-and-putins-global-calculations) btw)
   * And they do it by lobbying US politicians so we have no choice but to comply with their demands.

After all the funding they’ve received from American taxpayers, they have used it to

* [steal nuclear ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_affair)materials and secrets from the US,
* possess nuclear weapons
   * but gets upset if[ other countries try to](https://x.com/AIPAC/status/1919467904359157963?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet).
* in 2002, [Israel advocated for invasion of Iraq using 300 thousand US soldiers](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/04/opinion/taking-apart-iraq-s-nuclear-threat.html) (US invaded Iraq in 2003)
   * also generally participated in the Saddam Hussein WMD misinformation campaign against US citizens
* and straight up [attacked the USS Liberty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident),
   * we invaded [Mexico because they accidentally arrested a group of US sailors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampico_Affair) and released them an hour later with an apology, then they refused to perform a 21-gun salute to the American flag at the request of a US admiral.
   * we invaded Grenada because they were [building an airport](https://www.projectcensored.org/12-the-grenada-invasion-a-classic-case-of-censorship/) that looked like it could be used to attack the US. Every other Caribbean country at this time already had an airport, as they rely heavily on their tourist industries.

Israel is the largest recipient of [US aid of any country (post WW2)](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-military-aid-does-the-us-give-to-israel/), even compared to Ukraine ([USD 180 billion](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)).

If someone comes to your door right now, and says: ""Hi, we would like you to sign our petition. Right now you can send USD 4 billion of aid to Israel, it'll just go on the deficit and US taxpayers will have their taxes increased to cover the cost.""

1d614o5,"CMV: People are treating mental disorders like they’re zodiac signs or personality tests. It’s dangerous and weird, but it’s the price we pay for lowering the stigma around mental illness.","I have ADD. I was diagnosed as a child and I’ve lived with it for most of my life. My mother has issues with anxiety, depression, and hoarding. My sisters struggle with the former two. None of us, however, *identify* with our illnesses to the extent that we turn it into a personality trait. We’re shaped by it but we are not *it*. This is where I think there’s a problem today. People are becoming tribal around the ideas of mental illness. Autism, ADHD, Bipolar, Anxiety, Tourettes, the more the concepts and language of academic psychology and psychiatry bleed into everyday life, the more people are going to construct their identities around it.

But I don’t think that’s healthy. I’m sure there will be plenty of people who respond to this who will say they’ve found community, connection and understanding through meeting/talking to others who share their illness. But when something as expansive yet also nebulous as mental illness is gets boiled down to 30 second tiktok video, we’re risking over expanding the definitions of illness so that they’re otherwise meaningless. Take a look at r/adhd for example. I’m a member of that group but I don’t frequent it often because the sheer amount of things people attribute to their ADD is ridiculous. People fail to understand the difference between correlation and causation and as a result we get posts like “I don’t like eating cake. DAE struggle with eating cake as an ADHDer??”

That’s a crude parody but it gets my point across. People are associating things to mental illness that are just normal human likes/dislikes. Yes, people don’t like doing laundry or brushing/flossing their teeth. Nobody, unless you love the sensation of floss on gum, enjoys doing chores. That’s why they’re called chores. If they were fun to do we’d call them “fun tasks”. But associating the dislike of chores as something inherent to ADHD is silly but when you take an idea like that, throw it into a lively internet community and combine it with the human desire to understand themselves or find a roadmap to building an identity you begin to the same “trait” adopted by others.

Most “neurodivergent” brains show no major differences from other humans brains. There are no “depression fingerprints” on the brain that allow people to identify a brain that has depression from a brain that doesn’t. The same principle applies to all other mental illnesses. It differs from person to person to person who are in turned shaped by their family, culture, and upbringing. But people want that roadmap so they’ll flatten that wide expanse into a flat binary of “ADHD” and “NON-ADHD”. Take the DSM for example, they tried to eliminate the diagnosis of aspergers and combine it with autism if I remember correctly but when people who’d identified as being “ASPIES” found out, they howled in protest at their erasure.

But, unfortunately, I don’t think there’s anyway to avoid this. The more we talk about something, the more we lower the barrier for entry. The more we lower the barrier, the more people can glom onto it for identity building. Kind of like the kids who, when I was a young, would fake cut marks on themselves to seem edgy and for personality fodder. But now we get it for every mental illness imaginable. To add a final point to this, I think the minute we start making other people’s symptoms iron laws for our own personalities is the minute we begin to limit and create reasons for why we “can’t” do something. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

We constantly talk about how much trauma there is in the world, how easy it is to be traumatized, how sensitive we have to be to other people’s trauma and how trauma trauma trauma can be and now we have high schoolers and middle schoolers claiming they have PTSD at rates combat veterans don’t have. Maybe some of them do, but I don’t think kids in the United States have it harder or that their classmates are any crueler then their grandparents generation before them. Or even my generation now. So either people have a bunch of repressed trauma a la’ the satanic panic of the 80’s that they’re discovering or people are using it as a clay to sculpt a personality

1hkwd3q,"CMV: The Democrats are not a ""right-wing"" party and are not out of step with center-left parties in other developed countries.","This is something you here all the time on Reddit, and from people on the left generally, that the Democrats are actually a ""right-wing"" party on the international level and somehow their policies would be center right in other post-industrial democracies. People can arguable about the specifics of ""right-wing"" and ""left-wing"" so the more precise case I'm making is that the policy goals of the Democratic party are not out of step or somehow way further to the right compared to other mainstream, center-left parties in Europe or other Western democracies. If the policies of the Democratic party were transported to the United Kingdom or Germany, they would be much closer to Labour or the SPD and aren't going to suddenly fit right in with the Tories or the CDU. 

I will change my view if someone can read the [2024 Democratic platform](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FINAL-MASTER-PLATFORM.pdf) and tell me what specific policy proposals in there would not be generally supported by center-left parties in Europe or other Western democracies. 

In 2020, Biden ran on a platform that included promises like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, providing universal pre-k, making community college and public four year universities free, creating a public option for health insurance, among other things. Biden's primary legislative accomplishments were passing massive fiscal stimulus through the American Rescue Plan and infrastructure law and a major subsidies for green energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. He also expended a bunch of political capital on a plan for widespread student loan forgiveness that even other Democratic politicians conceded went beyond the scope of the Executive Branch's powers. I don't see how any of these things can be considered remotely right-wing. Even left-wing commentators like Ezra Klein at the New York Times have said that the Biden administration has been the most progressive administration ever in American history.

I think the assertion that Democrats are ""right-wing"" is mostly the result of people fundamentally misunderstanding the major differences between the American political system and the parliamentary systems practices in most other western democracies. The filibuster makes it so, that in practice, any major policy proposal requires bipartisan support. The last time the Democrats had a filibuster proof majority was back in 2009, which they promptly lost in like a year after a special election in Massachusetts. With their filibuster proof majority, the Democrats used it to pass the Affordable Care Act. Say what you will about the ACA, you can believe it didn't go far enough, but I don't really see how it be remotely construed as ""right-wing.""

Meanwhile, the majority party in most parliamentary systems is able to pass pretty much whatever they want with a 50%+1 majority, provided they can get their party/coalition in line. The logic people seem to employ when they argue that the Democrats are right-wing are they identify progressive policies that America doesn't have that other countries do have like single-payer healthcare, universal parental leave, etc and then reason backwards to conclude that the Democrats must be right-wing. But the Democrats explicitly call for many of these policies in their party platform, it's just virtually impossible to pass most of these things because of the Senate filibuster. 

As an additional note about healthcare, it's worth pointing out that many European countries do not have nationalized, single-payer systems use a mix of private and public healthcare options. The big examples are Germany and Switzerland. Even countries with single-payer systems like Canada still use private health insurance for prescription drugs and dental work. Just because the Democrats seem confused on whether they want to whole-heartedly embrace as Sanders style ""medicare for all"" isn't prima facia evidence that the party would somehow be right-wing in Europe. 

Finally, the Democratic party is arguably much further to the left on many social issues. One of the biggest examples is abortion. It's not clear what, if any, restrictions on abortion that Democratic party endorses. In states that have a Democratic trifecta in the governor's mansion and supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature, abortions are often effectively legal at any point, provided you can find a sympathetic doctor to provide a ""good-faith"" medical judgement that completing the pregnancy would harm the health of the mother. 

The viability standard set in Casey of around 24 weeks gave the US a significantly more generous timeframe to get an elective abortion, whereas most European countries cap it [around 12 weeks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1268439/legal-abortion-time-frames-in-europe/). Many European countries also require [mandatory counseling or waiting periods](https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/European-abortion-law-a-comparative-review.pdf) before women can get abortions, something the Democrats routinely object to. For comparison, the [position](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/europe/germany-abortion-recommendation-intl/index.html) of the Germany's former left-wing governing coalition was the abortions up until 12 weeks should be available on demand, provided the woman receives mandatory counseling and waits for three days. If a Republican state set up that standard in the US, the democrats would attack it relentlessly as excessively draconian, which is precisely what they've done to North Carolina, which has an extremely similar [abortion law](https://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/en/abortion-guide-access) on the books.",ThePurpleNavi,358,0.6100000143051147,890,1734984967,2024-12-23

backwards to conclude that the democrats must be right wing but the democrats explicitly call for many of these policies in their party platform it s just virtually impossible to pass most of these things because of the senate filibuster as an additional note about healthcare it s worth pointing out that many european countries do not have nationalized single payer systems use a mix of private and public healthcare options the big examples are germany and switzerland even countries with single payer systems like canada still use private health insurance for prescription drugs and dental work just because the democrats seem confused on whether they want to whole heartedly embrace as sanders style medicare for all isn t prima facia evidence that the party would somehow be right wing in europe finally the democratic party is arguably much further to the left on many social issues one of the biggest examples is abortion it s not clear what if any restrictions on abortion that democratic party endorses in states that have a democratic trifecta in the governor s mansion and supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature abortions are often effectively legal at any point provided you can find a sympathetic doctor to provide a good faith medical judgement that completing the pregnancy would harm the health of the mother the viability standard set in casey of around 24 weeks gave the us a significantly more generous timeframe to get an elective abortion whereas most european countries cap it around 12 weeks many european countries also require mandatory counseling or waiting periods before women can get abortions something the democrats routinely object to for comparison the position of the germany s former left wing governing coalition was the abortions up until 12 weeks should be available on demand provided the woman receives mandatory counseling and waits for three days if a republican state set up that standard in the us the democrats would attack it relentlessly as excessively draconian which is precisely what they ve done to north carolina which has an extremely similar abortion law on the books
1jt1a4b,"CMV: The hands off protest will do nothing to stop or even slow Trump, and will largely accomplish nothing.","The large scale protests of the last 20 years seem to all be complete failures. Occupy wall street didn't fix the finance system. BLM didn't improve policing. The womens march didn't improve access to women's healthcare.

This new movement will do the same. 

I think that in order to make a meaningful change your goals need to be specific and tailored. For example a good protest would be to go to a state house demanding that you want to be a sanctuary state. A bad protest would be to go to a state house to let them know how much you disagree with the president. 

A more effective (not the most effective) path towards social change would be email campaigns. You can directly tell the individual in power what change you want to see and why you want to see it and that you will not vote for them if this change is not enacted.

Any perspectives would be appreciated especially evidence towards what makes a social movement successful vs unsuccessful and examples.

1j42ycb,CMV: Islam is an Arab imperialist ideology that kills native cultures and Arabizes them.,"Coming an exmuslim from Iraq (Arabized country) I always felt Arab imperialistic religion by nature, especially after learning how countries like Iraq, Egypt, Morocco, Palestine and Syria lost a thousands of years of culture due after being Islamized. Arabic and Arabs were a small minority outside the Arabian peninsula and none existent in north Africa, after Islamization they ""magically"" became overwhelmingly represented in the MENA region.

- Islam request Arabic
Islam forces its followers to pray and read Quran in Arabic compare to Christianity where you read the Bible and pray in your native language, Arabic is also the language of heavens in Islam, you need to say the shahada in Arabic to covert to Islam and even adhan (call for pray) is also required to be Arabic. Non-Arab Muslims uses Arabic terms like Inshallah, subhanallah, astaghfirallah and etc. 


-You need to be a descendants of Qurayshi Arabs to be a Caliphate

Many sunni hadiths have emphasized the Caliphate need to be descendants of Qurayshi (Muhammed's tribe for those who don't know) which's why a lot of Muslims don't consider non-Arab caliphates like ottomans to be a legit caliphate and anti-ottoman Arabs have used the fact they aren't Quaryashi to delegitmize them as true Caliphate, and there's many non-Arab Muslim rulers like Saladdin who fit all requirements of being a Caliphate except the fact that he was a Kurdish instead of being a Qurayshi Arab. 


- Islam is heavily Arab centric 

You required to do pilgrimage to two cities in Arabia as a Muslim, you idolize Arab figures like Omar, Abu bakr, Othman and Ali and Islam tells you to be live and act like prophet Muhammed (an Arab man), you follow an Arabic calender system, you required pray towards Mecca, non-Arab Muslims wear Arabic clothes like hijab, abya and thawb and non-Arab Muslims give their children Arabic names while non-Arabic names are looked down on.

1b88t8t,CMV: a major reason men don't talk about their feelings / problems is that nobody wants to hear it,"I feel like there's a bit of a double standard regarding men talking about our feelings and struggles.

On one hand, it seems like society at large is just *begging* us to open up more. Indeed, we're blamed for not doing so.

But it seems like most of the time when we do, people (women) get *really* uncomfortable. Either it's seen as scary, or you're being a baby, or you need to take that shit to therapy (which is a euphemism for ""stop bothering *me* about this""), or you're unfairly placing a burden of emotional labor on the women in your life.

Bottom line, the message I'm getting is: nobody wants to hear it. If you want a sympathetic ear, you can pay someone to listen, but don't burden anyone else with your scary male feelings.

1bxoafx,CMV: Labeling sexual/romantic orientations has gotten out of control and is now leading to more problems than solutions,"Hear me out bc ik This is a super hot topic but I asked a mod and its alright as long as this is not about gender identity which I understand and it is not

Please note:

I labeled it 18+ as im sure triggering stuff will be mentioned

Also i swear i don‘t mean to be offensive, I am sure that my argument is missing others povs hence this sub so keep that in mind

And I am specifically talking about romantic/sexual orientation, not gender identity. That is something way different and should not be discussed here at all.

So:

I will always stand for peoples right to exist in peace, surrounded by love and care regardless of your sexual/romantic orientation. I myself am in the pride community.

But I am genuinely so annoyed of reading on forums and subs, ‚i like this person, does that mean I am x orientation?‘

I understand that giving yourself a label is important because it helps you understand yourself. And I understand that back then when not much was known in the mainstream world, labels helped with identification and explanations

But I also see it as just being very limiting and honestly just leads to more confusions than solutions

For instance me:

 I am (i think) asexual and aromantic, I have never once been properly attracted to anyone and honestly find sexual/romantic intimacy to be a no-go. But then there are few moments where I do get to know someone and I do envision a life with them, and so now im here like…wtf am I

And so I googled all the possible labels for my feelings and found out sapiosexual is a thing, and demisexual and so on. That too me is soo damn confusing now… because why do I need a Label that says ‚attraction for me starts when i gained an emotional attraction and such‘. I actually had people argue with me and say ‚if im ace then I can‘t feel sexual attraction period‘ and then others say ‚well no bc xyz exceptions exist‘ so which oen is it? We don‘t know, these labels habe created this divide now

Now im sure the first counter argument is going to be, you don‘t need one but let others have one if they want to

But i say: how do we know if they want one? Maybe they are surrounded so much by labels that they think they need one. Maybe a world can exist where you are who you are and love whoever you want (plz dont bring up nonsense like peddos i ofc don‘t mean them) and thats that.

Like i feel like it is these labels that brings up so much conflict, because labels then come with stereotypes and being boxed in.

And as I mentioned before in my case, I see the pride community struggle with this actually bc we now not only have gay or lesbian and such but we now have graysexual, semisexual etc. because we came to the realization that humans are all on a spectrum, and instead of leaving it at that we feel the need to label everything

I guess for my point to stick, we would have to agree on us being on a fluid spectrum which I understand not everyone agrees on. But if we (those who support it) know there are people who like x person of one group but also sometimes y person of another group, then why do insist on creating new labels rather than just saying ‚ ok this person likes this one but also this person‘ and thats that.

I hope my point is clear, feel free to ask for clarifications.

17qex82,"CMV: The narrative that ""a voice actor should only voice characters of the race they belong to"" is not only nonsense, but has the potential to horribly backfire on the people promoting it if applied to them without excuses and compromises.","Let's deconstruct this narrative. It's very straightforward. A voice actor of race X, should only voice a character also of race X. If character is of race Y, then only a voice actor of race Y should play that character.  
I disagree with this. To me, voice acting comes down to the quality of your voice, your ability to take on the role and voice it. To me the narrative being put forward is nonsense, because what it is pushing goes against what I see voice acting as. It promotes the disqualification of a so many talents, based on solely on their race. We demote ourselves from choosing quality to now choosing skin color.  
Now to be clear, I am not saying people of a race are not good at voicing certain races or their own race. Rather, I am arguing that we are making quality less of a priority. And to illustrate this, let me entertain two scenarios:  
1. A white voice actor is chosen to voice a person of color because they are better at voicing the \*\*character\*\*, than the voice actor who is of the same race of the character, \*\*but\*\* is not as suited to the character as the people making the content desire.  
2. A \*\*non-white\*\* and \*\*non-Japanese\*\* voice actor, is chosen to voice a \*\*Japanese\*\* character in an anime, even though the character is not their race, because their voice acting ability is better suited to that character than the available Japanese voice actors who are the character's race, but not as suited for that character.  
I support both of these scenarios for being reality, because in both cases the \*quality\* of the persons ability to voice the character is what took priority. If the voice actor is chosen for a character who is also of their race, it should be because they had the talent to voice a character, who is not just defined by their skin but their way talking, the \*personality\* of their voice, which the actor was able to bring out better than other actors. Not because they were the same race as that character.  
Now I also made the claim in my view that the narrative has the potential to \*backfire\* on the people promoting it. And to explain it quite simply I need only point out that the people promoting these views... A themselves voicing characters not of their race. I don't even mean voicing non-human-like characters. I mean human beings or human equivalent characters who are of a certain race/ethnicity, being represented by voice actors who are not that race/ethnicity.  
For example:  
Mr SungWon Cho. Ethnicity: Korean.  A prominent promoter of this narrative.  
His roles include:  
Vice Admiral Legrange - Anglo-French ([86](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24481))  
Kajinosuke Tanikaze - Japanese ([Records of Ragnarok](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24643))  
Koutaro Tatsumi - Japanese ([The Honor Student at Magic High School](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=23898))  
This nice video reel of his roles [on his Twitter (X) account](https://twitter.com/i/status/1717961644331208749). Plenty of non-Asian, let alone non-Korean roles there  
Ms Shakyra Dunn. Ethnicity: Black as per her twitter. An example I wish to put forward of who this would backfire on.  
Her roles are all compiled her by herself which saved me a lot of trouble:  
[On her instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx5yR18uKwW/)  
Now if we were to apply this narrative upon them, then they would have to relinquish a great number of roles, not because they can't voice them well, but because they are not the same race/ethnicity. And I am willing to bet that a good number of the voice actors who promote this narrative would also lose a large portion of their roles, because they do not fit the race of the character. In other words, it would backfire on them.  
The only way to avoid this backfiring would be to make exceptions and compromises. To say ""Oh well but this is different...."". No if we are going to go with this, then we need to go all the way. If this narrative is going to dominate voice acting then everyone should face the consequences that come with it, regardless of their race. And that would be the biggest backfire for the entire voice acting community for what I believe is absolute nonsense.  
It would reduce voice acting to be a race based profession first and talent based profession second. The mighty Kratos from God of War (Norse) is voiced by Christopher Judge, a man who has my favorite voice for Kratos in the series. But Kratos is Greek. And since voice acting is supposed to be done by the matching race.. Oh well I guess Christopher loses his job huh?  
I hope I have properly illustrated my view. And hope to see if anyone can find a way to change my view. You may change it by convincing me that voice acting should be about race first and talent second and that this would not backfire on the people promoting it.",Delusional_Gamer,805,0.8799999952316284,324,1699421910,2023-11-07

1j4hzc5,CMV: Conservative’s metric for the success of a policy is primarily based on how much it makes the people they hate suffer.,"As a liberal I look forward to progressive policies because I believe they will help people or the planet. However, I just don’t see the same kind of justification from conservatives. From what I can tell, they either remain ignorant about the policy, as their media often intends, or they fully support it just because “their team” is winning and the “other team” is losing. On social media I constantly see conservatives being absolutely delighted by “liberal tears” and salivating over people “kicking and screaming” or “seething” etc, or about how much the perpetrators are “owning the libs”, “winning” or “dominating” etc. Why is the primary measure of the effectiveness of a conservative policy how miserable it makes people? I ask this out of genuine curiosity, what exactly has Trump done for you besides hurt the people you hate? I recognize that social media distorts my view, but whenever I dip my toes in a conservative dominated online space, my takeaway is that for the average voter, they care a lot more about what something doesn’t do for others instead of what it does do for them. I don’t want to believe that people are really like that, but that’s what I’m leaning towards, so CMV.",SmellsNoice,1058,0.7699999809265137,862,1741218910,2025-03-05 17:55:10,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1j4hzc5/cmv_conservatives_metric_for_the_success_of_a/,3,2025,0.09605076031068811,0.2066234701223902,0.15133711521653917,cmv conservative s metric for the success of a policy is primarily based on how much it makes the people they hate suffer,as a liberal i look forward to progressive policies because i believe they will help people or the planet however i just don t see the same kind of justification from conservatives from what i can tell they either remain ignorant about the policy as their media often intends or they fully support it just because their team is winning and the other team is losing on social media i constantly see conservatives being absolutely delighted by liberal tears and salivating over people kicking and screaming or seething etc or about how much the perpetrators are owning the libs winning or dominating etc why is the primary measure of the effectiveness of a conservative policy how miserable it makes people i ask this out of genuine curiosity what exactly has trump done for you besides hurt the people you hate i recognize that social media distorts my view but whenever i dip my toes in a conservative dominated online space my takeaway is that for the average voter they care a lot more about what something doesn t do for others instead of what it does do for them i don t want to believe that people are really like that but that s what i m leaning towards so cmv,0,cmv conservative s metric for the success of a policy is primarily based on how much it makes the people they hate suffer as a liberal i look forward to progressive policies because i believe they will help people or the planet however i just don t see the same kind of justification from conservatives from what i can tell they either remain ignorant about the policy as their media often intends or they fully support it just because their team is winning and the other team is losing on social media i constantly see conservatives being absolutely delighted by liberal tears and salivating over people kicking and screaming or seething etc or about how much the perpetrators are owning the libs winning or dominating etc why is the primary measure of the effectiveness of a conservative policy how miserable it makes people i ask this out of genuine curiosity what exactly has trump done for you besides hurt the people you hate i recognize that social media distorts my view but whenever i dip my toes in a conservative dominated online space my takeaway is that for the average voter they care a lot more about what something doesn t do for others instead of what it does do for them i don t want to believe that people are really like that but that s what i m leaning towards so cmv
1excrxx,CMV: The semaglutide craze is going to evetually lead to an opioid-like health crisis,"This has been bothering me for a while and I want to know if I'm missing something here.  Right now though, no matter how I look at I'm convinced that the push of Ozempic/Wegovy and similar GLP1 drugs is going to end in a public health crisis in the vein of opioid.

Everything I see about these drugs is overwhelmingly positive to the point of feeling delusional.  The claimed benefits not only include weight loss, but apparently decreasing cardiovascular risk, treating addiction, reducing arthritis, cutting diabetes risk, etc.  It reads like an advertisement for scam supplement at times, as it can apparently cure everything.  I don't think I've ever seen anything regarding potential long term risks, or the consequences of suddenly ceasing use of it.  This is a drug that works on a core metabolic process and the body really likes to try and maintaining homeostasis by up- and down-regulating things.  As these drugs stimulate the release of insulin and suppress glucagon by imitating the GLP1 peptide, it seems logical to think the body might reduce it's response to this compound over time to maintain it's idea of homeostasis.  So if someone were to suddenly lose access to it?  It seems reasonable to think this would lead to a lack of insulin and overproduction of glucagon - a diabetes-like metabolic problem.

Also disturbing to me is the way the drug is being marketed as an option for everyone and being offered outside of doctor's offices.  This is an expensive monthly injection that's meant to be taken for life, yet it's being advertised for weight loss of around 30 lbs (by the pharma company itself no less) and is being made available to people through places like Weight Watchers.  What are people supposed to do once they reach their target weight?  Studies show that many people regain the lost weight after stopping, so what's next once the target is hit?  And I don't believe places like WW really care about using ""lifestyle changes"" with it, otherwise they wouldn't be offering it as a primary option vs other methods failing first.

At the root of all my concern is the absolutely insane financial incentive that pharma companies have to get as many people on the medication as quickly as possible, regardless of consequences.  At $3000 a month and intended to be permanent, every new patient represents tens or possible hundreds of thousands of future revenue.  Multiply that by tens of thousands of patients, and it's enough money to make Bezos jealous.  And with how we saw Purdue get off scot free from the opioid crisis, what incentive is there for these companies to care about the consequences?  It's free money and at worst they'll pay a fine that dwarves the profit these drugs are making them.  Instead, they have every incentive to hide any negative outcomes related to these drugs and push positive narratives at every turn.

Every one of these details leads me to believe this semeglutide craze will lead to a massive public health crisis on the level of opioid.   The hallmarks are all there:  a supposed miracle drug that makes huge profit for their manufacturers with no risk for consequences, being pushed on as many people as possible regardless of their needs, and potentially disastrous consequence if the medication is stopped which is a huge risk due to it's price and the lack of coverage by many insurance plan.  If this medication were to suddenly become unavailable to many people for whatever reason, there could be massive public health consequences that, per usual, the common citizen would bear the brunt of through suffering for those who are affected, and high costs for those who are not.

I'm more than open to hearing different perspectives, as I'm sure I might be missing something here.",shiningdialga13,398,0.7799999713897705,277,1724203043,2024-08-20

The experience of being a young person in europe is completely different from the glamourous tourism people outside of it think, i’ve yet to meet a single Gen-Z European who’s genuinely optimistic about their future, any talented european that gets an oppurtunity still moves to UAE or US despite critisizing them, its almost hypocrytical.

Germany shut down its last nuclear plants during an energy crisis, most of europe is riddled with green hypocrisy and net-zero laws that have punished the young by shifting jobs elsewhere. The UK is collapsing. France is politically gridlocked and bleeding talent, even skilled youth are fleeing abroad. But these are just symptoms.

* Real wages (esp PPP adjusted) in China’s urban regions are now catching up to and in some cases surpassing Southern and Eastern Europe.
* Germany, has negative real wage growth and rising living costs. Half of Germans reportedly have less than €1,000 in savings.
* Italy’s youth unemployment is above 20%. Spain’s isn’t much better. Entire generations are locked out of home ownership and capital accumulation, it offers nothing more than being a vacation spot.
* Pension and healthcare systems are unsustainable, with shrinking workforces forced to support massive aging populations.
* Tax burdens on the working-age population are brutal, especially for those who want to start a business, invest, or build anything new.
* There is an increase in anti-free speach and censorship across europe sometimes in worse ways than america, im not fear mongering like JD Vance but the actual publications by the EU and the UK's new online safety act.
* It is a region of various languages, internel divide (even within its own countries) so it will never be united against common problems.

It is cliche, even a meme to suggest or say the US and China are racing ahead in AI, semiconductors, biotech, and deep tech. Europes startup founders are some of the most miserable ive see and are always just looking to find their comapny then flee to the US or Middle East where they are treated better. US, China and even India manufacture the EVs, solar panels, and servers europeans will depend on while contributing little back and only get poorer.

India, Vietnam, and even Indonesia are leapfrogging Europe in digital infrastructure, fintech, and manufacturing investment. While europe will head nowhere.

And before anyone jumps in with “but Trump”, yes, the US has its dysfunctions. But the US still has a clear path to course-correct. Presidents change. Policy swings happen. Beneath all the noise, America’s industrial base is real, it still builds planes, chips, AI models, biotech, rockets. It has deep capital markets, global reserve currency status, and still attracts the world’s top talent still lives to go towards US salaries. europe's problems are far more structural.

Convince me I’m wrong, or give any points that make it look like this region of the world can still deliver for the young - CMV.",Xtergo,793,0.7300000190734863,327,1753807331,2025-07-29

16ii0kt,CMV: Bad moms don't deserve their child's forgiveness and their presence in their lives,"Even if they change later in life, what happened can't be erased and they basically ruined a huge part of their child's life. 

I know there might be a debate about what a ""bad mom"" is. I would say that if a person considers that their mom played a big part in their unhappiness during their childhood/teenagehood then she is to be considered a bad mom. 

My mom is definitely one of them and I don't think she deserves to have a good relationship with me today, or any relationship at all. 

Around the age of 11 she stopped being affectionate with me. No more hugs, no more kisses, no more cute nicknames, no more good nights in bed.

In middle school, she would criticize my only friend and call her weird, and told me I was becoming weird like her (I became insecure)

She called me an idiot very regularly during that period, compared me to others, belittled me.

She constantly criticized and judged my personality, the way I ate, the way I spoke, the way I behaved, what I talked about, the fact that I was close to my friends...

She wasn't the type of mom who talked to me, asked me how my day was at school, laughed with me, was affectionate, smiled at me... when she spoke to me it was only criticism and negativity.

She was always grumpy and moody. I very rarely saw her smile at home and she always looked at me with side eyes and disgust when I passed in the living room. Because of that, I stayed in my room a lot and almost never spoke to her. She blamed me a lot for that.

I wasn't allowed to invite friends. I wasn't allowed to go to my friends' houses. I wasn't allowed to go out with friends after school, on weekends or during vacations even when I was 20 (or even alone, I never went out except to go to school). I wasn't allowed to have a phone or wear makeup until I was 18. She never gave me money so I couldn't buy anything on my own until I was 18 when I was finally financially independent. I was never allowed to cut my hair. I wasn't allowed to dye my hair either. I wasn't allowed to go to parties even when I was in college. I wasn't allowed to have a boyfriend, especially if he wasn't Muslim. My life was just school and home, I could only go out with my older sister or my mom and my aunt. I would do things behind her back and lie to her because all I asked was ""no"" 90% of the time. No concerts, no trips, no movies, no sleepovers, no beaches, no festivals, no parties, no birthdays even when my friends invited me. She deprived me of many of the pleasures one experiences at that age.

Every time I did things that went against her, something she didn't like, she became very aggressive. She screamed, insulted me (whore, crazy, scum..), grabbed my neck or my arms aggressively, squeezing, spat on me and became even crazier when I held her arms to stop her from hurting me. Sometimes she closed the shutter and the door of my room and forced me to sleep even at 7-8 p.m. after her tantrum.

Her grudge would last for days. She would remind me that she is the mother and that she has all the rights, that I must respect her and do everything she says. She threatened me that I wouldn't go anywhere and that if I tried to escape, she would find me. She had her crazy moments where she would tell me that she wished that I would get sick and disappear so that she would be alone, or that if I tried to escape, she would take a knife and  would stab me and go to jail for that. She's already had phrases like ""you're not my daughter anymore"" (when I was in middle school) or ""shouldn't I have aborted that one?""  in a fit of anger.

Today I'm 26 and I no longer live with her. She changed and became nicer, she has made efforts to sort things out and wish to have a good mother/daughter relationship with me. I still don't think she deserves to have me in her life. Same for other moms who did similar things. I know it's hard being a parent but nothing justifies abuse and toxicity.",Petite_Curious,618,0.8799999952316284,308,1694696840,2023-09-14

1ks9e3g,CMV: Abortions should be legal because they do no appreciable harm when done properly,"I've thought about this topic from both sides and I honestly can't think of a legitimate argument for why abortion should be illegal. I'll present the arguments I've heard against abortions here and refute them in the ways I would argue.

""Every human being should have the right to life."" A human fetus really hasn't started living a human life yet. It's never laughed or cried or even seen the light of day. And if the mother wants to abort it, then it hasn't formed any meaningful social connections either. If I were to ask you what day you would consider to be the first day of your life, you'd say the day you were born, not the day you were conceived. If you're not even living a human life yet then you're not really a human being yet.

""Wait, but you just called it a human fetus back there! You're admitting it's a human being and therefore  it has the right to life!"" No, a human fetus isn't a human in the same way that human hair or a human hand isn't a human. Just because something is made of human cells doesn't make it a human being.

""A fetus is a baby, and you wouldn't kill a baby."" Calling a fetus a baby just goes against common sense.  No one in their right mind would place smashing a petri dish with a human IVF embryo in it and killing a baby on the same moral tier. It just goes against intuition. If you google image search ""baby,"" you would never find a picture of a fetus no matter how long you scrolled for.

""My religion says life begins at conception."" And I believe that it doesn't. We're both allowed to have our own beliefs, but beliefs don't form rational arguments. Logic and reason do.

""Abortion scars women for life."" Not getting an abortion when you don't want to give birth is even more scarring. No one gets an abortion because they like doing it, it's just the lesser of two evils.

""Some women die during abortions."" The WHO says ""Deaths from safe abortion are negligible, <1/100 000 *(5).* On the other hand, in regions where unsafe abortions are common, the death rates are high, at > 200/100 000 abortions."" I imagine unsafe abortions occur in places where abortion is illegal, but that's just my supposition. Either way, death by abortion doesn't seem like a huge issue.

I could list other counter-arguments I can refute, but I'll stop there. At the end of the day, women (and everyone for that matter) should be able to control the inner workings of their bodies as much as they can. That much seems like a common-sense human right to me. And lastly, what kind of a life could you expect to have if your own mother didn't want to have you? Abortions ensure that only babies that would be cared for and that are wanted would come into being. So being pro-choice isn't just being pro-choice, it's also being pro-love.

17kw23j,"CMV: As a black man in America, I'm tired of society and media making me feel ""special"" because of something I can't control such as my race","Now personally , I like a lot of black media, like African American actors, artists, and filmmakers.

But at the same time I wish for everyone to be equal in the sense that we all value each other  for our talents, abilities, actions and what we can control about ourselves MORESO than our social identities that we can't control (yet have shown perseverance and freedom from oppression in the past)

Like for example, I'm an artist. Art is my passion. 

And while I can't control how people react to my passion, I personally wouldn't like people saying ""he's one of the black artists that shows an example in the black community by doing XYZ""

Because it turns my passion and creativity into a social/political conversation just because of my race. Instead of just seeing me as an artist


I know what I'm claiming is too much to ask for. Since due to our history, experiences, marginalization, and culture we have to ""stand up for our black king and queens""

1fzuimf,CMV: Florida Real Estate Will Collapse Within The Next Few Years,"The insurance crisis in Florida already quite bad, and with Milton, it's [poised to get even worse.](https://www.fox9.com/news/hurricane-milton-florida-homeowners-insurance) 

We're reaching a tipping point where either homes become completely uninsurable or the insurance becomes so expensive that homes start losing value. 

This will precipitate a death spiral, where homeowners start to realize that buying or owning a home in Florida is not a good investment and they'll leave the state. Supply will increase as demand falls. 

I will add one caveat here and it's that the federal government could step in and rescue Florida through a subsidized insurance scheme, but the politics of this are really iffy. Republicans would be most incentivized to save the state, but such intervention is also against Republican orthodoxy. 

So, CMV, barring some federal intervention, the Florida housing market is cooked.

19apxuf,CMV: plastic surgery is largely unnecessary and people need therapy more than plastic surgery,"Excluding outlier cases such as deformities or deformities caused by accidents, or anything pertaining to health. I think plastic surgery has a place of usefulness.

I am talking about the casual pursuit of more and more plastic surgery + fillers + Botox - particularly in young people who spend a lot of time on social media.

Social media has caused an unhealthy obsession with appearance. There are communities on Reddit where people exclusively pick each other apart, tell them what kind of plastic surgery they need, then encourage posters to come back and update with their new look.

This is kind of nuts. Changing your face to look more like everyone else in pursuit of a beauty ideal (and those ideals change) makes me think people need therapy to help them feel comfortable in their skin more than they need to change themselves to fit the ideal.

I don’t think it’s “acceptance” to accept that people get plastic surgery to fit some societal ideal. Acceptance would be just accepting people as they are and not placing such an insane value on being “attractive” (a shifting goalpost tbh).


Edit to clarify point: 

I think I need to clarify - I am not saying it should be illegal, that people who get cosmetic surgery should be judged, or that they shouldn’t be allowed to get surgery.

I’m saying my view is that a lot of the demand for cosmetic procedures is inherently unhealthy and driven by social media and looking at images of ourselves more than we were ever meant to.

I am not referring to necessary plastic surgery to correct issues, fix real deformities or problems that would affect how someone is treated (that includes cosmetic surgeries!!) 

I am talking about young people on the internet trying to get buccal fat removal or double jaw surgery to meet an ideal they see on the internet.

186p36m,CMV: a Trump 2024 presidency would irreversibly alter United States politics & partisanship as we know it,"Loaded post, I know and this is a bit heady, but please let me explain. I’m from the Midwest and Trump supporters are everywhere. They frequently claim that Trump is being hit with “political” legal attacks during these court cases. They claim this like they’re saying something outrageous. They also act like Trump wouldn’t do the exact same thing against his opponents, or worse if re-elected. 

First off, obviously the cases against trump are completely political. He’s the former president, and I don’t see any republican plaintiffs. However, when I mention politics, I’m looking past the superficial ideological divide and I’m analyzing the actual mechanics and science behind “power” and mass influence. The study of politics is just that, the discipline studying the application of power and exercise of authority. Any system with more than one individual is political because there will be a power imbalance. There cannot be two chefs cooking the same meal unless one delegates. This is power and its political. 

In my view, systems of power become contentious when you have powerful individuals supported by other powerful people, institutions, or undifferentiated masses. Such as a political party. 

Trump is currently being tried for many different alleged violations, both civil and criminal. Trump was a former and recent president of the United States. This dynamic is completely unprecedented in the balance of Anglo-American politics. Trump could have murdered 3 people with a knife on camera and admitted to it and prosecution of him would still be political. It’s inescapable that the act of exercising government power against trump in the form of judicial oversight is an act of political power. It’s irrelevant how much or how little Biden, or any democrat, has to do with any prosecution. Its political no matter what.  Submission to any court and its laws, under any circumstances, is a recognition of political sovereignty. The very act of Trump, an important political figure, being accused and called to answer for his crimes is political. 

Therefore, if Trump somehow wins in 2024, as a felon or otherwise, it is unthinkable that he would be able to restrain himself from challenging the political systems that tried to hold him accountable in the first place. Even if he wanted to restrain himself. Again, it’s politics, if he is in power he will exercise it, his supporters would command him to do so regardless, right? Given the inherent political nature of the proceedings against him, it seems obvious to me that Trump would use government power to do something equally political. 

Since the nation is already in uncharted waters trying to prosecute a former, contentious president, if Trump wins in 2024, there is an incredibly likely chance that Trump would respond in kind and legally prosecute his enemies or otherwise exercise political power in ways unseen in American political history. 

This post is a prediction, one that I feel many Trump supporters are either ignoring or they want it to happen. Either way change my view and make it easier for me to live in TrumpTown and not be so cynical of US politics. Please poke holes in my appraisal of the situation. Please give me a reason to change my view and expect a boring election cycle in 2024. 

TL;DR: Trump is being accused of felonies and other crimes. Political or not, it’s all politics and it’s unthinkable that if re-elected, convict or otherwise, Trump will launch legal actions against his perceived enemies and a dramatic political battle, unprecedented in scope and scale, will erupt if he wins 2024.",Ok-Story-9319,1024,0.7300000190734863,1186,1701263573,2023-11-29

18624kk,CMV: far-right Muslim extremist organizations like Hamas should be treated the same way we treat far-right Christian extremist organizations.,"Progressive intersectionality has been a net asset for many causes including the struggle of oppressed minorities, women, LGBT groups, etc...

However, in recent times, it has lost its focus by trying to include supporting far-right religious extremists such as Hamas, a terrorist organization, all in the name of intersectionality.

It is mind-blogging that many progressive activists to this day still refuse to condemn Hamas' rape, torture, and beheading of innocent civilians. Some even go so far as to deny that rape and gender-based violence even took place.

**It shouldn't be difficult to stand with innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians while still condemning Hamas' terrorist attacks.**

If a Christian Copt Terror group in Egypt, started to rape, torture, and behead innocent Muslim civilians in the name of Jesus Christ, you can be sure that these same progressive activists would condemn them.

They would ignore the context of the oppression that the Copt minority has suffered at the hands of Egypt's Muslim majority Government and instead, they would only focus on ""Christians killing Muslims"".

But when Muslims kill Jewish people or Christians, many progressive activists refuse to condemn Hamas all in the name of intersectionality.

1cagnk2,"cmv: Unless you are happy with yourself, you will never be happy in a relationship","I've come to the realization that unless I am happy with myself overall and no longer in a position of identity searching, that any romantic relationship would be a distraction from that pursuit and would just make me more miserable.

Obviously no one can just be completely 100% happy with themselves,(or there are very few who are), and you have to tick all the to do lists in life before settling with someone, that's not what I'm saying.

My point is that unless you are doing the thing you want to do every day, or spending majority of your time doing what you want, you are more unhappy than happy overall. Getting into a relationship is a distraction you gave yourself from the fact you are not happy overall, but think this person will be my happiness, which is wrong imo.

1go56j6,CMV: “educate yourself” is the intellectual version of “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” and is elitist,"In my opinion, your worldview is not something you “build yourself with your own two hands” it’s largely given to you.  This is why there are liberal areas where liberal families live and raise liberal kids, same with conservatives.  

I can’t stand people with their self righteous “educate yourself” BS.  These people act like they get up at the 4 am every day to read everything under the sun to make sure they choose the correct moral stance on a given issue, and anyone who hasn’t looked into it or come to the right conclusion is less than.  It’s honestly pathetic and it’s pure mental bias.  

A lot of you might be surprised to see how you would have voted, for instance, if you had come from deep conservative territory.  

It’s especially frustrating because half of the “high moral ground” that many of my leftist contemporaries claim is that they are EMPATHETIC TOWARDS PEOPLE.  My leftist contemporaries have sympathy for the issues that come with poverty in cities but if you’re broke and from the country and you didn’t vote blue, you’re a piece of shit.  It’s ridiculous.  

If someone comes from an area with deep ideology and is able to reject that culture and worldview and build their own, because they disagree with it, that’s amazing and those people should be commended, but people who can’t do that (vast majority of people) should not be demonized.  

If you are proud of your worldview and you think it makes you a better person, believe me you are lucky to have it and it’s a gift.  You didn’t work for it and no one owes you applause, and you’re dead wrong to make villains of people less fortunate.

1lyo4fr,CMV: Epstein files scare Trump for reason(s) other than the fact Trump himself is in them.,"For anyone apart from the most deluded cult members it is obvious and public knowledge that Trump is in the files, flight logs and had a close relationship with Epstein.  

Anything that is worse than that could be easily destroyed or covered up well enough for the all too willing cult to accept the Fox news spin of it and move on. Teflon Don has managed to get his following to accept so much already he could certainly find some way to spin his relationship with Epstein such that they would contort themselves to believe even the most ridiculous excuse. 

The way Trump, Bondi and other are handling this now is digging themselves into a massive hole and that screams that there is a far bigger risk. 

I DON'T think Trump is primarily worried about his own inclusion.  I think the bigger problem is dozens of other powerful paedophiles he is somehow obliged to protect.  

I think others that are on the list or in the evidence have a lot more risk than Trump does, as he is essentially immune to investigations, lawsuits, divorce and can brush off a lot of public scrutiny and he has the full power of the DOJ to illegitimately defend him or shut down threats. 

Given how many times Trump was on the flights, at the island and cohorting with Epstein over many years he must have also been interacting with other Predators and paedophiles. Those people must know a lot more than what is in the Epstein evidence and if they go down they can spill serious evidence on Trump.   These are likely many very powerful and (ironically) credible people with lots of resources to go scorched earth on Trump if he feeds them to the wolves 

Trump is likely trapped in a position where he knows he has to protect all the other Epstein paedophiles for fear of what a few of them could expose about his own involvement. 

It is also highly likely that Trump has extorted many of these people already and many may have been forced to support his campaign.  At least a few of them would be smart enough to have insurance. 

This also correlates to his statement regarding the files and the risk to 'people'. 

This better explains the otherwise irrational actions of Bondi etc. Than simply protecting Trump himself which could be done in a less destructive way.

1dbv1el,CMV: The latest IDF raid to rescue four hostages debunks the “targeted operation” myth,"In the Gaza War, the IDF recently rescued four hostages. The operation was brutal, with Hamas fighters fighting to the death to prevent the hostages from being rescued, and civilians caught in the crossfire. Hundreds of civilians died and Israel was able to rescue four hostages. Assuming the 275 civilian death number is accurate, you get an average of 68.75 Palestinian civilians killed for every Israeli hostage recovered. 

This strongly debunks the myth of the so called “targeted operation war” that many on Reddit call for. Proponents say Israel should not bomb buildings that may contain or conceal terrorist infrastructure, instead launching targeted ground operations to kill Hamas terrorists and recover hostages. This latest raid shows why that just isn’t practical. Assuming the civilian death to hostage recovered ratio remains similar to this operation, over 17,000 Palestinian civilians would be killed in recovering hostages, let alone killing every Hamas fighter. 

Hamas is unabashed in their willingness to hide behind their civilians. No matter what strategy Israel uses in this war, civilians will continue to die. This operation is yet more evidence that the civilian deaths are the fault of Hamas, not Israel, and that a practical alternative strategy that does not involve civilian deaths is impractical.

1j8qwwt,"CMV: If Democrats Gain Full Control, They Have Every Right to Prosecute Republicans and Their Allies Who Have Weaponized Government for Political Gain","The current American administration has demonstrated a relentless campaign against anything they consider progressive or left-leaning. Through their attacks on Democrats, the weaponization of the DOJ, and even the reported revocation of security clearances for law firms representing figures like Jack Smith, they have set a dangerous precedent.

For years, Republicans have accused Democrats of “weaponizing government,” yet under this administration, we’ve seen an actual systematic effort to punish political opponents, undermine legal accountability, and shield powerful conservative figures from scrutiny. If Democrats regain control of the presidency, Senate, and House, they not only have the right but the duty to bring to account those who have engaged in corruption, abuse of power, and the dismantling of democratic norms.

This should not be done out of pure political retaliation but as a necessary step to uphold the rule of law. If individuals like Trump, his enablers in Congress, and powerful conservative figures like Elon Musk have engaged in unlawful activities, they should face real legal consequences.

1lo9q2s,CMV: Most people who claim to be pro-life are just pro-birth.,"Most people who claim to be pro-life actually only care about the fetus not being aborted. They do not care (as much or perhaps at all) about the baby and the family after it is born. 


Many people who are pro-life actively support politicians and policies that harm low-income working-class families or even just have opinions contradicting their “pro-life” stance. 


Cutting funds/ shutting down programs such as Medicaid, WIC, SNAP, early childhood education, etc., actively harms families and children. 
There are tons of people who look down on single mothers or parents trying to get child support from the other parents. 

Some other examples of the fake pro-life stance include:
There has been a push to stop free school lunches as well as to defund public schools. 
The denial of science (vaccines, global climate change). 

I understand that the political movement of pro-life is about stopping abortions, and I agree. The goal isn’t about the care of the child after it’s born. That doesn’t mean you’re actually pro-life.

1iw2evt,"CMV: If the United States Wants to Raise Funds, It Should Start by Taxing Religious Organizations, Namely Churches","The U.S. has a massive national debt and frequently debates how to raise revenue—whether by increasing taxes on individuals, businesses, or the wealthy. But one major source of untapped funds is religious organizations, particularly churches, which collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and generate billions in untaxed revenue each year.

Religious institutions currently benefit from 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, meaning they pay no federal income tax, property tax, or investment tax, and members can deduct donations to them. This is justified under the principle of separation of church and state, but I’d argue that exemption is outdated and unfair for several reasons:

1. Churches function like businesses. Many run multi-million-dollar enterprises, own vast real estate holdings, and operate profitable ventures (e.g., book sales, TV networks, investments). Yet, they are taxed less than the average small business. Why should a megachurch be tax-free while a struggling coffee shop pays full taxes?
2. Some churches engage in political activity. Under IRS rules, tax-exempt organizations must refrain from endorsing candidates, yet some churches routinely influence elections and policy. If they want to play politics, they should pay taxes like PACs do.
3. Fraud and lack of financial oversight. Unlike other nonprofits, churches do not have to disclose financial statements. This lack of transparency enables fraud, mismanagement, and wealth hoarding under the guise of religious exemption. Examples include televangelists living in mansions and pastors flying private jets.
4. Taxing churches would be a fairer way to raise revenue. Instead of increasing taxes on middle-class Americans or small businesses, taxing religious organizations could generate tens of billions annually, easing the burden on everyone else.

To be clear, I am not advocating taxing individual donations to religious causes, nor am I saying all churches are corrupt.

1l9v6g2,"CMV: There is no good reason, with the exception of special needs cases, to homeschool children in the US. Homeschooling is, again with that one exception, always a manifestation of the parent's desire for control, not of the child's best interest. Notes and Caveats in Body","The one notable exception is for a child with special needs, if you live in an area where the local public school system does not have adequate staff/training/facilities to educate your child. In that case, I would agree there is a good reason to homeschool. Otherwise, there are none. 

Common Objections-

1- But my school district sucks!: Unless you are a world class educator, which you probably aren't, even a fairly mediocre or overworked school system will still be able to provide your child a better education through the network of dozens of trained professionals your child will have access to over a given school year, than you can alone. Is the height of hubris to thing that you are equal to or better than a math teacher+ reading teacher+ history teacher+ social studies teacher+ science teacher+ gym coach+ guidance counselor, etc etc etc, even fairly mediocre ones. You are not.

2- But our schools are dangerous!: Then send them to a private school. Not all private schools are for rich people, there are middle class and even working class private schools. The tuition to these school will still cost less than the expense of your own training to properly educate, the materials, and your own time spent being a home educator rather than being out working. I get that maybe you WANT to be a stay at home educator, but again, if the best interest of your child and there education is genuinely your priority, even if your public schools are terrible, you will do better by them if you work a job and spend that wage on private school tuition. You are not a replacement for a school. If you are in a situation where you cannot afford even a low end private school, then you are not in a position to be able to afford to do a better job than your public school would anyway.

3- But my children will be exposed to (insert thing I don't like): Good! Social skills and learning how to navigate mixed company settings and social spaces with difference influences and cultures and ideas is just as important to be a properly adjusted and functioning adult as the book learning. In some contexts even more so.

  
What will change my mind: 

Some scenario, other than the single notable exception I listed above, where I am convinced that being homeschooled will actually result in a better education and better intellectual, emotional, and personal development than enrollment in a public school would, WHILE ALSO being a situation where a low end private school is also out of the question.

1l9tl0s,CMV: The only likely end to the conflict is for Gaza to be wiped out entirely.,"This is NOT a discussion of the morality of Israel’s or Hamas’s actions. It is a view of what will happen and how the war will end. 

On October 7th I immediately thought that Israel would use the attacks as justification to completely destroy Gaza (and eventually occupy the land). Today, as the conflict continues and many attempts at ceasefires have failed, I believe that Israel will continue the war until Gaza is completely destroyed and its people relocated or killed. 

It seems to me that all attempts at peace are fruitless and I haven’t seen any probable solutions proposed. Furthermore, it seems that the US will continue to provide weapons and support to Israel at least for the rest of Trump’s term.

1c5mgu1,CMV: Everyone would be better off if women were the ones who were expected to make the first move.,"Attention from the opposite gender is like water. Men are desperately thirsty for it, while women are drowning in it.   
Most women don't like being approached randomly in public or being confessed to, while I don't know a single man who wouldn't appreciate being approached. The ""men remember compliments for years"" things is true for a reason. 

On top of that, there is also the aspect of safety, and the current societal expectation of men approaching women has resulted in women being seriously hurt or even killed due to rejecting a man. Women basically have to fear for their safety every time a man approaches them. Again, if women were the ones to approach, this wouldn't be an issue. 

If women were expected to approach, they could go out and not worry about guys hitting on her, and men can finally take a break from always having to be the initiator. Everyone wins. 

&#x200B;

""*b-but men have always been the ones who approach! It's natural!""*

1f0aj6r,"CMV: In the ""would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck"" question, picking one horse-sized duck is a strikingly stupid choice","I know I'm like 8 years late on this meme, but I feel like it faded away without reaching much of a consensus and it made me feel like an insane person because the answer seemed so incredibly obvious. So here I am dredging it up again, like an insane person. First, some priors about the hypothetical I'm addressing: 

* Let's discount the oft-cited cube square law which posits that a horse-sized duck would immediately collapse under its own weight. In the spirit of the hypothetical, let's assume physically viable animals whose strength and bone strength etc. has scaled linearly with their mass to allow for normal function. 
* Let's assume we have no weapons, or at least no sophisticated, pre-made weapons. I'm working from an assumption that we're totally unarmed, but if you want to argue a situation where we could pick up a stick or a rock or something I'm happy to engage with that as well. 
* You are allowed to wear normal clothing, e.g. let's say you are given 10 minutes in a normal department store to pick out an outfit. I'd be okay entertaining a scenario where you're naked, too. My main point is that you don't have access to armor or anything (though i think having armor would make the answer even more obvious.) 
* The animals in question fully understand that they are in a fight to the death against you. 
* The question is very specifically about who you think you are most likely to defeat; any questions about gaining glory or other social consequences are outside the scope of this argument. 

Okay so on to my position: 

**Picking a horse-sized duck is not only obviously wrong, it's downright foolish.** 

Let's start by focusing on the horse-sized duck and (an incomplete list of) the opportunities it has to kill us vs. how we could kill it:

* The duck would be *much* stronger than you - strong enough to break your bones with a peck or claw attack. Strong enough to kill you outright with a properly-landed blow. 
* The duck's beak is huge, rigid, and would be capable of devastating bludgeoning damage. 
* The duck's beak would be plenty big enough to grab you by the head, a limb, even your torso. 
* The duck's beak would likewise be able to bite you with great force, possibly enough to break your bones. 
* The duck has claws on its feet that it could use to rip you open. 
* The duck can *fucking fly*. And even if we agree for some reason that it can't, it's still a massive animal that can kill you in a single blow. 
* You have basically no method to kill the duck unarmed. Maaaybe you could get lucky and break one of its legs, but you're still left with an extremely large, angry animal that can easily break your bones by just flailing around. The duck's neck is too large and strong to be choked out. Possibly you could stuff yourself or objects down its throat until it chokes? But even then, you are attempting a precise maneuver against a massive animal that is also trying to kill you. 

Now to contrast let's examine the duck-sized horses:

* The horses would be *much* weaker than you - any individual horse would be unable to do much more than lightly push you a bit. 
* The horses' mouths, while formidable in a horse-sized animal, would be too small to even gain purchase on most of your body. When naked, you'd run the risk of maybe getting the tip of a toe or finger bit off, or maybe a light pinch on your shinbone or something. If you were could dress yourself, wearing basically any clothes at all would render you nigh-invulnerable to this attack. 
* That leaves their kicks, which would be an annoyance but unlikely to do any real harm besides light scratches and bruises. Their hooves are not particularly sharp and are certainly not designed to puncture or rip skin. The blunt-force damage that makes a normal horse so dangerous would be rendered basically moot by their relatively small size and lack of strength. 
* Horses are not particularly intelligent animals and are not capable of any kind of meaningful tactical collaboration. This massively mitigates the potential problem posed by the large number of horses. 
* Similarly, horses cannot climb or grapple you, so your exposure would be limited to a few horses at any given time. This fact, combined with the previous point, means that there is very little threat of being overwhelmed and dragged down. At least until you have already worn yourself out to the point of exhaustion. 
* Horse legs are notoriously spindly and fragile. While scaling them down would reduce the risk of broken legs, it would still be pretty easy to break their limbs and incapacitate them. 
* You could kill or at least incapacitate the horses with normal kicks and stomps. You could easily pick up a horse and snap its neck, especially given the extra leverage offered by their long heads. A hundred is a pretty big number, but every individual horse would be trivially easy to defeat. The main challenge here is cardio, not fighting skill. 

Please note: I am NOT saying that I, or anyone, would obviously defeat 100 duck-sized horses every time. I am very specifically talking about the choice between 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck: on this question, I think the average human has about a 99% better chance of defeating the horses than they do the duck and I seriously question the judgment of anyone who picks the alternative.",tsaihi,630,0.8799999952316284,433,1724520014,2024-08-24

1jsmudk,CMV: There were no protestors paid to attend the protests across the us yesterday.,"Looking at the republican subs as well as their media I've seen a lot of talk about paid protestors. Rogan famously quipped that protestors were being paid $1400 each to protest.

I've seen zero evidence of this occurring. 

Some criteria for my claim. 

What is a paid protestor? Someone who is paid to go to a protest. 

What this doesn't cover? Organizations do exist and often engage in logistics. They may print signs or bring in sound equipment, etc. This is different than the claim that protestors were being paid to attend the protests across the us yesterday. 

Organizers are not protestors. Here's why. J6 was organized by women for America first. A pro trunp organization led by Amy Kremer. This group worked on securing permits, booking speakers, getting a stage and sound system, etc. This does not mean that Amy Kremer paid those present at January 6th, and the January 6ers were also not paid protesters. 

Women for America first is also not a non profit organization which means it is far less transparent than other groups that are doing similar logistics. Unlike many non profits. The origins of the funding for Women for America first have never been disclosed. Really. We have no idea who paid for January 6. However, even in this extreme example I wouldn't argue that J6ers were paid protestors. 

What would change my view? Evidence anyone attending the protestors yesterday was being paid for protesting.

17dzdxk,CMV: It's not unreasonable to expect people who get cold easy to accommodate people who get hot easy,"So, there's this age-old battle between people who run cold and people who run hot. It sucks for anyone to be at an uncomfortable temperature, but, logically, it's the people who run hot who should be accommodated.

The options for improving comfort are very limited when you're overheated. A fan can help, but only so far, and there's only so much clothing you can remove before you're making a scene. 

On the other hand, people who are cold can bundle up. They can wear heavier clothes, put on a sweater, or even run a small space heater. 

There's also more health risk for the hot person. Feeling overheated triggers sweating, which can cause rashes and dehydration. Unless it's ridiculously cold, being cold isn't the same kind of health risk.

So, for these reasons, I believe a person who runs hot should be the one accommodated. I believe if you're someone who runs cold and you insist on being accommodated at the discomfort of a warmer person, you're inconsiderate and illogical.",Zogonzo,1496,0.8500000238418579,1316,1697998150,2023-10-22 13:09:10,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17dzdxk/cmv_its_not_unreasonable_to_expect_people_who_get/,10,2023,0.14396674324472158,0.31557475401967844,0.2297707486322,cmv it s not unreasonable to expect people who get cold easy to accommodate people who get hot easy,so there s this age old battle between people who run cold and people who run hot it sucks for anyone to be at an uncomfortable temperature but logically it s the people who run hot who should be accommodated the options for improving comfort are very limited when you re overheated a fan can help but only so far and there s only so much clothing you can remove before you re making a scene on the other hand people who are cold can bundle up they can wear heavier clothes put on a sweater or even run a small space heater there s also more health risk for the hot person feeling overheated triggers sweating which can cause rashes and dehydration unless it s ridiculously cold being cold isn t the same kind of health risk so for these reasons i believe a person who runs hot should be the one accommodated i believe if you re someone who runs cold and you insist on being accommodated at the discomfort of a warmer person you re inconsiderate and illogical,0,cmv it s not unreasonable to expect people who get cold easy to accommodate people who get hot easy so there s this age old battle between people who run cold and people who run hot it sucks for anyone to be at an uncomfortable temperature but logically it s the people who run hot who should be accommodated the options for improving comfort are very limited when you re overheated a fan can help but only so far and there s only so much clothing you can remove before you re making a scene on the other hand people who are cold can bundle up they can wear heavier clothes put on a sweater or even run a small space heater there s also more health risk for the hot person feeling overheated triggers sweating which can cause rashes and dehydration unless it s ridiculously cold being cold isn t the same kind of health risk so for these reasons i believe a person who runs hot should be the one accommodated i believe if you re someone who runs cold and you insist on being accommodated at the discomfort of a warmer person you re inconsiderate and illogical

1hz98ck,CMV: corporate lobbying should be a heavily restricted activity and corporations should have no say in politics. ,"Im posting this because i know someone here will enlighten me on why it is actually not directly harmful to a society for non human entities with non human interests to have a say in lawmaking and politics.  

I don’t see why it makes sense for a corporation to have a direct say in policy making in a democracy. A business owner himself may have interests and employees may have interests and they should on behalf of themselves have a say but a corporation sending lobbyists to do whatever magic it is that they do to sway politicians to do one thing or another doesn’t make sense to me if the governments chief concern is the people who vote/citizens. 

Enabling business entities to lobby officials on their behalf which inevitably is in the interest of profit seems like it compromises a politicians dedication to the people. Politicians are people after all and can be swayed , i think it makes sense to lessen the amount of possible swayers who are not the people governed. 

The lobbying and the exorbitant funding of these campaigns clearly sways the public officials interests a bit further to the interest of  private ownership benefit than i care for. It seems like it has produced an environment where the people are in a battle with corporate interests . 

The business entities seem to function as incredibly powerful super voters who have an advantage over the very group governments are supposed to function for. The government is feeling more and more like a privately owned interest group for business entities and less like a public good chiefly concerned with the people. 

Am i being a doomer? Am i mistaken somewhere? Let me know.

1644dcp,CMV: The government should pay people €100k euro if they donate a kidney to someone who needs one,"I'm going to use numbers from my own countries as reference:  

In Belgium, a year's worth of dialysis treatment costs the government roughly €60k per year per patient. Meanwhile, a kidney from a healthy live donor lasts on average between 15-20 years with relatively minimal other costs after transplant.   
So let's assume 15 years of dialysis saved on average that would mean that 1 transplant saves the government roughly €800k (assuming €100k in total for surgery + medical follow-up of donor and recipient).   

I think to encourage more people to donate their kidney, the government should pay people €100k. Even with such a large payment, it would still lead to big savings for the government. And obviously, the recipient would benefit greatly as well due to massively increased QoL.    

And because I know people will bring up the health impacts on the donor: I don't consider this to be enough of an impact to not implement this plan. A thoroughly screened and healthy donor sees an extremely limited (if any) impact on their life. A month after the surgery, the donor can resume life as normal without any restrictions whatsoever. And the odds of developing kidney failure later in life are also very small when properly screened.    

And even if kidney failure is developed, there would be plenty of donors ready to give a kidney due to the high payment involved.",SuckMyBike,428,0.800000011920929,428,1693272003,2023-08-28 20:20:03,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1644dcp/cmv_the_government_should_pay_people_100k_euro_if/,8,2023,0.02713051088502352,0.10247180225581953,0.06480115657042153,cmv the government should pay people 100k euro if they donate a kidney to someone who needs one,i m going to use numbers from my own countries as reference in belgium a year s worth of dialysis treatment costs the government roughly 60k per year per patient meanwhile a kidney from a healthy live donor lasts on average between 15 20 years with relatively minimal other costs after transplant so let s assume 15 years of dialysis saved on average that would mean that 1 transplant saves the government roughly 800k assuming 100k in total for surgery medical follow up of donor and recipient i think to encourage more people to donate their kidney the government should pay people 100k even with such a large payment it would still lead to big savings for the government and obviously the recipient would benefit greatly as well due to massively increased qol and because i know people will bring up the health impacts on the donor i don t consider this to be enough of an impact to not implement this plan a thoroughly screened and healthy donor sees an extremely limited if any impact on their life a month after the surgery the donor can resume life as normal without any restrictions whatsoever and the odds of developing kidney failure later in life are also very small when properly screened and even if kidney failure is developed there would be plenty of donors ready to give a kidney due to the high payment involved,0,cmv the government should pay people 100k euro if they donate a kidney to someone who needs one i m going to use numbers from my own countries as reference in belgium a year s worth of dialysis treatment costs the government roughly 60k per year per patient meanwhile a kidney from a healthy live donor lasts on average between 15 20 years with relatively minimal other costs after transplant so let s assume 15 years of dialysis saved on average that would mean that 1 transplant saves the government roughly 800k assuming 100k in total for surgery medical follow up of donor and recipient i think to encourage more people to donate their kidney the government should pay people 100k even with such a large payment it would still lead to big savings for the government and obviously the recipient would benefit greatly as well due to massively increased qol and because i know people will bring up the health impacts on the donor i don t consider this to be enough of an impact to not implement this plan a thoroughly screened and healthy donor sees an extremely limited if any impact on their life a month after the surgery the donor can resume life as normal without any restrictions whatsoever and the odds of developing kidney failure later in life are also very small when properly screened and even if kidney failure is developed there would be plenty of donors ready to give a kidney due to the high payment involved

1f2pjou,CMV:  Democrats are getting overconfident about the possible debate between Kamala and Trump. ,"I wanted to make this post for quite a while but couldn’t find time to respond to people who will respond to my post.

Before the first debate, I read a lot of left-wing blogs which kept saying Biden would trounce Trump in the debate.  At that time itself, I felt that he should not debate Trump because there is no benefit for him and nothing that Trump says will hurt him with his base. In other words Biden has all to lose and Trump has nothing to lose.

The debate went magnitudes worse than I had ever feared and it culminated with Biden, eventually, dropping out. 

 I now see the same thing with people eager for a Kamala vs Trump debate. I stand by my position that Trump has nothing to lose in this and Kamala has everything to lose. Trump could get on stage, crap his pants, and sling his poo at the audience and he would still not lose a single supporter. Granted, he won’t gain any supporters from such behavior either . Kamala on the other hand could make a mistake like she did against Tulsi in 2020 and could destroy the campaign as it is. 

So there you have it. That’s my view. Change it.

1gvof1v,CMV: Pedo hunters/ Vigilantes are NOT doing the right thing ,"
You know, the videos on social media going viral of “pedo hunters” luring men in and then proceeding to humiliate them in public/ beat them and 9/10, they don’t even call the police. So what’s the point of even luring them out if you’re not even going to call the police and report them? Any reason you can think of just leads to these pedo hunters getting some sort of gain/satisfaction from it, and not that they actually care about stopping pedos. If they actually cared about stopping it, they’d have the person arrested instead of just humiliating them and then letting them go to potentially do the same again. 

1: They go viral 
2: They have an excuse to physically assault someone without legal consequences, because they know these guys they’re assaulting won’t call the police because of what they’re being accused of could also get them arrested 
3: They get to look like “hero’s” for beating up a dude who is accused of trying to meet up with children. 

Let me make myself clear, i have absolutely no sympathy for pedophiles. I wish they’d all just drop off the face of the earth. However, this affects much more than just the men caught in these stings. It affects their wives if they have one, their children, their siblings, their family. Anyone closely associated with this person who goes viral will be humiliated aswell. 

Not to mention, some men in this situation actually didn’t know the person was underage until they were already at the meet up location: 

https://amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/25/vigilante-paedophile-hunters-online-police

Some have died 

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/world/europe/netherlands-pedophile-hunters.html

Either call the police immediately after luring these men out, or sit back and let the police catch them themselves. This whole “look at me i’m a hero because i just beat up a guy and shaved his head and made him eat dog food because he tried to meet a 15 year old boy” isn’t justice, it’s just unnecessary violence. Besides, it isn’t their place to deliver justice, it’s a judges place.

1kh5kf9,CMV: Not understanding how stuff works is fine. Not trusting the experts is the problem.,"I often read and hear people berating the ""average voter"" for being too stupid to understand the economy, or the science, and thus voting for the most evil morons possible, i.e. Republicans. The thing is, the average democrat voter doesn't really understand stuff either. 

Sure liberal voters are on average more educated than conservatives, but to truly understand policy, healthcare, and geopolitics, you need a college degree on that topic or, really delve in the research with an exceptionally critical mind for years.

17bx7k4,CMV: Religious ethics have no place in policy making,"I reently had a discussion with a redditor right here in a post about critique towards islam. It quickly evolved in a discussian about ethics itself. The redditor said, that he believes that secular ethics are not really defendable and lack substance, since, without a god, there is nothing to stop yomeone from murdering everyone for the benefit of spreading their own genes. 

I hurled some secular ethical principles against him, and i am fairly sure, at the moment, that those are absolutly superior and more appliable towars almost every ethical problam that one can face, especially when deciding on laws and policies. 

I would go furhter and say i currently hold that believe that every law influenced by religion is inherently unjust towards the percentage of the population that does NOT hold the religious views that influenced that law. 

I personally get the impression that being religious is fine, and ordering your life according to religious rules is fine as long as those rules remain private and confined to your own life. Although i still believe that someone adhering to secular ethics because they WANT to be a good person seems like a better person to me (and safer) than someone only holding back on the mayhem because they are afraid of divine punishment (because there might be ways around drawing the deities ire, for example by targeting a group that is singled out as ""evil"" in a holy text)

1i59te1,CMV: Conservatives Will Dominate America for the Next ~20 Years,"Note: By “conservatives,” I mean both Republicans and conservative Democrats.

Trump’s win in November was resounding in every way except the final popular vote tally. Trump won every swing state, and every state moved to the right. Trump fell short of a true majority of the popular vote and only won it by 1.5 points, but it was still the first time a Republican won the popular vote since 2004. Additionally, Republicans won over millions of voters from majority-Democratic voting blocs.

Many left-leaning people have claimed, falsely, that Democrats lost due to low turnout. In truth, the 2024 election saw the second- highest turnout of any presidential election, and swing states like Georgia and North Carolina saw record turnout. By all metrics, the Harris-Walz team’s attempts to “get out the vote” worked. They successfully got out the vote… for Trump. Indeed, Trump won both Independents and first-time voters. Trump won *because* of high turnout. High turnout no longer benefits Democrats.

All post-election polling has suggested that Republicans are now the more popular party. Overall, America shifted to the right by four points in 2024. One poll found that 43 percent of voters viewed Democrats favorably and 50 percent viewed them unfavorably. Increasingly, Democrats are viewed as affluent, out-of-touch, college-educated elites who ask for votes and never return the favor. Most voters trust Republicans more on the economy, immigration, and crime. The economy and immigration were the two most important issues for voters last year. Most voters support mass deportations, which Trump has repeatedly promised to begin on day one. It’s obvious that MAGA has won over the majority of voters, which is also why Democrats are starting to move towards the center on issues, immigration chief among them.

The shifts among key demographics are even more alarming. Harris barely won a majority of the Latino vote, and most Latino men voted for Trump. Harris won Asians nationally, but Asians in Nevada shifted to the right by more than *50 points*. Democrats may have permanently lost the Muslim vote because Muslims hate ~~Jews~~ ~~Israel~~ “genocide,” and the recent ceasefire deal, in which Trump was apparently instrumental, might be the final nail in the coffin, especially considering Muslims’ social views make white evangelicals seem progressive. That could mean that Democrats will never again win Michigan. Other racial and religious groups, such as blacks and Jews, also shifted to the right by smaller amounts.

However, the most alarming shift is among young voters. According to the AP VoteCast, Harris only won young voters by 4 points; Biden carried them by more than 30. Young men especially are rapidly shifting towards the GOP. The reasons for this shift are debated, though many attribute it to perceived abandonment and/or demonization of men by the left. Also worth noting are the issues that are genuinely worse for men, such as the male suicide rate. For instance, the percentage of college students who are female now is roughly equal to the percentage of college students who were male prior to Title IX, and college enrollment among men is declining. More and more men are opting for trade schools instead, largely due to costs. This is important because college-educated people tend to be more liberal (the so-called “diploma divide”), while tradespeople tend to be very conservative. Lastly, since young voters’ views tend to be the most malleable, it stands to reason that more and more young voters will embrace MAGA.

This shift to the right is not limited to the US. In fact, the West as a whole is moving sharply to the right, largely for the same reasons as the US: the economy and immigration. The Conservatives are all but guaranteed to take control of Canada later this year and were even before Trudeau’s resignation. Although Labour took control of Parliament just last year, its popularity has already plummeted, and Reform UK’s popularity has surged. The SPD is poised to get voted out this year, and the AfD is becoming more popular by the minute. Now, the situation in Europe is different - and frankly, more dire - than the situation here in the States. Europe is currently facing widespread economic stagnation, and European society is being upended by immigration, particularly from the Islamic world. Similarly, largely unrestricted immigration in Canada has inflated home prices and created numerous social issues. As a result, left-wing parties haven’t been less popular since the Cold War, and right-wing populist parties who claim to have solutions are rapidly gaining popularity. Arguably, Trump’s comeback was the final nail in the coffin for the progressivism of the early century. At the time of writing, all signs point to a generation of right-wing dominance of America and the West as a whole.",Emperor_Kyrius,697,0.7099999785423279,1225,1737322633,2025-01-19

1kcxb89,CMV: It takes more faith in Paul to believe in modern Christianity than in Jesus,"When I read the Gospels, Jesus appears as a Jewish teacher preaching repentance, Torah observance, and the coming Kingdom of God. His message was specific, grounded in Jewish law, and aimed at a Jewish audience. There’s no Trinity, no salvation by faith alone, and no outright dismissal of the Law. But then Paul enters the picture, someone who never met Jesus in life and who redefines the entire framework.

Paul’s writings pivot from Jesus’ teachings to doctrines like grace over law, justification by faith, and a divine Christ figure who replaces obedience with belief. It’s Paul who opens the door to Gentiles and pushes a theology that would be unrecognizable to most first-century Jews. Today’s Christianity, especially in its Protestant forms, leans more on Paul’s interpretation than on Jesus’ own words.

To me, believing in modern Christianity requires trusting Paul’s authority and vision more than Jesus’ teachings. That doesn’t sit right with me. I’m open to being challenged on this, but I don’t think the historical Jesus ever intended the religion that bears his name to become what it is now.

1i54zz4,"CMV: People who believe in tarot readings, physics etc are really gullible and stupid ","Physics, tarot readers, mediums etc are all charlatans who con people out of money.
The people they con are usually grieving soma death or in a bad mental space so they subconsciously want to believe the generic nonsense these scammers provide them.


If someone could actually talk to the dead (or dogs, believe me there are people who claim this too) then they would do it for free right?

But instead they charge plenty of money to spread complete lies.

I chatted to someone last night who said ""when my father died last year like 4 days after it I went to a medium and they told me that my father forgives me for working so much""


Like this is such generic and easy bullshit to say to convince a gullible person.

I'm aware some of these people are simply delusional and believe that they actually can do this ( I have friend who's sister believes and I actually believe that she believes) but the majority of these people know they are lying and know they are acting immoral and unethical.

1h7h9y2,CMV: The lack of empathy in the assassination of the United Healthcare CEO is perfectly reasonable both practically and morally. ,"Some things that lead me to this conclusion 

1. United Healthcare was the largest claims denier for healthcare medications and procedures in the USA 

2. This industry results in the preventable deaths of tens of thousands of people every year. 

Therefore, he is directly responsible for the death of tens of thousands of Americans each year. Wanting to see vigilantism against him is at least reasonable at most justifiable.

Also, saving money by denying claims enriched him lavishly. Meaning he would profiteer at the death and suffering of others. Wanting to see vigilantism is also at least reasonable for this, at most justifiable. 

Also I’ve heard:

3.

1e5v5gg,"CMV: Even if a fetus were considered a fully-fledged human, abortion should still be permitted for the mother without limitations according to United States law. ","To start: I am not looking for moral appeals here. “It kills the baby” “it’s wrong” “it’s mean” “you shouldn’t have gotten pregnant” are not arguments against my position. I am arguing within the legal theory of the United States, not within a moral framework for this argument. 

Assumptions: I grant for the sake of argument that an unborn fetus is a human being with all rights that should be accorded to natural born citizen. 

As an aside, in an extreme view of this position I would hold that once viability has been reached, the fetus should be eligible as a tax dependent, a co-rider for carpool lanes, and should have a social security number, etc. Please note that personally I do not feel that this is true, but for the sake of a stronger argument, I am allowing the pro-life side a stronger starting position: ie; granting the fetus full-personhood. 

Argument: The fetus is a human being who cannot survive without a birth. This human will die if they do not leave the womb through a medical procedure: ie, birth. 

This surgery is unique in that it requires a medical intervention on the body of the patient benefitting from the surgery (the fetus being born) but it also requires to consent and cooperation of a third party to be involved in and accept the dangers of the surgery: the mother who is giving birth. The fetus cannot be born, and thus cannot live, without being born by the mother, full-stop. The mother, on the other hand, can continue to live quite easily without going through the dangerous medical intervention that is childbirth. Her life is not endangered by the requirement to give birth, only that she is forced into a binary of doing something about the pregnancy, but abortion is significantly safer than a birth or Caesarean section, and in a purely pragmatic sense is the better option for her own health and wellbeing (assuming she does not want a child)

When taking this into account, the closest analogue I can think of would be a sickly sibling in need of a kidney. You are their only match. Without the kidney, your sibling will die, without question. And also without question, donating your kidney is dangerous, and poses a risk to yourself personally. 
But, while it may be morally wrong, or distasteful to not want to put yourself through the danger of that surgery to save your sibling, it is NOT MURDER TO NOT DONATE YOUR KIDNEY, EVEN IF THEY WILL DEFINITELY DIE WITHOUT IT. You choosing not to undergo a dangerous medical procedure that is unnecessary to your own personal medical wellbeing is not murder, even if that has the direct consequence of the death of another. It would insanity to force you to donate your kidney to a match, in the same way it should be insane to force a woman to give birth to a human. 

In fact, even if you had recently died, if you aren’t an organ donor, your rights to bodily autonomy, even as a corpse, trump your siblings need to violate your bodily autonomy in order to keep living. 

Even if all that was needed to save the person’s life was a single drop of your blood, you cannot be compelled to give it if I don’t want to.

16glz0r,CMV: The right wing's obsession with trans issues is largely because they have nothing else to talk about.,"I'll be honest. I don't know what the hell is going on with the whole trans thing. I think having a thousand genders is silly and alot of the pronoun stuff also seems weird. 

But I just don't notice it in daily life (and I live in a very liberal city). Trans folk are such a small part of the population, but you would think that there's one in every neighborhood, just waiting to break in and mutilate your family's genitals, considering how the right wing talks about this issue online.

I'm sure that there are many who would genuinely take issue with this stuff anyways, but it seems pretty clear that the *obsessive* nature of the right wing's focus on this issue is because it's an easy, convenient one for them to use as a draw.

They can't talk about the economy

They can't talk about civic health or integrity in office

They have nothing else to appeal to voters, but they can run endless, contextless clips of needledicks like Ben Shapiro or Matt Walsh **""ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING""** some blue-haired college sophomore who doesn't know how to formulate an argument yet.

16nnc07,CMV: Bills to weaken child labor laws are undermining the US's advancements in worker's rights,"I believe that certain bills that are being introduced, such as Florida's HB 49 ([https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/49/BillText/Filed/PDF](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/49/BillText/Filed/PDF)), are a concerted effort to take away worker's rights. 

Florida law currently prohibits 16 and 17-year-olds from working before 6:30 a.m., after 11:00 p.m., or for more than eight hours when there is school the next day. The bill would do away with those restrictions, as well as the requirement for a 30 minute break after four consecutive hours of work.

I believe these types of laws would allow employers to pay less and offer less benefits, under the guise of providing 'spending money' jobs to teenagers.

1htrerd,CMV: cryptocurrency is not a good investment. ,"Yes its price has increased dramatically, but so did the price of tulips in the 1600s.

There is literally no use for this commodity. Invest in stocks or bonds and your investing in future earnings or the ability of a company to pay you back. I’m not a fan of gold as an investment but at least it has some practical use.

The use of crypto as a currency completely defies the definition of currency as it doesn’t hold a stable value.

It’s infuriating that so many people have lost loads of money on “shitcoins” backed by the wealthy and famous. These were obviously pump and dump schemes yet very few are held accountable.

1ew7ow3,"CMV: If You Vape Indoors in Public, You're a Dick","I feel like this should be common sense, but I still see a lot of people doing this and I want to hear the other side of the argument: why do you think it's okay to vape indoors in a public place?

I've seen this a number of times near me: a patron at a bar or restaurant sneaks a puff from their vape as soon as the bartender or server turns their back. It's easier to do, since it's quicker than lighting a cigarette and the vape pen can dispense just one puff unlike a cigarette. Clearly they know it's not allowed, or they wouldn't take measures to hide it too. 

The only argument I've heard is that ""it's just water vapor"", but that's just not true. The vape smoke has nicotine in it (that's sort of the point), as well as other chemicals to give it it's flavor/scent.

It may not be common knowledge, but the chemicals themselves have harmful effects on the lungs. If the smoker isn't aware of that, that might be (comparatively) understandable. However, they should be well-aware of the second-hand nicotine smoke they're blowing at people. Ignoring this seems selfish, and therefore dickish.

Are other people as bothered about this as I am? Is there a compelling reason why vapers can't just go outside like normal smokers do, outside of basic selfishness?",Riddle-Maker,609,0.75,582,1724088429,2024-08-19 12:27:09,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ew7ow3/cmv_if_you_vape_indoors_in_public_youre_a_dick/,8,2024,0.04693140794223827,0.13942884569234462,0.09318012681729144,cmv if you vape indoors in public you re a dick,i feel like this should be common sense but i still see a lot of people doing this and i want to hear the other side of the argument why do you think it s okay to vape indoors in a public place i ve seen this a number of times near me a patron at a bar or restaurant sneaks a puff from their vape as soon as the bartender or server turns their back it s easier to do since it s quicker than lighting a cigarette and the vape pen can dispense just one puff unlike a cigarette clearly they know it s not allowed or they wouldn t take measures to hide it too the only argument i ve heard is that it s just water vapor but that s just not true the vape smoke has nicotine in it that s sort of the point as well as other chemicals to give it it s flavor scent it may not be common knowledge but the chemicals themselves have harmful effects on the lungs if the smoker isn t aware of that that might be comparatively understandable however they should be well aware of the second hand nicotine smoke they re blowing at people ignoring this seems selfish and therefore dickish are other people as bothered about this as i am is there a compelling reason why vapers can t just go outside like normal smokers do outside of basic selfishness,0,cmv if you vape indoors in public you re a dick i feel like this should be common sense but i still see a lot of people doing this and i want to hear the other side of the argument why do you think it s okay to vape indoors in a public place i ve seen this a number of times near me a patron at a bar or restaurant sneaks a puff from their vape as soon as the bartender or server turns their back it s easier to do since it s quicker than lighting a cigarette and the vape pen can dispense just one puff unlike a cigarette clearly they know it s not allowed or they wouldn t take measures to hide it too the only argument i ve heard is that it s just water vapor but that s just not true the vape smoke has nicotine in it that s sort of the point as well as other chemicals to give it it s flavor scent it may not be common knowledge but the chemicals themselves have harmful effects on the lungs if the smoker isn t aware of that that might be comparatively understandable however they should be well aware of the second hand nicotine smoke they re blowing at people ignoring this seems selfish and therefore dickish are other people as bothered about this as i am is there a compelling reason why vapers can t just go outside like normal smokers do outside of basic selfishness
1cadgf3,CMV: There has never been a good representation of Arab people in American media ,"I am Lebanese-Canadian and I struggled so much as a kid never seeing my Arab culture represented correctly or even just seeing Arab people always play the villains or terrorists in movies and tv shows. Still to this day I think any Arab character I’ve ever seen in popular media has been incredibly inaccurate or racist.  I think people veiw the Arab countries as too much of a controversial subject to put into media as a main character hero or protagonist. Anytime Americans see depictions of Arab culture their brain Immidiatly associates it with war, terrorism, and Islamophobia. No positive depictions of Arab people in popular media is only continuing the anti Arab narrative. When I was in middle school I had people classmates asking me and my siblings if we were a part of ISIS. Positive Arab representation would help squash this racism so fast I feel. I want to have my opinion changed because I would love to see some people say examples of accurate Arab representation that I’ve never seen before. But I have never seen any therefore it’s my opinion. 

Some caviats: 

1. I am specifically talking about popular western media so projects made by the USA/canada/europe not films that were made in Arab countries
 
2. I am not saying I hate the original Alladin but as much as I loved it as a kid it is incredibly flawed and their “representation” is just racist stereotypes. I have a lot of beef with the alladin live action remake because they put no effort into making it actually representative of Arab countries and cultures and characters so I just count that movie as a tasteless cash grab with no actual attempt to do any proper representation.

3. Indian/East Asian films and shows don’t count. I am specifically talking about Arab countries like Lebanon, Iran, Egypt, Morocco for example. I want to give Ms. Marvel kudos for being really good Muslim and Pakistani representation but I can’t count it in this because I’m talking about Arab in particular. 


The closest thing I’ve seen of popular proper Arab representation is Moon Knight. The main charachter isn’t Arab just the setting so I don’t count it. But the Arab music is fire so it gets kudos from me. The work they did to make the setting accurate was enough to make me happy. I want my opinion to be changed because I would LOVEE to see some people put from good Arab representation media in the comments and prove me wrong. In order for it to count, the main character, protagonist, or hero has to be an accurately represented Arab character, preferably in an Arab country or setting. Side characters can also MAYBE change my opinion depending how relevant they are to the media. The whole point is it’s proper representation not just a token Arab character that has zero depth.

15f26d4,CMV: Neopronouns are pretentious,"Before I get roasted by everyone just hear me out. I am a liberal, I am not transphobic and I respect trans people and trans rights. I also respect if female presenting people want to go by he/him/they/them and if male presenting people want to go by she/her/they/ them.

What I cannot stand are neopronouns like xe/xem/xyr, ze/hir/hirs, and ey/em/eir. You can't just make up all of these little words and expect people to remember and use them. I get that some people are non-binary, and that's fine by me!

18805hr,CMV: Saying 'Yeah' isn't disrespectful,"When I was younger I was in a group and we were having a discussion with the leader, an older guy. He asked me something and I said “Yeah” but before I could complete what I was saying he interrupted and said “yes”. I didn’t really understand what he meant but later he asked something again I said “yeah” and again he interrupted me saying “The proper term is yes. You should speak respectfully to people who are your elders. Do you say yeah to your mother” to which I replied “yeah. I’m not gonna change how I talk to make you feel better”.  
  
I’ve seen this happen a few times through my life both with myself and others. Saying yeah or any other way of speaking isn’t disrespectful. It’s just a way that a person has learned to talk and it doesn’t show respect or disrespect. The context of what they’re saying does.

16hxvf8,META: Transgender Topics,"# The Rule Change

Beginning immediately, r/changemyview will no longer allow posts related to transgender topics. The reasons for this decision will follow. This decision has not been made lightly by the administration of this subreddit, and has been the topic of months of discussion.

# Background

Over the past 8 months, r/changemyview has been inundated with posts related to transgender topics. I conducted a survey of these posts, and more than 80% of them ended up removed under Rule B. More importantly, a very large proportion of these threads were ultimately removed by Reddit's administrators. This would not be a problem if the topic was an infrequent one. However, for some periods, we have had between 4 and 8 new posts on transgender-related issues per day. Many days, they have made up more than 50% of the topics of discussion in this subreddit.

# Reasoning

If a post is removed by Reddit or by the moderators of this subreddit under B, we consider the thread a failure. Views have not been changed. Lots of people have spent a lot of time researching and making reasoned arguments in favor of or against a position. If the thread is removed, that effort is ultimately wasted. We respect our commenters too much to allow this to continue.

Furthermore, this subreddit was founded to change views on a wide variety of subjects. When a single topic of discussion so overwhelms the subreddit that other topics cannot be easily discussed, that goal is impeded. This is, to my knowledge, only the second time that a topic has become so prevalent as to require this drastic intervention. However, this is not r/changemytransview. This is r/changemyview. If you are interested in reading arguments related to transgender topics, we truly have a thorough and complete treatment of the topic in this subreddit's history.

# The Rule

Pursuant to Rule 4, any thread that touches on transgender issues, even tangentially, will be removed by the automoderator. Attempts to circumvent automoderation will not be treated lightly by the moderation team, as they are indicative of a disdain for our rules. If you don't know enough to avoid the topic and violate our rules, that's not that big of a deal. If you know enough to try to evade the automoderator, that shows a deliberate intent to thwart our rules. Please do not attempt to avoid this rule.

# Conclusion

The moderation team regrets deeply that this decision has been necessary. We will answer any questions in this thread, or in r/ideasforcmv. We will not entertain discussion of this policy in unrelated topics. We will not grant exceptions to this rule. We may revisit this rule if circumstances change. We are unlikely to revisit this rule for at least six months.

Sincerely,

The moderators of r/changemyview",LucidLeviathan,373,0.6200000047683716,1910,1694636928,2023-09-13

1bq7d5u,CMV: Casual sex doesn’t have to be superficial,"Most people see casual sex as this superficial thing where you’re just using another person to satisfy your sexual needs. And maybe that is the way many people see and engage in it, but I don’t think it has to be that way. 

At its best, sex is fun, playful. It requires curiosity, openness, presence. It is pleasant and valueable in itself, like playing a game. You’re getting to know and connecting with another person in a very intimate way. And if not, then you are doing sex wrong. 

An argument for casual sex being superficial is that it doesn’t last long. But I don’t think that only long-term connections are valuable. We wouldn’t say that of a friendship or romantic relationship after it ends. 

The other argument may be that it has to be superficial because if it’s not, then you catch feelings and want more. But we don’t say that of say friendships, although it also may and does happen. But we don’t tell people not to connect too much with their friends lest they catch feelings.

So there isn’t anything inherently superficial about casual sex, although many and perhaps most people do practice it that way.

1f8d5lm,"CMV: Broadway would never allow a “Book of Mormon” style, satirical play on the Quran and neither would most Muslims","Say what you will about the LDS church but they at least have a good sense of humor about themselves. While the play is actually a love letter — in many ways — organized Christianity from atheists, it still does have many biting criticisms of the Mormon church and it takes having a somewhat of a thick skin to take them all with a smile. 

I don’t think this would be the same with Muhammad and Quran. In part because the God of the Quran is a lot more oblique and mysterious, the connection people feel with him is displaced to Muhammad instead. Hence the treatment of him as if he is god, not just a mortal man who’s his messenger. 

All this to say, there would be tons of public protests all over the world, bomb threats and gun threats in the lead up to opening day of the show. But, I think in all honesty it would be more outside America than within it. American Muslims, though they might be more upset with the blasphemous message and disrespectful tone, are pretty liberal overall and not much different from American Christians. Worldwide im sure there would be lots of “death to America and the gays on broadway” chants too. 

Nevertheless it would be an extremely volatile, toxic issue the pick-me Mercedes mujahideen type liberals who would lose their mind because they’d have to choose between treating Islam like Christianity conservatives or being “one of the good ones.” But if you’re in America, I can’t speak for anywhere else, part of the buy-in is being okay with people making fun of your religion.

1e2hcyj,CMV: Most Highschoolers and College aged kids are virtue signaling when it comes to the Israel-Palestine conflict.,"Now I don't think supporting Palestinians is the wrong choice. But I think a lot of people have just jumped on the bandwagon and started yelling about it without ever knowing what they really are standing for. 

Most people chanting ""From the river to the sea"" or other phrases like this do not even know the meaning of what they are saying. Not to mention that these statements are usually inflammatory coming out of these people's mouths. People scream these at protests but refuse to acknowledge any other point of view as having a sliver of validity, because a different opinion just equals wrong here. All this does is create more hate between the two sides when both sides can't talk about it without being accused of any number of hateful words. If on average more people were tolerant of people with different views on this subject, and tried to educate, the divide in countries beside Israel/Palestine wouldn't be nearly so bad.

Most people on both sides also don't hope for the possibility of a cease-fire. They want the eradication of a state, one way or another. This has become a war of hate, both in those countries and in others.

Furthermore, the age demographic I am referring to has completely forgotten about the Russo-Ukrainian war. Months ago, it used to be all about saving Ukraine, and now I have not heard a single word about it out of anyone's mouths in months besides during presidential address'/ the debate. Keeping this trend, I would say it isn't out of the realm of possibility that they also abandon this Issue if/when something worse comes along.

1gpm00t,CMV: People should learn English if they’re going to live in the US,"I was surprised this was a controversial opinion to be honest. And no I’m not one of those “people should speak English here people” who gets mad at people for speaking another language to the people they’re with in public. It’s a given that people will always be most comfortable speaking in their first language and language is also culture. I’m also very impressed by those who are bilingual. But I think it’s basic decency for you to learn or be actively trying to learn the predominant language in the country you are moving to. 

This comes up the most with Spanish since the US has a very large Latino/Hispanic population, but it applies to all languages. It’s honestly just a respect thing, if you’re going to come to someone else’s country then you should know the language or try your best to learn enough to make your way around. And I know people are going to say “America doesn’t have an official language” but most of the states do, do most people here would consider that our main language. 

I also think a lot of people protest this because they think American English speakers = white people and learning English is something white people want minorities who come here to do.

1iu4qpq,CMV: the Democratic Party isn’t up for this,"For context, I’ve been politically active my whole life in the US and have pretty much always been a democrat, volunteered for campaigns, flew to Nevada for this election, etc. 

It pains me to say it, but the party isn’t up for the task of dealing with what’s happening right now and is essentially a failed party, in need of near wholesale change at the leadership level. 

Here are the main points:
1- they don’t know how to get media attention
2- they have no actual plan to resist the trump administration 
3- they have no clear articulate message for what they stand for, leaving a vacuum for maga to fill it in for them 

Chuck Schumer’s grand resistance plan was to release a new bill to counter the dismantling of federal agencies (and called it “stop the steal”) and it made zero news. 

The opposition party needs to be rising to the level of intensity in this moment. Sit ins on the house floor, getting arrested if need be. They need to be running ads and other paid media now like if they were running a campaign. They need to be a real political party. 

Every day that goes by without major fight is a lost opportunity and shows that they just aren’t up for it.

1ifxdbo,CMV: Most Anti Immigration people are just racist,"I’ve genuinely never seen an anti immigration/ pro deportations person talk about the “issue” of immigration without using racist talking points or bringing up skin color. Whether it be right wing politicians, people in person or people online. I’ve seen politicians call these people “poison” and “vermin” just like how Hitler talked about the jews, and their main focus is Mexicans and South Americans and Africans. Never have I seen them talk about the thousands of Russians, Western Europeans and Canadians that are here illegally. Plus the propaganda about how all immigrants are rapists and gang bangers, which is just factually untrue. There are so many of them here just working to provide for their kids and then there’s a few bad apples in Colorado and they use it to push their agenda that these people are “dangerous criminals”. Miss me with that. 

On top of that, the MAGA party wanting to change “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America”, taking the Spanish option off of their website and ICE detaining people just for speaking Spanish in public seems pretty racist to me. They aren’t going after criminals they’re going after anyone who is brown and speaks Spanish. If they just want to deport the criminals then why are they trying to enter churches and elementary schools??

Trump now wants to start something up in Guantanamo Bay that is more or less a concentration camp. If it’s all about just getting these people out and having them come the “legal way” then why hold them in a camp on in a dangerous place. Also if they’re “pro immigration” as long as it’s legal why is this administration trying to make that process harder??

I’ve never heard a good argument against immigration that isn’t rooted from racism and stereotypes. These people add billions to our social security every year, they pick our vegetables, build our houses, create new jobs and contribute greatly to our economy. Anyone who knows this knows our country won’t be better by getting rid of them, but they’ll just repeat the “they’re all criminals!” And “they’re raping our women!” Until they’re blue in the face with no facts to back it up. Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, how does immigrants being here affect our lives negatively at all?? MAGA just wants them to believe that instead of focusing on the real enemy which is greedy corporations and billionaires.

So, I think it makes sense that generally software is eventually released to the public domain if it isn't actually being used.

1f0qs72,CMV: Islam should not be tolerated unless it's more progressive ,"Hi,

I'm a gay guy in my 20s and consider myself open minded and left-leaning. I believe that we all should be treated with respect and dignity. There is an internal conflict in me. I see many progressive people complaining about islamophobia and I just find it contradictory and hypocritical. Most Muslims interpret Islam in a very traditional way, it seems more strict to me than most Christians (I am also against other religions that suppress human rights and freedoms). But for some reason many people think that it's cool to defend Islam. Almost all Muslims discussing i have seen on the internet and in real time say that homosexuality is a sin and are very intolerant of it. 

I would be ok with people practicing Islam if they did not judge other people for living their life as they want.

17q0cl6,CMV: There is no compelling reason to be angry about diversity in media,"Do you ever see those articles or videos of people complaining about ""wokeness"" in media, but they never quite describe what that is? Based on the context, it sounds like they're just complaining about diversity. I think more diversity is a good thing, because the world is diverse. That's just reality.  
  
I love the show Friends, but I'm going to pick on it a bit just as an example. It takes place in New York, and all the main characters are straight white people. Almost all the supporting characters are white people. It isn't very realistic in its portrayal of New York, because the city in reality is not 99% white people.  
  
My point is-- having more diversity makes sense and is more of a good thing than a bad thing. It's a net positive.  
  
Now let's look at some of the arguments these people make:  
  
**""Executives are forcing diversity just to pander.""**  
  
Probably. But executives have always pandered. Their job is to appeal to people in order to maximize profit. Why zero in on diversity as the main cause of this? It's a broader issue of studios chasing the dollar. At least in this case, the result of having more diversity isn't really a bad thing.  
  
**""They sacrifice good writing for diversity.""**  
  
Once again, these are two separate things. I agree that telling a good story should be the focus. Why would diversity have anything to do with this? Why pick out diversity as the thing that is making movies forget to tell a good story? There have always been poorly written movies long before diversity was encouraged.  
  
**""They make unnecessary changes to things we love.""**  
  
Anytime something is brought back for a reboot or new adaptation, there are going to be changes. Not all of these changes will be strictly ""necessary"". As long as you don't have an attitude of being resistant to all change, I don't see why changing something just to be more diverse is a bad thing. Why not instead just blame the changes that actually harm the story and characters? A minor change like a character having a different skin color does not sound harmful to me. It sounds like a very minor change.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
To bring it all together, let's suppose they rebooted Friends with entirely new actors playing the same characters. And none of the acting was good. And they changed the race of one of the the main characters. And the writing was terrible. What would you think of all this? What would you mention in a critical review of it?  
  
I would think rebooting it in the first place is a completely unnecessary cash grab. I would be irritated by how bad the writing is. And I would point out how the new portrayals are not nearly as good as the original cast. So I'd have a lot of criticisms of the reboot, but none of this has anything to do with diversity or being ""woke"". If they decided to make Rachel black, I wouldn't care that the character was black. I would care that the new actor doesn't do as good of a job as Jennifer Aniston.

black i wouldn t care that the character was black i would care that the new actor doesn t do as good of a job as jennifer aniston am i missing something where does this anger towards diversity come

1h7f34c,CMV: Anyone who bough Hawk Tuah Crypto with anything other than fun money is a fucking idiot,"I actually don't have anything against Haley Welch. Let me be clear. I am (or at least was) of the opinion that she is a very smart woman who is able to capitalize on her 15 minutes of fame and might be a respected podcaster or something else. And if you say that's impossible, just listen to Joe Rogan's ""I'm Gonna Be Dead Someday"" CD and ask yourself if you think that had the makings of a millionaire podcaster who would sway the election of the United States and the world-changing consequences of Trump's election.

That said, Crypto is what it is. It might be a store of value. It might be the future of money transactions, replacing credit cards and cash. Or it might be a ticket to sell your crypto to a bigger fool than you. We're still figuring that out. If you thought a memecoin about a drunk girl giving blowjob instructions was going to be the next Bitcoin, or even the next Doge, that's on you.

1d8308p,CMV: Castle doctrine is a good idea. Stand your ground is not.,"With castle doctrine, the point is that you have a right to defend yourself in your home. It essentially says, well, in the home, we don’t know if you’re lying or telling the truth about an intruder being a threat, so we will give you the benefit of the doubt because it’s your property. Also, this includes the fact that you’re unlikely to be able to retreat safely in your home, so you may be even more justified in using lethal force. 

Stand your ground is essentially castle doctrine but just apply it everywhere. But it is that application of it everywhere that is the exact issue in my book. First off, in public, you don’t have anymore right to be there than the person you believe is attacking you, so you should not be able to be the one who decides if your life is in danger or not. Additionally, it is generally much easier to retreat in public than in your home. 

Another thing is that stand your ground can be easily abused. Someone can just shoot someone and tell the police that the person they shot did x or y. 

Now, if someone does retreat and then has no choice, or is unable to retreat, then yes, deadly force is fine but this is true in all 50 states and doesn’t need a stand your ground law.

It makes sense that you can defend your castle without needing to retreat, but the entire world was never your castle.

179e0bf,"CMV: Israel over decades has shown its willingness give back land for peace. In turn, there cannot be peace until Palestinians accept that Israel isn't going anywhere and are willing to make compromises.","The Palestinians have been offered statehood multiple times and have rejected it everytime because the deal wasn't 100% to their liking. In 1948, they said no. In 1967 Israel offered all of the land it won in war back in exchange for peace, the answer from Arab countries was a resounding ""NO."" Then you have Arafat leading everyone on and then rejecting a reasonable peace offer from Israel.

Eventually you have to wonder if statehood is the goal or something else.

At a certain point, Palestinians will have to recognize that Israel isn't going anywhere and if their ultimate objective is statehood, there has to be some compromise. Israel gave back the entirety of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for peace, a wildly controversial and unpopular move at the time. 

When Israel left Gaza in 2005, it forcibly removed Israeli citizens to let Gazans govern themselves.

 When the goal is great (peace, or statehood), hard and tough decisions must be made. Compromise must be made. After WW2, the Germans lost parts of historic Germany. Like it or not, for peace to exist, when one party starts a war and then loses, they lose leverage and negotiating power and must make compromises if peace is truly the goal. It's been that way throughout history.

Palestinians need to let go of the notion that resistance means the eradication of Israel and that generations of refugees can return. It's simply a fairytale dream at this point. Too many Palestinians, in my opinion, have been brainwashed to believe that this is a feasible outcome -- hence the celebration/support for any and all type of resistance, no matter how gruesome and inhumane.

Meanwhile, in the current conflict, I've yet to see a reasonable answer as to what Israel should do instead of attacking Hamas? What other country would allow another entity to break through, murder over 1000 civillians, and then take back over 150 hostages? If the line hasn't been crossed now, then how many more massacres will be needed before people realize that Hamas' stated goal is to destroy Israel?

What is a proportional response to an entity like Hamas who's objective is to eliminate Israel entirely? Am geniunely curious if there is an alternative to war because I sure hope there is.

1fwyycs,"CMV: Trump and MAGA Didn't Drain the Swamp, they Became the Swamp","In 2016, the rally cry of MAGA was ""DRAIN THE SWAMP."" It was unapologetically anti-establishment and supported by frustrated people from all types of political slants. Whatever your thoughts about it overall, under that banner he won office.

Fast forward to 2020 and 2024, and the ""DRAIN THE SWAMP"" banner has been taken down (and probably burned out back) in favor of quotes from Trump like:

>“I’m for electric cars, I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly” at a rally in Atlanta, GA.

>""You’ve been waiting on a permit for five years; you’ll get it on Day 1"" Trump was quoted when speaking to oil execs in exchange for hefty donations.

These are just a few, flagrant ""quid pro quo"" style corruption scenarios which Trump seems **proud of**. Trump's pledges to take a ""hands on"" approach to interfering with interest rates sound like an antithesis of the 2016 MAGA mission statement. Trump's pledges to impose tariffs on all imports sound like an antithesis of the original 2016 MAGA mission statement. Trump's intention to bring Elon Musk, a silicon valley billionaire and enormous lobbying and dark money proponent, into his administration sound like an antithesis of the original 2016 MAGA movement.

My view is that the original MAGA movement died nearly as it began. It got Trump elected, and proved to be ""too hard"" to actually pursue beyond that. Trump and Co. realized it would be much easier to move into the swamp than try and drain it. Instead of taking down Wall Street ponzi brokers, he himself now sells ""crypto-coins"" that are worthless to working people.

1b5p0bh,"CMV: All video games should have an easy mode, and those who use it shouldn’t be embarrassed to do so.","Don’t get me wrong, I love a hard game. I am a big fan of games like Hollow knight and have been trying for quite a while to beat Baldur’s Gate in Honour Mode. But…

I think all games should have an easy mode/setting and you’re a bit of a dickhead if you make fun of people who do use easy mode. 
Video Games should be available to everyone, when the mechanics of a game are too hard for someone they should have the option to make it easier so they can at enjoy the other aspects of a game like the art and storyline.
On the flip side I also think there should be an option for a “Hero Mode/Hard Mode” for the people who want an even harder experience, and would still allow for that badge of honour for beating the game still an option.
 
I’ve heard from people about how they didn’t play Dark Souls or Eldin Ring (aka any “souls like games”) because of the game difficulty and that just seems like such a shame to me that so many people miss out on the rest of the game because they can’t enjoy the combat. Not only is that a loss for the player but for the people who worked on those aspects of the game.
May it be the casual gamer, a beginner, a child, people with disabilities…etc. they should have just as much of a chance to enjoy a game as the seasoned gamer.

I don’t really think I need to explain why I’d call someone a dickhead for making fun of people who do use easy mode, but I’ll say it anyways. Lots of people don’t have the time, abilities or want to be good at video games and that doesn’t make them any less than anyone who is good at games. Different people, different hobbies. Don’t discourage people from enjoying the art form of video games just because you have mastered the combat and think you’re better because of that. Yeah yeah, I get it you’re the master at Sekiro but at least John who plays Stardew is actually fun to talk to. 

So in conclusion, I think every game should have an easy mode. It would be decently simple to change without having to uproot the entire gameplay by changing player and enemy HP, starting weapons/armour, more save points… etc. 
I don’t think we should be making games easier in general, it should still be a source of pride for people who finally get past the challenges of games but that shouldn’t be reason to not have a mode for those who still want to enjoy the rest of the game.

countries that may be even better are probably in the single digits, or low double digits: norway and switzerland probably, then maybe denmark and finland. much more difficult to determine are countries such as germany which is probably about the same, sweden which is in my opinion slightly worse than the US, maybe taiwan, australia.

the fact is, the US is very rich. it has ridiculous amount of disposable income, and while it is economically unequal, still most people have more purchasing power than in other developed countries. it is very good for doing business, inversting, it is very good compared to the world in LGBT laws and people's opinion on LGBT issues. it is one of the least racists countries in the world, if you travelled a lot you would know about it.

in my 18-20s I was very anti-USA, then I educated myself and put it in the top 10 best countries to live in. which is specially commendable giving its very large land area and population to manage. the single worst issue compared to other developed countries is security: homicides and its GPI is very much worse than other comparable countries. then in democracy, GINI, health it could be better. but in median income, GDP PPP, GDP PPP per capita, poverty rates, unemployment rates, HDI,  business, competitive, innovation indexes, economic freedom, etc. is a beast.

1k43r3m,CMV: Citizens United was the worst thing to happen to the American political landscape,"Ever since the Citizens United v. FEC decision in 2010, I’ve felt like the integrity of American democracy has been steadily deteriorating. The ruling essentially said that corporations and other outside entities can spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections, under the banner of free speech. To me, that decision opened the floodgates to unchecked political spending, dark money, and disproportionate influence by the ultra-wealthy and powerful interest groups.

I believe this has led to:

	•	Unaccountable Super PACs spending billions with little transparency.

	•	Candidates beholden to donors, not voters, because campaigns are now insanely expensive when they likely wouldn’t be if Super PACs weren’t in bidding wars for ad time. Don’t even get me started on how some people in office can’t be bothered to attend a town hall with constituents. 

	•	Distorted public discourse, where those with the biggest megaphones (and more money than any reasonable coalition of voters could amass) shape the narrative.

	•	Widening political cynicism — many people feel like their vote or voice doesn’t matter when billionaires and corporations can outspend entire communities.

I’d love to hear opposing views, especially if you think the decision was the right one or has had unintended positive consequences.

1k1od4a,CMV: Voting Republican today is a fundamentally inhumane act.,"Over the past several years, I've come to believe that the modern Republican party—and by extension, many who support it—actively vote against the wellbeing of vulnerable people. From policies on healthcare and education to the way marginalized communities are treated, I see a pattern of cruelty, apathy, and an unwillingness to engage with the broader impact of their votes.

This has led me to a cynical conclusion: Republican voters either don't care about others, lack the critical thinking to see the harm being done, or are simply echoing the beliefs of their social circles without deeper examination. I’ve struggled to see meaningful counterexamples, and I worry that “conservatism” today is less a philosophy and more a brand that people follow blindly.

I know this is a harsh stance—and I’m open to being challenged on it. If I’m wrong, I want to understand how. Are there values in today’s Republican voting base that prioritize humanity? Can voting Republican in today’s political climate still be morally defensible?

1jc31bt,CMV: The democratic base is not progressive.,"There is alot of talk right now about how the democrats are ignoring their base and not taking the fight to trump. Like most progressives want. However this assumes that the democrats base are progressives and actually want that.

The key points in this argument are, The outcomes of the 2016 and 2020 primarys, and the current representation of democrats in congress.

In 2016 bernie sanders got 43% of delegates, in 2020 progressives candidates (bernie and Warren) won 34% dropping their support by a quarter. 

In congress, 95 out of the 213 democrats in the house are members of the progressive caucas. 44% of the total. In the senate one out of 47 democrats are progressives. 2% of the total. Combining both house and senate. Combining them 36% of democrats in congress are self declared progressives.

This is a clear minority of the party. The majority of the party are not progressives. This representation reflects the primary votes from the last election season.

1mpjmow,"CMV: The ""recycling is a scam"" narrative is a harmful faux-progressive American myth","There is a very popular narrative in the US nowadays that ""recycling is a scam/myth/fake"", which is promoted by citing that plastic recycling is uneconomical and that companies are actually to blame for waste rather than consumers. This is all only partly-true and lacking important context.    
  
The most obvious problem with this narrative is it usually conflates plastic recycling with recycling as a whole. Even if plastic recycling were entirely not worth doing, recycling of cardboard/paper, glass, and metal are all much more efficient and sustainable. Some of you might argue that most people don't actually conflate the two and are just talking about plastic recycling specifically, but if necessary I can cite many, MANY, hit tweets where people conflate the two. I would go as far as to say that most people who reference this topic make no distinction.

Next, the notion that recycling is not worth doing because most ends up in landfill anyway also has a number of problems with it. One is that it assumes the majority of recycled waste needs to be effectively recycled in order to make the practice of recycling worth doing at all, but the bigger problem is that it's not universally true and instead reflects an Americentric frame of reference that is used to make a broad statement about recycling as a whole without making any effort to discern *why* the \[American\] recycling sorting process is so inefficient. Most other developed countries actually have significantly higher recycling rates than the US. Most other developed countries have multiple different recycling bins for different types of recyclable waste, but this is too much for Americans so they mostly just use single-stream recycling where all the different types are mixed together then sorted later at the recycling plant. This is obviously much less efficient, but what makes it so much worse is that even with the most simplified system possible the average American still can't be bother to put any effort into sorting their waste. Almost any time I see a public trash and recycling bins next to each other I will look inside to see almost no distinction between their contents. The janitor at a school my friend used to work at would just throw all the school's recycling in the dumpster for no reason other than that he was too lazy to keep them separate. Americans who move to foreign countries like Japan often experience culture shock over how much more complicated their personal waste sorting is and how much personal responsibility they are expected to take for it. The uncomfortable truth is this: American recycling being inefficient is not primarily a systemic problem, but a cultural problem tied to American hyper-individualism. When people promote the ""recycling is a scam"" narrative they just make the problem worse by giving people justification to reinforce negligent practices.

Inb4 I know some of you are going to bring up that consumer product companies have promoted recycling in an attempt to shift blame for waste onto consumers, but that does nothing to refute the viability of recycling as a practice.

1eem5bf,CMV: Voting should be mandatory and America should adopt the Australian voting model,"My view is thus, America should duplicate the Australian model for voting, which includes the following points.

- Election Day should be a federal holiday or moved to a Saturday.

- Failing to cast a ballot, even a blank ballot should result in a fine. This fine can be gotten out of with demonstrating a good reason you could not vote.

- Employers should be required to give anyone working on Election Day a reasonable amount of time off to vote. 

- Optional, but a part of the system that we should copy, even if not mandated by regulation or law. Fundraisers selling sausages at polling places, colloquial called “democracy sausages” a beloved part of the Australian voting culture.

It seems almost criminal to me that it’s not the norm for everyone in the world’s “bastion of democracy” to vote, and that it’s considered a point of concern to query and possibly fine everyone who didn’t cast a ballot.

My central view is that voting should be mandatory, the exact method by which we do this is not important to me, I was merely offering the Australian model as an option. I welcome being convinced why mandatory voting is a bad thing.

1hfn4kf,Cmv: Trying to be manly is ironically very unmanly,"This is a specific type of person. Guys who try desperately to be manly “alpha” men, who are very insecure about how others see them and become very emotional if anyone dares think they are not mr macho man are ironically very unmanly. They cannot do something which they consider “feminine” because they are manly men what if someone sees them. They are slaves to gender stereotypes and society. They have to try to look as “manly” as possible and anyone who does not look like that is automatically less of a man to them. What is manly is obviously not always universally defined, but going off gender stereotypes, i feel that caring so hard about being manly is not very manly. It is also the same kind of guy who is always becoming so angry at everything and yet says that men are not emotional as if anger is not an emotion. 

I feel as if being brave enough to truly be your authentic self in the world without trying to be manly and just being who you are is what is actually manly. You do whatever you want it does not matter if someone else might think it is not masculine, who cares. That being said if you happen to fit into the masculine stereotype then that is cool and completely fine. As long as you are not a try hard or asshole about it.

1d00efr,CMV: The 24-hour time format is far superior to the 12-hour time format.,"Using the 24-hour time format eliminates the use of the suffixes AM and PM as well as any ambiguity about if a time is in the morning or evening. I can say, “We’re leaving at 1830” and there is no question if it is in the morning or afternoon.

The 24-hour format is also the primarily used format internationally, which helps to avoid confusion, especially when across multiple time zones.

I see no major downsides to the use of it and the standardization worldwide would be extremely beneficial. The learning process that many would undergo is negligible considering the benefits and it would take a few weeks maximum for people to learn how to use it on average.

1j7926t,CMV: MAGA only cares about veterans when it’s campaign season,"The same maga peeps who chant “support the troops” at rallies don’t seem to care much once those troops come home. 80,000 VA jobs are on the chopping block, and somehow the “most pro-military president ever” thinks gutting healthcare and services is a good way to honor veterans.

Veteran homelessness? Still a crisis. Veteran suicides? Still happening at ~17 per day. The VA budget? Shrinking… unless you count the part that gets funneled to private contractors. Meanwhile, defense spending stays sky-high because supporting the military only counts when there’s a war to fight.

Trump called fallen soldiers suckers and losers, but the people who claim to love veterans just shrugged. Which really confuses me but…When military leadership wouldn’t bend the knee, he purged them. When John McCain, a POW, criticized him, he mocked his capture. This isn’t new. The GOP loves to perform patriotism, until veterans need something that doesn’t fit on a bumper sticker.

When the cameras are rolling, they wrap themselves in the flag. When the cameras are off, they cut benefits work to privatize care, and let veterans and veteran workers fired, fend for themselves.

1ajmref,CMV: Jay-Z made a fool of himself at the Grammy Awards,"The Grammy Awards aired last night and of all the great moments, Jay-Z gave a speech where he implied disrespect to his wife and hip-hop.

The unspoken part is maybe a bit of bias and racism? Also a little bit of targeting at the sensation known as Taylor Swift?

A little bit of verbal activism and righteousness without much a bite in my opinion.

Beyonce has won 32 Grammy Awards. She is the all-time winner in the history of music. In terms of the Grammy Awards and subjectiness of art... She is considered the all-time best.

Several black artists have won the top prize over the years, including pure hip-hop like OutKast.

In terms of hip-hop being disrespected, didn't they dedicate last year's show to the history of hip-hop? I believe that Questlove produced it, and 20+ acts performed.

The telecast is the telecast, but the Grammys is genre based. They still have to give awards to the best Americana and Polka albums at some point, too. It can't all be a tribute to Beyonce.

You still need time to acknowledge what artists like Billie Elish are doing as well. Pure pop music was absolutely gigantic this year.

1f8yzr0,Cmv: Bruce wayne would improve Gotham much more by investing his billions in society rather than by becoming batman,"According to Forbes, our hero has a wealth of nearly 10 billion in a city that is blatantly a dystopia where there is a huge class difference.

Now, stop robberies is a heroic thing to do but the high rate of criminality in gotham is due to the extreme poverty and social difference.
The Joker can be see as a proof that super-criminals of Gotham did not pop up from another planet of pire evilness but arise also because of the sick society they live in.

My view is that the crime in gotham would be less if the billionaire invested in schools and social works or used his money to make a political rise instead of buying some million-dollar suits to beat up a single mugger.

It be summarized as follows:

1. Batman tends not to save the world (like superman) but his city (like spider man)

2. Gotham is a socio-economical nightmare and this has caused its high criminal rate (super criminal aside), anyway despite the super criminal the majority of suffering in common people of the city is caused by poverty and instability 

3. Batman would have the power to change the whole city by his economic means but instead of curing the causes of evil (the dystopian society) he tries to solve only the effects it produces (crime).

In conclusion, yes maybe you would have still Super villains but common thieves and murderers would decrease much more by improving the city wuth money than by punching some of them in the streets dressed up as a bat.

1mlzke2,cmv: The electoral college makes voters feel unheard and should be abolished,"Voters in States that consistently vote the other way have ZERO say in who our POTUS will be, which is profundly undemocratic. I don't have exact numbers, but 36 states are considered deep blue/red.

Dems in Texas and Republicans in Illinois may as well not go voting. Is that really the way the US should work? The electoral college was invented to compromise with wary states from joining the US. This purpose has now been served and we can get rid of it, as it majorly disrupts the democratic flow of the country and we don't have to appease slave owning elites anymore.

Regardless of where you stand politically, this should concern every US citizen.

You're now forcing other people to listen to whatever music you want. In my experience, it's too loud for me to enjoy what I'm listening to because it's competing with both you and the noise of traffic.

If everyone did what you're doing, there would be a cacophony of noise that no one could enjoy. If you're doing something for your own benefit, but can only do it because no one else is doing it, isn't that being self-centered?

192eqb6,"CMV: It is now in men's best interests to stop using dating apps, disconnect from them entirely, and force society to find a new way for people to meet and date.","39M here, FWIW. The culture of dating apps has established itself in such a way that men have arisen as the unequivocal losers in this game, basically like playing a football game where you start being down by multiple scores and it's already the final quarter of the game. 

We all know the statistics: men get about [1 or 2 matches a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/11btxok/men_how_many_matches_do_you_get_a_day/?rdt=52564), across all dating apps. That's going to be roughly equal to the number of LIKES they get since most men are liking the vast majority of profiles they see, a strategy they are probably justified in using since there's no point in being selective with so little working in one's favor. Women, on the other hand, get [hundreds of likes a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/163amr9/how_many_matches_for_women/?rdt=42121), all of which can translate into a match if they so choose. If I conservatively pick the number as 200 matches a month, that means women are having ONE HUNDRED TIMES THE SUCCESS THAT MEN ARE HAVING. One. Hundred.

That's clearly a losing game for men. So why should we continue to participate? Clearly it is in the best interests of men to collectively agree to stop using dating apps, to delete each and every one of them from our phones and, I dunno, at the very least force us to meet people the old-fashioned way, by meeting people at bars, getting set up with a friend of a friend, asking out your cute coworker, etc. These options are all on the table right now, obviously, but a lot of women aren't even leaving themselves open to the opportunity because they know they've got their ace-in-the-hole on a dating app somewhere. So why risk things with your coworker or do the socially awkward thing of approaching that dude at the bar when you can just rely on these dating apps to do the guesswork for you on whether the dude is even available and if he's interested in you?

It's a losing game for men and we men should collectively agree to stop using dating apps completely. Keep in mind that my viewpoint is not so concerned with how FEASIBLE it is to suddenly get all men to stop using dating apps; it's more about what I think would happen if we could snap our fingers and make it happen. But also, I don't consider it to be completely NON-feasible, since generally it is easier to not do something than it is to do something, right? If I can do my part to do my fellow men a favor, of course I will do that, and I think this move right here is in our best interests.

to do the guesswork for you on whether the dude is even available and if he s interested in you it s a losing game for men and we men should collectively agree to stop using dating apps completely keep in mind that my viewpoint is not so concerned with how feasible it is to suddenly get all men to stop using dating apps it s more about what i think would happen if we could snap our fingers and make it happen but also i don t consider it to be completely non feasible since generally it is easier to not do something than it is to do something right if i can do my part to do my fellow men a favor of course i will do that and i think this move right here is in our best interests cmv,1,cmv it is now in men s best interests to stop using dating apps disconnect from them entirely and force society to find a new way for people to meet and date 39m here fwiw the culture of dating apps has established itself in such a way that men have arisen as the unequivocal losers in this game basically like playing a football game where you start being down by multiple scores and it s already the final quarter of the game we all know the statistics men get about 1 or 2 matches a month across all dating apps that s going to be roughly equal to the number of likes they get since most men are liking the vast majority of profiles they see a strategy they are probably justified in using since there s no point in being selective with so little working in one s favor women on the other hand get hundreds of likes a month all of which can translate into a match if they so choose if i conservatively pick the number as 200 matches a month that means women are having one hundred times the success that men are having one hundred that s clearly a losing game for men so why should we continue to participate clearly it is in the best interests of men to collectively agree to stop using dating apps to delete each and every one of them from our phones and i dunno at the very least force us to meet people the old fashioned way by meeting people at bars getting set up with a friend of a friend asking out your cute coworker etc these options are all on the table right now

1lfbd1x,CMV: Israel settlers are terrorists and by extension Israel engages in State Sponsored Terrorism.,"A Terrorist is defined as: a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

The Settlements and the Settler movement are considered illegal under International Law. There is a well-documented mountain of evidence of Settlers using violence and intimidation (including but not limited to murder, rape and sexual violence, destruction of property, etc) against the Civilians of the West Bank and East Jerusalem with the goal of expelling the Palestinian natives and settling their lands as they believe the land was promised to them. Even the US Department of State has defied Settler Violence as Terrorism.

I define State Sponsored Terrorism as Terrorist violence that is carried out with the active support of national governments provided to violent non-state actors.

The Israeli government has been actively supporting Israeli settlements giving funding and giving subsidies to the settlers, arming the settlers, and even creating government sponsored programs to expand the illegal settlements.

1axovtd,CMV: For American Jews there is a de facto loyalty test to Israel to participate in vast majority Jewish spaces,"I'm an American Jew who was raised in the reform tradition. Been more and less connected to the broader Jewish community at various points in my life. As a grow older with a son of my own I would love to be more connected to the Jewish community, but I'm really turned off by the intense social pressure to uncritically support Israel. 

I don't agree with Israeli government policies both around Palestinians and the fact that Netanyahu is extremely right wing on many other issues as well. As a public school teacher my school is facing budget cuts because the government has ""no money"" but is sending Israel millions and millions of dollars every day. 

Besides that I'm an American citizen, I fail to see why my Jewishness should be contingent on my loyalty to a foreign country.  

When I go to mainstream Jewish spaces I feel intense social pressure to keep my mouth shut. If I were honest about my views I feel I would be ostracized. Mainstream Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation League have called Jews who dare to criticize Israel as ""self-hating""

I try to imagine this situation in any other ethnic group. Just imagining Chinese-Americans being called ""self-hating"" for not supporting the CCP. That would be insane. So why does it happen to Jews?

It was Hitler's viewpoint that Jews were secretly loyal to a foreign government. It's wild to me that mainstream American Jewish organizations have come around to essentially the same view - American Jews must support Israel or they are ""bad Jews.""

Anyway, I'm sad about what is going on Gaza - but also sad because I want to raise my child within the Jewish community and feel very disconnected right now. 

What would change my view: examples of large, mainstream Jewish organizations or communities which accept Jews who criticize Israel

What would not change my view: you should support Israel, you are a bad Jew. That would just prove me right.

1ej4z31,CMV: Men and women can have friendships that are purely platonic.,"(I'm not sure if NSFW is really needed here, but I do think this is sort of an adult issue).

Ok, this debate has been had online over and over, and I just saw another instance of it today. It blows my mind that people seem to think men and women cannot have platonic relationships. I personally am friends with multiple women in a purely platonic way. Several of them have gotten married in the last few years, and I've attended at least three of their weddings on my own, and a couple more with my wife. My wife did not know any of these women before dating me, and she has expressed zero concern over me maintaining these friendships. 

I'm not a kid - I understand that men and women usually aren't close enough to be called ""friends"" unless there's some level of attraction going on, and it can be anxiety-inducing for women especially, if their man hangs out one on one with other women. I'll say this to clarify: I avoid putting myself in situations where I'm by myself with another woman other than my wife, as I think there's something to be said about being respectful, both of my wife and of other women. I wouldn't want to put someone in a situation where there's an implicit suggestiveness, even if I know I would never act on anything.

So basically what I'm saying is: I think platonic relationships are good and healthy, but those platonic relationships should come with boundaries. One of those boundaries is a self-imposed rule to not hangout with a woman one on one in an environment that isn't public. I'm fine with the idea of grabbing breakfast with a woman other than my wife, as long as my wife is fine with it. Any hint of not being fine with that, even if not stated explicitly, and I absolutely would respect that. I think there's stricter rules you can impose when your wife is pregnant or was just recently pregnant, as that's obviously a vulnerable period of time when we know that men sometimes cheat.

The other aspect that I'll mention about this topic is that I believe it doesn't matter whether you're a man or a woman - most people choose all of their friends, regardless of sex, based on some level of admiration. So when people say men can't have platonic friendships with women, I think what they really mean is that there isn't zero attraction involved. And I think that's probably true if you think deeply about peoples' feelings. But I also think that's not really any different than how I choose my guy friends. I like hanging out with dudes who are talented, skilled, smart, kind, have clout, etc. I don't like being friends with guys who aren't bringing something to the table. But I'm as straight as can be and never had any sexual interest with my guy friends. For my women friends, the traits that lead to platonic friendship definitely overlap the traits that I see in my wife, but that doesn't mean my wife is replaceable by platonic friends. That's a totally different thing.

I wouldn't have married my wife if that weren't the case. Replacing your wife by another woman only makes sense if you see women as physical objects rather than as people, which is terrible in and of itself. I don't view my wife that way.

Also, I will say that I think it's good that if people think men can't have platonic friendships with women, they aren't friends with women. Different people have different boundaries and levels of self control. Some people are by nature very sexual, and it might be harder to control themselves in the presence of attractive women who aren't their SO. So anyone who recognizes that in themselves, great. I just think it definitely IS possible to have platonic relationships with the opposite sex (if you're straight), and I have a lot of evidence in my life proving that.",GenerativeAdversary,428,0.7799999713897705,263,1722696188,2024-08-03

1azmbbp,CMV: Dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women’s refusal to concede this one point is annoying,"
I’m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode. Of course they don’t and I would say on a macro level, men are more privileged than woman. However I think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates, find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three.

So I will start by pointing out when you’re talking about struggling with dating, for women it’s struggling to find mister right. Even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it’s just not from the men they want. When they go on dating apps, it’s more of that with a twist. They see “Mr. Right” who’s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there’s no guarantee if she’ll match, but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe through a bunch of perfectly normal guys who just aren’t the hottest man on the app.

For men, it’s a desert. No attention, no likes, no anything unless you are exceptionally good looking. The funny thing is, for anything else that is a social gathering this same logic applies just at a smaller pool. Bars, clubs, parties, etc. if you are not one of the more physically attractive men, it’s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman.

Men are also the ones risking rejection. Many women like to say they face rejection too, but it’s not really much compared to what the average man does. In my experiences in trying to get a number, just a number, it took 40 no’s before 1 yes. You could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it.

When it comes to sex, I’m not even going to get too into the weeds. A 5/10 woman can hookup with a 7/10 guy any times she wants. A 5/10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5/10 woman. Women sleep up but date across, men sleep down but date across.

Lastly I want to talk about the main rebuttal I hear, “it’s dangerous to date as a woman, they could be raped or killed” and while I understand women’s fears here and they are valid, that’s not a dating issue. It’s a woman issue.

A woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she’s going on a first date with. That fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating.

A parallel would be like me saying “well it’s harder to date for men because I’m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape. So it’s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky.”

Either both of these statements are true, or they’re not since they’re not a result of dating.",GorrilaRuffy,308,0.5699999928474426,1619,1708862489,2024-02-25

you are not one of the more physically attractive men it s not going to happen anywhere as easily as it would for the average woman men are also the ones risking rejection many women like to say they face rejection too but it s not really much compared to what the average man does in my experiences in trying to get a number just a number it took 40 no s before 1 yes you could not sit here and tell me that the average woman would have that same record or even close to it when it comes to sex i m not even going to get too into the weeds a 5 10 woman can hookup with a 7 10 guy any times she wants a 5 10 guy is going to have to fight to hook up with another 5 10 woman women sleep up but date across men sleep down but date across lastly i want to talk about the main rebuttal i hear it s dangerous to date as a woman they could be raped or killed and while i understand women s fears here and they are valid that s not a dating issue it s a woman issue a woman is more likely to be raped by a friend or by a family member than someone she s going on a first date with that fear women have is more about existence as a woman than it is about dating a parallel would be like me saying well it s harder to date for men because i m more likely to be a victim of any violent crime ranging from assault to murder with the only exception being rape so it s harder for me to date because stepping outside is more risky either both of these statements are true or they re not since they re not a result of dating,1,cmv dating is objectively harder for men than it is women and women s refusal to concede this one point is annoying i m not one of those guys that thinks women live life on easy mode of course they don t and i would say on a macro level men are more privileged than woman however i think one of the few things women have over men is the ability to get dates find a relationship and have sex and any combination of the three so i will start by pointing out when you re talking about struggling with dating for women it s struggling to find mister right even the average looking woman gets male attention and typically it s just not from the men they want when they go on dating apps it s more of that with a twist they see mr right who s typically the hottest looking guy on the app and there s no guarantee if she ll match but there is a guarantee that she will have to swipe

1iy3g36,"CMV: Russia should be held accountable for invading Ukraine, and they shouldn’t be allowed to veto their own punishment","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a clear violation of international law and sovereignty. The fact that Russia, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, can veto any resolution aimed at holding them accountable is deeply troubling. It’s like allowing a criminal to veto their own punishment—how can we expect justice when the perpetrator has that kind of power?

The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Russia’s actions (93 to 18), but the Security Council’s structure gives Russia the ability to block any real consequences. This is not just a flaw in the system; it’s a serious issue that allows a nation to act out wildly, without facing the repercussions of their aggression.

If Russia is allowed to continue this unchecked, it sets a dangerous precedent where powerful countries can invade others and avoid consequences simply because they have the power to block action. That’s not how international law should work. If we believe in sovereignty and accountability, we need to reform the U.N. and prevent Russia from using its veto to avoid facing the consequences of its actions.

How to change my view: 
If presented with evidence that Russia was not in the wrong in invading Ukraine, and that somehow it was Ukraine’s fault, I would be open to reconsidering my position. Also, if you can explain to me how having five permanent powers in the U.N. is more fair, especially when those countries are acting in bad faith, and how it’s justifiable for them to have a veto on being held accountable for their actions, that would also help change my perspective.",PoolShotTom,1238,0.9399999976158142,222,1740511643,2025-02-25 13:27:23,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1iy3g36/cmv_russia_should_be_held_accountable_for/,2,2025,0.11574226014659228,0.053035757139428846,0.08438900864301056,cmv russia should be held accountable for invading ukraine and they shouldn t be allowed to veto their own punishment,russia s invasion of ukraine is a clear violation of international law and sovereignty the fact that russia as a permanent member of the u n security council can veto any resolution aimed at holding them accountable is deeply troubling it s like allowing a criminal to veto their own punishment how can we expect justice when the perpetrator has that kind of power the u n general assembly overwhelmingly condemned russia s actions 93 to 18 but the security council s structure gives russia the ability to block any real consequences this is not just a flaw in the system it s a serious issue that allows a nation to act out wildly without facing the repercussions of their aggression if russia is allowed to continue this unchecked it sets a dangerous precedent where powerful countries can invade others and avoid consequences simply because they have the power to block action that s not how international law should work if we believe in sovereignty and accountability we need to reform the u n and prevent russia from using its veto to avoid facing the consequences of its actions how to change my view if presented with evidence that russia was not in the wrong in invading ukraine and that somehow it was ukraine s fault i would be open to reconsidering my position also if you can explain to me how having five permanent powers in the u n is more fair especially when those countries are acting in bad faith and how it s justifiable for them to have a veto on being held accountable for their actions that would also help change my perspective,0,cmv russia should be held accountable for invading ukraine and they shouldn t be allowed to veto their own punishment russia s invasion of ukraine is a clear violation of international law and sovereignty the fact that russia as a permanent member of the u n security council can veto any resolution aimed at holding them accountable is deeply troubling it s like allowing a criminal to veto their own punishment how can we expect justice when the perpetrator has that kind of power the u n general assembly overwhelmingly condemned russia s actions 93 to 18 but the security council s structure gives russia the ability to block any real consequences this is not just a flaw in the system it s a serious issue that allows a nation to act out wildly without facing the repercussions of their aggression if russia is allowed to continue this unchecked it sets a dangerous precedent where powerful countries can invade others and avoid consequences simply because they have the power to block action that s not how international law should work if we believe in sovereignty and accountability we need to reform the u n and prevent russia from using its veto to avoid facing the consequences of its actions how to change my view if presented with evidence that russia was not in the wrong in invading ukraine and that somehow it was ukraine s fault i would be open to reconsidering my position also if you can explain to me how having five permanent powers in the u n is more fair especially when those countries are acting in bad faith and how it s justifiable for them to have a veto on being held accountable for their actions that would also help change my perspective
