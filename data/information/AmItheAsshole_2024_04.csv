1c45tr4,AITA for refusing to pay for my girlfriend's plane ticket after she decided to stay longer on her trip without me?,"Throwaway bc she knows my reddit. 

So, here's the deal. My (28M) girlfriend (27F) of two years and I planned a two-week vacation to Italy. I paid for the flights, hotels—everything, because I make more than she does, and I wanted it to be a stress-free trip for both of us. Everything was great until the last day when she tells me she wants to stay longer to ""find herself"" and think about our relationship without me. She didn't discuss this with me beforehand, and it completely blindsided me.  
  
I was hurt and told her that if she feels she needs time alone, then she should also be independent financially during this extension of her trip. I said I wouldn’t be paying for her new return ticket whenever she decides to come back. Now, she's upset, calling me unsupportive and selfish, and some of our friends are saying I'm being an a-hole because I left her stranded in a foreign country without financial help.

1cdza0l,"AITA for not letting my 6'6"" brother have the free first class upgrade the airline gave me on our 12 hour flight?","Hello AITA--

We are at the beginning of my dad's retirement family trip. He is paying for all of us to meet as a family in Hawaii for a week since he is retiring after working at the same company for 42 years. There are six of us but my brother and I live in the same part of the country. 

I guess it's relevant to say I am 5'1"" and my brother is 6'6"". I fly all the time for work and have quite a bit of status with the airline for which my dad bought our tickets. 

This is what happened way earlier today. We were all boarded and ready to go when a flight attendant came up to me and whispered that they had a first class passenger not show up and they needed the coach seat to accommodate a standby passenger. She said I had by far the most status of anyone on the plane so they were willing to move me to first class for free. I was like oh yeah--and I took it in a heartbeat. I told my brother I'd see him in 12 hours and let me know if he wanted any food or drink and I grabbed my stuff and moved. Needless to say I had a nice flight. 

When we landed and were waiting for our shuttle my brother was so pissy but wouldn't tell me what was going on. He didn't speak to me the whole shuttle ride. We had a nice hello with the rest of the family but after I got down from my shower my mom took me aside and said what I did ""was awful."" I asked her what she was talking about and she said that I should have given my brother the seat. I thought that would be the end of it but all 5 of my siblings and my parents are upset with me and the vacation is off to a very rough start. 

I was trying to play with my niece and nephew in the lobby waiting for lunch and my sister said ""no they only like to play with people who give a shit about their family--what were you thinking?"" I asked her if this was about the first class thing and she said ""what do you think its about?"" I said that he never asked me to switch with him, she said ""an asshole makes people beg, family members don't.""

I've been by myself since brunch and not having much fun. AITA?",Abbyissostupid,12189,0.9399999976158142,2072,1714172412,2024-04-26 18:00:12,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cdza0l/aita_for_not_letting_my_66_brother_have_the_free/,4,2024
1btivvv,AITA for telling my friend her kid has no manners??,"A few of my (26F) friends came over to our house for a get-together lunch. A few of them have kids and brought them.

One of my friends, Nora (28F) has a 4 year old son (Jack) that is notorious for being naughty. Jack doesn't get along with other kids and is a constant source of crying and screaming. Nora brought Jack over. He said he wanted to take a nap so I showed Nora the guest room and told her to make herself comfortable. Nora came back downstairs after a while and we hung out.

Now, around 40 minutes later Jack came back down and was smiling like crazy. He had my wife's  (Kate - 29F) wedding ring. Kate is a doctor and doesn't take her ring to work. She leaves it on our nightstand. Jack had clearly gone into our bedroom. 

I told Nora I'd like him to give the ring back. Nora said he'd just get bored with it now and that I needed to relax. A few minutes later I asked Jack to please give the ring back. This triggered something because he ran to the window and threw the ring out in our spacious backyard. 

I got really, really mad. Kate adores her ring, and I had it custom made with many little touches. I told Nora her godd##n son had no manners and she needed to do something about him, maybe take him to a doctor because this is not healthy kid behavior. She got very upset and left. Other guests started leaving too.

Kate and I spent the entire evening looking for it but we couldn't find it. I am a crying mess, Kate keeps saying it's nothing but I know how much she loves that ring. Despite all this every mom in our friend group is calling me an AH for taking it too hard on Jack and Nora. Was I an AH?

1cgd5fj,AITA for not getting upset or convince the bride after I was uninvited to my friend’s wedding?,"This happened over the weekend but there’s still so much tension. 

One of my good friends, Matthew (26M) is getting married next month to Jennifer (26F). I (25F) have known Matthew since high school. We’ve both connected when it came to video games, especially Minecraft. Matthew has had his fair share of girlfriends over the years but when he met Jennifer 3 years ago, he said that he knew she was the one and they are madly in love with each other and I am so happy for them both. 

Last year, Matthew popped the question to Jennifer and she said yes. Jennifer’s demeanor towards me drastically changed after the engagement. She was distant towards me, she wouldn’t look at me and she would hardly speak to me which was weird since Jennifer was always so sweet and nice towards me. 

I’d still talk to Matthew and meet with him and our group of friends, sometimes with Jennifer and she would still act cold and not speak to me much. I kept my distance from Jennifer. Three months ago, we all received a save the date invitation and their wedding is going to take place at Matthew’s cabin 2 hours away and they were going to keep it small due to the size of the cabin so we were only allowed to bring one guest. That was when Jennifer acted extremely harsh and hostile towards me and said “bet you don’t have a plus one since you are so into my man.” I was taken aback. I asked her what the fuck she was talking about and she smirked and said I knew and to not act stupid. I ignored her remark and told her my boyfriend was coming. She looked surprised and left. I of course told Matthew about what Jennifer said to me and he was not happy, so he made her apologize to me. 

Then, last weekend, I was invited by matthew’s sister to go dress shopping with her and Jennifer. I declined at first because I wanted to keep my distance from Jennifer but Matthew’s sister assured me that she will deal with Jennifer and that our other friends will be there with us. So we go dress shopping and I found a beautiful dress that I thought would be perfect and I took a picture to send to my boyfriend since he planned on matching (I.e with a bow tie) with me. I tried the dress on and it was a perfect fit so I guess I got lucky. Jennifer was angry, called me names such as a whore, a boyfriend stealing bitch, and that I was officially uninvited to the wedding. She caused such a commotion, the employee of the store asked us to leave. 

I told Jennifer I didn’t want to come to the wedding anyway but I was going to because MY FRIEND was getting married. I told her if she didn’t want me at the wedding, fine. I don’t give a fuck since I won’t go to a wedding if the bride is going to be so rude to a guest. 

Matthew and our friends found out and I was getting texts left and right begging me to just come to the wedding. I told them I was happy to get uninvited and I’ll just spend the day with my boyfriend on the day of the wedding instead. They’re all mad at me for not fighting hard enough. 

AITA?

Edit: so my decision is final. I will not be going to the wedding and there’s no changing my mind about it. I will be sending a wedding gift to Matthew the day prior to the wedding instead. I told Matthew and all my friends that I won’t be going and they can’t convince me otherwise. Matthew also called me and asked if we can talk somewhere. I agreed but it’s to tell him in person that I won’t go so that way he knows I’m serious about that. 

Update: I met up with Matthew and brought my boyfriend along. Of course, he begged me to come to the wedding and he said he would beg Jennifer to let me attend. I told him it’s best if I wasn’t there. I told Matthew that Jennifer has a problem with me. Period. He said he doesn’t understand and he did ask her many times but Jennifer would continue to say she was just “stressed”. I got angry and said that’s bullshit and he knows that. My boyfriend also intervened and said to Matthew that he needs to wake up and realize Jennifer is crazy and he can’t keep defending her. Matthew said he loves her too much and doesn’t want to lose her. My boyfriend and I got up and told Matthew to let us know when he has a backbone. In the meantime, it’s best we don’t talk. I messaged all of our friends in the group to let them know I’m keeping a distance from Matthew because of Jennifer. He’s still my friend but at an arms length. I will still be sending him a gift regardless but I’m keeping my distance from Matthew. It seems like he is in denial and can’t comprehend what’s going on at all. He usually is in denial, ever since high school he would have a sense of denial. 

Another thing to mention is that Jennifer is nice to all of Matthew’s female friends. Just not with me. I’ve also gotten a message from two of our friends saying they have dropped out of attending the wedding because of Jennifer and that they are on my side. 

Edit 2: Jennifer already bought her wedding dress a while ago. When I went dress shopping with Matthew’s sister, she invited Jennifer as a way to resolve this animosity she had towards me. So it was Matthew’s sister who wanted to buy a dress and I found a dress that I loved and Jennifer went crazy. Hope that clears things up since so many were confused.

1c3c7mw,AITA My husband tells me to stop asking for help and just do it myself,"Today my husband, my 15 month old son and I went to a friends place for her birthday celebration. While eating i was holding my son and asking for a napkin because he was making me and himself wet and dirty. And as my hands where full and my son was sitting on my lap i asked my husband as nice as i can for a napking. For this he had to get up and walk 5 meters…but he decided that i dont need one and made a joke to use my pants to smear the mess on….And i asked again. Nope he did not get one still….

Anyways..in the car later i told him i did not understand why he cant help me and he said again that he thought it is no needed to get a napkin… but if i ask that means i need one. He disagrees. He got mad at me for telling him this and said i should not nagg because afterall he spent sll day with me and for me with my friends.

also: he told me next time i should just give him the baby and go get them myself

AITA for asking for help???

update: this morning he acted very kind to me: asked how i slept, if he should cook for me and he cleaned alot. This tells me i was right to be upset and he knows that he was not good to me. but he has not talked to me about it yet or apologized.

Also thank you for all the powerfull comments and different opinions! I dont think he deserves all the harsh comments and also divorce is not necesarry. But he has to improve!

update 2: so far all he talked to me was about helping me or if i need something. and one thing was especially surprising today: he packed an emtpy luggage with winter clothes to make more room in the closet! first i thought he is leaving. but then he asked:“ i am putting my winter clothes away! thats s good idea no??“ with s cute voice. but no apology or explanation yet. And as long as i dont get this i wont interact more than necessary.

  
update 3: we talked snd he was sorry for all the points i needed to hear to be sure we think the same way and have similar values. He told me he had a little bit too much to drink and wanted to be funny but he knows also he should not do it like this. Also he explained me that when i mentioned the napkin he got mad because he helped me alot this day and all i do is finish the day with complaining about one thing instead of seeing all the good things he did. In the future he will tell me for example:“ i will help you more next time and take it seriously when you need me but i am also sad that all you think of was this one mistake i made when the rest of the day i put so much effort in.“

  
So no divorce, no abuse :) but it was really not fine!!",Majestic-Price-4879,7628,0.9399999976158142,1579,1713042457,2024-04-13 16:07:37,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1c3c7mw/aita_my_husband_tells_me_to_stop_asking_for_help/,4,2024
1caofb9,"AITA for telling my overweight friend that I maintain my body through a healthy lifestyle, NOT genetics?","A few years back, 7 of my friends from high school and I decided that no matter where we lived or how busy we were, we were going to meet each other for brunch once a year for the rest of our lives. We don’t have an exact date, but we usually pick a week in June or July when it is warm, and fly/drive to our hometown for bottomless brunch at our favorite spot. Keep in mind that for some of us, this is the only time of the year that we see each other. I, in particular, live 2500 miles away, so I hardly see any of these girls. Regardless, it is always a good time, until recently when one of my friends “Rue” would not stop commenting on my food intake.

For some background, I am and always have been a very active person. I ran track and cross country for our college and I now compete in ultramarathons. For this reason, I eat a lot of calories, and I stay pretty thin. I also eat reasonably healthy, balanced meals most of the time. However, for the one day a year at our favorite restaurant, NOTHING is off limits. I eat plate after heaping plate of cheesy eggs, pancakes, hash browns, sausage, bacon–literally I could eat the entire menu.

Rue has always been on the heavier side. While I don’t really pay attention to someone’s weight changes or eating habits, Rue points it out, so I can’t help but notice. “Every year I eat nothing but oatmeal and I keep getting bigger and bigger, and \[OP\] is over there gorging herself and is stick thin!” “It’s like every calorie \[OP\] eats shows up on MY body!” Soon my friends started to chime in, saying that I was lucky I have such good genetics and can eat whatever I want. This really bothered me in part because it completely invalidated the work I do to maintain my healthy body, but also because I could tell Rue was frustrated with her weight, and I felt my friends were doing more harm than good.

I explained that I do not normally eat like this, and I also exercise very frequently, and that people shouldn’t look at a snapshot of someone’s life and think that’s how they live on the daily. I also said eating salads for every meal and never enjoying a meal out with friends is just going to make her more frustrated, which will slow her progress. I thought this was going to be helpful advice, but my friends all looked at me livid. One of them called me incredibly privileged and said I wasn’t aware of my privilege, and accused me of shaming Rue. The rest of them followed suit and told me to get off my high horse. Eventually I’d had enough. I said I was just trying to help and that they’re only going to hurt Rue (Rue was silent the whole time. I packed up my things, paid my bill, and left.

Now I’m feeling torn because it’s been a few days and none of these people will talk to me. I reached out to the person in the group I was closest with and she said I really overstepped and should apologize to the group and at least to Rue. I had good intentions, but if these people won’t talk to me, maybe I screwed up.

1c1ui93,WIBTA for telling my in-laws that we can't afford a fancy restaurant and that we are not contributing to paying for the meal?,"My father-in-law's birthday is coming up and my partner received a message from his sister saying that she and MIL have booked a restaurant for FILs birthday. We were not asked about our opinions or price range or included in the discussion. Quickly looking at the restaurant information, I can see that they have a set menu and single price of about $120AUD per person, and that is excluding drinks. Drinks are an additional $30 per person for a package or $15-20+ for a single small glass of wine (minimum some are apparently$60-90 per glass- not that I would order that)!

We told my partner's sister that this is well out of our price range at the moment due to having a single income and a lot of unexpected bills. She said she didn't care and to ""work something out"" as they have booked this restaurant and it is for their father's birthday. 

We have tried to tell MIL (we are not allowed to mention where we are going to FIL) that it is too expensive and we have just been brushed off and told that we are going and too bad.

Every person involved knows of our financial situation and went ahead and booked an expensive restaurant without speaking to us first-- we were just told.

My partner is angry at his sister and thinks she is inconsiderate. She thinks that we are being unreasonable in our concerns about how expensive this meal will be (we pay less for our electricity!).",quietquesti0ns,4914,0.9700000286102295,913,1712879790,2024-04-11 18:56:30,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1c1ui93/wibta_for_telling_my_inlaws_that_we_cant_afford_a/,4,2024
1ccbdnc,AITA for not explaining to my sister why she was stupid for asking me to share my art supplies.,"I babysit for my sister all the time. She pays me the same as anyone else. But she is a lot more entitled than anyone else. 

My nephews are really good kids but spoiled. They eat when they are supposed to and a don't need to wrangle them much to get them to bed. However they are fascinated with my art supplies. I am not an artist. I just like to draw. I have a few apps on my iPad but I like my paper and pencils as well. I also have oil pastel crayons. 

My nephews wanted to draw with them but I said no. They complained to my sister and she told me to let them draw with me. 

The next time I came by I brought pencil crayons for them. Not good enough. They complained and she said I was being mean not sharing. 

Time before last I just didn't bring anything except a book to read. She gave me shit for being immature. 

Fine I gave up. I bought them them some cheap oil crayons. I gave them to her as I was leaving. 

She called me today. She gave them the crayons but did not supervise them. She has spent the last two days trying to get the oil paint off her couch and carpet. She says my brother-in-law is pissed that I gave them art supplies that are so messy. I forwarded her the messages where she called me childish and mean for not sharing. I offered to send them to her husband so he could know whose idea it was. 

She is mad and demanding that I watch them for free to pay her back for the cleaning. I just said I would not watch the kids any more. She tried to trick me by not having cash when I showed up. I said I was leaving since I didn't trust that she would pay me. Strangely she actually had the cash. 

She did call our mom and tell on me for giving the kids oil paints without warning her. 

My mom wants me to keep the peace and offered to pay me to watch the kids and let my sister think she won. I'm thinking about it.

1c9uviz,"AITA for repossessing my daughters car, after she took $20K for a wedding that never happened","My 26 yo daughter (Helen) & I always had a good relationship up until a few years ago. She started dating Marco in her final year of college. That same year, her mother & I separated. It was amicable, & we agreed on divorce terms without any disputes. 

After her graduation in 2021, she & Marco became engaged. I was very happy for her, however encouraged her to think about a long engagement, given they are both only now entering the workforce. She did say her ideal wedding location was booked out for 3 years, and they intended to save up for it. I told her that I would contribute $20K to her wedding. I also purchased her a car for her graduation, however kept the registration in my name.

Helen started to become distant, but whenever I asked if everything was ok, she said yes, & denied there was any issue. I just hoped everything would return to normal.

In April & of the blue, Helen posted on FB to announce that she & Marco had eloped & married at the registers office, with her mother, & MIL/FIL as witnesses. She said that they were planning on using their savings as a house deposit, & would have a small gathering at their home in lieu of a reception. I was so shocked & hurt that I found out in this way. I would have completely supported this decision had she spoken to me.

I called her to ask why I was not invited, & she said it wasn't personal, they just wanted to elope. I finally told her that I have been hurt the last few years with her being more distant, & I missed how close we were. Again, she didn't say much but was very cold & distant. I told her that the $20K I had given her was to be used for the wedding, & this is when she lost her temper, saying that if I was ready to part with that money for the wedding, why should she return it now? She would use the $20K as part of the house deposit, thought that's what i would have wanted, & hung up on me.

She ignored my calls/texts for the next week, apart from her finally responding to my last message with 'f\*\*\* off'. Here is where I may have been the AH. After I received that msg, I arranged for her vehicle to be towed back to my house. I sent her a text saying she had effectively been phasing me out of her life, clearly doesn't respect me, & I don't like that she feels entitled to take the money I had gifted her under false pretences.

Since then, both she/her mother have been blowing up my phone calling me every name under the sun, & she has told me she wants nothing more to do with me. I feel that had she told me she wanted to elope & save for a house instead, I would have offered her financial help, however her entitlement to think she is owed the money irrespective how she treats me is what i have an issue with. Where I feel i may have been an AH is that I think that taking back the car might have just been a petty thing to do to my daughter. I really don't want to give the car back to her after what she has said to me, but i just need to know if i overreacted or not - ready to accept my judgement.",agonisedfath,4504,0.9700000286102295,1026,1713738958,2024-04-21 17:35:58,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1c9uviz/aita_for_repossessing_my_daughters_car_after_she/,4,2024

1ccambx,AITA for yelling at my mom because she ate the food that I bought with my money?,"
Our fridge is usually close to empty. There’s always condiments, eggs and some sort of shredded cheese but that’s it. Usually cream for coffee too which I sometimes use for cereal. The pantry is full of dried pasta, Cheerios and granola bars that are strictly for my sister. My dad locks away all of the good food for himself and wears the key around his neck like fucking Zoey101.  So there’s nothing to really make besides scrambled eggs, cereal or pasta. Yeah I should be grateful that there’s food at all but I’m sorry I can’t just live off of those things. Plus I have a really sensitive stomach so a lot of dairy and gluten will destroy my stomach.

 Yesterday, I bought my own food and left it in the fridge. Starved myself all day for as long as possible so I could eat towards the end of the day to not go to bed hungry. I got a big enough meal to eat half last night and half tonight. I don’t make enough money to buy solid meals for myself all the time so I was really looking forward to not eating the same old thing yet again. I opened the fridge today when I was hungry to the point of vomiting and the majority of my food was gone. Maybe a bite or two left but nothing I could actually get full off of. So naturally I got pissed because I’m starving, I paid for it with the little money I have in the first place and my mom didn’t even ask. So I walked into her (home) office and asked her if she ate my food. Her argument was that she thought it was old from days ago when she literally knows I came home with it last night. I even got her something too which she ate for dinner last night!!!!Then I got even more mad saying I’m starving and haven’t eaten anything in over 24 hours. She started bawling her eyes out and my dad started screaming at me for being over dramatic. Then she dramatically left the house saying she’s gonna blow off work for the rest of the day to go and get me the same meal. My dad ran out and took the keys from her before she could leave then came inside saying she’s crying. 

So not only did she eat my food, she guilt tripped me and made me feel like I’m the reason why she’s not gonna make any money today. Because she ate my food that I starved myself for. I think I feel extra guilty because we get along well but this isn’t the first time it’s happened. When I told my sister she sighed and rolled her eyes because this has happened to her too with the same excuse. All I know is that I’m mad, feel guilty and have extremely low blood sugar so I might just sleep it off or something. Am I the asshole for reacting the way I did?

1bxo3yx,AITA for defending my son for using a different language when he was upset during an argument at kindergarten?,"I (36F) have been married to my wonderful wife (Anna - 35F) for the past 10 years. We have a 5 year old son, Liam.

Anna and I both work during the day so Liam spends the time until one of us can pick him up at his kindergarten. The other day, Liam's teacher called me and said they would appreciate if we both were available when we picked him up, because he had gotten in an argument and they wanted to talk to us.

Initially I was worried so I moved a few of my meetings and called my wife. We both went to pick him up. The whole issue was he had gotten in an argument with a girl over the rules of a game they were playing. The teacher said as he got angry, he started speaking in a different language, and no one could understand what he was on about. The other kid's parents said it was offensive to speak in a way that no one understood and we should have taught him better.

Now, I am a Greek woman, my wife is French. We live in an English-speaking country. While Liam can certainly speak English, he occasionally uses Greek and French. Both Anna and I learned each other's languages so our household is a mix of all three at different times. He picked up on both of them and can speak them more or less.

I said we have clearly taught him well since he has been able to speak in other languages fluently this whole time but only slipped when he was frustrated during an argument. I said it was in no way offensive, that it was human reaction, and that Liam would surely get it under his full control over time but he is FIVE now so maybe we all should take a deep breath.

The other kid's parents were extremely mad saying their daughter was so upset she cried after the argument and that Liam had to apologise about making her feel this frustration via using another language. My wife answered them with the same overall point as I did but they didn't back down. Even the teacher said we had to work on Liam not making this a recurring theme which is fair.

After the meeting was over and we were going to drive away, the other kid's dad made a comment along the lines of 'you're all arrogant rich people driving cars like this and thinking whatever you're doing is right.' In front of the kids. I got really mad and said I hope you're a better parent than what I'm guessing you are. 

After we went home, Anna and I did tell Liam to not speak to othet peoole in a language they don't understand. Later we talked among ourselves and wondered if we really did escalate the whole argument even more. I am asking on behalf of both us. Were we TA?

1cgeffp,AITA For not considering the baby part of the family,"AITA For refusing to give up the baby items?

Ex and I were married for 20 years.  We had 2 kids together.  Our son was the 6th grand child 💙 born on his side, and our daughter was the 7th grand child and first Grand daughter 🩷 on that side. There were 5 more kids born after her.
On my side, our kids were the first grandchildren.

I have always been into vintage/ handmade items.  MIL would make blankets / sweaters / booties / mittens for all the babies.  When our daughter was born she also made rompers and dresses for her.  The other 'daughters' never appreciates what she did. In addition to what SHE made, she also gave us the sweaters that were given to her son (my husband) by his Nannies (grandmothers).  My mother, (first grandchildren) would shop at $$$ boutiques for out fits for my kids 🙄 She finally came to reality and started shopping cheaper.

My kids also wore the Christening gown that MY grandmother had worn. (Yeah, it was old).

In addition to the clothing, there were toys.  Toys from their grandparents when they were babies.  Toys from  their father's side that none of his siblings wanted for their babies.   Toys from my side I wanted them to have. Toys they got as gifts. And yes, I had all the toys tested for safety before I allowed the kids to have them.


The kids grew up and out these things.  I packed these items up in boxes so that when our children have children of their own, these things will be available for them if they want them.


Our marriage didn't last.  He walked our on us, and left all boxes (baby items) with me.  He quickly remarried. 


His wife has a daughter that was out of the house when they married. The daughter, recently had a baby.  Now, his wife had seen photos of our children wearing some of the items I had saved up, and SHE feels that since HER daughter had 'the first grandchild' 🙄 that SHE (her daughter) is entitled to all the baby items I had saved for future grandchildren.

AITA ... He walked away and left all the baby items with me. I saved the items so that OUR children will have them (if they desire) for THEIR children (OUR grandchildren).  They (him & wife) feel that since his wife's daughter gave birth, she is just as entitled to the saved baby items as our children are.

And yes, I could ask ex-MIL what she would like me to do with the items, but I really don't want to get her involved if I don't have to.

I MIGHT be TA for not allowing my ex to give baby items from OUR kids that I saved for their future children to his wife so she could present them to her own (already existing) grand babies.

1cd47ej,AITA? Choosing Daughter over Husband?,"My husband (m,64) and I (f,65) have been married for 20 years.  He has two sons, Jason and Craig both married (m,41 and 39).  I have two daughters Jenna and Kiera both married (f, 38 and 37).   All of our kids are independent and living on their own.  His boys have families but don’t live anywhere near us.  My girls recently received an inheritance from their grandfather of close to 1 million each.  They are being responsible with it.  One is saving a big portion of it for retirement and her son’s education.  The other doesn’t have kids and doesn’t live near us.  So this is about the one who lives close to us and has a pre-school son, Kyle. 

My husband has gotten very upset lately about the help I am giving Jenna with babysitting Kyle before pre-school and in the afternoons 2-3 days a week.  He is a good eater and likes things that are driving up our food bill maybe 40-50.00 a month.  Husband resents me not getting paid for the food and to a lesser degree  my time.  He says it isn’t fair to his grandkids that they are not being treated fairly.  I suggested he send the grandkids’ parents money for treats each month.  He wants me to charge Jenna and then not have to give his grandkids anything.  I don’t want to charge Jenna anything.  I don’t think that grandparents should charge for childcare or food. 

He gets aggravated if he sees a new colouring book or markers here. He seethes with rage at times if I invite Jenna’s family for a meal.   He thinks Jenna and to a lesser degree Kiera should be helping us instead of hoarding their money.   He also gets very agitated about me not telling him if Kyle is going to be here.  He says that he doesn’t feel like it is his home and that I make all the decisions.  He is threatening to break up our marriage over the disparity and unfairness of the situation.  

Some info on our finances: Money isn’t plentiful but we both have pretty good pensions. After our bills are paid we have between 2 and 3 thousand a month to spend on groceries, gas and other miscellaneous expenses. We have very minimal savings.   He travels to see his grandkids maybe 2-3 times a year.  One he flies to see and the other he takes the train or drives.  Averages out maybe 500.00 a trip.  I don’t travel at all.

He thinks I am  the AH because I am willing to risk our marriage over this.  If we divorce we will have to sell our house and neither one of us will be able to afford to live to the standard we have now.

1c93w9u,AITA For keeping my kids away from their new uncle?,"
I have been with my wife “L” for 11 years now. We have two kids together, a 2 year old girl and a 6 month old son. My SIL, M, was beyond excited when she found out we were expecting, and wanted to be very involved in our kids lives as the “cool aunt” because she herself believed she would never have children.

Last year, M asked our group of friends, “If you were talking to someone, and they threw up several red flags in their personality, but they treated you nicely, would you continue to pursue that relationship?” We all, of course, said no. Red flags exist for a reason. But then, a week later, she introduces my family to her new boyfriend “R” and his daughter “S”. Before doing so, M made a note to tell me that R was conservative, which i thought was odd. We are all very progressive, and “M” more so than the rest of us, so i thought it was a bit weird but that’s ok. R was quiet throughout the dinner and after that, we didn’t see him for a while, though M continued to be very involved in our lives. 

A few months later, we went on a family vacation and “R” tagged along. On the very first morning, i was sitting in the floor playing with our daughter while a children’s show with a black man as the main character played on the tv. He walked over to M and whispered something to her and she got up and turned off the tv. When i asked why, she said that R didn’t want S (a 7 year old) watching it. Ok, whatever, it was background noise anyway. Then, when she went back to him, i heard him say “-that fucking queer” to her, referring to the main character. I was APPALLED. M is bi so i was astounded that he would say that to her and even more so that she laughed after he did. We parted ways for the day but that night, we all met back up for dinner. I wasn’t feeling well so i left early, but later that night my wife told me that he made several racist comments about the black family seated next to us with my daughter right there at the table. At that point i’d had it. I did not want this person around my kids. 

When the trip was over, i told M that i thought she was making a huge mistake with this guy, that he wasn’t “conservative”, he was homophobic and racist and i don’t want my kids growing up thinking it was ok to hate people because they’re different. She got very upset with me because this meant he wouldn’t be allowed at family holidays if my children were there, and that if i just spent a little more time with him, i would see he wasn’t all that bad. I refused. This caused a massive argument between L and M and now, M said that if R wasn’t allowed around my kids, she wouldn’t be a part of our lives any longer. To make matters worse, she’s now pregnant after believing herself infertile, and her and R are getting married next weekend. Now my wife wants us to go to couples counseling because she’s convinced that i’m overreacting about this. If she wants us to go to counseling, that’s fine with me, but i don’t think that i’ve done anything wrong.

1c2m1ew,AITA for wanting an ASL interpreter at my brother’s wedding because my boyfriend is deaf?,"I (42 F) will be officiating my brother’s (37) wedding next month. Several months ago asked my brother and his fiance (35 F) if I could make arrangements and pay for for an ASL interpreter to be present for the ceremony since my boyfriend (43 M) is deaf and I cannot support his communication while officiating the wedding. After some discussion, my brother said that I could as long as the interpreter would not be in any photos. I made the arrangements and informed my boyfriend that I had secured an interpreter. Yesterday I received an email with the wedding day itinerary from the wedding day coordinator and it did not mention the interpreter’s arrival time. As a courtesy, I asked my brother’s fiance if the coordinator needed to know the interpreter’s arrival time. In summary, her response was that they decided that I cannot have the interpreter at the wedding because they are not hiring an interpreter for her non-English speaking family members, and they would be providing paper copies of the ceremony script for the non-English speaking guests in their native languages, and I could print it out for my boyfriend if I wanted. I expressed that my boyfriend needs the  accommodation of an interpreter, which I would be providing and paying for, in order to participate like everyone else, and that having a disability and being a non-English speaker are not comparable. She also said that she did not know I hired an interpreter because she thought the idea was discussed but a decision hadn’t been made. When I questioned my brother he said that there was a miscommunication, admitted that he did say I could hire an interpreter, but is now agreeing with his fiance. I have tried explaining why this is not acceptable and that my boyfriend needs an interpreter for the ceremony. I even gave the example that this would be like telling a guest with mobility problems that he or she can’t use his or her own wheelchair at the wedding, and argued that it is their choice to not provide an interpreter for their non-English speaking guests since they do not think it is fair to have an interpreter present for my boyfriend, but not their non-English speaking guests. They could provide interpreters for everyone who needs one if they wanted and I am sure that if her family wanted to provide an interpreter for their guests, it would not be an issue because we had already discussed having her brother translate for me while I am officiating, but he did not want to.

1bubgh7,UPDATE - Brother of the bride’s girlfriend lost it on me and got dropped from the wedding party as a result,"So, I saw a lot of people saying they wanted an update and people were really kind offering advice so thought I would provide some closure on this saga. 

I decided that it would be best to speak to Jane and confirm how she wanted to play it. I told her as much as I don’t want to deal with Kathy I’m not seriously going to stick to the ultimatum. Jane said she is definitely not having Kathy as a bridesmaid, and that she’s sorry it even came to me having to say that. We agreed that Jane would handle any questions about Kathy and say that it wasn’t about my ultimatum. 

On Jane and the bridesmaid thing, a lot of people were saying her aesthetic choice didn’t make sense, and you were partially correct. She admitted she mostly just didn’t want Elliot and Kathy to be photographed together. i told her she’s a complete moron (affectionately) for not telling me because we could have prepared this better. 

Elliot and I also met up to talk. 

He explained that Kathy has a bad relationship with her family, that’s why she was really hoping to bond with his. He also said she has a lot of insecurities and that she projected a lot of these issues onto me. As for why, he shed some light on this, too. Elliot’s best friend (my family by marriage) shared some things with her and kind of over-egged some stories and it set Kathy on this path of thinking I was Regina George, basically. Elliot has tried to correct her but she won’t hear it.

As for her thinking I’m trying to “steal” him, some of you were right. She does think that my hanging out with his family means I must not dislike him as much as I say. She thinks because I have a history of dating people close to him (two people years apart) that I must secretly like him. Elliot agrees this is crazy but Kathy just won’t let go of this idea. 

As for us walking together, I said I would support him asking Jane if he could walk with another bridesmaid but that if she insists, I’m going to be on her side and Elliot agreed that was fair. 

He said he’s been trying to be understanding of her issues but he sees now it was wrong to force the bridesmaid issue and he’s going to focus on helping Kathy in a way that doesn’t involve everyone else from now on. I left it there in regards to Kathy because it’s not my place to comment. 

Our conversation actually turned out to be pretty productive, elliot and I aired out a lot of things from when we were kids that I guess were overdue a conversation. We’ll never be best friends but we are getting a joint Father’s Day gift for his dad so that’s something. 

I’m still going to be as civil to Kathy because honestly she clearly has a lot bigger issues than whatever issues she has with me and adding to it just seems pointless. 

That’s that. All’s well that ends…decently, all things considered. We will definitely be watching her for any drama at the wedding but for now that’s it.

1c05j41,AITA for laughing at a friend that said my mother took advantage of my dad after their divorce? ,"I (19f) am an international student. I was with a friend recently, and we landed on the topic of parents. Our parents divorced when we were really young, so this kinda became a venting session for both of us lol. 

In my case, my parents divorced when I was 6 and they had shared 50/50 custody of me.

Then we got on the topic of child support, and this was where things got weird. I’m Muslim, and I was born and raised in a Muslim country with Sharia law. And under sharia law, it is the fathers that bear the sole financial (key word: financial) responsibility of having children. 

So when my parents divorced, although both my parents have good jobs, and were earning similar amounts at the time of the divorce, my father had to pay my mother child support for the time she would have me. 

And my friend thought this was incredibly weird. She asked me why my mother agreed to accept the child support if she didn’t need the money.

The simple answer: my parents are religious. My mother believes  that it is my father’s responsibility to financially provide for me, not hers. My father believes the same.  

My friend kind of laughs and says it’s easy to be religious in a situation like that when you can get money you don’t need off your ex. I laughed at her. It was funny.

She gets pretty offended that I laughed at her and she asked me why. I told her she doesn’t know anything about my parents but she automatically assumes the worst of my mother. Honestly, laughing at her was kinder than anything I would’ve said to her at that moment. 

She pretty much stops talking to me at that point and now I’m wondering whether I should reach out to make amends.

Recently my wife has been complaining about the difficulty of her job more and the amount of work she has to put in following a workday. I work about 50-60 hrs a week whereas she works 40hrs a week and I have tried to increase the amount of home work I do over the weekends lately.

The problem for me lies in the fact that we take both kids to daycare which costs a pretty big chunk of our budget and is more or less 70-80% of her income per month. I make enough for all of us to be more or less in the same financial situation with a few more overtime hours a week if she quit her job. 

And since she has been complaining recently when she started venting yesterday I told her she might as well quit and just take care of the boys, and id bump up a few hrs since it's pretty much the same type of work (she works in social care). According to her I'm minimising her work and just not focusing on the real problem.

As all three kids are in the midst of puberty, they have been packing down food like crazy. But it doesn't matter to me, I just buy and make more food since I really enjoy cooking. The food in question isn't like brownies and cake and mostly unhealthy stuff, but stuff that we normally eat. They always come back for seconds and thirds and stuff. 

  
Yesterday, I made chicken wings, Suya, and rice (weird combo I know). I made about 25 chicken wings, 15 suya sticks, and a lot of rice. After everyone had eaten, there was basically nothing left over, and I guess my mom picked up on the fact, since during cleanup, she told me she felt like these kids were eating ""too much"" and I should stay consistent on certain food portions, and after that no more. I don't know about you guys, but I felt that was a terrible idea since I feel like every teenagers eats like crazy.

He works remotely while I work in person M-F and don’t get home until 6:30-7ish pm most days. Earlier today, he texted me saying he spoke to an old friend (33f apparently) of his because she moved to a city 3 hours from us and after hearing about the things that happened in her life recently, invited her to come stay with us for a few days. 

He told me that both her parents and her brother passed away within a few months of each other recently (around a year ago) and she only has a sister left as part of her family now who she’s away from atm. She also recently broke up with her BF who she had been dating for a few years, not sure who broke up with whom. He said she seemed very distraught during their phone call and he didn’t really know what to say or how to console her, that he felt really bad for her, especially because she’s mostly alone now. She said she was off from Thursday to Sunday next week so he invited her to come and stay with us for that time.

I know and have met most of his friends but this is the first time I’m hearing of her, but it might be understandable because I haven’t met people he knew from 8 years ago unless they live close by. What I think really pissed me off was that he didn’t ask me if it would be okay, more or less just gave me a heads up that he invited her. I’m normally all for helping a friend out in a time of need but i expected him to ask me and make sure I’m okay with it before inviting someone over like that. I’m not comfortable with a female friend of his being in the house alone with him for a few days while I’m not around for most of the day. I don’t know this person or what they’re thinking so while I trust my husband, I don’t trust her. Grief and loss also makes you act in ways you might not normally act in and the fact that she had a recent breakup isn’t comforting either so I feel like letting this happen would be like inviting trouble into my marriage. I also know for a fact that if something inappropriate happened, even if she initiated it and my husband shut it down, I would lose trust in him for bringing this situation about despite me not being okay with it.

1cdx6jv,AITA for refusing to return a gift I was given 7 years ago?,"For context, I was dating a girl in college who went to Thailand and got me a handmade machete as a gift. I have kept it through the years, but it's mostly just been in my garage and I use it for random things like cutting boxes up to fit in the trash can. 

Long story short, we broke up over 7 years ago and she blocked me on every form of social media and other forms of communication. Last night, her friend (who I'm not friends with on Facebook) messaged me on Facebook saying that my ex-girlfriend wanted the machete back. I was pretty taken aback by the request and asked why she didn't reach out to me directly and pointed out how strange it was to make that request, especially after not talking to me for nearly a decade. She acted like I was an asshole for insinuating that the request was tacky and strange. The majority of my friends think the request is ridiculous and I should tell her to kick sand, but some friends are saying if I hardly use it, why not just give it back? I don't really care that much about having the machete, but the principle**(ETA) of it just really rubs me the wrong way.

1buc68g,AITA for laughing when my MIL and SIL got chewed out by my fiance?,"This is completely stupid and if nothing else might give y'all a good laugh too. 

I (27m) am getting married to my fiancee (26f) later this year. She's an incredible woman and I'm the luckiest man alive to have her in my life. Unfortunately, she comes attached to a very entitled and self absorbed family. I genuinely don't know how my fiancee ended up as amazing as she is with these people around. The main players in this conflict are my MIL (53f) and SIL (24f) to be. When my fiance and I announced our engagement last year SIL had a complete breakdown, throwing a full on tantrum that she deserved to get married first and my fiancee should be forced to wait. I was so confused by this reaction, but my fiancee just looked bored, which confused me even more. Apparently her sister does this a lot when she feels she deserves something more than my fiance. MIL took SIL’s side saying that dating wasn't as easy for her. My fiancee always tells them off for being annoying and ridiculous and they hate it, which is kind of funny to me. So here's where I need some help.

Three weeks ago I got into a nasty car crash and my left leg is broken in multiple places. The doctors say I'll likely have a permanent limp even after I heal because of how bad the injury is and might even need a cane. My fiancee is an absolute angel and has been by my side every step of the way. I'm going to need a couple different surgeries and some serious physical therapy before I can properly walk again, and she's been pushing my wheelchair since I got home. MIL and SIL stopped by yesterday and that's where the trouble is. SIL asked my fiancee when she would be leaving me. Flat out, while I was in the room. MIL also chimed in saying a wheelchair or cane would look horrible in wedding pictures so it would be best for her to cancel and leave. I was horrified. I didn't even get to open my mouth before my fiancee went absolutely ballistic at her mom and sister. She told them that they were delusional if they believed she was that shallow. She kicked them out almost immediately saying she was done and over their BS. They both looked like they sucked on extra sour lemons. I couldn't help laughing at their expressions. This was apparently what did it for them and they both huffed off still insisting they were just looking out for my fiancee. I laughed for a solid couple minutes before calming down. My fiancee just looked so exhausted so we had some cheer up snuggles.

I've been getting messages from SIL all day saying that me laughing at them wanting my fiancee to not have to spend the rest of her life looking after me was completely uncalled for and I'm an AH. She makes it sound like I'm completely paralyzed and I'll need 24/7 care until I die. I don't think I did anything wrong but what do you guys think? Should I have kept my laughter to myself? AITA?

Update: Hey y'all. This thing got a lot more attention than I thought it would considering how dumb the whole situation is. But I'm actually glad it did, because I've been reading the comments with my fiancee and we're both seeing how fucked up her mom and sister's behavior actually is. She said she hadn't even thought about going no contact since she was just so used to their BS, but now we're really talking about pulling the trigger. MIL and SIL have also officially been uninvited from the wedding, which they did not take well, especially MIL. SIL is blocked on my phone now, but her and MIL still message my fiancee. It's a little hard for her to block them completely just yet, but we'll keep working on it. 

And for those of you who've asked where the FIL was during all this, I don't actually know. He divorced MIL a long time ago and doesn't have contact with her or his daughters anymore. My fiancee says she doesn't care or miss him because he was just as bad as MIL and SIL. 

Lastly for those asking, yes I absolutely did spoil my fiancee later after they left. I already mentioned snuggles, but we also got her favorite take out and binged this new show she's been wanting to check out. It was actually really good. We can't do much bedroom wise right now, but I promise if I could I would have. I'm not sure if I'll update again. Maybe if something significant happens. But until then, I have a surgery to prep for in the next two weeks.

1c2m00c,AITA for refusing to lend my daughter out to my SIL for a “mommy and me tea”?,"I never really had a good relationship with my SIL Sheila. She has two boys with her husband, my hubby’s older brother. Both of her sons are special needs.
I think Sheila has always resented me for having only girls. She is very feminine, likes to her hair and nails done, go out for girls nights and she doesn’t show much interest in her sons’ activities. She’s always talked about how nice it would be to take her hypothetical daughter shopping or brunch instead of being home alone while Brandon takes the boys out to basketball games or fishing. She adores my younger daughter because she’s at that age where she still loves ballerinas, princesses and anything pink and girly. 

Over Easter, Sheila asked if my younger daughter wanted to come to a “mommy and me tea” for Mother’s Day. I said no, because my hubby and I are already planning something for Mothers Day. And I want to spend it with my girls.

Sheila broke down and mumbled something about how she wanted to do something fun instead of being stuck at home with her sons.

I felt bad for her. Sheila loves going out to eat but can’t take Cooper or Teddy along because they can’t cope with being still or in loud places with lots of people around. She and her husband haven’t gone out since Teddy was born and it’s hard to find a sitter. 

At the same time, my daughter isn’t a doll to placate her “girl mom” wants.

I feel worse now because we had a family dinner last night and Sheila broke down crying when someone asked what she had planned for Mother’s Day and that she just wanted to do “normal mom things” for once.

This whole thing makes me feel nauseous. When I talked about it to work colleagues over lunch, they suggested that I let Sheila take my Kate to lunch anyway. It will make her feel better, they said, and I’d be the asshole if I didn’t do something to help her. 

This whole situation really skeeves me out.

1cfk918,AITA for kicking my baby’s father out of the hospital room?,"I (19F) just had a baby 1 day ago. His father (21M) and I have not been together since November due to him cheating. He’s had a couple other girlfriends since then and is still with one of them currently, but he still did go to most of my appointments with me. 

2 days ago when I went into labor I called him, he came to pick me up to bring me to the hospital and he had his entire TV and playstation in the backseat, with no car seat for the baby. I told him he is not bringing that to the hospital and he told me if I want him to be there for our son’s birth he needs something to do to pass the time. We argued about it almost the entire ride to the hospital, but he ended up not bringing it in. 

I was only in labor for about 2 hours before I gave birth, he was there the entire time. A couple hours after I gave birth, my dad and sister came to visit and he left as the hospital has a 2 visitor only rule. I told him while they’re here visiting for him to go bring his TV back home and install the car seat so when they discharge us we will be all set. After a few hours my family leaves, and I text him to tell him he is welcome to come back if he would like. 

Around 20 minutes later he’s walking back into my room, carrying his TV. We start arguing about how I already told him he is not having that in my room and he starts yelling at me saying that I don’t make the rules and that I should be grateful that he wants to be there for our son but instead I’m trying to make him miserable. I told him he can either bring the TV back to his car or he can leave, he said he has a right to spend time with his son. 

I called my nurse into the room and told her I want him to leave, so they ended up kicking him out. He yelled at me the entire time he was leaving saying that I’m kicking him out of his son’s life and that he will be going to court for custody. He has texted me since saying that I’m taking his rights away from him and there is no rules that he couldn’t bring his own TV and game system while he spends time at the hospital.

I make dinner every night for myself (f in my 30s), my husband (m in his 30s), and our son (m 4). I don’t typically make things that take 100 dishes or leave a massive mess but there’s usually a couple of pots and pans, some utensils, and a cutting board. After I plate up our meals and serve we all eat together. My son is old enough to rinse his plate and put it in the dishwasher. My husband always does the same. I end up with all the the cooking dishes myself. I have brought this up to my husband and asked if he could do the dishes after I cook as I’m tired from doing the cooking. He says that since I made the mess I should deal with it myself. I was mad but didn’t ask again. The next night I made dinner that was just enough for me and my son. None for husband. He was confused. I told him if he wasn’t going to do his part for the meal then he could make his own. I think this is fair!

1c0xxd7,AITA for telling my wife that her SIL could not use our brand new SUV as her cousin's party ride,"Wife: 39, Me: 40, BIL: 32, BIL-Wife:32

Last week my wife told me that our brand new SUV was requested to be used as a ride and I thought it was for one of our kids school. Turns out it was her SIL (BIL wife), her SIL cousin is having a 'quinceanera' and they want to use our SUV as the ride for her.

I know her parents but not the uncle and aunt like friends or something like that, just seen them a few times at some reunions. Of course my response was not the best but I kind of laughed and said no way because it was unbelievable for me.

A little backstory: I grew up poor and I did not have much growing up, but I have worked so hard to earn and have what we own. And don't get me wrong, my wife is the sweetest woman I have ever met, she's kind and caring and always looking to help others when possible. She did not offer the SUV.

So now my wife is upset with me because I said no and the way I said it. I did not brought up the topic anymore and BIL and BIL-Wife went to my In-Laws and asked for their SUV instead. BIL-Wife argument was that renting a nice SUV was too expensive and they were 'ugly'.

Now I feel like our family doesn't like me or sees me as ""not nice, you could've help but didn't"". Oh well... AITA here?

1ch51za,"Update: AITA for refusing to pay for half of my ex-girlfriend’s flight that she can’t use because we broke up, and now possibly not even mine?","Hey, thanks to everyone who commented on my last post. I got so much more advice than I was expecting, and I appreciate it. A lot of you were saying the airline could do something. I told that to my ex, and she actually bought the tickets from a discount agency online and there was no refund possibility. If you’re curious, I can tell you how it all ended.  

I eventually told my ex that I was not going to pay her more than the $800 for my ticket under any circumstances, and she could take it or leave it and I’d just get my own ticket. She later asked if I’d be willing to let her use the AirBnb if she paid me the entire $1600, basically letting me out of the whole trip all together. To be honest, the Canary Islands were her idea in the first place. It’s not like it’s my #1 destination. I could take the money and go somewhere that I am more interested in. 

I asked my friend who was going to go with me if he’d be interested in something cheaper and closer. He hadn’t bought his plane ticket yet because he was waiting for me to sort everything out with my ex. 

We looked at options and decided to accept her offer and go to Belize. I had my ex agree in writing to pay for any fees or damages incurred at the AirBnb. I really don’t think there will be any. She’s not the type of person to damage a hotel room or something, but I just want to be sure. 

I got Venmoed the money by a male coworker of hers. They have been work friends for a while now, and I have met him a couple of times. I don’t know if this is like a couple’s thing or what. I don’t really think she cheated on me with him. I could see maybe her being interested in him possibly being a factor for our breakup. But I don’t even know if they are together or going as friends. 

At the end of the day, I don’t really care what she does. I got my money back, she gets her vacation. I’m guessing her coworker also bought his own plane ticket, so at the end of the day he’s the one eating the $800 loss. So he can have fun with that. My ex and I are technically “amicable” again, but I don’t really plan on talking to her again.

1cdywf6,AITAH for humbling my colleague that her age is irrelevant compared to our other colleague’s beautiful wife?,"So I have this colleague Jada (f26) who is very obviously in love (or in crush is maybe a better term since I believe true love comes after knowing a person) anyway, she is in crush with another colleague. This dude is 40 and he is stunningly handsome so I get the crush. Anyway he brought his wife to work once and she is as stunning if not even more. She looked around his age too. Then I knew for sure that she is 42 because Jada did some stalking online. She said eiw she is old. I thought it was a silly comment but ok.

But ever since, she’s been relentless in her attempts in pursuing our colleague. It had gotten out of hand and it was getting unbearable sincewe three work very close together. I confronted her and asked her what she was doing. You saw that he had a wife and he seems very happy in his marriage. 

“That old cow?”

The “cow” is maybe 120lbs. I ignored this comment. I told her she wasn’t old, she was his age. What I said next might be AH. I told her that she was crazy if she thought just because she was younger she would automatically have advantage over the wife since beauty outweighs youth. She got very upset and accused me of calling her ugly. Not at all I said, just that the wife is very VERY beautiful. Besides all of this isn’t important because he obviously loves his wife and to go ahead and try and if she succeeded, it won’t be because she is young and the wife is an old cow. It would be because the guy is a cheater or doesn’t love his wife.

1bw10xk,AITA for telling my daughter she knows nothing?,"I (41F) have a daughter who is 17, and her father and I divorced when she was 7. We had a very rocky marriage, during which I was a stay-at-home mom, and I struggled a lot financially afterwards. Because of this, during our divorce, my ex-husband and I agreed that our daughter would live mainly with him and I received alimony payments from him for about 4 years after our divorce.

For the first several years after the divorce, my daughter would stay with me every other weekend and several holidays (the specific holidays depending on the year), and I always enjoyed our time together, but it would often feel like she didn’t want to see me. She was never interested in any activities or occasions that I planned for us and normally when I called to talk to her, she would be busy with school, an extracurricular activity, or something else.

Usually when she would spend the night with me, she’d ask about the divorce and why her father and I aren't together anymore. I always tried to be as honest as possible with her but I could tell the divorce had been hard for her and when she started high school she stopped visiting altogether.

She and I have been low contact for the past few years, and this past weekend we had an argument regarding her graduation. She’s graduating from high school this June, and I texted her to ask about the details. She responded with a very passive aggressive text asking if I would actually come and how she didn’t want to waste a ticket.

I wasn’t sure where it was coming from, so I called her and she started ranting about how I was never around, and that I always blamed her father for everything, and how I cared about my students more than her (I’m a high school teacher). I interrupted her and told her that she knows nothing about what happened between her father and I.

I told her that she made her choice to stop visiting and not to answer when I call her and that she couldn’t blame anyone else for that and she hung up. About an hour later she sent me a long text about how much I hurt her and that she didn’t want me at her graduation and that I “needed to change”.

1c3cwlb,AITA for refusing to help a woman with her pregnancy bills because she had abandoned me during the day of our wedding?,"I am from India where arranged marriages are extremely common. 

My parents suggested a girl, Nandana. She was pretty, had a good job, etc.  I asked her whether she's fine with it, whether she's been asked to do it against her will, etc. She said she's agreeable to the marriage.

Months later, the wedding was supposed to be held, and on the day she appeared to not be talkative. She said (translating to English) ""It's true that I am not being forced, but that's because I haven't told my parents that I like someone else. I do not want to marry you. Please don't destroy my life.""

Needless to say, I was just numb. I wanted to yell, but I couldn't. 

I informed my parents about it, and then hers. There was an uproar. All of the hundreds of guests had to go back, and the wedding got cancelled. I am still single.

Some time back she called me to ask for help (pregnancy, etc). Apparently she left with the guy against her parents' wishes and married him, but he ditched her when she got pregnant. He's been isolating her from all her friends & doesn't have anyone to talk to. She had my number.

I straight-up refused, said that it's not my problem, etc. Some others who know about it are calling me cruel though.

1byh2ul,AITA for siding with my stepson over my wife about her being too overprotective?,"Quick backstory to this. I (42M) am married to a 54F (we’ll call her Janet) and she has a 35M son from her first marriage (we’ll call him Paul). Naturally, Janet had her son young and got married young. I’m closer in age to Paul than I am my wife, but I try to be a better father to him than his father who is way out of the picture at this point. Paul and I get along well, but he butts heads with my wife a lot. One of the biggest reasons is because she’s so overprotective of him, even though he is a grown man, has a career and lives by himself.

Paul is planning a 3 week trip to New Zealand this summer to visit some friends he has that live there as well as do some solo traveling around. He has traveled by himself before and Janet has always made him leave a copy of his itinerary. Janet again is asking him for a full itinerary complete with his friends’ addresses and phone numbers, hotels he will be staying at in other cities, etc. 

Paul told her that’s ridiculous that she needs all of that and that he’s a grown man, if she needs to reach him, she has his phone number. This turned into a huge argument where they both looked at me for my take. I was honest and told Janet that I think she’s being over the top and that he is a grown man. Later, this turned into an argument between Janet and I where she said I undermined her as a parent in front of her son and I should present a united front and not try to act like Paul’s big brother all the time instead of step father, etc.

So, AITA? Janet asked for my honest take and I gave it to her. Now she’s mad at me. Is it not unreasonable to give a grown 35 year old man his personal space when he travels without infantilizing him?

1cfj1of,AITA for using my friend's $20 after dinner?,"Yesterday, I went to Chili's (restaurant) with my friends. I paid for half of the meal, which was like $47. My friend gave me $20 to give to my parents because I used their card, so I went to give the $20 to my mom, and she said to keep it and use it for gas. Now, the other friend is saying I’m obligated to give the $20 back to her because my parents didn’t want it. It's her money, and she gave it to me under the impression it was going to my parents, but technically if I give it back, it'd mean she ate for free.",cutebunny2222,1365,0.949999988079071,349,1714343208,2024-04-28 17:26:48,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1cfj1of/aita_for_using_my_friends_20_after_dinner/,4,2024

1bxq7o4,AITA for sending my parents a picture of the Biblical Rebeccah every time they try to get in touch with me?,"I'm a 19 year old woman currently in college. I come from a churchy family, and there was a big fight two years ago when I decided to get a septum piercing and a nose ring. My parents thought it was trashy and whore-ish, and that only awful people get piercings like that and display them for everyone.   


I'm not really religious, but I've read a lot of the Bible, and in one of the fights I pointed out that the Biblical Matriarch Rebeccah, the wife of Isaac, wore a nose ring. (Strictly speaking, it's not 100% textually clear that she did; but when Eliezer gives her one and some bracelets in Genesis 24:22, and a few verses later  her brother notices her with the jewelry, and the bracelets are explicitly being worn, I think the reading is much more natural that she just put the jewelry on) And if they're really all about me being godly and following the teachings of the Bible, there shouldn't be any problems with me having a nose ring.  


That did not persuade them, and things have been a bit chilly since then, although the distance when I went off to university has helped some. Still, my folks have reached out on several occasions, once every other month or so, and most of the time, I'll respond, but usually send back pictures of some sort of image of Rebeccah in an icon or something. I have not come home in person since I went off to study.  


This morning, my uncle called up. I've gotten along better with him than most of my family, and he asked when I was going to stop being 'childish'. And that while I have every right to keep my distance from my family, I should either say I don't want to have much contact and stick to it, or push for a reconciliation. And that sending passive-aggressive and catty pictures like this was just stirring up trouble for no actual benefit, and that I should stop. I have a lot of respect for my uncle's opinions, and maybe I shouldn't keep this going. 

&#x200B;

On the other hand, my parents make me so steamed about making such a big deal over such a minor thing, and they still have never actually admitted they've done anything wrong, just that they're sorry it created a rift between us.

1c5u37m,AITA for refusing to co-parent my nieces on a vacation? ,"So my sister and I (35F) planned to take my nieces (9&11) to a major theme park and resort out of our country. We are sharing a room and planned to do the same sort of attractions each day. I love my nieces but they struggle with eating sometimes then they get really hungry and have tantrums. My sister was supposed to pack a bunch of snack options for them that they tried at home (older niece has issues with textures so it is hard to find safe foods that she will eat consistently). They also struggle to communicate how they are feeling at times. My sister has been less patient lately with them because she is extremely stressed but not really doing anything to help her mental health. I am child free by choice but I love kids and I am generally really good with them. I tend to pack a lot when I travel so I have everything I need and then some, including snacks, bandages and first aid supplies etc. my sister decided not to pack many snacks or bring them when we went out for the day to the different attractions. First day the 9y/o had a tantrum and refused to eat including lunch at the dine in restaurant my sister had booked. I stayed with older niece and we ate while my sister went outside with younger niece.  Things were rough with younger niece so they went back to the room. I stayed with older niece. Eventually they came back for a bit but by then they were both tired and I had missed out on the main attraction I wanted to do. Next day younger niece struggled again in the morning. I was able to talk to her and figure out she was really tired from all of the walking. I got one of those stroller type things for bigger kids so she could take breaks and I pushed it around most of the day. Later in the day she got overwhelmed and had to leave so my sister left and I stayed with older niece. Older niece and I went on another ride then went to a nice dinner together under our meal plan. My younger niece and sister had a nice evening at our resort. When we got back and mentioned a couple things my sister was pissed and jealous that we got a nice meal. 
Today we a lower key day but my sister let the girls stay in the pool for way too long and they refused to do their sunscreen as often as they should. I went to rest in the room. When they came back my nieces were extremely hyper and my sister was yelling at them to get going so we could go back to the nice restaurant. They left to step outside and asked me to ask them to get ready. I knew that even if they did it would be a nightmare at the restaurant and we were all hungry. When she came back and I said we should just get food here she started yelling at me about how it was so unfair that she kept having to miss things when one of the girls had a tantrum. I ended up leaving and she kept messaging me. She thinks that we should be splitting who leaves when one of them acts out. I said I am not parenting but she insists that’s what an aunt would do.

1c9387b,AITA for refusing to make pizzas for everyone at my sister’s graduation party? ,"I (M 20) have went to culinary school and have been working in professional kitchens since I was 18. Even though i’m an adult since i’m the youngest child in my family and one of the youngest relatives in general. A lot of the time it’s difficult for me to get my relatives to take me seriously or keep me in the loop about things. I attended my sister’s graduation earlier today and right after I carpool home with my mom. It isn’t until while were in the car, driving to my mom’s house for the graduation party that I was told that I was suppose to make pizza for everyone at the party. I’ve made pizza for my family before. Not because anybody asked me to purely just because I wanted to. 

The thing that is frustrating me more than anything is multiple people knew about this ahead of time but they decided to tell the person that’s actually responsible for making them last minute. On top of the fact that my family is massive. There’s most likely going to end up being 14 or 15 people at this party. If you aren’t that into cooking, you might not understand how much of a grueling process making pizza from scratch is. Between making the dough, sauce, and actually cooking them. It is a process that I need to be let know of multiple days ahead of time so I get everything ready. 

I told them that I was sick of being kept out of the loop and not treated like an adult by everyone in my family and yet everyone still relies on me constantly to cook for everyone every time there’s a family event. I told them that I will not be making pizza today and if anyone wants anything from me I won’t do it unless I am completely kept in the loop of what’s going on and told about things multiple days ahead of time. I feel bad for my sister because she was very excited to try my homemade pizza but I had to explain to her why it wasn’t going to happen and told her that I can make one for her later in the week as an extra graduation present. My parents think i’m just being petty and just not making them because I am just being lazy. I really don’t think i’m the asshole here.

1ccas2p,AITA for kicking my father out after he made “harmless” comments”? ,"My father is a typical guy for his age group. Never lifted a finger to do housework. I don’t think I can remember him doing housework in my childhood memory. My mom and him both worked and she would do all the housework and childcare. My brother and I were raised by my mom and my dad would hang out with us for 1-2h on weekends before disappearing to his man cave to watch TV. She complained to him a lot when I was a teenager and he didn’t take it seriously until she filed for divorce the second we were off to college. To this day he claims she gave him no warning and divorced him out of nowhere. 

As an adult I made sure who I dated knows how to do housework and splits it with me. We have a todo board where we list chores and who will do them and time it will take. That way we don’t do the same things and no one does too much. My father came over to visit from another state as part of work and was suppose to stay off. He was looking at the board and asked what it was and when I told him said “you realize it’s not long to last right?” I was like what? And he said it’s just natural that women want to do all the housework and take care of people and if I keep pushing it my bf will leave me. I was like WTF and told him the reason mom left was because he thought that way. 

He got defensive and said “well I make the money so she does the housework”. I pointed out she worked as well and he said “well she chose to work, it’s her own fault”. I was really pissed at that point and told him to leave. He was supposed to to stay over but I said he needs to find a place to stay but he wasn’t coming back. He left and I’m pissed he was so disrespectful. He texted later “apologizing” I got offended by his comments but they were harmless and for my best interest.
