1lghj66,AITA for telling my BIL he needs to book a hotel when he and my sister were staying at my house?,"My sister and her husband live across the country and decided they wanted to come visit. I live in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom and I set up a bed in my home office because they wanted to stay at my house. They had been here for 4 days. 

The bathroom has been a big problem. He spends hours in there. After the first day, I talked to my sister about it. She says he has a condition where he needs the bathroom a lot. So I let it rest. On day 3, it was even worse. There was a time where I had to excuse myself to go to the store so I could use the bathroom twice because he wouldn’t leave. 

The last day i woke up at 4am and had to use the bathroom very badly. I knocked on the door and he said he’d be out in a minute. I told him I really had to go. It took him an hour to get out. The nearby store wasn’t open at that time and I had to do something I am not happy I had to do because I couldn’t wait. 

The next morning I told him he needs to get a hotel. I can’t be blocked from using the bathroom in my own home because he takes it hostage. I get he has a condition, but so do I. And I make sure I have my own bathroom when I travel so I don’t get in the way of other people needing the bathroom. 

My sister and her BIL were very upset and called me ableist. I told them what I had to do last night because he was in the bathroom for so long and they said I could’ve held it. I told them they need to leave and find a hotel or stay with other family, he just can’t stay here anymore.

1l542ki,"AITA for not bringing my niece shopping after she was extremely rude/mean to me, even if she “apologized”?","I’m 26F and do not have kids, and I also have not really had a lot of experience dealing with kids before my niece. I don’t have younger siblings or cousins, I never babysat, etc. I’m explaining this because this is my blind spot and why I’m posting.

About a month ago, my niece “Gabby” and I were at the park together. I like to spend time with her and usually take her out to do things just the two of us every couple of weeks. While we were at the park, I was talking about an event I am going to attend with my boyfriend of a few years. She asked to see my dress, so I showed her a pic of me in it.

She made a “yucky” face and said “That’s soooooooo ugly. You look really fat. Isn’t \[\[my boyfriend\]\] gonna think it's bad?”

I was so hurt. She’s only 13! I’m not even a big girl in any sense. I have fat on my body, but I am definitely not fat. 

My sister was surprised and said she would talk to her. A few days later she had Gabby come over to apologize. From my POV, it was not sincere. She was rolling her eyes and looked angry and just got out the words. I told her thank you for apologizing and then told them to leave. I have not gone out my way to spend time with her since.

I had told Gabby that I would take her shopping for the summer and we’d pick out fun stuff together. I look forward to doing things like this with her. Not really anymore. When we were at my mom’s house for mother’s day, Gabby asked me when we would go.

After her stunt I’ve changed my mind. I said that she probably has plenty of summer clothes to wear. She was upset and said “But I said I was sorry!” over and over. 

I told her that I know she said she was sorry but just because someone says they’re sorry to you doesn’t mean that your actions are forgiven. That you have to prove to the other person you won’t do it again, and she hasn’t. 

My mom and sister say I’m expecting adult behavior from a child and that it was ridiculous to cancel the shopping date. I am apparently beefing with a child at my big age. They said that she apologized and hasn’t said anything else rude to me since. They asked how long I’m going to hold it against her. 

I really don’t know how to take this. I trust their judgment most of the time. But this was just an outright mean thing from her. I am worried that as she grows up this behavior will continue and she will turn out to be a bully.

1lkjvjf,AITA for asking why they ignored the no dog sign.,"I (33M) went to a coffee shop this past weekend. As soon as I open the door I'm hit with a dog looking at me at hip level sitting on a chari n this small shop.  The dog is indoors and the door had a clear no pets sign.  I watched for a second, this clearly wasn't a service animal as she was letting it interact with several other guests.   

I asked her why she ignored the no pets sign?  She ignores me.  I asked her did you miss the no pets sign?  She immediately says I think you should stop harassing me.   All I was doing was asking why she ignored the no pets sign.  This lady played the victim and called me an asshole.   

Another patron steps up for her and the dude says why's it an issue? Who cares?   Tells me don't be an asshole and drop it. I wave the guy off, tell him I care, and I don't like dogs.  I say it's not hard to not bring your dog to a coffee shop that doesn't allow dogs.  By that point it's my time to order, I complained to the employee who didn't seem interested in enforcing anything. The owner left on her own.  AITA?

1ld6790,AITA for telling my DIL that I will never be her mother and to leave me alone,"This is mostly about my daughter-in-law (Kat). Her mother ran out on her when she was a child, and she went into foster care. According to my son, she’s currently seeing a therapist.

My issue with Kat is that she has repeatedly stomped on my boundaries. She’s a very touchy person, she  refuses to call me by my name and only refers to me as “Mom.” I correct her every time since I’m not comfortable being called “Mom” by her, and I want her to use my name.

There have been multiple times where she’s asked inappropriate questions, mostly about why I’m not close to my own mother. (For context, my mother was horrible) Kat keeps pushing for details and insists I should get closer to her because “family sticks together.” She basically tells me to forgive my mom, and she doesn’t understand not being close with one’s parents. I’ve told her to drop the topic multiple times, and she refuses. Because of all this, I’m not a huge fan of hers.

I’ve spoken to my son about it, and he asked me to be patient. I’ve also talked to Kat multiple times and asked her to respect my boundaries. She always says she will, but then goes right back to ignoring them.

This is where I might be the jerk: My daughter Sam (20) and I are taking a weekend trip. Sam has medical issue and needs to see a specialist a few states over. She hasn’t disclosed the issue to the rest of the family yet (she plans to when she has a firm plan).

Somehow, word about the trip got back to Kat, and she called me asking why she wasn’t invited. I told her it’s an important trip and not a fun one. She accused me of lying, claiming it was a “mother-daughter” trip that she was excluded from. I told her again this is not a girls’ trip. She wouldn’t let it go and started demanding that she come, saying that she’s my daughter and needs to be there. I said no again. She kept insisting, saying I am her “mom”and she has to come on this trip since is my kid. That’s when I snapped. I told her I will never be her mother. Just because she married my son does not make me her parent. I told her to leave me the fuck alone and that even if this was a mother-daughter trip, she still wouldn’t be invited, because she isn’t my kid. I then hung up. 

My son says I need to apologize and invite her. That I am a huge dick to her. That I was way out of line and need to make it up to Kat. The situation has spread to the rest of the family, and everyone seems to have their own opinion. Sam is getting flack too, which isn’t helping especially since she doesn’t want to disclose the reason for the trip yet.

Am I being an asshole and need to apologize even tho those are my true feelings on her trying to make me her parent.",Slow_throwaway_8233,8844,0.9300000071525574,1081,1750111521,2025-06-16 17:05:21,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ld6790/aita_for_telling_my_dil_that_i_will_never_be_her/,6,2025
1llepvm,AITA for telling a woman to keep her comments to herself in an elevator?,"This happened earlier today. I was waiting for the elevator in my office building. The doors opened, no one was directly in front of me, so I stepped in. A woman and an elderly couple were just behind me, but I hadn’t seen or heard them until after I got on.

As soon as I stepped in, the woman complained out loud that I didn’t let her on first. I was caught off guard, but I apologized and said there was plenty of room for everyone, so it wasn’t a big deal. I wasn’t trying to cut anyone off; I genuinely didn’t notice anyone behind me.

She got on with the couple but kept going, saying how rude I was, how I had no manners, how people like me are what’s wrong these days, stuff like that. This went on for at least a minute, maybe more, and eventually I snapped a bit. I raised my voice and said Could you just keep your comments to yourself.

She went quiet, but the old couple sort of whispered something to her and gave me a look. Now I’m wondering if I just confirmed whatever idea they had about me, like maybe I actually was the jerk here.

I honestly didn’t mean to offend anyone. I just wanted to ride the elevator in peace.

So, AITA for finally telling her to be quiet?",BakingWaking,8282,0.9599999785423279,755,1750979765,2025-06-26 18:16:05,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1llepvm/aita_for_telling_a_woman_to_keep_her_comments_to/,6,2025
1l0zqm2,AITA for not leaving apartment for a week,"My girlfriend just lost someone close to her and is grieving. She asked me if I’d be willing leave the apartment so she can alone for the week.

1lh9z5y,AITA for ordering fries instead?,"This is one that's been haunting me intermittently for the majority of my life. I've been called an asshole several times over this, and finally decided to poll a larger group about it.

Where I live, there's a local mom and pop drive in restaurant that's been open and family run for about 70 years now. They open every spring and stay open until October. They sell north American classics - burgers, hot dogs, onion rings, French fries, and a variety of different ice cream cones, sundaes and milkshakes. I'm 30 and have been going there all my life. The food is always great.

Here's my apparent crime: when I and a group of my friends or family or inlaws all pile in the car and go to the drive-in, they all tend to order some kind of cold sweet treat. Shakes and cones, etc. But I am a) lactose intolerant and b) a fiend for french fries. So 9 times out of 10, I go against the grain and order fries instead of any ice cream. In the spirit of full disclosure I WILL say that I am 100% one of those lactose intolerant people who ignores it and takes the L to eat dairy when it suits me. I just prefer the fries, or maybe sometimes a hotdog, over ice cream.

The cooked food and the frozen desserts get served up out of two different windows with two different lines, and the ice cream line definitely moves faster. 

So for about 20 years now, I've been getting intermittently complained at and criticized for ordering fries when everyone else ordered icecream, and therefore holding up the entire group for an extra 5 to 10 minutes to get my food, so we can all leave. It's apparently very inconsiderate of me to order something that takes longer than everyone else, when the whole rest of the group ordered from the quicker options. They're all getting what they want, they're not settling. It's just apparently rude of me to also get what I want. 

It's been several different friends, family members and inlaws now who've said this, ranging from 'playful jokes' to downright cranky bitching. Is it actually so bad of me to order something that takes 5 to 10 minutes more? It's not like I ask them to wait to eat, or anything.

1ld8i4o,AITA for making my 14 year old fend for himself ?,"My son is 14. Up until the last several months I’ve done everything for him. Never made him lift a finger.

Then my husband and I had a miracle baby.

After I brought her home it became clear that I was not the spring chicken I once was and I was going to need some help. 

I started making my son do his own laundry. 
If he asked me if something was clean I asked him whether or not he washed it.

I bag up the trash and put it beside the can and tell him to take it out. 
( before I was ALWAYS the one taking it out )

I don’t go in his room and pick up , vacuum or make sure he doesn’t have a bunch of fast food wrappers , snack wrappers on the floor.
I just leave them there.

My husband thinks I’m being too harsh , he’s just a kid and to cut him some slack.

I grew up with siblings and we had an actual chore list but my husband disagrees and is holding that I had a rougher and more difficult Childhood and to not enforce that on him.

AITA help ?

1l6o14h,"AITAH telling Sil my kids will follow my rules on vacation not her ""rules""","So my family me f38 hubby m38 son 12 and daughter 10 will be joining husband's family on vacation. (His mom/dad, his sister/bil and his brother/wife/ 3 kids f/f/m). We have vacationed with this group before and it goes well except for my sil. She is a narcissist and expects me to follow her rules with my kids so her kids don't melt down. Like no snacking 2 hrs or less before a meal. Only water with meals. Stuff like that.  Her middle daughter has ODD and her son has ADHD. And tend to melt down often. So now on to the situation. We were at the in-laws discussing dinner for the week as each group will take a night to purchase and prepare dinner for everyone. My kids are not picky eaters, but obviously have things they don't like. Both my kids hate potatoes. (Only eat French fries) Sil reminded us that her one daughter has a severe peanut allergy and mild seafood allergy. My 12yr old said awe man I forgot about that. I wanted fish tacos for dinner. (We are going were seafood is amazing) hearing this sil raised her voice at my son and said...""yeah lets have fish tacos so my daughter dies"" ""great idea"" my in-laws and I  snapped back saying that was not what he meant. He was not demanding we have fish. So I'm already irritated with her. When she announces she will make chili my heart drops. My sil puts cubed potatoes in her chili. My husband says to my son. Guess you won't be eating chili that night your Aunt puts potatoes in her chili. Sil loses it and says to my son well that's how I make it so deal with it. My son says ok I'll just have a sandwich that night. Sil says no you won't. You eat what's served or don't eat anything that's the rule. I say no it's not the rule and he most definitely can eat a sandwich that night.  Sil replies absolutely not. My kids eat what is served or they don't eat. If your kids start that carp then my kids will expect the same treatment so your kids need to follow the rules. I said my kids will follow my rules and my rule is son can have a sandwich instead of chili end of story. Sil starts to say something and my father in law says everyone quiet!! I paid for this trip so if anyone has a say in rules it's me...my rules. So my rule right now is drop the dinner disagreement  and move on. The rest of the night went OK. However when leaving my husband's brother told him I over stepped and we all know how his kids get if they are set off so  just make your son eat the damn chili. He can pick out the potatoes. On the way home we decided we will skip family dinner that night and go out to eat.  Hubby called his dad and told him our plan. His dad said that's fine. This is a family vacation, but everyone is allowed to do as they want with their families.

1l53pxa,AITA for saying no no to my friend for the art  they gave me,"So about 10 months ago, my friend gave me three little artwork pieces that they thought were really ugly and they hated. I absolutely adore them and I think they’re very pretty so I have them in my living room and so I redecorated my living room and rearranged everything so I could have these paintings in a very specific spot.

One day they were over and one of my friends that they have yet to meet until that day was over as well . My other friend who did not give me the artwork looked up the art pieces through Google lens because they also liked them and wanted to get some for themselves. 

That friend found out that the artwork that was given to me was worth $1000 per piece . And I said wow, that’s an insane price. So the friend who gave me the art pieces told me that I needed to give them back to him. And he started taking him off the wall and I said absolutely not. You gave those to me. 

He started yelling at me because I wouldn’t give them back. Then he said I better pay him $3000 for all of them and I said no because you gifted them to me almost a year ago. 

So he told me that he was gonna call the police and he left because me and my other friend kicked him out.

1l4blmf,WIBTA if I turned down my ex's settlement offer and forced him out of his home?,"I (F, 32) am divorced from my ex (M, 38). During the divorce process, he agreed to pay me 250K for my share of our house. The court gave him until June of last year to pay me the full amount. He paid me 210K and said he would get me the rest as soon as he was able. (We both put 100k down when we were married to get the house in the first place). He signed a legally binding divorce agreement. I last spoke to him in December about when I could expect the rest of my money. He told me he didn't know. He did say that he wanted me to come pick up the rest of my stuff I had in the old storage shed. I told I could get it when I got back into town after the holidays and he told me no, get it before Jan 1. I canceled my trip home to see my family just for him to take a hammer to everything and leave it in the street Christmas morning. That's when I went to my lawyer and filed contempt charges. He was already in violation of the agreement but now im suing for interest, legal and damages. His lawyer has approached mine with a settlement offer. Everything im asking for, paid in six months. He will return some things he chose to keep rather than smash. If I decline, he will have 30 days to sell the house. I don't want to make a decision in anger. He loves that house and wants to die there. I don't need to force the timeline for the money but he has dragged this process out for years (being a no show to court, ducking service, refusing to sign the papers, requesting continuances for hearings etc). Maybe he will pay me in six months and he can still keep the house but part of me wants him to finally suffer the consequences of blowing off his legal responsibilities.

1lm5b47,"AITA for telling my daughter she needs to grow up, and apolgize to her sister","My late husband died when my oldest daughter (Sofia) was 9 and my youngest daughter (Julie) was 2. Julie has zero memories of her biological dad. I started to date 4 years after his death and remarried 7 years later (Sofia was 16 and Julie was 9). Sofia wanted nothing to do with him and looking back was a dick to him. My husband (Jim) never tried to force Sofia to see him as a father figure, but Julie did see him as a father figure. She refers to him as Dad. Both girls have been to therapy, Sofia hated it and I actaully think it made the issue below worse. Julie like it and helped her overcome never knowing bio dad.

That was the main issue between Sofia and Julie, Sofia thought julie was abandoning and replaying their bio-dad.  Julie made it very clear that Jim is her dad and basically bio-dad doesn’t mean much to her since, she doesn’t remember him. Many fights and their relationship was strained. Therapy didnt help, separate and group were tried. 

It got better when Sofia went off to college and they had space. Julie (24) is getting married. She announced this during dinner last Saturday and asked for Jim to give her away. Sofia did not take that well and started telling Julie that she was a horrible daughter and that she is replacing dad.

The announcement was ruined and Julie told her not to come to the wedding. I pulled Sofia aside and told her that she needs to apologize to her sister for her outburst, that she is way too old for this and it is time for her to grow the fuck up. That is fine that she doesn’t see jim as her father but get over that her sister does. 

She was crying when I finished, told me it is my fault for getting remarried in the first place and had not contacted me since. I know she apologized to Julie but she won’t respond to any of my texts.

1l6pxot,AITAH? I don’t want my husband coming on a family cruise,"I (50f) have been with my (52m) husband for 24 years. Over the past few years, he’s aged in dog years. My fun-loving, energetic happy husband has become someone who only sits and stares at the wall. When he’s not doing that, he’s sleeping. Without interference, he would sleep for 20 hours out of every 24. He’s been like this for 4 years now, has seen 20 doctors and takes three pills for each one he saw. 
In January, he broke a bone in his foot walking up the stairs because he developed a heel wound and didn’t tell anyone. Bone infection = weak bones. Since then, he’s been hospitalized three times, had two surgeries (currently has a large external fixator on his right ankle/leg that resembles like a metal halo) and two more planned. I have to give him IV antibiotics twice a day through his PICC line(second round of 6 weeks) as he can’t see well enough to do it himself. He gets daily wound care to his heel from visiting nurses that I have to do 4 days a week because they will only come three times a week. Plus, I have to change it every time the dressing falls off which is another 2-3 times a week. As you can imagine, he cannot work which forces me to carry every burden we have. I have had to work more hours to support the entire family. I have to clean our house, cook every meal, pay the bills, food shop, car maintenance, arrange and go to medical appointments. I just had to fix the garbage disposal that my husband dropped a fork into and our youngest’s scooter got a flat . . . Oh, did I mention we have two daughters, 21 & 12? We do or rather, I do. If someone is awake but spaced out only 4 hours a day, can you really call them a parent?
A year ago, we booked a cruise for the family. A week in the Caribbean, water parks, snorkeling, sight-seeing, shows, food, you name it. We have all been looking forward to it but I am desperate to go. I’m mentally and physically exhausted. I need a vacation, a break. I’m being pulled in every direction 24/7. 
We learned two days ago that the large metal apparatus in his foot is not coming off anytime soon. Plus, the wound is healing incredibly slow. My husband and I talked about the cruise. It’s in a month. He says he is going. I told him that I didn’t think he should. I told him I needed a break. That he can’t do anything once we are there (he can’t swim or submerge the leg with the fracture). That he isn’t supposed to be up and around as he’s ordered to be non-weight bearing on the one leg. I told him it would be completely unfair to me and the girls as I would be forced to nurse him and push him everywhere in a wheelchair while our daughters would feel guilty about leaving him behind and going anywhere. How is that fun? I explained all that and more. He says he’s going. He will just sit in the casino with all the money he doesn’t have. I told him ‘no’. He’s mad and sulking. So, AITAH? I don’t want him going.",50isnotthenew90,4964,0.8700000047683716,2054,1749424956,2025-06-08 18:22:36,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l6pxot/aitah_i_dont_want_my_husband_coming_on_a_family/,6,2025
1l2r4cg,AITA for giving my wife a dirty plate to eat off of at dinner,"My wife is a nurse, and she works long hours; therefore, I handle everything in the household.She has been picking up more shifts recently because the hospital is understaffed. I am the one doing the chores, taking care of the kids, making food, and I also work.  It's all me. She has one chore, and that is when she comes home, she needs to do the dishes

The kids are usually asleep by the time she gets home, so I usually make dinner for the kids and wait until she gets home to reheat the food for her. The main issue is that she has not been cleaning the dishes. I have talked to her multiple times, but nothing has changed. She gets home, eats, and goes right to bed. She always claims she is too tired after her shift to do the dishes, and when I suggest she does them in the morning, she claims there is not enough time before she needs to get to work.

It is extremely frustrating to wake up and they are not done, that leads to me having to do the dishes at some point. We talking about this agin last Saturday and she has not done the dishes since (four days of not doing them) and I have not done them either. I have ran out of dishes and served dinner to the kids on paper plates tongiht. She got home after the kids were asleep and I handed her a dirty plate to eat off of. 

I told her that she can use that to reheat the food. We was not happy and we got into an agrument. She called me a dick for handing her a dirty plate to eat off of and that I was home so I would have cleaned some dishes. I pointed out that this is her job and I am not going it. That if she wont clean the dishes than she can eat off a dirty plate. She is calling me a jerk, I told my sister of the situation and she said I am being petty.

1laurb1,AITA for telling my girlfriend that her using her accent in public alienates people from her?,"AITA for telling my girlfriend that her using her accent in public alienates people from her? 

So, my (27M) girlfriend (26F) and I are huge movie buffs; we are cinephiles and that's actually how we first met, through Letterboxd. We watch a lot of classic movies together, from the 30's and the 40's. (Sidenote: People, do not be afraid to watch old black-and-white films, please. Some of them can feel just as funny and affecting as new films). 

Now, on to the real problem. My GF's a huge fan of Katharine Hepburn, and insists on watching at least one of her movies every other day. However, recently, she's started imitating her speech patterns and mannerisms. 

For anyone who's interested, Katharine Hepburn didn't speak in an organic American or British accent. It was a weird mix of the two, called the Transatlantic accent. [This](https://youtube.com/shorts/UgrL-8RRyJE?si=fMvFetACdqb57ypQ) is what it sounds like. It isn't an organic or natural accent, but rather one that was taught to upper-class children and media personalities back in the day. 

My GF has exclusively started to use this accent in public, and with me, and it's weirding people out, and giving off a sense of entitlement. What makes it worse is that we're actually a bit more financially secure compared to our friends, which makes her seem bragging and shameless in front of them. I've tried to tell her, but she just ignores me.

1liua1b,AITA for having fun at a beach while my friends waited in a Wendy's for 3 hours?,"Context: Me and 6 other friends went on a beach trip. The plan was to spend 2 days. We had booked a hotel for one night($1222) for which our friend said we could pay him back later. I paid for a rental van which we took there($571) which I also said everyone could pay us back later. 

The first day everyone went to the beach and was satisfied. The second day, 4 people in the group were not trying to go on the sand. Instead, they wanted to walk around the city around the beach. (For context this is Virginia Beach). Me, and 2 other people in the group wanted to go in the water. We brought the keys to the rental van with us since we were the only ones with licenses. We had planned to leave the beach by 7pm so 2 people in the non-beach going group could go to work the next day, while allowing us to fulfill our rental van dropoff for 2:30AM

While me and my 2 friends were in the water, the non-beach going group called us 5 times claiming that they wanted to leave early.(It was 4:57) and we didn't see the calls until we got out at 5:43. They said they were so exhausted that they sat and waited in a Wendy's for 3 hours. Me and the beach-going friends still wanted to get food. So we got the food and then we went to pick them up and go back home(This was 7 on the dot). My friend is giving me the silent treatment.

1lns0j2,AITA for only paying for my pregnant sisters meals when I can verify them?,"My (30f) sister (24f) became pregnant with her first child this year. I'm very excited to be an aunt, but I have had to balance that excitement with difficult emotional choices about how much financial support to offer. 
My sister has lead a chaotic life in her teens to now, and frequently changes friends, where she lives, her phone number, etc. While I would love to be close to her, it can feel like walking into a hurricane. 
Now that she is pregnant without much income, I feel very guilty to turn down her frequent requests for money. However, when I do give her money, I try to go about it in a way where I can tell that the money is going to food and not something else. 
My sister doesn't do drugs, but the father of her child and on-off boyfriend has served time for federal drug charges for using and selling cocaine and heroin/fentanyl. I worry that the money I give her may end up going to something completly unintentional on my part due to his influence. 
Typically, when she asks for money, (often to order food) I ask if I can put the order in through the restaurant myself or see the DoorDash order. Usually this results in her asking other people for money instead. 
Am I being too hard on her during a rough period in her life? I want to support her, but not in a way that could hurt her later.

1lleol5,AITA for hiding my pregnancy from my sister?,"I (28F) am over 3 months along, and I'm worried if I tell my sister (21F) that shes going to try to get pregnant too... again.

Two years ago I had my first pregnancy. I announced it to my family at dinner and everyone was very happy and supportive of me. Ive been with my bf (34M) for 5 years now and it seemed like everything was falling into place for our midwest life. But my sister is a narcissist, and saw how happy and excited everyone was for me and decided she wanted that for herself. She made it her mission to also get pregnant, while in college, with no job or place of her own. She got pregnant within the next 2 months while at school and expected everyone to also be excited. Obviously she got a different reaction and was really mad at everyone for not just accepting her irresponsible choice. She ended up dropping out. 

Fast foward to my emergency c-section where we fought to keep my baby alive in the NICU, only to pass away at 9 days. I don't want to get into the details of it,  but obviously it was traumatic. And my sisters world completely changed from thinking we would be raising kids together. Her baby was born on time and healthy. And I hate to say but shes a terrible mother. She doesnt prioritize her child at all, doesn't even capture milestones or spend quality time with him, just dumps him on a family member for a few days so she can go out. To each their own but its extremely infuriating, considering how motherhood was ripped away from me and she doesnt have a maternal bone in her body. 

Now 2 years later, shes still in the same spot. No job, living with her mom, doesnt prioritize her child and didnt go back to school. He isnt speaking words and just grunting and is developmentally delayed. I see this and it makes me realize she didnt really want a kid, she just wanted that unconditional support from our family that they showed me. So now that im pregnant again, I really dont want to tell her. And my family has agreed with me not to tell her. I'm worried shes going to see that as an opportunity to get pregnant again because shes obsessed with attention whether its negative or positive, and can't stand the spotlight on me. But i feel bad the further along I get, and the more people I tell, shes going to be extremely upset when she finds out. And if you know narcissistic rage, then you understand.  I figured maybe I'd tell her this weekend finally, BUT she just posted on her story ""going crazy this summer bc i'm manifesting a babygirl next year."" Like HUH? You cannot keep a job, you dont even help your mom with rent and you want to have a 2nd kid already? For WHAT? You aren't even a good mother to your first! The father wants to take him for custody! Makes me want to shake her by the shoulders ugh. Now I know when I tell her shes definitely going to try it again. 
I rarely see her and we arent technically that close, so I could hide this for as long as I wanted tbh. AITA? or are my fears valid? 

Edit: I understand the concern for my nephew. My family is all for the father getting custody, my sister is the only one against it. We all see her for who she is, but she doesn't seen anything wrong with her actions.Hes only 2 right now. She doesn't think shes a bad mom. He and my sister both live with her mom, my step mom, who is a school teacher. She does as much as she can to help him while also still trying to maintain her own life, but she doesn't want the entire responsibility of raising a child and I'm sure thats understandable.

1l1u1e9,AITA for feeding my dogs before my stepsister?,"I (18F) live with my dad, his wife “Jackie”, and my stepsister Mia (13F). My dad was paralyzed from the chest down in a car crash in a car crash 5 years ago. Jackie and Mia moved in 4 years ago. We’re a very happy blended family. 

The only issue that I have is that Mia is kinda spoiled. She pretty much gets whatever she wants whenever. She’s usually a very sweet kid overall which is why I’m questioning if I’m being an asshole. Jackie left on a business trip last night. Before she left, I told her that I would handle making dinner, bringing Mia home from track practice, and general tidiness of the house. I would also continue to take care of my two very large Great Danes that I was given my grandmother. My family plays with and snuggles them, but they are my dogs. 

Mia’s chores were the dishes after dinner, bringing her dirty clothes to the laundry room door, and taking the trash out. It all seemed fine when Jackie left. 

Well I went to pick Mia up from track this afternoon and when she got into the car she asked for her snack. I said we had food at home, but I didn’t bring any. She said her mom always brought a snack for her and kinda pouted. 

When we got home, she stayed in my car when I went inside. I left with my dogs before she came in. When I returned, she was crying at the kitchen table. I asked why and she said that I hadn’t prepared a snack for her and she was so hungry. I told her she always had access to our pantry. She said it wasn’t the same because it’s always already ready for her. 

I went to feed the dogs and she asked where I was going. I told her and she started to scream cry at me that I was heartless and only cared for my “stupid animals” and that I needed to make dinner right that second. She then ran upstairs and slammed the door. 

I called Jackie and told her what happened. She was confused because Mia knows she’s always welcome to food. I know she’s adjusting to her mom being away.

1lfnln7,"AITA for refusing to be an unpaid maid for my BFF? Am I wrong for telling her her expectations should be that her husband cleans THEIR house? Am I wrong for saying she should be grateful for the help I'm offering, not expect more?","
*Update at the bottom* I was planning to fly over and help my BFF kick labour into action the two weeks running up to her due date. I had planned to help out with the school run of her two other kids, take my bff on long walks and catch up on some good old British TV all day whilst they were at school.

At her hospital appointment on Monday she found out she needs to have the baby via C section, two weeks early. So about 24-48hrs after i get through her door. 

She called me all apologetic, I said yeah not ideal, there would be no TV anymore but I can at least help my bff with er two oldest whom I love. She  said yeah "" you'd need to have main responsibility for the household cleaning, dishes, cooking, hoovering etc""

I said nah, I can do a meal or two, wash up after a meal or two but I'm not cleaning your bathroom or your kitchen on my holiday with my own home I could clean when your husband is also there. (Two weeks paternity leave)

She got very upset with me, said that my pride is in the way of helping her, that I'm not willing to support both her and her husband. Said her expectations of me were to clean and look after the kids, and her expectations of her husband was to bond with the new one and IF he had time/energy for him to help me a bit with the housework, and if I wasn't willing to do that she'd refund my flight ticket.

Am I the arsehole or what? Is this normal expectation, should I still go and be the BFF she needs? Am I wrong for feeling like her expectations should be that her husband cleans THEIR house? Am I wrong for thinking she should be grateful for the help I'm offering, not expect more from me than her husband whom she CHOSE to have three children with?

EDIT: I am English,when I use the word ""holiday"" it  does not mean beach and hotel, it means the period of time when you are not at work, normally 4-6 weeks paid leave a year. Mine are usually used to help/visit my best friend. 

I paid for the tickets (like I usually do) hence the word refund

My flight is 2nd July. The original due date 19th July. My flight back 21st July.

I visited (hopefully visit doesn't mean the equivalent of holiday) three weeks before the previous child successfully. Best friend of over a decade, played at their wedding, given (and happily taken) title auntie by their first. 

Help with the two children under ten - so that they got time to just focus on the new one. So that includes everything a child must do throughout the day, bedtime, food, homework, take them to activities, iron school uniform, pack and make lunches...those that know know.

I'd normally clean during the adverts, it's the expectation that is getting me turned upside down. And the fact there's no more TV time. 😅

Update:
So I realise it is a split decision. Those that mean to say im the AH would happily take because they seem i am in a position to give (mother Theresa it) , and those that say i am NAH are identifying that having the ability doesn't mean to say I must (rich staying rich).
Morally I don't deem it appropriate to expect something you'll never be able to give yourself. My best friend would love to be able to think she'd one day be able to do this for me, hence why she thinks it's appropriate to expect, however she will never be able given the amount of dependables she has.

The majority of the AH comments wanted me to give give give as much as I can cause she needs needs needs. I won't stop trying to give to better my friends situation, but it's just like when a charity cause is asking for money, you don't empty your bank in donations, you give what your comfortable with that month, and should not be subjected to ""oh so little"" or ""we need donations of x and up"". 

The majority of the NAH comments meant it was appropriate to ensure self perseverance and demonstrate boundaries. It's true, even though we speak 24/7 her life isn't mine, and therefore any requests to put mine in a deeply compromised position to save her family from a choice the made knowingly is unfair. I love my best friend but, I don't feel comfortable being that selfless, not when I don't deem it necessary. If she was suddenly single mother no questions or demands needed, I'd step up, however she isn't. It took two to tango, they made three tangos, i shouldnt have to turn maid. They shouldnt expect more from me because I don't yet have children, your choice to have children shouldn't be my cross to bear.

How we're doing:
We're still maintaining our snap streak. A good long-term friendship has ups and downs, disagreement and union. Both parties are hurt but still care for one another, however this is her time to nest and get ready to be a family of five. For me, I got the time back  to focus on what I initially had planned for my first summer after purchasing a house. There is a mutual agreement that this time around I'm not going, and she has refunded the cost of the tickets. she will have her mom come as planned, they wear very easily of her ""help"" and often cut her trip shorter. I am the preferred help. But I feel when you want someone to slave about, you should be able to tolerate their personality. Cause at the end of the day, it wasn't her choice to have three children or her choice of ""partner"" for her daughter. Only a PAID cleaner can you expect a lack of (voiced) opinion cause they are paid to do the job and keep their opinion to themselves.

Side note: I hope someone high up in the educational department in the US fixes the comprehension levels expectations before one gets a GED /graduates highschool. It's been enlightening, I thought I was 100% correct but I wasn't. Thank you all for your comments and advice.

1l5xyih,AITA for not letting my neighbor take my children swimming?,"I have 3 children between ages 3-8. Today my husband was supposed to take them to the park but he procrastinated and now it's too late because he has to leave out to an event. Our sweet next door neighbor ended up messaging us to see if the kids could join her child at the pool (our children enjoy playing together). My husband thinks this is a great idea since they were excited to go to the park but are no longer going. He told the children about this exiting new option to go swimming instead before bringing it to me. But I said no. I am 40 weeks pregnant, exhausted and it's much too hot for ME to go and sit at the pool w/ my children right now (which is why dad was supposed to do the park w/ them). I am sure my neighbor would not mind me sending them out by themselves because again she is so kind and sweet and I don't think for one second that they will be unsafe with her. Sending THREE children w/ this lady to the pool all by herself on top of her own child is selfish in my opinion. I would also be the parent dealing with the aftermath of swimming like hair and baths etc. My husband thinks it's not fair to the kids because they now have to ""be stuck in the house all day with nothing to do"". They have plenty of toys, board games and a whole backyard to play in, as well as each other. They will be fine and again, had he moved faster then they would have been able to stick to the original plan and been back from the park by now. In his opinion there is no difference in sending them to the pool without me since I wasn't going to be joining them at the park.

1l2nzr3,AITA for refusing to open my pool w/o a safety gate?,"This has been a matter of contention for three years between myself (F36) and partner (M47). He inherited his family home 3 years ago, which includes a large 20x40 foot pool with a 10’ deep end. The sliding glass door in the kitchen opens directly onto the pool area. For context, we have two kids together, age 5 & 3, and I brought three of my own into the relationship, 11, 12 & 17. 

Since we moved in, I have said the pool needs to be fenced in. The back yard itself is fenced in, so home owners insurance grants a policy. But there is no gate/fence/anything between the house and the pool. The slider also grants access to our detached garage, which holds his office, and my oldest son’s work shop. So the slider is utilized multiple times daily. Years one and two, I got child safe sliding door locks and alarms, trying to force everyone to go out the front door and around the house to access the garage. It didn’t work. Partner would still utilize the sliding door. Older kids would go out that door to access the garage. Even forcing everyone out the front door isn’t a fool safe because a younger kid can still run around the house, through the garage, or gate. 

Drownings happen fast. I get told “just watch them”. Yes, obviously. Youngest two are also in year two of swim lessons. I don’t feel comfortable without a gated pool, bottom line.

Here is my AITA? question. This summer, I’m refusing to open the pool until a six foot fence with a locking gate is installed around the entire pool. My older kids are giving me grief that I’m ruining their summer. Partner has said he doesn’t have time to install a fence, but won’t hire anyone because no one can do anything as good as he can. #sarcasm. Family is upset they can’t come swim.

1ljpmdq,AITA for kicking my brother out after he insulted my wife?,"(Hi reddit made this account to get some insight into a situation)  
  
I (32M) have a younger brother (27M) who’s been staying at my house for the past month. He’s between apartments, and I offered our guest room to help him out. My wife Kara(30F) and I have been happy to have him until last weekend.

We were all watching TV and having a normal chat when my brother suddenly made a really nasty comment about Kara. For context, Kara recently switched careers (to something that makes her much happier) and is earning less right now. My brother joked “Haha, youre basically living off my brother, right? What a gold digger.” I immediately told him off. Kara looked shocked and hurt. She told him that was a rude and wrong. Instead of apologizing, my brother doubled down. He said something along the lines of “Well, I call it like I see it. Maybe if you weren’t so lazy and got a better job, you wouldn’t have to mooch off my brother.”  

At that point I got a little mad. I told him to get out of my house if he was going to disrespect my wife under our own roof. He scoffed and said I was “overreacting to a joke.” It didn’t feel like a joke to either of us. Kara was quietly tearing up at this point. I was furious and told him to pack his stuff right now. We got into a shouting match. 

Now a few days later, my parents are upset that I kicked him out and he has nowhere to go. They admit what he said was wrong, but they think I should have been the bigger person and just talked it out the next day rather than throwing him out immediately. I personally feel I did the right thing standing up for Kara. he is an adult and should deal with this stuff himself. 

My brother hasn’t apologized at all. He’s texted me basically blaming Kara for being sensitive. That makes me even angrier. However, a part of me wonders if I moved too quickly by kicking him out on the spot. 

My wife, for her part, thanked me for defending her and says I did the right thing. My parents say family is family and I should let him come back and just set some rules. I don’t want him back unless he genuinely apologizes, which doesn’t seem likely right now.

So, Reddit, AITA for kicking my brother out after he insulted my wife?   
(My parents live in state funded housing and aren't allowed more people)

Edit: after some talking people in the comments (and someone in my DMs who showed me how to edit this post) I think I might rent him his own studio apartment in a  lower income neighborhood that I can afford. BUT only if Kara agrees and he genuinely apologizes to both of us. I love him and care too much about him to see him go homeless.

1lm814y,AITA: For telling my boyfriend no to an invitation to an all-inclusive resort (getting engaged) because his mom will be there.,"Myself (25 F) and my boyfriend (27 M) have been in a relationship for eight years. We have been planning to get engaged for the past year and the ring just arrived in the mail. Yes, we picked it out together, but the plan is that he would execute the actual proposal. He always said the proposal would be small and didn't want anything extravagant or in public, which I agreed to. Before we began picking out rings or ordering the ring, we were talking about going on a vacation with his mom. 

This vacation would be the first for him and his mom and they want it to be international. I was in agreement with this, as there are no issues between myself and his mom and they are really close. By close, I mean a pattern of her word before mine, him agreeing to her wishes, my opinion being put on the backburner. Yes, a momma's boy, but this is not the issue at hand, as I love them both and accept this about them. This just helps with the context of the situation. We all went together to get our passports and are now planning on going to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico. 

As far as I was concerned, I thought the proposal would happen sometime before or after this vacation. Today he mentioned wanting to propose while we're on vacation with his mom and I feel that this would:

 1. Make it so that we are unable to enjoy a romantic time together while his mom is present. 

2. Cause it to be uncomfortable for her as we may not spend as much time with her since we'll be celebrating.

3. Her praise for her son may overshadow our celebration and divide his attention.

I was very clear about not wanting his mom to be there, and he said that there would be no other way that he would want to propose because he wants it to be somewhere extravagant and away from where we live. His idea is that for the most part, she would be doing her own thing while we spend time together. I brought up the fact that if she wanted to do something without him, she would be going on vacations on her own. I also mentioned that my expectations are not that we need to be doing something special and if he was open to it, to get engaged before and keep the vacation separate/make it part of the celebration. He was not open to this idea either, so I offered to not go to save money for the trip, and plan something different for us, and now he's upset.

I really just want this to be a special moment between the two of us that we can share with our friends and family after the fact. His mom being there just makes it seem like I'm taking away time with her son from her or she's going to be taking away the joy of my engagement celebration.

1ljon7k,AITA for yelling at my aunt when she decorated my books for school?,"I know, the title sounds bitchy. I (14F) go to summer school because I did very poorly in my classes last year. This summer, I have tried to take the initiative to change. I bought 10 compositions notebooks and started researching study methods so I can perform more efficiently. Now, back to the summer school thing, my mum works long hours at her place of work, so my aunt (her sister) is the one to pick me up. 


A few days ago, I had brought to my aunts one of my books so I could study and take notes while at her house. I had a few stickers on there, maybe 2-3. After studying, I left the book on her dining table and took a nap on the couch. While I was laying down, she started looking at the notebook and kept saying things like “Oh its so lovely, I have the perfect scrapbooking tape to put on it,” or, “I’m gonna go get my crafting stuff to add things on it.” I laughed and said No, that I liked my book the way it was. She kept pushing and pushing for her to decorate it and it got to the point where I firmly tell her no, that I was happy with what my books looked like at the moment, and I would be very upset if she did something to it, and went to sleep. 


If upset was the only word to explain how I was feeling, It would still be an understatement. 


I woke up and completely forgot about the book, and I only remembered when my mum picked me up and told me to collect my things. I asked my aunt where she put my book, and she had a cheeky grin and said “Your new and improved book is over here” and she pulled it out. 

I. was. furious. The book wasn’t ugly, but still. She didnt listen to what I told her to do, and did the exact OPPOSITE. I started yelling at her asking her “Why did you do that? I specifically told u not to. You waited until I fell asleep to do it?” She had a sad expression on her face, and that kinda made me feel bad, but it honestly was the last straw. I got in the car and my mum God bless her soul was so tired so all she told her sister was that when I tell her not to do something, she needs to listen and respect that. 

I still feel bad I yelled at her, especially seeing her expression after. AITA?

Update; I called her and apologized for yelling. I know the comments were on the fence about me apologizing, but I recognized that yelling at her was not the correct choice and there were multiple different approaches to the situation. I am a very neat person and I like all my belongings a certain way and color, so her doing that irritates me not only because it didn’t “match the vibe”, but because I clearly expressed I didn’t want her to. Anyways, I sat my mum down and told her how I felt, and she offered to drive me to my aunts place so I could apologize. I said no (it was my mum’s day off) and that I would call her. I called her, and she said she was surprised for me yelling at her because she thought she was just decorating and helping me because it looked “sad”. I asked her what she meant and she said the book looked depressing and needed a bit of pop. I told her respectfully that it didn’t matter how she took it, if I enjoyed it then that was all that mattered. She mumbled an “I guess” and kept going off about how “some people just don’t appreciate help”. She asked me if I used it still and I said no because I didn’t like how it looked now and I had an extra anyway and found similar stickers. She proceeded to tell me I was a “neat-freak” and “might have OCD.” I.  Had. It. I went off. Not in a bad tone, in a firm one. I said “Auntie, if you see a house on your street, and you don’t like the color, you don’t paint the house. It was my notebook. I liked it the way it was. You asked if you could decorate, I said no. If someone is your age and doesn’t understand boundaries, Lord help them. When someone says no, it means no. I don’t have OCD for not liking a book you decorated after I specifically told you I did not want you to decorate it.” The phone was quiet, then a simple “Just crazy.” and she hung up.

1l7gavf,WIBTA if I told my wife to get off her phone and take care of the baby?,"the title basically says it all, but to add some detail - we have an 11 months old, I work full time, my wife stays home indefinitely taking care of the baby, that was a mutually agreed arrangement that couldn't work any other way as her income would have been less than half of mine. I would love to stay home if that was feasible 

my wife seems to have a common these days phone addiction, where she will be glued to the screen for hours either watching reels, videos or messaging or exchanging audio messages with friends. I have no problem with that, I'm on my phone often myself, it is what it is, that's the way most of us decompress in 2025, but I do see the difference in our ability to snap out of it - I'm on my phone in my downtime and I can drop it at a moments notice for example because the baby crawled to me or there is something to do, my wife on the other hand tunes out completely and doesn't see or hear anything around her. I also tend to pick my phone when work is done, the house is clean and the baby asleep, while she is on it in the middle of things - as we are going somewhere, getting ready, cleaning, putting baby to sleep etc

She is also on her phone a lot when I'm leaving for work and it's actually time to be actively engaged with the baby, to the point where the baby might be crawling after me as I'm closing the door or running to me as soon as I come back, which is stressing me out a lot. I also notice it a lot when I'm driving and my wife is in the backseat on a baby duty, but actually completely ignoring any crying or screaming, again, to the point that I have to reach back and give a pacifier or sing a song to get the baby to calm down as I drive

she gets very defensive whenever that's brought up, either turning it into ""well you are using your phone as well"" or ""well that's for work"" because she does some side projects online, which is fair, but the amount of the time she spends and the money it brings is nowhere close to making it worth it, nor is it actually taking most of her time on the phone

WIBTA for calling it out and saying that she needs to at least put in 8 hours of phone free baby time every day and then we can split the evenings?

UPDATE, since this is getting out of hand and I can't engage with everyone:

1) the question is framed in a provocative manner because this sub requires a clear conflict spelled out, no, I'm not actually looking to police my wife's phone time, but directionally I am concerned with the balance between baby needs / self-care via doomscrolling

2) I am not expecting 24/7 attention on the baby from my wife or myself, that wouldn't be possible or healthy, but I do think there is a time for naps/meals/independent play/active play + need for passive supervision for safety reasons and soothing as required and the conflict seems to be in where to strike the right balance 

3) I am not talking about neglect, obviously the baby is healthy and clean and well fed and is hitting all the milestones, that doesn't mean though that she is getting sufficient face to face time, including reading, playing, singing, being held etc

4) might be a cultural / regional norm, but I wasn't even aware that sitting in the back with the baby in the car or letting them sleep in the stroller/outside can be weird to anyone. In any case we are in agreement about that with my wife so that's not an issue for us, baby is happy with it too

5) I don't think ""crying it out"" is a legitimate parenting approach and my wife doesn't think that it is either, but she ends up unintentionally using it if distracted by the phone, which, when I'm there, means I need to drop anything I'm doing and tend to the baby, or if I'm not there, results _potentially_ in a inconsolably crying baby which I'm not a fan of.

6) I'm not the dad of the year nor attempt to look like one, but I do a significant portion of childcare and am very involved. Obviously everybody is still going to project whatever they/their partner/their gender stereotype is telling them, so I can't argue with everyone about my actual level of involvement. The issue is really about when I'm not there, so what I'm doing when I am there might make it more or leas fair, but won't fix it",SomeAd8993,2210,0.8299999833106995,1572,1749502648,2025-06-09 15:57:28,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l7gavf/wibta_if_i_told_my_wife_to_get_off_her_phone_and/,6,2025
1leuzcp,AITA for telling my mom that I don't care if she leaves?,"I'm (F24) pregnant, living with my husband and four cats. My mom has struggled financially since divorcing my dad when I was young. At 18, I moved in with her after a fight with my dad, working and studying while helping her with bills. Two and a half years ago, I met my husband, quit working, graduated university, and moved into a new house with him and my cats. My husband earns well, providing a comfortable life, and began supporting my mom financially when I stopped working. Recently, she moved in with us because she couldn’t afford rent, agreeing to help with chores for extra money. However, she’s been toxic, constantly complaining about issues like a broken toilet, and after a man came fix it, she complained about the man and said she had no privacy. She also invited my older sister, with whom I’m estranged, my husband said she couldn't come, leading to conflict, but he even offered to drive her somewhere where they could meet, she refused. My mom now complains about my husband to me, which makes me feel bad to the point of crying. I tell her to not get me involved, but she only tells me and never him, like a coward. Then she plays the victim. Today she threatened to move out after an argument, I told her to do what she wants and that I no longer care, and she twisted it as me kicking her out. It’s exhausting, but my priority is my baby’s well-being, which depends on my own. I want her to leave but feel guilty because she has nothing. I'm not exaggerating, every. single. day. she complains about something/acts offended/plays the vicitm. She also says my husband is stingy, for not helping her more, but this isn't comunism. I'm tired. When I cry she says I play the victim only cause I'm pregnant like ???

1l7gk9l,AITA for involving myself and angering the new neighbors?,"I(33f) live in a culdesac with 5 other house on my street. 3 of these houses have motorcycles. Now, i must say, the bikers are really respectful of noise. One gets home late, one leaves early and they walk their bikes to the end of the road before they start them so they dont disturb the gaggle of young children in the neighborhood. Often times, you will see the bikers giving kids rides around the circle. All in all, fantastic neighbors. 

On to the issue. Recently, the only empty house on our street was bought by a young family. Mom and dad look to be in their early to mid 20s, and the kids look to be maybe 3 and 5. Mom started making a fuss the moment they moved in over the bikes. ""They are too loud"" ""they shouldnt have bikes around such young kids"" and finally ""they keep waking my kids up in the middle of the noght"". Most of us ignored them until they yelled at my neighbor for driving thru at 2pm on a Saturday. He was driving under the speed limit and he was making a normal amount of noise.

I was outside when she started walking towards him and his bike, screaming about the bikes and horrible neighbors. I got up, walked over and yelled back that she moved into OUR neighborhood and she could clearly see the bikes when they were viewing the house. She turned on me telling me i was a monster for allowing my kids near that death trap and it was ridiculous that i hadnt complaimed yet. I told her she was a crazy b-word and to stay off both of our properties, that she and her family could keep to themselves and could go suck a catcus.

She wont so much as look at me now but one of our neighbors said that i was being a dick and that it was a hell of a way to welcome them to the community. I do feel bad now because i hate to speak to people like that.

I was on a girls trip recently and there was a piercing store offering piercings for a good deal so a couple friends and I got matching belly piercings. I’ve been wanting to get a belly piercing for a couple years now so I decided to take a leap with my friends. I didn’t inform my boyfriend beforehand since I didn’t think it would be a big deal cause it’s a small piercing, but when I told him about it after he called me impulsive and made me feel really bad about it, said he would’ve tried convincing me out of it as well. I apologized for not taking his opinion into consideration and explained my thought process. But he’s been accusing me of wanting to keep this belly piercing a secret from him, even tho I've told him I've been meaning to get one for yrs and excitedly showed it to him right after since i was super happy about it. The way hes wording everything just feels a bit controlling, I'm not sure if it's that big of a deal that I got a piercing without letting him know beforehand since I feel like he's blowing the situation out of proportion.

1lokoh0,WIBTA if I backed out of a sibling camping trip aftery sister last minueTe decided to take our niece,"I 35F was scheduled to go on a camping trip with my older brother his 2 daughters age 12 and 14 and my younger sister in 12 days. My younger sister 30F booked the camping site and we all paid our share to her 101 each. My sister had decided not to bring her dog or invite my younger brother and his 3 young kids ages 2-6 because she did not want to spend her vacation babysitting,she wanted to drink and relax. My older brother and I agreed as we both work high stress jobs and just really need a break. That brings us to today my sister calls me and informs me that my 6 year old niece will be joining us and that we will be baby sitting her for the trip. I am now considering dropping out of the trip for a few reasons, one I feel blindsided that my sister offered to bring our niece along without consulting anyone first. Also I know she did not contact my older brother about this as she knows he would not be okay with taking her. I adore my niece but babysitting her is really taxing she has severe ADHD and is prone to screaming fits when ever she is told no.

1letyfj,WIBTA if I kicked my dad's girlfriend out of our home?,"I really need outside opinions because I don’t know if I am being super unreasonable.

My mum died when I was a teenager. In her will, she left the house to me but gave my dad a right to live in it until he dies. She inherited our family home from her parents so it was always just in her name.

Honestly I never thought of it as “my house.” Even though legally it is. I moved away for uni but after I got a good job back in our hometown, I moved back in. I have been living here again for a few years now. 

I guess I knew deep down that my dad must have dated over the years but he never talked about it and never introduced me to anyone and honestly I kind of liked it that way. I didn't want to know that he moved on. It was just us- him and me against the world.

His new girlfriend kind of appeared out of nowhere. I met her a couple of times and suddenly she moved in without any prior discussion. 

I was stunned but I tried to be happy for him. I really, really did. I tried my best to be polite and keep my resentment to myself. But it’s getting harder every single day. Every time I see them giggling in the kitchen or cuddled up on the sofa my mum picked out, I want to scream. My mum who died too young, who loved my dad, who was only ever with my dad, who never got a chance to move on. And now I have to watch him do it, every single day, in her house, in her childhood home. I didn't know I just feels like this is so disrespectful to my mum's memory.

She is redecorating. She has moved furniture. She changed the curtains and wallpapers my mum and I picked together and reorganised the kitchen cupboards.

And worse she has been making comments like, “Have you ever thought about living independently now that you are settled in your career?” Or telling my dad they will need to turn my room into nursery eventually when they have kids as the third room is his home office.

Like. What?? The absolute audacity.

I’m not a tenant or a guest. I own the goddamn house. My dad just has a right to live here but I don't think that right gives him the right to just move in a partner and act like it’s their shared marital home especially when I live here too. If he wants to build a life with her he should at least move out and not do it in my mum's home.

From what i understand she has no legal right to live here. She is not a tenant as she pays no rent. I think I can legally kick her out anytime i want to without a court order. At best she is an ""excluded occupier"" and can be evicted with reasonable notice which is classed as one rental period. And I don't think even that is applicable here.

I havent confronted him yet but I am this close to sitting my dad down and saying all this. And if he refuses, I am considering speaking to a solicitor and making it happen formally. I know it would cause a huge rift but i am so tired of feeling like a stranger in my own home. I feel like my mum is being erased.

1ljpb3e,WIBTA if I don’t attend my daughter’s wedding because her father will be there?,"
28 yrs ago, my daughter’s father left us for our babysitter just a week after her 1st birthday. He had 2 kids with her, & left her for their babysitter as well. Moved across the USA and married her. Our daughter didn’t see or hear from him at all. No emails, calls, no child support. When she was 14 we discovered she was bipolar & put me thru hell, even with medication. Fast forward 28 years. Found out lots of things, including that he had people spying on me all those years & reporting back to him on what I was doing. “He was worried about the kids with me as a parent.” (For context - I raised 7 kids (this daughter Is child #4, mostly as a single parent, by my own choice. I never had a welfare check, went thru college 3 times for 3 different  degrees and never had the electric shut off, go to a shelter or was homeless.) he Never sent any messages, emails, phone calls, birthday card, anything. Now, I’m raising said daughter’s son, he is 9 and I have had him since he was 1 due to neglect and emotional abuse. He will soon be 10. She visits with him when it’s convenient for her, which isn’t often. Her boyfriends have always been twice her age and way more important to her than her son. One bf went to prison. We have full legal custody and have the right to tell her no any time we like, but for the boy’s benefit, we figured some contact is better than none. He is in counseling and his counselor has ripped her a new ass twice. He said “either be all in or be all out.” She just can’t seem to do either one. She also didn’t pay child support for 7 years, but the last 18 months they ordered her to pay $60 a month, which we discovered her father has been sending her to pay. She cant hold a job or a place to live. He gave her a BMW & drove it here. He’s given her thousands of dollars & paid her rent. He has said some vile stuff about me that has gotten back to me. I feel like both of them has really made a lot of my adult life a lot harder than it has had to be. While they’re off living it up & having fun, being all “lovey dovey family” while I’m over here exhausted and struggling. While I went on with my life and I have a wonderful man now….my daughter and her twice her age flavor of the week are talking about getting married. He hs had a vasectomy, doesnt ever want kids and has no desire to be in this boy’s life, let alone encourage her to do it. Good for her, if that’s what makes her happy. However, I have zero desire to attend that wedding, especially if her father is there and giving her away. Their relationship is not my business and I hope it’s a happy one, but I really have no desire to have all that rubbed in my face. It’s like neither one ever gave a shit how their behavior affected my heart, soul, or life. Would I be an asshole if I choose not to attend?

1l55bfp,AITA for being possessive over my food?,"So, I’m going to get straight to the point.

Today, I brought wings and fries. I didn’t finish it all so I put it in the fridge so I could have it later.

Few hours later, I go into the fridge and it was all gone. Mind you, there was 4 wings and a whole container of fries in there.

It was just me, my mom’s boyfriend (Sam) and his son so, I asked Sam where my food went and he said he gave it to his son.

Obviously, I was upset because 1. You didn’t even ask and 2. You gave all of it to him, knowing he wouldn’t finish it so now half of the food I paid for is sitting in the trash.

I told him to stop just feeding my food to his son without asking, which he does ALL the time. He’ll take my food from the fridge, and just give it to his son. He never, ever asks. 

Like I don’t mind sharing but I feel like taking my things without asking isn’t nice.

He told me I’m being possessive over food and that it’s not that deep. Sam also said I’m 16 refusing to share with an 8 year old as if I’m a toddler.

1la0lx4,AITA for refusing to help my roommate move out after they broke our lease early?,"I’m 26F and had been living with a roommate for almost two years. We renewed our lease back in March for another full year. Things were pretty normal, no major drama, we split rent and utilities evenly and mostly did our own thing.

A few weeks ago, my roommate got a new job in another city. Cool, good for them. But they gave me two weeks’ notice that they were moving out and had already spoken to the landlord about getting their name off the lease. No plan, no subletter lined up, nothing. Just “I figured you could cover things for a while until you find someone.”

I told them that wasn’t going to work for me. I didn’t agree to live alone and I definitely can’t afford this place on my own. They brushed it off and basically said I should be supportive of their “big opportunity” and that I’d figure something out.

Fast forward to moving day and they asked if I’d help them carry furniture, load the U-Haul, clean, etc. I told them no. I said I didn’t feel right helping out after the way they left me with everything. They got really cold after that and told some of our mutual friends that I was being bitter and making their move more stressful out of spite.

Now some people are saying I should’ve just helped to be the bigger person and that it wouldn’t have killed me to lift a few boxes. Others agree with me and say it was pretty bold of them to expect help after bailing.

1l7j8s9,AITA for returning the jewelry my husband gave me for our 10 year anniversary?,"Hey reddit, long time reader and possible asshole here. My Husband (34M) bought me (32F) a beautiful necklace and earring set for our 10 year anniversary. He had it professionally wrapped and included three different types of liquor filled chocolates in the box. It was stunning, my favorite color, and I was SO appreciative of the time and effort he took in picking out a set I would truly like. Here's the problem. During this time my husband, we'll call him E, and I were struggling, not only in our relationship but with finances as well. E would spend most nights out with friends while I was home with our kids. We had many disagreements about his drinking, partying, and late nights. Because of everything that was going on I had chosen to take a break from alcohol. E knew I wasn't drinking so I was somewhat disappointed when I saw the chocolates. Now, I have never been much of a jewelry person but I was very happy with the set E got me. I had planned on wearing it the next day but forgot in the whirlwind of getting kids ready for school. E asked me why I wasn't wearing it that afternoon and said that if he was going to have to go hungry to afford the set he hoped I would at least wear it. I immediately felt terrible that I forgot to wear it and that it cost so much. I asked him how much he spent and it was enough to pay off a few bills and reduce some of our stress financially. Knowing that and how my husband wasn't able to eat lunch for the week I didn't feel right wearing the set. During that time, he continued to ask why I wouldn't wear the necklace and reminded me that he wasn't able to eat lunch because of what it cost. Now, this is where I might be the asshole. I took the set back to the store he got it at, told them I didn't like it, and returned it. It broke my heart to return it but they were able to give me a full refund minus a small fee. I took the money and paid off a few of our debts and said nothing. With how little I wear jewelry I had hoped he wouldn't notice after some time had passed. Unfortunately, someone he knew was in the store and saw me return it. A few days later E and I had a long conversation about how hurt he was. I apologized and explained why I returned it and how sad I was that he would choose to go hungry to get me something material. Shortly after we decided to go to therapy together and things have gotten better. However, I noticed for the last several holidays E hasn't gotten me anything, not even a card. He says it's because I'll return anything he gets for me. This has become a recurring disagreement between us where he says I'm the asshole.

I 19, female and my friend 20 female are currently having an argument over the stupidest thing ever.

Here's the context. So, I order things from online A LOT and recently, I ordered a few things from a popular brand. Now, my packages were spilt up so what I ordered would've come on two separate days(far apart) which I didn't mind. 

I picked up the first package and a week or so later, I kept seeing notifications in my email about a package(completely different tracking number than either of my split up packeges) pop up. I checked my bank account to see if maybe I had ordered something and didn't remember but that wasn't the case.

I brushed it off and ignored it. A few days later, the mystery package and my original package came up as delivered so I went and collected both since they were BOTH addressed to me. For the mystery package, I paid 50$ to clear it. 

As soon as I got home, I dug through the mystery package since I paid a good buck to collect it, was awfully curious and I thought the company gifted me free items since I shop on their site quite often. There were slippers, shorts, dresses and a few other things in the package all which I'd never personally order but they were good picks. I gave away one of the dresses and currently am wearing one of the shorts while typing this lol. 

Now, the actual tea. My friend sent me a message today asking if I had received a package recently(i picked up the package a week ago and we talked. I did mention getting freebies and it didn't go beyond that) and I said yes and obviously started telling her about my freebies(again). She asked what exactly I got, I told her then SHE said it wasn't free since it was HERS. How? Well, she placed an order from the same site I buy from and put MY address in to have it delivered to ME. Did she ever tell me about this before today? No. Am I shocked and lowkey upset? Kinda, yeah because why wouldn't she tell me that? I told her I took two items since I initially thought I was mine and she could have the rest of her stuff. 

Now, the cause for the argument? She said I'd have to pay her back for the two items I took and I refused since I did pay 50$ to collect it(she no longer has to) and my other friend works close to where she lives so she'd get free delivery too. She called me selfish and a b-word(dunno if I can say that here) and has been telling our mutual friends and my mom about what happened. She's been saying I STOLE from her and refused to pay her back. My mom's saying I should pay her to keep the peace and my friends are split on the situation. So reddit, am I the ahole for refusing to pay back my friend after she ordered her package to be delivered to me?

P.s. I tried to edit this as much as possible, sorry for any typos.

I told my mom this over and over again and I for the past days had been informing her of the huge amounts of pain in my feet and legs.
Yet she still decided to offer me up to help someone move out of her house which had involved some very heavy lifting that could have injured my legs and feet given the tension and stress already upon them.
The person she offered me up to help had called her while I was in the same room and said “If he doesn’t want to go, he doesn’t have to. No was an acceptable answer.” And after I heard this I blew up on her yelling at her that I had been in a very large amount of pain in specifically my upper and lower legs for the past 4 days while this person was on call, and that she clearly hadn’t listened to me and continued to not listen to me and or didn’t care about my physical or mental health because she made decisions for me regardless of it being my choice, and me being in severe pain.

1lisji4,AITA for not bringing my kids to their stepmom?,"I have two children, 12 and 9. Their father left me while I was pregnant with my second. He and his GF have two together also. 

He is out of town for work. He said he would be back in about a month. He is scheduled to have the kids every other weekend. He will not take them for his weekend because he has to work, he has plans with his other family, or my kids have a stuffy nose/headache and aren’t allowed. He often goes 2-3 months without seeing the kids.

He is pushing me at this point to still bring my kids over to his GF on the weekends so that they “can keep them on a schedule” and see their siblings. The thing is, I flat out refuse to interact with his GF at all. She has accused me of heinous things. She talks down to me and is all around disrespectful. I will not put up with it anymore. This has been going on since the beginning.

I have been accused of drinking throughout my pregnancy, withholding my children, making up medical conditions that my youngest has, and putting my hands on their child. I drew the line and cut off contact then. I do not feel that my kids are taken care of while they are there. My youngest has several food allergies that they said I made up and would continually cause flare ups because they kept feeding them the foods they react to.

More recently, my kids have expressed that they don’t want to be there. Their siblings are mean to them. There is no corrective action towards this behavior. My youngest is called a wimp, a pussy, a nerd, etc. Their kids will get to go do fun things while mine are left to clean the house. At this point, I don’t even feel comfortable with my kids being there when their dad IS in town. I have told him no to his requests every time he has brought it up. He refuses to acknowledge any of what has happened and will not accept no as an answer.

They both think I’m being unreasonable and vindictive towards their kids. So, AITA for not doing this?

My daughter is heartbroken. My wife is pissed and I changed the locks. 

MIL is telling everyone I'm a monster who spoils my daughter because she can take the bus.

1li21zm,"AITA for revealing the ""rental costs"" of my van after the trip was made?","I was recently asked to help out since my friends could not go on a trip they needed to make because the car they meant to take was not good for use at the time, and I own a travel van. I also got invited to join on said trip to drive since it was a really long trip and a short time to make it, and it was questionable if one of them could even drive due to a health problem that arose near departure. The trip was to another country to take something there and another thing home from there. Most of the time I was more or less treated like staff and as someone not very welcome in their circle. During the trip one of them started to ask who's turn it is to pay for gas this time, and I was pointed out as the one. Also they spoke of evening out the costs afterwards, clearly implying I was to pay an equal amount of everything. Of course I was going to pay for my own food and other costs like any decent human being would and was not going to ask for compensation for the use of the van to be a fair friend, but was assuming that since the trip was not a holiday trip planned together but rather I was invited out of necessity quite last minute, I should not be paying for gas (at least not an equal amount which would make me the one paying the highest price for the entire trip since the van was mine and I pay for the keeping of it). I gave them some time to make their intentions clear about how they thought the costs should be divided, and was left with the impression before mentioned and so decided to let them know that I wanted them to pay rent per mile to cover costs of using the van. The price I set was the same I use with any other friend who would take a trip with the van without me, and very fair at that. So this lead to me being called a criminal for not letting them know beforehand they'd need to pay ""rent"". Am I really the ahole here?

1li0wze,AITA  for not letting my husband sleep in swim trucks?,"We had a chill day today that involved our pool (no drinking). We dried after reading beside it, I made dinner, we had a long conversation, watched a show and then it was time for bed. Even tired, I still took a quick shower to rinse my body before bed. Husband didn’t want to, fine, I didn’t complain. But he was in bed in his swim trunks so I asked when he was taking them off. He said he was sleeping in them.

Normally, he sleeps in his underwear only. I sometimes sleep in a t shirt that i only use in bed and undies, sometimes my birthday suit. It depends. And honestly, idk why it bothers me so much that his swim trunks were in bed, but to me they’re like dirty shorts. He’s worn them outside on dusty furniture, has cat fur all over them, doesn’t wash frequently, that kind of vibe. So it feels like outside clothes shouldn’t be in bed. I’m not a super clean person but any means, but I like my bed to feel clean.

He said he was too lazy to change into his underwear. No problem buddy, I’ll get them for you. Begrudgingly he changed into them, even though he didn’t want clean undies on his dirty body. I agree with that but prefer it over his dirty swimshorts in our bed. 

Anyways, I don’t like feeling like a control freak or nagging wife, I keep the bar pretty low in general, so I don’t always know when my requests/insisting is actually reasonable or if I’m being extra. My husband didn’t think there was any “rule” about what you’re allowed to wear to bed and I disagreed and said there’s an unwritten rule. He says he needs it in writing, so here I am.

1lmyqd5,AITA for not letting my mom into my apartment when her power went out during a heat wave,"Okay so I (24F) am working a summer festival this weekend meaning I work roughly 12 hour days that are very busy. My mom (60F) texted me around 10 am saying her power went out and it's really hot in the house (we are currently in the middle of a heat wave and it's roughly 90⁰F with high humidity). I told her she doesn't have a key (I don't have the best relationship with her) and I didn't have time to give her one today. She kept begging and eventually I had to leave her on read and I've felt really guilty about it even though I'm pretty sure I was being perfectly reasonable. For full context I included a transcript of the text convo in this post. 




Mom: The power is out. Can I hang out at your apartment if it doesn't come on soon. Super hot


Me: Do you have a key? Also its pretty hot in my apartment even with the AC on so idk how much better it is lol. You might have more luck going to like the library or a coffee shop. 


Mom: I don't have a key but I'd rather hang out there than the library if I can


Me: idk how you'd get in without a key


Mom: can (insert GFs name here) let me in?


Me: shes working till 4 today


Mom: can I get a key from you or do you not want me there


Me: I'm running around a lot today idk when I could give you the key or how I'd get it back 


Mom: that makes me feel great


Mom, a few minutes later: please



At this point I just left her on read


For added context without getting too much into it"" when I moved out about two years ago she wouldn't let me take my mattress or my bed frame because ""she bought it for the room"" and I couldn't take the AC unit I had in my room because they were going to use it but it's literally been sitting in the corner of my old bedroom, uninstalled and unused for the last two years. I purposefully did not give her a key to my apartment because I knew otherwise she would drop in unannounced as she never gave me personal space when I lived with her. 

Anyways AITA?


Update 1:

Hey everyone! Lots of people are asking if there's more reasons I don't have a great relationship with me mom and the answer is yes. She refuses to acknowledge my SA and has asked me repeatedly to visit said relative with her. Additionally I have been her therapist for as long as I can remember and have been the acting mom of the household until I moved out. Additionally she lives with my two siblings (both 21) and has a bf who lives about 90 mins away. She is fully mobile and can drive. The reason I am so wishy washy in my texts is because this is the best way my therapist and I have found to communicate with her without her having a meltdown. I do 100% wish I could be more blunt with her as I am a very blunt person otherwise but it's really difficult

Thanks everyone!

1livtwi,"WIBTA if I refuse to come home from college, daily, to do house chores?","I'll be starting college this fall. I was invited to apply to a leadership program where I must live on a specific dorm floor with others in the program. With my past leadership experience and major, having this credential only makes sense. After talking to my dad about it, he said go for it (knowing I will have to live on campus - across our very large city).

He just gave me a list of things I'll be expected to do daily once school starts. With my dad working long hours I've always been the one to take care of anything to do with the house (and the 5 dogs my dad has taken in with no conversation with my sister and I). My sister is 14 and doesn't do anything. Homework during the year? no. Cleaning her room? no. Cleaning up after her friends? no. Taking care of the dog she begged for? no. She's never been given a chore list like this.

I'm trying to graduate a year early from college (like I did in HS) and so that means I'm taking a full in person schedule and multiple online classes. I don't have time to come home early in the morning to take care of the dogs, go to my morning classes, use my lunch break to come back and take care of the dogs again, attend afternoon classes, go to work, take care of the dogs again, and then spend time on my online classes.

I understand that I am a part of this family and therefore should have responsibilities, but giving me a list of things to do daily, when most of them only have to be done a few times a week, is insane to me. It would make sense if I had some responsibilities on the weekends and breaks from school but every day is wild. Even if I had a list of things to do every weekend and my sister handles minor things during the week. Not to mention, the amount of extra gas I'll be paying for by going back and fourth 3 times daily.

So WIBTA if I told him there's no way I'm doing all this while handling a job, an overloaded course load, and while trying to find a bit of a social life while my sister does nothing and all he does is come home from work at 12AM and ends up drunk?


Edit:
-I'm a minor (obviously)
-My dad isn't paying a cent for my education
-I've grown up very independent
-I know what it's like to be around older young adults (I was taking in person college classes at night as a 15 year old where I was a part of study groups of many different types of people)

She told me to stop laughing cause it’s a horror film and not a comedy. I could not help it, I was laughing so hard at the first death sequence. I just found the whole Goldbergian chain of events that caused said deaths to be hilarious. I was the only person laughing in the theatre. 

She was not happy and was pissed off on the way home. She said I ruined the tone of the film. I tried to stifle my laughter and some of the deaths I didn’t find funny so I didn’t laugh during them. But when a funny death did happen I couldn’t help but laugh.
