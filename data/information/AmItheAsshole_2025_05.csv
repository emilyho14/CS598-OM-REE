1klzbca,AITA for grounding my stepdaughter for selling my formal dress?,"I 37F have a stepdaughter, Amy, 16F. Amy was looking for formal dresses, and I mentioned that I have my old formal dresses. She picked my old prom dress to wear, and she has kept it in her wardrobe since wearing it at prom. I don't fit in my old dresses anymore, and I kept them and some other clothes to hand down to my kids, however, I have two sons who aren't interested. Since my nieces, 15F and 13F are interested in my clothes, I planned to give them the rest once they were old enough to fit them.

  
Amy left her earbuds in her sweatpants pocket and turned on the washing machine. When she asked for new ones, me and her dad told her to save up to buy new ones (she works part time) as she wanted an expensive brand new pair and not the wired earphones I had offered. 

  
Amy went to stay with her mom, and when she got back, she had the new earbuds she wanted, so I asked if her mom had bought them for her, and she said she had resold my dress on a second-hand site and bought herself the earphones. The dress is 100% silk, one of a kind, and the brand doesn't exist anymore. I was really upset to hear she had sold my dress, without even asking.

  
I confiscated her earbuds and told her I would give them back when she repaid me the cost of what she sold the dress for. My husband thinks I am being too harsh, as I wasn't explicit on whether I was lending or giving her the dress. Amy has gone to live with her mom since and thinks I am being unfair. I am not sure if I have taken it too far and if I should stand my ground.",Capable-Schedule-864,14648,0.9399999976158142,1535,1747175061,2025-05-13 17:24:21,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1klzbca/aita_for_grounding_my_stepdaughter_for_selling_my/,5,2025
1kynst0,AITA for not putting away my copy of The Handmaid’s Tale?,"My(20) uncle and cousin(14) are currently staying with us since their house is going through some repairs. Cousin sleeps in my room. Mom told me to put certain books away since they are inappropriate so I put them in a small locked drawer. I didn’t put The Handmaid’s Tale and some of my other dystopian novels there, though. Barely any space left so I had to pick which ones to lock up. The way I figured it, she probably wouldn’t be interested in them and the book in question full of my distracting, barely legible to anyone else annotations(I studied it for A Level English Literature when I was 16-17 and my handwriting was atrocious back then).

But she did end up getting interested in it. I came home one day to find out that she had been reading it and my uncle had found out and was telling her she is too young. Then he turned to me and berated me, saying it was careless to leave something she is too young for out on the shelf",EfficientWest871,14157,0.8999999761581421,2220,1748556751,2025-05-29 17:12:31,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kynst0/aita_for_not_putting_away_my_copy_of_the/,5,2025
1kp4ekd,"AITA for giving my daughter $60 a week, but my son nothing?","I (45F) have two kids, 17F and 15M. We moved earlier this year to be closer to my parents as my parents health is declining. My daughter was excited about the move, but my son has struggled to adjust.

Due to the move, my job shifted to hybrid, and I needed a work-from-home setup. My bedroom is too small, and the only options were the lounge or one of the kids’ rooms during school hours. I proposed this to them - my son flat-out refused (“no way in hell”), but my daughter offered her room and half-joked about charging me rent for the space.

I thought it was fair, as I get a $20/day work-from-home allowance. I agreed to give it to her if she was okay with me setting up a small office in her room. I work from 8:30 to 5:00, and she usually starts homework right after I finish, so it’s worked out well.

Now the issue: my son is pissed that his sister is getting $60. I don’t do regular allowances, just canteen money (about $10/week) and other needs as they come up. I told him he had the same opportunity and was now shit out of luck. He got angry and brought up the move, saying he never gets to see his friends. (For the record, I drive them back to visit every two weeks for visits) I told him I understood his feelings but said I wouldn’t tolerate being spoken to like shit. He then started an argument with his sister too - going in on her for being an opportunistic bitch and she called him a whiny little asshole.

To cool off, I offered one of them the option to stay at their grandparents for the night - not as a punishment but to break the tension. My son opted to go & while dropping him off, my mom told me I was favoring my daughter and should be paying them equally. My dad disagreed, saying my son had the chance and was shit out of luck.

AITA?

1kvd1su,"AITA for posting screenshots of my SIL's texts online and ""making her look bad""?","I (29F) and my wife (28F) had our sons six days ago, the pregnancy was complicated and they had TTTS (Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome) which resulted in them coming early. They are currently in the Neonatal Unit and my wife and I practically live there so we can spend time with our boys. 

My brother and his wife got married two days ago, I didn't want to leave my sons or my wife so I missed the wedding though I sent them their gift from us and a text wishing them a fantastic day and I thought nothing more of it. Yesterday I got a text from my new sister in law explaining that because my wife and I missed the wedding she'd need us to send her £140 for our plates of food. I asked her if she was joking and she told me that she got my wife couldn't go as she had to stay in the hospital but that I wasn't the one who gave birth so I could have went and saved two plates of food from going to waste.

I told her she was being ridiculous and asked if my brother was aware she was asking his sister for money for food, she brushed that off and said weddings were expensive and she had to try and recoup her losses and this should be between us ""woman to woman"". Between this and her thinking I should have gone anyway I admit I lost my temper. I ended up taking screenshots of the conversation and posting it to facebook.

This shocked several people in the family and she must have gotten bombarded with messages as she told me to take it down, as I was making her look bad and people were taking it out of context and thinking she was some kind of villain. My brother called me and told me not to worry about the money that it was stupid to expect us to pay for the plates though asked me to take the post down and he'd handle it. He seemed kind of shocked by her even asking this.

Did I go too far? My wife is mostly upset by our sil's comment about how I wasn't the one to give birth, as if it makes me less of their mother. Maybe I should have handled it better but I admit at the time I wasn't thinking very clearly.

Edit: I thought I said in the post but I didn't (sorry running on very little sleep) I took down the post when my brother asked me to do so.",SavingsBitter1426,11136,0.949999988079071,790,1748207077,2025-05-25 16:04:37,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kvd1su/aita_for_posting_screenshots_of_my_sils_texts/,5,2025

1km0znf,AITA for refusing to give up my life insurance payout and asking my ex’s family to refinance the car he left me?,"So my ex passed away recently in a work-related accident. It’s sad, of course. I have a lot of mixed emotions about it. But the truth is, we hadn’t been together in over a year when it happened. We were together for five years, and we broke up because he cheated on me and got someone else pregnant. That breakup wrecked me. It took me a long time to recover. I haven’t seen him since.

After the breakup, I went no contact. I’ve spent the past year healing, learning to be happy again, and moving on. I didn’t go to the funeral. I didn’t want to see the baby mama or his family. And while I’m not happy he’s gone, I can’t say I’m devastated anymore either. I grieved this person when I left the relationship.

Now here’s where things get complicated.

Six months after our breakup, and **after**   the baby was born, he took out a life insurance policy. In it, he named me as the 50% beneficiary. His mom and the baby mama each got 25%. I didn’t know this until the insurance company called me. I assumed it was some paperwork leftover from when we were together. But nope this was a new policy, dated well *after* the breakup. That means this was his decision.

At the same time, there’s a car. He financed it while we were still together, but it’s under *my name and credit.* I begged him for **over a year** to refinance it, to the point the only reason I ever contacted him was for the refinancing of that car. He never refinanced that car, I doubt he was ever going to. Now that he’s gone, it’s still tied to me. The car is sitting in my garage, and his family has reached out saying the baby mama needs it for work. I told them, fine. You can have it as soon as it’s refinanced and no longer on *my credit.* I will **GLADLY** sign whatever paper they need. But I am not going to risk my credit on people I don’t trust to make payments.

And now they’re demanding that I give up the life insurance payout too. That I should “do the right thing” and give it to his mom or the baby mama. But here’s the thing, *I didn’t ask for any of this.* I didn’t ask to be put on that policy. He made that choice, after everything that happened between us.

Honestly?

I feel like I *earned* that money. I spent five years with that man. Five years dealing with the stress, the gaslighting, the emotional pain, the betrayal. I loved him deeply and I lost so much trying to make that relationship work. I stayed with him until *I found out* his baby mama was pregnant, because he was *actively hiding it from me* at that time. I was with him through the worst parts of his life. If anything, this money feels like the only thing I ever got back from all the bullshit. He chose to leave it to me. Probably because deep down, he knew how badly he treated me.

1ktu6ss,AITA for walking out of my parents' anniversary party when my brother announced his engagement to my ex?,"I just discovered my brother (29M) has secretly been seeing my college ex-girlfriend (32M) over the past year. We broke up 8 years ago and we'd been going out 4 years prior to the split but we actually knew each other very seriously when we'd been together. I challenged him when I discovered this and he said he didn't say anything to me b/c he didn't want me to get angry with him.

Last weekend we celebrated my parents' 40th anniversary celebration. My brother brought her to the party as his guest without letting me know beforehand. Her arrival with my brother left me shocked since we broke up and I hadn't laid eyes on her since then. During the meal, they declared their engagement and my mom began crying tears of joy.

I couldn't take it and left. My brother trailed behind me and we got in a big fight. I told him he should have warned me at the very least. He said I was being self-centered and spoiling our parents' party.

That evening my dad phoned me telling me I humiliated the family by leaving.

I don't have romantic feelings towards my ex anymore, but the surprise reveal and secrecy at my parents' celebration feel thoughtless.

1kunvna,AITA for refusing to give a reward after two kids returned my opened mail with money inside?,"I'm 27F but I am pretty petite and could easily pass for like a high schooler. So I am home alone at my parent's place dog sitting and I get back from walking the dog and as soon as I close the door and lock it, I hear the ring cam doorbell go off and knocking and I can see through their Alexa that it's two kids. Probably middle school aged. They have a bike and scooter. I did not see them when I came back from the walk, so I don't know where they were waiting or where they even came from.  

They are just standing there and so I'm thinking that they are trying to sell something or another so I plan to just ignore them and focus on getting the dog resettled. Except now the dog is barking like crazy because she senses someone by the door and I can hear the kids say ""I just saw her go inside"". They then say ""we found something of yours and it has money inside"".

So they are knocking like crazy and even start kicking the door. I figure that I'll just speak to them through the ring bell so I say (without opening the door) ""Hi. Just leave it in the mailbox. I cannot open the door right now because my dog is not friendly"". Which is, true, but also like, I have no idea if this is a scheme or if there's an adult in a car waiting for them, etc. My mind is going into all sorts of scenarios that could end horribly for me. 

After them standing there for like five minutes, I can see through the cam that they put it in the mailbox and walk slowly away on their bike/scooter. About two minutes later, one of the kids comes back and puts his hood on. Rings the doorbell and I can see him put his hood on and I say ""what's up?"" through the ring cam. And he says ""My friend wants a reward"". And I say ""thank you for bringing back the mail but there is no reward, please leave"". And the kid just stands there demanding a reward. So I say ""I have your faces, if you try to threaten me, I will call the cops"". The kid then says ""call the cops I don't care! I returned your *money*. If I ever find something for your house again, I'm not returning it"". He then walks away before giving me the finger. 

I'm not looking to get these kids into any sort of trouble or anything because I think they were just being dumb fucks and they couldn't have been older than like 14/15 but AITA for not giving a reward? What they returned ended up being an opened envelope (don't know how they got it, if it was already ripped, or if they opened it) from my aunt that had a $20 bill in it (my aunt is old school like that). 

I've had my fair share of finding misplaced items/wallets and I've never once demanded or even expected a reward. My friend wanted me to post their faces on the NextDoor app and blast them but I don't know. So, AITA?

1kjkog3,WIBTA for wearing deodorant even though someone may be allergic?,"Throwaway account for privacy reasons. 

So, at the beginning of the second semester, we got a new teacher. This teacher said she had scent sensitivity and couldn't be around any perfume or fragrances. 


The people in my family have scent sensitives, so all my deodorant, soaps are unscented. 

I have continued wearing this deodorant for months, and I sit in the front of the class. This teacher has never seemed to react. 

Also, some of my friends put on scent products in the morning, and she never react, even though you can clearly smell it. 

Yesterday, I had Gym class and it ran over. I had to change into my school uniform and had no time to apply the deodorant. The bell rang and I was late for class. 

I reapplied the deodorant in the bathroom and went to class. However, I forgot to zip up my backpack. When I was in class, the deodorant fell out, and the teacher saw the deodorant. She asked if it was sent, and I said no. She then yelled at me, saying she was having an allergic reaction. 

But here's the thing. She didn't look like it. Her breathing didn't change, no watery eyes, stuffy nose, anything. And she just taught the class like normal.  

I felt bad and emailed her about what deodorant she didn't react so I could buy it, but got a response saying that was inappropriate. 

Part of me thinks she is faking. So, would I be the asshole if I just countinued wearing it.

1kw7k5z,AITAH for putting up a security cam that caught my neighbor's kid wrecking my yard?,"For the past month, weird stuff kept happening around my house (I’m F, 42). Gnomes knocked over, mailbox dented, flowers pulled out… just random annoying vandalism. I figured it was some local kids, but had no proof. After the 3rd time my flowers got destroyed, I’d had enough.

I set up a small cam facing my front yard. It’s on my property, not hidden or anything, just not super obvious. A couple days later, boom — caught my neighbor’s 10 y/o son yanking out my flowers and tossing them in the street. Clear as day.

I went over to their house, calm, showed the vid on my phone. I thought they’d apologize or offer to replace the plants. Nope. They lost it. Accused me of “spying” on their kid, said I was “overreacting” to a “harmless prank,” and even threatened legal action for “filming their child.”

I explained the camera’s legal, on my property, and only points at my yard. They wouldn’t hear it. It turned into a full-blown yelling match.

Now they’re telling everyone I’m some creepy neighbor who hates kids. The street’s basically split. Some are on my side, some are giving me dirty looks.

1kzjdfn,"AITA for continuing ""adult"" activities in front of children because they crashed my party?","I own a lakefront property and usually enjoy hosting friends and family. For example, every 4th of July I throw a big BBQ, cover all the food and drinks, and don’t mind if people bring extra guests as long as it’s respectful. My family gets it and never takes advantage. If someone brings more than one person, they’ll usually contribute something like drinks or sides.

This past Memorial Day Weekend, I planned a reunion for a close college friend visiting from abroad. It was meant to be a kid-free, adults-only weekend. Lots of drinking, with friends staying over afterwards. 

My cousin happened to ask if she could use my house and lake that weekend, and I kindly said no and suggested nearby resorts. She got annoyed, saying she’d already told her kids they were coming since I usually never say no. I explained about my party, and she didn’t reply, so I thought it ended there.

Then Saturday afternoon, she showed up with her kids anyway. I told her they couldn’t come inside, but they could hang out at the community lakefront nearby. The issue was that the kids kept trying to come in to use the bathroom, grab water, etc. My friends weren’t doing anything illegal, just drinking and having fun like adults do, but my cousin asked me to get them to tone it down because of her kids. I told her no. She wasn’t invited, and I wasn’t changing my party for uninvited guests. Plus, they were already well into drinking for the day so it’s not like I could instantly sober up 20+ adults.

Now she’s telling our family I let my friends act “inappropriately” in front of her kids. Some relatives think I should’ve paused the drinking, but others agree she was out of line for showing up uninvited. 

For what it’s worth, the kids didn’t interact with my friends and were only inside briefly (I made sure to keep an eye on them when they came in), but they could see the alcohol. Since they drove 1.5 hours, I didn’t feel right just kicking them out completely, but I also wasn’t going to let her hijack the weekend.

1kmru7h,AITA for not letting my husband with $13k debt have access to my credit card,"Okay so my husband (36M) and me (33M) keep getting into arguments over money, especially getting him onto my credit card as an authorised user.

I’ve got 0 credit score because I immigrated here to the U.S. and only just managed to open a line of credit. I wasn’t even able to finance a car without huge interest on it (only one bank accepted me) so I’m still without a car.

He has not been good with his credit history, racking up $13k of debt with Amex before we had met which he has yet to pay off. 

I suggested to him he should see if he can improve it with a credit builder loan but I am not comfortable with him being on my credit card or having my CC details in his phone. He responds with saying married couples should be sharing assets and building credit together? 

Is it a given that spouses should have shared credit? Because I’m trying to establish my own credit history I cannot risk a bad credit score if he racks up debt without the means of paying it off. At the same time I feel guilty because he did support me when I wasn’t able to work before I got employment authorisation. 

Am I the asshole here for protecting my own interests? 

UPDATE: Thanks everyone! I really needed this vote of confidence and encouragement to stand my ground on this. I feel less guilty for putting my foot down with him. Going to see if I can put a freeze on my credit report this week and see if we can get him onto a personal finance course.

1kzignf,AITA for telling a clients boyfriend to leave?,"I’m a 27yo (F) and I work as a piercer in a parlour. Recently, this girl came into the shop with her boyfriend and told me that she wanted to get both of her nipples pierced. As I was helping her pick out the jewellery she wanted for her piercings, I noticed that the entire time her boyfriend was just sulking behind her. He kept asking her if she really had to get her nipples pierced and was overall just creating an extremely awkward vibe. 

When we went into the back so I could do the piercing, her boyfriend came along, which I don’t mind as many people bring someone along with them. As I was preparing everything, her boyfriend asked me If there was any way I could pierce her nipples without having to see her boobs. I told him that obviously she doesn’t have to just completely show me her boobs, but I still need to be able to see her nipples or how else would I be able to pierce her?  He then started speaking to her quietly but I could still hear what he was saying. He was saying that he wasn’t comfortable with someone who wasn’t him seeing her in that way. I didn’t understand why he was being so insecure as this is just my job? I don’t view what I’m doing as sexual, i’m just simply giving someone a piercing

And then he asked me in these exact words if i’m “into girls” and I tried to make a lighthearted joke by asking him why that mattered and he just responded by asking if i’m going to be “turned on” by seeing his girlfriends boobs. His girlfriend kept telling him to shut up and just let me do the piercings so they can get it over with. I am straight and I’m engaged to a man but why does that even matter?? Even if I was into girls that doesn’t mean i’m going to just get turned on by piercing your girlfriends nipples?? 

I politely asked him if he would mind just standing outside while i done the piercings because I didn’t appreciate the questions he was asking me as they were extremely inappropriate. He then started accusing me of wanting to be alone with his girlfriend, he also spotted the engagement ring on my finger and said he felt sorry for whoever had to marry me knowing this is my job. I kept telling him to leave, he refused and started getting loud enough that he alerted several of my coworkers who all came in to see what was happening. 

My coworkers were eventually able to get him to leave and his girlfriend decided that she would leave with him. I told her that I still had no problem doing the piercings for her but she said that she didn’t want to make the situation any worse and she apologised for the trouble and left. Afterwards my manager told me that I should have just ignored what he was saying and just done the piercings. I just felt that him asking me If i was gonna be turned on by piercing his girlfriend was extremely gross and inappropriate?? Most of my coworkers agreed that I should have just ignored what he was saying and not have made a big deal out of it but i’m honestly just so conflicted. AITA?

It wasn’t there when i made the bed earlier that day, and then right there next to her, i find the vape while she was sleeping.   i asked her if she was still smoking it and she laughed and said no. i don’t try to pry so i left it there, thinking she wouldn’t be intentionally (potentially) harming our unborn child.

Now I’ll spare the conversation after that and what transpired, but am i the asshole? I’m being ignored and treated as so, for pointing out and questioning the obvious.

1kcnegm,AITA For Being Offended Over Not Being Included In My Family’s Matching “I Love You” TATOO,"Since my dad left my Mom, Sister and I have been tight. There for each other ya know? Some days ago my Mom and Sister came home spontaneously with matching “I Love You 3,000” tattoos. I asked them why I hadn’t been invited or included and my Mom snapped at me saying “they’re inspired by that dumb marvel movie you sister likes you wouldn’t have wanted one”. Um hello? I love marvel and have been collecting comics and memorabilia for years it’s what she gets me for my birthday and Christmas every year I would have loved to participate, and that’s what I told her. Then she changed her answer saying “not everything has to be equal and that’s life, sometimes you just don’t get included in family things.”. 

I don’t know how to feel I don’t wanna overreact it is just a tattoo but I feel bad being left out especially since we’ve talked about matching tats for years.

1kzg04r,AITA for refusing to accept the wrong drink at a restaurant nm,"Recently, my husband and I went to a restaurant with his family. My husband and I ordered their ""handmade"" margaritas. These were listed with your choice of anejo tequila with fresh sqeezed lime juice and simple syrup. However, when the margaritas arrived, they were in giant fishbowl margarita glasses (1 shot of tequila, plus lime and simple syrup cannot fill a 20 oz glass) and they were ORANGE. I immediately knew we were brought the house margaritas with the mixed sweet and sour, but I tried it anyway. It was awful. My husband shrugged and said he'd drink his, but at $20 each, I wasn't going to accept a cheap tequila with a mix. 

I called the waitress over and explained that we were given the wrong margaritas, but she insisted they were ""Handmade"". So I said, ""Ok. Well, it's not good. So you can just take it, I can't drink it. I don't want anything else, please just take it off the bill."" 

Which should have ended it, except she came back with the bartender holding the drink. He asked what was wrong, I told him what I ordered, he insisted that's what it was. So I asked, ""Then why is it orange? If it's lime and tequila and simple syrup, why is it orange?"" He looked at me, then looked at the drink and said, ""You're right. It's not the right drink. I can make you the right one and I'll remake his."" 

I said no, I didn't want a drink anymore, I just wanted it corrected on the bill to reflect the $10 margarita my husband actually received. They left, and I thought it was settled until the MANAGER came over and insisted they remake the margaritas to make it right. At this point I was annoyed and regretting not letting them remake it just to be left alone, but I also no longer even WANTED it, so I said, ""How about I just get a mezcal, neat, instead?"" That seemed to make the manager happy. But after the manager left, my husband said, ""Why didn't you just let them bring you a replacement the first time? Or just drink it when she told you it was right? You've made everyone uncomfortable."" My MIL said I was right to send it back, his brother told me I should have just given him my drink, and my SIL didn't say anything, so I'm wondering if I should have just let it be?",Familiar_Rice1923,3029,0.9399999976158142,315,1748640426,2025-05-30 16:27:06,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kzg04r/aita_for_refusing_to_accept_the_wrong_drink_at_a/,5,2025
1km0nfq,AITA for siding with our daughter and telling my ex he has to make good on his promise?,"I, 36f, co-parent Mila, 15f, with my ex Leo, 34m. We are civil to Mila, and only communicate via text. Since she was about 11, she has wanted to pierce her ears like a few of her friends have. My mom got my ears pierced when I was a toddler, so I was all for it, but Leo said no, and she had to be a bit older. 

Over Christmas, Mila was at Leo's, where she got him to promise that if she still wanted to pierce her ears after her birthday, he would take her to get her ears pierced. When he dropped off Mila, she excitedly told me that her dad had finally agreed. I think Leo was banking on Mila forgetting he had agreed, because she asked him to book the appointment for next weekend after her birthday, but she also wanted a helix piercing, and he called me to say he wanted me to say no. 

I told her that it was not fair of him to throw me under the bus or to back out, as he had promised her she could, and that I had agreed years ago she could, and it was now his problem to talk to her about it. 

Mila told me she had planned to go after school this week while she was with me, and I didn't tell Leo. Leo saw Mila's new piercings and blew up my phone that I didn't stop her or tell him, and I replied that it was important for him to show her that he would follow up on promises.  
Our custody agreement allows her to get piercings, and it is legal where we are for her to get them at 15.

1kw8lf9,AITA for asking a coworker not use the bathroom in my office?,"I work in a school (not as a teacher) where my designated workspace/office is a former teacher workroom. Having a traditional office wasn’t working because I was constantly having to find a larger space to do my job, so my admin moved me a few years ago. 

I love having the space, and it comes with the benefits of a printer and bathroom. I have never been a gatekeeper of the space and don’t mind when nearby staff members need to use it even though there’s another workroom a few doors down. 

I have one coworker who frequently (several times per week) uses the bathroom. Not to be crude, but the smell she leaves behind is toxic. I have put air fresheners in the bathroom and bought a bottle of poopouri, but it doesn’t help. I genuinely think she needs to see a doctor. 

We are both 12 month employees, so no summers off, and the heat has not helped with this issue. I pulled her aside last week and explained that I would appreciate if she found an alternative location to do her business. I’m fully aware that everybody poops, but that is my designated workspace, and I don’t want to have to smell it all day, especially when there are other bathrooms on campus that aren’t somebody’s office. 

She got upset and told some of our coworkers that I’m singling her out and not letting her use the bathroom. Some of them agree with me because they have smelled the aftermath, and some of them think I should have taken a different approach (asked for a different workspace/asked for more air fresheners, etc).

1kp5ed0,AITA for accusing my wife of using weaponized incompetence to get out of doing things she'd rather I do for her.,"The wife has been going to see a life coach and she a few months ago came back with the term ""weaponized incompetence"" which basically means a husband is intentionally failing to do a task he doesn't want to do, so that the wife will just do it herself to get out of helping out. This is something she accused me of doing after she pushed some of her household duties onto me. I was simply just learning how to do things in the way she likes after not doing them since we moved in together.

Ex. I started doing dishes, I washed them, put them up and she didn't like the way they were arranged because I arranged them by what we used the most, whereas she did it by height. ""Weaponized Incompetence"".

So recently, after a package was stolen off our door step while I was out of town, I started reviewing our front of house cameras and I saw my wife removing the doors off her jeep while preparing to take our sons to the beach. This is strange because until that moment, I had thought she couldn't do it herself as it's too heavy and/or complicated for her to do it herself. So I always did it for her. Not really an issue, I don't mind doing it for her, and I had just assumed she figured it out by herself since I wasn't there.

This Friday we decided to go for a nature drive, and my wife said she'd get everything ready while I was at work so we could go the second I got home. I got home and the doors were still on. I ask her why she didn't take the doors off. She said ""You know that's too heavy for me to do myself, I was waiting on you"". I told her I saw the video of her doing it through the front cams.

She got flustered and I quickly realized she probably could do this the entire time but just pretended not to be able to. I called it what it is, weaponized incompetence. She got incredibly mad and accused me of not wanting to help her ever and said I had been saving this to ""deflect"" from my own shortcomings. We had a huge fight and the trip ended up getting postponed, which disappointed our sons.

I don't think I was wrong to say what I said but here we are. Am I the Asshole?",ShenBapiro34,2182,0.8999999761581421,598,1747521881,2025-05-17 17:44:41,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kp5ed0/aita_for_accusing_my_wife_of_using_weaponized/,5,2025

1kt37vc,AITA for not letting my boyfriend come to my family’s vacation because I wanted some “me time”?,"I’m 20F and have been with my boyfriend (22M) for just under a year. Things are good between us, but I’m naturally very introverted and need alone time to recharge — especially after a stressful semester at university.

My parents invited me to join a short family vacation (5 days at a lake house), and I was really looking forward to just relaxing, reading, and spending time with them. When I mentioned the trip to my boyfriend, he immediately assumed he was invited too and said something like, “Awesome, I could really use that break too.”

I awkwardly told him that it was meant to be a small family trip and that I wanted some solo downtime without needing to “host” or be social all the time. He seemed surprised but didn’t say much then.

Now, days later, he’s clearly distant. He hasn’t brought it up directly, but he’s been short with me and mentioned feeling “excluded.” A mutual friend told me he thinks it’s weird I wouldn’t want him there, and now I’m wondering if I was selfish.

I just wanted a quiet trip, not relationship drama.

1kggjrd,AITA For telling a woman that I'm not at fault because she can't control her dog?,"Hey y'all! So, this morning I (25f) took my 6 month old lab/malinois mix puppy to the local park for a walk/training session. The way the park is set up is that there is a children's play area and a walking track that starts at the mouth of the play area and loops around the perimeter of the rest of the park (not the play area). So, on my final lap another couple with a medium mix breed dog gets out of a car and starts walking the path in the opposite way as me (so that we would meet in the middle). Once I notice them getting closer, I stepped off the path and start making my way to the parking lot, cutting through the grass because while my puppy is generally good with passing another dog no problem, I like to minimize the possibility of issues especially with us leaving. I'm still walking in the same direction I was, just about 50ft away from the path more in line with the parking lot. As we come almost parallel with this couple, their dog hits the end of its leash almost yanking the lady off her feet growling and barking and trying to get closer to us. I keep going, ignoring them and calling my puppy into a close heel to keep him from engaging with the other dog. This woman then proceeds to yell at me telling me that I'm at fault for her dog reacting and that I shouldn't be at the park cause I'm never there when they are and I'm the one causing a scene. I turn to this woman and tell her ""Don't blame me because you didn't train your dog and can't control him"". I then promptly continued and got to my car, loaded up my dog, and left, the whole time this lady is cussing me out and her dog is going even crazier. I was venting to my mom, and while she was empathetic, she told me that it was rude of me to respond instead of just continuing to walk away.

1kmu395,"AITA for telling my mom ""You lost two kids, do you want to lose another?"" when she treatened to kick me out?","Prefacing this with the fact that there is a lot of abuse and history I can't cram into a Reddit post.

My mom (50F) has always had problems with substance abuse, as well as untreated mental illness. After a few times of her getting drunk, one of which ended in a hospital visit, she vowed not to buy alcohol for herself. Her mental illness has led to the abuse, mostly mental, of me (20F) and my sister (17F).

The night of Mother's Day, my mom started drinking. She got inebriated. Every time she is drunk, it is a traumatic trigger for me. She lied to me and said she had two shots. Later she seemed more drunk, so I checked the trash and found ten shot bottles. I confronted her again and said that I wanted better for her and that she agreed to not have alcohol. She began to vent (she vents to me without my consent often) and scream to me about the loss of my siblings, which I did not know that was why she was drinking. This argument got heated, so I decided to go on a drive. Contacted my partner (19M) who offered to let me stay the night at his place. I accepted and went home to grab my things. My mother confronted me again. I said I was going to my partner’s house, and she threatened to kick me out of her home. She has done this on several occasions, then later told me that she ""never means it"" and says it ""only to instill the fear of god in me.""

When I came home, we had a discussion that I thought would fix things a little. I said it would be good for us to keep the alcohol out of the house and I could help find resources for therapy for her. She agreed to the alcohol, but declined therapy sternly. I also asked not to be threatened with homelessness which she did not seem receptive to.

Went to work the next day and came home. She begins an argument with me and states that ""if I wanted to not be homeless so bad, why doesn't she leave me the house and take my sister with her."" I asked if she would give me enough time to get a better job. She said ""I don't know."" I told her if she would leave me high and dry without that, which would be the same as being homeless, she would be throwing away the future she wanted for me (i would have to drop out of college to work) and i would go no-contact. She did not have remorse, and things got very heated until I said ""You lost two kids, do you want to lose another?"" in reference to going no-contact with her. I don't know if she interpreted it as that or taking my own life. She was, for lack of a better word, flabbergasted. I said ""I didn't want to pluck at your heartstrings but maybe that's what I need to get my point across."" She said ""that wasn't a pluck, that was a fatal blow.""

I have since apologized for what I said over text as I haven't been home as of the time of posting this.

It’s not a normal blender. It’s industrial strength. It's the kind of thing you’d use to puree cement.

She uses it *every single morning* at 6:00 a.m. to make a “power smoothie.” I have asked — politely, repeatedly — if she could maybe wait until like 8 a.m.? Or just make it the night before and keep it in the fridge?

She says (verbatim), “I have sensory needs and blending calms me.” She calls it her *emotional support blender*. She even named it. (**Gary.**) She says Gary helps her feel “in control of the chaos.”

I work night shifts and usually don’t get to bed until 3:00 a.m., so this means I'm getting jarred awake by a jet engine three hours into my sleep. Every. Day. Thanks Gary.

Last week, I lost it. I came out of my room, and said, “Tina, either Gary goes or I do.”

She cried. Legit tears. She said I was “ableist,” “cold,” and “don’t respect her coping mechanisms.” I feel bad now. Like, I *get* that people have mental health needs, but does it have to involve pulverizing frozen bananas at sunrise?

We were all having a great time and everyone presented and we cast our votes. Reading out loud the number of votes each person received. 
After winners were announced and flowers were given out, my boyfriend pulled me aside. He was incredibly upset that he hadn’t gotten any votes and that I had not voted for his presentation.

I told him I only got to cast two votes (1st and second place) I was just trying to vote for the ones I thought were the best and some of our friends put incredible amounts of effort into their presentations. Some friends dressed up, one friend wrote a song on guitar, another included a 3d animation they made in theirs. While I loved the presentation my boyfriend did, and the topic was really funny and he loved getting to share it with the group, other members of our group clearly put a lot more effort into theirs.
I told him it was a tough call but I didn’t want to be biased.

It was devastating. My sister (32F), who never wanted kids, announced she was pregnant two months later — a “miracle baby” after a one-night stand.

I congratulated her, but emotionally, I was still raw. I asked her not to talk about baby stuff constantly around me while I healed. She said I was being selfish and needed to “get over it.”

Fast forward — she had the baby, and now she’s constantly asking me (29F) to babysit. I declined gently at first, but recently I said I don’t feel emotionally ready to watch her child — the one she had after dismissing my grief.

She blew up, called me heartless, and said I’m punishing an innocent baby. My mom says I need to “be the bigger person” and “stop living in the past.” But I think I’m allowed to have boundaries.

1knjmh3,AITA for not inviting my brother’s fiancée to my wedding after she didn’t invite me to hers?,"So this has been bugging me for a while and now it's turning into family drama, so I need an outside perspective.

I’m (29F) getting married this fall. My brother (31M) is also recently engaged to his fiancée, let’s call her Lisa (28F). We’ve always been friendly, not super close or anything, but there was never any bad blood between us. At least, I didn’t think so.

Anyway, a few months back, they started sending out wedding invites. I didn’t get one. I waited a bit, thinking maybe it was a mistake or that mine was just late, but then I asked my brother about it — kind of awkwardly — and he straight-up told me Lisa didn’t want me there. When I asked why, he said she felt like I “draw too much attention” and she didn’t want “any distractions” on her big day.

That really hurt. I wasn’t planning to wear white or break into a choreographed dance or anything ridiculous. I just… show up, be supportive, enjoy the day. It felt like she saw me as some kind of threat, which honestly blindsided me.

Worse, my brother didn’t really stand up for me. He just said, “It’s her day, I want to support her,” and that was kind of that. I didn’t go. I tried to let it go even though it really stung.

Fast forward to now — my wedding is coming up and I decided not to invite Lisa. I invited my brother (just him), figuring I could at least try to maintain that relationship. But now he’s upset. He called and said I’m being petty and punishing him for something that wasn’t really his doing. I told him I just don’t feel comfortable having someone at my wedding who clearly didn’t want me at hers — it’s not about revenge, it’s about protecting my peace on my own day.

He said he won’t come without her and now our parents are getting involved. My mom thinks I did the right thing by setting a boundary, my dad says I should just invite her and not make it a bigger deal.

To combat this power thing my other roommate suggested we turn of the water heater and heat our bath water using a bucket that u plug in and stuff which suched for me coz I'm paying a lot of money for this room, it's currently winter and I go to school everyday (they dont) and still she keeps her lights on. My last straw was when she left for a whole week and she left her lights on, I can't even say she forgot atp coz clearly it's a habit. And guess what, we ran out. I ignored all her messages for me to contribute and lied about not having any money when i do, coz why do u care all of a sudden. It is irresponsible and bad for the environment plus my country has a power issue. I could have bought myself cheesecake with all that money I wasted. We can't all give the same amount when u are wasting the most.

1khbnh9,AITA for not “swapping apartments” with my sister?,"I (24F) live in a 2 family home that I share with my immediate family. My sister and her girlfriend (both 26F) live upstairs (3bed, 1bath) with our dad, while I share the downstairs (2bed, 1bath) with our mom. Recently, my sister moved her friend A (26ishF) into the guest room upstairs along with her cat after A escaped a bad relationship. Our mother (L) has been in Arizona tending to her very elderly father for about 6 months now, so I live alone downstairs. L is a bit of a hoarder and while she’s in AZ I’ve been slowly clearing out the apartment to make it functional again. I’ve spend many hours and a fair bit of my own money to accomplish this. Due to A and her cat moving in, upstairs now has 4 people and 4 animals (3 cats belong to A and my sister, and dad’s dog). 

This past weekend my sister approached me about swapping apartments for an undetermined amount of time, which I (stupidly and a little bit stunned) agreed to initially. I eventually retracted my agreement and decided I didn’t want to swap. There would be a lot of moving around and and my sister’s girlfriend (N) and L don’t get along due to mom’s generally shitty parenting in my sister and i’s childhood and N being kind of awful. After some snarky back and forth between my sister and I typical of our not great relationship, I pointed out it was a bit unfair that my sister moved in two of the people and three of the animals and is now complaining it’s cramped and trying to move into mom and I’s apartment despite all the work I’ve put in. She called me selfish, which I guess is kind of fair, so I figured I’d get some outside perspective.

1kfpbnw,AITA for confronting a parent after the comment she made to me?,"I (24F) am a high school teacher in a pretty wealthy small town. As far as teacher salaries go we are generally paid very well, but I also happen to be an incredibly frugal person. I have some goals for the future that are very important to me, so at this point in my life. So, especially when it comes to recurring expenses, I will choose the cheapest option available almost always. I could afford to pay more, but at this point in my life that doesn’t make sense to me.

Today, parent saw me buying canned chicken, a bag of rice, and some tortillas from a dollar store.(I don’t think she would ever step foot in a dollar store, but the store is next to a pretty fancy gym.) She started making comments to me about how she knows that we’re paid well, so it’s “unprofessional” to “make myself look poor” by buying food at the dollar store. I tried to deflect with humor like I usually do just talking about how I’m a cheapskate. That didn’t seem to work. She kept asking me questions about what the kids would think (I don’t think they care), and if I really want to be viewed that way (I don’t really care). I did have a chance to walk away, but I didn’t take it. Instead, I told her it was none of her business, and that on my free time I live whatever life I want to, and she has no say over that. That escalated the situation immensely. She ended up talking about how her taxes pay my salary.  That’s what I probably messed up because I followed up with “well then you should be happy. I’m making those tax dollars stretch.”

I had to have a conversation with my boss today because she sent him an email. He didn’t say I was wrong, he understood where I was coming from completely, but he did tell me I probably should’ve just let it go. Unprofessional? Maybe.

1krg6rl,AITA for refusing to engage with my dead husband's secret mistress?,"My husband passed away suddenly and violently a year ago. While cleaning out his items I uncoverd several letters from a female detailing a 10 year affair - mailed to our home that he had apparently intercepted.  We had his creamation and private family ceremony, and then one year later to the day i get a text message out of nowhere from a female claiming to be his girlfriend.  She claimed she was the love of his life, and she told me that she knew I was keeping his creemains away from her and she wanted half of them.  Which was odd as I woked witht the funeral home and organized events to bury his cremains in a private family ceremony a month after his passing.

This woman also took it upon herself to contact my inlaws (his sister and brothers) and beg them to take them into their lives, send them photos of my husband and her together and said that I was a rotten human he promised her he would leave for many years but never did.  She also contacted our 18 year old daughter and posed as a friend of her fathers, got her to meet up for coffee and started asking all sorts of personal questions about me and my relationsip and the funeral.

During her message to me she called me many names, and was very immature.  I also need to note that this woman is 60 years old - a full 15 years older than myself, and claimed that my husband and her had big plans and that i was a rotten person and she would prove it and tell my inlaws.

Am I the a-hole for telling this woman not to interfere with my family and his family and to leave my daughter alone? I have blocked her, but I'm pretty shaken up.  It feels like i have been blindsighted and am not allowed to move forward in my life, and how have to defend my marriage and myself to a stranger.

On multiple occasions I have been bumped for various reasons (school needed the pool) but the most frustrating interruption in my workout was when a lady showed up demanding the lane I was in 20 minutes into my workout. She said it was her lane and she wanted to teach her kid to swim 

I didn't love moving but decided it wasn't the hill to die on that day. 

Flash forward to today and 10 minutes or so into my workout she shows up, kid in tow and tells me it's her lane and I need to move. 

I told her that lanes weren't assigned in that way and I want to be let alone to continue my workout. 

She didn't care for that answer and went and got staff who all acted like I'm an asshole who should've just moved

1kw5ss6,"AITAH for exposing my sister’s financial manipulation of our elderly mom, even though it blew up the family?","My mom (72) is in the early stages of dementia. She’s still mostly clear-headed but has some confusion—especially when it comes to money. My younger sister “Chloe” (45) has always had a history of asking for financial help. Over the past few years, I noticed Mom was constantly ""lending"" Chloe money for things like car repairs, rent, or medical bills. Chloe always promised to pay her back, but she never did.

Meanwhile, Chloe’s social media told a very different story. Fancy trips, new gadgets, designer stuff… all while Mom was suddenly being super frugal. She even stopped buying things she used to enjoy. It didn’t sit right with me.

Mom asked me to help her look at her bank statements because she was confused. With her permission, I started going through them and what I found made my stomach drop. Chloe had been taking large amounts of money for years—way more than what she claimed she needed. It wasn’t help anymore, it was financial abuse.

I confronted Chloe, showed her the evidence, and she flipped. Accused me of being jealous, trying to control Mom, etc. I gathered everything and showed our other siblings and Mom’s financial advisor. It was brutal, but the truth was undeniable.

Now Chloe’s been cut off, and most of the family has distanced themselves from her. She’s livid, saying I destroyed her life and tore the family apart. Mom’s heartbroken by the conflict, which absolutely kills me. Some relatives think I should’ve handled it quietly or just let it go for the sake of Mom’s peace.

1kevlmt,AITAH My partner pays rent in my property,"I (31F) own a property that me and partner (31M) and our baby daughter live in. 
We split all bills 50/50 even though he earns more, I also buy her clothes, pay her swimming lessons and all the bits I notice that she needs. 
He has lived here for 2.5 years and I have lived here 5 years. I moved out of my parents when I was 17 and I worked my ass off to buy the place by myself 5 years ago. I was paying rent and saving for a mortgage at the same time, it was hard work and took dedication as I did not get any financial help.
He has asked to be added to the mortgage as he has been contributing here (monthly payments only), he says he is entitled to a share and his family have been doing research on that.
I feel hurt that they would do that, it feels like I’m not sure if I can trust him or them now. I haven’t had an easy journey to get to the security that I built for myself and I can be a bit over protective about that, especially now I have a child and inevitably I want to build her future too. 
I’m very careful not to put myself in vulnerable positions but now I feel I’m vulnerable. We have really disagreed on this, and he has moved out.
Morally I find it wrong that the father of my child, and his family would support him taking from me and his daughter. He said that would never happen, but why would they research it? And also, I’m not putting someone on the mortgage who does not have any actual investment to put down, it feels like he wants an easy ride to the property ladder.
Am I wrong to be upset? Am I the AH?

1kivn3t,AITA bf doesn't pay rent or do chores but is upset he can't decorate my home,"i (25f) and my bf (24m) just moved in together this year in february. we have been together for 3 and a half years. i paid a full years worth of rent up front for a trailer, and he is staying with me. he pays for some groceries very sparsely, and does not do any chores or household tasks/upkeep i ask him to do without constant reminders or becoming instantly defensive. at this point, he has started growing 4 small plants in the living room. it started as just a little project i could appreciate him engaging in, bc of the joy it brings him, but very quickly in two weeks spiraled into him demanding to have a practical green house and literal separate biome for these four baby plants. 

i am very put off by this, because there isn't a lot of space already, and on top of that, i don't feel like he does enough around the house to have a say in the decor, especially something so drastic (ie. running a humidifier constantly which can create mold in enclosed spaces, blockading my favorite window in the house with his grow lights etc.) he doesn't pay rent, hardly does chores without an argument, never cleans up after himself or the messes he makes, and the only thing he pays for has been the electricity bill (twice now) and two months of internet. that is it. 

tide pods, toilet paper, the bed we sleep on, furniture, shampoo, conditioner, hand soap- everything else in this home including the home itself i am paying for or have paid for and continue to pay for. every daily task/chore and weekly chore i do myself, since he puts them off for as long as he can. taking out trash, doing dishes, wiping surfaces, sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, laundry (including HIS CLOTHES TOO), cleaning his cat's litter box, replacing his cat's water, etc. AITA for feeling like he isn't deserving of completely changing the decor in the house whenever it suits him since he doesn't contribute to the home whatsoever?

We both work in the same company with the same schedules sometimes even until Sunday depending on what the job demands. We have always been very open about our 50/50 roles in our home like paying bills, laundry, chores etc. And that was never an issue. I got diagnosed with a thyroid problem that forces me watch what I eat and not let my weight go up no more than 80 pounds (I'm 74p and should be less that 70p) or it could trigger an uncontrollable weight gain and other problems. We used to eat whatever we wanted and that leaded me to gain some pounds in just 2 months. We decided that for dinner, each one would cook for themselves. He is more of a high protein/carbs intake kind of guy while I can't eat like that at night or I wouldn't sleep well. So my dinners are more like a small portion of protein, a light salad and hot tea. This worked out but little by little he has been asking me to make his dinner. At first I was like hey I'm already here so why not. But that has been turning into a routine. So I end up making 2 different dishes every night. That's not the bad part. When we are dinning, he is always putting from his food on my plate and I know it tastes good. (I made it) hus excuse? I'm not eating enough and he worries. I'm thankful he does, but everything I eat too much, I wake up very tired the next day.

1kp6qgp,AITA for refusing to babysit my sister’s kids after she called me “selfish” for prioritizing my career?,"I (28F) have been working hard to build my career in graphic design. I recently landed a big freelance contract that requires a lot of late nights and focus, which I’m thrilled about since it could open major doors for me. My sister “Jen” (32F) is a single mom of two kids (6M and 4F), and I’ve always tried to help her out when I can, like watching the kids for a few hours here and there or picking them up from daycare if she’s stuck at work.
Last week, Jen asked me to babysit her kids for three full days (Friday-Sunday) because she got a last-minute invite to a friend’s bachelorette party out of town. I told her I couldn’t because I have a tight deadline for this contract, and I’d already committed to working through the weekend. She got upset and said she “really needed this break” and that I was being selfish for always putting my job first. I suggested she ask our parents or a friend, but she said I was her “best option” because the kids love me and I’m “free” (I don’t charge her, but I also don’t get paid for my time).
Things escalated when she called me the next day, saying I was “abandoning family” and that I’d “regret choosing work over her and the kids.” I got frustrated and told her I’m not her built-in babysitter and that she needs to plan better instead of guilting me. She hung up and hasn’t spoken to me since. Now my mom is saying I could’ve been more understanding since Jen’s had a rough year, but I feel like I’m allowed to prioritize my own life sometimes.

1kul2is,AITA for bringing my neighbors packages inside my apartment because I was worried they’d get stolen?,"I (28F) live in a mid-rise apartment building in the city. We don’t have a front desk or package lockers—just a narrow hallway where all deliveries get dumped. If you’re not home within a few hours, good luck.

My across-the-hall neighbor, Marcus (30s? late 20s? I honestly don’t know), gets a lot of packages. Fancy ones too—clothing boxes with brand names, curated subscription kits, expensive-looking stuff. I'm not trying to spy or anything, but when you live in close quarters, you notice these things. I’d occasionally see boxes just sitting out overnight while he was clearly out of town, which made me anxious on his behalf.

About six weeks ago, I heard him swearing in the hall and went out to see what was wrong. He said one of his packages—some cologne he’d ordered—got stolen. He looked genuinely upset and mentioned it wasn’t the first time. I said something like, “Man, this building really needs lockers or something.” He nodded but didn’t push it.

So after that, I started bringing his deliveries inside my apartment whenever I noticed they’d been sitting for more than a few hours. Just to be safe. I stacked them in a corner near my front door and gave them back when I saw him. Usually, he just said thanks and took them. No big conversation.

Then last week, he knocked and asked me to stop.

He wasn’t rude about it, but he looked super uncomfortable. He said he appreciated the intention, but it made him uneasy to know his stuff was in someone else’s apartment. He added that it felt like I was “tracking his movements” since I always seemed to know when he wasn’t home.

I was kind of stunned. I explained that I was just trying to help—that I wasn’t snooping, I just saw stuff piling up. He said, “I get it, but... yeah, it crosses a line. Please don’t touch my packages anymore.”

I said okay, and he left. But now I feel weird. I genuinely thought I was doing a good deed. I wasn’t opening his stuff, just holding it for a few hours until he got back. It’s not like I was rifling through his mail.

But then it got more awkward. A few days ago I saw him through his peephole (yes, I was walking to my door, not lurking lol), and he literally waited until I went back inside before he came out to grab his box. Like he’s timing it now?

Then this morning, I overheard him talking to another neighbor while checking his mail. He said something like, “Yeah, some people think doing favors means ignoring boundaries.” I don’t know he meant me, but… it felt pointed.

Now I’m second-guessing everything. I told my sister and she said it was “weirdly possessive” and that I should’ve just left a note asking if he wanted help next time. But I never thought it would turn into this.

So... AITA for taking matters into my own hands when I thought I was doing something neighborly?

1ktw147,UPDATE - AIAT For Refusing To Pay My Cat-Sitter?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kndv4r/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_catsitter/)

I have been incredibly busy with handling my job (apparently three people were fired in my absence) and caring for Daisy since making my original post, but I've read many of the comments and understand that many people have questions and want an update, so I'm taking my first real free moment since coming back from my vacation to fill you all in on what's been happening.

I took Daisy to the vet the day after making my original post due to the scratches I found on her. Like I mentioned in comments, they were 2-3 inches in length and had dried blood on them. The vet's opinion was that they were decently deep and likely infected, which was later confirmed and Daisy was prescribed meds to deal with that. She's much better now and seems to be back to near-perfect health, but there will be subsequent visits to determine if she has any other issues (such as FIV, which can't be accurately tested for so soon).

My vet was kind enough to give me quote for the future visits I have scheduled, which I presented along with the bill from this visit to Ava and her parents (who ended up getting involved as well, but were much less aggressive than Ava or BIL). The current bill by itself exceeds what we had agreed to pay Ava. Ava tried to push back more, which I ignored, and then her parents reached out to me. The four of us (me, Ava, her mom and her dad) met up, and Ava's parents immediately brought up small claims court and asked that I please not drag them and their daughter through the system over a vet bill. Just to be clear, I **never** threatened to do so. The only time court came up was when BIL brought it up to me (and I'm assuming Ava as well) and I insisted that I didn't want to make this a legal matter. I told Ava's parents the same, that I was not seeking legal action, and was happy to consider us square. The only other thing I wanted was for Ava to apologize for endangering Daisy. She didn't seem happy, but she said sorry, and that was that.

I'm glad my cat is safe and healthy and I'm glad the drama is over. Safe to say I wont be planning any more trips away until my regular sitter is available again.

There are a few other questions I noticed in the comments that I'd like to answer, they will be in a comment I post below.

1ksa91j,AITA for telling my dad I don't want him to marry his girlfriend?,"Honestly this is embarrassing so I am using a throwaway.

My parents (both 46) got divorced 6 years ago. My mom remarried 3 years ago, and my dad has had a few girlfriends. His current girlfriend is the only one he has ever brought around. My mom has met her and likes her, and my sister idolizes her. She's nice and I don't dislike her. 

The actual problem: she's 27, exactly 10 years older than me. To me, it's so weird. I dont understand why my dad wants to date someone so much younger than him. When he asked my sister and I if we were okay with him asking her to marry him, my sister was excited. I wasn't. I told him i wasn't comfortable with the age gap and thought she was just a sugar baby. Dad explained she has her own career, but said okay. 

Since that conversation, my dad has been really sad, and the atmosphere in his house has changed. His girlfriend hasn't been by as frequently either. I feel kind of bad because I want my dad to be happy. Aita?

Edit: this blew up bigger than I expected it to and found it's way to my dad. Now he wants to have a talk this weekend.
